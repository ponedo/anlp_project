837_F.3d_1316
United States Court of Appeals Federal Circuit
LIFENET HEALTH Plaintiff-Appellee
v. LIFECELL CORPORATION Defendant-Appellant
2015-1549
| Decided : September 16 2016
Synopsis
Background : Patentee brought action against a competitor complaining that the competitor 's `` ready to use '' plasticized_soft_tissue_grafts infringed on its patent governing the production and use of plasticized tissue_grafts
Following a jury verdict on direct infringement and patent validity the United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Virginia Henry Coke Morgan Jr. Senior District Judge 93_F.Supp.3d_477 denied competitor 's motion for judgment as a matter of law on claim_construction non-infringement and invalidity and for new_trial
Competitor appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Prost Chief_Judge held that :

competitor did not properly raise its argument that district_court erred by failing to resolve legal dispute regarding scope of non-removal limitation ;

on issue of non-infringement whether plasticizer was removed from internal_matrix of accused tissue_grafts before transplantation was for jury ;

accused tissue_grafts were complete when they left competitor 's hands and infringed patent in that condition without affirmative action by any third party ;

non-removal limitation did not mix apparatus with method using that apparatus and thus it was not indefinite on that ground ;

term `` plasticized_soft_tissue_graft '' meant `` free and loosely bound waters of hydration in the tissue have been replaced with one or more_plasticizers '' without requiring that graft be `` dehydrated '' ; and

on issue of obviousness whether prior art disclosed `` plasticized_soft_tissue_graft '' was question for jury

Affirmed

Opinion
Prost Chief_Judge
Defendant-Appellant LifeCell Corporation ( `` LifeCell '' ) appeals from a final_judgment of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern_District of Virginia entered in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee LifeNet Health ( `` LifeNet '' )
Following claim_construction and trial a jury found LifeNet 's U.S. Patent No._6569,200 ( `` '200_patent `` ) infringed by LifeCell and not invalid
The district_court denied LifeCell 's motion for a new_trial and renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law ( `` JMOL '' ) on inter alia claim_construction non-infringement and invalidity
The district_court subsequently entered a final_judgment consistent with the jury 's findings on infringement validity and damages
We affirm

BACKGROUND
LifeNet 's '200_patent claims plasticized_soft_tissue_grafts suitable for transplantation *1320 into humans
Such grafts are useful in various medical orthopedic dental and cosmetic surgery applications
The '200_patent explains that tissue_grafts are typically preserved and provided in a dehydrated state such as through freeze-drying then rehydrated before implantation
The patent explains that the freeze-drying process is not optimal : it can cause the tissue to become brittle with a tendency to fracture ; it requires time in the operating room to rehydrate the tissue ; and even after rehydration the tissue 's properties do not approximate that of normal_tissue and the graft can fail

The '200_patent 's `` plasticized '' tissue_grafts avoid these problems
The tissue is preserved not by freeze-drying but by replacing the tissue 's water with biocompatible plasticizers such as glycerol that provide the hydrating functions of water
These plasticized grafts exhibit properties similar to that of normal_tissue and avoid the rehydration process required for freeze-dried tissue

The specification explains that while the plasticizers can be removed prior to implantation they need not be
It therefore discloses various options for the implanting clinician : ( 1 ) `` direct_implantation of the grafts without further processing following removal from the packaging '' ; ( 2 ) `` implantation following a brief washing in sterile_isotonic_saline to remove any remaining traces of plasticizer associated with the immediate surfaces of the grafts '' ; or ( 3 ) `` implantation following an extended ( approximately 1 hour ) washing with sterile_isotonic_saline to remove as much plasticizer as possible ''
'200_patent col. 12_ll._9 -16

LifeNet asserted claims 1-4 7 8 and 10 in this case
Claims 1-4 are apparatus claims while claims 7 8 and 10 are method claims
All of the asserted claims require that `` one or more_plasticizers are not removed from [ an ] internal_matrix of [ the ] plasticized_soft_tissue_graft prior to transplantation into a human '' ( or `` the non-removal limitation '' )
For example claim 1 recites : 1
A plasticized_soft_tissue_graft suitable for transplantation into a human comprising : a cleaned soft_tissue_graft having an internal_matrix ; and
one or more_plasticizers contained in said internal_matrix ; said one or more_plasticizers are not removed from said internal_matrix of said plasticized_soft_tissue_graft prior to transplantation into a human
Id.at col. 24_ll._10 -16 ( emphasis added )

The non-removal limitation was added to the claims during prosecution in response to a rejection based on the Cavallaro reference U.S. Patent No._5718,012 ( `` '012_patent `` )
Cavallaro also discloses using plasticizers in tissue constructs
In Cavallaro the plasticizers are used to improve the tensile strength of collagen threads and after such `` conditioning treatment the plasticizer must.. be removed ''
'012_patent col. 7_ll._40 -43
Following the examiner 's rejection for anticipation by Cavallaro LifeNet amended its claims to add the requirement that `` one or more_plasticizers are not removed from an internal_matrix of [ the ] plasticized_soft_tissue_graft prior to transplantation into a human ''
J.A
192
As support for the amendment LifeNet recited the following language from the specification : `` Replacement of the chemical plasticizers by water prior to implantation is not required and thus the.. soft tissue plasticized product can be place [ d ] directly into an implant site without.. '' J.A
193 ( first and third alterations in original )

LifeCell 's accused products are soft_tissue_grafts preserved in a plasticizer solution called Solution E. It is undisputed that *1321 users of the accused products are instructed to soak the tissue_grafts in saline solution for a minimum of two minutes prior to implantation and that a significant amount of plasticizers are removed during this two-minute_rinse
LifeCell contends there is no evidence to suggest that surgeons have ever implanted the accused products without following those instructions

During claim_construction proceedings the parties disputed the meaning of several terms including the non-removal limitation
The parties ' dispute at the time centered on the degree of plasticizer removal-whether this limitation required that no plasticizer be removed ( LifeCell 's position ) or allowed for some but not all plasticizer to be removed ( LifeNet 's position )
Specifically LifeCell 's proposed construction was that `` no processing steps are taken before transplantation into a human that result in any amount of the one or more_plasticizers being taken out of the internal_matrix of the plasticized_soft_tissue_graft ''
J.A
409 ( emphasis added )
LifeNet proposed that the term meant `` without complete replacement of the plasticizer or plasticizers in the internal_matrix of the tissue_graft prior to direct_implantation into a human ''
Id
( emphasis added )
The district_court concluded in its Markman order that construction of the entire term was `` unnecessary '' observing that the two-word phrase `` 'not removed ' is easily understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art to have its plain meaning that no plasticizers are removed prior to transplantation ''
J.A
65
The district_court later denied LifeCell 's motion for summary judgment that this limitation rendered claims 1-4 indefinite for allegedly including a method step in an apparatus claim

At trial LifeCell argued non-infringement based on evidence showing that as much as 50 % of the plasticizer in the accused products is removed during the two-minute saline rinse
According to LifeCell this undisputed removal of plasticizers meant that its products do not meet the claim limitation requiring that plasticizers are `` not removed ''
In response LifeNet did not dispute that plasticizers are removed from the accused tissue_grafts during the two-minute_rinse but maintained that no plasticizers are removed from the internal_matrix of the tissue_graft as recited in the non-removal limitation
According to LifeNet 's expert Dr. David Kaplan the only plasticizer removed during the rinse is `` nonbound '' plasticizer that exists in the gaps and voids of the tissue_grafts not plasticizer `` bound '' to the graft 's internal_matrix
J.A
8230-31

After a two-week trial the jury found that LifeCell 's accused tissue_grafts infringed the '200_patent
It also found that LifeCell had failed to establish any of its invalidity defenses and awarded LifeNet $ 34,741,971 in damages
After briefing and oral argument the district_court denied LifeCell 's post-trial motions
LifeCell timely filed this appeal
