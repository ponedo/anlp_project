Opinion
RADER Circuit_Judge
On summary_judgment the United_States_District_Court for the Southern_District of Ohio found Trintec Industries Inc. 's United States Patent No._5818,717 ( ¡¬717_patent ) invalid as inherently anticipated
Trintec Indus
v. Top-U.S.A. Corp. No
C-2-99-1179 ( S.D.Ohio Jun._19,_2001 )
Because the ¡¬ 717 patent is not inherently anticipated this court vacates and remands

I. Trintec is the assignee of the ¡¬717_patent
The inventor Brendon G. Nunes *1294 filed the ¡¬717_patent application on June_2,_1993
The ¡¬ 717 patent claims a cost-effective method of producing in low_volume multicolor_faces for watches clocks thermometers and other_instruments
The method includes making a graphic instrument face in a computer transmitting electronic signals from the computer to a color printer or photocopier printing the face on sheet material cutting it and assembling it into an instrument

Top-U.S.A
Corporation produces watches and clocks with customized faces and has done so for over eighteen years
Initially Top created and printed its customized graphics using pad printing engraving silk screening or photography
Those methods were expensive and required extensive set-up time
Thus these older methods were ill-suited to small-volume custom design and printing
Desktop publishing 's advent in the late 1980s mitigated the design side of this problem but high-resolution color printing remained prohibitively expensive
With color laser printer advances however Top was using that technology to make custom watches and clocks by 1995

Sweda Company LLC also is in the customized watch business
In a 1991-92 catalogue ( Sweda_catalogue ) Sweda advertised the availability at an inexpensive price of small-volume multi-color watches produced by `` a new computer laser printer ''
The Sweda_catalogue was not before the examiner of the ¡¬717_patent during its prosecution

On November 2 1999 Trintec asserted the ¡¬717_patent against Top in the district_court
Trintec alleged that Top infringed independent claims 3_and_8 and associated dependent claims 4-5 12 and 13
Trintec filed a motion for summary_judgment of infringement intentional infringement and validity
Top filed a cross-motion for summary_judgment that the asserted claims either were anticipated or obvious in view of the Sweda_catalogue
The district_court found that the Sweda_catalogue inherently anticipated the asserted claims and granted summary_judgment of invalidity
Having determined that prior art anticipated the ¡¬717_patent the district_court did not reach obviousness and dismissed the case with prejudice
Trintec appeals the district_court 's summary_judgment of invalidity
This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( 2000 )
