Before NEWMAN CLEVENGER and DYK Circuit_Judges
Opinion
NEWMAN Circuit_Judge
Inline Plastics Corporation sued EasyPak LLC for infringement of United States Patent No._7118,003 ( the ¡¬003_patent ) and No._7073,680 ( the ¡¬680_patent ) directed to tamper-resistant_plastic_food_containers
Following the district_court 's claim_construction Inline moved for entry of final_judgment of non-infringement of its ¡¬003_patent on the premise that the claims as construed are not infringed
Inline also granted EasyPak a covenant not to sue on the ¡¬680_patent
The district_court then entered final_judgment of non-infringement of the ¡¬003_patent dismissed without prejudice EasyPak 's declaratory_judgment_counterclaims for invalidity and dismissed Inline 's count for infringement of the ¡¬680_patent with prejudice.1

Inline appeals the district_court 's construction of the claims of the ¡¬003_patent stating that the terms `` frangible_section '' and `` tamper_evident_bridge '' were incorrectly construed
We conclude that on the facts and specification of the ¡¬003_patent the district_court erred in limiting the claims to a specific embodiment for the invention as claimed is supported by the patent 's broader disclosure
We vacate the judgment of non-infringement of the ¡¬003_patent and remand for determination of infringement in accordance with the corrected claim_construction

THE ¡¬003_PATENT
The patented products are plastic food containers having the described tamper-evident and tamper-resistant features
The containers have a hinged plastic bridge between the top and bottom portions of the container the bridge having a frangible_section that must be severed in order to open the container
Thus tampering or opening of the container is readily evident

Figure 1 of the ¡¬003_patent shows an embodiment of the tamper-resistant container having a cover_portion 12 and a base_portion 14 joined by a hinge 16
The hinge includes a tamper-evident pull strip 18 which upon removal severs the connection between cover 12 and base 14 :

?
*1367 The parties agree that claims 1_and_2 are representative : 1
A tamper-resistant/evident container comprising : a ) a plastic transparent cover_portion including an outwardly extending peripheral flange ; b ) a base_portion including an upper_peripheral_edge forming at least in part an upwardly projecting bead extending substantially about the perimeter of the base_portion and configured to render the outwardly extending flange of the cover_portion relatively inaccessible when the container is closed ; and
c ) a tamper_evident_bridge connecting the cover_portion to the base_portion
2
A tamper-resistant/evident container as recited in claim 1 wherein the tamper_evident_bridge includes a hinge joining the outwardly extending flange of the cover_portion with the base_portion the hinge including a frangible_section which upon severing provides a projection that extends out beyond the upwardly projecting bead of the upper_peripheral_edge of the base_portion for facilitating removal of the cover_portion from the base_portion to open the container
EasyPak 's accused containers embody all of the elements of claims 1_and_2
However the EasyPak frangible_section has a single score line along which the cover is severed from the base whereas the ¡¬003_patent 's preferred embodiment as shown in Figure 1 has two score lines at the frangible_section
The district_court construed `` frangible_section '' to mean `` a removable tear strip delimited by at least two severable_score_lines ''
Inline Plastics Corp. v. EasyPak LLC No._11- cv-11470-TSH 2013_WL_2395998 at *10 ( D.Mass
Jan._22,_2013 ) ( `` Claim_Construction_Order '' )
The district_court acknowledged that it limited the claims to the embodiment shown in Figure 1 and stated that `` declarations made during patent prosecution to surpass the prior art reveal a definitive focus on the removability of the frangible *1368 section and thus clearly and unambiguously disavow any other embodiment to the contrary ''
Claim_Construction_Order at *6
The district_court recognized that claims 1_and_2 did not contain a limitation to two severable_score_lines but reasoned that the prosecution history supported this limitation
That is the issue on appeal
