Opinion
MAYER Chief_Judge
The Mead Corporation ( `` Mead '' ) appeals from the judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of Georgia holding that Mead infringed claims 1_and_13 of U.S. Patent No._5241,806 ( `` the '806_patent `` ) owned by Riverwood_International Corporation ( `` Riverwood '' ) and that these claims were not invalid for obviousness
See Riverwood_Int ' l_Corp. v. Mead_Corp. No._1 :94-CV-0090-CAM ( N.D.Ga
Jan._13,_1999 ) ( `` Order '' )
Because the district_court erroneously concluded as a matter of law that the *1366 claims were not invalid for obviousness we reverse

Background
This appeal arises out of a patent infringement dispute over cartoners
Cartoners are machines designed to automatically group_articles such as beverage cans or bottles and load them into paperboard_cartons
Cartoners are usually used in industrial applications such as beverage bottling facilities
Riverwood owns the rights to the '806_patent embodied in practice by its TwinStack model
Claim 1 and dependent claim 13 of the '806_patent are the only claims at issue
These two claims cover a cartoner with three incoming streams of articles and a barrel_cam_loader
This type of cartoner is known in the art as a three-conveyer_cartoner
The loader which is usually a barrel_cam or an angulated guide in the prior art forces the articles into the cartons
A barrel_cam pushes the articles in a manner similar to a horizontal escalator whereas an angulated guide works passively merely providing a static wall or rail to divert the path of the otherwise propelled articles

After Mead developed and marketed its DuoStack model a three-conveyer_cartoner with a barrel_cam_loader Riverwood brought suit for infringement of the '806_patent
The district_court appointed a special_master pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 53 to hear evidence and arguments from the parties
The special_master made findings of fact and concluded inter alia that claims 1_and_13 of the '806_patent were invalid for obviousness
See Riverwood_Int ' l_Corp. v. Mead_Corp. No._1 :94-CV-0090-CAM ( N.D.Ga
Mar._11,_1998 ) ( `` Report '' )
The district_court accepted the findings of fact in whole and without modification but contrary to the special_master concluded that the claims would not have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art
See Order at 3
Mead appeals this aspect of the district_court 's judgment
