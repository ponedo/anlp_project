Because we conclude that the district_court properly granted summary_judgment of noninfringement we affirm

*1352 BACKGROUND
Bai is the inventor and owner of the '076_patent directed to a `` target_game ''
He asserted that Wings 's MAGIC_CATCH target_game infringes claim 1 of his patent
MAGIC_CATCH is similar to the invention of claim 1 but has one primary difference
While the patent discloses and claims a `` hemispherical '' glove as shown below

?
the MAGIC_CATCH 's glove is saucer- or Frisbee THE_R-shaped
In other words the plastic backside of the MAGIC_CATCH glove is largely flat in the middle but curved on the ends
At issue in this case is whether the limitation `` hemispherical '' excludes Wings 's largely flat product

The patent application as originally filed had the following three claims that are relevant here : 1
A target_game including : a glove ; a sheet of fabric_material mounted on the glove and extending across the front_face thereof to constitute a target for a missile thrown thereagainst
2
The target_game defined in claim 1 in which the glove is formed of a rigid plastic material and has a dish shape
3
The target_game defined in claim 2 in which the sheet of fabric_material is mounted on the glove in spaced relationship therewith so as to present a resilient_surface which is deflectable inwardly when struck by the missile

The examiner rejected all the claims particularly dependent claim 3 on obviousness grounds over a combination of four patents : Muchnick U.S._Patent 3,953,030 ; Craig U.S._Patent 1,633,926 ; Lemelson et al. U.S._Patent 3,857,566 ; and Hartel U.S._Patent 3,378,260
Specifically the examiner stated that it would have been obvious to combine the dish-shaped structure disclosed in the Hartel_patent with the `` target '' disclosed in the Lemelson patent and that because the Lemelson_target is hand-held it is a kind of glove that can be substituted for the gloves disclosed in the Muchnick and Craig patents
In response Bai canceled claims 2_and_3 and amended claim 1 to incorporate the claim 2_and_3 limitations and to add the limitation that the glove was `` hemispherical
`` 1 Bai remarked that he was amending claim 1 to `` specifically and expressly recite the structural details '' of his invention noting its `` particular configuration ''
He distinguished the gloves disclosed in Muchnick and Craig as having different structures and functions from the amended claim and distinguished the Lemelson_target as not having a glove
Bai did not address the Hartel_patent but summarily stated that he believed the other references cited by the examiner were irrelevant
The examiner then allowed amended claim 1 which reads as follows :

1
A target_game including : a glove formed of a hemispherical dish-shaped rigid plastic_member a strap mounted *1353 on the rear side of the plastic_member to enable the glove to be held on the palm of the hand of a player ; a sheet of fabric_material mounted on the glove and extending across the front_face of the dish-shaped rigid plastic_member to constitute a target for a missile thrown thereagainst said sheet of fabric_material being mounted on the plastic_member in spaced relationship with the inner surface thereof so as to present a resilient_surface which is deflectable inwardly when struck by the missile
( emphasis added )
Bai filed suit against Wings for patent infringement
The parties filed cross-motions for summary_judgment on the question of infringement focusing in their briefs on the term `` hemispherical '' and also addressing the prosecution history estoppel presumption established by the Supreme Court in Warner-Jenkinson v. Hilton Davis Chem Co. 520_U.S._17 117_S.Ct._1040 137_L.Ed.2d_146 41_USPQ2d_1865_(1997)
In its opinion the district_court construed the term `` hemispherical '' to include structures that are `` less than a sphere but.. nevertheless a part of a sphere '' apparently because the glove pictured in Figure 2 is close to a hemispherical shape although it is not exactly hemispherical
See Bai 1997_WL_527870 at *2
The district_court concluded that the MAGIC_CATCH 's `` perceptibly flattened surface '' did not meet the claim limitation `` hemispherical '' and thus did not literally infringe claim 1
Bai 1997_WL_527870 at *2
The court also concluded that Bai added the term `` hemispherical '' in response to the ¡± 103 rejection and that Bai did not establish that this amendment was unrelated to patentability
See id. 1997_WL_527870 at *4-*5
The court thus concluded that prosecution history estoppel limited Bai to products that are hemispherical in shape and accordingly held that MAGIC_CATCH did not infringe claim 1 under the doctrine of equivalents
See id. 1997_WL_527870 at *5
This appeal followed
We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( 1994 )
