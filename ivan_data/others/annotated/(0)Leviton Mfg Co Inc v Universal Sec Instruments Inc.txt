I
BACKGROUND
On October 22 2003 Leviton filed U.S. Patent Application No._10 /690,776 ( `` Germain_application '' ) which claims priority to a February 3 2003 provisional application
Greenberg_Traurig attorneys Paul Sutton Barry Magidoff and Claude Narcisse filed and prosecuted the Germain_application
It lists Franz Germain and five others as co-inventors
Each of these inventors submitted to the U.S. Patent and Trademark_Office ( `` PTO '' ) a sworn declaration that he was an original_inventor of the subject_matter which was claimed

Six months later on April_19,_2004 Leviton filed U.S. Patent Application No._10 /827,093 which later issued as U.S._Patent_No._6864,766 ( `` the ¡¬766_patent `` )
The ¡¬766 is a third-generation continuation of U.S._Patent_No._6246,558 ( `` the ¡¬558_patent `` )
The application for the ¡¬558_patent was filed on August 20 1999 and Leviton has claimed that the ¡¬766_patent is entitled to this priority_date
Nicholas DiSalvo and William_Ziegler are named as the inventors of the ¡¬766_patent
Both of these inventors also submitted to the PTO a sworn declaration that he was an original_inventor of the subject_matter which was claimed

The ¡¬766_patent and the Germain_application have no common inventors and neither claims priority to the other
The ¡¬766_patent 's claimed 1999 priority_date is three and a half years before Germain 's claimed 2003 priority_date
The ¡¬766_patent and Germain have many claims that are nearly identical
For example the only difference between claim 1 of the ¡¬766_patent and claim 31 of the Germain_application is that claim 1 recites `` at least one moveable bridge '' whereas claim 31 recites `` a movable bridge ''
And dependent claims 3 4 13_and_14 of the ¡¬766_patent are identical to Germain claims 32 31 43_and_44

Meihao and Leviton offer different explanations as to the similarity of the claims
Meihao contends that Narcisse `` copied '' the claims from the Germain_application into the application that matured into the ¡¬766_patent
Leviton explains the similarity by stating that several months after Narcisse filed the Germain_application he met with several Leviton engineers including William_Ziegler one of the inventors of the ¡¬558_patent
At that meeting Narcisse learned that the broad reverse-wiring protection concept he claimed in the Germain_application had actually been described in the ¡¬558_patent over three years earlier having already been invented by Ziegler and DiSalvo
Afterwards Narcisse prepared a continuation of the ¡¬558_patent with claims directed to that feature

During the prosecution of the ¡¬766_patent Leviton did not disclose the Germain_application or the fact that certain claims had been copied from Germain into the application for the ¡¬766_patent
Moreover Leviton did not inform the PTO that it had previously submitted a sworn declaration in which other individuals ( the Germain inventors ) claimed to be inventors of subject_matter very similar to that which was now recited in the application for the ¡¬ 766 patent

In June_3,_2005 two months after the ¡¬766_patent issued Leviton disclosed the *1357 ¡¬766_patent the ¡¬558_patent and thirty other references during the prosecution of the Germain_application
In September 2005 having learned of the substantively identical claims the PTO issued a double-patenting rejection of the Germain_application in light of the ¡¬766_patent
Leviton cancelled the similar claims

A reexamination of the ¡¬766_patent was requested on June_6,_2005
Leviton did not disclose the Germain_application or the related litigation to the PTO during the seven months in which the examiner reconsidered the patentability of the ¡¬766_patent
On February 17 2006 the examiner confirmed all claims of the ¡¬766_patent and the reexamination requestor appealed
Leviton filed its appeal brief on June_16,_2006 but did not disclose the Germain_application or related litigations to the PTO though it had been aware of inequitable_conduct allegations for over a year

Narcisse first referenced the Germain_application and asserted that it was not material information in a memorandum to the PTO dated August 7 2007
Although Narcisse titled his memorandum `` Information_Disclosure_Statement '' ( `` IDS '' ) it is not formally an IDS because it does not meet any of the requirements for an IDS
Narcisse also submitted several standard PTO forms titled `` Information_Disclosure_Statement by Applicant '' that comply with PTO rules but these IDS forms did not list the Germain_application

During the district_court case Meihao sought discovery of the facts related to the inequitable_conduct defense
Meihao argued that Leviton 's counsel unreasonably and self-servingly tried to avoid discovery of Leviton 's own misconduct
When Meihao issued subpoenas to Sutton Magidoff and Narcisse the witnesses did not object did not produce documents and did not appear for their scheduled depositions
Leviton belatedly moved to quash primarily on the ground that the witnesses were acting as Leviton 's litigation counsel
In March 2007 Greenberg_Traurig withdrew and was replaced by Nixon Vanderhye

Narcisse and Magidoff subsequently appeared for depositions and Leviton 's new counsel made numerous privileged advice and work_product_objections and repeatedly instructed the witnesses not to answer
During Narcisse 's deposition counsel made 96 privileged advice and work_product_objections and over a third of the time explicitly instructed Narcisse not to answer
Many of these questions were about the relationship between the Germain_application and claim 1 of the ¡¬766_patent or Narcisse 's rationale for failing to disclose the Germain_application to the PTO
For example Narcisse declined to answer the following questions claiming the work-product exception : ¡E Can you tell me with respect to Claim 1 where you got the language for Claim 1 ?
¡E So is n't it a fact that Claim 1 of the ¡¬766 application was copied from Claim 31 of the Germain_application ?
¡E Can you tell me where you got the phrase `` move-able bridge '' ?
¡E Did you consider disclosing the Germain_application to the PTO ?
¡E How do you explain the similarity in claim language ?
Magidoff refused to answer similar questions also on advice and objection by counsel
The district_court found that these objections were baseless

Another round of briefing ensued with Meihao seeking an order compelling Narcisse and Magidoff to appear for further *1358 deposition and to fully answer Meihao 's questions and also compelling Sutton to appear for deposition
The matter was argued and submitted to Magistrate_Judge_Gauvey on September 17 2007
Meihao 's motions to compel were still pending when Leviton moved to dismiss the case in November 2007 but the magistrate_judge noted that he was about to grant them

On November 28 2007 Leviton moved to dismiss the case
Leviton asserts that it dismissed the case because it succeeded in forcing Meihao to stop selling older-model allegedly infringing products
Meihao alleges the real reason Leviton moved to dismiss its case was that it wanted to avoid a finding that the ¡¬766_patent is unenforceable
Leviton has more than 30 different issued patents and patent applications that relate to the ¡¬766_patent and Leviton 's counsel of record on the ¡¬766_patent was also counsel of record in the PTO on several hundred Leviton patents
The district_court dismissed the case with prejudice on December 17 2007 and gave Meihao leave to file a motion for fees and costs

The magistrate_judge held a hearing on the motion for fees and costs on September 3 2008 and issued a 128 page Memorandum Opinion on December 23 2008 in which she found that Leviton had committed inequitable_conduct had engaged in a strategy of vexatious_litigation and that an award of fees to Meihao was proper
District Judge Andre M. Davis issued an opinion on May_12,_2009 accepting Magistrate_Judge_Gauvey 's report and recommendations
The district_court entered two money judgments in favor of Meihao together totaling $ 1,046,353.10 in costs and reasonable attorney_fees
