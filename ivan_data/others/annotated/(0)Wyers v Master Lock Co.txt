DYK Circuit_Judge
Master_Lock Company LLC ( `` Master_Lock '' ) appeals from a final judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the District of Colorado in favor of Philip W. Wyers and Wyers_Products_Group Inc. ( collectively `` Wyers '' )
A jury found that Master_Lock failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that claims 15 19 21 and 24 of U.S. Patent No._6672,115 ( the `` ¡¬115_patent `` ) claim 1 of U.S._Patent_No._7165,426 ( the `` ¡¬426_patent `` ) and claims 1 9 and 11 of U.S._Patent_No._7225,649 ( the `` ¡¬649_patent `` or the `` seal patent '' ) would have been obvious
The district court denied Master_Lock 's renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law ( `` JMOL '' )
Wyers v. Master_Lock Co. No._06- cv-00619-LTB 2009_WL_1309774 ( D.Colo
May 8 2009 ) ( `` JMOL Order `` )
We reverse as we find that the claims in the patents-in-suit would have been obvious as a matter of law

BACKGROUND
The patents at issue in this case cover hitch_pin locks that secure trailers to cars and sport utility vehicles
A hitch_pin secures a draw bar or tow ball mount to a hitch_receiver attached to a motor vehicle
The hitch_pin passes through aligned_apertures in the trailer_hitch_receiver and draw bar in order to secure the two members together
The patents describe a barbell-shaped lock with a stop portion on one end a locking head on the other end and a shank portion which passes through the aligned_apertures of the hitch_receiver and the towball mount

The use of a lock in a trailer_hitch_receiver was well known in the art prior to the ¡¬115 and ¡¬426_patent s. Like the patented inventions U.S. Patent No._5664,445 ( the `` Chang patent '' ) discloses a lock with a lock head a shackle having a stop member a shank and a latch
The lock is shown being used as a hitch_pin lock
