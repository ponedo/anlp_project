Opinion
*1304 NEWMAN Circuit_Judge
Zoltek_Corporation seeks compensation from the United_States for use with the authorization and consent of the Departments of the Air Force and Navy of the patented_method of producing carbon_fiber_sheet_products as claimed in United_States Reissue Patent No
Re 34,162 issued January 19 1993 ( `` the ¡¬162_patent `` )
The ¡¬162_patent is a reissue of U.S. Patent No._4728,395 issued March_1,_1988 to inventor George Boyd and assigned to Mr. Boyd 's employer Stackpole Fibers Company
The patent was acquired by Zoltek_Corporation with its acquisition of Stackpole in 1988

Litigation history
On March_25,_1996 Zoltek filed suit in the United_States_Court of Federal_Claims ( CFC ) alleging that the process used to produce carbon_fiber_sheet_materials for the B-2_Bomber and the F-22_Fighter Plane infringed the ¡¬162_patent
This is the third appeal in this action
The factual background is set forth in the prior opinions of the CFC and this court

In the first appeal this court answered a certified question to hold that the patentee has no cause of action against the United_States when any step of the patented_method is practiced outside of the United_States as for the F-22_Fighter
Zoltek_Corporation v. United_States 442_F.3d_1345 1353 ( Fed.Cir.2006 ) ( Plager J. dissenting ) ( Zoltek I )

On remand the CFC granted Zoltek 's request for leave to amend its complaint to substitute as defendant Lockheed Martin the general contractor for the F-22_Fighter and then granted Zoltek 's motion to transfer the count relating to the F-22_Fighter to the United_States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia where it was `` reasonably plausible '' that the court had jurisdiction over an infringement suit against Lockheed
Zoltek_Corporation v. United_States 85_Fed.Cl._409 422 ( 2009 )
On Lockheed 's motion this aspect was certified for appeal

The Federal_Circuit then acted en banc ( in part ) and reversed its ruling in Zoltek I
This court recognized the liability of the United_States for infringement by acts that are performed with its authorization and consent
28 U.S.C.¡± 1498 ( a ) ( `` Whenever an invention described in and covered by a patent of the United_States is used or manufactured by or for the United_States without license of the owner thereof or lawful right to use or manufacture the same the owner 's remedy shall be by action against the United_States in the United_States_Court of Federal_Claims for the recovery of his reasonable and entire compensation for such use and manufacture `` )
By statute the contractor is immunized from liability
Id
( `` use or manufacture.. by a contractor.. shall be construed as use or manufacture for the United_States '' )
This court dismissed Lockheed as a party negated the proposed transfer to Georgia and remanded to the Court of Federal_Claims for inclusion of counts for infringement with respect to both the F-22_Fighter and the B-2_Bomber
Zoltek_Corporation v. United_States 672_F.3d_1309 1311 ( Fed.Cir.2012 ) ( en banc ) ( Zoltek II )

On remand the CFC separated trial of the issues of validity and infringement and denied discovery as to infringement with respect to the F-22_Fighter
Zoltek sought mandamus from this court concerning these actions ; the petition was denied
In re Zoltek_Corporation 526_Fed.Appx._956 957 ( Fed.Cir.2013 ) ( non-precedential )
Trial proceeded in the CFC limited to validity
The government challenged the ¡¬162_patent under sections 101 103 and 112 of Title 35
The CFC sustained patent eligibility under section 101 ; that ruling is not appealed

At trial each side presented an expert witness Dr. Brian Sullivan for the government and Mr. Zsolt Rumy for Zoltek
The *1305 CFC held the asserted claims invalid on the grounds of obviousness and inadequate written description
Zoltek_Corporation v. United_States No._96-166 C 2014_WL_1279152_(Fed.Cl._Mar._31,_2014) ( `` CFC Op `` )
Zoltek appeals arguing that the CFC applied incorrect laws of written description and obviousness that the CFC did not apply the appropriate burdens and standards of proof and that the CFC erred in its conclusions

Zoltek also argues that the issues were improperly bifurcated
We conclude that in the circumstances of this case taking note of the government 's official invocation of state secret privilege the CFC acted within its discretion in limiting trial initially to the issues of validity
However as we next discuss we conclude that the trial court erred in its judgment of patent invalidity
