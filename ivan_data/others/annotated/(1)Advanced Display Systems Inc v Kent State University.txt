DECISION
GAJARSA Circuit_Judge
This is an appeal from the judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of Texas entered on a jury_verdict in a consolidated declaratory_judgment and patent infringement_action relating to U.S._Patent_No._5453,863 ( the `` West_patent '' )
Advanced Display Systems Inc. ( `` ADS '' ) filed a complaint in the Northern_District of Texas seeking a declaratory_judgment of invalidity of the West_patent
Kent_State University ( `` KSU '' ) an assignee of the West_patent and licensees Kent_Research_Corporation ( `` KRC '' ) and Kent_Display_Systems Inc. ( `` KDS '' ) ( collectively `` Kent '' ) then filed an infringement_action and the two cases were consolidated with Kent as the nominal defendant and ADS as the nominal plaintiff
The parties agreed to have a magistrate_judge preside over the jury_trial
Following the two-week trial the jury found that the West_patent was invalid for anticipation and obviousness and not infringed by ADS
Kent then moved for a new_trial on all the issues in light of newly discovered evidence
Kent also moved for a new_trial on anticipation alleging an erroneous jury instruction
In addition Kent filed a motion for sanctions against ADS 's counsel for withholding evidence during discovery
The magistrate_judge denied all of these motions
On appeal we hold that prejudicial legal error tainted the jury instruction we vacate the judgment and remand for a new_trial on anticipation
We also remand for a new_trial on obviousness and infringement in light of the newly discovered evidence
Finally we reverse the magistrate_judge 's ruling on the motion for sanctions

BACKGROUND
Since 1965 scientists at KSU 's Liquid Crystal Institute ( `` LCI '' ) have been researching the various properties and applications of liquid_crystal_materials
An important area of research focused on liquid crystal displays ( `` LCDs '' )
A typical LCD consists of a sandwich of liquid_crystal_material between two glass substrates
An electrical_driver1 connects to the sandwich in order to stimulate or address the liquid_crystal_material thereby creating readable numerical or alphabetical characters
Manufacturers of electro-optic products *1276 such as digital watches and notebook computers screens use LCDs to display images and information

Traditionally LCDs were constructed by combining varying concentrations of liquid_crystal_materials and polymers
For example one method for creating LCDs involved evaporating water from an aqueous emulsion of liquid_crystal_material in a solution of water-soluble polymer
Another method involved phase separation of liquid crystal from a homogenous solution with a synthetic resin to generate a liquid crystal phase blended with a polymer phase
Those methods however were expensive and entailed complex manufacturing processes
In addition the presence of polymers created a haze effect that obstructed visibility of the displayed information when the LCDs were viewed from oblique angles

In early 1992 Dr. John West ( `` West '' ) director of LCI began experimenting with techniques for developing polymer-free_LCDs
West eventually developed a new polymer-free_LCD using cholestric visible materials.2 West determined that applying an electric field pulse of sufficient duration and voltage to cholestric visible material creates a contrast between the material 's light reflecting and light scattering textures thereby enabling a stable image display
West further found that a stable image could be sustained through a single electric field pulse rather than continuous application of an electric field
Thus through the unique use of cholestric visible materials West achieved the advantages of prior LCDs without the drawbacks attendant to the use of polymers

On May_4,_1993 West and his colleague Dr. Deng-Ke Yang filed a patent_application covering their polymer-free device and a method for stimulating it
On September 26 1995 the application matured into the West_patent
West then assigned the patent to KSU which through its licensing arm KRC subsequently licensed the patent to KDS

In February 1992 Dr. Bao Gang Wu ( `` Wu '' ) a former KSU student and colleague of West formed ADS
In June 1993 Jiamini Gao ( `` Gao '' ) ADS 's vice-president of research and development secured a written formula for Kent 's cholestric_LCD
Even with knowledge of that formula however ADS failed to develop a functional LCD device because it could not construct an effective electrical_driver

In early 1994 Dr._Zvi_Yaniv ( `` Yaniv '' ) then president of KDS and a former classmate of Wu visited ADS and demonstrated a prototype of Kent 's cholestric_LCD and its electrical_driver
Following the demonstration Yaniv went to lunch with Wu leaving the prototype at ADS 's offices
Seizing the opportunity Gao clandestinely removed the prototype from its box and brought it into an ADS laboratory
Gao then instructed a group of ADS engineers including Victor Zhou ( `` Zhou '' ) to disassemble the prototype photograph its various components and re-assemble it in such a manner as to avoid any indication of tampering
Throughout this process Gao urged his employees to work quickly to avoid detection because he knew the implication of the theft

Prior to Yaniv 's visit ADS failed to develop an operational polymer-free_LCD through its independent efforts
Equipped with the photographs of Kent 's prototype however ADS replicated Kent 's cholestric_LCD and electrical_driver within a month
On April_11,_1994 ADS also filed a patent_application for a polymer-free_LCD based on the equivalent subject matter that had been photographed and copied during the surreptitious disassembly of Kent 's prototype
The patent listed Wu Gao Zhou and Yao-Dong Ma as inventors
*1277 While ADS 's application was pending the West_patent issued and the Patent and Trademark Office Examiner rejected ADS 's claims directed exclusively to polymer-free_LCDs as anticipated by the West_patent
ADS consequently amended and limited its claims to cover the application of surface treatment in polymer-free_LCDs
The ADS application eventually matured into U.S._Patent_No._5625,477 on April_29,_1997

In early 1996 Kent learned that ADS was promoting a polymer-free_LCD and notified ADS that it intended to enforce the West_patent
While Kent and ADS were discussing licensing arrangements ADS filed a complaint in the Northern_District of Texas seeking a declaratory_judgment of invalidity of the West_patent
After settlement negotiations failed Kent sued ADS for infringement of the West_patent and the cases were consolidated in the Northern_District of Texas

Concurrent with discovery in the present_case ADS filed suit in Texas state court against USA_Display a company with several former ADS employees alleging trade secret misappropriation
ADS 's attorneys in the USA_Display_suit and in the present_case were from the same law firm
During discovery in the USA_Display_suit Zhou 's deposition was taken
The pertinent parts of the deposition are set forth below
Q : Can you describe for me or explain to me what Exhibit 3 is ?
A : This is a picture taken by an employee in ADS
I can not remember who took it but I know Dr._Zvi_Yaniv [ and Kent ] also develop a similar display they call [ theirs ] bistable display but in ADS they call multistable display
But ADS did not know how to design the driver for this device
So one day Dr._Zvi_Yaniv visited ADS with a sample and [ Kent ] have [ a ] completed driver.. And Dr._Zvi_Yaniv gave to Jianmi Gao who is the vice president of ADS and boss of R & D group so he opened Dr._Zvi_Yaniv [ 's ].. sample and took this picture while at that time Dr._Zvi_Yaniv was not there
So [ Yaniv ] did not know

.
.
.
.
.
Q : What is this picture of ?
A : This picture is the picture for the sample brought by Zvi_Yaniv

.
.
.
.
.
Q : And [ Yaniv ] gave [ the sample to ADS ] ?
A : [ H ] e not gave a sample he just waited at ADS with a sample and- Q : [ T ] hen he left ?
A : No he did not [ leave ] he showed the sample
But during [ t ] his time_period he left and [ Gao ] opened the box and took the picture

.
.
.
.
.
Q : You were there ?
A : Yeah I was there
Q : Did you open up the driver ?
A : Yes
I was an employee there
I did whatever my boss told me to do

.
.
.
.
.
Q : Where was Mr. Zvi_Yaniv [ at that time ] ?
A : Well we are taking picture and I do n't know who he was talking to but he was somewhere within the building or maybe left for lunch..
I just know that [ Gao ] want us to take the picture and we took it

.
.
.
.
.
Q : Prior to the meeting in which the Kent_State_product was taken apart and photographed at ADS.. was ADS working on a similar type of display ?
A : Yeah
They were trying to develop the similar thing
Q : You said.. that ADS was trying to but had not succeeded in making a driver for [ their LCD ] ; is that correct ?
A : Yes that 's correct

.
.
.
.
.
*1278 Q : Would you please describe the difficulties ?
A : Yeah we did not know how to drive the new display since the driving is another difficult part for design [ ing ] the whole display
We did not know how to drive it what kind of waveform.. We did not know that
Q : [ Was ] exhibit 3 [ helpful ] ?
A : Right
Exhibit 3
This is very big help
So since then we knew we start to know how to design the driver

.
.
.
.
.
Q : [ B ] efore the photograph was made
How was [ Gao ] involved in trying to make the driver ?
A : We tried [ for ] a long time-we tried to understand how to drive it but were not successful
Q : Did [ Gao know ? ]
A : He had some idea but all not successful
Q : None of his ideas were ?
A : No
We did n't even-

.
.
.
.
.
Q : [ During ] the time_period before the Kent_State_product was taken apart and photographed in the ADS lab.. [ Was ] ADS.. trying to make a driver ?
A : Right
Q : And failed
Could not do it
A : No
They did not have an idea at that time

.
.
.
.
.
Q : Why did ADS need a driver for [ its LCD ] ?
A : Without the driving circuit no one [ is ] interested in that [ LCD ]
That is just a piece of glass
You have to make the life

.
.
.
.
.
Q : Do you know when.. Mr._Gao brought you the formula for the Kent_State cholestric_material ?

.
.
.
.
.
A : Before June
Q : Before June of what ?
A : June '93
Q : Before Mr._Gao gave you the formulation had ADS succeeded in making any [ LCD ] cholestric_materials ?
A : I did not see it
Q : After he gave you what he told you to be the Kent_State formula were you successful in making cholestric [ LCD ] material ?
A : Yeah
Q : You were ?
A : After he gave me [ the Kent_State_formulation ]
Q : How long did it take you after he gave you the formulation ?
A : Few days

.
.
.
.
.
Q : All right
Now after you used the Kent_State_formulation to make the [ LCD ] your next problem was the driver ?
A : Yeah
Q : And on the day that Zvi_Yaniv visited ADS and brought the [ Kent_prototype ] module to show everybody that the photographs were made did Zvi_Yaniv know the module was being photographed ?
A : [ Gao ].. told us to be quick
Do n't let Dr._Zvi_Yaniv know..

.
.
.
.
.
Q : So after the photographs were made what happened to the [ Kent_prototype ] ?
Was it reassembled ?
A : Reassembled and the [ n ] gave [ it back to Yaniv ]
Q : How long did it take to photograph it ?
A : Pretty quick
Q : [ Gao ] told you to be quick did n't he ?
A : Yeah pretty quick

.
.
.
.
.
*1279 Q : After the Kent_State [ prototype ] was copied were you successful in making a driver ?
A : Yes
After about a month or so
Q : How did your driver compare to the Kent_State driver ?
A : We changed the microprocessor but we used the driver
The driver is the key part the most important to this

.
.
.
.
.
Q : The cholestric_material that was developed at ADS was based upon the formulas from Kent_State ?
A : Yes
Q : And the driver on the [ LCD ] at ADS was based upon the driver from Kent_State ?
A : Yeah at that time yes

.
.
.
.
.
Q : You did n't know whether Kent_State or ADS owned the technology did you ?
A : I know-technically I know the basic [ s ] are the same
Q : The basic [ s ] of the Kent_State- A : The chemistry mixture and the way they make the cell are the same
Q : As Kent_State and ADS ?
A : Right..

.
.
.
.
.
Q : Why did n't [ ADS ] just buy the functioning [ driver ].. ?
A : [ I ] t is not market available I think
We can not buy it

.
.
.
.
.
Q : Is it true that there are hundreds of shelf drivers ?
A : Thousands and thousands
Q : And so theoretically you could begin today to test and test drivers for years and not other than by accident hit the right driver ?
A : By luck you may get it in a second
If not luck it takes 10 years it takes your life
Q : So in order to find one that [ properly charged the LCD ] you either do random experimentation to find a shelf driver or invent or create a new driver ? '
A : Yeah
Q : Or use somebody else 's driver ?
A : Right

.
.
.
.
.
Q : [ N ] one of [ the drivers ] was built before ADS got this photograph ?
A : Right
Q : So the entire system that makes this was still to be done ?
A : Right
Q : And was anybody working on designing this system ?
A : [ W ] e did not know how to design.. We do n't know

.
.
.
.
.
Q : [ Dr. Wu ] told you to change things around so that he could get out-away from an earlier patent ?
A : He tried to find us a new_way to build another kind of [ polymer-free_LCD ] so we can avoid a conflict with Kent_State yes

.
.
.
.
.
Q : Why did n't you find a new_way ?
A : It is very hard.. We did not have the time we did not have the money to test everything

During this testimony ADS 's attorney attempted to terminate the deposition and telephoned the presiding judge to request a protective_order
The judge denied ADS 's request but suggested that both parties keep the deposition confidential until ADS filed a formal motion for a protective_order
ADS however never filed the motion and eventually abandoned the suit
ADS 's attorney also instructed the court reporter not to prepare a transcript of the deposition

During discovery in the present_case ADS failed to disclose to Kent the events that took place during Yaniv 's lunch with Wu in spite of various demands made upon *1280 ADS
In particular Kent served upon ADS a document request for `` [ a ] ll documents that refer or relate to any evaluation analysis examination testing performance or investigation of any light-modulating reflective device comprising [ cholestric_material ] or any compound thereof made by KDS the [ LCI ] or any third party ''
ADS 's attorneys however failed to notify Kent about Zhou 's identity or the deposition in the USA_Display_suit
ADS 's attorneys also failed to produce the photograph of Kent 's prototype instead characterizing it as `` Attorney Work Product '' in the privilege log.3

At the end of discovery all pre-trial issues regarding claim construction validity and infringement were submitted to a Special_Master who construed the claims and recommended a denial of ADS 's motion for summary judgment on the issue of anticipation
The magistrate_judge then adopted the Special_Master 's report and this case proceeded to a jury_trial

At trial both parties presented evidence and expert testimony concerning anticipation obviousness and infringement
On the issue of anticipation in particular ADS argued that the West_patent was anticipated by U.S. Patent No._4097,127 ( the `` Haas_patent '' ) and the documents incorporated by reference therein
The documents incorporated into the Haas_patent disclosed hundreds of different liquid_crystal_materials that could reflect visible and infrared light
From that body of materials ADS contended with perfect hindsight that the combination of the Haas_patent and three particular liquid_crystal_materials taught every element of the West_patent

Into the first week of trial Kent was advised by Mr. Kan Xu a former ADS employee and president of USA_Display that Zhou possessed information relevant to the case
Then more than one week into trial and without an opportunity to probe Zhou 's knowledge Kent called Zhou to testify about how ADS disassembled Kent 's prototype and photographed it
The photograph was also finally provided to Kent and admitted into evidence
At this stage however Kent still did not possess a copy of Zhou 's deposition_transcript from the USA_Display_suit

At the close of evidence Kent 's attorney did not make a motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law ( `` JMOL '' ) on either the validity or infringement issues
On the issue of anticipation the magistrate_judge instructed the jury that their role was to determine whether and to what extent_material from other documents was incorporated by reference into the Haas_patent
Kent 's attorney objected to this instruction but the magistrate_judge overruled the objection and included the instruction in his final charge to the jury
The magistrate_judge also provided the following definition of incorporation by reference : [ T ] he purpose of incorporation by reference is to make one document become part of another document by referring to the form in the latter in such a manner that it is apparent that the cited document is part of the referencing document as if it were fully set out therein

After initial deliberations the jury was unable to resolve the issues of anticipation and obviousness
The magistrate_judge however instructed the jurors to continue deliberating until they reached a verdict
Two hours later the jury determined that the West_patent was invalid for anticipation and obviousness and not infringed

Following the jury_verdict Kent 's attorney again failed to make a motion for JMOL
Rather having finally received Zhou 's deposition_transcript Kent filed a motion for a new_trial based on ( 1 ) newly discovered evidence in view of the deposition and ( 2 ) ADS 's withholding of relevant evidence during discovery
KDS also filed a motion seeking the imposition of sanctions *1281 against ADS and its attorneys for improper conduct during discovery
Regarding Kent 's motion for a new_trial the magistrate_judge found that Zhou 's deposition was merely cumulative of his testimony at trial
The magistrate_judge also determined that Kent was not prejudiced by the late disclosure of the photograph and the evidence relating to ADS 's disassembly of Kent 's prototype because Kent was able to present that evidence to the jury
As for sanctions the magistrate_judge denied KDS 's motion but remarked that he was `` deeply concerned '' with the conduct of ADS 's attorneys and indicated that he would consider further disciplinary action
