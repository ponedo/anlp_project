United States Court of Appeals Federal Circuit
ABBOTT LABORATORIES and Mitsubishi-Tokyo_Pharmaceuticals Inc. ( formerly known as Tokyo Tanabe Co. Ltd. ) Plaintiffs-Appellants v. DEY L.P. and Dey Inc. Defendants-Appellees

* Synopsis
Patentee and its exclusive licensee brought action against competitor alleging infringement of patents relating to a lung_surfactant_composition for treating respiratory_distress_syndrome in premature_babies
Competitor counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment of noninfringement and invalidity
The United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of Illinois Matthew F. Kennelly J. 2001_WL_558142 granted summary judgment of noninfringement and plaintiffs appealed
The Court of Appeals Prost Circuit_Judge held that : ( 1 ) statements made during prosecution of earlier-filed patent did not create estoppel as to scope of claims of later-filed patent ; ( 2 ) hypothetical patent claims that would cover the accused composition would not have been anticipated or obvious based on the prior_art ; ( 3 ) expert testimony did not effectively negate claim limitation as to phospholipid_content ; and ( 4 ) patent 's recitation of specific numeric ranges for chemical components did not preclude assertion of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents

Vacated and remanded

Opinion
PROST Circuit_Judge
Plaintiffs Mitsubishi-Tokyo_Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Abbott_Laboratories appeal the decision of the United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of Illinois granting defendants Dey L.P. and Dey Inc. summary judgment of noninfringement of U.S._Patent_No._4397,839 ( `` the ¡¬839_patent `` )
Because the district_court improperly precluded plaintiffs from relying on the doctrine of equivalents to prove infringement we vacate the judgment of noninfringement and remand for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion

BACKGROUND
I. Tokyo Tanabe Company Ltd. now known as Mitsubishi-Tokyo_Pharmaceuticals Inc. and its exclusive United States licensee Abbott_Laboratories ( collectively `` Abbott '' ) sued Dey L.P. and Dey Inc. ( collectively `` Dey '' ) for infringement of the ¡¬839_patent and U.S._Patent_No._4338,301 ( `` the ¡¬301_patent `` )
These patents relate to a lung_surfactant_composition for treating respiratory_distress_syndrome in premature_babies
The ¡¬301_patent filed on May_21,_1980 represents the work of Drs
Fujiwara Tanaka and Takei in developing a surfactant having the desirable properties of rapid spreading in the lungs and of reducing ultra-alveolar surface tension
Claim 1 of the ¡¬ 301 patent reads as follows : Surface active_material containing phospholipid neutral lipid total_cholesterol carbohydrate protein and water which material is obtained from lung_tissue of a mammal with or without further phospholipid characterized in that the phospholipid_content is 75.0-95.5 % the neutral lipid content is 1.8-14.0 % the total_cholesterol_content is 0.0-3.0 % the carbohydrate_content is 0.1-1.5 % the protein_content is 0.5-5.0 % and water_content is 1.7-6.0 % all based on the dried weight of said material the minimum and maximum surface tension ranges of the material estimated by Wilhelmy 's method wherein the material is added dropwise to the surface of physiological_saline in an amount of 0.3-0.8 £gg per square_centimeter of surface_area thereof being 2.1-8.6 dynes/cm and 48.2-58.0 dynes/cm when surface_areas are 21.BIG_TOKEN__0_cm_2__BIG_TOKEN and 45.BIG_TOKEN__6_cm_2__BIG_TOKEN respectively
¡¬301_patent col._17,_l._59 col._18,_l._6 ( emphasis added )

The ¡¬301_patent ed surfactant was based on a composition labeled `` TA-546 ''
Dr. Tanaka one of the three inventors of the ¡¬301_patent `` continued confirmatory studies on TA-546 '' and `` discover [ ed ] that several important properties ( i.e. surface tension-reducing capacity spreadability over a liquid surface and adsorbability to a gas-liquid interface ) of TA-546 can be enhanced by increasing the relative amount or content of free_fatty_acids to 1.0-27.7 % based on the total weight of TA-546 ''
¡¬839_patent col. 1 ll.36-44 ( emphasis added )
TA-546 contained less than 1.0 % free fatty acid although the ¡¬301_patent makes no mention of this fact
Id.at col._1,_ll._37-38 ; ¡¬301_patent col. 5 Table I. Dr. Tanaka 's *1100 discovery of the benefits of adding free_fatty_acids led him to file a new patent application on March_4,_1982 four months before the ¡¬301_patent issued on July_6,_1982
This new application issued as the ¡¬839_patent on August 9 1983
Claim 1 of the ¡¬839_patent reads : A surface active_material comprising ( 1 ) phospholipid neutral_fat total_cholesterol free_fatty_acids carbohydrate protein and water all of which are obtained from the lung_tissue of a mammal and ( 2 ) optionally at least one additional component selected from the group consisting of a phosphatidylcholine a neutral_fat and a free fatty acid characterized in that the overall phospholipid_content is 68.6 90.7 % the overall neutral_fat content is 0.3-13.0 % the total_cholesterol_content is 0.0-8.0 % the overall free fatty acid content is 1.0-27.7 % the carbohydrate_content is 0.1-2.0 % the protein_content is 0.0-3.5 % and the water_content is 2.1-5.2 % all based on the dry weight of the material the surface tension of the material as measured at 15¢X-25¢XC
by Wilhelmy 's method in which the material is added dropwise to the surface of physiological_saline in an amount of 0.3-0.8 £gg per square_centimeter of the surface_area thereof being 30.1-47.5 dynes/cm when the surface_area is 54.BIG_TOKEN__0_cm_2__BIG_TOKEN
¡¬839_patent col._17,_ll._13-31 ( emphases added )

The application for the ¡¬839_patent was filed as a separate and independent application-not as a continuation divisional or continuation-in-part of the ¡¬ 301 application even though the ¡¬301_application was pending at the time the ¡¬ 839 application was filed and the applications shared common subject matter a common inventor and the same assignee
The same examiner also examined both the ¡¬839 and ¡¬301_applications
He initially rejected the pending claims of the ¡¬301_patent as being among other things prima facie obvious in light of three prior_art articles
March_17,_1981 Examiner 's Action at p. 2
In response to this rejection the applicants argued as follows : The inventors of the invention covered by this application have studied the suggestions of these three references and discovered through experimentation that only a surface-active_material having the chemical composition claimed and disclosed at Table I at page 4 of the application under the heading `` Composition of the Material '' have the property of rapid spreading and of ultra-alveolar surface tension reduction
The results obtained are caused by the particular and novel surface-active agent isolated the method of using this agent on the ailment HMD and the method of isolating the particular surface-active_material
Accordingly it is believed all of the claims define a patentable invention over the cited references whether these references are taken separately or in combination
July_1,_1981 Amendment at pp
8-9 ( emphasis added )
After issuing a final rejection based on 35 U.S.C.¡± 112 ? ?
1_and_2 which was overcome by a September 3 1981 Amendment After Final Rejection the examiner issued a notice of allowance on December 17 1981.1

The ¡¬839_application was filed on March_4,_1982 approximately three months after the examiner allowed the claims of the ¡¬301_application but before the ¡¬ 301 patent *1101 had issued
The examiner allowed the claims of the ¡¬839_application `` because this application is an improvement over previously allowed patent claims ; and no prior_art was found which anticipates or makes obvious the instant claims ''

The ¡¬839 and ¡¬301_patent s have been involved in prior litigation before our court
In Forest Laboratories Inc. v. Abbott_Laboratories 239_F.3d_1305 57_USPQ2d_1794_(Fed.Cir.2001) this court considered whether the district_court erroneously granted Forest a judgment of noninfringement as a matter of law following a jury verdict of infringement
We affirmed the district_court 's decision because the jury 's verdict was not supported by substantial evidence
Abbott failed to present any evidence that the accused products met the water limitation of the claims either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents
Id.at 1312-13 57 USPQ2d at 1799-1800
We also stated that the above quoted argument from the ¡¬301 prosecution history was `` an unmistakable assertion made to the PTO in support of patentability..
Accordingly [ Abbott ] is estopped from asserting that the percentage of water in the surface active_material is irrelevant ''
Id.at 1314 57 USPQ2d at 1800
