BACKGROUND
In July of 1990 Jeffrey and Claudia_Griffin conceived of the idea of using a scratch-off label to mark beverage_containers and cups so that attendees of a gathering or party could keep track of their beverage cups
The Griffins filed a patent application in April 1991 and the ¡¬448_patent entitled `` Scratch-Off Marking Label '' issued on October 13 1992
Claim 1 of the patent which is representative of the four disputed claims reads as follows : 1
A scratch-off label for permitting a user to write thereon without the use of a marking implement comprising : a permanent_base having a colored near_side which is normally visible to the user and having a far side ; and
a coating of scratch-off non-transparent material having a color which contrasts with the color of the near_side of the permanent_base which coating is applied directly onto the near_side of the permanent_base with sufficient thickness so as to obscure the color of the permanent_base and which when scratched off reveals the color of the near_side of the permanent_base
¡¬448_patent col. 4_ll._35 -48
The first two lines of Claim 1 comprise its preamble
Figure 1 of the ¡¬448_patent which illustrates a beer can embodiment of the asserted invention is reproduced below
