Opinion
MICHEL Chief_Judge Pfizer_Inc. filed suit against Apotex Inc. ( formerly known as TorPharm Inc. ) in the United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of Illinois on July_30,_2003 alleging that pursuant to 21 U.S.C.¡± 355 ( j ) ( 5 ) ( B ) ( iii ) Apotex 's filing with the United_States Food and Drug Administration ( `` FDA '' ) of its Abbreviated New Drug Application ( `` ANDA '' ) No._76-719 seeking approval to commercially sell amlodipine_besylate_tablets ( 2.5 mg 5 mg and 10 mg strengths ) before the expiration of the term of U.S._Patent_No._4879,303 ( `` the ¡¬303_patent `` ) to Pfizer infringed claims 1-3 of the ¡¬303_patent
The ANDA_product sought to be approved by Apotex is a generic_version of Pfizer 's amlodipine_besylate drug product which is commercially sold in tablet_form in the United_States under the trademark NorvascTHE_R
NorvascTHE_R is approved by the FDA for treating hypertension and chronic stable and vasospastic angina
The ¡¬303_patent entitled `` Pharmaceutically Acceptable Salts '' is listed in the FDA 's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations ( `` Orange Book '' ) with respect to the NorvascTHE_R drug product in accordance with 21 U.S.C.¡± 355 ( b ) ( 1 )
Apotex certified in ANDA_No._76-719 that it believed the ¡¬303_patent was invalid and unenforceable and sought approval to market and sell its amlodipine_besylate_tablets before September 25 2007 ( i.e. the expiration date of the ¡¬303_patent plus an additional six months of pediatric exclusivity ) pursuant to 21 C.F.R.¡± 314.94 ( a ) ( 12 ) ( i ) ( A ) ( 4 )

In its answer to Pfizer 's complaint Apotex denied infringement and counterclaimed for declaratory_judgments that the claims of the ¡¬303_patent are invalid for anticipation and obviousness and that the ¡¬303_patent is unenforceable due to Pfizer 's alleged inequitable_conduct before the United_States Patent and Trademark Office ( `` USPTO '' )
Prior to trial however Apotex stipulated that its ANDA_product contains each limitation of claims 1-3 of the ¡¬303_patent and that if the ¡¬303_patent were upheld as valid and enforceable its ANDA_product would literally infringe those claims

Following a bench_trial the district_court entered a final_judgment on January 29 2006 for Pfizer and against Apotex on Apotex 's request for declaratory_judgments that the claims of the ¡¬303_patent are invalid or unenforceable
Based on the stipulation the trial court found infringement
The district_court then ordered that the effective date of any approval of Apotex 's ANDA_No._76-719 shall not be earlier than September 25 2007 and enjoined Apotex from making using offering to sell selling or importing into the United_States any product comprising amlodipine_besylate covered by ( or the use of which is covered by ) the claims of the ¡¬303_patent until September 25 2007
Pfizer_Inc. v. Apotex Inc. No._03 C 5289 ( N.D.Ill
Jan._29,_2006 )

Pfizer dismissed its claim of willful infringement against Apotex by a Stipulation and Order dated January 23 2006
Apotex now appeals from the district_court 's final_judgment challenging the rulings as to validity and enforceability
Because the district_court erred in holding that the subject matter of claims 1-3 of the ¡¬ *1353 303 patent would not have been obvious we reverse
We therefore do not address Apotex 's assertion that it had proven that Pfizer engaged in inequitable_conduct before the USPTO during prosecution of the ¡¬303_patent

BACKGROUND
A. NorvascTHE_R contains amlodipine_besylate
The active ingredient found in NorvascTHE_R is 2- [ ( 2 -aminoethoxy ) methyl ] -4- ( 2-chlorophenyl ) -3-ethoxycarbonyl-5-methoxycarbonyl-6-methyl-1,4-dihydropyridine commonly referred to as amlodipine
Amlodipine is a member of a class of compounds referred to as dihydropyridines
Active drug molecules such as amlodipine are frequently made into pharmaceutically-acceptable_acid_addition_salts to improve their bioavailability
Amlodipine besylate1 is an acid addition salt form of amlodipine formed from the reaction of amlodipine a weak base and benzene sulphonic acid

Pfizer 's Discovery_Chemistry_group located in Sandwich England invented amlodipine and discovered its anti-hypertensive and anti-ischemic pharmacological properties prior to 1982
Pfizer filed a patent_application in the United Kingdom on March_11,_1982 specifically claiming amlodipine
A U.S. counterpart application claiming priority from the U.K._application issued as U.S._Patent_No._4572,909 ( `` the ¡¬909_patent `` ) on February 25 1986.2 The ¡¬909_patent claims certain dihydropyridine compounds and their pharmaceutically-acceptable_acid_addition_salts
The ¡¬909_patent discloses that the pharmaceutically-acceptable_acid_addition_salts of amlodipine `` are those formed from acids which form non-toxic acid addition salts containing pharmaceutically acceptable anions such as hydrochloride hydrobromide sulphate phosphate or acid phosphate acetate maleate fumarate lactate tartrate citrate and gluconate salts '' and that the preferred salt is maleate.3 ¡¬909_patent col.2 ll.3-10

Meanwhile on or about July_14,_1982 the Discovery_Chemistry_group recommended that amlodipine be developed as a commercial_drug_product
By this time Pfizer had made several acid addition salts of amlodipine including the maleate fumarate salicylate hydrochloride and methane sulphonate forms
The Discovery_Chemistry_group designated amlodipine_maleate as the drug_substance for development

On or about August 11 1982 the project of formulating a commercial_drug_product was assigned to Dr. James Wells a manager in Pfizer 's Pharmaceutical_Research and Development_Department who was assisted by Mr. Edward Davison a member of the same group
By April_24,_1984 Dr._Wells identified a formulation for amlodipine_maleate that produced `` excellent capsules ''
In attempting to produce a direct compression tablet product of an amlodipine_maleate formulation however Dr._Wells encountered two problems : ( 1 ) *1354 chemical instability of the amlodipine_maleate and ( 2 ) stickiness of the tablet blend of amlodipine_maleate
Chemical stability refers to the resistance of a drug compound to chemical breakdown while stickiness refers to the adherence of the drug_substance in formulation to manufacturing equipment such as the punch faces of a tablet-making press

To solve the problems of the tablet_form of amlodipine_maleate Dr._Wells suggested that other amlodipine salts be made and tested
In a memo dated April_24,_1984 Dr._Wells acknowledged the difficulty in stickiness and stability he was experiencing in attempting to make a tablet_formulation of amlodipine_maleate and stated that by changing from the maleate salt to the free_base of amlodipine or another acid addition salt `` many of the stability problems would disappear ''
Dr._Wells identified six alternative_anions i.e. hydrochloride methane sulphonate benzene_sulphonate lactate succinate and acetate as potential anions with which to create acid addition salt forms of amlodipine
He also eventually added the tosylate anion to this group
Dr._Wells testified at trial that he selected these candidates based on their differing structures and properties but could not explain why three of the seven alternative_anions were members of the same class of sulphonic acids

Mr._Davison testified at trial that he tested these amlodipine acid addition salt forms as well as amlodipine_maleate and the free_base for solubility pH hygroscopicity and stickiness
Another researcher Dr. Robin Platt an analytical chemist at Sandwich was brought in to test the stability of the amlodipine acid addition salts
Dr._Platt subjected the maleate acetate succinate besylate mesylate and eventually the tosylate salicylate and hydrochloride salt forms of amlodipine to thin-layer chromatography to determine the number and amount of degradants found in the various amlodipine salts and compiled a ranking thereof based upon the stability of each salt formulation

Dr._Platt 's findings were communicated to Dr._Wells via memorandum on or about October 9 1984 wherein Dr._Platt reported that the besylate_salt `` showed a much improved stability profile over the maleate in all cases ''
On October 11 1984 Dr._Wells recommended via memorandum to Dr. J.R. Davidson a deputy of Pfizer 's Pharmaceutical_Research and Development_Department that the amlodipine_maleate salt be replaced with amlodipine_besylate for the commercial amlodipine tablet product based on Dr._Platt 's memo and Mr._Davison 's test results

By April_30,_1985 both amlodipine_maleate and amlodipine_besylate were undergoing human testing in clinical trials
Pfizer scientists predicted that the capsule form of amlodipine_maleate would have a shelf life of three years but that `` poor stability of amlodipine_maleate tablet_formulations '' precluded commercialization
On the other hand the scientists noted that amlodipine_besylate tablet_formulations exhibited `` clear superiority '' in their processing characteristics particularly non-stickiness and in stability
Capsule formulations of amlodipine_besylate had not yet been produced but work on this project was `` expected to be straightforward ''

On April_4,_1986 Pfizer filed a patent_application to amlodipine_besylate in the U.K. which eventually issued as U.K. Patent No._160833
On May_5,_1986 Pfizer submitted a supplement to the FDA stating that the dosage form anticipated for commercial use would be a tablet of amlodipine_besylate and that all future clinical trials with amlodipine would use this new formulation
In the supplement *1355 Pfizer stated `` We feel that the change in salt form is justified since benzenesulfonate is a commercially acceptable salt as exemplified by the tranquilizer mesoridazine ( Serentil ) ''
In support of the use of the besylate_salt form of amlodipine Pfizer submitted a summary of the acute oral toxicity of amlodipine_besylate and amlodipine_maleate in rats and a comparison of the effects of both the besylate and maleate forms on blood pressure and heart rate of dogs
Pfizer stated that the results showed that there was no quantitative difference in efficacy between equivalent doses of amlodipine_besylate_tablets or capsules and amlodipine_maleate capsules
In addition Pfizer submitted a pharmacokinetic report and interim clinical summary showing that amlodipine_besylate_tablets and amlodipine_maleate capsules were bioequivalent and had comparable safety and toleration when administered to healthy human volunteers

On March_25,_1987 Pfizer filed a U.S. application ( serial no._07 /030,658 ) to amlodipine_besylate claiming priority from the U.K._application
During prosecution the examiner initially rejected all claims of the application as obvious over the ¡¬909_patent in view of U.S._Patent 4,032,637 to Spiegel ( 1977 ) ( `` Spiegel '' ) and U.S._Patent 3,816,612 to Schmidt ( 1974 ) ( `` Schmidt '' )
The examiner noted that Schmidt discloses that aryl sulphonic acid salts which include besylate are superior to the preferred maleate of the '909_patent while Spiegel provides an example of a pharmaceutical compound wherein the besylate form is specifically identified as the preferred embodiment
In response to the rejection Pfizer argued that the besylate_salt while not the most soluble salt has many other advantages not possessed by other acid addition salts.. [ I ] n addition to having good_solubility [ the besylate_salt ] is unique in imparting to the product good stability nonhygroscopicity and good processability
For one salt to have all of these outstanding features is not suggested or taught in the art and would require extensive experimentation to find
The examiner however maintained the rejection stating that `` these qualities are basic considerations by a person skilled in the art for selecting a suitable pharmaceutical salt '' as evidenced by Berge `` Pharmaceutical Salts '' J. Pharm
Sci. 66 ( 1 ) :1-19 ( Jan.1977 ) ( `` Berge '' )
Table 1 of Berge shows 53 FDA-approved commercially marketed anions including benzene_sulphonate that are useful for making pharmaceutically-acceptable salts and lists the relative frequency of which each was used as a percentage based on the total number of anions or cations in use through 1974
Berge discloses that benzene_sulphonate had a frequency of use of 0.25 %

In response to a final obviousness rejection by the Examiner Pfizer filed a continuation_application ( serial no._07 /256,938 ) and abandoned the original application
Along with the continuation_application Pfizer submitted a preliminary amendment and statement and a declaration under 37 C.F.R.¡± 1.132 by Dr._Wells dated October 3 1988 ( `` Wells_Declaration '' )
In the statement Pfizer argued that the Wells_Declaration demonstrated that the besylate_salt of amlodipine possessed `` all the desired characteristics necessary for a medicinal agent '' and that it would not have been obvious `` that only the besylate_salt of amlodipine would have all the necessary properties for a commercial_product ''
Pfizer argued that choosing an appropriate salt is a very difficult task `` since each salt imparts unique properties to the parent compound '' and that one skilled in the art would `` conclude that the besylate_salt of amlodipine is a unique compound and not *1356 an obvious one ''
The Wells_Declaration stated that the besylate_salt of amlodipine was `` found to possess a highly desirable combination of physicochemical properties '' including good_solubility stability non-hygroscopicity and processability which properties are `` unpredictable both individually and collectively ''

The continuation_application was allowed and issued as the ¡¬303_patent on November 7 1989
The first three claims of the ¡¬303_patent are reproduced here : 1
The besylate_salt of amlodipine
2
A pharmaceutical composition comprising an anti hypertensive antiischaemic or angina-alleviating effective_amount of the besylate_salt of amlodipine as claimed in claim 1 together with a pharmaceutically-acceptable diluent or carrier
3
A tablet_formulation comprising an anti-hypertensive antiischaemic or angina-alleviating effective_amount of the besylate_salt of amlodipine as claimed in claim 1 in admixture with excipients

NorvascTHE_R was launched as a commercial_product by Pfizer in the U.S. in November 1992
