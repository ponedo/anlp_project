Opinion
LINN Circuit_Judge
Abbott_Diabetes_Care Inc. and Abbott_Laboratories ( collectively `` Abbott '' ) appeal the final decision of the U.S. District Court for the Northern_District of California which entered judgment in accordance with a jury_verdict that claims 11_and_12 of Abbott 's U.S._Patent_No._5628,890 ( `` the ¡¬ 890 patent '' ) are infringed by Becton Dickinson & Co. and Nova Biomedical Corp. ( collectively `` BD/Nova '' ) but are invalid under 35 U.S.C.¡±¡± 102 103 and 112 ?
1 and denied Abbott 's post-trial motions for judgment as a matter of law ( `` JMOL '' ) and for new_trial
Therasense Inc. v. Becton Dickinson & Co. No._04- CV-2123 ( N.D.Cal
Sept._2,_2008 )
Although judgment was entered in favor of BD/Nova on all counts relating to the ¡¬890_patent BD/Nova cross-appeals the jury 's underlying finding that it infringes claims 11_and_12
Because we conclude that the district_court did not err in denying Abbott 's post-trial motions on invalidity and because we lack jurisdiction over BD/Nova 's cross-appeal we dismiss the cross-appeal and affirm the judgment

BACKGROUND
The ¡¬890_patent is directed to electrochemical_sensors for measuring glucose_levels in blood
A droplet of blood is placed on a disposable test strip that has two electrodes : a `` working_electrode '' and a `` counter_electrode ''
The working_electrode is coated with an enzyme and a mediator
The enzyme serves as a catalyst to facilitate a chemical reaction in which the glucose_molecules in the blood sample lose some of their electrons and the mediator then transfers those electrons to the working_electrode
As the electrons flow through the working_electrode an electrical_current is detected
The magnitude of the electrical_current can then be correlated to the concentration of glucose_molecules in the blood
The electrons are then brought back into the blood through the counter_electrode
To complete this circuit the blood must be in contact with both electrodes at the same time

A problem occurs however if the blood only partially covers the working_electrode
For example if too little blood is *1329 supplied or if the test strip is not held in a horizontal position the blood may not fully cover the working_electrode resulting in the production of fewer free electrons
Because fewer electrons will flow between the two electrodes the sensor will report an erroneously low glucose level
Based on this false reading a patient may fail to take insulin when he should or the patient may consume carbohydrates when he should not

The inventors of the ¡¬890_patent sought to solve this problem known in the art as the `` short fill '' problem by placing the counter_electrode on the downstream side of the working_electrode
When the electrodes are arranged in this manner the blood necessarily makes contact with the working_electrode before it makes contact with the counter_electrode
This arrangement helps to ensure that a circuit is not completed and that no measurement is taken until the working_electrode is fully covered with blood

Claim 11 of the ¡¬890_patent is directed to this `` downstream '' embodiment
It recites with key term emphasized : 11
An electrode strip for use in an electrochemical sensor for measuring a compound in a sample comprising : an elongated electrode_support defining a sample_transfer_path for directional_flow of the sample from an application_point along said electrode_support ; a reference or counter_electrode in said sample_transfer_path ; and
a covering layer defining an enclosed space over the sample_transfer_path the reference or counter_electrode and said working_electrode said covering layer having an aperture for receiving sample into said enclosed space ; said aperture spaced away from and upstream of said electrodes in said sample_transfer_path and said reference or counter_electrode spaced downstream of said working_electrode in said sample_transfer_path
Claim 12 depends from claim 11 and adds a requirement that the counter_electrode is spaced downstream of `` any portion '' of the working_electrode

Abbott accused BD/Nova of infringing claims 11_and_12 of the ¡¬890_patent by making using and selling a product called BD ( tm ) Test Strips.1 BD/Nova denied infringement and asserted that claims 11_and_12 are invalid under ¡±¡± 102 103 and 112 ?
1
More specifically under ¡±¡± 102_and_103 BD/Nova asserted that claims 11_and_12 are anticipated or rendered obvious in light of two prior art references : U.S._Patent_No._5120,420 ( `` Nankai '' ) and U.S._Patent_No._5582,697 ( `` Ikeda '' )

Following briefing and a Markman hearing the district_court construed the contested terms in the asserted claims as follows : ( 1 ) `` sample_transfer_path '' means `` the route along which the sample moves '' ; ( 2 ) `` directional_flow '' means `` the orientation and guidance in a particular_direction '' ; ( 3 ) `` defining a sample_transfer_path for directional_flow '' means `` providing a channel for the sample to move in a particular_direction from the application_point to and including the electrodes '' ; and ( 4 ) `` aperture '' means `` an opening ''

*1330 A jury trial was held from July_15,_2008 to August 8 2008
The jury using a special verdict form found that BD/Nova infringed claims 11_and_12 under the doctrine of equivalents noting in particular that the `` aperture '' and `` electrode_support '' limitations were present in BD ( tm ) Test Strips as equivalents
The jury also found that claims 11_and_12 were invalid
More specifically the jury checked `` Yes '' in response to the question `` Have defendants proven by clear and convincing_evidence that Claims 11_and_12 of the ¡¬890_patent are invalid by reason of anticipation or obviousness ? ''
The jury also checked `` Yes '' in response to the question `` Have defendants proven by clear and convincing_evidence that Claims 11_and_12 of the ¡¬890_patent are invalid by reason of inadequate written description ? ''
In accordance with this verdict the district_court entered judgment in favor of BD/Nova and against Abbott on all counts relating to the ¡¬890_patent
On September 2 2008 the district_court denied Abbott 's post-trial motions for JMOL and for new_trial

Abbott appeals the judgment that claims 11_and_12 are invalid
BD/Nova filed a cross-appeal with regard to the jury 's finding that BD ( tm ) Test Strips infringe claims 11_and_12
BD/Nova subsequently moved this court to treat its argument in support of its cross-appeal as an alternative argument in support of affirmance
We have jurisdiction over Abbott 's appeal under 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( 2006 )
