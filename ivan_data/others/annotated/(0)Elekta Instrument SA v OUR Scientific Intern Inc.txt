No._99-1556
| June_1,_2000
| Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc Denied July_10,_2000
Synopsis
Owner of patent for gamma radiation unit brought infringement action against seller of accused device
The United_States_District_Court for the Southern_District of New_York Lawrence M. McKenna J. 51_F.Supp.2d_478 granted summary_judgment of infringement in favor of owner and seller appealed
The Court of Appeals Lourie Circuit_Judge held that patent required that radiation_sources and beam_channels be located only within zone extending between latitudes of 30¢X and 45¢X so patent was not literally infringed

LOURIE Circuit_Judge
O.U.R
Scientific International Inc. ( `` OSI '' ) appeals from the decision of the United_States_District_Court for the Southern_District of New_York denying its motion for summary_judgment of noninfringement of U.S. Patent 4,780,898 and granting the cross-motion of Elekta_Instrument_S.A. ( `` Elekta '' ) for summary_judgment of infringement
See Elekta_Instrument_S.A. v. O.U.R
Scientific Int ' l Inc. 51_F.Supp.2d_478 ( S.D.N.Y.1999 )
Because the district_court erred in concluding as a matter of law that OSI 's Rotating Gamma System ( RGS ) literally infringes claim 1 of the '898_patent we reverse

BACKGROUND
Elekta 's '898_patent is directed to medical devices known as `` gamma_units ''
Gamma_units are used for treating brain tumors through focused radiation therapy
See Elekta 51 F.Supp.2d at 479
In a typical gamma_unit multiple beams of radiation are aimed at a single focal_point on a patient 's brain
See id
At the focal_point the combined energy of the multiple radiation beams destroys abnormal brain tissue
See id
Gamma_units generally consist of several components including : ( 1 ) `` radiation_sources '' ( i.e. radioactive cobalt isotopes ) located around the outer surface of a hemispherical radiation_shield ; ( 2 ) `` beam_channels '' or narrow holes in the radiation_shield located beneath each radiation source ; ( 3 ) a `` collimator '' located inside the radiation_shield with holes that are aligned with the beam_channels ; and ( 4 ) a treatment table for moving a patient in and out of the gamma_unit
See id.at 479-80

The '898_patent claims a specific arrangement of radiation_sources and beam_channels that reduces the risk of radiation scatter outside the gamma_unit
See '898_patent col._1,_ll._38-43 ; col._3,_ll._8-9
The patent contains one independent claim and five dependent claims
Independent claim 1 is the sole claim at issue
During prosecution the examiner initially rejected claim 1 for obviousness
In response the applicant amended claim 1 to read as follows : 1
An arrangement in a gamma_unit comprising a plurality of radiation_sources mounted within a radiation_shield and having beam_channels directed radially from said radiation_sources toward a common focal_point said radiation_shield comprising a space for accommodating the head of a patient lying on a support and having an opening the radiation_sources and the beam_channels directed radially from said space toward the focal_point being located in relation to the diametrical_plane extending across the opening to said space only within a zone extending between latitudes 30¢X-45¢X > > as seen from said diametrical_plane
Id.at col._3,_ll._16-27 ( emphasis added )
The patent was accordingly granted
Figure 4 of the '898_patent depicts the arrangement as follows :

*1305. ?
According to the written description the novel aspect of this arrangement is that the radiation_sources 8 and the beam_channels 6_and_19 are located in relation to the diametrical_plane across the opening 11 to the radiation_shield 2 `` within a zone extending to latitudes 30¢X-45¢X > > from said diametrical_plane ''
Id.at col._1,_ll._44-50
In other words the radiation_sources 8 and beam_channels 6_and_19 are located `` within an annular curved zone extending maximally up to latitudes 30¢X > > -45¢X '' as seen from the diametrical or vertical plane
See id.at col._2,_ll._16-22 ; col._3,_ll._2-3 ( emphasis added )
As a result none of the radiation_sources 8 and beam_channels 6_and_19 are directed out of the gamma_unit and any radiation beams that pass through the focal_point F will impinge solely upon the radiation_shield 2
See id.at col._3,_ll._3-7

OSI offers for sale in the United States its RGS gamma_unit which has radiation_sources and beam_channels positioned at latitudes ranging from 14¢X > > to 43¢X in relation to the diametrical_plane
See Elekta 51 F.Supp.2d at 481
Elekta sued OSI for infringement of claim 1 of the patent
See id.at 479
OSI moved for summary_judgment of noninfringement of the patent and Elekta cross-moved for summary_judgment of infringement
See id
The district_court denied OSI 's motion and granted Elekta 's cross-motion after interpreting claim 1 as including gamma_units *1306 with radiation_sources and beam_channels located `` beginning at the edge of the helmet ( 0 ) and extending to a point between 30¢X-45¢X > > '' and concluding that OSI 's device literally infringes claim 1 of the '898_patent
Id.at 485
OSI now appeals to this court
We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( 1994 )
