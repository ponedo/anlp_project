Opinion
Opinion for the court filed by Circuit_Judge LINN
Opinion concurring-in-part and dissenting-in-part filed by Circuit_Judge BRYSON
LINN Circuit_Judge Apotex Inc. and Apotex_Corp. ( collectively `` Apotex '' ) appeal from the grant by the United_States_District_Court for the District of New_Jersey of a preliminary_injunction barring Apotex from launching a generic_version of a budesonide drug made and distributed under the approval of the United States Food and Drug Administration ( `` FDA '' ) by AstraZeneca LP and AstraZeneca_AB ( collectively `` AstraZeneca '' ) and covered under method and kit_claims in AstraZeneca 's U.S
Patents No._6598,603 ( `` the ¡¬603_Patent `` ) and No._6899,099 ( `` the ¡¬099_Patent `` )
AstraZeneca cross-appeals the district_court 's ruling that the asserted kit_claims in both patents are invalid
Because the district_court did not abuse its discretion by granting the preliminary_injunction and did not err in determining that the kit_claims are invalid this court affirms

BACKGROUND
I
The Drug Approval Process
In part this appeal concerns the procedures for obtaining permission to sell either a `` new '' or generic_drug under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act ch
675 52_Stat._1040_(1938) ( codified as amended in scattered sections of 21 U.S.C )
Under the Act the FDA must approve all new_drugs before such drugs may be distributed in interstate commerce
21 U.S.C.¡± 355 ( a )
To obtain approval for a new_drug an applicant may file a New Drug Application ( `` NDA '' ) that includes examples of the proposed label for the drug and clinical data demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective for use
Id.¡± 355 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( A ) ( b ) ( 1 ) ( F )
The NDA must contain the patent number and expiration date of any patent that claims either the drug or a method of using the drug if `` a claim of patent infringement could reasonably be asserted ''
Id.¡± 355 ( b ) ( 1 )
The FDA publishes the names of approved drugs and their associated patent information in the Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations list commonly referred to as the `` Orange_Book ''

An applicant seeking approval to market a generic_version of a drug may file either an Abbreviated New Drug Application ( `` ANDA '' ) or a `` 505 ( b ) ( 2 ) application '' which is also known as a `` paper_NDA ''
Id.¡± 355 ( b ) ( 2 ) ( j )
An ANDA allows an applicant to rely on the safety and efficacy information for the listed drug if the applicant can show that the generic_drug is `` bioequivalent '' to the listed drug

An ANDA has three requirements that are particularly relevant here
First the applicant must demonstrate that `` the route of administration the dosage form and the strength of the new_drug are the same as those of the listed drug '' unless the FDA has approved a `` suitability petition '' requesting permission to file an ANDA that differs from the listed drug in one or more of these respects
Id.¡± 355 ( j ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ( iii ) ( j ) ( 2 ) ( C )
Second subject to changes required by FDA regulations or a successful suitability petition the applicant must also show that `` the labeling proposed for the new_drug is the same as the labeling approved for the listed *1046 drug ''
Id.¡± 355 ( j ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ( v )
Third for each patent listed in the Orange_Book that claims either the listed drug or a use of the listed drug for which the applicant is requesting approval an ANDA must include either one of four certifications or a `` section_viii_statement ''

If an applicant chooses to submit a certification the applicant must certify `` ( I ) that.. patent information has not been filed ( II ) that such_patent has expired ( III ).. the date on which such_patent will expire or ( IV ) that such_patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture use or sale of the new_drug ''
Id.¡± 355 ( j ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ( vii ) ( I ) - ( IV )
These certifications are referred to as Paragraph I II III and IV_certifications respectively

Assuming all regulatory requirements are satisfied the FDA may immediately make effective the approval of an ANDA that includes either a Paragraph I or II certification
Id.¡± 355 ( j ) ( 5 ) ( B ) ( i )
By contrast the filing of a Paragraph III or IV_certification may delay the effective date of an ANDA approval and in the case of a Paragraph IV_certification invite a patent infringement suit
See 35 U.S.C.¡± 271 ( e ) ( 2 ) 21 U.S.C.¡± 355 ( j ) ( 5 ) ( B ) ( ii ) - ( iii )

If however an applicant is seeking approval for a method of use not claimed in a `` method of use patent '' associated with the listed drug the applicant must submit a section_viii_statement declaring that the patent does not claim such a use
21 U.S.C.¡± 355 ( j ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ( viii )
The applicant must also remove or `` carve out '' any mention of the patented_method of use from the proposed label for the generic_drug
See 21 C.F.R.¡± 314.92 ( a ) ( 1 ) ; Novo Nordisk A/S v. Caraco Pharm
Labs. Ltd. 601_F.3d_1359 1361 ( Fed.Cir.2010 ) ( `` Along with the section_viii_statement the generic manufacturer must submit a proposed label to the FDA that does not contain the patented_method of using the listed drug `` )
Unlike a Paragraph III or IV_certification the filing of a section_viii_statement will not by itself delay approval of an ANDA

Finally in contrast to an ANDA a paper_NDA must include safety and effectiveness_data
21 U.S.C.¡± 355 ( b ) ( 2 )
However a paper_NDA may rely on safety and effectiveness_data not developed by the applicant
Id
As with an ANDA a paper_NDA requires the applicant to submit either a patent certification or a statement declaring that the patent does not claim the method of use for which the applicant is seeking approval
Id.¡± 355 ( b ) ( 2 ) ( A ) - ( B )
