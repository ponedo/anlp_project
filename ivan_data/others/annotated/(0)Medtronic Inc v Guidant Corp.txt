* Synopsis
Background : Competitor brought declaratory_judgment_action against patentee manufacturer of medical_devices assignee and exclusive_licensee alleging that claims in pacemaker patent were invalid by reason of violation of rule against recapturing surrendered subject_matter
The United_States_District_Court for the District of Delaware Sue L. Robinson Chief_Judge 378_F.Supp.2d_503 determined that patent was not invalid
Competitor appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Schall Circuit_Judge held that :

independent claims of application as filed and claims that depended from them did not disclose unconditional_embodiment ;

other claims included unconditional_embodiment ;

unconditional_embodiment was not surrendered ;

unconditional_embodiment had not been surrendered through arguments made during prosecution ;

claim did not include embodiment with only one sensing_electrode ;

attorney 's statements about prior_art_patent 's single ventricular sensing_electrode were not unmistakable assertion in support of patentability that invalidated reissue patent claims covering embodiment with only one sensing_electrode ;

attorney did not clearly and unmistakably surrender unconditional_embodiment during prosecution of patent by distinguishing prior_art_patent on basis that it had electrodes in the ventricles that paced but did not sense ; and

attorney did not clearly and unmistakably surrender unconditional_embodiment during prosecution of patent by distinguishing prior_art_patent on basis that it could not selectively analyze

Affirmed

Dyk Circuit_Judge filed opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part

Opinion
SCHALL Circuit_Judge
This is a patent case
Medtronic Inc. ( `` Medtronic '' ) is a manufacturer of medical_devices
It filed a declaratory_judgment_action in the United_States_District_Court for the District of Delaware against Guidant_Corporation Guidant_Sales_Corporation Eli_Lilly & Company ( `` Eli_Lilly '' ) and Mirowski_Family_Ventures_L.L.C
In the action Medtronic alleged that claims 15-26 of U.S. Reissue Patent No._38119 ( `` the REBIG_TOKEN__¡¬119_patent__BIG_TOKEN `` ) a reissue of U.S. Patent No._4928,688 ( `` the ¡¬688_patent `` ) are invalid by reason of violation of the rule against recapturing surrendered subject_matter
The REBIG_TOKEN__¡¬119_patent__BIG_TOKEN claims a method and a pacemaker apparatus
Both relate to a `` procedure for pacing of the heart in a particular way so as to improve its contraction pattern and thereby augment the movement of blood through the heart ''
RE¡¬ 119 patent col._3,_ll._33-35
Mirowski_Family_Ventures_L.L.C
and Eli_Lilly are respectively the assignee and exclusive_licensee of the patent
Guidant_Corporation is a medical device manufacturer that was formed in 1994 when Eli_Lilly divested certain assets while Guidant_Sales_Corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary of Guidant_Corporation
For ease of reference we refer to the four defendants as `` Guidant ''

Medtronic now appeals from the final judgment of the district court following a *1365 bench trial that the REBIG_TOKEN__¡¬119_patent__BIG_TOKEN is not invalid
See Medtronic Inc. v. Guidant Corp. 378_F.Supp.2d_503 ( D.Del.2005 )
We affirm

BACKGROUND
I
A
The heart is made up of four chambers : two atria and two ventricles
Electrical stimulations ( depolarizations ) within the chambers cause contractions within the heart that result in pumping
The electrical_activity arises in the right atrium and is eventually transmitted to the ventricles
The period of time from depolarization of the atria to depolarization of the ventricles is called the `` A-V delay period ''

Dr. Morton Mower is the inventor named on the REBIG_TOKEN__¡¬119_patent__BIG_TOKEN
His invention involves a method and apparatus for treating ventricular asynchrony a condition in which a person has a defect in his or her heart ventricles
The defect causes the ventricles to contract at different times
This results in the loss of effectiveness in the pumping of blood
The method of the REBIG_TOKEN__¡¬119_patent__BIG_TOKEN works through a pacemaker device invented by Dr. Mower which either conditionally or unconditionally paces the two ventricles of the heart to cause simultaneous ventricular contractions
The `` conditional_embodiment '' of the invention requires sensing a depolarization in a first ventricle then waiting for a predetermined period of time to sense a depolarization in the second_ventricle
If no depolarization is sensed in the second_ventricle the device stimulates or `` paces '' the second_ventricle with an electrical pulse
This embodiment of the invention is called `` conditional '' because the delivery of pacing pulses depends on the analysis of the cardiac signals
In the `` unconditional_embodiment '' depolarization is sensed in either ventricle and as soon as depolarization in one ventricle is sensed both ventricles are immediately paced
In the `` unconditional_embodiment '' one ventricle will be paced twice once naturally and once by the device

In the invention 's conditional_embodiment there are two apparatuses to sense electrical_activity ( `` sensing_electrodes '' )
There is one sensing_electrode in each ventricle
In addition there is at least one pacing electrode to pace the second_ventricle
In the unconditional_embodiment there may be only one sensing_electrode as once a depolarization is sensed in one ventricle the other ventricle is immediately paced
However there are always two pacing electrodes so that both ventricles may be paced at the same time
