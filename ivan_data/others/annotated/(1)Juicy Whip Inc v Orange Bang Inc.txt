BACKGROUND
A
The Invention
The ¡¬405_patent is entitled `` Post-Mix Beverage Dispenser With an Associated Simulated Display of Beverage ''
Figure 1 of the patent depicts a beverage_dispenser embodying the claimed invention showing the countertop display bowl with its auxiliary equipment located below the counter and concealed from public view

?
As set forth in more detail in a previous appeal involving this suit a `` post-mix '' beverage_dispenser stores beverage syrup_concentrate and water in separate locations until the beverage is ready to be dispensed
See Juicy_Whip Inc. v. *732 Orange_Bang Inc. 185_F.3d_1364 1365 51_USPQ2d_1700 1701 ( Fed.Cir.1999 ) ( `` Juicy_Whip I `` )
The syrup and water are mixed together immediately before the beverage is dispensed which is usually after the consumer requests the beverage
In contrast in a `` pre-mix '' beverage_dispenser the syrup_concentrate and water are pre-mixed and the beverage is stored in a display reservoir bowl until it is ready to be dispensed
The display bowl is said to stimulate impulse buying by providing the consumer with a visual beverage display
A pre-mix display bowl however has a limited capacity and is subject to contamination by bacteria
It therefore must be refilled and cleaned frequently

The invention claimed in the ¡¬405_patent is a post-mix beverage_dispenser that is designed to look like a pre-mix beverage_dispenser
The claims require the post-mix dispenser to have a transparent bowl that is filled with a fluid that simulates the appearance of the dispensed_beverage and is resistant to bacterial growth
The claims also require that the dispenser create the visual_impression that the bowl is the principal_source of the dispensed_beverage although in fact the beverage is mixed immediately before it is dispensed as in conventional post-mix dispensers

The two claims at issue claims 6_and_9 provide : 6
A method for inducing sales of a beverage to be dispensed from the outlet of a post-mix beverage_dispenser said method comprising the steps of : positioning a transparent display bowl relative to the dispenser outlet to create the visual_impression that said bowl is the reservoir and principal_source from which a serving of the beverage is dispensed ; selecting a display fluid for said bowl which resists formation of organic_growth and simulates the appearance of the dispensed_beverage ; and
visibly storing without dispensing a quantity of said fluid in said bowl to create the visual_impression that multiple_servings of the dispensed_beverage are stored in said bowl for issuance from the outlet
9
A beverage dispensing apparatus comprising : a post-mix dispenser having a dispensing outlet for discharging beverage components in predetermined proportions to provide a serving of dispensed_beverage ; and
a transparent display container having no fluid connection with said outlet and visibly containing a quantity of fluid which simulates the appearance of said dispensed_beverage said fluid being resistant to organic_growth ; said container being positioned relative to said outlet to create the visual_impression that said container is the reservoir and principal_source of said dispensed_beverage issuing from said outlet ; and
said container and said quantity of fluid visible within said container cooperating to create the visual_impression that multiple_servings of said dispensed_beverage are stored within said container
