Opinion
MAYER Chief_Judge
Gary E. Rhine appeals the judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of Ohio Case No._96 CV7524 which granted Casio Inc. and Casio_Computer_Co. Ltd. ( collectively `` Casio '' ) summary_judgment of noninfringement
Because the court improperly construed the claim we reverse the judgment and remand the case

*1344 Background
Rhine owns U.S. Patent No._4910,652 which is directed to a wrist_watch containing a flashlight having a time_delay_circuit
The time_delay_circuit turns the flashlight off after a set period of time
The only asserted claim claim 1 recites : `` A time keeping and displaying wrist mountable watch having a flashlight mounted in the case thereof said flashlight comprising a power_supply for supplying electrical power to said flashlight said power_supply electrically connected to at least one light_source and time_delay means for automatically extinguishing said light_source after a time_delay following the energization of said light_source by the electrical deenergization of said light_source ''
Because Casio sells and/or manufactures a wrist_watch whose face illuminates with sufficient brightness to light up an area beyond the watch_face itself Rhine sued it for infringement of claim 1

Following an initial settlement conference the court ordered Rhine to file a motion to construe the claim purporting to follow the procedure suggested by Markman v. Westview Instruments Inc. 517_U.S._370 116_S.Ct._1384 134_L.Ed.2d_577_(1996)
In the statement of claim interpretation submitted to the court Rhine argued that claim 1 covers a wrist_watch having ( 1 ) a light_source capable of illuminating more than the watch_face and ( 2 ) a time-delayed extinguishment of the light_source
Rhine also explained that Casio infringes the claim so construed
In response Casio argued that the claim should be construed to cover only a wrist_watch having two separate and distinct light_sources-one that illuminates the watch_face and one that illuminates an area beyond the face
Casio also moved for summary_judgment of invalidity arguing that if claim 1 covers a watch having a single_light_source then it is invalid as obvious because the prior_art discloses ( 1 ) a watch whose face illuminator is bright enough to illuminate more than the watch_face and ( 2 ) a time_delay_circuit for face illuminators

`` Because of th [ e ] limiting prior_art '' the court construed claim 1 `` as covering a flashlight that is distinct from the light_source that illuminates the face of the watch in combination with a time_delay device that automatically extinguishes the flashlight ''
This limiting prior_art includes a Japanese_reference which discloses `` a wristwatch having an illumination lamp for lighting a time display unit and for providing illumination outside of the casing ''
In addition the Patent and Trademark Office noted during prosecution that `` both mounting search lights and flashlights on a user 's wrist and enabling users to check the time by means of watch dial illumination were known in the prior_art although not in combination ''
The court reasoned that because the Japanese_reference discloses a single illumination source capable of illuminating both the watch_face and an area surrounding the watch_face the flashlight limitation of claim 1 could not be construed to cover this type of single_light_source

The court denied Casio 's motion for summary_judgment of invalidity however because there are genuine issues of material fact about whether the claim as construed is obvious over the prior_art
Casio then filed a motion for summary_judgment of noninfringement arguing that its light_source was not distinct from the one illuminating the watch_face
Based on its claim construction and the undisputed evidence about the accused product 's design and operation the court granted Casio summary_judgment of noninfringement
This appeal followed
