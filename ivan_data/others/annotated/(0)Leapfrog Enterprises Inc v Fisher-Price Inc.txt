Opinion
LOURIE Circuit_Judge
Leapfrog Enterprises Inc. ( `` Leapfrog '' ) appeals from the order of the United_States_District_Court for the District of Delaware entering judgment of noninfringement and invalidity of claim 25 of Leapfrog 's U.S._Patent 5,813,861 ( `` the ¡¬861_patent `` ) in favor of Fisher-Price Inc. and Mattel Inc. ( collectively `` Fisher-Price '' )
We affirm

BACKGROUND
Leapfrog filed suit in October 2003 alleging that Fisher-Price 's PowerTouch product infringed claim 25 of the ¡¬861_patent
Leapfrog amended the complaint to add Mattel Inc. as a codefendant in September 2004
The ¡¬861_patent relates to a learning device to help young children read phonetically
Claim 25 reads as follows :

An interactive learning device comprising : a housing including a plurality of switches ; a sound_production_device in communication with the switches and including a processor and a memory ; at least one depiction of a sequence of letters each letter being associable with a switch ; and
a reader configured to communicate the identity of the depiction to the processor wherein selection of a depicted letter activates an associated switch to communicate with the processor causing the sound_production_device to generate a signal corresponding to a sound associated with the selected letter the sound being determined by a position of the letter in the sequence of letters
¡¬861_patent col. 10 ll.23-36

In an April_7,_2005 Order the trial_court construed a number of terms from claim 25 of the patent
The court construed the phrase `` selection of a depicted letter '' to mean `` choosing a particular depicted letter from the depicted sequence of letters by contacting or coming into proximity to that particular depicted letter ''
Leapfrog Enters. Inc. v. Fisher-Price Inc. No._03-927 ( D.Del
Apr._7,_2005 )

The accused PowerTouch_device consists of a hinged plastic housing containing electronics and a speaker that opens to lie flat
When so opened a user places a book made for use with the device in a rectangular recess in the housing
The books contain large colorful pictures that also show words associated with the objects shown in those pictures
The user may select one of multiple modes of operation
In phonics_mode when the user touches one of the words on the page the device pronounces the word then pronounces each phoneme of the word in sequence and finally pronounces the entire word again
The device relies on a grid of `` crosspoints '' located in the area underneath where the books are placed to detect the location on the page being touched by the user
The processor in the device may be programmed to associate a particular *1159 response with each crosspoint
Some of the words on the pages of the books are large enough that each letter of the word corresponds to a separate crosspoint
However the phonics_mode operates in the same manner for those words with pronunciation of the word the phonemes and the word again regardless which letter the user touches because each letter has been associated with the same response in the device 's programming

The case proceeded to trial but the jury deadlocked on May_27,_2005
The parties stipulated that the case would be submitted to the trial_court for decision based on the record and the rulings made by the court at the time the case was submitted to the jury

The trial_court issued its decision on March_30,_2006 finding claim 25 of the ¡¬861_patent not infringed and invalid as obvious
The court found that the accused PowerTouch_device could not practice the `` selection of a depicted letter '' because it only allowed selection of words rather than letters
The court thus found that the PowerTouch did not infringe claim 25
The court also concluded that claim 25 was invalid as obvious in view of the combination of U.S._Patent 3,748,748 to Bevan the Texas Instruments Super Speak & Read ( `` SSR '' ) device and the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art as represented by the testimony of Fisher-Price 's technical expert Ronald Milner

Leapfrog timely appealed
We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
