* Opinion
LINN Circuit_Judge
This is a patent infringement action concerning the pharmaceutical compound ramipril which is marketed by King_Pharmaceuticals Inc. ( `` King '' ) as a blood_pressure medication under the name_AltaceTHE_R
Lupin_Ltd. and Lupin_Pharmaceuticals Inc. ( collectively `` Lupin '' ) appeal from a final judgment of infringement entered by the United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Virginia in favor of King and Aventis_Pharma_Deutschland_GmbH ( `` Aventis '' )
Aventis_Pharma_Deutschland_GmbH v. Lupin_Ltd. No._2 :05-CV-421 2006_WL_2008962 ( E.D.Va
July 17 2006 )
The district_court concluded at summary judgment that Lupin 's filing of an Abbreviated New Drug Application ( ANDA ) for a generic version of ramipril infringed Aventis 's U.S._Patent
No._5061,722 ( `` the ¡¬722_patent `` ) under the doctrine of equivalents and concluded after a bench trial that the asserted claims of the ¡¬722_patent were not invalid.1 Lupin appeals from these decisions
Aventis cross-appeals from the district_court 's decision to dismiss its claim of willful infringement
For the reasons *1295 that follow we conclude that the subject matter of the asserted claims of the ¡¬722_patent would have been obvious
Accordingly we reverse
The cross-appeal and the remaining issues raised by the parties are deemed moot and are not addressed

I
BACKGROUND
A
The Claimed Technology
The patent at issue in this appeal is directed to the pharmaceutical compound ramipril in a formulation `` substantially free of other_isomers ''
Ramipril like many complex organic molecules is one of a family of stereoisomers
As the district_court explained in greater detail in its opinion regarding validity Aventis_Pharma_Deutschland_GmbH v. Lupin Ltd. No._2 :05-CV-421 2006_WL_2008962 ( E.D.Va
July 17 2006 ) ( `` Invalidity_Opinion `` ) an isomer of a compound is a separate compound in which each molecule contains the same constituent atoms as the first compound but with those atoms arranged differently
A stereoisomer is an isomer in which the same atoms are bonded to the same other atoms but where the configuration of those atoms in three dimensions differs
The following structural formula represents ramipril :

?
Each of the five carbon_atoms marked with an asterisk can be spatially oriented in two different ways.2 For example the dashed triangle leading from the leftmost marked carbon to a hydrogen ( `` H '' ) atom indicates that the hydrogen_atom lies below the planes of the two five-sided rings of which the carbon atom is a part
The hydrogen_atom may also lie above the planes of the rings resulting in a structure that is a stereoisomer of ramipril
Because there are five carbon_atoms that may take either of two orientations-or five `` stereocenters '' as such atoms are known-ramipril is one of 2 5 or 32 stereoisomers
There are a number of different ways of naming these stereoisomers ; one comparatively simple system used by both parties and by the district_court involves labeling each stereocenter with an `` R '' or an `` S '' depending on its configuration
Using this system all five stereocenters in ramipril are in the `` S '' configuration so it is known as an `` SSSSS '' or `` 5 ( S ) '' stereoisomer
Other stereoisomers would include RRRRR SSSSR RRSSS etc

Some of the prior art references also use the terms `` enantiomer '' and `` diastereomer ''
Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are mirror images of each other like left and right hands
Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not enantiomers

The asserted claims of the ¡¬722_patent read as follows : 1
A compound of the formula

*1296. ?
or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof wherein R 2 is hydrogen methyl ethyl or benzyl and wherein hydrogen_atoms on the ring_carbon_atoms in the 1- and 5-positions are in the cis-configuration_relative to one another the carboxyl_group on the ring_carbon_atom in the 3-position is in the endo_position relative to the bicyclic_ring_system and the chirality_centers in the chain and on the ring_carbon_atom in the 3-position all have the S-configuration said compound or salt being substantially free of other_isomers
2
A compound or salt as in claim 1 which is N- ( 1-S-carboethoxy-3-phenylpropyl ) -S-alanyl-cis endo-2-azabicyclo- [ 3.3.0 ] -octane-3-S-carboxylic acid or a salt thereof
4
A hypotensive composition for reducing blood_pressure comprising a hypotensively effective_amount of a compound or salt as in claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient therefor
5
A method for reducing blood_pressure in a patient which comprises administering to said patient a hypotensively effective_amount of a compound or salt as in claim 1
Claim 1 the only independent claim covers a small genus of compounds each of which has a different functional group at location R 2
The language of the claim `` wherein hydrogen_atoms on the ring_carbon_atoms in the 1- and 5-positions are in the cis-configuration_relative to one another the carboxyl_group on the ring_carbon_atom in the 3-position is in the endo_position relative to the bicyclic_ring_system and the chirality_centers in the chain and on the ring_carbon_atom in the 3-position all have the S-configuration '' limits claim 1 ( and thus all the other claims ) to the 5 ( S ) stereoisomer
When the R 2 functional group is ethyl the compound of claim 1 is ramipril
This is the compound claimed specifically by claim 2
B
The Development of Ramipril
Ramipril is one of a family of drugs known as `` Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme inhibitors '' or `` ACE_inhibitors ''
ACE_inhibitors inhibit a biochemical pathway that constricts blood vessels and therefore are useful for treating high_blood_pressure
The earliest ACE_inhibitors dating back to the late 1960s were based on the venom of the Brazilian Viper which was known to reduce blood_pressure
The active compound isolated from viper venom known as BPP5a has six stereocenters all of which are in the S_configuration
Synthetic ACE_inhibitors have been developed by making structural modifications to this venom and to successive generations of ACE_inhibitors
For example captopril the first synthetic ACE inhibitor consists of part of the BPP5a molecule with a sulfur atom at the end
Captopril retains two stereocenters from BPP5a both of which remain in the S_configuration

Ramipril 's immediate predecessor is an ACE inhibitor known as enalapril that was introduced by Merck in 1980
Enalapril has three stereocenters
In a published *1297 article Merck scientists explained that the all-S ( SSS ) stereoisomer of enalapril was found to have 700 times the potency of the SSR stereoisomer
A.A. Patchett et al. A New Class of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors 288_Nature_280_(Nov._20,_1980) available at J.A
15475
The Merck article taught how to separate the all-S isomer using standard chromatography techniques

Both Aventis and its competitor Schering sought to create new ACE_inhibitors based on enalapril
Soon after enalapril 's introduction Dr. Elizabeth Smith a chemist at Schering conceived of the structure of ramipril and recorded it in her laboratory_notebooks
Ramipril has the same overall structure as enalapril with one distinction : where ramipril has two linked five-sided carbon rings ( a `` 5,5 fused ring_system '' ) depicted in the chemical diagrams above on the left side of the molecule enalapril has only a single ring
The addition of the second ring gives rise to two more stereocenters than are present in enalapril ; thus ramipril has the same three stereocenters as enalapril plus two new ones that span the fused ring_system and are therefore known as `` bridgehead '' carbons for a total of five as discussed above

Based on the work of Dr._Smith Schering filed U.S._Patent Application No._06 /199,886 ( `` the ¡¬886 application '' ) on October 23 1980
Thereafter the U.S._Patent and Trademark Office ( `` PTO '' ) granted Schering Patent No._4587,258 ( `` the ¡¬258_patent '' issued May_6,_1986 ) and No._5348,944 ( `` the ¡¬944_patent '' issued Sept._20,_1994 ) both claiming priority from the ¡¬886 application via a series of continuations and continuations-in-part
The ¡¬886 application the ¡¬258_patent and the ¡¬944_patent disclose the structure of ramipril but do not describe how its stereocenters should be configured

Example 20 of the ¡¬886 application discloses a method for making ramipril and is contained in the published specification of the ¡¬944_patent
¡¬944_patent col._15,_ll._1-15
The title of Example 20 encompasses only eight of the 32 stereoisomers of ramipril but there is some suggestion in the record that in fact Example 20 would have produced only four stereoisomers in practice
Invalidity_Opinion at 22-23
The district_court described one of the experts testifying on the topic as `` somewhat credible '' and did not make any explicit findings as to which stereoisomers Example 20 would create
Id.at 23
For purposes of this appeal it is sufficient to observe that it is uncontested that Example 20 yields a mixture of several but not all stereoisomers of ramipril one of which is the 5 ( S ) form
It appears likely that in some of these stereoisomers the `` bridgehead '' carbons are in the R configuration

In February 1981 Dr._Smith synthesized a mixture of 5 ( S ) -configuration ramipril and its SSSSR_stereoisomer which mixture came to be known as SCH 31925
To make SCH 31925 Smith followed the process disclosed in Example 20 with one `` tweak '' : she used a catalytic hydrogenation step instead of the mercuric acetate oxidation step taught by Example 20
The record is unclear as to why Smith used that step but there has been no showing that Smith was attempting to select particular_stereoisomers
However the district_court found and Aventis does not dispute on appeal that SCH 31925-the product of the process as modified by Smith-contains exactly two isomers the 5 ( S ) and SSSSR_forms and was successfully produced by Dr._Smith
In both the 5 ( S ) and SSSSR_forms the two `` bridgehead '' carbons are in the S_configuration
In light of the teachings of Example 20 Dr._Smith 's written laboratory_notebooks and the test results that Dr._Smith obtained within weeks of SCH 31925 's synthesis we *1298 see no clear error in the district_court 's findings that Dr._Smith had conceived of the various stereoisomers and appreciated which of them SCH 31925 contained
See id.at 22-23 68-69
Moreover in vivo testing completed by the end of March 1981 confirmed the mixture 's therapeutic activity as well as its stereochemistry
We agree with the district_court that Dr._Smith did not separate the 5 ( S ) and SSSSR isomers and there is no evidence that she conceived of a purified formulation containing only 5 ( S ) ramipril
Id.at 69

In October 1981 Dr. Volker Teetz an Aventis chemist also synthesized ramipril
Id.at 23
On November 5 1981 Aventis filed a German precursor to the application that would become the ¡¬722_patent -in-suit
On November 3 1982 Aventis filed the first in a chain of U.S. patent applications that led to the ¡¬722_patent
In all these applications Aventis claimed the benefit of the German application
There is no dispute that Aventis is entitled to the November 5 1981 priority date

On May_6,_1986 Schering 's ¡¬258_patent issued
Shortly thereafter Schering granted Aventis a royalty-bearing license under the ¡¬258_patent
Around the same time the PTO declared Interference No._101833 between the ¡¬258_patent and a pending continuation application belonging to Aventis
The interference settled
Schering agreed to reduce Aventis 's royalty payment and to disclaim some of its patent claims
In exchange Aventis conceded priority as to the primary subject matter of the ¡¬258_patent -the structure production and therapeutic use of ramipril without specification of particular_stereoisomers
Aventis retained the right to prosecute its application as to the 5 ( S ) stereoisomer of ramipril in formulations `` substantially free of other_isomers '' which it contended ( and still contends ) represents a separately patentable invention

The dispute about patent rights having been resolved between Schering and Aventis Aventis proceeded to seek FDA approval of ramipril ( apparently in a substantially pure 5 ( S ) form )
On January 28 1991 the FDA granted approval and Aventis began to sell ramipril under the name_AltaceTHE_R
Acting as Schering 's agent Aventis sought and obtained an extension of the ¡¬258_patent 's term on the basis of the period of regulatory review by the FDA

On October 29 1991 the ¡¬722_patent issued
