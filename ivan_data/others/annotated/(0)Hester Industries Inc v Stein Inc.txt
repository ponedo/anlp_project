United States Court of Appeals Federal Circuit
HESTER INDUSTRIES INC. Plaintiff-Appellant v. STEIN INC. Defendant-Cross Appellant
Nos._97-1352 97-1353
| May_7,_1998
Synopsis
Patentee brought action for infringement of reissue_patents covering steam cookers
The United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Virginia Ellis J. 963_F.Supp._1403 granted summary_judgment for alleged infringer on grounds of invalidity
Patentee appealed and alleged infringer cross-appealed challenging district_court 's claim construction
The Court of Appeals Plager Circuit_Judge held that : ( 1 ) reissue_claims violated recapture_rule due to arguments made during patent prosecution and thus failed to satisfy reissue_statute 's `` error '' requirement ; ( 2 ) requirement that reissue_patent be `` for the invention disclosed in the original_patent '' did not require objective_intent manifested in original_patent to claim invention as claimed in reissue_patent ; and ( 3 ) challenge to claim construction was moot

Opinion
PLAGER Circuit_Judge
Hester Industries Inc. ( `` Hester '' ) appeals from a summary_judgment of invalidity entered by the United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Virginia
The district_court ruled that the reissue_patent claims asserted by Hester against Stein Inc. ( `` Stein '' ) are invalid for failing to meet the statutory `` error '' and `` original_patent '' requirements for reissue_patents set forth in 35 U.S.C.¡± 251 ?
1 ( 1994 )
Hester Indus. Inc. v. Stein Inc. 963_F.Supp._1403 ( E.D.Va.1997 )
Stein cross-appeals a pretrial oral ruling in which the district_court adopted Hester 's proposed construction of the claim_term `` high_humidity_steam ''

Because the asserted_reissue_claims impermissibly recapture subject matter surrendered by Hester through deliberate arguments repeatedly made to the Patent_Office to overcome prior_art we hold that Hester is barred from asserting `` error '' within the meaning of 35 U.S.C.¡± 251 ?
1
We accordingly affirm the summary_judgment of invalidity
Because the asserted claims are invalid we need not and do not reach the claim construction issue

BACKGROUND
At issue in this case are two reissue_patents U.S._Patent No
Re
33,510 ( the `` '510 reissue_patent '' ) and U.S._Patent No
Re
35,259 ( the `` '259 reissue_patent '' )
The two patents are reissues of the same original_patent U.S._Patent No._4582,047 ( the `` '047_patent `` or `` original_patent '' ) which they replaced pursuant to 35 U.S.C.¡± 251.2 The patents are directed to a high_humidity_steam cooker having a continuously running conveyor for cooking food items such as poultry and other_meat_products
Hester a processor of pre-cooked poultry and other_meat_products owns the patents and Charles E. Williams ( `` Williams '' ) a Hester employee is the sole named inventor
After the '259 reissue_patent ( the second reissue ) issued in 1996 Hester sued Stein a manufacturer of industrial appliances for allegedly infringing several reissue_claims in the two reissue_patents

The two reissue_patents and the original_patent have the same written description ; the patents differ only with respect to their claims
That written description describes an industrial-size steam cooker for cooking large quantities of food_products
The cooker is described as having a cooker_chamber in which a steam_atmosphere is maintained
The food_products are carried through the cooker_chamber on a conveyor_belt that runs through a spiral_path
The written description teaches that efficient_cooking is achieved without the loss of humidity flavor or appearance by maintaining a water-drop-free steam_atmosphere within the chamber at near 100¢X_C and 100 %_humidity at above atmospheric_pressure

Two separate_sources of steam one internal and one external are described for maintaining the steam_atmosphere
The internal_source of steam described is a pool of water on the floor of the cooker_chamber heated by a heating_element in the pool
The external source described is a steam_generator located outside the cooker_chamber and connected by pipes to various locations within the cooker_chamber to inject steam at those locations
The written description states that the external steam_source typically provides 25 % of *1475 the steam with the remainder provided by the internal_source
'047_patent col._3,_ll._42-45 57-59
The heating_element in the internal steam_source is controlled to maintain the desired amount of steam and pressure within the cooker_chamber
Id
col._3,_ll._59-63

The section of the written description entitled DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT describes the cooking atmosphere thus : The cooking is solely with water droplet free steam near 100¢X_C. and 100 %_humidity at a pressure above atmospheric
The high humidity atmosphere prevents losses of humidity of the product as it passes through the cooker and helps retain juices essences and flavor of the product
Also it improves the heating steam interface heat exchange at the product surface for more efficient_cooking
The higher pressure not only produces a pressure-cooker like cooking efficiency to the cooking_process but is critical in connection with the flavor and conveyor type product flow as well
Id
col._3,_ll._22-33

The original_patent contains one independent_claim claim 1 directed to a food_cooking_system
The claim specifies that the cooking_system cooks solely with steam and that the system includes two sources of steam to provide the steam_atmosphere
Characteristics of the steam_atmosphere are set forth and the cooking_system is said to include a means passing a conveyor_belt through the cooker_housing
Claim 1 with relevant text emphasized reads : A food_cooking_system cooking solely with steam foods such as fish fowl meats or produce carried through a cooker on a continuously running conveyor_belt comprising in combination a cooker_housing means passing said conveyor_belt through said housing to expose food_products within the cooker_housing only to said steam as the sole_cooking_medium and two sources of steam providing said steam to cook the food_products nozzles for releasing steam located inside said housing one comprising a steam_generator supplying supplemental steam into said housing at said nozzles located thereinside to maintain the atmosphere together with the other steam_source at near 100 %_humidity 100¢X_C. and a pressure above atmospheric and the other source of steam comprising a pool of water within said housing with heating means for boiling the water to create steam
Id
col._5,_l._59 to col._6,_l._8
For purposes here this is substantially the same form in which the claim was first filed ( as application_claim 1 ) in the application for the original_patent
Accordingly we do not distinguish between the issued claim and the application_claim but instead simply refer to claim 1

In addition to the independent_claim the original_patent contains several claims which are dependent upon claim 1
Relevant here is dependent claim 12 which specifies in pertinent_part : `` A system as defined in claim 1 wherein the conveyor_belt is passed inside said housing in a spiral_path coiling downwardly.. '' Id
col._6,_ll._59-61 ( emphasis added )
This claim stemmed from original application_claim 16 which specified that the conveyor_belt is `` passed.. in a spiral_path ''

The application for the '047_patent ( the original_patent ) was filed in 1979
The patent did not issue until 1986 nearly seven years later
Over the almost seven years in which the application was prosecuted before the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( `` Patent_Office '' ) inventor Williams through his attorney repeatedly emphasized the `` solely with steam '' and `` two sources of steam '' features of the claimed invention in attempting to establish patentability over the prior_art
For example after the Examiner first rejected claim 1 as well as all the other claims as obvious Office_Action of Feb._6,_1980 at 2 Williams distinguished a cited prior_art cooker that cooked with a combination of infra-red dry heat and steam on the ground that the claimed invention cooked solely with steam stating : `` This principle is completely different from applicant 's invention where the claims define cooking solely with steam ''
Applicant_Response of Apr._28,_1980 ( emphasis in original )
Williams also distinguished claim 1 on the basis of the `` two sources of steam '' limitation the specified characteristics of the steam_atmosphere and *1476 the recited continuously running conveyor_belt
Id

Application claim 16 which specified a spiral_conveyance_path was rejected as obvious in view of an additional prior_art cooker that included a spiral conveyor
Office_Action of Feb._6,_1980 at 4
In response Williams amended claim 16 to specify further details of the spiral_conveyance_path and then argued that the claimed spiral_conveyance_path was distinguished from that shown in the prior_art
Applicant_Response of Apr._28,_1980

However the Examiner continued to reject all claims as obvious
Office_Action of July_9,_1980
At that point Williams placed even greater reliance on the `` solely with steam '' and `` two sources of steam '' limitations in an attempt to overcome the obviousness_rejection
For example in his first appeal of the obviousness_rejection to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences ( `` Board '' ) Williams stated `` The claimed system cooks solely with steam.. by means of two separate and critical steam_sources.. '' Applicant_Brief on Appeal at 2 ( Aug._20,_1980 ) ( emphasis in original )
Later in the same brief Williams specifically distinguished the cited prior_art on the basis of these limitations : The primary reference Vischer cooks with IR radiation not steam
Clearly the claimed feature of cooking solely with steam is directly contrary to the teaching of the Vischer patent which could therefore never make obvious any process or equipment cooking solely with steam as claimed
...
The Examiner errs in any implication that Jourdan shows two sources of steam
Id.at 9-10 ( emphasis in original )

Prior to the Board hearing Williams ' appeal the Examiner reopened prosecution on the merits in view of newly discovered prior_art thereby removing the appeal from the Board.3 Office_Action of Mar._17,_1981
The Examiner then rejected all of the claims as obvious over the new prior_art
Id
In response Williams distinguished claim 1 over that prior_art on the same bases i.e. the `` solely with steam '' and `` two sources of steam '' limitations
Applicant_Response to Office_Action ( Apr._17,_1981 )
However the Examiner was not persuaded even after these same_arguments were repeated in subsequent papers submitted to the Patent_Office

Accordingly Williams initiated a second appeal to the Board
He again emphasized the `` solely with steam '' and `` two sources of steam '' limitations
Applicant_Brief on Appeal at 13 ( Dec._22,_1981 )
He explained that the two sources of steam interact to provide a `` synergy '' that is `` novel and nowhere suggested in any of the cited [ prior ] art ''
Id
Williams drove home his reliance on the `` solely with steam '' limitation most forcefully in his reply brief to the Board : `` Clearly the Examiner reversibly errs as a matter of fact and in his efforts to make a case out against the very material claimed feature that steam is the sole_cooking_medium ( claim 1 )
Thus reversal is respectfully solicited ''
Applicant Reply Brief on Appeal at 6 ( Sep. 30 1982 ) ( emphasis in original )

The Board was persuaded and accordingly reversed the obviousness_rejection in its opinion dated June_21,_1985 stating : [ W ] e find no suggestion in the combined teachings of the references which would have led the ordinarily skilled worker in the art to an apparatus utilizing steam as the sole_cooking_medium ; utilizing two separate_sources of steam one of which includes a pool of water in the cooking_chamber with means for boiling the water ; and wherein the atmosphere within the cooking_chamber is maintained above atmospheric by the two sources of steam
Thereafter the claims were allowed and the application issued as the '047_patent on April_15,_1986

On the two-year anniversary of the '047_patent 's issuance Williams applied for a reissue pursuant to 35 U.S.C.¡± 251 alleging that the patent claims had been drawn too narrowly due to attorney error
In the required oath accompanying the reissue application Williams explained that he became *1477 aware of this alleged error after learning that Stein was in the process of developing a competing cooker in early 1988
According to his oath Williams and his employer Hester concluded that the '047_patent should cover the Stein cooker notwithstanding the fact that the cooker used a non-steam heat source and only one source of steam in the cooking_process
Williams further explained that Hester 's present counsel advised Hester that the '047_patent claims as written might not cover Stein 's cooker
Thus Williams by oath declared that the patent was insufficient because it claimed less than he had a right to claim

Specifically Williams identified two relevant deficiencies of the '047_patent as follows ( indentation and numbering added ) :4

[ 1 ] that each of claims 1-14 therein requires cooking `` solely with steam '' and exposing food_products within the cooker_housing `` only to said steam as the sole_cooking_medium ''.. [ and ] [ 2 ] that each of claims 1-14 therein requires `` two sources of steam providing said steam to cook the food_products nozzles for releasing steam located inside said housing '' [ ]
These deficiencies according to Williams `` arose after [ he ] executed and filed the original application from which the '047_patent issued '' and were caused by `` the failure of [ his prior ] patent attorney.. to appreciate the full_scope of [ his ] invention ''
This application ripened into the '510 reissue_patent nearly three years later on January 1 1991
However prior to its issuance Williams filed a second_reissue_application for reasons not relevant here on June_21,_1990 alleging the same errors used to support the first reissue
Six years later this second_reissue_application issued as the '259 reissue_patent
Hester then filed this action accusing Stein of infringing two claims in the first reissue_patent and six claims in the second
Specifically Hester accused Stein of infringing reissue_claims 26_and_59 of the '510 reissue_patent and reissue_claims 28 30 31 32 75 and 76 of the '259 reissue_patent

The requirement in original_claim 1 that cooking is `` solely with steam '' is absent from each of the asserted_reissue_claims
Also absent is the `` two sources of steam '' limitation
Rather the asserted_reissue_claims merely recite a source of steam or at least one source of steam
None of the asserted_reissue_claims explicitly recite the steam_atmosphere characteristics specified in original_claim 1 i.e. the characteristics of near 100¢X_C and 100 %_humidity at above atmospheric_pressure
Instead all but one of the asserted_reissue_claims recite `` high_humidity_steam
`` 5

Claim 26 of the '510 reissue_patent is representative of the two asserted_reissue_claims in that patent
It provides in pertinent_part : A food_cooking_system for cooking food_products carried on a moving conveyor_belt comprising : a cooker_housing [ ] means disposed within said housing for defining a conveyance_path a conveyor_belt disposed along said conveyance_path for supporting and conveying said food_products along said path means coupled to said belt for causing said belt and said food_products supported thereby to substantially continually translate along said conveyance_path.. and
a source of steam providing steam to contact and cook the food_products said steam_source comprising at least one of the following : an external steam_generator supplying steam into said housing and
a pool of water within said housing with heating means communicating with said pool of water for creating steam.. [ ] *1478 wherein said steam_source provides high_humidity_steam and said food_products are directly exposed to said high_humidity_steam
'510_patent col._8,_ll._8-31 36-38 ( emphasis added and text of claim 24 upon which claim 26 depends incorporated )

The asserted_reissue_claims of the '259 reissue_patent are for purposes here substantially similar
One difference is that several of these claims explicitly recite a `` spiral_conveyance_path ''
Claim 28 which is representative provides in pertinent_part : A spiral steam cooker for at least partially cooking exposed food_products said cooker comprising : a housing defining an internal_volume therein ; a conveyor_belt at least partially disposed along a spiral_conveyance_path within said internal_volume.. ; and
a steam_source operatively coupled to said housing said steam_source providing a high_humidity_steam_atmosphere within said internal_volume said high_humidity_steam_atmosphere directly contacting and at least partially cooking the exposed food_products.. '259_patent col._9,_l._61 to col._10,_l._12 ( emphasis added )

Before the district_court Stein moved for summary_judgment that the asserted_reissue_claims are invalid for failing to meet the requirements of the reissue_statute 35 U.S.C.¡± 251
That section ( with emphasis added ) reads : Whenever any patent is through error without any deceptive intention deemed wholly or partly inoperative or invalid by reason of a defective specification or drawing or by reason of the patentee claiming more or less than he had a right to claim in the patent the Commissioner shall on the surrender of such patent and the payment of the fee required by law reissue the patent for the invention disclosed in the original_patent and in accordance with a new and amended application for the unexpired part of the term of the original_patent
No new matter shall be introduced into the application for reissue

In particular Stein argued that the `` error '' requirement of ¡± 251 ?
1 as well as the requirement therein that the reissue_claims be `` for the invention disclosed in the original_patent '' ( the `` original_patent '' requirement ) were not met
With regard to the `` error '' requirement Stein argued that Williams had not erred in including the `` solely with steam '' and `` two sources of steam '' limitations in the original_claims and further argued that the removal of those limitations violated the `` recapture '' rule
Stein further argued that the asserted_reissue_claims violated the `` original_patent '' requirement because Stein asserted the original_patent does not evidence an `` objective '' intent to claim the invention in the manner of the asserted_reissue_claims

The district_court granted Stein 's motion
The court first concluded that there was no `` error '' as contemplated by ¡± 251 ?
1
Specifically the court concluded that the alleged failure of counsel to appreciate the scope of the invention was belied by the clear language in the original_patent claims the prosecution_history of the patent and the absence of any explanation as to the nature or cause of the attorney 's failure to appreciate the full_scope of the invention
Hester 963 F.Supp.at 1408
The court did not reach Stein 's assertion that the asserted_reissue_claims violate the recapture_rule though the court relied heavily on the original_patent 's prosecution_history in determining that the `` error '' requirement was not met
See id.at 1409-11

The district_court ruled that the asserted_reissue_claims are alternatively invalid for failing to meet the `` original_patent '' requirement
Id.at 1412
The district_court concluded that the `` original_patent '' clause of ¡± 251 ?
1 includes a separate_requirement that the original_patent manifest an `` objective '' intent to claim the invention as later claimed on reissue
Id.at 1412-13 The court concluded that the original_patent does not manifest such an objective_intent and thus the claims are also invalid under the `` original_patent '' clause of ¡± 251 ?
1
Id.at 1412-15

In its appeal of the invalidity judgment Hester argues that the district_court erred in concluding that the `` error '' and `` original_patent '' requirements of ¡± 251 ?
1 were not met
*1479 Stein in seeking to uphold the judgment makes the same_arguments presented to the district_court in its motion for summary_judgment
Hester on the other hand argues that the `` error '' requirement was met by way of prior patent counsel 's failure to appreciate the full_scope of the invention
Hester further asserts that the recapture_rule is inapplicable because the reissue_claims were never presented during prosecution of the original_patent and later abandoned by amendment or cancellation
With regard to the `` original_patent '' clause of ¡± 251 ?
1 Hester submits that there is no separate_requirement of a manifestation of an objective_intent to claim

Also at issue on appeal is the district_court 's resolution of a `` Motion For Claim Interpretation '' brought by Stein
In that motion Stein argued that the claim_term `` high_humidity_steam '' should be construed in accordance with the only specific description of the steam_atmosphere provided in the patents i.e. as water-droplet-free steam near 100¢X_C and 100 %_humidity at above atmospheric_pressure
Hester relying on the opinion of its expert proposed a broader construction arguing that the description contained in the patents is merely one example of `` high_humidity_steam ''
The district_court in a ruling delivered from the bench prior to holding the asserted_reissue_claims invalid adopted Hester 's proposed construction of the claim_term
The ruling was never reduced to a formal order or judgment
The parties by way of cross-appeal by Stein present the same issue on appeal
