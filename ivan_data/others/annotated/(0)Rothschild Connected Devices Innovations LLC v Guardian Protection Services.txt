Appellant ADS Security L.P. ( `` ADS '' ) appeals the opinion and order of the U.S. District_Court for the Eastern_District of Texas ( `` District_Court '' ) denying ADS 's request for attorney_fees pursuant to 35 U.S.C.¡± 285 ( 2012 )
See Rothschild Connected Devices Innovations LLC v. Guardian Prot
Servs. Inc. No._2 :15-cv-01431-JRG-RSP 2016_WL_3883549 at *4 ( E.D
Tex
July_18,_2016 )
The District_Court found that Appellee Rothschild Connected Devices Innovations LLC ( `` Rothschild '' ) had not engaged in conduct sufficient to make the litigation `` exceptional '' such that ADS did not merit attorney_fees pursuant to ¡± 285
See id.at *1-3

ADS appeals the District_Court 's exceptional case determination
We possess subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( 2012 )
We reverse and remand

BACKGROUND
The instant dispute arises as a consequence of Rothschild 's allegation that ADS 's home security system infringes U.S. Patent No._8788,090 ( `` the '090_patent `` )
The '090_patent generally recites `` [ a ] system and method for creating a personalized_consumer_product '' '090_patent Abstract where the system and method `` enable a user to customize products containing solids and fluids by allowing a server on the global computer network e.g. the Internet to instruct the hardware mixing the solids and fluids of the user 's preferences for the final mix '' id
col. 1_ll._58 -62
Rothschild has filed numerous lawsuits against various parties alleging infringement of the '090_patent
J.A
1086 1097

Rothschild filed a complaint against ADS alleging infringement of claim 1 of the '090_patent
J.A
62 73
ADS responded by filing an answer and counterclaims
J.A
84-92
ADS subsequently sent an email to Rothschild alleging that the '090_patent covers patent-ineligible_subject_matter under 35 U.S.C.¡± 1011 and that prior_art anticipates claim 1 of the '090_patent under 35 U.S.C.¡± 102 ( a ) ( 1 )2 J.A
*1386 704
ADS offered to settle the case if Rothschild paid ADS $ 43,330 for attorney_fees and costs
J.A
704
Rothschild rejected ADS 's offer
J.A
855

ADS next filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings arguing that claim 1 of the '090_patent covers patent-ineligible_subject_matter under ¡± 101
J.A
93-104
ADS also sent Rothschild a notice pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 ( c ) ( 2 ) ( `` Safe_Harbor_Notice '' )3 which included copies of a proposed Rule 11 ( b ) motion for sanctions and prior_art that purportedly anticipates claim 1
J.A
270 685
In light of the Safe_Harbor_Notice Rothschild voluntarily moved to dismiss its action
See J.A
247
ADS opposed and filed a cross-motion for attorney_fees pursuant to ¡± 285,4 see J.A
249 based on its view that Rothschild 's suit was objectively unreasonable because Rothschild knew or should have known that claim 1 covers patent-ineligible_subject_matter under ¡± 101 and is anticipated by prior_art under ¡± 102 ( a ) ( 1 ) see J.A
261-64
ADS also argued that Rothschild did not intend to test the merits of its claim and instead filed this and over fifty other lawsuits in the District_Court to `` 'exploit [ ] the high cost to defend complex litigation to extract nuisance value settlements ' `` from various defendants
J.A
265 ( brackets omitted ) ( quoting Eon-Net LP v. Flagstar Bancorp 653_F.3d_1314 1327 ( Fed
Cir
2011 ) )

The District_Court ultimately granted Rothschild 's Motion to Dismiss and denied ADS 's Cross-Motion for attorney_fees
Rothschild 2016_WL_3883549 at *4
As to the latter the District_Court found that Rothschild did not engage in conduct sufficient to make the action `` exceptional '' under ¡± 285
Id
The District_Court found that Rothschild 's `` decision to voluntarily withdraw its [ C ] omplaint within the safe harbor period is the type of reasonable conduct Rule 11 is designed to encourage ''
Id.at *2
The District_Court also found that Rothschild recited `` non-conclusory and facially plausible arguments supporting patent eligibility '' under ¡± 101
Id
Turning to the anticipation allegations the District_Court found that ADS neither filed a motion seeking to invalidate claim 1 of the '090_patent under ¡± 102 ( a ) ( 1 ) nor demonstrated that Rothschild failed to conduct a reasonable pre-suit investigation of the prior_art
Id
Finally the District_Court held that Rothschild 's numerous other suits for infringement pending against other companies did not alone make the case exceptional
Id.at *3
This appeal followed
