Opinion
PROST Circuit_Judge
Wal-Mart_Stores Inc. ( `` Wal-Mart '' ) appeals the decision of the United_States_District_Court for the District of Colorado after a bench trial entering a final judgment against Wal-Mart for infringement of United States Patent No._5673,989 ( `` the ¡¬989_patent `` ) owned by Golight Inc. ( `` Golight '' )
Golight Inc. v. Wal-Mart_Stores Inc. 216_F.Supp.2d_1175 ( D.Colo.2002 )

Because we find no errors of law by the district_court or any clearly erroneous findings of fact we affirm

BACKGROUND
The ¡¬989_patent is for a wireless remote-controlled portable_search_light invented by Gerald Gohl and Al Gebhardt
The idea for this invention originated from Gohl 's experiences cattle ranching in Nebraska where he used hand-held search_lights to locate and assist calving animals in harsh blizzard conditions
Gohl determined that it would be advantageous under such conditions to have a portable_search_light that could be mounted on the outside of a vehicle and remotely controlled from either inside or outside the vehicle
Together Gohl and Gebhardt developed and patented the Golight which is generally the subject of U.S. Patent No._5490,046 ( `` the ¡¬046_patent `` ) and then the wireless remote-controlled Radio_Ray which is generally the subject of the ¡¬989_patent

In 1997 Wal-Mart through its Sam 's Club stores began selling a portable wireless remote-controlled search_light
This search_light was allegedly a low-end copy of the Radio_Ray being virtually identical in all relevant respects but for the `` apparently arbitrary and rather suspicious placement of a plastic 'stop ' piece which prevented '' the search_light from rotating through 360¢X
Id.at 1180
This stop piece restricted the Wal-Mart search_light to rotating somewhere between 340¢X and 351¢X
Counsel for Golight sent Wal-Mart a cease and desist letter on December 11 1998 indicating Golight 's belief that Wal-Mart 's device infringed the ¡¬989_patent
Golight then filed this lawsuit on February 14 2000
After holding a three-day bench trial the district_court found that Wal-Mart infringed claim 11 of the ¡¬989_patent by importing portable_search_lights literally meeting each limitation of the claim the claim was not invalid Wal-Mart 's infringement was willful and Golight was entitled to damages of $ 464,280 plus its attorney_fees

On appeal Wal-Mart challenges the district_court 's claim_construction and argues that it is entitled to judgment of noninfringement should we adopt its proposed claim_construction
Should we affirm the district_court 's claim_construction Wal-Mart concedes infringement but argues that the district_court should have found claim 11 invalid as obvious
Wal-Mart also challenges the district_court 's ruling that any infringement was willful arguing that such a finding is based on clearly erroneous facts and was an abuse of the district_court 's discretion
With respect to *1330 damages Wal-Mart argues that the district_court 's selected royalty rate is unreasonable as a matter of law and is based on factual findings that are clearly erroneous

We have jurisdiction to consider Wal-Mart 's appeal under 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
