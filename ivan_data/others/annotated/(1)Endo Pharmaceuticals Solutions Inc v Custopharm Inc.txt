Opinion
Chen Circuit_Judge
Endo Pharmaceuticals Solutions Inc. ( Endo ) holds the approved New Drug Application for AveedTHE_R a testosterone undecanoate ( TU ) intramuscular_injection
Bayer Intellectual Property GmbH and Bayer_Pharma_AG ( Bayer ) own the two patents listed in the Orange Book for AveedTHE_R U.S. Patent Nos._7718,640 ( the '640_patent ) and 8,338,395 ( the '395_patent )
Custopharm Inc. 's ( Custopharm ) predecessor-in-interest Paddock Laboratories LLC submitted an Abbreviated_New_Drug_Application ( ANDA ) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) for approval to produce and market a generic version of AveedTHE_R
In connection with the ANDA filing Custopharm made a Paragraph IV certification and gave notice of the certification to Endo and Bayer on October 8 2014
On November 20 2014 Endo and Bayer brought an action alleging infringement of the '640 and '395_patent s. During the proceedings Custopharm stipulated to infringement and Endo and Bayer limited their asserted claims to claim 2 of the '640_patent and claim 18 of the '395_patent
After a four-day bench_trial on invalidity the district_court concluded that Custopharm had not proven that the claims were invalid under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103
Custopharm appealed
For the reasons below we find no reversible errors in the district_court 's conclusion and accordingly we affirm

BACKGROUND
AveedTHE_R is a long-acting injectable testosterone replacement therapy for men suffering from physiologically low levels of testosterone also known as hypogonadism
Before the 2003 priority_date for the invention claimed in the '640 and '395_patent s then-existing testosterone replacement therapies had three significant shortcomings
First the existing injectable therapies required patients to visit their doctors *1377 every two or three weeks to receive intramuscular_injections and the available topical therapies required daily application
Second the available therapies required the prescribing doctor to adjust the dosage or intervals of administration for each patient which required doctors to frequently monitor their patients ' testosterone_levels
Third the pre-2003 therapies did not provide stable testosterone_levels leading to periods of low testosterone between treatments
Patients would experience elevated testosterone_levels immediately after an injection but testosterone_levels would fall to below the normal physiological range before the next injection

AveedTHE_R 's patented formulation addressed some of these shortcomings : ( 1 ) after the initial two injections AveedTHE_R is only administered five times a year ; ( 2 ) it is a treatment that works for nearly all men suffering from hypogonadism thus obviating the need for doctors to personalize testosterone replacement therapy ; and ( 3 ) patients on AveedTHE_R avoided the fluctuations in testosterone_levels associated with other injectable products on the market before 2003
Claim 2 of the '640_patent and claim 18 of the '395_patent cover AveedTHE_R 's formulation and injection regimen
Both patents entitled `` Methods and Pharmaceutical Compositions for Reliable Achievement of Acceptable Serum Testosterone Levels '' issued from the same parent application and share a common specification

Claim 2 of the '640_patent covers a 750 mg_dosage of TU in the composition described in claim 1 : A composition formulated for intramuscular_injection in a form for single_injection according to claim 1 which contains 750 mg testosterone undecanoate
'640_patent col._13,_ll._29-31 ( emphasis added )
Claim 1 reads : A composition formulated for intramuscular_injection in a form for single_injection which contains 250 mg/ml testosterone undecanoate in a vehicle containing a mixture of castor_oil and benzyl benzoate wherein the vehicle contains castor_oil in a concentration of 40_to_42 vol %
Id.at col._13,_ll._24-28 ( emphases added )

Claim 18 of the '395_patent covers a 750 mg_dosage of TU in the composition and method described by claim 14 : The method of claim 14 in which each dose contains 750 mg of TU
'395_patent col._16,_ll._1-2 ( emphasis added )
Claim 14 reads : A method of treating a disease or symptom associated with deficient endogenous levels of testosterone in a man comprising administering by intramuscular_injection a composition comprising testosterone undecanoate ( TU ) and a vehicle consisting essentially of castor_oil and a co-solvent the castor_oil being present in the vehicle at a concentration of 42 percent or less by volume the method further comprising : ( i ) an initial phase comprising 2 initial intramuscular_injections of a dose of TU at an interval of 4 weeks between injections each dose including 500 mg to 1000 mg of TU followed by ( ii ) a maintenance phase comprising subsequent intramuscular_injections of a dose of TU at an interval of 10 weeks between injections each dose including 500 mg to 1000 mg of TU
Id.at col._15,_ll._17-31 ( emphases added )
The key elements of both claims in dispute are : ( 1 ) 750 mg TU ( 2 ) vehicle consisting of castor_oil and a co-solvent ( benzyl-benzoate in the '640_patent ) where the castor_oil is 42 % or less by volume and ( 3 ) an injection schedule comprising two initial injections at an interval of four weeks followed *1378 by injections at ten week intervals ( '395_patent only )

Bayer and Endo sued Custopharm for infringement of the '640 and '395_patent s on November 20 2014
The case proceeded to a bench_trial on the sole issues of whether claim 2 of the '640_patent and claim 18 of the '395_patent would have been obvious to a skilled_artisan in view of the prior_art which consisted primarily of three scientific articles : Behre,1 Nieschlag,2 and von Eckardstein3 ( Articles )
These Articles describe small clinical studies involving 1000 mg TU injections
The Articles report using a composition of 250 mg/ml TU in castor_oil
The parties agree that the Articles do not disclose or describe the use of a co-solvent
While the actual formulation of the vehicle used in the studies was 40 %_castor_oil and 60 %_benzyl benzoate this was not reported and thus unknown to a skilled_artisan until 2007 years after the 2003 priority_date for the patents-in-suit
In 2007 Saad4 disclosed that the vehicle formulation used in the Articles was 40 %_castor_oil and 60 %_benzyl benzoate also sold as NebidoTHE_R a 1000 mg TU injection later marketed in Europe by Bayer

In addition to the Articles Custopharm introduced Pushpalatha5 and Riffkin6 as prior_art
Pushpalatha is an article that describes the effects of a commercially marketed product-Proluton Depot ( Proluton )
Proluton is an injectable composition of hydroxyprogesterone in a mixture of 40 %_castor_oil and 60 %_benzyl benzoate
It is administered once a week to pregnant women to prevent miscarriage
Riffkin is an article that describes the use of castor_oil for the parenteral administration of steroids
It discloses a castor_oil and benzyl benzoate vehicle to improve the solvent abilities of castor_oil

After a four-day trial the district_court found that Custopharm had not met its burden of proving that the disputed claims would have been obvious
Specifically the district_court found that the prior_art did not disclose the 750 mg TU injection dosage and that Custopharm had not shown by clear and convincing evidence that a skilled_artisan would have been motivated to lower the dosage of TU from 1000 mg to 750 mg due to concerns patients were being overdosed
Further the district_court found that the Articles do not inherently *1379 disclose benzyl benzoate as a co-solvent or the particular ratio of solvent to co-solvent claimed by the patents-in-suit simply because this formulation was what had been used in the studies forming the basis of the Articles
Citing Par Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. TWI Pharmaceutical Inc. 773_F.3d_1186 1194-95 ( Fed
Cir
2014 ) and Continental Can Co. USA v. Monsanto Co. 948_F.2d_1264 1268-69 ( Fed
Cir
1991 ) the district_court noted that inherency may only supply a missing claim limitation if the limitation at issue is the `` natural result '' of the combination of prior_art elements or a `` necessarily present '' limitation
Custopharm the district_court reasoned failed to establish that alternative vehicles could not have been used in the Articles
Finally the district_court found that the prior_art did not disclose the specific injection schedule claimed in the '395_patent and was unpersuaded by Custopharm 's argument that it would have been obvious to a skilled_artisan to arrive at this specific schedule

Custopharm appealed
We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
