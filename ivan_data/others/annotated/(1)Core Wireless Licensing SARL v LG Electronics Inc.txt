2016-2684
| 2017-1922
| Decided : January 25 2018
Synopsis
Background : Patentee brought action against competitor alleging infringement of patents disclosing improved display interfaces particularly for electronic_devices with small_screens like mobile_telephones
The United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Texas Nos._2 :14-cv-00911-JRG-RSP 2:14-cv-00912-JRG-SP J. Rodney Gilstrap J. 2016_WL_1106438 denied summary_judgment that claims of patents were directed to patent_ineligible_subject_matter and denied judgment as matter of law that claims were not infringed 2016_WL_4440255 after jury found all asserted claims infringed and not invalid
Competitor appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Moore Circuit_Judge held that :

claims in patents were not directed to abstract_idea of index ;

reasonable_jury could have concluded that claims in patents on improved user interface for computing_devices were not anticipated by prior art ;

term `` un-launched state '' meant `` not displayed '' ;

patentee did not clearly and unmistakably disclaim or limit construction of `` unlaunched_state '' during prosecution ;

substantial evidence supported jury 's verdict of infringement

Affirmed

Wallach Circuit_Judge filed opinion concurring-in-part and dissenting-in-part

*1359 LG Electronics Inc. ( `` LG '' ) appeals the United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Texas ' decisions ( 1 ) denying summary_judgment that claims 8_and_9 of U.S._Patent_No._8713,476 ( `` '476_patent `` ) and claims 11_and_13 of U.S._Patent_No._8434,020 ( `` '020_patent `` ) are directed to patent_ineligible_subject_matter under 35 U.S.C.¡± 101 ; ( 2 ) denying judgment as matter of law that U.S. Patent No._6415,164 ( `` Blanchard '' ) anticipates the asserted claims under 35 U.S.C.¡± 102 ; and ( 3 ) denying judgment as a matter of law that the claims are not infringed
For the reasons discussed below we affirm

BACKGROUND
The '476 and '020_patent s disclose improved display interfaces particularly for electronic_devices with small_screens like mobile_telephones
'020_patent 1_at_1 :14-24
The improved interfaces allow a user to more quickly access desired data stored in and functions of applications included in the electronic_devices
Id.at 2:20-44
An application_summary_window_displays `` a limited_list of common functions and commonly accessed stored data which itself can be reached directly from the main_menu listing some or all applications ''
Id.at 2:55-59
The application_summary_window can be reached in two steps : `` first launch a main view which shows various applications ; then launch the appropriate summary window for the application of interest ''
Id.at 2:61-64
The patents explain that the disclosed application_summary_window `` is far faster and easier than conventional navigation approaches '' particularly for devices with small_screens
Id.at 2:64-65

Core_Wireless Licensing S.A.R.L
( `` Core_Wireless '' ) sued LG alleging LG infringed dependent_claims 8_and_9 of the '476_patent and dependent_claims 11_and_13 of the '020_patent
Claims 8_and_9 of the '476_patent depend from claim 1 which recites ( emphases added ) : 1
A computing_device comprising a display_screen the computing_device being configured to display on the screen a menu listing one or more_applications and additionally being configured to display on the screen an application_summary that can be reached directly from the menu wherein the application_summary displays a limited_list of data offered within the one or more_applications each of the data in the list being selectable to launch the respective_application and enable the selected data to be seen within the respective_application and wherein the application_summary is displayed while the one or more_applications are in an un-launched state
*1360 Claims 11_and_13 of the '020_patent depend from claim 1 which recites ( emphases added ) : 1
A computing_device comprising a display_screen the computing_device being configured to display on the screen a main_menu listing at least a first_application and additionally being configured to display on the screen an application_summary_window that can be reached directly from the main_menu wherein the application_summary_window_displays a limited_list of at least one function offered within the first_application each function in the list being selectable to launch the first_application and initiate the selected function and wherein the application_summary_window is displayed while the application is in an un-launched state

LG moved for summary_judgment of invalidity of the asserted claims under 35 U.S.C.¡± 101 which the court denied
The district_court found claim 1 of the '476_patent representative for the purposes of evaluating patent eligibility
It held that the claims are not directed to an abstract_idea because even crediting LG 's characterization of the claims as directed to `` displaying an application_summary_window while the application is in an un-launched state '' the concepts of `` application '' `` summary window '' and `` unlaunched_state '' are specific to devices like computers and cell phones
J.A
9561
The court explained `` LG identifie [ d ] no analog to these concepts outside the context of such devices ''
Id
It further noted even `` if claim 1 were directed to an abstract_idea it would still be patent eligible at least because it passes the machine-or-transformation test ''
J.A
9562

The case proceeded to trial and the district_court after hearing initial testimony determined `` an O2 Micro situation '' existed with respect to the claim terms `` un-launched state '' and `` reached directly '' and afforded both sides an opportunity to argue constructions of these terms
J.A
10277-78 ; see O2 Micro Int ' l Ltd. v. Beyond Innovation Tech Co. 521_F.3d_1351 1362 ( Fed
Cir
2008 ) ( `` When the parties present a fundamental dispute regarding the scope of a claim term it is the court 's duty to resolve it `` )
The district_court ruled that `` un-launched state '' means `` not displayed '' and `` reached directly '' means `` reached without an intervening step ''

The jury found all asserted claims infringed and not invalid
LG moved for judgment as matter of law of noninfringement arguing in part that a correct construction of `` un-launched state '' means `` not running '' and that under this construction no reasonable_jury could have found infringement
LG also argued that the `` reached directly '' limitation required user interaction with the main_menu and no reasonable_jury could have found infringement under such a construction
The district_court declined to revisit claim construction noting LG did not preserve its claim construction arguments in a Rule 50 ( a ) motion
The district_court further denied LG 's motion for judgment as a matter of law of noninfringement based on the court 's adopted constructions because evidence was presented at trial from which the jury reasonably could have found that the application_summary_window in the accused devices could be reached directly from the main_menu

The district_court also denied LG 's motion for judgment of a matter of law of anticipation by Blanchard
Although Core_Wireless elected not to call an expert to testify in rebuttal to LG 's validity expert the district_court noted that the jury was not required to credit LG 's expert testimony and concluded `` LG failed to overcome the presumption of validity accorded to the '476 and '020_Patent s by clear and convincing evidence ''
