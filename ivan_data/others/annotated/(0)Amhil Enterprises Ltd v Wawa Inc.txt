In Amhil I the district_court granted defendant Ivonis Mazzarolo 's ( Mazzarolo 's ) motion to dismiss the complaint as to him for lack of personal jurisdiction
In Amhil_II the court granted defendant M & N_Plastics Inc. 's ( M & N 's ) motion for summary_judgment of noninfringement of Amhil 's U.S. Patent No._4421,244 ( '244_patent ) both literally and under the doctrine of equivalents
Amhil had previously dismissed its infringement claim against the other defendant Wawa Inc. d/b/a Wawa_Food_Market ( Wawa ) by stipulation and order dated 4_March_1994
In that same stipulation M & N conceded that it was properly before the district_court

?
-- -- - The patent describes a thin flexible plastic container lid used for example in convenience stores and fast-food establishments to cover beverage containers
The patent professes that the lids are an improvement over prior_lids because in manufacture they facilitate fabrication by improving the strip ability from the mold in shipping and storage they require a smaller volume than prior_lids *1557 required and in use they have enhanced rim-gripping ability for a secure hold

Amhil filed suit against three defendants alleging infringement of its '244_patent : Wawa M & N and Mazzarolo
Wawa a New Jersey corporation is primarily a middle Atlantic regional convenience store chain with several stores located in Maryland
Wawa was providing one type of allegedly infringing cup_lids to its customers to cover beverages purchased in Wawa stores

He is a majority shareholder ( 75 % ) the only officer and the sole director of M & N ; the `` M '' in M & N stands for Mazzarolo
