Synopsis
Background : Patentee sued competitor for infringement of patent related to patient_identification_system
The United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of California Frank C. Damrell Jr. J. 2006_WL_1652518 dismissed action finding patent unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct
Patentee appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Clevenger Senior_Circuit_Judge held that :

prior_art that applicant failed to disclose was not merely cumulative to prior_art which was before examiner ;

overwhelming circumstantial evidence coupled with lack of any credible_explanation for nondisclosure of prior_art supported finding that patentee had deceptive_intent ;

prior rejection of three-node communication claim would have been considered important by any reasonable examiner reviewing application ;

patentee intended to deceive Patent and Trademark_Office ( PTO ) by not disclosing to examiner adverse decisions by another examiner in a closely-related application ;

allowance of claims to a three-node communication system was material to application and should have been disclosed to examiner ; and

district_court 's holding patent unenforceable was not abuse of discretion

Affirmed

Newman Circuit_Judge filed a dissenting opinion

Plaintiff McKesson Information Solutions Inc. ( `` McKesson '' ) appeals the final decision of the United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of California dismissing McKesson 's infringement suit against defendant Bridge Medical Inc. ( `` Bridge '' ) after the court found the only patent at issue U.S. Patent No._4857,716 ( `` the ¡¬716_patent `` ) unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct

As set forth in considerable detail below this case involves McKesson 's nondisclosure of three items of information during prosecution of the ¡¬716_patent in a setting where the applicant had co-pending applications
The district_court found each of the three nondisclosures individually and collectively material to prosecution of the application that led to the ¡¬716_patent
With regard to deceptive_intent regarding each nondisclosure the district_court found circumstantial evidence strongly supports an inference of deceptive_intent
After assessing all the facts the district_court held that McKesson failed to provide a credible_explanation for the material nondisclosures
As the district_court noted this was not a case of mistake or negligence-the prosecuting attorney testified that he would make all the same nondisclosure decisions again if prosecuting the same applications today

The district_court 's thorough written opinion documents the court 's correct understanding and application of the relevant *902 precedent
The issues of materiality and intent are fact-driven
With regard to the issue of intent the law recognizes that deceptive_intent is virtually never shown or disproved by direct evidence
Instead the ultimate fact finding on the issue depends on assessment of all the inferences favorable and unfavorable that can be drawn from pertinent evidence
To prevail on appeal McKesson must demonstrate that the district_court 's findings of fact are clearly erroneous
After careful review of the record we conclude that McKesson has not met its burden and we therefore affirm

I
A
The ¡¬716_patent provides `` a patient_identification_system for relating items with patients and ensuring that an identified item corresponds to an identified patient ''
¡¬716_patent at [ 57 ]
This is accomplished first by providing a set of bar_codes associated with a given patient such that one bar_code from the set is physically attached to the patient and the other bar_codes from the set are physically attached to for example the patient 's medications ; and second by providing a portable handheld bar_code reader ( or patient_terminal ) wirelessly connected to a base_station unit ( typically located in the patient 's room ) that communicates via modem with a system_computer capable of `` processing and storing patient_data ''
Id
col.30 l.23-col.31 l.17
Thus among the handheld_patient_terminal the base_station and the system_computer the ¡¬716_patent teaches a `` three node_approach to communications ''
J.A.at 366
Moreover because the handheld_patient_terminals are portable it is desirable to prevent one such terminal from wirelessly communicating with a base_station in say an adjacent room
The base_stations of the ¡¬716_patent therefore include `` a programmable unique identifier '' that `` only allow [ s ] communication with a portable_handheld_patient_terminal.. having a corresponding program identifier ''
¡¬716_patent col.31 ll.2-7

The only_independent_claim of the ¡¬716_patent incorporates both of these features-i.e. three-node communications and a programmable unique identifier-as limitations
Claim 1 thus provides : 1
A patient identification and verification system comprising : ( a ) programmed system_computer means for processing and storing patient_data ; ( b ) input_means operatively interconnected to the programmed system_computer means for input of data to the programmed system_computer means ; ( c ) output means operatively interconnected to the programmed system_computer means for output of data from the programmed system_computer means ; ( d ) first bar_code identifier means adapted for attachment to a patient for identification of the patient the bar_code identifier means including a patient unique code ; ( e ) a plurality of second_bar_code_identifier_means for identifying patient care related items such as medication etc
; ( f ) the input_means and output means including : ( i ) microprocessor controlled portable_handheld_patient_terminal means having bar_code reader means for scanning the first bar_code identifier means to identify the patient and for scanning the second_bar_code_identifier_means for relating various items to a specific patient the portable_handheld_patient_terminal means further including keyboard means for data entry and display means for display of information the portable *903 handheld_patient_terminal means including electromagnetic_wave_transceiver_means including means for transmission of patient and item_data as an electromagnetic_wave which is representative of the first and second_bar_code_identifier_means scanned by the bar_code reader means and including means for receipt of data as an electromagnetic_wave ; ( ii ) microprocessor controlled base_station means including electromagnetic_wave_transceiver_means for receipt of and transmission of the patient and item_data as an electromagnetic_wave to the electromagnetic_wave_transceiver_means of the portable_handheld_patient_terminal means the base_station means being interconnected to the programmed system_computer means at least in part by electrical_lines for receipt and transmission of the patient and item_data on the electrical_lines to the programmed system_computer means the base_station means includes a programmable unique identifier the base_station means including means for only allowing communication with a portable handheld patent [ sic ] terminal means having a corresponding program identifier the patient system including means for programming the portable_handheld_patient_terminal means with the corresponding identifier [ `` programmable unique identifier '' limitation ] ; and
( iii ) the programmed system_computer means including program means for verifying the patient and item_data properly correspond and transmitting an alarm signal if improper correspondence noted

col.30 l.23-col.31 l.17 ( emphasis added )

On October 6 1987 claim 1 was submitted in substantially this form-except that the `` programmable unique identifier '' limitation was separated as a limitation in dependent_claim 6-as part of parent Application No._06 /862,278 ( `` the ¡¬278_application '' ) ( subsequently abandoned ) in response to an April_6,_1987 rejection by Examiner David Trafton of the United States Patent and Trademark_Office ( `` PTO '' )
Accompanying this submission were the remarks of prosecuting attorney Michael Schumann : None of the references either singularly or in combination teach or suggest the claimed invention
In addition to numerous other differences none of the references teach the three node_approach to communications as provided in the claimed invention
In the present_invention the first node of communication is a main or central computer which may have its own terminals for entry/display of information
The second node of communication are [ sic ] the base_stations which are wired to the main_computer
The base_stations are preferably located in the various patient rooms and other suitable locations
The third node of communication in the present_invention is the portable_handheld_patient_terminal which cooperates with the base_stations to provide for wireless_transmission of data between the base_station and the patient_terminal
This approach provides a system which allows for maximum portability of the patient_terminals and yet allows access to the main_computer in an inexpensive manner by use of the base_stations which provide wired communication to the main_computer
Many of the references such as Koenig do disclose the use of wireless_transmission which has long been in use and many of the systems do disclose the use of bar_code readers to scan bar_codes to see if they correspond
However none of the references disclose the real time interactive three node *904 communication system of the present_invention as claimed
J.A.at 366-67 ( emphasis added )

In a December 8 1987 office action Examiner_Trafton maintained his rejection of amended claim 1 albeit based upon a different combination of prior_art references patents to Blum and Pejas
However Examiner_Trafton also explained that dependent_claim 6 would be allowable if rewritten in independent form
J.A.at 371
Schumann accepted this offer on June_8,_1988 by abandoning the ¡¬278_application and filing a continuation application ( Application No._07 /205,527 ) with the only_independent_claim rewritten in the manner suggested by Examiner_Trafton
The claims in their current form were allowed on February 27 1989 and the ¡¬716_patent issued on August 15 1989
