BACKGROUND
I
The Patented Technology
The '329_patent generally relates to a `` system and method for inspecting railroad_tracks '' with the use of digital_technology
'329_patent Abstract
Specifically it discloses a system for inspecting tie_plates which are steel plates that connect the steel rail tracks to wooden_ties
Id
col. 2_ll._19 -31 ; J.A
928
Tie plates can sink or cut into the wooden_ties and disrupt railroad service
'329_patent Abstract
The '329_patent purportedly improves the *1234 prior art by automating the examination of misaligned tie_plates a process that was historically performed manually with certain software systems

col. 1_l._39 -col. 2_l._6_(describing_the_prior_art)

Claim 16 the only asserted claim recites : A system for inspecting a railroad_track_bed including the railroad_track to be mounted on a vehicle for movement along the railroad_track the system comprising : at least one light generator positioned adjacent the railroad_track for projecting a beam of light across the railroad_track_bed ; at least one optical receiver positioned adjacent the railroad_track for receiving at least a portion of the light reflected from the railroad_track_bed and generating a plurality of images representative of the profile of at least a portion of the railroad_track_bed ; and.at least one processor for analyzing the plurality of images and determining one or more_physical_characteristics of the said portion of the railroad_track_bed the one or more_physical_characteristics comprising at least a geographic location of the plurality of images along the railroad_track_bed wherein the processor includes an algorithm for detecting a misaligned or sunken tie_plate of the railroad_track_bed the algorithm comprising the steps of : ( a ) analyzing a frame of the plurality of images the frame comprising a region of interest ; ( b ) determining whether the region of interest contains a tie_plate ; ( c ) if a tie_plate is present determining a crosstie_contour and a tie_plate_contour ; ( d ) comparing an orientation of the crosstie_contour and an orientation of the tie_plate_contour ; and
( e ) determining whether the tie_plate is misaligned or sunken based upon the comparison
