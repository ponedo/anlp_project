BACKGROUND
Under 35 U.S.C.¡± 251 a patentee may within two years of the issuance of a patent seek a broadening reissue of that patent if among other things the patentee originally claimed `` less than he had a right to claim ''
See MBO Labs. Inc. v. Becton Dickinson & Co. 602_F.3d_1306 1313 ( Fed.Cir.2010 )
However under the rule against recapture `` a patentee is precluded from regaining the subject matter that he surrendered in an effort to obtain allowance of the original claims ''
N. Am Container Inc. v. Plastipak Packaging Inc. 415_F.3d_1335 1349 ( Fed.Cir.2005 ) ( internal quotation marks omitted )
This case presents the question of whether broadening claims 12_and_13 of the reissued REBIG_TOKEN__¡¬370_patent__BIG_TOKEN ( the claims at issue in this case ) improperly recaptured claim scope *1264 that Xicor1 had previously surrendered during the prosecution of its predecessor U.S. Patent No._5977,585 ( `` the ¡¬585_patent `` )
