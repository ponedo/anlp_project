Opinion
RADER Circuit_Judge
After a jury trial the United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of California entered judgment in favor of Genentech that all claims of U.S. Patent No._6054,561 are invalid under 35 U.S.C.¡± 102 because none of the asserted claims is entitled to priority to a series of applications *1250 filed in 1984 1985 and 1986
Chiron_Corp. v. Genentech Inc. No
Civ
S-00-1252 WBS_GGH ( Sept. 9 & Oct._23,_2002 )
Because Chiron did not adequately disclose or support the subject_matter of its ¡¬561_patent in its 1984 1985 or 1986 applications this court affirms the district_court 's denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law ( JMOL ) and motion for a new_trial

I
The ¡¬561_patent claims particular monoclonal_antibodies
Specifically independent claim 19 states:1 `` A monoclonal_antibody that binds to human_c-erbB-2_antigen ''

According to modern understanding a monoclonal_antibody is a composition with a homogeneous_antibody_population
An antibody is a protein generated by the immune_system that is capable of recognizing and binding to a specific_antigen
Described in terms of its structure an antibody is a Y-shaped protein consisting of four amino acid chains two heavy and two light
In a simplified model sufficient for this appeal each antibody has primarily two regions : a variable_region and a constant_region
The variable_region located on the ends of the arms of the Y binds to and interacts with the target_antigen
This variable_region includes a complementary determining region ( CDR ) that recognizes and binds to a specific binding site on a particular antigen
The constant_region located on the tail of the Y is recognized by and interacts with the immune_system

A target_antigen generally has numerous binding sites also called epitopes recognized by CDRs on multiple antibodies
Each antibody that specifically binds to a different epitope has a different structure
Thus one antigen may have more than one corresponding antibody
In this case claim 19 of the ¡¬ 561 patent reads on monoclonal_antibodies that bind to human_c-erbB-2_antigen ( also named HER2 ) -an antigen associated with breast_cancer cells

There are various methods of producing monoclonal_antibodies
One method uses hybridoma technology which refers to a cloned cell line that produces a single type of antibody
The hybridoma_method uses the cells of various species including mice hamsters rats and humans
Murine antibodies-derived from mouse cells-are particularly important for this invention

Another method uses genetic engineering including recombinant DNA techniques
Monoclonal antibodies made from these techniques include among others chimeric_antibodies and humanized_antibodies
A chimeric_antibody combines DNA encoding regions from more than one type of species
For example a chimeric_antibody may derive the variable_region from a mouse and the constant_region from a human
A humanized_antibody comes predominantly from a human even though it contains nonhuman_portions
Like a chimeric_antibody a humanized_antibody may contain a completely human_constant_region
But unlike a chimeric_antibody the variable_region may be partially derived from a human
The nonhuman *1251 synthetic portions of a humanized_antibody often come from CDRs in murine_antibodies
In any event these regions are crucial to allow the antibody to recognize and bind to a specific_antigen

As noted murine_antibodies play an important role in these technologies
While useful for diagnostics and short-term therapies murine_antibodies can not be administered to people long-term without increasing the risk of a deleterious immunogenic response
This response called Human Anti-Mouse Antibody ( HAMA ) occurs when a human immune_system recognizes the murine_antibody as foreign and attacks it
A HAMA_response can cause toxic shock or even death

Chimeric and humanized_antibodies reduce the likelihood of a HAMA_response by minimizing the nonhuman_portions of administered antibodies
Furthermore chimeric and humanized_antibodies have the additional benefit of activating secondary human immune responses such as antibody dependent cellular cytoxicity

In the early 1980s scientists at Chiron 's predecessor corporation Cetus Corp. ( collectively Chiron ) began investigating monoclonal_antibodies that target human breast_cancer antigens
As noted above the antigen that facilitates diagnosis and treatment of breast_cancer was eventually named HER2
This investigational work led to a series of patent applications
The inventors filed their first application on February 8 1984
Within a year on January 11 1985 they filed a continuation-in-part ( CIP ) application claiming priority based on that first 1984 application
The inventors filed another CIP application on May_21,_1986
Eventually the application that led to the ¡¬ 561 patent was filed as another CIP on June_7,_1995
This appeal focuses on the ¡¬561_patent 's claims to priority based on the applications filed in 1984 1985 and 1986

The 1984 application discloses one monoclonal_antibody ( 454C11 ) that binds to HER2
The 454C11 is a murine_antibody produced by the hybridoma_method
While the application discloses the deposit of the hybridoma that produced the monoclonal_antibody the application does not identify the structure function or molecular_weight of the antigen
Because the first_publication that disclosed chimeric_antibody_technology did not appear until four months after this filing it is not surprising that the 1984 application does not disclose any chimeric_antibodies
Similarly the first_publication to disclose humanized_antibodies appeared in May 1986
Thus for good reason this 1984 application also does not mention any humanized_antibodies

The 1985 application discloses six additional monoclonal_antibodies that bind to HER2 all of which are murine_antibodies
The disclosure also refers to the deposit of an additional hybridoma for one of these monoclonal_antibodies 520C9
While the application provides an approximate antigen molecular_weight of 210 kilodaltons,2 the application does not describe the identity structure or function of the antigen
The application does however note that six of the seven antibodies likely bind to the same epitope
By the time of this application chimeric_antibody_technology was known in this art field
Although the application does not specifically disclose chimeric or humanized_antibodies it adds the following disclosure :

As used herein the term `` monoclonal_antibody '' means an antibody composition having a homogeneous_antibody_population
It is not intended to be limited as regards the source of the *1252 antibody or the manner in which it is made
The 1986 application discloses six additional murine_antibodies that bind to HER2 and the deposit for three additional hybridomas
Thus this application discloses a total of thirteen murine_antibodies and deposits for five of their corresponding hybridomas including those corresponding to 454CBIG_TOKEN__11_and_520__BIG_TOKEN C9
The application discloses that these antibodies likely bind to at least three different epitopes on HER2
Although still not identifying the antigen by name the application discloses that its molecular_weight is approximately 200 kilodaltons
Although the 1986 application makes no specific mention of chimeric or humanized_antibodies it quotes again the statement that the term monoclonal_antibody `` is not intended to be limited as regards the source of the antibody or the manner in which it is made ''

When the ¡¬561_patent issued Chiron sued Genentech over sales of Herceptin THE_R a humanized_antibody useful for the long-term treatment of breast_cancer
Herceptin binds to the HER2 antigen and thus inhibits the growth of cancerous cells
Because Herceptin is a humanized_antibody it minimizes any HAMA_response in patients

Before trial the district_court broadly construed the claims of the ¡¬561_patent to embrace chimeric and humanized_antibodies in addition to the murine_antibodies that bind to HER2
Chiron_Corp. v. Genentech Inc. 266_F.Supp.2d_1172_(E.D.Cal.2002)
Accordingly the district_court subsequently granted Chiron 's motion for partial summary judgment of infringement
Chiron_Corp. v. Genentech Inc. No

Also before trial the parties stipulated that the ¡¬561_patent would be invalid under ¡± 102 based on intervening prior art if the patent were not entitled to claim priority to the filing_date of any one of the 1984 1985 and 1986 applications
Thus the thirteen-day jury trial adjudicated only whether any of the priority_applications satisfy the written description and enablement requirements of 35 U.S.C.¡± 112 first paragraph
Specifically the trial determined whether the 1980s applications adequately disclosed and thus supported the claim to chimeric and humanized_antibodies claimed in the ¡¬561_patent ( with its filing_date in 1995 )
The jury determined that Genentech proved by clear and convincing evidence that none of the applications satisfy both the written description and the enablement requirement for the subject_matter in the ¡¬ 561 patent 's claims
The verdict form however did not require the jury to specify the particular requirement of ¡± 112 left unfulfilled by each disclosure of the priority_applications
After trial the district_court denied Chiron 's motions for JMOL and a new_trial

Chiron appeals the denial of its post-trial motions and Genentech conditionally `` cross-appeals '' the district_court 's claim construction
Although styled as a cross-appeal this court treats this claim construction issue as an alternative ground for affirming the judgment
A cross-appeal is only proper if `` a party seeks to enlarge its own rights under the judgment or to lessen the rights of its adversary under the judgment ''

This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295
