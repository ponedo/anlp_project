Opinion
*1371 BRYSON Circuit_Judge
Tyco Healthcare Group LP and Mallinckrodt Inc. ( collectively `` Tyco '' ) appeal from a summary_judgment invalidating the two claims of U.S. Patent No._5211,954 ( `` the ¡¬954_patent `` ) for obviousness
We affirm

I. Temazepam is a hypnotic ( sleep-inducing ) drug that is one of a class of compounds known as benzodiazepines
Pharmacological formulations of temazepam have been marketed internationally for the treatment of insomnia since the 1970s and in the United_States since 1981 under the name RestorilTHE_R
Tyco holds the rights to the ¡¬954_patent which has two claims for temazepam formulations
Claim 1 reads : A hard gelatin capsule containing a temazepam formulation consisting essentially of 6_to_8 milligrams of crystalline_temazepam having a surface_area of from 0.BIG_TOKEN__65_to_1__BIG_TOKENBIG_TOKEN__1_m_2__BIG_TOKEN /g and 95 % of the temazepam having a particle size of less than 65 microns in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor
Claim 2 is identical except that it recites a composition containing 7.5 milligrams of crystalline_temazepam
The ¡¬954_patent issued in May 1993 with a priority_date of September 1986
Tyco 's predecessor-in-interest began marketing RestorilTHE_R in 7.5 mg dosages in 1991

In November 2006 Mutual Pharmaceutical Company Inc. filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application ( `` ANDA '' ) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( `` FDA '' ) seeking approval to manufacture and sell a generic version of 7.5 mg_temazepam_capsules
Tyco responded in March 2007 by filing an infringement action against Mutual and United_Research_Laboratories Inc. ( collectively `` Mutual '' )
In July 2009 after Mutual had received tentative FDA approval of its ANDA Tyco moved for a preliminarily injunction to prevent Mutual from selling its generic temazepam capsule
The district_court denied Tyco 's motion based on uncontroverted evidence that Mutual 's ANDA disclosed a product that could not literally infringe the ¡¬954_patent because the ANDA required the surface_area of the crystalline_temazepam to be at least 2.2 square meters per gram
See Bayer AG v. Elan Pharm
Research Corp. 212_F.3d_1241 1249 ( Fed.Cir.2000 )

Mutual then moved for summary_judgment of noninfringement and invalidity
The district_court granted Mutual 's motion with respect to invalidity concluding that Mutual had shown by clear and convincing evidence that the ¡¬954_claims were obvious and that no reasonable trier of fact could find to the contrary
In reaching that conclusion the court noted first that RestorilTHE_R capsules had been sold in the United_States in 15 mg and 30 mg dosages more than a year before the priority_date of the ¡¬954_patent
Second the court looked to a 1983 volume of the British National Formulary ( `` BNF '' ) a medical_reference_book published in the United Kingdom which directed physicians to the use of temazepam at a dosage between 5_and_15 mg for the treatment of insomnia in the elderly
Third the court observed that the parties did not dispute that `` physicians always seek to prescribe the lowest_effective_dose of any medication particularly hypnotics such as temazepam ''
Based on those undisputed facts the court concluded that it would have been obvious to a person of ordinary_skill in the art to combine the preexisting 15 mg RestorilTHE_R capsule with the dosage range identified in the BNF_reference
Tyco appeals the district_court 's order invalidating the ¡¬954_claims

*1372 II
The only physical feature distinguishing the ¡¬954_claims from the RestorilTHE_R 15 mg capsules is the amount of temazepam contained in the capsule
In 1987 Tyco 's predecessor-in-interest filed a Supplemental New Drug Application with the FDA for manufacture and sale of 7.5 mg_temazepam_capsules within the scope of both ¡¬954_claims
The application stated that : [ t ] he formulation and manufacture of RestorilTHE_R Capsules 7.5 mg are similar to that used for the 15_and_30 milligram capsules..
The formulation differs only in the reduction of the dose..
The capsule manufacturing method is exactly the same as has been described for the currently marketed doses
Given that uncontested description the only limitation of the two ¡¬954_claims that was not fully disclosed by the prior_art RestorilTHE_R capsules is the lower dosage of temazepam

The BNF is a medical_reference_book published semiannually by the British Medical Association and the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain
The Preface to the BNF explains that it serves as `` a pocket book for rapid reference.. for prescribing and dispensing '' drugs and that its entries `` are intended to help in the choice of appropriate treatment of each patient ''
The 1983 BNF entry for `` temazepam '' reads as follows : Indications : insomnia ( useful in the elderly ) Cautions ; Side-effects : see under Nitrazepam,1 but except at high dosage hangover is uncommon and doses less cumulative
Less appropriate in patients with early wakening

Dose : 10-30 mg ( elderly_patients 5-15 mg ) increasing in severe insomnia to 60 mg 30 minutes before bedtime
BNF at 127 ( emphasis added )
The district_court concluded that `` [ t ] his entry plainly tells one of skill in the art to treat insomnia in the elderly by administering a dose in the range of 5_to_15 mg. '' 2 The court noted that a physician would be motivated to prescribe a temazepam dosage lower than 15 mg because of the preference for the lowest_effective_dose particularly in the case of elderly_patients sensitive to the side effects of hypnotic medications
Ordinarily `` where there is a range disclosed in the prior_art and the claimed invention falls within that range there is a presumption of obviousness ''
*1373 Iron Grip Barbell Co. v. USA Sports Inc. 392_F.3d_1317 1322 ( Fed.Cir.2004 ) ; accord Lazare Kaplan Int ' l Inc. v. Photoscribe Techs. Inc. 628_F.3d_1359 1380-81 ( Fed.Cir.2010 )
That presumption is rebuttable either by a showing that the prior_art taught away from the invention or by a showing of new and unexpected_results relative to the prior_art
Iron Grip Barbell 392 F.3d at 1322
Tyco argues first that the BNF_reference does not direct a person of ordinary_skill in the art to temazepam hard capsules in the 5_to_15 mg dosage range
It then argues that the prior_art as a whole taught away from a range of 6_to_8 mg
Finally Tyco contends that secondary considerations of new and unexpected_results and commercial success support a finding of non-obviousness
