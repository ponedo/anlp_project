Opinion
PROST Circuit_Judge
This is a patent infringement case
Defendant Ford Motor Company ( `` Ford '' ) appeals *1263 a $ 56 million judgment against it
Ford argues that the district_court made a series of errors in both its infringement and validity analyses as well as in its award of enhanced damages for willful infringement
Because the district_court erred in holding that the patent-in-suit could be found novel over the prior_art we reverse as to validity vacate the other rulings and remand for entry of judgment of non-liability

I
This case 's lengthy history began in February 1989 when Jacob Krippelz Sr. now deceased filed for a patent on a vehicle-mounted lamp.1 Mr._Krippelz titled the resulting patent `` Emergency Light ''
U.S._Patent_No._5017,903 ( `` ¡¬903_patent `` ) at [ 54 ]
It described a lamp attached to the side_view_mirror of an automobile and shining downward :

?
Id
fig.1
As described by Mr._Krippelz the lamp was for use in inclement weather like rain or fog
Its light would reflect off water dust or other airborne particles so as to be visible to other_drivers but not interfere with either their vision or that of the person driving the car
See generally id
col. 1
Mr._Krippelz 's patent issued in 1991
He says he sent a copy of it to Ford shortly thereafter but that Ford was not interested in taking a license
For a period of years nothing happened

Then in 1997 Ford began offering a new option on its Explorer and other model automobiles which we will refer to as a `` puddle_light ''
The puddle_light was a lamp attached to the vehicle 's side_view_mirror that shone light generally downward
Ford 's puddle_light was equipped with a lens that diffused the light in such a way as to illuminate the vehicle 's side

Mr._Krippelz viewed the puddle_light as infringing and in 1998 he sued
Complaint Krippelz v. Ford Motor Co. No._98- CV-2361 [ hereinafter Krippelz ] ( N.D.Ill
Apr._16,_1998 ) ECF No._1
The case revolved around claim 2 of the ¡¬903_patent which reads : 2
An emergency warning light for an automotive vehicle having a window on one side thereof comprising in combination
a housing mounted in a fixed substantially unadjustable position on said vehicle adjacent to said window said housing having an opening in the bottom thereof a source of light mounted within said housing for directing a conical_beam of light downwardly through said opening along said side of said vehicle below said window so as to be visible *1264 from in front of and behind said vehicle and
said opening and said source of light being positioned to prevent said beam of light from directly impinging on said side of said vehicle
¡¬903_patent col. 3_l._19 -col. 4_l._3

About a year after filing the complaint Mr._Krippelz asked the Patent and Trademark Office ( `` PTO '' ) to reexamine the ¡¬903_patent
An Information Disclosure Statement accompanying the request acknowledged the ongoing litigation noted that Ford had raised invalidity as a defense and attached `` all the references Ford has identified to the Requestor during the litigation ''

Disclosure Stmt

File Hist. J.A
12516 12517
The PTO instituted reexamination proceedings and subsequently confirmed the validity of all the ¡¬903_patent 's claims over the submitted prior_art
See generally Reexam
Certificate U.S._Patent_No._5017,903 C1 ( issued Aug._13,_2002 )
As part of the reexamination process new claims were also added to the ¡¬903_patent which Mr._Krippelz states were subsequently asserted against Ford in separate litigation
Those claims are not part of this appeal

Over the next several years the district_court handled a number of summary_judgment and claim construction issues which we will not recount except to state that there was much dispute about the appropriate manner in which to analyze Ford 's puddle_lights for infringement
For our purposes we note that in 2008 Mr._Krippelz moved for summary_judgment of infringement which the court granted from the bench.2 Tr

Infringement having been summarily addressed the case proceeded to trial on validity and damages
Ford argued that claim 2 was anticipated or at least rendered obvious by French Patent No._1031,294 ( trans )
( published June_22,_1953 ) J.A
13430 to DuBois [ hereinafter DuBois ]
DuBois which did not appear in the ¡¬903_patent prosecution history taught a `` system of lamps and optical_devices '' for illuminating the pavement next to a vehicle
The idea was to give other_drivers a clear view of the vehicle 's side and the adjacent area so that they could know if there was enough room to pass
DuBois J.A
13431
Ford argued that DuBois taught all the limitations of claim 2
Mr._Krippelz presented opinion testimony from an expert that DuBois failed to teach two limitations namely a `` conical_beam of light '' and a lamp located `` adjacent '' to the vehicle window

The jury returned its verdict for Mr._Krippelz
It found the ¡¬903_patent valid over DuBois and awarded $ 23 million in damages for Ford 's infringement
Jury Verdict Krippelz ( N.D.Ill.BIG_TOKEN__Dec._12 _2008__BIG_TOKEN ) ECF No._429
Following a bench trial on willfulness the court found Ford 's infringement *1265 willful and awarded Mr._Krippelz a further $ 11.7 million in prejudgment interest and another $ 21 million in enhanced damages
See Krippelz 670_F.Supp.2d_806_(N.D.Ill.2009) ( concerning willfulness ) ; Krippelz 670_F.Supp.2d_815 ( N.D.Ill.2009 ) ( concerning damages ) ; Krippelz 675_F.Supp.2d_881_(N.D.Ill.2009) ( making fact findings and conclusions of law )

Ford moved for judgment of invalidity as a matter of law ; its motion was denied
Krippelz 750_F.Supp.2d_938 ( N.D.Ill.2010 ) [ hereinafter JMOL Op ]
Ford timely appealed
