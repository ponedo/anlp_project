LOURIE Circuit_Judge
Jack A. Ekchian appeals from the final judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Virginia granting summary_judgment of non-infringement in favor of Lucas_Automation & Control_Engineering Inc. ( `` Lucas '' )
Ekchian v. Home Depot Inc. No._95-1273- A ( E.D.Va
Dec._8,_1995 ) ( as corrected by Order entered on Dec._11,_1995 )
Because the district_court misconstrued the asserted claims and because under a proper_claim_construction genuine_issues of material_fact remain in dispute we vacate and remand

BACKGROUND
Ekchian is the owner and a named co-inventor of U.S._Patent 4,624,140
The '140_patent concerns variable_capacitance_displacement_sensors which can be used as inclinometers ( such as in a carpenter 's level ) to measure degree of inclination or tilt
Variable capacitance inclinometers use an internal capacitor having a capacitance that is proportional to the degree of inclination

A capacitor is formed by sandwiching a dielectric between two conductive surfaces or `` plates ''
Capacitors store electric_charge on the `` overlapping '' portions of the two conductive_plates creating an electric_field across the dielectric_material
An ideal capacitor has completely conductive_plates and a non-conductive dielectric_material so that charges flow easily through the plates but do not cross the dielectric thereby accumulating at the boundaries formed by the plates and the dielectric
Because real-world materials rarely approach the ideal capacitors generally have less than perfectly conductive_plates and contain dielectric_materials that conduct some charge
Generally for a capacitor to function properly the conductivity of the capacitor_plates must be substantially greater than the conductivity of the dielectric

The capacitance of a capacitor generally depends upon three factors
Capacitance is proportional to the area of overlap of the conductive_plates and to the magnitude of the `` dielectric constant '' of the dielectric_material ( a fixed value for a given material ) and it is inversely proportional to the thickness of the dielectric

Prior art variable capacitance inclinometers generally used two solid plates with a liquid_dielectric partially filling the space between the plates
The remainder of the space was filled by a gas that typically had a substantially lower dielectric constant than the liquid
Thus the average_dielectric_constant was a function of both the liquid and the gas
These inclinometers were constructed so that as they were tilted the amount of liquid filling the space between the plates changed
As the ratio of liquid to gas changed the average_dielectric_constant of the space changed thereby affecting the measured capacitance across the plates

The '140 invention differs from these prior_art inclinometers by replacing the liquid with a solid_dielectric and replacing one of the *1301 fixed capacitor_plates with a conductive_liquid
The patent_specification discloses a vessel partially filled with a conductive_liquid that has a solid conducting interior_wall with a thin_dielectric_coating
A capacitor is formed by the overlap of the liquid and the vessel_wall ( or fixed plate ) which are separated from each other by the thin_dielectric_coating as illustrated below

?
-- -- -

As the vessel is tilted the amount of liquid in contact with the dielectric_coating changes
Instead of varying the average_dielectric_constant the claimed device varies the amount of overlap between the vessel_wall and the liquid in proportion to the degree of inclination
Because the thickness of the dielectric_coating can be considerably less than the thickness of a liquid_dielectric the claimed device improves on the prior_art by producing a substantially greater capacitance compared with the prior_art devices
Claim 1 with emphasis added is representative of the asserted claims and reads as follows : 1
A capacitive displacement sensor comprising
a vessel having a wall including at least two adjacent conductive wall_segments means for electrically insulating said wall_segments from each other a dielectric_coating on the interior of at least one but not all of said wall_segments the interior of at least one conductive wall_segment being exposed a conductive_liquid-like_medium contained inside said vessel covering a variable part of at least one wall_segment with said dielectric_coating and at least one wall_segment without said dielectric_coating and
electronic means electrically connected to at least one wall_segment with said coating and at least one wall_segment without said coating for producing an output related to the capacitance between said liquid-like_medium and said one wall_segment with said dielectric_coating whereby displacement of said vessel causes relative movement between said vessel and said liquid-like_medium and a concomitant detectable change in the capacitance between said liquid-like_medium and the wall_segment with the dielectric_coating

Ekchian filed suit against Lucas alleging that the Lucas `` Accustar '' inclinometers infringe every claim of the '140_patent
The accused device uses a vessel partially filled with liquid and has a thin film coating on an interior_wall
Lucas denied infringement claiming that the liquid in the accused device acts as a dielectric across which an electric_field is generated and that in any event its liquid is not sufficiently conductive to be covered by the claims of the patent

On Lucas 's motion for summary_judgment the district_court construed the claim_term `` conductive_liquid-like_medium '' as requiring a conductivity similar to the examples contained in the specification which exceed the conductivity level of the liquid in the accused device
The court held that in light of its claim_construction and based upon prosecution_history_estoppel the accused device did not infringe the patent literally or under the doctrine of equivalents

Determining whether a patent claim has been infringed requires a two-step analysis : `` First the claim must be properly construed to determine its scope and meaning
Second the claim as properly construed must be compared to the accused device or process ''

In construing the claims the court looks to the patent itself the prosecution_history and if necessary extrinsic evidence

Application of a properly construed claim to an accused device is a question of fact
On appeal from a grant of summary_judgment of noninfringement we must determine whether on the patentee 's version of the facts the district_court correctly concluded that the patentee had failed to show that a reasonable jury could find infringement
See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby Inc. 477_U.S._242 248 106_S.Ct._2505 2510 91_L.Ed.2d_202_(1986) ; Conroy 14 F.3d at 1575 29 USPQ2d at 1377 ( `` The moving party.. may discharge its burden by showing the district_court that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party 's case
`` )

In construing the claims of the '140_patent the district_court declined to adopt Ekchian 's proposed definition of `` conductive '' as `` the slightest ability to carry a current '' because it concluded that such an interpretation would render the limitation meaningless essentially reading the term `` conductive '' right out of the claims
Because Ekchian 's proposal would `` include virtually all liquids ( and indeed all materials ) on the planet '' the district_court sought a narrower definition that would render the term meaningful
The court concluded that as a matter of law the claimed conductive_liquid-like_medium did not extend to the liquid in the accused device
In particular it determined that the liquid in the accused device `` is vastly less conductive '' than the preferred liquid mentioned in the patent_specification and that the two liquids appear to be used for different purposes the invention employing a liquid as a capacitor_plate and the accused device employing a liquid as a dielectric

Ekchian argues that the district_court erred in its claim_construction by reading the conductivity of the preferred_embodiment into the claims
Ekchian contends that the patent does not impart any special meaning to the term `` conductive '' and therefore that the term 's ordinary_meaning to those skilled in the art should control
Lucas on the other hand contends that the district_court properly interpreted the claim in light of the specification and that the patent defines `` conductive_liquid-like_medium '' as being limited to liquids having a conductivity equal to or greater than the examples listed in the specification
To support its proposition Lucas relies on the following sentence in the specification which states `` Accordingly the label 'conductive_liquid-like_medium ' used herein shall refer to materials of whatever kind whether liquid or not meeting the foregoing requirements of flowability conformity horizontal surface retention and conductivity ''
'140_patent col. 5 line 66-col. 6 line 2

Lucas argues that the examples of conductive_liquids in the specification are the only *1303 `` foregoing requirements of.. conductivity '' disclosed in the patent and therefore must be read as limiting the claim_term
We do not agree
Contrary to the assertion by Lucas the expression `` the foregoing requirements '' also refers to the enumerated requirements immediately preceding the quotation which include `` [ i ] n addition all points beneath the horizontal upper surface of the liquid medium must be conductive preferably but not necessarily uniformly conductive. ``
'140_patent col. 5 lines 60-63
The statement thus is not a reference only to the stated examples as Lucas asserts

More importantly Lucas identifies nothing further to support its contention that the term `` conductive '' is limited to the conductivity_levels inherent in the disclosed examples
While examples disclosed in the preferred_embodiment may aid in the proper interpretation of a claim_term the scope of a claim is not necessarily limited by such examples
See Laitram Corp. v. Cambridge Wire Cloth Co. 863_F.2d_855 865 9_USPQ2d_1289 1299 ( Fed.Cir.1988 ) ( `` References to a preferred_embodiment such as those often present in a specification are not claim limitations
`` ) ; Texas_Instruments Inc. v. United_States_Int ' l_Trade_Comm ' n 805_F.2d_1558 1563 231_USPQ_833 835 ( Fed.Cir.1986 ) ( `` This court has cautioned against limiting the claimed invention to preferred_embodiments or specific examples in the specification `` )
We therefore conclude that the term is not so limited

Because the specification does not use the term `` conductive '' in a special or unique way its ordinary_meaning to one skilled in the art controls
See Quantum Corp. v. Rodime PLC 65_F.3d_1577 1580 36_USPQ2d_1162 1165 ( Fed.Cir.1995 ) ( `` [ T ] he words of a claim will be given their ordinary_meaning to one of skill in the art unless the inventor appeared to use them differently
`` ) ; cf
Texas_Instruments Inc. v. Cypress Semiconductor Corp. 90_F.3d_1558 1564 39_USPQ2d_1492 1497 ( Fed.Cir.1996 ) ( `` Although the dictionary broadly defines 'conductor ' as any substance that conducts an electrical charge the patent itself belies such a broad construction
`` )

Ekchian contends that those skilled in the art would recognize that the term `` conductive_liquid-like_medium '' in the context of the claimed invention refers to any material that is sufficiently more conductive than the dielectric so that a capacitor is formed
We agree
There is nothing in the patent_specification that suggests that Ekchian intended to limit the meaning of that term to a specific range of conductivity
This does not mean that the claim_term `` conductive '' is meaningless or superfluous
Both Lucas and Ekchian agree that the term `` conductive '' ordinarily means the ability to transport electric_charge
Furthermore it is undisputed that the specification and prosecution_history both state that the liquid must act as a capacitor_plate which must necessarily store electric_charge
Therefore one skilled in the art of capacitor design would recognize that the term `` conductive '' modifies `` liquid-like_medium '' in the claims to indicate that the liquid must act as a capacitor_plate i.e. that it must be sufficiently more conductive than the dielectric_material so that it stores electric_charge
Accordingly we hold that the district_court erred in its claim_construction by incorrectly limiting the degree of conductivity permitted by the term `` conductive_liquid-like_medium ''
Within the context of this patent `` conductive_liquid-like_medium '' means a medium sufficiently conductive to perform its function as a variable capacitor_plate

Ekchian also argues that the district_court erred by holding that prosecution_history_estoppel precludes a finding of infringement
He first contends and states the issue to be one of first impression that an Information_Disclosure_Statement ( `` IDS '' ) can not be the basis for an estoppel because it is not submitted to the Patent Office in order to overcome a rejection by the examiner
We do not agree with this argument
An IDS is part of the prosecution_history on which the examiner the courts and the public are entitled to rely
Ekchian distinguished his invention from the submitted prior_art as a kind of preemptive strike against a potential rejection
He intended his statement to be relied on
It is reasonable to infer absent an indication to the contrary that an examiner will consider an IDS when *1304 determining whether to allow the claims ; the courts and the public may rely on it as well
An argument contained in an IDS which purports to distinguish an invention from the prior_art thus may affect the scope of the patent ultimately granted
Accordingly we first hold that statements made in an IDS can be the basis for a court to interpret the scope of the claims of a granted patent
See Standard Oil Co. v. American Cyanamid Co. 774_F.2d_448 452 227_USPQ_293 296 ( Fed.Cir.1985 ) ( stating that the prosecution_history which includes `` all express representations made by or on behalf of the applicant to the examiner to induce a patent grant '' limits the interpretation of the claims `` so as to exclude any interpretation that may have been disclaimed or disavowed during prosecution in order to obtain claim allowance `` )
Moreover since by distinguishing the claimed invention over the prior_art an applicant is indicating what the claims do not cover he is by implication surrendering such protection
See Southwall Techs Inc. v. Cardinal IG Co. 54_F.3d_1570 1581 34_USPQ2d_1673 1681 ( Fed.Cir.1995 ) ( stating that the patentee having distinguished a prior_art reference in arguments made to the PTO `` can not now escape [ the defendant 's ] reliance upon this unambiguous surrender of subject matter '' )
To that extent we also hold that arguments in an IDS can create an estoppel and thus preclude a finding of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
See e.g. Texas_Instruments Inc. v. United_States_Int ' l_Trade_Comm ' n 988_F.2d_1165 1174 26_USPQ2d_1018 1025 ( Fed.Cir.1993 ) ( discussing impact of statements made in an invention disclosure form placed in PTO file in the context of prosecution_history_estoppel )

Ekchian next contends that even if the IDS is fair game for use in claim interpretation and for purposes of estoppel the district_court erred by mischaracterizing his arguments regarding the prior_art
The court determined that Ekchian differentiated his device from the prior_art on the ground that the liquid in his device was conducting while the liquid in the prior_art_patent was nonconducting
In light of the prosecution_history the court concluded that Ekchian 's claimed liquid-like_medium must necessarily be more conductive than the liquid disclosed in the prior_art_patent
Ekchian asserts that no such distinction was made
He contends that he differentiated his invention on the ground that he uses a solid_dielectric with a liquid capacitor_plate while the prior_art used a liquid_dielectric and solid capacitor_plate
We agree
The statements in the IDS distinguished the prior_art 's use of a liquid_dielectric from Ekchian 's invention as follows : [ The prior_art ] device differs from the inclinometer of the present invention in which a variable capacitance is established between a rigid wall of a vessel preferably spherical and an electrically conductive_fluid liquid paste or solid powder mixed in a liquid which acts as a conductive_liquid capacitor_plate as the device tilts
The vessel surface has a thin coating of a solid_dielectric_material of uniform thickness
( emphasis added ) Thus Ekchian did not distinguish the conductivity of his liquid from the conductivity of the liquid in the prior_art
In fact the prior_art_patent does not refer to the conductive properties of its disclosed liquid

Lucas argues nonetheless that Ekchian in the IDS explicitly referred to the prior_art liquid as an `` insulator '' and therefore contends that liquids having similar conductivity_levels can not be construed to be conductive within the scope of the claims or be considered equivalent to the claimed liquid
We find this argument to be without merit
Ekchian did refer generally to the benefits of using a solid insulator instead of a liquid insulator as a dielectric
However Ekchian did not characterize the specific liquid used in the prior_art device as an insulator nor did he state whether that liquid could be used as a conductor in a different device
Accordingly the prosecution_history supports the conclusion that the term `` conductive '' is not limited by the conductivity of the liquid disclosed in the prior_art

Finally given the proper_claim_construction we agree with Ekchian that genuine_issues of material_fact are in dispute
The district_court stated that `` the Lucas_liquid is employed as a non-conductive dielectric with the express purpose of regulating *1305 and/or impeding the charge flow across its capacitor_plates '' and `` [ t ] he Lucas_liquid operates in a manner that is virtually identical to that of the [ prior_art ] patent ''
Ekchian vigorously contests these characterizations of the accused device submitting evidence tending to indicate that the Lucas_liquid does not act as a dielectric
For example Ekchian submitted an affidavit in which he averred that ( 1 ) when the Lucas_liquid is replaced by a highly conductive_fluid its capacitance remains the same and ( 2 ) when the Lucas_liquid is replaced by a fluid with an extremely low conductivity its capacitance drops substantially
Both these tests support the conclusion that the electric_charges in Lucas 's accused device are stored in the liquid and not on the fixed plate
Ekchian 's tests thus support his position that the liquid in the accused device acts as a capacitor_plate and not as a dielectric as the district_court and Lucas both assumed

The district_court appeared to rely on Lucas 's assertion that its device operates in the same manner as described in U.S._Patent 4,644,662 which is assigned to Lucas
Ekchian submitted affidavits that may show that Lucas is incorrect
Because there is a genuine dispute as to whether the accused device uses its liquid as a dielectric or as a capacitor_plate the court erred by not resolving this doubt in favor of Ekchian on Lucas 's motion for summary_judgment
See Conroy v. Reebok_Int ' l Ltd. 14_F.3d_1570 1577 29_USPQ2d_1373 1378 ( Fed.Cir.1994 )
On remand it is for the fact-finder to determine whether the liquid in the accused device acts as the capacitor_plate i.e. stores the electric_charge that generates the measured capacitance
If the liquid acts as a capacitor_plate then the liquid is a `` conductive_liquid-like_medium '' within the meaning of the claims
