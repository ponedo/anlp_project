Synopsis
Background : Holders of patent for anti-cholesterol drug brought action alleging infringement after generic_producers initiated challenge to patent by filing an Abbreviated_New_Drug_Application ( ANDA ) accompanied by Paragraph_IV_certification
The United_States_District_Court for the District of Delaware Joseph J. Farnan Jr. J. 719_F.Supp.2d_388 held that patent was valid enforceable and infringed
Competitors appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Newman Circuit_Judge held that :

patent was not invalid on ground of obviousness ;

on claim of inequitable_conduct reference compounds that were sufficiently similar in structure to warrant citation were material to prosecution of application for patent ;

finding by district_court that deceptive intent was not shown and was not the single most reasonable inference was not clearly erroneous ;

unintentional failure to file Information Disclosure Statement ( IDS ) citing material prior_art references and omission of specific claim to preferred species did not warrant denial of reissue application ; and

agent and subsidiary could be held liable for patent infringement as `` submitter '' of ANDA

Affirmed

Plager Circuit_Judge filed concurring opinion

Mayer Circuit_Judge filed dissenting opinion

NEWMAN Circuit_Judge
This patent litigation arises under the Hatch-Waxman Act 21 U.S.C.¡± 355 whereby producers of generic pharmaceutical products are authorized to challenge the patent status of a federally registered and approved drug_product before the generic_producer has obtained approval to sell its counterpart of the approved product
The generic litigant who succeeds in eliminating the drug patent is granted a 180-day period of exclusivity against other potential providers of the generic product
21 U.S.C.¡± 355 ( j ) ( 5 ) ( B ) ( iv )

The drug_product here at issue is the `` statin '' having the brand name CrestorTHE_R which is federally approved for use in control of cholesterol and for treatment of atherosclerosis
In suit is United_States Reissue Patent No._37314 ( `` the ¡¬314_patent `` ) which is a reissue of *515 United_States Patent No._5260,440 ( `` the ¡¬440_patent `` )
The patentee is Shionogi_Seiyaku_Kabushiki_Kaisha ( `` Shionogi '' ) and the exclusive licensee is AstraZeneca UK and its United_States subsidiary IPR Pharmaceuticals Inc. ( collectively `` Plaintiffs '' )

The active ingredient of CrestorTHE_R is the calcium salt of a chemical compound whose common name is rosuvastatin of the following structural formula :

?
Rosuvastatin is one of several statin products that lower cholesterol production in the liver by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase
Scientists working at the Shionogi laboratory in Japan were conducting research in search of a statin with reduced_side_effects as compared with the statin products that were then known
In the course of this research in 1991 they discovered rosuvastatin and its beneficial properties
Patents were obtained in Japan and other countries including the ¡¬314_patent in the United_States
Federal approval for sale and use in the United_States was granted on August 12 2003 after over two decades of development
The product was highly successful due to its superior efficacy in lowering low-density ( LDL ) cholesterol and elevating high-density ( HDL ) cholesterol and its reduced_side_effects as compared with other commercial statins
See Peter H. Jones et al. Comparison of the Efficacy and Safety of Rosuvastatin Versus Atorvastatin Simvastatin and Pravastatin Across Doses ( STELLAR Trial ) 92 Am
J. Cardiology 152 ( 2003 )

Several generic_producers initiated a challenge to the ¡¬314_patent by filing an Abbreviated_New_Drug_Application ( ANDA ) accompanied by a Paragraph_IV_certification 21 U.S.C.¡± 355 ( j ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ( vii ) ( IV )
An ANDA permits a generic_producer to market a drug_product based on the federal approval obtained by the original registrant
Submission of an ANDA constitutes a statutory act of infringement pursuant to ¡± 271 ( e ) ( 2 ) of the Patent Act which provides : It shall be an act of infringement to submit an application under [ section 355 ( j ) of title 21 ].. for a drug claimed in a patent or the use of which is claimed in a patent.. if the purpose of such submission is to obtain approval under such Act to engage in the commercial manufacture use or sale of a drug veterinary biological product or biological product claimed in a patent or the use of which is claimed in a patent before the expiration of such patent
35 U.S.C.¡± 271 ( e ) ( 2 ) ( A )
If the challenge to the patent fails the ANDA can not be approved until expiration of the patent
35 U.S.C.¡± 271 ( e ) ( 4 ) ( A )

The infringement suits against the several generic challengers were consolidated in the United_States_District_Court for the District of Delaware
The Defendants are Aurobindo Pharma Ltd. Mylan_Pharmaceuticals_Inc. Apotex_Corp. Cobalt_Pharmaceuticals_Inc. and Cobalt_Laboratories_Inc. Sun_Pharmaceutical_Industries Ltd. Teva_Pharmaceuticals_USA Inc. Par Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Sandoz Inc
The Defendants argued that the ¡¬ *516 314 patent is invalid on the ground of obviousness and improper reissue and that the patent is unenforceable for inequitable_conduct in the Patent and Trademark Office ( `` PTO '' )

The district_court ruled that the ¡¬314_patent is valid enforceable and infringed.1 The Defendants all admitted infringement except for Apotex_Corp. All of the Defendants appeal the rulings of validity and enforceability

I. VALIDITY
The Defendants challenge patent validity on the ground of obviousness
Obviousness is decided as a matter of law based on four basic factual inquiries as set forth in Graham v. John Deere Co. 383_U.S._1 17-18 86_S.Ct._684 15_L.Ed.2d_545_(1966) and elaborated in KSR International Co. v. Teleflex Inc. 550_U.S._398 406-07 127_S.Ct._1727 167_L.Ed.2d_705_(2007) viz. ( 1 ) the scope and content of the prior_art ( 2 ) the level of ordinary_skill in the field of the invention ( 3 ) the differences between the claimed subject matter and the prior_art and ( 4 ) any objective_indicia of unobviousness such as commercial_success or long-felt need or failure of others

The Defendants identified as the closest prior_art European Patent Office Publication No._0_367_895 of the Sandoz company ( `` Sandoz `` ) published May_16,_1990 which describes numerous pyrimidine-based statin compounds including a compound designated as Compound 1b
Compound 1b has two -CH3 ( methyl ) groups on the amino side chain instead of one -CH3 and one -SO2CH3 group as in rosuvastatin
Compound 1b has the following structural formula :

?
The Sandoz_European_application describes Compound 1b as an `` especially preferred embodiment of the invention ''
Sandoz at *9
The Defendants argued in the district_court that this statement suggests that Compound 1b would be a good `` lead_compound '' for further research and that with this selection as lead_compound the change of the -CH3 group to a -SO2CH3 group would have been obvious because it would make Compound 1b more hydrophilic
The Defendants stated that *517 numerous publications taught that liver-selective statins may have fewer undesirable side effects and that hydrophilic statins are more liver-selective
The Defendants argued that persons of ordinary_skill in this field would have been motivated to make Sandoz_Compound 1b more hydrophilic and that the C2_position ( as marked on the molecule supra ) was the logical place to modify Compound 1b because the other parts of the structure were known to be essential to statin activity
The Defendants argued that a person of ordinary_skill would have considered a limited number of common substitutions including a sulfonyl `` spacer '' -SO2-at the C2_position to increase hydrophilicity
The Defendants argued that a person of ordinary_skill would have predicted that this change would produce a statin with fewer adverse side effects thereby rendering the compound obvious
In response the Plaintiffs pointed out that Sandoz_Compound 1b demonstrated unexpected increased toxicity and therefore was not an encouraging lead_compound
The Plaintiffs stated that other compounds in the Sandoz_European_application such as Compound 11 demonstrated better in vitro potency
The Plaintiffs responded to the argument that in 1991 a scientist would have known that Compound 1b should be made more hydrophilic by pointing to publications that state that lipophilic_substituents at the C2_position the converse of hydrophilic can increase statin potency
The Plaintiffs argued that the prior_art provided no suggestion of rosuvastatin 's unexpectedly superior properties as compared with Compound 1b or any other known compound thus creating no `` reasonable_expectation of success ''
Pfizer Inc. v. Apotex Inc. 480_F.3d_1348 1361 ( Fed.Cir.2007 ) ( `` [ T ] he burden falls on the challenger of the patent to show by clear and convincing_evidence that a skilled_artisan would have been motivated to combine the teachings of the prior_art references to achieve the claimed invention and that the skilled_artisan would have had a reasonable_expectation of success in doing so
`` )

The Plaintiffs highlighted the unpredictability that was associated with statin development
For example the pyrrole-based statin corresponding in all other structural aspects to the pyrimidine-based rosuvastatin displayed toxic side effects
The Plaintiffs pointed out that at least five pharmaceutical companies had abandoned their research on statins with pyrimidine cores on the prevailing belief that pyrimidine-based statins were not promising leads to improved products
The Plaintiffs pointed out that no reference or combination of references suggested that the previously unknown molecule rosuvastatin would have its advantageous properties
See KSR 550 U.S. at 421 127_S.Ct._1727 ( `` A factfinder should be aware.. of the distortion caused by hindsight bias and must be cautious of arguments reliant upon ex post reasoning
`` ) ; Yamanouchi Pharm Co. v. Danbury Pharmacal Inc. 231_F.3d_1339 1345 ( Fed.Cir.2000 ) ( finding that `` an ordinary medicinal chemist '' would not have expected the specific chemical structure to have the `` most desirable combination of pharmacological properties '' ) ( internal quotation omitted )
The Plaintiffs pointed to objective_indicia of non-obviousness including commercial_success long felt but unfilled need failure of others and unexpected results Graham 383 U.S. at 17-18 86_S.Ct._684 as support for the district_court 's judgment of unobviousness

The district_court applied the correct standard that the challenger must demonstrate by clear and convincing_evidence that the invention would have been *518 obvious to a person of ordinary_skill in the field of the invention at the time the invention was made
Pfizer 480 F.3d at 1359-60 ( `` Since we must presume a patent valid the patent challenger bears the burden of proving the factual elements of invalidity by clear and convincing_evidence
That burden of proof never shifts to the patentee to prove validity `` )
The district_court discussed the Defendants ' argument that the insertion of a sulfonyl group at position C2 was one of a `` finite number of identified predicable solutions '' to existing problems with statins in the words of KSR 550 U.S. at 421 127_S.Ct._1727 and thus that it would have been obvious to make this specific compound and test its properties
The district_court found that this situation was similar to that discussed in In re O'Farrell 853_F.2d_894_(Fed.Cir.1988) where the court explained that obviousness is not shown when `` what was 'obvious to try ' was to explore a new technology or general approach that seemed to be a promising field of experimentation where the prior_art gave only general guidance as to the particular form of the claimed invention or how to achieve it ''
Id.at 903
The district_court concluded that the Defendants did not demonstrate the required motivation for selecting Sandoz_Compound 1b as a lead_compound or for making this specific sulfonyl change in the Compound 1b molecule
See Eli Lilly & Co. v. Zenith Goldline Pharms. 471_F.3d_1369 1379 ( Fed.Cir.2006 ) ( considering whether a prior_art compound would have been chosen as a lead_compound )

We agree that `` obvious to try '' was negated by the general skepticism concerning pyrimidine-based statins the fact that other pharmaceutical companies had abandoned this general structure and the evidence that the prior_art taught a preference not for hydrophilic substituents but for lipophilic_substituents at the C2_position
See Takeda Chem Indus. Ltd. v. Alphapharm Pty. 492_F.3d_1350 1357 ( Fed.Cir.2007 ) ( `` [ I ] n cases involving new chemical compounds it remains necessary to identify some reason that would have led a chemist to modify a known compound in a particular manner to establish prima facie obviousness of a new claimed compound
`` )

The district_court correctly held that patent invalidity on the ground of obviousness had not been shown for the compound rosuvastatin
That ruling is affirmed
