United States Court of Appeals Federal Circuit
BALLARD MEDICAL PRODUCTS Plaintiff-Appellant v. ALLEGIANCE HEALTHCARE CORP. and Sorenson_Critical_Care Inc. Defendants-Appellees
No._00-1393
| DECIDED : Oct._9,_2001
Synopsis
Patentee brought action against maker of accused device alleging infringement of patents drawn to ventilating and aspirating tracheobronchial_catheters
The United States District Court for the District of Utah Bruce S. Jenkins J. granted summary_judgment of noninfringement and patentee appealed
The Court of Appeals Bryson Circuit_Judge held that : ( 1 ) district_court 's reference to prosecution_history estoppel in connection with literal infringement claim did not warrant reversal ; ( 2 ) valve limitation in patents was limited to vacuum valves with a static internal seal ; and ( 3 ) patent was not infringed

Affirmed

Opinion
BRYSON Circuit_Judge
Ballard Medical Products owns U.S. Patent Nos._4569,344 ( `` the ¡¬344_patent `` ) and 4,696,296 ( `` the ¡¬296_patent `` ) which are drawn to ventilating and aspirating tracheobronchial_catheters
Ballard sued Sorenson_Critical_Care Inc. and Allegiance_Healthcare_Corp. ( collectively `` Sorenson '' ) for infringement of multiple claims of the ¡¬344 and ¡¬296_patent_s. On summary_judgment the district_court ruled that Sorenson had not infringed the disputed patents either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents
We affirm

I
A tracheobronchial catheter of the type at issue in this case performs both ventilation and aspiration of a patient 's breathing passages
During ventilation the catheter pumps air into and out of the patient 's respiratory system
During aspiration the catheter uses vacuum_pressure to evacuate fluids that have accumulated in the patient 's lungs

The two claims that Ballard treats as representative for purposes of appeal are claim 1 of the ¡¬344_patent and claim 4 of the ¡¬296_patent
Claim 1 of the ¡¬344_patent reads as follows in pertinent_part : 1
An indwelling ventilating/aspirating apparatus by which a medical patient is subjected to involuntary_respiratory_therapy and by which fluids from the trachea and/or bronchi are evacuated the apparatus_comprising :

* * * * * * normally closed normally internal sealed and internally sterile vacuum control mechanism sealed against external entry of contamination the vacuum control mechanism comprising valve_means.. the valve_means comprising biased normally closed internal seal means means by which the valve may be selectively manually locked in a closed_position to prohibit inadvertent as well as intentional actuation of the valve_means means by which the valve_means may be selectively manually place [ d ] in an unlocked_closed_position accommodating subsequent selective manual actuation of the valve_means means by which the valve_means are manually displaced from the unlocked_closed_position to an unlocked open_position accommodating aspiration of fluids from the trachea-bronchi of the patient along the catheter_tube and across the valve_means responsive to communication of said vacuum_suction to the distal tip of the catheter_tube as long as the valve_means are manually retained in the open_position counter to the bias imposed upon the biased seal means and means which isolate said vacuum_suction from atmospheric contamination
Claim 4 of the ¡¬296_patent reads as follows in pertinent_part : 4
An indwelling ventilating aspirating apparatus by which a medial patient is subjected to involuntary_respiratory_therapy and by which secretions from *1355 the trachea and/or bronchi are evacuated the apparatus_comprising :

* * * * * * vacuum control valve_structure comprising valve body means having fluid_flow passageway_means and valve_means operable within the valve body means between non-activated and activated positions to respectively prohibit and accommodate vacuum caused fluid_flow along the passageway_means the control valve_structure further comprising ( a ) means biasing the valve_means into the non-activated vacuum prohibiting position ( b ) actuator means for manually displacing the valve_means from the non-activated to the activated position counter to the bias means and the valve_means and thus prevents bacterial contamination within the passageway_means and along the catheter_tube and ( c ) means by which said valve_structure is connected to the other end of the envelope

Figure 1 below which is taken from the ¡¬344 and ¡¬296_patent_s depicts the structure of the Ballard invention that is the subject of the asserted patents :

?
The valve that is the focus of the dispute in this case is labeled 40
The common written description of the ¡¬344 and ¡¬296_patent_s explains that it is important that the valve remain closed during ventilation because suction would interfere with the catheter 's ability to ventilate the patient
Periodically an operator can open the valve manually which introduces vacuum_pressure into the catheter and aspirates the patient 's lungs

Figures 3_and_8 from the ¡¬344 and ¡¬296_patent_s shown below detail the structure of the Ballard valve in the closed and open_positions respectively

*1356. ?
FIG._8
?
When the valve is in the closed_position the actuator 280 and the plunger 286 are in the raised position so that the sealing member 288 which is made of a shape- *1357 retaining highly elastic substance such as synthetic rubber blocks both vacuum_pressure and fluid_flow across the valve_bore 322
To open the valve the operator manually depresses the actuator
Depressing the actuator causes the plunger to stretch the sealing member so that the valve_bore is no longer entirely blocked
Opening the valve_bore introduces vacuum_pressure into the catheter and draws fluid back through the catheter from the patient 's lungs
In the absence of manual pressure the elastic sealing member biases the plunger and actuator to return to the closed_position
To prevent accidental opening of the valve which would cause unintended aspiration the operator can rotate the actuator so that posts 302_and_304 in the actuator align with valve body posts 354_and_356 which prevents the actuator from being depressed

The accused TRACH-EZE device made by defendant Sorenson is shown in the following figure taken from Sorenson 's U.S. Pat
No._5919,174 :

?
In the closed_position the plunger of the Sorenson valve is raised so that valve seal 38 is positioned along plane 49 thus preventing any fluid_flow along passageway 51
In the open_position the plunger is depressed so that seal 38 descends into well 53
Fluid may then flow through passageway 51 around the shaft of the plunger
O-ring seal 37 impedes the flow of fluid up into the valve mechanism
While the valve is in the closed_position the cap 15 may be rotated to a position that prevents depression of the plunger thus locking the valve in the closed_position

Ballard filed suit against the defendants alleging infringement of claims 1-BIG_TOKEN__20_and_26__BIG_TOKEN of the ¡¬344_patent and claims 4-6 of the *1358 ¡¬296_patent
The district_court held an extended pretrial conference at which summary_judgment and claim construction issues were considered
Subsequently the court issued an order granting Sorenson 's motion for summary_judgment of noninfringement
The court based its ruling on materials the patentee submitted to the Patent and Trademark Office ( `` PTO '' ) during the prosecution of the ¡¬344_patent distinguishing the valve of the claimed catheter from various prior art devices
Those statements the court concluded required that the ¡¬344 and ¡¬296_patent_s be construed to exclude catheter systems having a valve_structure of the sort used in the accused Sorenson device
The court also concluded that prosecution_history estoppel foreclosed Ballard from establishing infringement based on the doctrine of equivalents
