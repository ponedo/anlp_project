No._96-1178
| Sept._17,_1997
Synopsis
Assignee of patent for bowling_lane_maintenance_machine and its exclusive_licensee brought infringement action against competitor
Competitor counterclaimed alleging that patent was invalid
The United_States_District_Court for the Western_District of Missouri Bartlett Chief_Judge entered judgment in favor of plaintiffs and competitor appealed
The Court of Appeals Schall Circuit_Judge held that : ( 1 ) competitor 's machine infringed patent because claim for maintenance_assembly did not encompass function of control assembly ; ( 2 ) patent_claim was not anticipated by prior art machine ; and ( 3 ) patent_claim was not obvious

Opinion
SCHALL Circuit_Judge
The Kegel_Company Inc. is the assignee of U.S. Patent No._5191,290 entitled `` Bowling Lane Maintenance Machine '' ( the '290_patent )
DBA_Products_Company Inc. is the exclusive_licensee under the '290_patent
( We refer to the Kegel_Company and DBA_Products_Company collectively as `` Kegel '' )
Kegel sued AMF_Bowling Inc. ( `` AMF '' ) in the United_States_District_Court for the Western_District of Missouri for infringement of the '290_patent
AMF denied infringement and counterclaimed that the patent was invalid
In response to cross-motions for summary judgment the district court held the '290_patent not invalid held that it was infringed by AMF and entered judgment of liability accordingly
Kegel Co. v. AMF_Bowling Inc. No._93-0095- CV-W-9 ( W.D.Mo.1995 )
AMF now appeals
We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1292 ( c ) ( 2 ) ( 1994 )
We affirm

BACKGROUND
I
The '290_patent is directed to various improvements in a bowling_lane_maintenance_machine
Such machines are used to maintain the condition of bowling_lanes by applying thin layers of conditioning_oil onto the surfaces of the lanes
The conditioning_oil or `` lane dressing fluid '' protects the wooden surface of the bowling_lane from wear caused by friction ; the conditioning_oil also influences how a bowling ball travels down the lane

The American Bowling Congress enacts rules which specify how to apply conditioning_oil to achieve a favored `` lane_profile ''
Since 1991 bowling_lane operators have followed the `` top hat rule '' which specifies a lane_profile characterized by light volumes of oil deposited along the outside edges of the lane and heavier volumes of oil in the center of the lane
Heavier application of conditioning_oil in the center of the lane can result in higher bowling scores

A bowling_lane_maintenance_machine can automatically travel the length of a bowling_lane
As it moves down the lane it transfers conditioning_oil from a storage_tank to a buffer which then applies the oil to the lane surface
The transfer of oil from the storage_tank to the buffer typically is accomplished by means of a transfer_roller

The '290_patent discloses a bowling_lane_maintenance_machine which enables a bowling_lane operator to vary the application of conditioning_oil as the maintenance machine travels down the lane
In this way the operator is able to achieve a variety of lane_profiles to suit different bowling events
The claimed machine essentially consists of three parts : a maintenance_assembly by means of which conditioning_oil is applied to the surface of the bowling_lane ; a propulsion_mechanism which moves the machine down the lane ; and a controller which controls the maintenance_assembly and the propulsion_mechanism
'290_patent col. 1 lines 43-50
It is the maintenance_assembly that is at issue in this case
Figure 9 of the '290_patent illustrates in sectional view the structure of that assembly :

The storage_tank or lane dressing reservoir 40 contains conditioning_oil
Six shiftable wick assemblies 46a46f extend along the length of the tank
'290_patent col. 2 line 62-col. 3 line 3
( Only wick assembly 46b is shown in Figure 9 )
One end of each wick sits within the storage_tank
The other end is above the tank in close proximity to the transfer_roller 50
'290_patent col. 3 lines 9-19
Attached to each wick through a cable is a solenoid.1 ( Figure 9 shows solenoid S2 )
When activated by the controller which is not shown in Figure 9 a solenoid shifts its corresponding wick through a cable so that the wick is engaged or disengaged from the transfer_roller
The transfer_roller is positioned against the buffer 48
'290_patent col. 2 line 62-col. 3 line 3
Thus when a solenoid is activated and shifts its wick to engage the transfer_roller conditioning_oil_moves from the storage_tank through the wick onto the roller
From the transfer_roller the oil_moves to the buffer which applies the oil to the surface of the bowling_lane
The controller is programmed to activate individual solenoids separately to achieve any desired bowling_lane_profile

The '290_patent issued on January 26 1993
It has 18 claims three of which ( nos._1 7 and 14 ) are in independent form
Claim 7 is representative ; it reads as follows : 7
In a bowling_lane_maintenance_machine for applying a lane dressing to the surface of a bowling_lane the improvement comprising : a maintenance_assembly comprising means for storing lane dressing a rotatable buffer_means for applying the lane dressing to the bowling_lane and transfer means for transferring lane dressing from said storage_means to said buffer_means said transfer means including a transfer_roller and a plurality of transversely arrayed wicks each wick having one end positioned in fluidic engagement with said storage_means and an opposed end selectively shiftable between a first_position in engagement with said transfer_roller for transferring lane dressing to said buffer_means and a second_position disengaged from said transfer_roller for avoiding the transfer of lane dressing to said buffer_means *1424 said transfer means further including means for selectively and independently shifting each of said wicks between said first_position and said second_position
