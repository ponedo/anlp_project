BACKGROUND
The patent in this case relates to breadmaking
Oxidizing agents are used during the breadmaking_process to strengthen dough increase loaf volume contribute to fine crumb grain and increase shelf life
Since the early 1900 's potassium_bromate was widely used as a slow-acting oxidant to improve the quality of bread
However by the 1990 's there was growing concern about the carcinogenic effects of potassium_bromate and the Food and Drug Administration encouraged the baking industry to seek suitable alternatives
Kim a food chemist believed that a combination of ascorbic acid and food_acid would serve as a suitable alternative to potassium_bromate in the breadmaking_process and applied for a patent on that composition
On April_23,_1996 Kim obtained U.S. Patent No._5510,129 for a potassium_bromate_replacer_composition
However a few weeks later Kim surrendered that patent to the Patent and Trademark Office ( `` PTO '' ) and filed a reissue_application alleging that an error had arisen during prosecution
After prosecution of her reissue_application Kim obtained the ¡¬355 reissue patent on October 26 1999

On April_9,_2001 Kim filed suit against ConAgra alleging that ConAgra induced the infringement of independent_claims 5_and_10 of the reissued ¡¬355_patent1 Claims 5_and_10 were newly added during prosecution of the reissue_application
The accused conduct was that ConAgra required licensees of its `` Healthy_ChoiceTHE_R '' brand name to use recipes provided by ConAgra
Kim alleged that the Healthy_ChoiceTHE_R Natural Wheat product infringed claim 5 and that the Healthy_ChoiceTHE_R 7-Grain and Whole_Grain_products infringed claim 10.2 ConAgra stipulated *1317 that the bread recipes used in the accused products included ascorbic acid and food_acid in the ranges specified in claims 5_and_10 of the ¡¬355_patent
Claim 10 differs from claim 5 in that it contains the additional limitation of yeast

On June_30,_2003 ConAgra filed a counterclaim for a declaratory_judgment of invalidity and noninfringement of the ¡¬355_patent3 On November 10 2003 ConAgra moved for summary judgment of invalidity based on the recapture rule
On March_26,_2004 the district_court ( Judge William T. Hart ) denied ConAgra 's motion
The case then proceeded to trial
After each party 's case-in-chief the opposing party moved for judgment as a matter of law ( `` JMOL '' ) under Rule 50 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the district_court reserved ruling on both motions
On October 13 2004 a jury found that the asserted claims of the ¡¬355_patent were not invalid ; that ConAgra had induced infringement of claim 10 with the licensing of its Healthy Choice THE_R 7-Grain and Whole_Grain_products but that the inducement was not willful ; and that claim 5 and the dependent_claims were not infringed
ConAgra renewed its motion for JMOL arguing invalidity and noninfringement
On April_28,_2005 the district_court partially granted ConAgra 's motion for JMOL finding that the ¡¬355_patent was not invalid but that claim 10 was not infringed
The district_court entered final_judgment on April_28,_2005 finding the ¡¬355_patent not infringed and not invalid

Kim timely appealed the judgment of noninfringement and ConAgra_cross-appealed the judgment that the claims were not invalid
We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( 2000 )
