United States Court of Appeals Federal Circuit
DSW INC. and DSW_Shoe_Warehouse Inc. Plaintiffs-Appellants v. SHOE PAVILION INC. Defendant-Appellee
No._2008-1085
| Aug._19,_2008
Synopsis
Background : Patent owner filed action against competitor alleging infringement of patent that taught system and method for storing and displaying large_stock of footwear for customer_self-service
The United_States_District_Court for the Central_District of California Florence-Marie Cooper J. granted judgment for competitor
Owner appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Mayer Circuit_Judge held that :

trial_court could not import limitations from apparatus and system claims into method_claims ;

phrase `` horizontally movably positionable stack divider '' meant that vertically disposed stack dividers had to be capable of being moved into different horizontal positions in footwear_display ;

word `` also '' from patent examiner 's statement that `` prior_art also does not teach a method of displaying 1st and 2nd footwear styles '' did not imply that latter-discussed method_claims depended on previously-discussed apparatus claims ;

display_method had not been constrained by track and roller limitation ;

preferred_embodiment that included rolling track mechanism did not constrain display_method ; and

reasonable_steps and good faith efforts by competitor to bring its infringing_activity to timely end did not eliminate competitor 's liability for damages to owner for infringement that occurred subsequent to receipt of actual notice of patent

Vacated and remanded

Before MAYER SCHALL and LINN Circuit_Judges
Opinion
MAYER Circuit_Judge DSW Inc. and DSW_Shoe_Warehouse Inc. ( together `` DSW '' ) appeal the judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the Central_District of California granting summary_judgment of non-infringement of U.S. Patent No._6948,622 ( `` ¡¬622_patent `` ) in favor of Shoe_Pavilion Inc. ( `` Shoe_Pavilion '' ) and summary_judgment of no liability for damages for past infringement of U.S. Patent No
D 495,172 ( `` ¡¬172_patent `` ) and the ¡¬622_patent also in favor of Shoe_Pavilion DSW Inc. v. Shoe_Pavilion Inc. No._2 :06-CV-06854-FMC-SHx ( C.D.Cal
Sept._25,_2007 ) ( `` Summary_Judgment_Order '' )
Because the trial_court erred by ( 1 ) construing claims 4-6 of the ¡¬622_patent to include the track and roller configuration limitation recited in claims 1-3 and ( 2 ) misapplying Wine Railway Appliance Co. v. Enterprise Railway Equipment 297_U.S._387 56_S.Ct._528 80_L.Ed._736_(1936) with respect to damages we vacate and remand

Background
DSW owns the ¡¬622_patent which teaches a system and method for storing and displaying a large_stock of footwear for customer_self-service
DSW also owns the ¡¬172_patent which claims an ornamental design for a combined product display and stacked product container separator
On May_19,_2006 DSW notified Shoe_Pavilion that the then-current shoe display design ( `` First_Design '' ) in five of its stores infringed DSW 's ¡¬622 and ¡¬172_patent s. Shoe_Pavilion responded to the notice and agreed to modify its First_Design to avoid infringement
Within seven months of DSW 's notification of infringement Shoe_Pavilion removed all First_Design displays from its stores and replaced them with a modified design ( `` New_Design '' )

On October 27 2006 DSW filed suit against Shoe_Pavilion for patent infringement alleging that Shoe_Pavilion 's manufacture and use of its New_Design_footwear_displays in seven of its California stores also infringed claims 4-6 of the ¡¬622_patent and that Shoe_Pavilion owed damages for infringement of the ¡¬172 and ¡¬622_patent s by the First_Design
Shoe_Pavilion moved for summary_judgment that its New_Design_footwear_displays did not infringe or in the alternative that the ¡¬622_patent is invalid and that it owed no damages for infringement by the First_Design

With respect to infringement by the New_Design the parties ' dispute turned on whether the language in claims 4-61 of the *1345 ¡¬622_patent encompasses only methods of displaying and storing footwear that contain track and roller mechanisms connecting display modules to a support base as described in claims 1-32 ( the `` Track and Roller_Limitation '' )
DSW argued that the trial_court erred by impermissibly construing claims 4-6 to contain the Track and Roller_Limitation notwithstanding the conspicuous absence of claim language evincing such a limitation
Shoe_Pavilion argued that DSW disclaimed from the scope of the ¡¬622_patent any apparatus method or system that does not include a track and roller mechanism in the display module
First the original application 's *1346 independent_claims which did not include the Track and Roller_Limitation were rejected as reading on the prior_art or as obvious under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103 ( a ) and were cancelled
Second the application 's dependent claims already containing inter alia the Track and Roller_Limitation were objected to for relying on the rejected independent_claims and were only approved after being amended to read as independent_claims
These amended claims issued as independent_claims 1-3 of the ¡¬622_patent
DSW simultaneously added new application claims 15-21 which issued as claims 4-10 of the ¡¬622_patent

Relying on the specification and the prosecution history the trial_court agreed with Shoe_Pavilion that method_claims 4-6 were not independent and separately patentable from claims 1-3
Specifically it found that ( 1 ) the examiner 's reasons for allowance indicated that the Track and Roller_Limitation was the seminal feature distinguishing the ¡¬622_patent over the prior_art ( 2 ) claims 4-6 would be invalid as indefinite without the limitation and ( 3 ) the specification describes the invention as a modular footwear_display and storage system and claims 1-3 recite a footwear_display and stack divider module connected by a module support member containing the Track and Roller_Limitation
The court also noted that the preferred_embodiment explicitly includes the Track and Roller_Limitation
Accordingly the court construed claims 4-6 to include a footwear_display module with vertically disposed horizontally moveable dividers coextensive with the Track and Roller_Limitation described in claims 1-3 and concluded that because Shoe_Pavilion 's New_Design lacked the rolling connection element it did not infringe the ¡¬622_patent
It granted summary_judgment of non-infringement in favor of Shoe_Pavilion

With respect to damages the district court found that DSW was not entitled to any damages as a matter of law because immediately upon receipt of DSW 's notice of infringement of the ¡¬172 and ¡¬622_patent s by the First_Design Shoe_Pavilion took reasonable_steps and timely removed all of the infringing shoe displays
Citing Wine Railway the trial_court granted summary_judgment to Shoe_Pavilion and stated that no damages for infringement are recoverable by a plaintiff unless the infringing_activity continues after notice is provided to the infringer

DSW appeals the trial_court 's Summary_Judgment_Order with respect to Shoe_Pavilion 's infringement of the ¡¬622_patent by the New_Design and liability for damages for infringement by the First_Design
We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
