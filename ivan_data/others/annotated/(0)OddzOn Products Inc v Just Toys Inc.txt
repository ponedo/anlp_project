Opinion
LOURIE Circuit_Judge
OddzOn Products Inc. appeals from the decision of the United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of California granting summary_judgment in favor of defendants Just_Toys Inc. Lisco Inc. and Spalding & Evenflo_Companies Inc. ( collectively `` Just_Toys '' ) on OddzOn 's claims of design_patent_infringement trade_dress_infringement and state-law_unfair_competition
Just_Toys cross-appeals from the decision granting summary_judgment in favor of the patentee OddzOn on Just_Toys ' claim of patent_invalidity
OddzOn Prods. Inc. v. Just_Toys Inc. No._95- CV-1077 ( N.D.Cal
July_29,_1996 )
Because OddzOn has failed to demonstrate that a reasonable_jury could find that Just_Toys ' tossing balls infringe OddzOn 's design_patent or protectable trade_dress and derivatively that there was unfair competition we affirm the district_court 's judgment in favor of the defendant Just_Toys
Because no reasonable_jury could conclude other than that the patented_design is ornamental novel and nonobvious we affirm the district_court 's judgment that the patent was not proved invalid

BACKGROUND
OddzOn is a toy and sporting goods_company that sells the popular `` Vortex '' tossing ball a foam football-shaped ball with a tail and fin structure
The Vortex_ball is OddzOn 's commercial embodiment of its design_patent U.S. Patent D 346,001 which issued on April_12,_1994
Figure 1 of the patent is shown below :

Just_Toys Inc. another toy and sporting goods_company sells a competing line of `` Ultra Pass '' balls
Two versions of the allegedly infringing Ultra Pass balls are shown below :

*1400. ?
-- -- -

OddzOn sued Just_Toys for design_patent_infringement trade_dress_infringement and state-law_unfair_competition asserting that the Ultra Pass line of tossing balls was likely to be confused with OddzOn 's Vortex_ball and that the Ultra Pass packaging was likely to be confused with the Vortex packaging
Just_Toys denied infringement and asserted that the patent was invalid
On cross-motions for summary_judgment the district_court held that the patent was not shown to be invalid and was not infringed
The court also held that Just_Toys did not infringe OddzOn 's trade_dress

The district_court determined that two confidential_designs* that had been disclosed to the inventor qualified as subject matter encompassed within the meaning of 35 U.S.C.¡± 102 ( f ) ( 1994 ) and concluded that these designs could be combined with other prior_art designs for purposes of a challenge to the validity of the patent under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103 ( 1994 )
Nonetheless the district_court held that the patented_design would not have been obvious in light of the prior_art including the two confidential_designs
The court construed the single claim of the patent as being directed to the design for :

a ball shaped like a football with a slender straight tailshaft projecting from the rear of the football
In addition the '001_Patent design has three fins symmetrically arranged around the tailshaft each of which has a gentle curve up and outward which creates a fin with a larger surface area at the end furthest from the ball
The fins flare outwardly along the entire length of the tailshaft with the front end of the fin extending slightly up along the side of the football so that the fins seemingly protrude from the inside of the football
After construing the claim the court held that the patented_design was not dictated solely by function and thus that it was not invalid on that ground
It also held that OddzOn failed to present sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable_jury to find infringement
The district_court considered OddzOn 's proffered consumer survey evidence of similarity but held that it was not probative on the question whether the accused balls were substantially similar to the patented_design in terms of its protectable features i.e. its ornamental_features
The district_court concluded that the survey evidence demonstrated nothing more than that any ball with a tail and fins regardless of its ornamental_features would appear to be similar to the patented_design

The court found that OddzOn 's proffered testimony from an expert was also not probative of any similarity between the ornamental_features of the accused balls and the patented_design
It noted that the bases for the expert 's conclusion of similarity were unclear and that the legal standards applied to reach that conclusion were not apparent
The court excluded evidence of `` actual confusion '' stating that there was no basis to determine that the mistaken return of twenty-one of the *1401 accused balls to OddzOn would not have been typical in the industry absent `` confusion ''
Furthermore it stated that there was no way of determining whether the ornamental_features caused the `` confusion ''

The district_court also held that the accused balls and their packaging did not violate OddzOn 's protectable trade_dress rights
Holding that OddzOn 's evidence was not probative of consumer confusion regarding the source of the accused balls the court granted Just_Toys ' motion for summary_judgment
Because the court found no likelihood of confusion it did not reach the issues of inherent distinctiveness or secondary meaning
Finally determining that California 's unfair competition law is `` substantially congruent '' to trademark infringement law the question being whether there is a likelihood of confusion with regard to source the court ruled that OddzOn 's state-law claim must fall with its federal trade_dress claims
OddzOn appeals and Just_Toys cross-appeals the grant of the respective summary_judgment motions
