Opinion
LOURIE Circuit_Judge
These consolidated appeals stem from two related patent infringement actions brought in the United_States_District_Court for the Middle_District of Florida by Voter_Verified Inc. ( `` Voter_Verified '' ) against Premier_Election_Solutions Inc. ( `` Premier '' ) Diebold Inc. ( `` Diebold '' ) and Election_Systems & Software Inc. ( `` Election_Systems '' ) ( collectively `` Defendants '' ) in which Voter_Verified alleged infringement of claims 1-94 of U.S. Reissue Patent RE40 449 ( the `` ¡¬449_patent `` )1 As the respective appellate briefs are virtually identical we consider the cases together

On summary_judgment the district_court held claims 1-93 not infringed and invalidated claims 49_and_94 but the court also dismissed the Defendants ' counterclaim that claims 85_and_93 are invalid and held that claims 1-48 50-84 and 86-92 are not invalid.2 Voter_Verified Inc. v. Premier_Election_Solutions Inc. No._6 :09-cv-1968 ( M.D.Fla
Aug._31,_2011 ) ( Final_Judgment ) ECF No._251 ; Voter_Verified Inc. v. Election Sys
& Software Inc. No._6 :09-cv-1969 ( M.D.Fla
Sept._1,_2011 ) ( Final_Judgment ) ECF No._197
On appeal Voter_Verified challenges a large number of the district_court 's rulings including its judgments in favor of the Defendants on infringement and invalidity while Premier and Election_Systems cross-appeal as to the validity of the surviving claims of the ¡¬449_patent
For the reasons that follow we affirm

BACKGROUND
The ¡¬449_patent assigned to Voter_Verified issued on August 5 2008 and claims priority from an application filed on December 7 2000
The patent discloses and claims automated systems and methods for voting in an election featuring a self-verification procedure by which `` machine and human error may be detected and corrected before the ballot is submitted by the voter for tabulation ''
¡¬449_patent col. 3_ll._9 -11
Briefly the voter enters a vote into an electronic voting_station which temporarily records the voter 's input in digital storage and generates a corresponding printed ballot
That printed ballot is then checked for accuracy either by presentation to the voter for visual inspection or by a computerized scanning mechanism capable of comparing the face of the printed ballot with the vote data represented in the station 's temporary storage
In either case only ballots deemed consistent with the voter 's intended or recorded input are accepted for final tabulation
See id
col. 2_ll._22 -40
Independent claims 1 25 56 and 94 recite such `` self-verifying '' voting_systems and independent claims 49 85 *BIG_TOKEN__1378_and_93__BIG_TOKEN recite closely related voting methods
For example claims 1_and_49 read : 1
A self-verifying voting system comprising : one or more_voting_stations comprising : ( a ) one or more computer_programs which operate in a computer to display general voting instructions at least one election_ballot showing the candidates and issues to be voted on and directions to the voter for operation of the system ; present the election_ballot for voting and input of votes by the voter ; accept input of the votes from the voter ; print out the election_ballot according to which the voter voted with the votes of the voter printed thereon so that the votes of the voter are readable on said election_ballot by the voter and readable by a tabulating machine ; record the votes in the computer ; and
compare the votes read by a ballot scanning machine with the votes recorded in the computer ; ( b ) a computer with at least one display device at least one device to accept voting input from a voter at least one data storage device and sufficient memory to provide for the operation of said computer_program in which said computer_program runs ; ( c ) a printer connected to said computer for printing the election_ballot according to which the voter voted ; ( d ) a ballot scanning means for reading the votes on the printed ballot printed according to the election_ballot which the voter voted so that the votes shown on the printed ballot are compared by the computer_program with the votes recorded in the computer for the voter ; ( e ) means for connecting said ballot scanning means to said computer ; and
a means for tabulating the printed ballots generated by said one or more_voting_stations

col. 6_ll._18 -52
49
A method of voting providing for self-verification of a ballot comprising the steps of : ( a ) voting by a voter using a computer voting_station programmed to present an election_ballot accept input of votes from the voter according to the election_ballot temporarily store the votes of the voter ; ( b ) printing of the votes of the voter from the votes temporarily stored in the computer for the voting_station ; ( c ) comparison by the voter of the printed votes with the votes temporarily stored in the computer for the voting_station ; ( d ) decision by the voter as to whether a printed ballot is acceptable or unacceptable ; ( e ) inputting of information as to the acceptability of a printed ballot by the voter ; and
( f ) submission of an acceptable printed ballot for tabulation

The Defendants produce and market automated voting_systems
In November *1379 2009 Voter_Verified filed two nearly identical infringement complaints based on the ¡¬449_patent one directed at Premier and Diebold and the other targeting Election_Systems
The Defendants denied infringement and sought declaratory judgments of invalidity on various grounds including anticipation obviousness and indefiniteness

In a series of summary_judgment orders the district_court held that the Defendants had not infringed claims 1-93
In addition the court concluded that claim 94 was invalid as indefinite under 35 U.S.C.¡± 112 ?
2 and that claim 49 was invalid as obvious under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103 in view of an article ( the `` Benson article '' ) obtained from an online periodical concerned with computer safety and security known as the Risks Digest
The district_court entered summary_judgment against Premier and Election_Systems however on their invalidity counterclaims regarding claims 1-48 50-84 and 86-92 holding that they had `` fail [ ed ] to present any argument or evidence regarding the invalidity of these claims '' and therefore could not satisfy their burden of establishing invalidity by clear and convincing evidence
Finally the district_court dismissed without prejudice Diebold 's invalidity counterclaims as to claims 1-BIG_TOKEN__48_and_50__BIG_TOKEN -93 as well as Premier and Election_Systems ' invalidity counterclaims regarding claims 85_and_93

Voter_Verified appeals on numerous grounds including the judgments of noninfringement and invalidity and both Premier and Election_Systems cross-appeal regarding the validity of claims 1-48 50-84 and 86-92
We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
