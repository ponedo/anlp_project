BACKGROUND
I. Glaucoma is an eye disease associated with elevated intraocular pressure ( `` IOP '' )
Treatments that effectively reduce IOP can slow the progression of the disease
If left untreated however elevated IOP can damage the optic nerve and lead to permanent vision loss and blindness
In 2001 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( the `` FDA '' ) approved LumiganTHE_R 0.03 % ( `` Lumigan 0.03 % '' ) a once-daily topical solution developed by Allergan for treating open angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension
Lumigan 0.03 % contains 0.03 % by weight of bimatoprost and 50 parts per million ( `` ppm '' ) benzalkonium chloride ( `` BAK '' ) among other ingredients

Bimatoprost the active ingredient in Lumigan 0.03 % is a prostaglandin analog that effectively lowers IOP but can cause hyperemia i.e. red eye when administered to the ocular_surface
One structural difference between bimatoprost and two other prostaglandin analogs that were approved for treating glaucoma at the time of its approval XalatanTHE_R ( latanoprost ) and TravatanTHE_R ( travoprost ) is that bimatoprost contains an amide instead of an ester as in latanoprost and travoprost
Opinion at 7-8
It was understood that both latanoprost and travoprost but not bimatoprost act as prodrugs of the corresponding acids
Id

BAK is a preservative for inhibiting bacterial growth in ophthalmic solutions
It was known however that BAK is cytotoxic and that it can damage the cells on the ocular_surface and cause undesirable side effects

Although Lumigan 0.03 % was effective at lowering IOP it also caused frequent and severe_hyperemia
Many patients thus stopped using it without consulting their physicians which led to gradual vision loss
To address that problem Allergan explored a number of alternative formulations of bimatoprost and surprisingly discovered that increasing the concentration of BAK from 50 ppm to 200 ppm significantly increased the corneal permeability of bimatoprost
Id.at 12-13
After further research Allergan developed LumiganTHE_R 0.01 % ( `` Lumigan 0.01 % '' )

Lumigan 0.01 % is a topical solution containing 0.01 % bimatoprost and 200 ppm BAK ; otherwise it has the same ingredients as Lumigan 0.03 %
Thus as compared with Lumigan 0.03 % Lumigan 0.01 % has a three-fold lower bimatoprost concentration *1299 and a four-fold higher BAK concentration
Clinical studies showed that Lumigan 0.01 % has similar efficacy to Lumigan 0.03 % viz. IOP-lowering within 0.5 mmHg of that of Lumigan 0.03 % but it causes less frequent and severe_hyperemia than Lumigan 0.03 %
Id.at 20-21
In 2010 the FDA approved Allergan 's New Drug Application for Lumigan 0.01 % for the same approved uses as Lumigan 0.03 %
