Opinion
CLEVENGER Circuit_Judge
Plaintiff-Appellee National_Steel_Car Ltd. ( `` National_Steel_Car '' or `` NSC '' ) sued Defendants-Appellants Canadian_Pacific Railway Ltd. Canadian_Pacific_Railway_Company 3942503 Canada Inc. and Delaware *1322 and Hudson_Railway_Company Inc. ( collectively `` Canadian_Pacific '' or `` CPR '' ) in the Eastern_District of Pennsylvania for infringement of U.S. Patent No._4951,575 ( `` the ¡¬575_patent `` )
NSC moved for a preliminary_injunction and the district_court granted NSC 's motion holding inter alia that NSC had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits that CPR 's defense to infringement under 35 U.S.C.¡± 272 lacked substantial merit and that CPR 's invalidity defense did not raise a substantial_question
See Nat ' l Steel Car Ltd. v. Canadian Pac
Ry. Ltd. 254_F.Supp.2d_527 ( E.D.Pa.2003 )
After careful review of the district_court 's opinion the record and the arguments advanced by the parties we conclude that CPR 's defenses demonstrate substantial challenges to NSC 's allegations and we reverse the district_court 's preliminary_injunction

I
The ¡¬575_patent assigned to National_Steel_Car a manufacturer of railway cars addresses a particular type of railway car used to haul lumber : a depressed center-beam_flat_car
Figure 1 of the ¡¬575_patent shows a longitudinal section through one side of the car and is reproduced below

?
The car described in the ¡¬575_patent is a `` center-beam '' car because the primary structure of the car is a truss-like beam element that runs the length of the center of the car between the wheel assemblies or `` end_truck_assemblies '' in the front and back of the car
Center-beam_cars are an industry standard for hauling lumber which is piled onto a floor that extends laterally to each side of the car from the bottom of the center_beam and then secured to the center_beam
Canadian_Pacific currently operates a fleet of center-beam_flat_cars

The car described in the ¡¬575_patent is a `` depressed '' or `` drop-deck '' car because the portion of the floor between the end_truck_assemblies is lowered relative to the height of the floor over the end_truck_assemblies
The drop-deck center-beam_flat_car has two advantages over the non-drop-deck version
First it can carry a volumetrically larger load
Given the relatively low density of wood ordinary center-beam_cars reach volume capacity before they reach weight capacity leaving each car inefficiently under-loaded in terms of weight
Second the dropping of the deck lowers the car 's center of the gravity permitting safer loading transit and unloading because a higher center of gravity renders the car more vulnerable to tipping

NSC alleges infringement of claims 1-3 5-9 and 20-23 of the ¡¬575_patent
Claims 1 2_and_20 are independent claims each using different structural aspects of the invention to define the claim 's scope
Because the district_court construed only a limited number of claim_terms and based its invalidity conclusion on only those terms we need not reproduce an exhaustive list of the asserted claims
Claims 1 *BIG_TOKEN__1323_and_5__BIG_TOKEN are thus representative and the construed claim_terms are emphasized : 1
A flat_car supported on end_truck_assemblies comprising
a body formed by a longitudinally extending center_sill a draft sill attached to each end of said center_sill and a pair of bulkheads mounted at each end side_sill means disposed on opposite_sides of said center_sill on said body a vertical_center_beam_assembly extending upward from said center_sill said vertical_center_beam_assembly including an upper_center_sill extending parallel above said center_sill between said bulkheads said upper_center_sill being supported by a plurality of columns carried by at least said center_sill and
floor means being arranged between said opposite side_sill means said floor means having end floor sections lying in a first generally horizontal_plane and an intermediate_depressed_floor_section disposed in a second generally horizontal_plane lying below said first horizontal_plane said side_sill means includes a pair of side_sill_assemblies disposed on opposite_sides of said center_sill each of said side_sill_assemblies includes a pair of upper end sections extending along an upper axis and an intermediate_section extending along a lower axis disposed below said first axis for supporting said intermediate_depressed_floor_section
5
The flat_car according to claim 1 wherein said side_sill means includes side_sill transition means for joining said end sections of each of said side_sill_assemblies to said intermediate_section
