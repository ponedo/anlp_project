*1314*1317 This case arises under the Hatch-Waxman Act
Appellees UCB Inc. ; UCB_BioPharma_SPRL ; Research Corp. Technologies Inc. ; and Harris FRC Corp. ( collectively `` UCB '' ) own and/or license U.S. Patent No
RE38,551
The '551_patent covers lacosamide an anti-epileptic drug which treats epilepsy and other central nervous system disorders
UCB holds New Drug Applications ( `` NDAs '' ) that cover its lacosamide anti-epileptic drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration ( `` FDA '' ) and marketed under the tradename VimpatTHE_R
The '551_patent is listed in the FDA 's Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations ( `` Orange Book '' ) as covering VimpatTHE_R

Appellants are generic_drug_manufacturers who filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications ( `` ANDAs '' ) seeking approval for generic versions of VimpatTHE_R
Pursuant to the governing Hatch-Waxman provisions Appellants certified in their ANDAs that the '551_patent is invalid unenforceable or that their proposed generic_lacosamide_products will not infringe the '551_patent
Consequently UCB sued Appellants for patent infringement in the United_States_District_Court for the District of Delaware
Appellants stipulated to infringement of claims 9 10 and 13 of the '551_patent but maintained that these claims are invalid for obviousness-type_double_patenting obviousness and anticipation

Following a bench_trial the district_court made exhaustive fact findings based on the trial evidence and concluded that the asserted claims of the '551_patent are not invalid
Appellants appeal that decision arguing that the district_court misapplied the legal standards for obviousness-type_double_patenting obviousness and anticipation and that the prior_art anticipates and/or renders the '551_patent obvious

As explained more fully below we hold that the district_court applied the correct legal standards in its obviousness-type_double_patenting obviousness and anticipation analyses
And because we discern no clear error in its underlying fact findings we affirm the district_court 's ultimate conclusion that the asserted claims are not invalid

*1318BACKGROUND
A
The '551_patent discloses and claims lacosamide the active ingredient in VimpatTHE_R
Lacosamide belongs to a class of compounds known as functionalized amino acids ( `` FAAs '' ) having the following general structure : ?

The R R1 and R3_positions are variables representing the many different chemical groups that can be placed at each position resulting in a vast number of possible FAA compounds
These groups may be aromatic heteroaromatic or nonaromatic
Aromatic groups have a two-dimensional structure typically organized into rings such as benzene
Heteroaromatic groups such as oxygen or nitrogen are also aromatic but contain at least one heteroatom i.e. any atom other than carbon
Nonaromatic groups have three-dimensional structures and are not organized into rings

As disclosed in the '551_patent lacosamide is the R-enantiomer of N-benzyl-2-acetamido-3-methoxypropion-amide
SeeBIG_TOKEN__'551_patent__BIG_TOKEN col. 3_ll._65 -67 col. 38_ll._9 -40
Enantiomers a type of stereoisomers are compounds that have the same chemical structure-i.e. the same atoms are connected to each other in the same way-but differ in orientation in three-dimensional space
These orientations are designated as either `` R '' or `` S. '' A 50-50 mixture of two enantiomers is known as a `` racemate '' or `` racemic_mixture ''

For its R R1 and R3_positions lacosamide has an unsubstituted_benzyl at R an unsubstituted_methyl at R1 and a nonaromatic methoxymethyl at R3
The specification teaches that `` the R stereoisomer is unexpectedly more potent than the corresponding S stereoisomer and the racemic_mixture ''
Id
col. 23_ll._31 -33

As of the March 1996 effective filing date of the '551_patent no FAA had been approved as an anti-epileptic drug nor had any FAA advanced to clinical trials
Also prior to the '551_patent there was no public disclosure of pharmacological efficacy or safety data to support the use of any FAA as an anti-epileptic or anticonvulsant drug
To date VimpatTHE_R remains the only approved FAA for the treatment of epilepsy

The development of FAAs as anticonvulsants began in the 1980s with the inventor of the '551_patent Dr._Kohn
In 1985 Dr._Kohn first disclosed the anticonvulsant_activity of a compound identified as `` AAB '' which provided the proof of concept for the use of FAAs as anti-epileptic drugs
In 1987 Dr._Kohn published a paper ( `` Kohn 1987 '' ) which disclosed the anticonvulsant_activity of different structural analogs of the parent AAB compound
Kohn 1987 reported results of different groups at each of the different R positions of the general FAA chemical structure
Kohn 1987 showed that the placement of an aromatic group at the R3_position showed improved anticonvulsant_activity
Relevant to the issues here the compounds studied in Kohn 1987 used an unsubstituted_benzyl at R and an unsubstituted_methyl at R1
A substituted molecule replaces one of the hydrogen *1319 atoms of the parent molecule with another atom or structure

In 1988 Dr._Kohn also reported data on the racemate and individual enantiomers of AAB and APB ( a similar compound to AAB except that it contained a phenyl group at R3 )
This data showed that the R enantiomers of AAB and APB were 10 times more potent than their S_enantiomers
In 1990 this was confirmed by Dr._Kohn in a study ( `` Kohn 1990 '' ) in which he concluded `` that the anticonvulsant_activity [ of AAB and APB ] resided primarily in the R stereoisomers ''
J.A
3240
In this study Dr._Kohn also kept the R and R1_positions constant as benzyl and methyl respectively while testing the effect of different substituents at the R3_position

Finally in 1991 Dr._Kohn evaluated `` compound_3l '' a racemate ( `` Kohn 1991 '' )
Compound 3l contained a methoxyamino group at R3 and exhibited superior anticonvulsant properties
Notably like lacosamide compound_3l contained a nonaromatic_group at R3
Compound 3l had instability problems however which were of concern for pharmaceutical formulations

In addition to Dr._Kohn 's own publications his research was disclosed in a 1987 thesis completed by his graduate student Philippe LeGall ( `` LeGall '' )
LeGall focused on 15 new FAAs and their potential anticonvulsant activities
Relevant here LeGall disclosed compound_107e
Compound 107e is the racemate of the lacosamide compound claimed in the '551_patent meaning that instead of the isolated R-enantiomer ( lacosamide ) claimed in the '551_patent compound_107e is a mixture of both the R and S_enantiomers
In the study compound_107e belonged to a class of compounds called `` polar analogues '' of a parent compound 68a
Similar to lacosamide LeGall replaced the R3_position in compound_107e with a nonaromatic methoxymethyl_group

LeGall discloses and provides anticonvulsant efficacy data for all 15 compounds except for compound_107e
The class of compounds to which compound_107e belonged all contained nonaromatic_groups and as a class these compounds showed little to no potency resulting in ED50_values ranging from above 100 mg/kg to above 300 mg/kg.1 By comparison LeGall reported that other proven anticonvulsants had ED50_values of 14.0 18.7 20.1 and 61.0 mg/kg and some other FAAs had ED50_values of 51.BIG_TOKEN__0_and_62__BIG_TOKEN0 mg/kg
Despite not disclosing any pharmacological_data for compound_107e LeGall speculated that because of its structural similarities to compound 86b in the study which had an EDBIG_TOKEN__50_of_62__BIG_TOKEN compound_107e `` may have good anticonvulsant_activity ''
J.A
5001 5050
LeGall concluded that the most active compounds studied had heteroaromatic_groups in the R3_position whereas compound_107e had a nonaromatic_group

Dr._Kohn 's research led to the filing of U.S._Patent_No._5378 729_in_1991 which is prior_art to the '551_patent
The '729_patent issued to Dr._Kohn in 1995 and discloses a genus of FAAs
Its specification explains that the claimed compounds exhibit `` central nervous system ( CNS ) activity which are useful in the treatment of epilepsy and other CNS disorders ''
'729_patent col. 1_ll._30 -33
The compounds of the '729_patent share the following general formula : *1320

?
Id.at_col. 1_ll._37 -43
The '729_patent lists many different compounds and groups that can be placed at each R position which the district_court found could form millions of possible compounds
Important to the issues here the '729_patent teaches that `` [ t ] he preferred values of R is aryl lower alkyl especially benzyl '' and `` [ t ] he most preferred R1 group is methyl ''
Id.at_col. 5_ll._17 -19
For the R3_position the '729_patent lists a number of preferred heterocyclics and alkyl and lower alkoxy groups but does not list methoxymethyl
Id.at_col. 6_ll._13 -31

The '729_patent also discloses Table 1 containing pharmacological_data for 54 FAAs
None of the compounds listed in Table 1 are lacosamide compound_107e disclosed in LeGall or any FAA compound with a methoxymethyl_group at R3
All of the compounds listed in Table 1 of the '729_patent have a methyl at RBIG_TOKEN__1_and_49__BIG_TOKEN of them have an unsubstituted_benzyl at R all with varying potency ranging from 3.3 mg/kg to over 300 mg/kg
Of the top ten compounds with the most potency ( i.e. lowest ED50 ) eight had heteroaromatic_groups at R3 and two had nitrogen-based groups
Unlike lacosamide none of the most potent compounds in Table 1 had a nonaromatic_group at R3
The four compounds with nonaromatic_groups at R3 showed moderate to weak potency

U.S._Patent_No._5654,301 is a continuation-in-part of the '729_patent and was filed in 1993
The '301_patent is not prior_art to the '551_patent
Appellants rely on the '301_patent only for their argument that the '551_patent is invalid for obviousness-type_double_patenting
Like its parent '729_patent the '301_patent claims compounds of a general structure and recites several different groups that can be placed at the R and R1_positions
The relevant claims at issue for purposes of double patenting are claims 39-47 of the '301_patent which are reproduced below : 39
A compound of the formula
?
or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof wherein
R is aryl aryl lower alkyl heterocyclic heterocyclic lower alkyl cycloalkyl or lower cycloalkyl lower alkyl wherein R is unsubstituted or is substituted with at least one electron withdrawing group or an electron donating group ; *1321 R1 is hydrogen or lower alkyl and R1 is unsubstituted or substituted with at least one electron withdrawing group or at least one electron donating group ; A and Q are both O ; one of R2 and R3 is hydrogen and the other is lower alkyl which is substituted with an electron donating group or a electron withdrawing group and n is 1-4
40
The compound according to claim 39 wherein one of R2 and R3 is hydrogen and the other is lower alkyl substituted with an electron donating group
41
The compound according to claim 40 wherein one of R2 and R3 is alkyl substituted with an electron donating group wherein alkyl is methyl ethyl propyl isopropyl butyl isobutyl t-butyl amyl or hexyl
42
The compound according to claim 41 wherein one of R2 and R3 is methyl substituted with an electron donating group
43
The compound according to claim 42 wherein the electron donating group is lower alkoxy
44
The compound according to claim 43 wherein lower alkoxy is methoxy
45
The compound according to any one of claims 39-44 wherein n is 1
46
An anti-convulsant composition comprising an anti-convulsant effective amount of a compound from any one of claim 37-42 and a pharmaceutical carrier therefor
47
A method of treating CNS disorders in an animal comprising administering to said animal an anti-convulsant effective amount of a compound of any one of claims 39-44
'301_patent col. 93_l._3 - col. 94_l._21

Independent claim 39 permits a large_number of groups at R R1 and R3 where each group can comprise a large_number of substituents and can be either unsubstituted or substituted
Hence the district_court found that claim 39 could be thousands if not millions of possible group combinations
Although the specification does list some of the most preferred groups the list also contains generic categories of substituents creating a large scope of possible groups
Although lacosamide is not specifically disclosed in the '301_patent it is undisputed that lacosamide falls within the broad genus of claim 39 of the '301_patent

Claim 45 which depends from claim 44 recites that R3 is a methoxymethyl_group which is the substituent at R3 in lacosamide and claimed in the '551_patent
Claim 45 does not recite the molecules at R and R1 however
As stated above claim 45 depends from claim 39 which recites a genus of groups that can be located at R and R1
