Opinion
RICH Circuit_Judge
This appeal is from the District Court for the Western_District of Washington
This suit for patent infringement was tried to a jury and by agreement of the parties presided over by a magistrate
Defendants Peter K. Musland Norsol Inc. and Wink Corporation appeal from the judgment entered on the jury 's verdict holding them liable for infringing Roger Sjolund 's ( Sjolund ) U.S. Patent No._4221,071 ( '071 ) on an improved_crab_trap awarding damages and enjoining defendants from further_acts of infringement
We reverse the judgment because we conclude that the magistrate erred in denying defendants ' motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict ( JNOV ) that the claims in suit are invalid for obviousness under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103

BACKGROUND
The Claimed Invention
The '071_patent defines three improvements on a conventional_king_crab_trap
The first improvement is intended to prevent crabs from escaping a trap once having entered it
Crab fisherman found that as a trap became crowded with crabs piled one on top of the other many crabs were able to leave the trap by crawling up a side face of the entrance_tunnel to the upper_surface of the tunnel and from there out through the entrance_frame and out the tunnel to the ocean floor
Sjolund 's solution to this problem was to add triangular baffles in the upper corners of the trap extending from the upper_surfaces of the entrance_tunnels to the top face of the trap to prevent crabs from crawling from the side faces of an entrance_tunnel onto its upper_surface
Claim 1 defines this improvement and is in Jepson form
The lengthy preamble describes a conventional_crab_trap and then the body of the claim defines the improvement which comprises
a pair of baffles mounted between opposite edges of said entrance_frame and spaced apart locations on said lateral_face to block said escape route thereby preventing crabs from escaping from said trap
It is clear from the preamble that the `` lateral_face '' is one of the faces which defines the mouth of an entrance_tunnel
We note that the claim is drafted in terms of a trap having an `` entrance_frame '' and `` a pair of baffles ''
It reads equally well on traps in actual use which typically have two entrance_frames and two pairs of baffles
The parties variously refer to the baffles as `` anti-escape baffles '' and `` tanner fences ''

Crab traps are often used to trap crab species of different sizes and the second improvement of the '071_patent is designed to facilitate the conversion of the trap from one species to another
The patent specification states that king and tanner_crabs are the most heavily fished species in Alaskan waters and that of the two the tanner_crab is substantially the smaller
Thus the tanner_crab may escape easily through the large mesh in the escapement_panel of the standard trap
To convert the trap to tanner_crab fishing panels of a smaller mesh size are secured over the escapement_panel
Thus claim 16 reads ( paragraphing ours ) : 16
In a crab_trap of the type having an outline of a right rectangular prism formed by four lateral_faces of netting extending between a pair of bases covered by netting to form an enclosure the mesh of the netting covering said bases and all but one [ of ] said lateral_faces being of a first_size and the mesh of the netting covering the remaining lateral *1575 face being of a second substantially larger size the improvement comprising a plurality of net_panels having a mesh of said first_size said panels being releasably secured to each other and to said enclosure across said remaining lateral_face so that said trap may be easily converted from a trap for one species of crab to a trap for a different species of crab
Appropriately enough the parties refer to these net_panels as `` tanner_panels ''

The third improvement of the '071_patent permits the entrance_frame_opening of the trap to be partially closed when the trap is used for tanner_crab fishing
This is accomplished through the use of a long rectangular board or panel placed parallel to the entrance_frame_opening and pivotable about one of its long edges so that in at least one position the board partially blocks the entrance_opening
This feature is found for example in dependent_claim 13 ( paragraphing ours ) : 13
The crab_trap of claim 1 further including means for varying the width of the entrance_opening formed by said entrance_frame comprising
a generally elongated panel having one of its longitudinal edges pivotally secured to said trap about an elongated edge of said entrance_frame such that said panel may be pivoted toward said entrance_frame to a partially closed position or away from said entrance_frame to a full open position
The parties variously refer to the `` elongated panel '' of claim 13 as a `` tanner_board '' or a `` lattice board ''

Sjolund asserted infringement of claims 7-10 13 and 16-19
As set forth immediately above the subject_matter of dependent_claim 13 is the combination of a conventional_crab_trap with anti-escape baffles and a tanner_board
Claims 7-10 omit the tanner_board but add the element of a plurality of tanner_panels in various stages of refinement
Thus the subject_matter of these claims is the combination of a crab_trap with anti-escape baffles and a plurality of tanner_panels
Claim 16 is an independent_claim to a conventional trap in combination with a plurality of tanner_panels
Claims 17-19 depend from claim 16 and add the same refinements to the tanner panel arrangement as are found in claims 8-10
