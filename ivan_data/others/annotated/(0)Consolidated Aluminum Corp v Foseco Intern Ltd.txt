BACKGROUND
We presume familiarity with the `` Memorandum_Opinion '' of the district_court 716_F.Supp._316 11_USPQ2d_1817_(N.D.Ill.1989) and the `` Report and Recommendation '' of the special_master,1 10_USPQ2d_1143_(N.D.Ill.1988)
Hence we set forth only those facts that underlie issues dispositive of this appeal

On May_4,_1982 Consolidated sued four parties ( Foseco Alumax Trialco and FIL ) charging violations of its rights under six United States patents ( Nos._3893,917 ( '917 ) 3,962,081 ( '081 ) 4,024,056 ( '056 ) 4,081,371 ( '371 ) 4,024,212 ( '212 ) and 4,075,303 ( '303 ) ) relating to the manufacture and use of ceramic_foam_filters for molten_metal particularly aluminum
All of the charged violations relate to Foseco 's SIVEX ceramic filter
Foseco is charged with joint contributory or induced_infringement of the '917_patent in making and selling the SIVEX ; Alumax and Trialco are charged with direct_infringement of the '917_patent in using the SIVEX ; FIL is charged with inducing infringement of the '917 by encouraging Foseco to commercialize and teaching Foseco how to make the SIVEX ; Foseco is charged with direct and contributory_infringement of the '081_patent in making and selling the SIVEX ; Alumax and Trialco are charged with direct_infringement of the '081_patent in using the SIVEX ; FIL is charged with contributory or induced_infringement of the '081 in encouraging Foseco to commercialize and teaching Foseco how to make the SIVEX ; Foseco is charged with contributory_infringement of the '056 and '371_patent s in using the SIVEX ; Alumax and Trialco are charged with direct_infringement of the '056 and '371_patent s in using the SIVEX ; FIL is charged with contributory or induced_infringement of the '212 and '303_patent s in encouraging Foseco to commercialize and helping and teaching Foseco to make the SIVEX.2 Defendants filed counterclaims alleging antitrust_violations

On October 31 1988 after a six-week trial involving more than 2000 exhibits and testimony from 27 witnesses in court and 70 witnesses by deposition the special_master issued a 94 page `` report and recommendation '' holding : ( 1 ) claims 1-BIG_TOKEN__2_and_4__BIG_TOKEN -9 of the '917_patent claims 2 7 8 10 and 14 of the '081_patent the '056_patent the '371_patent claims 15 20 and 24 of the '212_patent and claims 3 7 15 and 20 of the '303_patent invalid in view of the prior_art 35 U.S.C.¡±¡± 102 103 ; ( 2 ) the '917_patent invalid for failure to disclose the best_mode 35 U.S.C.¡± 112 ; ( 3 ) the '917_patent unenforceable because Consolidated 's intentional withholding of the best_mode and disclosure of a fictitious inoperative mode constituted inequitable_conduct ; ( 4 ) claims 1 4 5 and 9 of the '081_patent claims 1 2 and 18 of the '212_patent and claim 1 of the '303_patent not invalid and willfully infringed by Foseco and FIL ; ( 5 ) claims 1 4 5 and 9 of the '081_patent infringed by Trialco and Alumax ; ( 6 ) that *807 Consolidated had not committed antitrust_violations ; ( 7 ) that further_infringement should be permanently enjoined ; ( 8 ) that Consolidated 's request to change inventorship of the '917 and '081_patent s be denied see 35 U.S.C.¡± 256 ; and ( 9 ) that `` Yarwood and Preuss were improperly added as named inventors of the '363_patent
`` 3

The parties submitted objections to the special_master 's report and recommendation pursuant to Rule 53 ( e ) ( 2 ) Fed.R.Civ.P
On June_15,_1989 the district_court issued a 46 page `` Memorandum_Opinion '' affirming the determinations that ( 1 ) the '917 '371 and '056_patent s were invalid ; ( 2 ) the '917_patent was invalid for failure to disclose the best_mode ; and ( 3 ) the '917_patent was unenforceable because of Consolidated 's inequitable_conduct in concealing the best and disclosing a fictitious mode in the '917_patent
The court also : ( 4 ) held the '917_patent unenforceable because Consolidated 's intentional failure to disclose prior_art constituted inequitable_conduct ; ( 5 ) held the '081 '212 and '303_patent s unenforceable because of Consolidated 's `` broad pattern of inequitable_conduct '' ; ( 6 ) rejected the determinations that the '081 '212 and '303_patent s were not invalid and were infringed ; ( 7 ) affirmed the dismissal of the antitrust counterclaims ; and ( 8 ) vacated the injunction against further_infringement
The district_court adopted all findings of the special_master not specifically rejected

Judgment was entered on June_21,_1989
On July_6,_1989 the district_court denied Foseco 's motion for attorney_fees
