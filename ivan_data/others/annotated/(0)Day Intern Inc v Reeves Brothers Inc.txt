Because we conclude that the magistrate_judge 's construction of the disputed claim language is correct we affirm

I
Day_International Inc. ( `` Day '' ) is the holder of U.S. Patent No._4770,928 ( `` the ¡¬928_patent `` ) entitled `` Method of Curing a Compressible Printing Blanket and a Compressible Printing Blanket Produced Thereby '' which issued on September 13 1988
The ¡¬928_patent relates to an improved_method of manufacturing compressible_printing_blankets used for printing newspapers magazines and other_products made using offset lithographic_printing_methods

Printing blankets are used in the printing industry to transfer ink from a printing plate to paper
Accurate image reproduction requires that a printing_blanket be capable of withstanding a certain amount of compression during the mechanical printing process yet be sufficiently resilient to return to its original thickness
To achieve this compressible quality printing_blankets are constructed as multi-layered assemblies of which at least one layer is made of an elastomeric_material into which tiny_voids have been introduced
The tiny_voids enable the elastomeric_material to absorb compressive forces such as those commonly experienced in the printing process
The following figure taken from the ¡¬928_patent reveals a cross-sectional cutout of a multi-layered printing_blanket where the compressible_layer ( 24 ) is shown containing voids ( 28 ) :

?
A variety of methods have been used in the prior art to create the voids in the compressible_layer of a printing_blanket
One way of introducing these voids was to mix hollow_microcapsules into the elastomeric_material prior to the curing or vulcanization of the printing_blanket
However because the curing process must be done at temperatures high enough to transform the soft tacky elastomeric_material into a strong temperature-stable substance the hollow_microcapsules would melt before the elastomeric_material fully vulcanized causing agglomeration of voids
The resulting product was a compressible_layer with voids which lacked uniform_size and distribution a characteristic which adversely affected *1346 printing quality and the durability of the printing_blanket itself

The ¡¬928_patent is directed to an improved_method1 in which the compressible_layer is cured in a way that avoids the agglomeration_problem experienced in prior_art_processes
Specifically as described in the ¡¬928_patent after the microcapsules have been evenly mixed into the elastomeric_material and laid down to form a compressible_layer the layer is initially cured at temperatures that are below the melting_point of the microcapsules but high enough to sufficiently set the structure of the polymeric matrix about them ( i.e. 110-170 degrees_F )
¡¬928_patent col._5,_ll._55-63
This initial step is identified as a `` low temperature cure '' 2 in both the patent and its prosecution_history
¡¬928_patent col._6,_l._21
It serves to fix the position of the microcapsules in the compressible_layer thereby fixing the positions of the resultant voids as well
¡¬928_patent col._6,_ll._5-8 20-25 59-63

Other layers are subsequently added to the initial vulcanized compressible_layer to form a complete printing_blanket and then the entire blanket assembly is cured again this time at curing temperatures high enough to melt the microcapsules ( i.e. 270-320 degrees_F ) thus forming voids in the compressible_layer
¡¬928_patent col._6,_ll._33-45
Since the positions of the microcapsules have already been fixed by the initial low temperature cure the voids do not agglomerate or interconnect as they did in prior_art_processes
The result according to the ¡¬928_patent is a compressible printing_blanket with voids of substantially uniform_size and substantially even distribution throughout the compressible_layer
¡¬928_patent col._3,_ll._23-30

The asserted independent method claims in the ¡¬928_patent are claims 1_and_21
They state as follows : 1
A method of making a laminated printing_blanket_construction comprising the steps of : providing at least one fabric substrate layer forming an intermediate_compressible_layer of an elastomeric_material thereon said intermediate_compressible_layer having a substantially uniform_thickness and having microcapsules incorporated therein said microcapsules being substantially uniformly distributed throughout said intermediate_compressible_layer maintaining said intermediate_compressible_layer at a temperature below the melting_point of said microcapsules for a time sufficient to cause said elastomeric_material to vulcanize to a degree sufficient to substantially fix the positions of said microcapsules within said intermediate_compressible_layer providing a surface layer over said intermediate_compressible_layer to form said printing_blanket_construction and
vulcanizing said construction to cure said layers and provide said intermediate layer with substantially uniformly distributed voids of substantially uniform_size
'928_patent col._7,_l._61-- col._8,_l._15
21
A method of making a compressible_layer for use in a laminated printing *1347 blanket_construction comprising the steps of : forming said compressible_layer of an elastomeric_material and mixing microcapsules with said elastomeric_material so that said microcapsules are substantially uniformly distributed therein maintaining said compressible_layer at a temperature below the melting_point of said microcapsules for a time sufficient to cause said elastomeric_material to vulcanize to a degree sufficient to substantially fix the positions of said microcapsules within said compressible_layer thereby providing a compressible_layer having a substantially uniform_thickness with said microcapsules being substantially uniformly distributed throughout said compressible_layer
'928_patent col._10,_ll._6-22

The main difference between the two asserted claims is that claim 1 recites the full two-step process for producing an entire printing_blanket whereas claim 21 focuses on the compressible_layer itself
For purposes of this appeal however the differences between the two claims are irrelevant because the disputed claim terms are identical in both claims

Reeves_Brothers Inc. ( `` Reeves '' ) manufactures compressible_printing_blankets using a method in which the compressible_layer is initially cured at conventional vulcanization temperatures
To avoid the agglomeration_problem of the prior_art_processes Reeves uses high melting_point microspheres,3 or microcapsules which melt only at temperatures well above conventional vulcanizing temperatures
After the compressible_layer is vulcanized at approximately 280 degrees_F one or more layers are added to the compressible_layer and then the final blanket assembly is cured at approximately 285 degrees_F. Day_Int ' l slip op.at 10-11
It is undisputed that Reeves has never cured the compressible_layer in its products at a temperature below 270 degrees_F

On June_8,_1999 Day filed an infringement action against Reeves in the United_States_District_Court for the District of South_Carolina alleging that Reeves ' manufacturing process infringed claims 1_and_21 of the ¡¬928_patent
Specifically Day argued that Reeves ' use of high melting_point microspheres to avoid the agglomeration of voids satisfied the limitation in the ¡¬928_patent that the compressible_layer be cured `` at a temperature below the melting_point of [ the ] microcapsules ''
Reeves countered by arguing that the scope of the invention should be limited to processes which involve an initial curing step at `` low temperatures '' namely at 110-170 degrees_F and filed a motion for summary_judgment of noninfringement on December 30 1999
Essentially agreeing with the position taken by Reeves the magistrate_judge granted summary_judgment of noninfringement in favor of Reeves
