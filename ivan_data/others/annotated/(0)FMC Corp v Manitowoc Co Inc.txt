Opinion
MARKEY Chief_Judge
Appeal from a judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of Illinois Eastern_Division ( Hart J
) upholding the validity of U.S. Patent No._3485,383 ( '383 ) owned by The Manitowoc Company Inc. ( Manitowoc ) finding the '383_patent not infringed by FMC Corporation ( FMC ) and resolving the issues raised by FMC 's claims of inequitable_conduct attorney fees antitrust violation and unfair_competition in favor of Manitowoc
We affirm

Background
On September 5 1980 FMC sued for a judgment declaring that its heavy lift cranes did not infringe the '383_patent that the patent was invalid and unenforceable and that Manitowoc 's maintenance and threatened enforcement of the patent constituted unfair_competition because FMC was forced to `` design around '' the patent procured through inequitable_conduct
Manitowoc then sued FMC for infringement and FMC counterclaimed alleging violation of the antitrust_laws
The two cases were not formally consolidated but were treated and tried together

Proceedings encompassed over six years in the district court and involved participation for varying periods of two magistrates and four district judges
The case including pretrial skirmishes generated over 1000 entries on 80 docket pages
The record exceeded 17,000 pages

On January 30 1987 after conducting six weeks of trial hearing numerous witnesses and rendering many rulings Judge Hart entered a comprehensive 60- *1413 page set of clearly stated findings and conclusions in which he incorporated his evaluations of the evidence and his reasoning and to which he appended drawings admitted as exhibits
