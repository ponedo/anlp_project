United States Court of Appeals Federal Circuit
AGFA CORPORATION Plaintiff-Appellant v. CREO PRODUCTS INC. Creo Inc. Creoscitex America Corporation Creossu Inc. Scitex Corporation Ltd. Scitex Development Corp. and Scitex America Corp. Defendants-Appellees
No._05-1079
| June_26,_2006
| Rehearing En Banc Denied Sept._25,_2006
Synopsis
Background : Patentee brought action against competitor alleging infringement of its patents for an automated computer-to-plate system for making multiple printing plates
The United_States_District_Court for the District of Massachusetts George A. O'Toole Jr. J. 2004_WL_2387288 declared all the asserted_patents unenforceable for inequitable_conduct and patentee appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Rader Circuit_Judge held that :

trial_court 's decision to hold a bench_trial on issue of patentee 's alleged inequitable_conduct did not preclude the court 's later grant of a jury_trial on issue of patent 's validity ;

term `` stack '' in the patents encompassed a number of plates arranged together in an orderly fashion regardless of the orientation of the collection as a whole ;

undisclosed prior art during prosecution of patents was material ; and

evidence was sufficient to establish that patentee intended to deceive patent examiner

Affirmed

Newman Circuit_Judge filed dissenting opinion

*1369 RADER Circuit_Judge
After a bench_trial the United_States_District_Court for the District of Massachusetts declared all of Agfa Corporation 's asserted_patents unenforceable for inequitable_conduct
Agfa_Corp. v. Creo Prods. Inc. Civil_Action_No._00-10836-_GAO ( D.Mass
Oct._5,_2004 ) ( Judgment ) ( judgment incorporating the trial_court 's earlier Findings of Fact Conclusions of Law and Order for Judgment dated Aug._24,_2004 ( Decision ) )
Agfa challenges that result and also appeals the trial_court 's order granting the defendants ' 1 request that inequitable_conduct be tried to the court prior to a jury_trial on the other issues in the case
Agfa_Corp. v. Creo Prods. Inc. Civil_Action_No._00-10836-_GAO ( D.Mass
July_16,_2003 ) ( Bench Trial Order )
Finally Agfa appeals the trial_court 's award of attorney fees under 35 U.S.C.¡± 285
Judgment ( incorporating the trial_court 's Award of Attorneys ' Fees and Costs dated Oct._5,_2004 ( Attorney Fees Decision ) )
Because the trial_court did not err in any of those decisions and because this court agrees with the trial_court 's claim construction of the one disputed claim term this court affirms

I
Large scale printing typically uses presses with plates made of materials such as aluminum or polyester
Conventionally those plates are formed with a two-step method
The first step places a desired image on polyester film
The next step transfers that image to the printing plate
A light-sensitive chemical emulsion on the plate often facilitates that transfer
Mounted on the printing press the plate then reproduces images in a conventional manner

Unlike that conventional technique `` computer-to-plate '' ( CTP ) systems take a desired image which can include both written and graphic content and transfer that image directly from a computer onto the plate
These plates made with a CTP_system then substitute for conventionally formed plates
CTP_systems offer clear advantages over conventional methods of forming printing plates

Agfa owns U.S. Patent Nos._5655,452 ( the '452_patent ) ; 5,738,014 ( the '014_patent ) ; 5,788,455 ( the '455_patent ) ; 5,791,250 ( the '250_patent ) ; 5,992,324 ( the '324_patent ) ; and 6,000,337 ( the '337_patent )
Those patents claim various features of Agfa 's CTP_system i.e. its `` Galileo '' system
As taught in the asserted_patents Agfa 's Galileo system further improves CTP automation by facilitating the creation of multiple plates of different sizes
Agfa 's patents all feature the same specification and drawings
Figure 1 of the '452_patent reproduced below is representative of Agfa 's patented system

*1370. ?
As shown in that figure CTP_system 10 includes a computer 12 and image processor 14 linked to a platesetter 16
The platesetter includes a plate_handler 18 having a number of cassettes 24 which include stacks of plates 26
During operation the handler 18 can move the cassettes up or down such that a `` picker '' 28 can access any particular individual plate
Each cassette can include up to 100 plates each separated from the adjoining plates by a protective `` slip sheet '' which is automatically removed by a slip sheet removal mechanism 25
While each cassette contains plates of the same size plate_size can differ from cassette to cassette
Thus during operation the `` picker '' can change plate_size by selecting a different cassette

Because the plates are light sensitive an operator loads the cassettes in a darkroom
After receiving the cassettes the system operates without human intervention
The system selects a plate and transfers it to the imaging_engine 22
The imaging_engine prints an image directly onto the plate
The claim_construction_dispute in this case however concerns the plate_handler 18
More specifically as discussed below the claim_construction_dispute concerns the meaning of the term `` stack '' that appears in every asserted claim

Agfa and Creo compete in the CTP market
Agfa sued Creo alleging that Creo 's CTP_system infringed all of Agfa 's Galileo_patents
As a defense as well as a counterclaim Creo asserted that all of Agfa 's Galileo_patents are unenforceable due to Agfa 's inequitable_conduct before the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( PTO )
According to Creo Agfa wrongfully declined to disclose material prior art to the PTO during prosecution of Agfa 's asserted *1371 patents
Specifically Creo contended that Agfa did not disclose at least three prior art systems the Creo Platesetter 3244 the Barco LithoSetter and the Gerber Cressent/42
Creo further asserted that this prior art was more relevant to Agfa 's applications than the single reference discussed in the specification common to all of Agfa 's applications a U.S. Patent on computer-to-film printing
Decision slip op.at 24-25

The district_court severed the inequitable_conduct issue from the rest of the case and over Agfa 's objection conducted a bench_trial on that issue
At the conclusion of that trial the district_court declared all of Agfa 's patents unenforceable
The district_court further concluded that Agfa 's inequitable_conduct rendered the case exceptional and awarded attorneys ' fees under 35 U.S.C.¡± 285
