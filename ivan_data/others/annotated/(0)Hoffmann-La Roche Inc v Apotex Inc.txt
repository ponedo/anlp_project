BRYSON Circuit_Judge
Plaintiff Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. ( `` Roche '' ) appeals from the decision of the United_States_District_Court for the District of New_Jersey granting the defendant generic drug companies summary judgment of invalidity as to claims 1-8 of U.S._Patent_No._7718,634 ( `` the ¡¬634_patent `` ) and claims 1-10 of U.S._Patent_No._7410,957 ( `` the ¡¬957_patent `` )
We affirm

I
The patents at issue in this appeal are directed to methods of treating osteoporosis through the once monthly_administration of ibandronate one of a class of compounds known as bisphosphonates
Ibandronate a salt of ibandronic_acid is commercially available as Roche 's once monthly BonivaTHE_R which was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration ( `` FDA '' ) in 2005 for the treatment of osteoporosis
Once monthly Boniva *1328 THE_R provides a 150 milligram ( `` mg '' ) dose of ibandronate

Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by abnormal bone resorption
Resorption the biological process by which bone is broken down causes decreased bone strength and an increased risk of fractures
Bisphosphonates are `` potent inhibitors of bone resorption ''
¡¬957_patent col._1,_ll._39-40
They inhibit abnormal bone destruction and enable the gradual restoration of lost bone mineral density ( `` BMD '' )

Bisphosphonates are generally known to have a low bioavailability when administered orally i.e. only a small fraction of a given dose is absorbed into the blood
Additionally oral administration of bisphosphonates can result in adverse esophageal and gastrointestinal side effects
As a result of the side effects and to improve the bioavailability of the drug patients taking bisphosphonates must adhere to a dosing regimen that requires a bisphosphonate tablet to be taken in a fasting state at least 30 minutes before eating or drinking
In the past the inconvenience of that regimen created problems of patient compliance
Researchers in the field believed that less-frequent dosing would result in patients continuing the treatment for the long term which is required for bisphosphonate treatments to be successful

Roche owns the ¡¬634_patent and the ¡¬957_patent which is the parent of the ¡¬634_patent
Claims 1-8 of the ¡¬634_patent and claims 1-10 of the ¡¬ 957 patent are at issue in this case and describe a method of treating osteoporosis consisting of orally administering about 150 mg of ibandronic_acid once monthly on a single_day
Claim 1 of the ¡¬634_patent is representative of the claims on appeal : 1
A method for treating or inhibiting postmenopausal_osteoporosis in a postmenopausal_woman in need of treatment or inhibition of postmenopausal_osteoporosis by administration of a pharmaceutically acceptable_salt of ibandronic_acid comprising : ( a ) commencing the administration of the pharmaceutically acceptable_salt of ibandronic_acid by orally administering to the postmenopausal_woman on a single_day a first dose in the form of a tablet wherein the tablet comprises an amount of the pharmaceutically acceptable_salt of ibandronic_acid that is equivalent to about 150 mg of ibandronic_acid ; and
( b ) continuing the administration by orally administering once monthly on a single_day a tablet comprising an amount of the pharmaceutically acceptable_salt of ibandronic_acid that is equivalent to about 150 mg of ibandronic_acid
