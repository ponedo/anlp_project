Opinion
*1366 DYK Circuit_Judge
Gemalto S.A. ( `` Gemalto '' ) is the owner of U.S. Patent Nos._6308,317 ( `` the ¡¬317_patent `` ) 7,117,485 ( `` the ¡¬485_patent `` ) and 7,818,727 ( `` the ¡¬ 727 patent '' )
Gemalto sued HTC Corporation HTC_America Inc. Exedea Inc. Google Inc. Motorola_Mobility LLC Samsung_Electronics_Co. Ltd. and Samsung_Telecommunications_America LLC ( collectively `` defendants '' ) in the Eastern_District of Texas alleging infringement of various claims of the three patents
The district_court construed the asserted claims and granted summary_judgment of non-infringement concluding that the accused products did not infringe literally or under the doctrine of equivalents
On appeal Gemalto challenges the district_court 's claim construction and its grant of summary_judgment of non-infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
We affirm

BACKGROUND
The ¡¬317_patent the ¡¬485_patent and the ¡¬727_patent derive priority from the same provisional patent application,1 and share the same named inventors specification and title : `` Using a High Level Programming Language with a Microcontroller
`` 2 The patented technology is designed to allow resource-constrained devices including microcontrollers to run software applications ( or programs ) written in high_level_programming_languages such as Java

Before Gemalto 's invention microprocessor-based personal computers could run Java_applications
At the time of Gemalto 's invention these computers used processors that required substantial amounts of memory which was located on chips separate from the chip containing the processor ( referred to as off-chip_memory )
However microcontroller-based devices such as integrated circuit_cards ( or smart_cards ) had substantially less memory using memory located on the same_chip as the processor
These devices did not require external memory to function but were constrained by the amount of space on the chip ( or integrated circuit ) used for memory
At the time of Gemalto 's invention there were no Java implementations for microcontroller-based smart_cards or integrated circuit_cards
Due to the disparity between the constraints of the devices and the demands of the applications `` [ f ] itting Java technology inside smart_cards was like playing golf in a telephone booth ''
Joint Appendix ( `` J.A '' )
643 ( quoting Sun Microsystems CEO Scott McNealy ) ( internal quotation marks omitted )

According to Gemalto its invention enabled resource-constrained devices to run applications written in high_level_programming_languages ( such as Java ) by minimizing the computing resources that applications consumed during storage and execution
The asserted claims are directed to applications that are converted from a high_level_programming_language into another format that is suitable for resource-constrained computing devices
The application in converted form is stored in the memory of the chip containing the embedded processor that executes the application
However the processor can not run the converted_application directly and requires an interpreter ( or virtual machine ) to translate the converted_application into instructions that the processor can execute
The interpreter is also stored in on-chip_memory
This is important because to run a Java application both the application and the interpreter must fit within the constraints of the platform for the purposes of storage and execution

*1367 In October 2010 Gemalto sued the defendants for infringement alleging that the defendants ' smartphones infringe when they run the Android operating system and Java_applications ( converted using the Android software development kit )
The defendants contended that the accused smartphones do not infringe because they are not resource-constrained devices but rather rely on off-chip_memory to run Java_applications similar to prior art personal computers

Before summary_judgment Gemalto narrowed the number of asserted claims to the 6 claims asserted on appeal : claims 1 4 and 5 of the ¡¬317_patent ; claims 38_and_39 of the ¡¬485_patent ; and claim 3 of the ¡¬727_patent3 These claims recite either an `` integrated circuit_card '' or a `` programmable_device '' that includes a processor and a `` memory '' storing a converted_application and an interpreter
Claim 1 of the ¡¬317_patent which is representative of the `` integrated circuit_card '' claims reads :

1
An integrated circuit_card for use with a terminal comprising : a communicator configured to communicate with the terminal ; a memory storing : an application derived from a program written in a high_level_programming_language_format wherein the application is derived from a program written in a high_level_programming_language_format by first compiling the program into a compiled form and then converting the compiled form into a converted form the converting step including at least one step selected from a group consisting of
recording all jumps and their destinations in the original byte codes ; converting specific byte codes into equivalent generic byte codes or vice-versa ; modifying byte code operands from references using identifying strings to references using unique identifiers ; and
renumbering byte codes in a compiled format to equivalent byte codes in a format suitable for interpretation ; and
an interpreter operable to interpret such an application derived from a program written in a high_level_programming_language_format ; and
a processor coupled to the memory the processor configured to use the interpreter to interpret the application for execution and to use the communicator to communicate with the terminal
¡¬317_patent col. 19_ll._38 -67
Claim 3 of the ¡¬727_patent the only asserted claim directed to a `` programmable_device '' reads : 3
A programmable_device comprising : a memory and
a processor ; the memory comprising : an interpreter ; and.at least one application loaded in the memory to be interpreted by the interpreter wherein the at least one application is generated by a programming environment comprising : a ) a compiler for compiling application source programs written in high level language source code form into a compiled form and
b ) a converter for post processing the compiled form into a minimized form suitable for interpretation within the *1368 set of resource_constraints by the interpreter
¡¬727_patent_col. 19_ll._29 -43 ( emphases added )
Both the integrated circuit_card and programmable_device claims require the recited `` memory '' to store a converted_application and an interpreter
The asserted programmable_device claim expressly requires the application to be converted `` into a minimized form suitable for interpretation within the set of resource_constraints by the interpreter ''
¡¬727_patent_col. 19_ll._41 -43
The district_court construed the recited `` memory '' as `` all program_memory '' -i.e. `` sufficient memory to run the Java code [ or other high_level_programming_language ] in accordance with the patentee 's invention ''
J.A
26 ( footnote omitted )
In other words the court 's construction required all application memory to be stored on the same_chip as the processor
The court construed `` resource_constraints '' to mean `` insufficient memory to run the compiled application source program in an unconverted form ''
J.A
40-41
The district_court construed `` integrated circuit_card '' to mean `` a card containing a single_semiconductor_substrate [ i.e. a chip ] having a central_processing_unit and all program_memory ''
J.A
31
The court construed `` programmable_device '' as `` a single_semiconductor_substrate integrating electronic_circuit_components that includes a central_processing_unit and all program_memory making it suitable for use as an embedded system ''
J.A
33

After the court construed the claims the defendants moved for summary_judgment of non-infringement
Gemalto did not dispute that the `` accused devices do not contain 'all program_memory ' on a single_semiconductor_substrate because they require 'off chip ' memory to run the accused.. Android applications '' J.A
11 but argued that requiring off-chip_memory did not preclude infringement
The court concluded that the accused devices did not literally infringe because applications were stored in off-chip_memory-i.e. on a chip other than the chip containing the processor
The court also rejected Gemalto 's theory that the accused devices infringed under the doctrine of equivalents when they temporarily loaded program instructions into on-chip cache memory prior to execution
The court concluded that temporary storage in cache memory was not substantially the same as permanent memory storage
