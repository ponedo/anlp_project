* Synopsis
Patentee brought infringement action against competitor claiming infringement of its patent for an improved method of fabricating metal_oxide_semiconductor ( MOS ) field_effect_transistors in a large scale integrated circuit
The United_States_District_Court for the District of Delaware Roderick R. McKelvie J. 928_F.Supp._449 936_F.Supp._1186 granted summary_judgment in favor of competitor
Patentee appealed and competitor cross-appealed challenging ruling that competitor was not licensed under patent
The Court of Appeals Pauline Newman Circuit_Judge held that : ( 1 ) claim at issue was properly construed by district_court ; ( 2 ) patent was not literally infringed ; and ( 3 ) patent was not infringed under doctrine of equivalents

Affirmed and cross-appeal dismissed

Opinion
PAULINE NEWMAN Circuit_Judge
In this patent infringement case the United_States_District_Court for the District of Delaware following a two-day Markman hearing on the issue of `` claim construction '' granted summary_judgment in favor of Intel_Corporation holding that three of Intel 's manufacturing processes do not infringe United States Patent No._4486,943 ( the '943_patent ) owned by EMI Group North America.1 EMI appeals
Intel cross-appeals inter alia the ruling that Intel is not licensed under the '943_patent
We affirm the district_court 's judgment that the claims are not infringed and dismiss the cross-appeal

I
THE PATENTED INVENTION
The '943_patent entitled `` Zero Drain Overlap and Self Aligned Contact Method for MOS Devices '' issued December 11 1984 is directed to a method of fabricating metal_oxide_semiconductor ( MOS ) field_effect_transistors used in the integrated circuits of computer memory and microprocessor chips
Each MOS_transistor acts as a switch to turn an electric current on and off
A chip may contain as many as several million transistors

MOS_transistors are built on a wafer or `` substrate '' that forms the bottom of the transistor
A MOS_transistor typically consists of a gate_electrode that has been deposited on a thin dielectric ( insulating ) layer over the substrate with electrically conductive `` source '' and `` drain '' regions formed in the substrate on opposing sides of the gate_electrode
These conductive regions are separated by the `` channel '' a poorly conductive region under the gate_electrode
The basic MOS structure of the prior art is illustrated as follows :

*890. ?
-- -- - Upon application of voltage to the gate_electrode current flows from the source to the drain region emitting an electrical signal that contributes to the operation of the chip
When the gate voltage is discontinued the transistor reverts to static mode and ceases to emit signals

Various methods of manufacturing MOS_transistors have been described whereby a semiconductor is produced by forming a thin layer of dielectric material ( the oxide in the illustration ) on a silicon_substrate then depositing gate_electrode material such as polysilicon on the dielectric layer `` doping '' the polysilicon with activating ionic substances so that it will conduct electricity and vertically implanting or doping the source and drain regions of the silicon_substrate with ions so that they become conductive
The portion of the substrate under the gate_electrode is shielded from the vertical ion implantation whereby after implantation the edges of the source and drain regions are generally vertically aligned with the sides of the gate_electrode

After implantation the entire structure is heated to activate the ions in the implanted regions as is necessary to make the regions conductive
This step leads to an undesirable consequence because during this heating process the implanted ions tend to diffuse through the substrate
Diffusion under the gate_electrode causes buildup of an electric charge known as `` Miller_capacitance '' which reduces the transistor 's operating speed
The '943_patent is directed to a MOS_transistor fabrication method that reduces the occurrence of Miller_capacitance

In accordance with the '943 method dielectric oxide layers are thermally grown on the top and sides of the gate_electrode
This oxide serves as a mask during the ion implantation of the substrate thereby spacing the source and drain regions from the region under the gate as shown in Fig._1 of the '943_patent :
