Opinion
LOURIE Circuit_Judge
Spectrum_Pharmaceuticals Inc. ( `` Spectrum '' ) appeals from the decisions of the United_States_District_Court for the District of Nevada holding claims 1-2 of U.S._Patent 6,500,829 ( `` the ¡¬829_patent `` ) invalid as obvious and finding claims 5-9 of the ¡¬829_patent not infringed by the submission of an Abbreviated_New_Drug_Application ( `` ANDA '' ) by Sandoz_Inc. ( `` Sandoz '' )
Spectrum_Pharm. Inc. v. Sandoz_Inc. No._2 :12-cv-00111 2015_WL_794674 ( D.Nev
Feb. 25 2015 ) ( `` Trial_Order `` ) ; Spectrum_Pharm. Inc. v. Sandoz_Inc. No._2 :12-cv-00111 2014_WL_7368845 ( D.Nev
Dec. 29 2014 ) ( `` Summary_Judgment_Order `` )
Because the district_court did not err in concluding that claims 1-2 are invalid and additionally did not clearly err in finding claims 5-9 not infringed by Sandoz 's ANDA_product we affirm

BACKGROUND
Leucovorin is a compound used to ameliorate the toxic effects of methotrexate a chemotherapy treatment ( `` methotrexate_rescue '' ) ; to treat folate_deficiency ; and to enhance the efficacy of a 5-fluorouracil cancer treatment ( `` 5-FU combination_therapy '' )
Due to an asymmetric C6 carbon leucovorin may exist as a 50/50 mixture of two diastereoisomers the ( 6S ) and ( 6R ) isomers
The ( 6S ) diastereoisomer is also known as levoleucovorin or l-leucovorin and is the isomer with the desired biological activity

The ¡¬829_patent is directed to pharmaceutical_compositions of substantially pure_levoleucovorin
Claim 1 of the ¡¬829_patent reads as follows : *1330 1
A pharmaceutical_composition for therapeutic_use which consists essentially of a therapeutically effective amount sufficient for the treatment of human_beings for methotrexate_rescue or folate_deficiency of a pharmaceutically acceptable compound which is a ( 6S ) diastereoisomer selected from the group consisting of ( 6S ) leucovorin ( 5-formyl- ( 6S ) -tetrahydrofolic acid ) and pharmaceutically acceptable_salts and esters of ( 6S ) leucovorin ; wherein the compound consists of a mixture of ( 6S ) and ( 6R ) diastereoisomers and consists of at least 92 % by weight of the ( 6S ) diastereoisomer the balance of said compound consisting of the ( 6R ) diastereoisomer ; in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable_carrier
¡¬829_patent col. 9_ll._55 -67 ( emphases added )
The written description states that `` a typical_daily_dose '' of the ( 6S ) isomer for methotrexate_rescue would be `` up to 150 mg [ ] e.g
[ ] in the range from 25_to_150 mg '' and that `` a typical_daily_dose [ for treating folate_deficiency ] for an adult human is generally in the range from 2_to_25 mg. '' Id
col. 5_ll._15 -19 21-24
Claim 2 depends from claim 1 with the additional limitation that the composition `` consists of greater than 95 % by weight of the ( 6S ) diastereoisomer ''
Id
col. 10_ll._1 -3 ( emphasis added )

Claim 5 of the ¡¬829_patent reads as follows : 5
A pharmaceutical_composition for therapeutic_use for the treatment of human_beings comprising : a pharmaceutically acceptable composition which is a ( 6S ) diastereoisomer selected from the group consisting of ( 6S ) leucovorin ( 5-formyl- ( 6S ) -tetrahydrofolic acid ) and pharmaceutically acceptable_salts and esters of ( 6S ) leucovorin wherein the composition consists of a mixture of ( 6S ) and ( 6R ) diastereoisomers and consists of at least about 92 % by weight of the ( 6S ) diastereoisomer the balance of said composition consisting of the ( 6R ) diastereoisomer ; and a pharmaceutically acceptable_carrier ; and
said composition_being of a quantity at least sufficient to provide multiple_doses of said mixture of ( 6S ) and ( 6R ) diastereoisomers in an amount of 2000 mg per dose
Id
col. 10_ll._1 0-24 ( emphases added )
Claims 6-9 depend from claim 5 and contain additional limitations not at issue in this appeal

During prosecution of the application that became the ¡¬829_patent the examiner rejected the application 's claims as anticipated by or obvious over an article disclosing an enzymatic synthesis technique by which 0.91 grams of l-leucovorin had been synthesized
J.A
4872-77 ( office action detailing rejection over Lilias Rees et al. Asymmetric Reduction of Dihydrofolate Using Dihydrofolate Reductase and Chiral Boron-Containing Compounds 42_Tetrahedron_117 -136 ( 1986 ) ( `` Rees '' ) )
The applicants responded by adding new claims including what later issued as claims 5-9 and by emphasizing the specific claim limitations relating to quantities of the specified mixture which were allegedly not disclosed by the prior_art
J.A
4901-05
After a final office action rejecting the claims the applicants appealed to the U.S._Patent and Trademark Office 's Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences ( `` the Board '' ) again emphasizing that the quantity limitations could not be met by Rees
J.A
4971 4993-98
The patent eventually issued with the University of Strathclyde listed as the assignee

*1331 Spectrum as the exclusive licensee of the ¡¬829_patent holds the approved New Drug Application for a levoleucovorin formulation and accordingly listed the patent as claiming the drug_product in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( `` FDA '' ) publication Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations ( commonly known as the `` Orange Book '' )
Spectrum 's product FusilevTHE_R is indicated for the three uses described earlier

Sandoz submitted an ANDA in October 2011 seeking approval from the FDA for a drug_product that will be imported in the form of single-use vials with 175 mg or 250 mg of levoleucovorin indicated for methotrexate_rescue at doses of 7.5-75 mg per dose ( `` the ANDA_product '' )
Its ANDA contained a certification that the ¡¬829_patent was invalid or would not be infringed by the ANDA_product
See 21 U.S.C.¡± 355 ( j ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ( vii ) ( IV )

After receiving notice of that certification Spectrum filed a timely patent infringement suit in January 2012 alleging that Sandoz 's ANDA submission infringed the ¡¬829_patent under 35 U.S.C.¡± 271 ( e ) ( 2 )
The asserted claims were directed to pharmaceutical_compositions comprising a mixture of ( 6S ) and ( 6R ) isomers with at least 92 % or 95 % of the ( 6S ) isomer
The patent discloses but does not claim a process for purifying the ( 6S ) isomer from a 50/50 mixture using a chiral auxiliary group

The district_court construed the term `` said composition_being of a quantity at least sufficient to provide multiple_doses of said mixture of ( 6S ) and ( 6R ) diastereoisomers in an amount of 2000 mg per dose `` as having its plain and ordinary meaning
Spectrum_Pharm. Inc. v. Sandoz_Inc. No._2 :12-cv-00111 2013_WL_6865692 at *18-20 ( D.Nev
Dec._31,_2013 ) ( emphases added )
The court elaborated that the plain meaning required the composition to contain `` enough of the ( 6S ) / ( 6R ) mixture to provide two or more_doses of at minimum 2000 mg per dose ''
Id

After construing the claims the district_court granted Sandoz 's motion for summary_judgment of noninfringement of claims 5-9
Summary_Judgment_Order at *1
Comparing the product described in Sandoz 's ANDA to the claims of the ¡¬ 829 patent the court found that because the individual vials will contain only up to 250 mg of levoleucovorin the approved product would not satisfy the claim limitation of at least two doses of 2000 mg. Id.at *5
The court also rejected Spectrum 's argument that an aggregation of Sandoz 's approved product-that is the total amount of levoleucovorin drug_product to be imported-would infringe the claims
Id

The district_court further found that Spectrum was precluded from asserting infringement under the doctrine of equivalents because of the inventors ' statements during prosecution
Summary_Judgment_Order at *7-8
The court cited various instances in the prosecution history in which the applicants had distinguished Rees by emphasizing that the application claims ( that issued as claims 5-9 ) had `` more stringent quantity limitations '' than claim 1
Id.at *7
As a result the court found `` a clear and unmistakable surrender of subject_matter covering pharmaceutical_composition quantities less than what is required to provide two or more_doses of at minimum 2000 mg per dose of the mixture ''
Id.at *8
Because Spectrum did not raise a genuine issue of material fact as to literal infringement or infringement under the doctrine of equivalents of claims 5-9 the court granted summary_judgment of noninfringement of those claims

*1332 Sandoz stipulated to infringement of claims 1_and_2 and the district_court subsequently conducted a bench_trial only on the validity of those claims
The court found that the prior_art disclosed : ( i ) leucovorin as a mixture of ( 6R ) and ( 6S ) diastereoisomers ; ( ii ) that the therapeutic_usefulness of leucovorin derives wholly from the ( 6S ) isomer ; and ( iii ) a rationale for investigating a purified isomer product for use in 5-FU combination_therapy
Trial_Order at *6-8 *13-14
The court also found that preparations of purified ( 6S ) isomer by an enzymatic synthesis method and by separation methods had been publicly reported before the ¡¬829_patent 's priority date
Id.at *6-7
In particular the court analyzed two related prior_art references that disclosed a process for separating the diastereoisomers using the solubility differential of the ( 6S ) and ( 6R ) isomer salts i.e. fractional crystallization
See id.at *11-13 ( findings relating to Donna B. Cosulich Diastereoisomers of Leucovorin 74 J
Am
Chemical Soc ' y 4215-16 ( 1952 ) and U.S._Patent 2,688,018 ( collectively `` Cosulich '' or `` the Cosulich_references '' ) )

The district_court further found that the process taught by Cosulich would have `` invariably '' produced a mixture containing the ( 6R ) isomer as an impurity and that the data in the Cosulich_references demonstrated that Dr. Cosulich also obtained a highly pure ( 6S ) isomer compound
Trial_Order at *10-12
The court concluded that those facts alone made the subject_matter of the claims prima facie obvious in light of the prior_art
The court also rejected Spectrum 's argument that using the Rees method would not have produced sufficient quantities of the ( 6S ) isomer because the applicants had submitted a declaration during prosecution stating that the reaction could have been scaled up to produce about 500 grams of the ( 6S ) isomer per year
Id.at *15-16

The district_court then found that Spectrum did not rebut the prima facie case of obviousness because it failed to prove any nexus between what was claimed and the so-called secondary factors much less prove a long-felt need or successful licensing
Id.at *25-27
In particular the court found that the only `` distinguishing feature '' of the claims compared to the prior_art was `` the small presence of the unwanted ( 6R ) isomer '' and that Spectrum did not prove a nexus between that amount and any secondary consideration
Id.at *25
Moreover as leucovorin was not used in 5-FU combination_therapy until much later than the claimed uses ( and thus the effect of the ( 6R ) isomer was not previously a concern ) the court found that no nexus was shown between the claims and the asserted long-felt need
Id
The court found that even if there were a nexus and a long-felt need the invention would not have satisfied the need because substantially pure_levoleucovorin is clinically interchangeable with the prior_art leucovorin
Id.at *26
The district_court also rejected Spectrum 's proof of commercial success
Trial_Order at *26-27
The court thus concluded that the evidence as a whole showed that claims 1_and_2 were invalid as obvious
Id
The district_court accordingly entered final judgment in favor of Sandoz

Spectrum timely appealed to this court
We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
