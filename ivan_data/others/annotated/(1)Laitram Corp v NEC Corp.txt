Synopsis
In patent infringement action the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana A.J
McNamara J. granted partial_summary_judgment in favor of defendant and order was certified for immediate appeal
The Court of Appeals Pauline Newman Circuit_Judge held that : ( 1 ) amendments made to patent claims during reexamination are not per se substantive when the amendments are made following rejection based on prior_art and ( 2 ) material factual premises underlying interpretation of amendments made to patent claims during reexamination following rejection based on prior_art were in genuine dispute precluding summary judgment

Reversed and remanded

Opinion
PAULINE NEWMAN Circuit_Judge
In a suit for patent infringement filed by The Laitram_Corporation against NEC Corporation NEC_Information_Systems Inc. and Sears Roebuck and Company ( collectively `` NEC '' ) the grant of partial_summary_judgment in favor of NEC was certified for immediate appeal.1

The question raised is whether amendments made to patent claims during reexamination of the patent are substantive as a matter of law when the amendments are made following a rejection based on prior_art
We conclude that there is no per se rule
It must be determined whether the claims are substantively changed on consideration of the facts of the case

Accordingly the grant of partial_summary_judgment is reversed
The case is remanded for further proceedings

Background
United States Patent No._3952,311 ( the '311_patent ) entitled `` Electro-Optical Printing System '' inventor James M. Lapeyre was issued on April_20,_1976 and is assigned to The Laitram_Corporation
The patent is directed to high_speed electro-optical printing whereby printed characters are produced on a sheet of radiation_sensitive_material
As described in the specification radiation emitting elements are arrayed in a straight_line and the radiation_sensitive_material is moved past the emitter_array at constant_speed in a direction perpendicular to the line of the array
As the radiation_sensitive_material moves past the array certain of the emitters are activated so as to produce type_quality_alpha-numeric_characters

A request for reexamination was filed by a third party not involved in this suit
The patent examiner determined that the request raised a substantial new question of patentability2 as to claims 1_and_2 the only claims of the original '311_patent
During the ensuing reexamination the examiner rejected claims 1_and_2 on the ground of obviousness 35 U.S.C.¡± 103 in view of certain newly cited references
Claim 2 was also rejected as anticipated 35 U.S.C.¡± 102 ( b ) by one of the newly cited references

Laitram filed a response in which it amended claims 1_and_2 and added new claims 3_through_27 containing additional limitations
Claims 1_and_2 follow wherein the words added during reexamination are *1359 italicized and the words deleted are shown in brackets : 1
An electro-optical_printing_apparatus for printing type_quality_alpha-numeric_characters at high_speed on a surface of a photosensitive recording_material said apparatus comprising : a plurality of rapidly reacting radiation_emitters each being capable of emitting radiation at wavelengths to which said surface is sensitive said emitters being disposed in an array along a substantially straight_line said array being a plurality of rows of said radiation_emitters ; means for moving said recording_material in a single_direction substantially perpendicular to said straight_line with its surface adjacent said array and at a substantially constant_speed relative to said array and ; means for selectively activating each of said emitters for predetermined_periods of time and
means for coordinating the predetermined period of time in which each of the said plurality of emitters are activated with said constant relative speed of said recording_material so that the radiation emitted by said emitters will be recorded on selected areas of said recording surface in the form of an alpha-numeric image each of said emitters being positioned to irradiate a different_area of said recording surface the different_areas of said surface irradiated by each of the said emitters being arranged in an overlapping relationship with one another and said plurality of emitters being of sufficient number to print said type_quality_alpha-numeric_characters
2
A method of electro-optically printing type_quality_alpha-numeric_characters at high_speed on the recording surface of a photosensitive_material said method comprising the steps of : arranging a plurality of rapidly reacting radiation_emitters in a straight_line array each of the said emitters being capable of emitting radiation at wave- lengths to which said photosensitive_material is sensitive selectively energizing for predetermined_periods of time each of the said emitters transmitting the emitted radiation from each of the said emitters to a different_area on said surface providing relative_movement along a single coordinate substantially perpendicular to said array at substantially constant_speed between said recording surface and said emitters and
coordinating the predetermined_periods of time in which each of said plurality of emitters [ are ] is selectively energized with said constant_speed of said relative_movement between said emitters and recording surface so that alpha-numeric_character_images are recorded on said recording by exposure of said selected [ ares ] areas of said recording surface by said emitted radiation said step of coordinating including the steps of synchronously generating a first data signal which programs the order [ to ] of energization of said emitters and a second data signal which determines the duration of the energization period of said emitters and employing said first and second data signals to effect energization of said emitters so as to record said alpha-numeric_character_images of said type quality at said high_speed
Laitram filed a detailed analysis of each of claims 1_through_27 in light of the newly cited references pointing out how the teachings of the references differed from the '311 invention
For example Laitram explained that the movement of the paper as shown in the newly cited Baylis reference was in more than one direction relative to the emitter_array whereas the '311 specification made clear that the movement of the paper in the claimed invention was along a single perpendicular coordinate
Laitram presented additional arguments as to perceived deficiencies in other references

*1360 The examiner allowed claims 1_and_2 as amended and claims 3_through_27 as added giving the following reason : The prior_art fails to teach an electro-optical_printing_apparatus for printing type quality characters including a plurality of emitters disposed in an array along a substantially straight_line [ ] a recording surface moved in a single_direction at a substantially constant_speed in a direction substantially perpendicular to the line of the emitter_array [ ] and means for selectively coordinating the activation of the emitters for predetermined_periods of time in combination with the other elements recited in the claims

Laitram argued to the district_court that the amendment of claims 1_and_2 to include the added words was done to `` more particularly define '' the invention that the added words stated inherent details and did not change the scope of the claims
The district_court did not decide the question of whether the changes to claims 1_and_2 were in fact substantive or discuss the scope of these claims before and after amendment
The court ruled summarily that any amendment to overcome a rejection on prior_art is substantive as a matter of law
