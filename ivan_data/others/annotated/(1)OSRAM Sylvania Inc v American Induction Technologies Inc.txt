United States Court of Appeals Federal Circuit
OSRAM_SYLVANIA INC. Plaintiff-Appellant v. AMERICAN INDUCTION TECHNOLOGIES INC. Defendant-Cross Appellant
Nos._2012-1091 2012-1135
| Dec._13,_2012
Synopsis
Background : Assignee filed action against competitor alleging infringement of patent directed toward low_pressure high intensity fluorescent light
The United States District Court for the Central District of California Manuel L. Real J. granted summary_judgment that patent had been anticipated and was obvious
Assignee appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals O'Malley Circuit_Judge held that :

factual_issue existed on claim that patent had been anticipated ;

competitor did not face enhanced burden in establishing anticipation because examiner considered prior art patent during prosecution of patent in suit ; and

factual_issue existed as to whether one of ordinary skill would consider lamp shape to be irrelevant

Reversed and remanded

Opinion
O'MALLEY Circuit_Judge
OSRAM_SYLVANIA Inc. ( `` OSRAM '' ) appeals the district_court 's grant of summary_judgment of invalidity of claims 1 17 25 27 and 32 of U.S. Patent No._5834,905 ( the `` ¡¬905_patent `` ) issued to Valery A. Godyak et al. and assigned to OSRAM
*701 Because we find genuine issues of material fact that preclude a finding of anticipation and obviousness on summary_judgment and because we find that the district_court erred in failing to consider objective indicia of nonobviousness we reverse and remand for proceedings in accordance with this ruling

BACKGROUND
I
Technology at Issue
OSRAM is the assignee of the ¡¬905_patent which claims a closed-loop tubular electrodeless lamp having certain and specific discharge current and pressure parameters
Claim 1 which is representative recites :

An electric lamp assembly comprising : an electrodeless lamp including a closed-loop tubular_lamp_envelope enclosing mercury_vapor and a buffer_gas at a pressure less than 0.5 torr ; a transformer_core disposed so as to surround a portion of said closed-loop lamp envelope ; an input_winding disposed on said transformer_core ; and
a radio_frequency_power_source coupled to said input_winding for supplying sufficient radio frequency energy to said mercury_vapor and said buffer_gas to produce in said lamp envelope a discharge having a discharge current equal to or greater than about 2 amperes
¡¬905_patent_col. 8_ll._7 -19

This invention generally relates to `` a low_pressure high intensity fluorescent light source that can produce considerably more light per unit length than conventional electroded fluorescent_lamps ''
Electrodeless fluorescent_lamps were first disclosed in several patents issued to and articles authored by John Anderson of G.E
in the 1960s and 1970s
For example as described in the ¡¬905_patent 's `` Background of the Invention '' Anderson claimed in U.S. Patent No._3987,334 ( the `` Anderson_¡¬334_patent `` ) a lamp having a torodial discharge tube that forms a continuous closed electrical path that passes through a torodial ferrite_core
Applying a voltage to the wire wrapped around the ferrite_core creates a magnetic flux that in turn induces a discharge voltage along the tube
In effect the wire around the ferrite_core operates as the primary of a transformer with the lamp tube operating as the secondary of the transformer
Thus `` [ t ] he inner surface of the discharge tube is coated with a phosphor which emits visible light when irradiated by photons emitted by the excited mercury gas atoms ''
¡¬905_patent_col. 2_ll._14 -16
The lamps described in the Anderson_¡¬334_patent operated with a buffer_gas_pressure of `` approximately 1 torr or less ''
The ¡¬ 905 patent specification describes Anderson 's lamp as inefficient and impractical however

The ¡¬905_patent also describes `` a closed-loop tubular_lamp_envelope enclosing mercury_vapor.. a transformer_core disposed around the lamp envelope an input_winding disposed on the transformer_core and a radio_frequency_power_source coupled to the input_winding '' but it specifies a buffer_gas_pressure of `` less than about 0.5 torr ''
¡¬905_patent_col. 2_ll._31 -37
`` The radio frequency source supplies sufficient radio frequency energy to the mercury_vapor and the buffer_gas to produce in the lamp envelope a discharge having a discharge current equal to or greater than about 2 amperes ''
Id
col. 2_ll._36 -41
Operating a lamp at the parameters specified in the ¡¬905_patent -namely a buffer_gas_pressure of less than 0.5 torr and a discharge current equal to or greater than 2 amperes-allegedly results in a lamp with high output high efficiency and long operating life as compared to conventional *702 electroded fluorescent_lamps
In its preferred embodiment the lamp specified by the ¡¬905_patent operates with a buffer_gas_pressure equal to or less than about 0.2 torr and a discharge current equal to or greater than about 5.0 amperes
The specification of the ¡¬905_patent makes clear that it is this novel relationship-high discharge current combined with low buffer_gas_pressure-that results in the increased efficiency and small power loss in the ferrite_core
