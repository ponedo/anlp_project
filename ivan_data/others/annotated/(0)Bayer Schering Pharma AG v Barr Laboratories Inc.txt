BACKGROUND
Bayer is a large pharmaceutical company that produces the daily oral_contraceptive YasminTHE_R
One of the active_ingredients in Yasmin drospirenone is a progestin that inhibits ovulation
Each of the invalidated claims requires drospirenone as the active ingredient
Drospirenone was known in the art at all times relevant
Its contraceptive qualities are particularly well suited for producing an oral_contraceptive because in addition to inhibiting ovulation it is a diuretic which will diminish excess water retention arising from the estrogen component of oral_contraceptives and has anti-acne qualities to promote clear skin
These desirable qualities have led to Yasmin 's success
Drospirenone is also acid-sensitive
When exposed to low-pH ( highly acidic ) environments such as found in the human_stomach drospirenone `` isomerizes '' -that is the acid catalyzes a reaction that rearranges drospirenone 's molecular structure while its molecular composition remains constant
The resulting isomer is non-antimineralocorticoidal meaning it will not act as a diuretic removing the desirable anti-bloating effect that sets drospirenone apart from other prior_art progestins
Therefore scientists working with drospirenone for use in an oral_contraceptive must be aware of and work around the effects that the human_stomach will have on the drug to ensure that its `` bioavailability '' -the amount of the active drug absorbed into the bloodstream and available to act on the body-is high enough to perform its contraceptive function

Drospirenone is also a poorly water soluble hydrophobic composition
Because it will not easily dissolve into a volume of liquid its bioavailability is degraded
To combat this pharmaceutical producers commonly employ a technique called `` micronization '' whereby the drug 's particle size is reduced increasing its overall surface area
Often ( but not always ) with a larger surface area the dissolution_rate is also increased ensuring that all of the poorly water soluble drug that can dissolve *1344 will dissolve in a given volume of liquid
With more of the drug dissolved the drug will exhibit a higher bioavailability
Indeed Bayer 's expert testified at trial that this would be his first choice in attempting to increase the dissolution_rate because among the different ways to increase the dissolution_rate micronization presents the best chance of success
All commercially available oral_contraceptives use micronized progestins and/or estrogens so this technique was well known in the art

While micronizing a poorly water soluble composition may result in increased bioavailability micronizing an acid-sensitive composition may also increase its sensitivity to the acid
A drug that isomerizes when exposed to acid thus may isomerize at a faster rate if it is micronized

One method pharmaceutical companies use to surmount an acid-sensitivity problem with a drug to be taken orally is to deliver the drug via an enteric-coated_pill as opposed to an immediate release pill also called a `` normal_pill ''
An enteric_coating is a pH-sensitive film that protects the drug from stomach acid and only releases the drug when it has passed into the less acidic duodenum and small intestine
However enteric_coatings are not without drawbacks themselves
Coated tablets including enteric coated_tablets present an obstacle to absorption and thus reduce the drug 's exhibited bioavailability
Additionally as was known in the art at the time they introduce a significant delay in the onset of therapeutic response while creating a considerable patient-to-patient variation of that onset
In fact even for an individual taking the drug at different times the response time may vary considerably from dose to dose
Bayer scientists noticed these intra-and inter-individual bioavailability differences in practice in their studies on beagles and women
This presented a further complication because Bayer required the drug to be 99 % effective and work on all women at a single dose- '' one dose must fit all ''
A normal_pill may not present such variations but will expose its contents to the stomach 's highly acidic_environment

Dr. Johannes Tack a Bayer scientist began work in 1983 to develop drospirenone into an oral_contraceptive
At the time Bayer had been working with a related compound spirorenone as a diuretic
When consumed spirorenone metabolizes into drospirenone which is still a diuretic but was found to have progestogenic ( contraceptive ) effects
Spirorenone itself had some contraceptive effects that Bayer concluded were the result of the appearance of drospirenone when it metabolized
Bayer decided to harness the diuretic effect of isolated drospirenone to create the new contraceptive
Tack consulted prior Bayer work with drospirenone including in vitro isomerization studies performed by a fellow Bayer scientist Dr. Werner Krause
Krause had also performed in vivo_studies with spirorenone about which he published three articles
These studies Krause_I II and III included the knowledge that drospirenone was a metabolite of spirorenone
Tack decided however that these in vivo_studies garnered little information on the practice of drospirenone in vivo

Tack tested the stability of drospirenone in acid at pH 1 to simulate the conditions of the stomach
He found that after 10 minutes 21 % of the drospirenone had isomerized in the acid and after 45 minutes half had isomerized
He came to a critical conclusion : If the results obtained in vitro are applied to in vivo conditions it can be presumed that with an assumed gastric *1345 juice volume of 100ml the majority of the dose ( solubility of drospirenone 5-10 mg/l ) passes into solution during passage through the stomach and consequently undergoes rapid isomerization
A clear reduction in the bioavailability of the unchanged active substance is to be expected as a result
The planned studies on the progestogenic efficacy of [ drospirenone ] should therefore be performed with an enteric-coated formulation
Tack then moved into clinical studies with an enteric-coated formulation of drospirenone
For five years Bayer used this coated_pill in its studies even reconfirming in 1988 that drospirenone needed an enteric_coating because it isomerized quickly in a pH 1 acidic solution

In 1988 Bayer also planned a study to determine how effectively its enteric-coated_tablet delivered a formulation as compared to an intravenous_injection of the same formulation
This study would thus measure the `` absolute bioavailability '' of the drug
Bayer added what it terms a `` non-routine '' element to the study by which it added an unprotected ( normal ) drospirenone tablet and compared its bioavailability to that of the enteric-coated formulation and the intravenous delivery
Tack expected to find that the enteric-coated_tablet would produce a lower_bioavailability than an intravenous_injection while the normal_pill would produce an even lower_bioavailability than the enteric-coated_tablet
However he found that despite his observations that drospirenone would quickly isomerize in a highly acidic_environment and his belief therefore that an enteric_coating would be necessary to preserve bioavailability the normal_pill and the enteric-coated_pill resulted in the same bioavailability
Following this study Bayer developed drospirenone in a normal_pill for which it would eventually receive the ¡¬531_patent

Bayer relied on the finding that drospirenone would absorb with a normal_pill to overcome an obviousness rejection in the Patent and Trademark Office
During prosecution the examiner rejected the claims as obvious in view of a De Castro reference which the examiner said taught to micronize poorly soluble drugs to increase their bioavailability
Bayer responded that another piece of prior_art the Nickisch_reference taught that micronizing drospirenone would increase its exposure to the highly acidic_environment in the stomach which would result in increased isomerization
The examiner allowed the claims giving the specific reason that the prior_art suggested that micronizing drospirenone would not work : `` The micronized_drospirenone will be degraded even more rapidly because the micronization of drospirenone expose [ sic ] the drug particles in the stomach ( acidic )
Therefore to formulate an oral dosage forms [ sic ] containing the drospirenone particles which exposed to the gastric_environment upon dissolution would be un [ o ] bvious in view of the data presented.. ''

The ¡¬531_patent issued on September 7 2004
Claim 1 is representative : 1
A pharmaceutical composition comprising
from about 2 mg to about 4 mg of micronized_drospirenone particles about 0.01 mg to about 0.05 mg of 17.alpha.-ethinylestradiol and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers the composition being in an oral dose form exposed to the gastric_environment upon dissolution *1346 and the composition being effective for oral contraception in a human female

Barr Laboratories ( `` Barr '' ) makes generic pharmaceuticals and filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application with the Food and Drug Administration seeking approval to market a generic version of YasminTHE_R
Bayer promptly filed a patent infringement suit against Barr
The parties agreed that if the ¡¬531_patent is valid Barr infringes claims 1 5 8 27 29 36 49 and 50
Barr then alleged that these claims are obvious among other invalidity and unenforceability arguments
At trial the two parties agreed that 2-4 mg drospirenone was well known in the art as well as its combination with 0.01-0.BIG_TOKEN__05_mg_17__BIG_TOKEN a-ethinylestradiol a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a kit containing 21 such tablets with active_ingredients and 7 placebos to be used as an effective oral_contraceptive in human females
Bayer claimed that its innovation was that the drospirenone could be micronized to increase its bioavailability and that the micronized_drospirenone would not need to be enteric coated for protection against the highly acidic gastric_environment

The district court ruled that these claims were invalid as obvious and rejected Barr 's other theories
The court found that a person having ordinary_skill in the art would have considered the Krause_I II and III studies ' results that spirorenone though acid-sensitive would nevertheless absorb in vivo because drospirenone is closely related to spirorenone
It also found that while the Nickisch_reference did teach that drospirenone isomerizes in vitro when exposed to acid simulating the human_stomach a person of ordinary_skill would be aware of the study 's shortcomings and would verify whether drospirenone absorbed or isomerized with precise in vivo and in vitro testing as suggested by the Robert Aulton treatise Pharmaceutrics : The Science of Dosage Form Design ( 1988 )
It then held that under KSR International Co. v. Teleflex Inc. 550_U.S._398 127_S.Ct._1727 167_L.Ed.2d_705_(2007) it would have been obvious to a person having ordinary_skill in pharmaceutical formulation to try a normal_pill in formulating drospirenone as an oral_contraceptive
Bayer timely appeals this ruling ; Barr does not cross-appeal its adverse rulings
We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
