Synopsis

The United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of Illinois Harry D. Leinenweber J. entered judgment for competitor finding that all claims of patent were invalid and that certain_claims were not infringed by two of competitor 's products
Patentee appealed and the Court of Appeals for the Federal_Circuit Clevenger Circuit_Judge held that : ( 1 ) `` resuscitator '' in patent meant a resuscitator that normally allows a patient to spontaneously breathe gas that is stored in the squeezebag but automatically directs the patient to breathe ambient air through an unobstructed exit port if the gas supply to the squeezebag becomes occluded ; ( 2 ) patent was not invalid as obvious ; and ( 3 ) court 's improper claim construction required remand for new determination regarding infringement

Reversed in part vacated in part and remanded

CLEVENGER Circuit_Judge
Smiths Industries Medical Systems Inc. ( `` Smiths '' ) appeals from the judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of Illinois that all the claims of Smiths 's patent for a manual resuscitator are invalid and that certain_claims are not infringed by two accused products manufactured by appellee Vital_Signs Inc.

See Smith Indus
Med Sys. Inc. v. Vital_Signs Inc. 4_F.Supp.2d_746 748-52 ( N.D.Ill.1997 )

The case is remanded to the district_court for further proceedings
