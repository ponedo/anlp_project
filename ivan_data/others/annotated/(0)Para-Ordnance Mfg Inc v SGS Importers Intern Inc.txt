Para-Ordnance Manufacturing Inc. ( Para-Ordnance ) appeals the June_2,_1994 decision and the June_9,_1994 order of the United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Virginia
Para-Ordnance Mfg. Inc. v. SGS Importers Int ' l Inc. Docket No._94-117- A
Following a bench trial in Para-Ordnance 's patent infringement suit against SGS Importers International Inc. ( SGS ) the district_court determined that all of the claims of United States Patent No._4862,618 ( the '618_patent ) 1 ) are obvious over the prior_art and are therefore invalid under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103 ( 1988 ) and 2 ) were not infringed by SGS
We affirm the court 's determination of invalidity and do not address infringement

BACKGROUND
The '618_patent discloses and claims a `` conversion_kit '' for expanding the ammunition_capacity of semi-automatic handguns
An expansion in ammunition_capacity is accomplished for any particular handgun by providing a widened ammunition magazine to accommodate an increased number of cartridges arranged in a staggered side-by-side configuration
The kit of the '618_patent has a one-piece handgun frame with a grip_portion *1087 that is wide enough to hold an enlarged magazine

The '618_patent contains thirteen claims with one independent claim and twelve dependent claims
Claim 1 reads as follows:1

1
A conversion_kit to convert a semi-automatic hand-gun of a predetermined round capacity to a hand-gun of a higher round capacity comprising : a frame made in one piece including an elongated top_part having a constant width throughout its length and flat parallel external_side_faces each with an open-ended groove defining guides for the conventional slide of said hand-gun and a grip downwardly depending at an angle from an intermediate portion of said top_part and having a bottom_end said grip having a width greater than the width of said top_part with external_side_faces merging with the external_side_faces of said top_part below said grooves said frame having a through-bore defining a magazine chamber extending through said grip and through said top art and forming a bottom opening through said bottom_end and a top opening through said top_part said through-bore having opposite side faces substantially parallel to the long axis of said top_part and defining lower side face portions which are straight and parallel to each other starting from said bottom_end to a zone just below said top_part followed by intermediate_face_portions which are converging and in turn followed by upper face portions which are substantially parallel to each other said grooves being uninterrupted from end to end and adapted to slidably retain said slide for reciprocating movement of the latter
Para-Ordnance the exclusive licensee of the '618_patent with the exclusive right to sue for infringement,2 brought suit against SGS alleging that SGS 's Llama IX-C and IX-D handguns infringed the claims of the '618_patent
In addition to denying infringement SGS countered that the claims of the patent were invalid under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103
SGS asserted that the claims were obvious from the following items : the Colt 191145 caliber_handgun the Browning_Hi-Power 9mm handgun and the Llama Omni45 caliber_handgun
Of this prior_art the Colt 1911 a frame and magazine similar to the Browning_Hi-Power and a magazine similar to the Llama Omni magazine were before the Patent and Trademark Office during prosecution of the '618_patent
The complete Llama Omni handgun was not

At the conclusion of the trial the district_court concluded that claim 1 would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art and thus is invalid
The district_court based its conclusion of obviousness on the prior_art and the testimony of SGS 's expert David Findlay
In determining obviousness the court found that claim 1 differs from the prior_art primarily in the means used to implement the mechanical transition between the handgun frame 's widened grip_portion and its narrower top portion
These means are found in the claim limitation which refers to `` intermediate_face_portions which are converging ''
