REYNA Circuit_Judge
Mr. Herman Minkin and H & M Aeronaut Tool Company Inc. ( `` H & M '' ) ( collectively `` Minkin '' ) allege that the law_firm of Gibbons P.C
( `` Gibbons '' ) committed legal_malpractice in prosecuting the patent_application for a hand_tool called `` extended reach pliers '' ( `` ERP '' )
In early 2000 U.S. Patent No._6012,363 ( `` the ¡¬363_patent `` ) issued to Mr._Minkin the sole inventor based on an application written and prosecuted by Gibbons
The Danaher Tool Company ( `` Danaher '' ) a Minkin customer subsequently developed its own_version of the ERP based on a simple design around and began competing against the Minkin device
Minkin sued Gibbons alleging that the ¡¬363_patent was so negligently drafted that it offered no meaningful protection against infringers
In the malpractice litigation Minkin 's expert proposed alternate claim language that allegedly could have been patented and enforced against Danaher
The district_court granted summary_judgment in favor of Gibbons finding that Minkin failed to raise a genuine_dispute of material_fact regarding causation a necessary element in New_Jersey legal_malpractice cases

Because Minkin did not raise a genuine_dispute of material_fact as to the patentability of its alternate_claims we agree that the causation element *1343 was not shown as a matter of law and we affirm

Background
Mr._Minkin worked as an airplane mechanic serving in the United States Navy and as an employee of several airlines
In the 1960s he devised a tool that could reach deep inside airplane engines without disassembling external components
The ERP was designed with two pivots instead of one such that the jaws could grip in very narrow areas
Mr._Minkin drew a sketch of his ERP reproduced below :

?
In 1996 Mr._Minkin sought to patent his invention and retained the Gibbons law_firm.1 Mr._Minkin gave the prosecuting attorneys access to his sketches a working prototype and a prior_art_search conducted years earlier by an independent firm
The search revealed at least eleven relevant prior_art patents many teaching multipivoted gripping tools dating back to the nineteenth century
As a cost-saving measure Mr._Minkin requested that Gibbons not supplement the prior_art_search

Gibbons prepared and filed application No._08 /660,119 ( `` the ¡¬119_application '' ) with the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( `` PTO '' ) on June_7,_1996
The ¡¬119_application included three independent claims ( claims 1 10 and 14 ) and several dependent claims
Originally filed claim 1 was directed to a tool having two handles joined by a first_pivot and two jaw elements joined by a second_pivot
The claimed length of the long end of the handle was twice as long as the short end and the claimed length of the working end of the jaw was at least twice as long as the tail_end of the jaw

The examiner rejected all claims in an office_action dated October 22 1996 citing inter alia anticipation and obviousness under 35 U.S.C.¡±¡± 102_and_103
The examiner relied primarily on a 1903 reference she uncovered U.S. Patent No._727279 ( `` Brindos_¡¬279 '' ) disclosing tiehandling tongs
Brindos_¡¬279 was cited by the examiner for both the ¡± 102 ( b ) and ¡± 103 ( a ) rejections : original claims 1_and_4 were rejected as anticipated by Brindos_¡¬279 ; the balance of the claims were rejected as obvious over Brindos_¡¬279 alone or in combination with teachings of other prior_art references

Gibbons responded to the office_action with an amendment dated December 19 1996 ( `` the Amendment '' )
The Amendment added the following language to the end of claim 1 : `` wherein the distance between the second end and said first_pivot on each handle element is at least three times longer than the distance between said tail_end and said second_pivot on each jaw element ''
Joint Appendix ( `` J.A '' )
851
Plainly stated the Amendment required a minimum 3:1 ratio between the lengths of the components connecting the two pivots of the ERP
The Amendment Minkin argued provided for an increased mechanical advantage previously unavailable

LEXIS 135847 at *4

The examiner issued another office_action dated April_1,_1997
While the Amendment successfully overcame the anticipation rejection Brindos_¡¬279 was again cited by the examiner as the basis for a continuing obviousness rejection now including amended claim 1
The examiner stated that even though Brindos_¡¬279 did not disclose the relative lengths of the handles as claimed in the ¡¬119_application it would have been obvious to one of ordinary_skill in the art at the time the ERP was made to have placed the pivot points in the claimed locations
Brindos_¡¬279 was also cited in view of other prior_art including U.S. Patent Nos._2743,726 ( `` Grieshaber '' ) 3,384,411 ( `` Zlotnicki '' ) and 3,092,152 ( `` Neff '' ) to reject as obvious the remainder of Minkin 's claims

On August 1 1997 Gibbons filed a continuation-in-part serial no._08 /904,524 ( `` the CIP_application '' ) and abandoned the ¡¬119_application
The CIP_application carried forward claim 1 as modified in the Amendment added drawings and included a 35 U.S.C.¡± 132 declaration directed to the examiner 's earlier obviousness rejections

The examiner conducted an interview on July_14,_1999
During the interview the examiner handled a working ERP prototype and as Minkin tells it indicated that one day every mechanic would have an ERP in their toolbox and that a patent would issue on Minkin 's CIP_application
Following the interview the examiner noted on the record that she had changed her opinion as to patentability but provided no reasons
The ¡¬363_patent issued on January 11 2000 with the 3:1 pivot ratio limitation at the end of independent claim 1.BIG_TOKEN__2_Figure_2__BIG_TOKEN of the ¡¬363_patent is reproduced below :

?
*1345 Mr._Minkin through his new-formed company H & M began manufacturing and marketing the patented ERP
By 2004 major tool companies including Danaher ( a supplier for downstream retailers such as Sears and NAPA ) were significant customers
Minkin 2010_WL_5419004 at *2 2010 U.S._Dist
LEXIS 135847 at *5-6
In mid-2007 however Minkin learned that Danaher had successfully designed around the constraints of the ¡¬363_patent to make and sell its own_version of the ERP
Minkin recognizing that the Danaher tool was non-infringing as it avoided the 3:1 ratio for the pivots sued Gibbons for patent prosecution malpractice in state_court

The case was removed to the United_States_District_Court for the District of New_Jersey
Id.at *2-3 2010 U.S._Dist
LEXIS 135847 at *7
Minkin alleged that Gibbons committed malpractice by negligently drafting the claims in the ¡¬ 363 patent so narrowly as to offer virtually no protection against competitors resulting in lost-sale damages
Id.at *2 2010 U.S._Dist
LEXIS 135847 at *6
The district_court applied state law and this court 's guidance that an essential_element of Minkin 's causation proof would be to show that hypothetical alternate_claims would have been patentable

LEXIS 135847 at *12-13 ( citing Davis v. Brouse McDowell L.P.A. 596_F.3d_1355 1360-61 ( Fed.Cir.2010 ) )
The parties agreed that for such a patentability determination in New_Jersey the trial court should perform a `` suit-within-a-suit '' or `` case-within-a-case '' analysis
See Minkin 2010_WL_5419004 at *4-5 2010 U.S._Dist
LEXIS 135847 at *12-13

To prove the patentability of alternate_claims with additional breadth Minkin offered the expert testimony of Richard Gearhart ( `` Gearhart '' ) a patent_attorney
Minkin introduced two expert_reports prepared by Gearhart
The initial expert report *1346 offered two alternate_claims for the Minkin ERP which Gearhart asserted could have been patented : 1
An article of manufacture comprising : two handles each handle having a holding end a handle_intermediate_point and a connecting end the handles being pivotably connected at the handle_intermediate_point ; two jaw pieces each jaw piece having a gripping end a jaw_intermediate_point and a second_connecting_end the handles being pivotably connected at the jaw_intermediate_point ; wherein each connecting end is pivotably connected to a second_connecting_end ; and
the distance between the handle_intermediate_point and the connecting end is greater than the distance between the second_connecting_end and the jaw_intermediate_point
or
1
A device comprising ; a first_pair of parallel_arms having a first connecting end and a handle end said first parallel_arms able to swing about a first_offset_hinge said first_offset_hinge located between said first connecting end and said handle end ; a second_pair of parallel_arms having a straight clasping end and a second_connecting_end said second set of parallel_arms able to swing about a second_offset_hinge said second_offset_hinge located between said straight clasping end and said second_connecting_end ; each said second_connecting_end being capable of forming an offset_hinge by attaching to each said first connecting end ; and
a motion of said first_pair of parallel_arms about said first_offset_hinge being capable of causing a mutual motion of said second_pair of parallel_arms about said second_offset_hinge
J.A
164
Both of Gearhart 's alternate_claims notably eliminated the 3:1 ratio limitation added by Gibbons through the Amendment
The initial Gearhart expert report mentioned no prior_art except for Brindos_¡¬279 and indicated nothing about the impact of the prior_art on the patentability of the alternate_claims other than to state that they `` would have avoided the cited prior_art ''

LEXIS 135847 at *16

On December 6 2009 a 37-page supplemental Gearhart expert report was served
The supplemental report compares the alternate_claims to prior_art in the context of anticipation but there was no discussion of nonobviousness
Id.at *6 *7-8 2010 U.S._Dist
LEXIS 135847 at *16-17 *20-21
In deposition Gearhart testified that his analysis of the prior_art in the expert_reports was limited to patentability under 35 U.S.C.¡± 102 and that he had not for various reasons addressed whether his alternate_claims would have been allowed under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103
Id

Gibbons moved for summary_judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56
In granting the summary_judgment motion the district_court found that
Gearhart utterly fails to provide any sort of analysis with respect to the alleged nonobviousness of his claims and gives no opinions or explanation showing why his claims would not be deemed obvious
He makes no attempts to set forth the content of the prior_art to describe how the sample claims differ from the prior_art nor even to identify the level of ordinary_skill in the field
Indeed he makes nothing more than a bald assertion that his samples `` would have avoided the prior_art '' without explaining what he means by this how he arrived at such a conclusion or how it relates to obviousness
As such this *1347 statement is merely an inadmissible net opinion that fails to shed any light on the question of obviousness
Minkin 2010_WL_5419004 at *6 2010 U.S._Dist
LEXIS 135847 at *16
The district_court also noted concessions by Gearhart himself including that he `` had no particular opinions on the topic of nonobviousness '' and that a nonobviousness analysis `` would have taken too long and would have been too difficult for his colleagues to read ''
Id.at *6 2010 U.S._Dist
LEXIS 135847 at *17
`` Indeed '' found the court `` Gearhart admits that it would be 'very speculative ' to say the PTO would have issued his sample claims ''
Id.at *6 2010 U.S._Dist
LEXIS 135847 at *16

The district_court concluded that Minkin 's expert did not `` provide any sort of evidence demonstrating that his sample alternative claims are non-obvious
As such he has failed to provide the necessary proof that a patentable alternative to the ¡¬363_patent exists ''
Id.at *8 2010 U.S._Dist
LEXIS 135847 at *21
Accordingly the district_court held that Minkin did not carry its causation burden an essential_element of a New_Jersey malpractice claim and entered judgment as a matter of law
Id
Minkin timely appealed
