Serious bicyclists often use pedal assemblies that enable them to secure their feet to the bicycle_pedals
The effect of such assemblies is to allow the bicyclists to increase the power transmitted to the wheels by simultaneously applying a downward pushing force with one foot and an upward pulling force with the other
Clip-less_pedal and cleat assemblies offer one method of performing that function
With clip-less_pedals and cleats a rider can attach his feet securely to the pedals yet release them easily in contrast to earlier systems using straps or cages
The cleats attach to the rider 's shoes and engage the pedals which are specially designed to interact with the cleats
In most clip-less_pedal systems the rider attaches his foot to the pedal by stepping straight *1249 down on the pedal until the cleat engages with the pedal
The rider typically releases his foot by rotating his foot to the side which disengages the cleat from the pedal

Richard Bryne the chief executive officer and founder of Speedplay Inc. is the inventor and primary designer of Speedplay 's bicycle_pedals
He obtained U.S. Patent No._4942,778 ( the '778_patent ) on a clip-less_pedal and cleat system and in 1992 entered the market with a product based on that patent
Shortly thereafter Bryne was issued U.S._Patent_No._5213,009 ( the '009_patent ) which claims a multilayered cleat design
Within two years of its founding Speedplay entered into two agreements with Bryne
The first granted Speedplay a license under the '778_patent and improvements thereon while the second assigned to Speedplay all of Bryne 's bicycle-related inventions made during his employment with the company
Steven Zoumaras who held a 50 % interest in the '778_patent in return for financing its procurement was also a party to the license but he assigned his entire interest to Speedplay during the course of the trial

John Steinberg the president and founder of Bebop Inc. is the inventor of the Bebop bicycle_pedals
In 1989 Steinberg conceived the basic idea for the Bebop pedal which features a hollow cylindrical body
Over the next few years Steinberg refined the concept obtained a patent on the invention and marketed two Bebop pedal designs

Shortly after Bryne saw a Bebop prototype in 1993 the parties clashed over intellectual property and commercial tort issues
The dispute led to the present lawsuit in which Speedplay claimed that Bebop was infringing the '778 and '009_patent s by manufacturing and marketing the Bebop clip-less bicycle_pedals
In addition Speedplay alleged that Bebop was infringing Speedplay 's trade_dress under section 43 ( a ) of the Lanham Act 15 U.S.C.¡± 1125 ( a ) was engaging in unfair competition under California common law and was violating the California Business and Professions Code

Bebop counterclaimed seeking a declaration that the '778 and '009_patent s were invalid that they were not infringed by Bebop 's products and that Bebop 's products did not infringe Speedplay 's trade_dress
Bebop also sought relief for alleged unfair competition and intentional interference with prospective economic advantage
While the case was pending Bryne was issued U.S._Patent_No._5606,894 ( the '894_patent ) on a clip-less bicycle pedal and Speedplay amended its complaint to add an allegation of infringement of the '894_patent
Bebop responded by alleging that the '894_patent was invalid and that all three patents were unenforceable because of inequitable conduct

Following a 10-day bench trial the trial court entered judgment against Speedplay on all the claims in its amended complaint
With respect to Bebop 's counterclaims the court held the '894_patent invalid because the invention was on sale more than one year before the patent application was filed
See 35 U.S.C.¡± 102 ( b )
The court denied relief to Bebop however on its state law claims on its request to hold Speedplay 's other two patents invalid and all three patents unenforceable and on its request for attorney_fees
Both parties appealed

II
Bebop raises a threshold issue concerning Speedplay 's right to bring an action for infringement of the '778 '009 and '894_patent s in its own_name
The trial judge concluded that Bryne had transferred `` all right title and interest to the inventions '' to Speedplay thereby securing to Speedplay the right to sue individually for infringement of the patents
We agree that Speedplay has standing to maintain this suit

A party may bring an action for patent infringement only if it is the `` patentee '' i.e. if it owns the patent either by *1250 issuance or by assignment
See 35 U.S.C.¡±¡± 100 ( d ) 261 281
A party that has been granted all substantial_rights under the patent is considered the owner regardless of how the parties characterize the transaction that conveyed those rights
Thus in Vaupel Textilmaschinen KG v. Meccanica Euro Italia S.P.A. 944_F.2d_870 874 873-76 20_USPQ2d_1045 1048 1047-50 ( Fed.Cir.1991 ) this court held that the proper focus is on `` the substance of what was granted '' and that the grantee of an exclusive license could sue in its own_name without joining the grantor if the license had the effect of conveying all substantial_rights in the patent to the licensee

Speedplay asserts that it obtained all substantial_rights in the '778 '009 and '894_patent s from Bryne and that it may therefore sue for infringement in its own_name
To support that assertion Speedplay must produce a written instrument documenting the transfer of proprietary rights in the patents
See 35 U.S.C.¡± 261 ; Enzo APA & Son Inc. v. Geapag A.G. 134_F.3d_1090 1093 45_USPQ2d_1368 1370-71 ( Fed.Cir.1998 )
Speedplay relies on two documents a Contribution and License Agreement and a Confidentiality and Inventions Agreement to support its assertion of patent rights
Bebop contends that those two documents are insufficient to allow Speedplay to sue in its own_name
