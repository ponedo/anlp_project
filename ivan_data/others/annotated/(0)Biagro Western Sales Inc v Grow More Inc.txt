Synopsis
Background : Assignee and licensee of patent for a phosphorus_fertilizer brought infringement action against licensee 's competitor
The United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of California Robert E. Coyle Senior District Judge entered summary_judgment in favor of competitor and plaintiffs appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Plager Senior_Circuit_Judge held that :

amount of phosphorous-containing acid in claim_limitation referred to amount of phosphorous-containing acid actually present in the final_fertilizer_product not to a chemical equivalent amount ;

`` phosphorous-containing acid or salt '' in claim language referred to an aggregate_amount ; and

patentee presumptively surrendered any equivalents with respect to the amount of phosphorous-containing acid or salt present by making narrowing amendment during reexamination

Affirmed

Opinion
PLAGER Senior_Circuit_Judge
In this patent infringement case Biagro Western Sales Inc. ( `` Biagro '' ) and The Regents of the University of California ( `` The Regents '' ) sued Grow More Inc. ( `` Grow More '' ) in the United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of California
At issue is U.S. Patent No._5830,255 ( `` the '255_patent `` ) which is entitled `` Formulation of Phosphorus Fertilizer for Plants ''
The Regents are the assignee and Biagro is the exclusive_licensee of the '255_patent

On cross-motions for summary_judgment the trial_court held that Grow More did not literally infringe the claims of the patent
The trial_court further held that there was no infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
Judgment was awarded to Grow More
We affirm the judgment of the trial_court

BACKGROUND
The United States Patent and Trademark Office ( `` PTO '' ) issued the '255_patent on November 3 1998
At the request of The Regents to whom the patent had been assigned the PTO undertook a reexamination and issued a reexamination certificate on July_11,_2000
As a result of the reexamination all of the independent_claims were amended by adding a limitation originally in several dependent claims relating to the amount of phosphorous-containing acid or salt thereof in the fertilizer formulation

After reexamination claim 1 representative of the independent_claims of the '255_patent read : A concentrated phosphorus_fertilizer comprising a buffered composition comprising at least one phosphorous-containing acid or salt thereof such that when said composition is diluted with water having a pH of about 6.5 at a ratio of about 1 part fertilizer to about 40 parts water there is formed a substantially fully solubilized use-dilution fertilizer having a foliage-acceptable pH for phosphorus uptake and wherein said phosphorous-containing acid or salt thereof is present in an amount of about 30 to about 40 weight_percent
The emphasized language was added during reexamination to distinguish the claimed invention over prior art
That added limitation is the focus of the dispute in this case

The term `` phosphorous '' is an adjectival modifier describing certain compounds containing the element phosphorus ( P )
In the patent the term `` phosphorous-containing acid '' is used to refer to a group of acids that includes phosphorous_acid ( H3PO3 ) among other acids
'255_patent col._3,_ll._56-60
The patent also states that the formulations in the patent are expressed in terms of weight-to-volume instead of weight-to-weight and therefore the term `` weight_percent '' as used in the claims refers to a weight-to-volume percentage
Id.at col._6,_l._67

Grow More 's accused product is a phosphorus_fertilizer named Phos-Pro
Phos- *1300 Pro is made by mixing phosphorous_acid ( H3PO3 ) with potassium hydroxide ( KOH ) and water
The reaction results in a solution containing two phosphorous_acid salts-dipotassium monohydrogen phosphite ( K2HPO3 ) and potassium dihydrogen phosphite ( KH2PO3 ) referred to in abbreviated form as dipotassium_phosphite and potassium_phosphite
A third phosphite tripotassium_phosphite ( K3PO3 ) is present in trace amounts
However and importantly the final Phos-Pro product does not contain any phosphorous_acid as such

Biagro as the exclusive_licensee of the '255_patent filed this patent infringement suit against Grow More in July 2000 shortly after the PTO completed reexamination of the patent
Grow More filed counterclaims for declaratory judgments of non-infringement and invalidity and for unfair_competition under California state law
The Regents were eventually joined as a plaintiff.1

The parties filed cross-motions for summary_judgment on the question of infringement
At issue was the meaning of the added limitation specifying that in the claimed fertilizer composition there was a `` phosphorous-containing acid or salt thereof.. present in an amount of about 30 to about 40 weight_percent ''
Biagro argued that the limitation can be met in an accused product by calculating a 'chemical equivalent ' amount of phosphorous-containing acid based on the chemical composition of the fertilizer
In the case of the accused Grow More fertilizer that would be the same as the amount of phosphorous-containing acid used in the initial manufacture of the product
Grow More argued to the contrary that the limitation referred to the amount of phosphorous-containing acid or salt actually present in the final_fertilizer_product
The trial_court construed the limitation as Grow More proposed and since the Grow More final product contained no phosphorous-containing acid held for Grow More on that issue

The trial_court concluded further that with regard to the content of acid salts in the fertilizer a fertilizer containing two or more phosphorous-containing salts comes within the literal scope of the claim only if the aggregate_amount of such salts is between about 30 and about 40 weight_percent
Based on tests and calculations made by Biagro 's expert the concentration of potassium_phosphite in Phos-Pro is 40.3 % and the concentration of dipotassium_phosphite is 19.0 %
Grow More 's calculations indicated the phosphite content to be slightly higher based on a different specific gravity used to convert weight-to-weight_percentages to weight-to-volume_percentages
According to Grow More 's calculations the weight-to-volume_percentages are 42.2 % for potassium_phosphite and 19.9 % for dipotassium_phosphite
Thus the total phosphite concentration in the accused product is between 59.3 % and 62.1 % depending on which party 's calculations are used

Since the aggregate concentration of the two phosphites in the accused product is at least 59.3 % weight_percent well outside the claimed range and thus not literally infringing the question was whether the amount of salts could be considered infringing under the doctrine of equivalents that is whether 60 ( +/- ) % could be considered the equivalent of about 30 to about 40 %
The trial_court chose not to address that question but instead held for Grow More on the ground that in light of the amended claims prosecution history estoppel acted as a complete bar to a claim of *1301 infringement under the doctrine of equivalents according to this court 's en banc_decision in Festo_Corp. v. Shoketsu_Kinzoku_Kogyo_Kabushiki_Co. 234_F.3d_558_(Fed.Cir.2000) ( en banc ) ( `` Festo I `` ) the law in effect at the time
The trial_court granted judgment for Grow More
Biagro_W._Sales Inc. v. Grow More Inc. No
CV-F-00-6105 ( E.D.Cal
Oct._18,_2001 )

Biagro filed two motions for reconsideration directed to the issue of whether a proper claim construction should permit use of the chemical equivalent analysis
The trial_court denied both of these motions for reconsideration
Biagro_W._Sales Inc. v. Grow More Inc. No
CV-F-00-6105 ( E.D.Cal
Aug._15,_2002 ) ; Biagro_W._Sales Inc. v. Grow More Inc. No
CV-F-00-6105 ( E.D.Cal
Apr._9,_2003 )

Meanwhile the Supreme_Court vacated and remanded our decision in Festo I. Festo_Corp. v. Shoketsu_Kinzoku_Kogyo_Kabushiki_Co. 535_U.S._722 122_S.Ct._1831 152_L.Ed.2d_944_(2002) ( `` Festo_II `` )
Since final_judgment had not yet been entered the trial judge allowed the parties to file briefs addressing whether Biagro could rebut the new 'Festo_presumption ' that the patentee had surrendered all subject matter between the original claim_limitation and the amended claim_limitation
While the trial_court was considering the matter we rendered our second en banc_decision in the Festo case this time on remand from the Supreme_Court Festo_Corp. v. Shoketsu_Kinzoku_Kogyo_Kabushiki_Co. 344_F.3d_1359_(Fed.Cir.2003) ( en banc ) ( `` Festo_III `` )

Biagro argued before the trial_court that it could overcome the Festo_presumption in two of the ways set forth by the Supreme_Court in Festo_II and further explained in Festo_III
The trial_court rejected both arguments
Biagro_W._Sales Inc. v. Grow More Inc. No
CV-F-00-6105 ( E.D.Cal
Mar._30,_2004 )
The trial_court therefore denied Biagro 's motion for reconsideration based on rebuttal of the Festo_presumption

The parties stipulated to dismissal without prejudice of Grow More 's counterclaim for unfair_competition
The trial_court had previously deemed Grow More 's counterclaim for invalidity withdrawn without prejudice
Thus there were no pending unresolved claims and the trial_court entered final_judgment for Grow More

Biagro filed a timely appeal
We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
