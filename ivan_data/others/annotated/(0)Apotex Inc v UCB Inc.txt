Before REYNA WALLACH and HUGHES Circuit_Judges
Opinion
REYNA Circuit_Judge Apotex Inc. and Apotex_Corp. ( collectively `` Apotex '' ) appeal the decision of the United_States_District_Court for the Southern_District of Florida finding that : ( 1 ) Apotex 's U.S. Patent No._6767,556 ( `` the ¡¬556_patent `` ) is unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct ; ( 2 ) Apotex is judicially estopped from alleging infringement of the ¡¬556_patent by the accused products ; ( 3 ) the asserted claims are indefinite ; ( 4 ) Apotex disclaimed coverage of the accused products from the scope of the ¡¬556_patent 's claims ; and ( 5 ) Apotex is barred by laches from recovering pre-suit damages
Apotex Inc. v. UCB Inc. 970_F.Supp.2d_1297 ( S.D.Fla.2013 )
Because the district_court did not abuse its discretion in finding inequitable_conduct we affirm the district_court 's judgment on that basis

BACKGROUND
A
The ¡¬556_Patent
The ¡¬556_patent titled `` Pharmaceutical Compositions Comprising Moexipril Magnesium '' is about ten years old
The patent issued on July_27,_2004 from an application that claims priority to a Canadian application filed on April_5,_2000
Dr. Bernard Charles Sherman founder and chairman of Apotex wrote the ¡¬ 556 patent application and is its sole inventor
Dr. Sherman leads the development of Apotex 's drug formulations and manufacturing processes and has himself written approximately one hundred patent applications for Apotex
He also directs all litigation for Apotex

The ¡¬556_patent is generally directed to a process for manufacturing moexipril_tablets
Moexipril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme ( `` ACE '' ) inhibitor used to treat hypertension
Like other ACE inhibitors Moexipril and its acid_addition_salts ( e.g. moexipril_hydrochloride ) are susceptible to degradation and instability
To improve stability the ¡¬556_patent discloses a process of making moexipril_tablets consisting mostly of moexipril_magnesium obtained by reacting moexipril or its acid_addition_salts with an alkaline_magnesium_compound
¡¬556_patent col. 2_ll._53 -56
This *1356 process is captured in claim 1 the only independent claim of the ¡¬556_patent : 1
A process of making a solid pharmaceutical composition comprising moexipril_magnesium said process comprising the step of reacting moexipril or an acid addition salt thereof with an alkaline_magnesium_compound in a controlled manner in the presence of a sufficient amount of solvent for a predetermined amount of time so as to convert greater than 80 % of the moexipril or moexipril acid addition salt to moexipril_magnesium

In the preferred embodiment moexipril_hydrochloride is reacted with magnesium hydroxide or the magnesium salt of a weak acid ( e.g. magnesium carbonate ) to obtain moexipril_magnesium
See id
col. 2_l._66 -col. 3_l._5
The ¡¬556_patent explains that the reaction can not be accomplished in dry form and must be carried out in the presence of a solvent
Id
col. 2_ll._38 -45
After the reaction has occurred and the solvent has evaporated the dried material can be compressed into tablets
This process is called `` wet granulation '' and has been known in the pharmaceutical industry since at least the 1980s
