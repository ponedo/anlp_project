Opinion
Dissenting opinion filed by Circuit Judge Newman
Prost Chief_Judge
Regeneron_Pharmaceuticals Inc. ( `` Regeneron '' ) appeals from a final_judgment of the district_court holding U.S. Patent No._8502,018 ( `` '018_patent `` ) unenforceable because of Regeneron 's inequitable_conduct during prosecution
Regeneron also appeals the district_court 's construction of several claim terms and determination of indefiniteness
Because we conclude that Regeneron engaged in inequitable_conduct during prosecution of the '018_patent we affirm

I
In March 2014 Regeneron filed suit in the Southern_District of New_York accusing Merus_B.V. ( `` Merus '' ) of infringing the '018_patent
The district_court heard argument and expert testimony on claim construction and issued an opinion construing various terms
See Regeneron_Pharm. Inc. v. Merus_B.V. No._1 4-cv-1650 2014_WL_6611510_(S.D.N.Y._Nov._21,_2014)
The court also declared one term indefinite
Id.at *23-24

Merus asserted a counterclaim of unenforceability due to inequitable_conduct
It argued that Regeneron 's patent prosecutors withheld four references ( the `` Withheld_References '' ) from the U.S. Patent and Trademark_Office ( `` PTO '' ) during prosecution of the '018_patent
According to Merus these references were cited in a third-party submission in related U.S. patent_prosecution and in European opposition briefs were but-for material and were withheld by Regeneron with the specific_intent to deceive the PTO
There was no dispute that Regeneron knew of the Withheld_References during prosecution of the '018_patent
Regeneron argues however that the references were not but-for material that they were cumulative of references the PTO actually relied on during prosecution and that Regeneron did not have any specific_intent to deceive the PTO

The district_court scheduled a bench_trial on Regeneron 's inequitable_conduct but bifurcated the trials based on the two elements of inequitable_conduct : a first_bench_trial on the materiality of the Withheld_References and a second bench_trial regarding the specific_intent to deceive the PTO
See Therasense Inc. v. Becton Dickinson & Co. 649_F.3d_1276 1287 ( Fed
Cir
2011 ) ( en banc )

Following the first trial the district_court issued a lengthy opinion detailing the materiality of the Withheld_References
*1347 Regeneron_Pharm. Inc. v. Merus_B.V. 144_F.Supp.3d_530 ( S.D.N.Y
2015 ) ( `` Regeneron I '' )1 The district_court however never held the scheduled second trial on Regeneron 's specific_intent to deceive the PTO
Instead in its opinion following the first_bench_trial the court exhaustively detailed Regeneron 's discovery misconduct throughout litigation and sanctioned Regeneron by drawing an adverse_inference of specific_intent to deceive the PTO
In particular the district_court discussed Regeneron 's repeated violations of the district_court 's discovery orders and improper secreting of relevant and non-privileged documents
Based on this misconduct the district_court drew an adverse_inference that Regeneron 's agents failed to disclose the Withheld_References to the PTO with the specific_intent to deceive the PTO
Having determined the but-for materiality of the Withheld_References and drawn an adverse_inference of Regeneron 's specific_intent to deceive the PTO the district_court concluded that Regeneron had committed inequitable_conduct and held the '018_patent unenforceable

Regeneron timely appealed the district_court 's claim construction order and final_judgment of inequitable_conduct
We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
