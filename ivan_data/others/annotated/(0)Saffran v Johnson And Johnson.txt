Synopsis
Background : Patent owner filed action against competitor alleging infringement of patent on medical device directed toward treatment of damaged tissue
The United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Texas T. John Ward J. 740_F.Supp.2d_899 construed claims and after jury verdict in patent owner 's favor 2011_WL_1299607 awarded damages and 2011_WL_1306420 denied competitor 's motion for judgment as matter of law
Competitor appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Lourie Circuit_Judge held that :

term `` device '' meant a continuous sheet and excluded stents having open_mesh_holes ;

function of `` means for release of at least one treating material in a directional_manner '' was to release a drug preferentially toward the damaged tissue ;

structure corresponding to function of releasing drug preferentially toward damaged tissue was hydrolyzable_bonds ; and

competitor 's medical stents which both lacked a sheet covering the open_mesh_holes between their struts and lacked a drug affixed to their surfaces via hydrolyzable_bonds did not infringe upon patent

LOURIE Circuit_Judge
Johnson & Johnson and Cordis_Corporation ( collectively `` Cordis '' ) appeal from the final judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Texas in favor of Dr. Bruce N. Saffran ( `` Saffran '' ) in which the district_court held Cordis liable for infringing claims 1-3 6 8 9 11 13 15 and 17 of Saffran 's U.S. Patent 5,653,760 ( the `` ¡¬760_patent `` )
Saffran v. Johnson & Johnson No._2 :07-cv-451 ( E.D
Tex
Mar._31,_2011 ) ECF No._326 ( `` Final_Judgment `` )
We conclude that the district_court erroneously construed the claims of the ¡¬760_patent and that under the correct construction Cordis is entitled to a judgment of noninfringement as a matter of law
Accordingly we reverse

I
BACKGROUND
Saffran is the owner and sole named inventor of the ¡¬760_patent which is entitled `` Method and Apparatus for Managing Macromolecular Distribution '' and concerns `` the treatment of injured tissues within human or animal bodies specifically.. the way injured tissues are joined and the way macromolecules are directed to promote healing ''
¡¬760_patent_col. 1_ll._21 -24
In particular the ¡¬760_patent discloses methods and devices for treating injured tissues by sequestering particles and macromolecules in a defined space using a selectively permeable barrier

The specification primarily describes the invention in terms of a strategy for treating serious bone fractures known as complex or comminuted fractures where the bone has been shattered into numerous fragments
In such cases standard treatment may involve surgical intervention to align the bone fragments and affix a stabilizing device across the fracture_site in order to enable new bone to form between and eventually unite the fragments during healing
The specification teaches that such complex fractures often heal poorly requiring repeated operations and leading to permanent disability
See id
col. 1_l._43 -col. 2_l._16

The specification describes several cellular and molecular processes that may influence clinical outcomes following a complex fracture
For one cells at the site of injury secrete growth-promoting proteins ( growth_factors ) into the interfragmentary_spaces where those proteins can in sufficient concentrations stimulate cellular proliferation and the assembly of a `` scaffolding '' matrix between fragments that serves as a prelude to new bone formation
If the local concentration of growth_factors is too low the scaffolding process does not occur-small bone fragments instead remain isolated and are eventually absorbed by the body leaving persistent and ever-larger gaps between the major fragments
In addition when bone growth_factors diffuse away from the fracture_site and into adjacent soft tissues they can spur calcification *552 and heterotopic bone growth within the muscles which can permanently limit the patient 's range of motion
Id
col. 2_ll._17 -64

To improve the treatment of such injuries the ¡¬760_patent discloses `` a unique method of fracture stabilization and a means to restrain interfragmentary macromolecules using a single flexible minimally porous_sheet ''
Id
col. 7_ll._34 -36
For purposes of the ¡¬760_patent substances larger than about 500 daltons1 ( e.g. proteins and many drugs ) are considered macromolecules
Id
col. 8_ll._3 -6
The single-layered sheet serves as a selective barrier that blocks macromolecules and larger particles such as tissue fragments and cells yet contains micropores sized to allow free passage for small molecules ( e.g. water )
See id
col. 13_ll._39 -57
Other sheets might be designed to screen molecules according to properties such as ionic charge or hydrophobicity rather than size
Id
col. 8_ll._15 -24
Once selected and cut to the desired size and shape the sheet ( 1 ) is wrapped around or affixed to the fracture_site for example with staples ( 6 ) as shown below

?
¡¬760_patent fig._4 a ; see also id
col. 16_ll._13 -47
Because of the invention 's barrier properties the growth_factors and other macromolecules ( 8 ) produced by the injured tissues at the fracture_site are restrained and concentrated within the interfragmentary_spaces ( 4 ) as illustrated in a cross-sectional diagram of the device after implantation :

?
*553 ¡¬760_patent fig._4 b
In addition to pre-formed sheets the specification also discloses that `` the invention can be applied to the site of injury as a spray.. such that it is deposited as a thin film on the tissue.. to maximize the surface area being treated while minimizing the need to dissect and staple ''
Id
col. 18_ll._29 -47

?
Id
fig._6 a ; see also id
fig._6 b

In addition to its above-described properties the sheet can also be configured to deliver a drug or other therapeutic agent ( a `` treating material '' ) to the treatment site
In such embodiments the ¡¬760_patent teaches that the treating material `` is affixed directly to one surface of the minimally-porous_sheet ''
Id
col. 8_ll._3 1-32
In particular the ¡¬760_patent describes affixing a treating material ( 12 ) to one side of the sheet ( 1 ) through a hydrolyzable chemical bond ( 24 ) which in the preferred embodiment can be severed to release the treating material by means of water molecules present at the treatment site.2 Id
col. 14_ll._65 -67
Figure 3a of the ¡¬760_patent represents a sheet configured for drug delivery as described above :

?
¡¬760_patent fig._3 a. Lysis of the bonds occurs at a constant rate releasing a steady dose of treating material
Id
col. 14_l._43 -col. 15_l._20 col. 22_ll._4 -17
*554 Moreover because the released treating material ( 10 ) is too large to pass through the minimally porous_sheet the disclosed device can deliver such therapeutics in a spatially directed manner-generally the treating material is delivered from and then maintained adjacent to the side of the sheet facing the injured tissue as illustrated in the ¡¬ 760 patent :

?
¡¬760_patent fig._3 b

As another use for the invention the ¡¬760_patent also describes intravascular stents incorporating the disclosed technology
See id
col. 20_l._9 -col. 21_l._3
According to the specification vascular plaques form in response to microscopic injuries to a blood_vessel_wall : `` When the vessel attempts to heal neighboring cells [ secrete ] a series of macromolecules to 'patch ' the defect
If the macromolecules are not kept substantially in place they will be swept away by moving blood.. [ T ] he sooner the injury is repaired the smaller the resulting plaque will be ''
Id
col. 20_ll._14 -21
In this regard the ¡¬760_patent criticizes prior art stents consisting of an open wire mesh because the holes ( 27 ) in the mesh between adjacent stent struts ( 29 ) are so large that `` both cells and macromolecules [ ( 8 ) ] are free to move through them '' and into the blood_vessel_lumen ( 38 ) id
col. 20_ll._34 -38 as illustrated below

?
¡¬760_patent fig._8 c. The specification notes prior art U.S. Patent 5,383,928 ( `` Scott '' ) as an improvement to the traditional open mesh stent design incorporating a `` sheath that can cover the metallic_mesh of a porous stent thereby somewhat limiting its *555 porosity ''
¡¬760_patent_col. 20_ll._38 -45 ; see also id
fig._8 d. The ¡¬760_patent also observes that Scott described embedding a drug within the sheath for local delivery but explains that Scott `` does not have means to restrain macromolecules between their sheath and the vessel_wall '' and therefore can not provide `` 'directional drug delivery means ' necessary to restrain the medicine that their sheath delivers ''
Id
col. 20_ll._42 -58

In contrast the minimally porous_sheet of the ¡¬760_patent `` provides the means to restrain the macromolecules elaborated by the healing tissue as well as the ability to restrain any number of medicines in the space adjacent to the injured blood_vessel_wall ''
Id
col. 20_ll._59 -62
The ¡¬760_patent provides several figures depicting the disclosed stents in operation :

?

8e-f ; see also id
figs
8g-9e
The drawings show the disclosed minimally porous_sheet ( 1 ) wrapped around a mesh stent and positioned inside a partly occluded blood vessel containing an atherosclerotic plaque ( 18 )
The sheet has treating material ( 12 ) bound to one side facing the blood_vessel_wall ( 39 )
Tissue-derived macromolecules ( 8 ) and released treating material ( 10 ) remain sequestered *556 between the sheet and the vessel_wall while water and other small molecules ( 16 ) pass freely into the blood_vessel_lumen ( 38 )
See id
col. 11_ll._28 -53 col. 12_l._21 -col. 13_l._18

The specification of the ¡¬760_patent concludes with 18 claims reciting devices and methods for treating damaged tissues using the disclosed minimally porous devices
Independent claims 1_and_8 are representative : 1
A flexible fixation device for implantation into human or animal tissue to promote healing of a damaged tissue comprising : a layer of flexible_material that is minimally porous to macromolecules said layer having a first and second_major_surface the layer being capable of being shaped in three dimensions by manipulation by human_hands the first_major_surface of the layer being adapted to be placed adjacent to a damaged tissue the second_major_surface of the layer being adapted to be placed opposite to the damaged tissue the layer having material_release means for release of an at least one treating material in a directional_manner when said layer is placed adjacent to a damaged tissue the device being flexible in three dimensions by manipulation by human_hands the device being capable of substantially restricting the through passage of at least one type of macromolecule_therethrough

On October 9 2007 Saffran filed suit against Cordis alleging infringement of the ¡¬760_patent
According to the complaint Cordis infringed by making using and selling drug-eluting stents marketed under the brand name CypherTHE_R
Briefly the accused stents comprise a metallic_mesh with a microscopic layer of polymer that coats the surface of each strut
The coating applied to the Cordis stents contains two polymers mixed with the macromolecular drug sirolimus,3 which diffuses out of *557 the device in a controlled fashion after implantation gradually escaping through gaps in the polymer matrix over a 90-day period
The holes between the coated struts remain open as shown in images of the accused products :

?
The district_court conducted Markman proceedings to construe several disputed claim_limitations
Saffran v. Johnson & Johnson 740_F.Supp.2d_899 ( E.D.Tex.2010 ) ( `` Claim Construction Order `` )
The district_court first addressed the term `` device '' which it viewed as non-limiting preamble language that `` merely gives a descriptive name to the set of limitations in the body of the claim ''
Id.at 911
Accordingly the district_court construed `` device '' as used in the claims of the ¡¬760_patent to mean `` a device having the limitations called out by the body of the claim ''
Id
The district_court also interpreted the language `` minimally porous to macromolecules '' as meaning `` substantially impermeable to macromolecules '' in view of the phrase 's ordinary meaning and the ¡¬760_patent 's specification
Id.at 913-14
Finally the district_court concluded that the language `` means for release of at least one treating material in a directional_manner '' is a means-plus-function limitation governed by 35 U.S.C.¡± 112 ?
6.4 Accordingly the district_court held that the function of the claimed `` means for release '' is `` to release a drug preferentially toward the damaged tissue '' and defined the corresponding structures disclosed in the ¡¬760_patent 's specification as `` chemical bonds and linkages ''
Id.at 914-19

The case proceeded to trial and the jury returned a verdict in favor of Saffran on January 28 2011
Specifically the jury found that the ¡¬760_patent was not proven invalid ; that Cordis had willfully infringed the ¡¬760_patent through the manufacture use and sale of its accused stent products ; and that Saffran was entitled to damages totaling $ 482,000,000
Saffran v. Johnson & Johnson No._2 :07-cv-451 2011_WL_1299607 at *1 ( E.D.Tex
Mar._31,_2011 )
After the verdict Cordis moved for judgment as a matter of law on invalidity infringement willfulness and damages
The district_court held that sufficient evidence supported the jury 's conclusions as to invalidity infringement and damages denying Cordis 's motions on those grounds
Id.at *2-8 *10-11
Regarding willfulness however the district_court determined that Saffran had not satisfied the objective prong of the willfulness test and therefore granted Cordis 's motion for judgment as a matter of law on that issue
Id.at *8-9
Having upheld the jury 's calculation of damages the district_court awarded an additional $ 111,364,281 in prejudgment interest bringing the total award to $ 593,364,281
Final_Judgment slip op.at 1-2
Cordis now appeals ; we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )

DISCUSSION
Claim construction is an issue `` exclusively within the province of the court ''
Markman v. Westview Instruments Inc. 517_U.S._370 372 116_S.Ct._1384 134_L.Ed.2d_577_(1996)
We apply regional circuit law in assessing the grant or denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law
Summit Tech. Inc. v. Nidek Co. 363_F.3d_1219 1223 ( Fed.Cir.2004 )
The Fifth Circuit reviews orders granting or denying a motion for judgment as a matter of law without deference applying `` the same standard to review the verdict that the district_court used in first passing on the motion ''
Hiltgen v. Sumrall 47_F.3d_695 699 ( 5th Cir.1995 )
Accordingly judgment as a matter of law is appropriate if `` the facts and inferences point so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of one party that the court concludes that reasonable jurors could not arrive at a contrary verdict ''
Bellows v. Amoco Oil Co. 118_F.3d_268 273 ( 5th Cir.1997 )

On appeal Cordis disputes inter alia the district_court 's construction of the claim_limitations `` device '' and `` release means for release of an at least one treating material in a directional_manner ''
Under the correct constructions according to Cordis its products can not be found to infringe the ¡¬760_patent as a matter of law
We will consider those arguments as set forth below
