Opinion
O'MALLEY Circuit_Judge
Openwave Systems Inc. NKA Unwired_Planet Inc. ( `` Unwired_Planet '' ) is the assignee of U.S. Patent Nos._6405,037 ( `` the ¡¬037_patent `` ) 6,430,409 ( `` the ¡¬409_patent `` ) and 6,625,447 ( `` the ¡¬447_patent `` ) ( collectively *511 the `` patents-in-suit '' )
The patents-in-suit share a common specification.1

Unwired_Planet first sued Apple_Inc. Research in Motion Ltd. and Research in Motion_Corp. ( collectively the `` Defendants '' ) on August 31 2011 in the United_States_District_Court for the District of Delaware
Shortly thereafter on October 7 2011 Unwired_Planet initiated an action with the International Trade Commission ( `` ITC '' )
The district_court stayed its litigation pending resolution of the ITC_proceedings
After receiving an unfavorable claim construction ruling from the Administrative Law Judge ( `` ALJ '' ) overseeing the proceedings Unwired_Planet sought to dismiss the ITC investigation in its entirety
On November 13 2012 the ITC terminated its proceedings
The district_court lifted its stay on December 28 2012

Unwired_Planet informed the district_court that if it adopted a construction of the disputed claim_term that matched the construction from the ITC_proceedings Unwired_Planet would concede non-infringement by stipulation and file a motion to terminate the case
After considering the briefing and hearing oral argument the district_court issued an order adopting a construction that closely tracked that employed by the ALJ
Believing one difference between the two constructions to be material however Unwired_Planet did not immediately stipulate to non-infringement
Specifically because the district_court noted in a footnote that its construction excluding devices employing `` computer_modules '' did not exclude devices employing `` microprocessors '' Unwired_Planet argued that a material question regarding infringement remained unresolved

Given Unwired_Planet 's refusal to concede non-infringement Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment of non-infringement
The district_court denied the Defendants ' motion on the ground that it was unclear from the record whether the accused products actually fell within the claims as construed
The district_court premised its summary-judgment ruling on the fact that it found the distinction between devices operating with microprocessors and those operating with computer_modules to be sufficiently unclear at that stage of the proceedings to prohibit entry of a judgment of non-infringement as a matter of law
After the district_court entered that order in favor of Unwired_Planet however Unwired_Planet changed course and filed a stipulation of non-infringement after all
The district_court entered final_judgment of non-infringement as to all asserted patent claims in favor of Defendants on October 14 2014
This appeal followed
Because we agree with the district_court 's claim construction we affirm

BACKGROUND
There are three claim_terms at issue : `` mobile_device '' in the ¡¬037_patent `` wireless mobile telephone '' in the ¡¬409_patent and `` two-way_communication_device '' in the ¡¬447_patent
Before both the ALJ and the district_court the parties agreed that the claim_terms should be analyzed and construed together
Accordingly we will construe them together under the umbrella term `` mobile_device ''

The only relevant issue on appeal is whether the claims should be given their ordinary meaning or whether as the district_court found the patents through repeated disparagement in the specification *512 disclaim mobile_devices containing `` computer_modules ''

The patents-in-suit address perceived problems with the mobile_device prior art
For example the prior art `` intelligent devices '' 2 could not be updated without physically changing the devices themselves because at the time of the invention applications on mobile_devices were physically burned onto their read-only memories ( `` ROMs '' ) at the factory or were present on a ROM card
In order to install a new application one would need to re-burn the ROM or install a new ROM card
¡¬037_patent col. 2_ll._33 -40
The `` intelligent telephone '' of the day moreover was too big in size too expensive to produce and had problems with battery life
Id.at col. 9_ll._21 -25
At the time of the invention-1995-mobile_devices did not have processors that were both powerful enough and small enough to operate the devices without running into these commercialization problems

To overcome these difficulties the inventor of the patents-in-suit `` devised ways to divide the computing power between a device and its remote server '' thus `` eliminat [ ing ] the need for devices to employ full computing capacity on their own ''

At issue is whether the claims cover only mobile_devices with small `` microcontrollers '' -which facilitate communications between the client device and the server-or also cover mobile_devices that contain more robust `` computer_modules '' -which serve to localize more of the computational processes onto the mobile_device itself.3

In answering this question the district_court found that `` the specification makes clear that the invention does not encompass mobile_devices containing computer_modules ''

Feb._19,_2014 )
The district_court relied upon a number of passages in the specification that disparage the prior art implementation of a computer_module on a mobile_device finding that the `` repeated derogatory statements.. reasonably may be viewed as a disavowal of that subject matter from the scope of the [ p ] atent 's claims ''

Accordingly `` [ t ] he patents disclaim mobile_devices containing computer_modules ''

; see also J.A
9 ( specifying that `` [ t ] he patents disclaimed mobile_devices containing computer_modules '' )

In light of this disavowal the district_court construed the term `` mobile_device '' as `` a portable wireless two-way communication *513 device that does not contain a computer_module ''

In a footnote the district_court `` ma [ d ] e clear that this construction does not read out embodiments including microcontrollers ''
Id.at n. 3
As noted after some hesitation Unwired_Planet ultimately stipulated to non-infringement under this construction
The district_court then entered final_judgment from which Unwired_Planet appeals
