Opinion
LINN Circuit_Judge
Brown & Williamson_Tobacco_Corp. ( `` B & W '' ) and Philip_Morris_Inc. ( `` PM '' ) seek review of a judgment entered April_1,_1999 by the United_States_District_Court for the Western_District of Kentucky
See Brown & Williamson_Tobacco_Corp. v. Philip_Morris_Inc. No._3 :89CV-0470-S ( W.D.Ky
Apr._1,_1999 ) ( judgment ) ; Brown & Williamson_Tobacco_Corp. v. Philip_Morris_Inc. No._3 :89CV-0470-S ( W.D.Ky
Apr._1,_1999 ) ( findings of fact and conclusions of law ) ( `` B & W Opinion `` )
B & W appeals the district_court 's holding that claims 1 4 and 11 of U.S. Reissue Patent No._3 2,615 ( the `` Luke_patent '' or `` '615_patent `` ) were invalid for obviousness over the prior art.1 PM cross-appeals the district_court 's holdings that : ( 1 ) claims 1 4 and 11 of the Luke_patent were infringed2 by the Virginia Slims SuperSlims ( `` VSSS '' ) cigarette manufactured by PM ; ( 2 ) PM 's infringement was willful up until receipt of oral opinions in March and May of 1989 ; and ( 3 ) claims 1 4 and 11 of the Luke_patent were not invalid due to an alleged_public_use
Because the district_court did not err in finding claims 1 4 and 11 obvious over the prior art we affirm the district_court 's decision that claims 1 4 and 11 are invalid
Because that decision moots the remaining issues we do not address the district_court 's other invalidity decision or *1123 its decisions regarding infringement and willfulness

BACKGROUND
John Luke the inventor of the Luke_patent was an employee of British American Tobacco Co. Ltd. ( `` BAT '' ) and worked in the field of research and design of cigarettes
In the early 1980s Luke 's work was focused on using less tobacco in a cigarette and thereby reducing manufacturing expenses
His work led him to conclude that smaller circumference cigarettes burned more efficiently
Luke made several prototypes of reduced circumference cigarettes and disclosed his discovery to management
B & W a subsidiary of BAT became aware of Luke 's reduced circumference cigarettes and obtained an exclusive license for them in the United States

B & W filed a patent application covering Luke 's discovery and U.S. Patent No._4637,410 ( the `` '410_patent `` ) issued on January 20 1987
Shortly thereafter citing an error in the analysis of a prior art patent to Lephardt B & W filed a reissue application and also submitted additional references for consideration by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
After some amendments the application was reissued as the Luke_patent on March_1,_1988
The Luke_patent claims a foreign application priority date of May_24,_1985 and a U.S. priority date of July_22,_1985
The Luke_patent contains fifteen claims of which only claim 1 is independent
The only claims involved in the present litigation are claims 1 4 and 11
The central limitation in the Luke_patent is cigarette circumference which is limited to 10-19 mm
As a point of reference traditional cigarettes have circumferences of 23-27 mm

Around the time that the '410_patent issued B & W began selling a 17 mm cigarette which was eventually marketed under the name `` Capri ''
The Luke_patent discloses an embodiment having a circumference of 17 mm and the parties agree that claims 1 4 and 11 read on the Capri
Shortly after the '410_patent issued and B & W began marketing Capri PM began developing a product to compete with the Capri
It took more than two years however for PM to place its competing cigarette the VSSS on the market

On May_30,_1989 B & W filed a complaint against PM for infringement of the Luke_patent and subsequently a bench_trial was held
In its decision the district_court held that the asserted claims were invalid for obviousness and willfully infringed but not invalid due to an alleged_public_use
The district_court also held that the Luke_patent was not unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct
Both parties appeal the decision to this court
They appeal or cross-appeal each holding except for the finding of no inequitable_conduct
We have exclusive jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( 1994 )
