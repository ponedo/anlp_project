Appellant L.B
Plastics Inc. ( `` L.B
Plastics '' ) appeals from the final judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the Western_District of North_Carolina granting summary_judgment of noninfringement in favor of Amerimax Home Products Inc. and Amerimax_Diversified_Products Inc. ( collectively `` Amerimax '' )
We hold that the asserted claims of U.S. Patent No._6463,700 ( filed Jan._16,_2001 ) ( `` ¡¬700_patent `` ) were not literally infringed and that L.B
Plastics can not invoke the doctrine of *1305 equivalents in the circumstances of this case
We therefore affirm

BACKGROUND
L.B
Plastics and Amerimax both sell gutter_guards which are devices that can be attached to a conventional gutter in order to allow the free flow of water into the gutter while filtering out dirt leaves and other debris
The claimed invention relates to a composite_gutter_guard that snaps onto existing gutters

?
Fig._1
L.B
Plastics filed the application that resulted in the ¡¬700_patent on January 16 2001
The application described a gutter_guard that includes a guard_panel to which is attached a `` mesh_layer ''
U.S. Patent Application No._09 /760,557 ( `` ¡¬557_application '' )
The original claims of the ¡¬557_application required the guard_panel and mesh_layer to be attached by `` a heat weld connecting said mesh_layer to said guard_panel ''
Id

On December 5 2001 the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ( `` PTO '' ) rejected the claims submitted by L.B
Plastics `` as being unpatentable over U.S._Patent_No._5555,680 to Sweers in view of U.S._patent_No._5406,754 [ ( `` ¡¬754_patent `` ) ] to Cosby ''
In rejecting the application the examiner explained : Sweers does not disclose welding a continuous weld along the entire edge of the mesh_layer
However Cosby discloses using spot weld every 12 inches along the mesh_layer..
It would have been obvious to one having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made to modify Sweers by adding welds disclosed by Cosby and to make the welds continuous without breaks in order to create a better bond between layers and to prevent debris from entering between layers
J.A.at 121 ( emphasis added )
In its response L.B
Plastics argued that a continuous weld line would distinguish the spot welding disclosed in the Cosby prior art because it would stop debris from flowing beneath the mesh_layer and into the gutter
J.A.at 131
The examiner then allowed the claims to issue after L.B
Plastics amended the claims to require *1306 `` a continuous_heat weld defining an uninterrupted longitudinal weld ''

The ¡¬700_patent issued on October 15 2002
The ¡¬700_patent contains fourteen claims of which three are independent
Claim 1 is representative and claims : A composite_gutter_guard adapted for being positioned at an opening of a longitudinally extending generally U-shaped gutter used for collecting and distributing rainwater_runoff from the roofs of residential homes and other buildings said gutter_guard comprising : ( a ) an elongate polymer guard_panel defining a plurality of spaced filter openings said guard_panel being adapted to extend laterally across the opening of the gutter and longitudinally along the length of the gutter ; ( b ) a polymer-coated mesh_layer overlying said guard_panel in an area of said filter openings and cooperating with said guard_panel to capture and separate debris from rainwater_runoff entering the gutter said mesh_layer having first and second opposing side edges and first and second opposing end edges ; and
( c ) a continuous_heat weld defining an uninterrupted longitudinal weld line connecting said mesh_layer to said guard_panel and extending from one end edge of said mesh later [ sic ] to the opposing end edge of said mesh_layer
¡¬700_patent ( emphasis added to show amendment during prosecution )
Each of the other independent claims claims 9_and_14 similarly requires that the guard_panel be welded to the mesh_layer and that the resulting `` weld line '' be `` continuous
`` 1

Two prior art patents U.S._Patent_No._5555,680 to Sweers and U.S._patent_No._5406,754 ( `` ¡¬754_patent `` ) to Cosby are relevant and were cited during prosecution of the ¡¬700_patent
J.A.at 120
Both Sweers and Cosby disclose gutter_guards
Sweers discloses a one-piece gutter_guard while Cosby has a separate screen which the claims require to be `` directly connected '' to the guard_panel
¡¬754_patent col.6 I.17
Cosby 's specification discloses several means of `` directly connect [ ing ] '' the screen to the guard_panel
It first states that `` [ t ] he fine mesh screen [ ] can be attached by adhesive mechanical fastener or heat welded to the wire mesh ''
Id
col 4 I.65-col.5 I.1
An example then illustrates the method of `` bond [ ing ].. approximately every 12 inches ''
Id
col.5 II.40-44
Then the specification again states that `` [ a ] n adhesive can be applied.. or some other_means of attachment can be made ''
Id
col.6 II.1-4

The specification of the ¡¬700_patent criticizes prior art attachment means stating : `` [ t ] he attachment means used in other prior art gutter_guards incorporating multiple layers is generally less effective and more costly time consuming and labor intensive ''
¡¬700_patent col.1 II.27-29

On February 24 2004 L.B
Plastics filed this action against Amerimax alleging that Amerimax 's competing gutter_guard infringed the ¡¬700_patent
Amerimax 's gutter_guard is comprised of a mesh screen attached to a guard_panel by means of an adhesive hot glue which is later cooled
This glue does not soften or melt the mesh *1307 or the guard_panel
L.B
Plastics argued that Amerimax 's gutter_guard literally infringed the ¡¬700_patent because the `` continuous_heat weld '' limitation of that patent was broad enough to encompass the hot_glue_adhesive used by Amerimax
In the alternative L.B
Plastics contended that its patented weld and Amerimax 's hot_glue_adhesive were equivalent
Both parties moved for summary_judgment on infringement
The court granted Amerimax 's motion and denied L.B
Plastics 's motion

The district_court first held that no reasonable jury could conclude that Amerimax 's gutter_guard literally infringes L.B
Plastics 's patent because Amerimax 's process does not involve `` heat weld '' or `` welding ''
In construing those terms the district_court first recognized that while the claims do not define the terms a standard dictionary defining `` weld '' as `` to unite [ plastics ] by heating and allowing the [ plastics ] to flow together '' was consistent with the statement in the specification that the mesh `` fuse [ ] '' to the polymer guard_panel
L.B
Plastics Inc. v. Amerimax Home Prods. Inc. 431_F.Supp.2d_578 581 ( W.D.N.C.2006 ) ( quoting Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary http : //www
m-w.com/dictionary/weld ; ¡¬700_patent col.3 I.44 )
The district_court noted that the reference to `` fus [ ing ] '' in the specification confirmed its analysis because we have previously construed the term `` fusion-bonding '' to exclude a heat-activated adhesive that did not melt the components it was fusing together
L.B
Plastics 431 F.Supp.2d at 582 ( citing Trilogy Commc'ns Inc. v. Times Fiber Commc'ns Inc. 109_F.3d_739 744 ( Fed.Cir.1997 ) )
The district_court found that it was undisputed that the adhesive Amerimax 's gutter_guard does not melt the components that it attaches and concluded that summary_judgment for Amerimax was therefore appropriate on the issue of literal infringement

Turning to the doctrine of equivalents the district_court held that summary_judgment in favor of Amerimax was appropriate for two reasons
First the district_court credited expert testimony that while the methods of welding and gluing with adhesives accomplish the same function of joining two objects to each other they were not equivalents because they accomplish a different result in a different way since welding involves allowing the molecules of the two objects to interface thereby connecting them whereas joining with adhesives involves the introduction of a third substance
See Warner-Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chem Co. 520_U.S._17 35 117_S.Ct._1040 137_L.Ed.2d_146_(1997) ( quoting Union Paper-Bag Machine Co. v. Murphy 97_U.S._120 125 24_L.Ed._935_(1878) ( function-way-result test for doctrine of equivalents ) )
Next the district_court held that prosecution history estoppel barred L.B
Plastics from invoking the doctrine of equivalents because `` [ d ] espite its knowledge of other_means of attachment specifically including adhesives L.B
Plastics only filed claims relating to `` hot weld '' or `` welding '' the layers of its gutter_guard ''
L.B
Plastics Inc. 431 F.Supp.2d at 583

L.B
Plastics timely appealed the district_court 's judgment to this court
