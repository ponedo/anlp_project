United States Court of Appeals Federal Circuit
Richard RUIZ and Foundation Anchoring Systems Inc. Plaintiffs-Appellees v. A.B
CHANCE COMPANY Defendant-Appellant
No._03-1333
| DECIDED : Jan._29,_2004
Synopsis
Background : Former distributor of manufacturer 's screw_anchor products brought action against manufacturer for inter alia declaration of patent invalidity
Manufacturer counterclaimed for infringement
On remand 234_F.3d_654 the United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Missouri Catherine D. Perry J. found that the patents were invalid as obvious and the manufacturer appealed

The Court of Appeals Rader Circuit_Judge held that finding of obviousness was not clearly erroneous

RADER Circuit_Judge
On remand from this court 's decision in Ruiz v. A.B
Chance_Company 234_F.3d_654 ( Fed.Cir.2000 ) the United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Missouri found defendant-appellant A.B
Chance_Company 's ( Chance ) patented underpinning_system obvious under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103
Because the district_court made no clear error in its factual determinations concerning the motivation to combine the prior_art_teachings and the merit *1272 of Chance 's asserted secondary_considerations this court affirms

I
Since about 1970 Chance has manufactured screw_anchors also called helical piers for use in supporting and stabilizing electrical transmission towers
Screw anchors are elongated shafts with an earth-boring ( screw ) tip and a transversely extending load-bearing member
In 1988 Chance extended its expertise in stabilizing slumping structures into the residential and commercial building markets
Chance used screw_anchors with a metal_bracket to underpin these building foundations
The Chance underpinning method places the screw_anchor adjacent to the footing and rotates the screw_anchor to bore beneath the footing
When resistance to rotation of the screw_anchor reaches a specified point Chance attaches a metal_bracket ( designated as 30 in the Figure below ) to the slouching foundation to transfer the building load onto the screw_anchor
The United States Patent and Trademark Office issued U.S. Patent Nos._5139 368_and_5171,107 to Chance in 1992 covering this screw_anchor system
Figure 5 in the ¡¬107_patent shows the technology :

Appellees Richard Ruiz and his company Foundation Anchoring Systems Inc. ( collectively `` Ruiz '' ) became distributors for Chance 's underpinning_system
During the early 1990s Ruiz also formed various other anchoring companies and marketed systems that competed with the Chance system
In February 1997 Chance terminated Ruiz 's distributorship
Thereafter Ruiz began marketing an underpinning *1273 system with screw_anchors and metal_brackets
This new system used components from other manufacturers
Ruiz filed suit against Chance in August of that same year alleging various non-patent_claims including discrimination breach of contract tortious interference with contract and business relations and breach of fiduciary duty of good faith and fair dealing
Ruiz also filed for a declaratory judgment that its new underpinning_system does not infringe Chance 's patents and that the patents are invalid
Chance filed a counterclaim for patent infringement

The validity question focuses on several prior_art references
During the late 1980s Richard Fuller and Stan Rupiper used screw_anchors for underpinning existing structural_foundations
Fuller and Rupiper used a concrete_haunch not a metal_bracket to transfer the load of the foundation to the screw_anchor ( the `` Fuller-Rupiper_method '' )
Gregory 's U.S. Patent Nos._4911 580_and_4765,777 claim an apparatus and system for underpinning structural_foundations using a push_pier and a metal_bracket
In the Gregory_system the metal_bracket transfers the foundation load to the push_pier which is driven into the ground to supply the necessary foundational support
The push_pier relies on soil friction to supply that support
Figure 6 of the ¡¬580_patent shows this technology :

The scope of the claims in this case is not at issue in this appeal because the parties agree that the claims are infringed or invalidated by the use of a screw_anchor in conjunction with a metal_bracket to underpin a foundation
Additional information *1274 concerning the claims and the other aspects of this case appear in this court 's opinion in Ruiz v. A.B
Chance Co. 234_F.3d_654 ( Fed.Cir.2000 )
Examination of the prior_art shows that the Fuller-Rupiper_method discloses the screw_anchor component of the claims ; the Gregory_system discloses the metal_bracket component in the claims
Thus this appeal is properly focused on the motivation to combine those teachings as well as any secondary_considerations that might inform the obviousness_analysis

The district_court granted summary judgment in favor of Chance on all of Ruiz 's non-patent_claims in April 1999
On the patent_claims the district_court held a Markman hearing to construe the claims and a bench trial to decide the issues of infringement and validity
At the time of trial the scope of the case had narrowed to focus on claims 1-BIG_TOKEN__4_and_6__BIG_TOKEN -8 of the ¡¬368_patent and claims 1-BIG_TOKEN__4_and_6__BIG_TOKEN -8 of the ¡¬107_patent
After the trial the district_court entered its judgment from the bench that Ruiz 's product infringes the patent_claims to the tune of $ 540,000 in damages
Nonetheless the trial court determined that the claims are invalid under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103 in light of the Gregory_patents and the Fuller-Rupiper_method

This court heard the appeal from that judgment and affirmed every holding of the district_court except the finding of obviousness
In Ruiz 234 F.3d at 660 this court remanded the case to the district_court for further examination of obviousness
This court issued the following instructions : On remand we instruct the district_court to make specific Graham findings on : 1 ) the reason suggestion or motivation present in the prior_art in the knowledge of one of skill in the art or in the problem of foundation settling which clearly and particularly would lead one of ordinary_skill in the art to combine screw_anchors with metal_brackets ; 2 ) the level of ordinary_skill in the art ; and 3 ) whether and to what extent evidence of secondary consideration such as commercial_success long felt but unresolved need failure of others copying and unexpected results is probative in the obviousness_analysis
Id

The district_court invited additional briefing and oral argument on the remand issues
Having reconsidered the evidence of the case the district_court again found the relevant claims invalid as obvious and issued an opinion outlining its factual findings according to this court 's instructions
Of particular significance the district_court found the motivation to combine the teachings of the Gregory_patents and the Fuller-Rupiper_method in the nature of the problem of underpinning foundations itself explaining : The Rupiper_method and the Gregory_patent can be combined in either of two ways to reach the same result as the method covered by the patents in issue here : by replacing the concrete_haunch of the Rupiper_method with the bracket of the Gregory_patent or by replacing the straight piling of the Gregory_patent with the screw_anchor of the Rupiper_method
The evidence in this case showed that there was reason suggestion or motivation to make these combinations..
The problem is the same : how to underpin an unstable foundation of an existing building

The district_court also discounted Chance 's proffered objective evidence of commercial_success and skepticism of experts as weak
Specifically the district_court found that the alleged skepticism of Chance 's system by Rupiper was merely an acknowledgement that Rupiper 's concrete_haunch worked better than a metal_bracket in seismic areas such as California
*1275 The record indeed does not show that Rupiper doubted that Chance 's system would work in general
In addition the district_court attributed Chance 's commercial_success to its background and experience in screw_anchors rather than any inventive features of the screw_anchor-metal_bracket system as a whole

Chance now appeals again arguing that the district_court as it did in its original judgment employed hindsight to find obviousness
Specifically this appeal involves two challenges to the district_court 's obviousness determination : 1 ) whether the district_court clearly erred in finding an implied motivation to combine the prior_art_teachings in the nature of the problem of underpinning existing foundations and 2 ) whether the district_court clearly erred in discounting Chance 's evidence of secondary_considerations
Jurisdiction over this appeal is proper under 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295
