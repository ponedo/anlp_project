BACKGROUND
The '615 and the '393_patent s have essentially the same specification and are directed to systems and methods for designing creating and importing data into a viewable_form on a computer so that a user can manipulate the form data and create viewable_forms and reports
'615_patent at Abstract
The preferred embodiment in the specification describes a data_processing_system which has three main components : a form_file a data_file and a viewer
Id.at 3:4-31 Fig._1
The form_file is created using in-house form development tools and is designed to model the physical characteristics of an existing form including the calculations and rule_conditions required to fill in the form
Id.at 3:5-14
The data_file referred to as the Aatrix Universal File ( `` AUF '' ) allows data from third-party applications to be `` seamlessly imported '' into the form_file program to populate the form fields
Id.at 3:14-22
The viewer generates a report by merging the data in the AUF file with the fields in the form_file performing calculations on the data and allowing the user to review and change the field values
Id.at 3:24-31
Claim 1 of the '615_patent is representative ( emphases added ) : 1
A data_processing_system for designing creating and importing data into a viewable_form viewable by the user of the data_processing_system comprising : ( a ) a form_file that models the physical representation of an original paper *1124 form and establishes the calculations and rule_conditions required to fill in the viewable_form ; ( b ) a form_file creation program that imports a background_image from an original_form allows a user to adjust and test-print the background_image and compare the alignment of the original_form to the background test-print and creates the form_file ; ( c ) a data_file containing data from a user application for populating the viewable_form ; and
( d ) a form viewer program operating on the form_file and the data_file to perform calculations allow the user of the data_processing_system to review and change the data and create viewable_forms and reports

Aatrix sued Green_Shades Software Inc. ( `` Green_Shades '' ) for infringement of the '615 and '393_patent s. Green_Shades moved to dismiss the complaint under Rule 12 ( b ) ( 6 )
It argued all claims in the asserted patents were ineligible under ¡± 101
Aatrix argued the motion should be denied `` to permit claim construction to go forward and for the [ district_court ] to acquaint itself with the actual inventions ''
J.A
198 ; see also J.A
5 204
Aatrix also filed declarations discussing the claimed invention which the district_court did not consider in its analysis

The district_court granted Green_Shades ' motion and held every claim ineligible under ¡± 101
J.A
33 ( holding `` the '615 and '393_Patent s to be drawn to ineligible subject_matter '' )
Though not argued by the parties the district_court concluded claim 1 is not directed to any tangible embodiment and therefore not directed to eligible subject_matter under ¡± 101
The district_court applied the Alice/Mayo two-step analysis to the remaining claims at issue
The court held that '615_patent claim 2 is directed to the abstract idea of `` collecting organizing and performing calculations on data to fill out forms : a fundamental human activity that can be performed using a pen and paper ''
J.A
23
It found that the claim elements do not supply an inventive concept
It concluded '615_patent claim 22 and '393_patent claims 1 13 and 17 are substantively the same as '615_patent claim 2 and similarly directed to abstract ideas without inventive concepts

Aatrix moved to modify and vacate the judgment for reconsideration and for leave to amend the complaint
It sought reconsideration of the district_court 's tangible embodiment analysis and leave to file a second amended complaint that it argued supplied additional allegations and evidence that would have precluded a dismissal under ¡± 101 at the Rule 12 ( b ) ( 6 ) stage
The district_court denied these motions stating that `` [ u ] pon consideration of the filings and the relevant case law the [ district_court ] sees no reason to reconsider its prior determination
Accordingly [ Aatrix 's ] motions will be denied ''
J.A
34

Aatrix timely appealed
We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a )
