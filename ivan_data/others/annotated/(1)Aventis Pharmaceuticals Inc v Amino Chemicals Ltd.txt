Synopsis
Background : Holder of patent for process of preparing a piperidine derivative compound commonly used as active_ingredient in antihistamines brought action against generic drug manufacturers alleging patent infringement
The United States District Court for the District of New_Jersey Garrett E. Brown Jr. Chief Judge 2011_WL_2175928 construed patent claims
Defendants stipulated that they could no longer prove infringement and the district_court entered final judgment in plaintiff 's favor
Defendants appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Reyna Circuit_Judge held that :

term `` substantially pure '' should not have been construed to have same meaning in different patent claims ;

term `` substantially pure '' only applied regioisomeric impurities ; and

term `` substantially pure '' meant largely but not wholly the para regioisomer of the intermediate of the structure shown as compared to the meta isomer

Reversed and Remanded

Bryson Circuit_Judge filed dissenting opinion

REYNA Circuit_Judge
Aventis Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Albany_Molecular_Research Inc. ( AMRI ) ( collectively `` Appellants '' ) appeal a stipulated judgment of noninfringement entered by the U.S. District Court for the District of New_Jersey
The parties stipulated to noninfringement following the district_court 's Markman_opinion of January 13 2011 which consolidated numerous patent infringement cases and construed terms of AMRI 's U.S. Patent No._5750,703 ( `` the ¡¬703_patent `` ) among others.1 Because we conclude that the district_court 's Markman_opinion misinterpreted claim terms of the ¡¬ 703 patent we reverse and remand

BACKGROUND
This case concerns the processes used to make various piperidine_derivatives which are commonly used as active_ingredients in *1366 antihistamines
Dr. Thomas E. D'Ambra AMRI 's president found the prior_art_processes for making piperidine_derivatives inefficient
Because one goal of Dr._D'Ambra 's work was to obtain substantially pure piperidine derivative compounds-ultimately required for pharmaceutical-grade end products ; that is end products with greater than 98 % purity-he recognized that the reduced purity achieved through known teachings meant additional purification steps were required after the piperidine derivative was fully formed leading to low yields
The prior_art_processes in short were costly and time consuming

Dr._D'Ambra 's invention overcame the deficiencies in the prior art by synthesizing piperidine_derivatives using piperidine and cyclopropylketone ( `` CPK '' ) intermediates at an earlier stage in the reaction
The processes developed by Dr._D'Ambra have the stated advantage of more readily separating out a substantially pure piperidine derivative end product if desired
Dr._D'Ambra claimed these novel methods in his ¡¬703_patent2 Fexofenadine a specific piperidine derivative can be synthesized using these methods
See ¡¬703_patent col. 26_ll._17 -33 ( claim 7 )

Dr._D'Ambra eventually assigned the ¡¬703_patent to AMRI.3 Sanofi-Aventis U.S. the exclusive licensee uses the patented processes to produce large quantities of fexofenadine which is the active_ingredient in its antihistamines marketed under the brand name AllegraTHE_R and Allegra-DTHE_R 24 Hour
The issues relevant to this appeal gravitate around claims 1 6 and 7 of the ¡¬703_patent
