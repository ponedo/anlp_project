Synopsis
Assignee of patent for bottom sheet feeder brought action against competitor alleging infringement of patent under the doctrine of equivalents

Before LOURIE SCHALL and BRYSON Circuit_Judges
Opinion
LOURIE Circuit_Judge
Sure-Feed Systems Inc. and Mailing_Machine_Service Inc. ( collectively `` Sure-Feed '' ) appeal from the July_22,_1998 order of the United_States_District_Court for the District of Minnesota adopting the jury 's finding of infringement of claims 1 2 and 8 of U.S._Patent 4,991,831 and denying Sure-Feed 's motion for judgment as a matter of law or in the alternative a new_trial
See Streamfeeder LLC v. Sure-Feed Sys. Inc. Civ
No._97-03 /RHK/FLN ( D.Minn
July_22,_1998 )
Because we conclude that the district_court erred in adopting the jury 's finding of infringement we reverse and thus do not reach the other issues raised on appeal

BACKGROUND
A
The Invention
The patent at issue involves devices known as `` bottom sheet feeders '' which collate paper and other thin materials for processing in a number of industrial applications including mass mailing printing and binding
See U.S._Patent 5,601,282 col._1,_ll._12-23
Due to its widespread industrial application bottom sheet feeder technology is a crowded art and is the subject of hundreds of patents
Streamfeeder is the assignee of U.S._Patent 4,991,831 which is directed to a `` paper sheet feeding apparatus and more particularly to an apparatus for serially feeding flat sheets of paper from the bottom of a vertical_stack of such_sheets and so on to permit subsequent processing of each individual sheet ''
See '831_patent col._1,_ll._5-9
Independent claim 1 the only such claim at issue reads as follows : 1
An apparatus for serially feeding sheets in a forward_direction from the bottom of a generally vertical_stack of such_sheets comprising : *976 means for supporting the generally vertical_stack of sheets and so that the stack defines a forward_side composed of aligned forward_edges of the sheets and a bottom said supporting means including endless_belt means and means rotatably mounting said endless_belt means so as to have an upper_run positioned to extend across the bottom of said stack ; drive means for rotating said endless_belt so that said upper_run moves in the forward_direction ; and
means including a stationary gate forming member positioned above said upper_run of said belt means and adjacent the forward_side of said stack and so as to define a nip which forms a gap between said gate forming member and said upper_run for permitting the lowermost_sheet of the stack to pass forwardly from the stack through said nip said gate forming member including first_surface means facing toward forward_side of said stack so as to engage the forward_edges of the sheets in the stack and second_surface means at said nip and having a coefficient of friction which is higher than that of said first_surface means and such that the lowermost_sheet is free to pass through said nip without significant frictional resistance while the sheet immediately above the lowermost_sheet is retarded in moving through said gap by its frictional engagement with said second_surface means
Id.at col._7,_l._48 to col._8,_l._10
Dependent claim 2 more particularly claims a sheet feeding apparatus with a `` rear support member '' see id.at col._8,_ll._11-20 and dependent claim 8 more particularly claims a sheet feeding apparatus with a `` sensing means '' to monitor paper feeding see id.at ll
