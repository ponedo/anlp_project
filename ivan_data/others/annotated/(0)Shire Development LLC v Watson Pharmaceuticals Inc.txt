Opinion
HUGHES Circuit_Judge
This case returns to us on remand from the Supreme_Court
In Shire_Development LLC v. Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. 746_F.3d_1326 ( Fed.Cir.2014 ) we decided an appeal by defendant-appellants ( collectively Watson ) from a decision of the United_States_District_Court for the Southern_District of Florida
The district_court found among other things that Watson infringed plaintiffs-appellees ' ( collectively Shire 's ) patent under the district_court 's constructions of the asserted claims
We reversed the district_court 's constructions of two claim_terms and remanded for further_proceedings

Following our decision in this case the Supreme_Court issued Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. v. Sandoz Inc. -- - U.S. -- -- 135_S.Ct._831 -- -L.Ed.2d -- -- ( 2015 ) which clarified how this court should review a district_court 's construction of a claim term
The Court also vacated and remanded our Shire decision for further consideration in light of this new standard of review
Shire_Dev. LLC v. Watson Pharm. Inc. -- - U.S. -- -- 135_S.Ct._1174 191_L.Ed.2d_130_(2015)
Because this case does not involve factual findings to which we owe deference under Teva we again reverse the district_court 's constructions of the disputed claim_terms and subsequent findings of infringement and remand for further_proceedings

I. Shire owns U.S._Patent_No._6773,720 which claims a controlled-release oral pharmaceutical composition for treating inflammatory_bowel_diseases
Shire markets these oral pharmaceutical compositions under the brand name LIALDATHE_R
After Watson submitted an Abbreviated New Drug Application ( ANDA ) seeking approval to sell the bioequivalent of LIALDATHE_R Shire sued for infringement of the ¡¬720_patent
After construing certain_relevant_claim_language the district_court found that Watson 's product infringed the ¡¬720_patent

The ¡¬720_patent -entitled `` Mesalazine Controlled Release Oral Pharmaceutical Composition '' -concerns controlled-release_oral_pharmaceutical_compositions for treating inflammatory_bowel_diseases such as Crohn 's disease and ulcerative colitis
¡¬720_patent_col. 1_ll._9 -13
The active_ingredient in these compositions is 5-amino-salicylic acid which is also known as mesalazine or mesalamine ( hereinafter mesalamine )
Mesalamine treats inflamed areas in the bowel by direct contact with the intestinal mucosal tissue
J.A
9054
Thus mesala-mine must pass through the stomach and small intestine without being absorbed into the bloodstream
J.A
9054
And it must be administered throughout the entire length of the colon so that the mesalamine contacts all affected tissues
J.A
9054
Given these requirements the oral composition must contain a high percentage by weight of mesalamine
¡¬720_patent_col. 3_ll._52 -56

The ¡¬720_patent teaches an inner_lipophilic_matrix and an outer_hydrophilic_matrix to address the limitations of the prior *1362 art systems.1 According to the ¡¬720_patent the combination of a lipophilic and hydrophilic_matrix in an inner-outer matrix system respectively is advantageous because the inner-outer matrix properties cause the mesalamine to be released in a sustained and uniform manner
¡¬720_patent_col. 3_ll._57 -59 ( `` [ T ] he compositions of the invention provide a release profile of [ mesalamine ] more homogenous than the traditional systems
`` ) ; see also id.at col. 3_l._60 -col. 4_l._5
The ¡¬720_patent also teaches the `` advantageous characteristic '' of a composition with up to 95 % active_ingredient by weight
Id.at_col. 3_ll._52 -56

Shire asserts independent claim 1 and dependent claim 3
Claim 1 recites : 1
Controlled-release_oral_pharmaceutical_compositions containing as an active_ingredient [ mesal-amine ] comprising : a ) an inner_lipophilic_matrix consisting of substances selected from the group consisting of unsaturated and/or hydrogenated fatty acid salts esters or amides thereof fatty acid mono- di- or triglycerid [ e ] s waxes ceramides and cholesterol derivatives with melting points below 90¢X C. and wherein the active_ingredient is dispersed both in said the lipophilic_matrix and in the hydrophilic_matrix ; b ) an outer_hydrophilic_matrix wherein the lipophilic_matrix is dispersed and said outer_hydrophilic_matrix consists of compounds selected from the group consisting of polymers or copolymers of acrylic or methacrylic acid alkylvinyl polymers hydroxyalkyl celluloses carboxyalkyl celluloses polysaccharides dextrins pectins starches and derivatives alginic acid and natural or synthetic gums ; c ) optionally other excipients ; wherein the active_ingredient is present in an amount of 80_to_95 % by weight of the total composition and wherein the active_ingredient is dispersed both in the lipophilic_matrix and in the hydrophilic_matrix
Id.at_col. 6_ll._7 -30
Claim 3 depends from claim 1 and requires that the composition be in the form of tablets capsules or minitablets
Id.at_col. 6_ll._35 -36

The ¡¬720_patent teaches a three-step process to arrive at the claimed composition
Id.at_col. 2_ll._48 -59
First one or more low melting lipophilic excipients2 are mixed with mesalamine during heating
Id.at_col. 2_ll._50 -53
Second the mixture is cooled to form the lipophilic_matrix and then reduced in size into `` matrix granules containing the active_ingredient ''
Id.at_col. 2_ll._54 -56
Third the lipophilic_matrix granules are mixed together with hydrophilic excipients and compressed to form tablets
Id.at_col. 2_ll._50 -53 col. 3_ll._40 -45

During prosecution of the ¡¬720_patent the examiner initially rejected the applicants ' claims as obvious in view of GB 2_245_492 A ( Franco ) ; obvious and anticipated in view of U.S._Patent_No._5593,690 ( Akiyama ) ; and obvious in view of the combination of U.S._Patent_No._5851,555 ( Sanghvi ) and U.S._Patent_No._6395,300 ( Straub )
J.A
15469-71
The examiner explained that Franco taught a pharmaceutical composition with an active core a *1363 lipophilic coating and a hydrophilic film
J.A
15469

In response the applicants stated that Franco disclosed a reservoir_system where `` the active_ingredient is confined within a core which acts as a reservoir from which the active_ingredient is released via the erosion of the outer coating
However as to the present invention the active_ingredient is dispersed in a lipophilic_matrix not in an isolated core ''
J.A
15480-81

The applicants then distinguished Akiyama based on the claimed invention 's two matrices and high active_ingredient concentration
The applicants argued that Akiyama `` fail [ s ] to disclose or suggest the two matrices and the arrangement of the matrices as set forth in the claimed invention
The arrangement of the matrices in the present invention aid [ s ] in the combined release of an active_ingredient via diffusion from a lipophilic_matrix ''
J.A
15479
The applicants also argued that Akiyama 's composition contained the `` active_ingredient.. in an amount much lower than that according to the claimed invention '' -Akiyama taught an active_ingredient in granules in an amount ranging from 0.005-75 % by weight but the applicants ' amended claim taught 80-95 %
J.A
15478-79

To distinguish Sanghvi and Straub the applicants again focused on a lack of two separate_matrices : Sanghvi `` fails to disclose a system containing two separate_matrices
[ It ] merely discloses formulations obtained by mixing together hydrophilic and lipophilic substances into a single matrix ''
J.A
15481
When discussing the combination of Sanghvi and Straub the applicants explained that `` [ w ] hile the publications might teach the advantageous results of using a lipophilic_matrix the publications fail to disclose or suggest a composition comprising a combination of two separate_matrices
In fact there is no mention or suggestion of a composition utilizing different control mechanisms ''
J.A
15482

The examiner maintained her rejection of the pending claims as obvious in view of Franco
The examiner also rejected the claims because `` the feature upon which applicant relies ( i.e. the active_ingredient is dispersed in a lipophilic_matrix ) is not recited in the rejected claims ''
J.A
15489
Further the examiner explained that the limitation-at-the-time- '' active_ingredient is at least partly inglobated '' - '' does not limit the claim to 'active_ingredient is dispersed in a lipophilic_matrix ' as alleged by the applicant ''
J.A
15489

In response the applicants maintained that Franco taught a reservoir_system but that the claimed invention `` relates to a 'multimatrix system ' and not to a reservoir_system ''
J.A
15492 ; see also J.A
15492 ( `` FRANCO_et_al
do [ es ] not teach an inner_lipophilic_matrix or an outer_hydrophilic_matrix..
The composition taught by FRANCO_et_al
is not based on an actual matrix `` )
The applicants also amended their claims to state that the active_ingredient is dispersed in the lipophilic_matrix and added a Markush group3 for both the inner_lipophilic_matrix and the outer_hydrophilic_matrix
J.A
15491-92 15496 15499
Following an interview with the examiner the claims were amended to require the mesalamine to be dispersed in the outer_hydrophilic_matrix and not just the lipophilic_matrix
J.A
15546-50
The claims were then allowed and the ¡¬720_patent issued

*1364 When Watson submitted its ANDA seeking FDA approval to sell the bioequivalent of LIALDATHE_R Shire sued Watson for infringement of the ¡¬720_patent
In January 2013 the district_court construed several disputed terms including `` inner_lipophilic_matrix '' and `` outer_hydrophilic_matrix ''
See Shire_Dev
LLC v. Watson Pharm. Inc. No._12-60862 2013_WL_174843 ( S.D.Fla
Jan. 17 2013 )

The district_court held a bench trial in April 2013 and issued its opinion a month later finding that Watson 's ANDA_product infringed claims 1_and_3 of the ¡¬720_patent ; that the claims were not invalid under 35 U.S.C.¡± 112 ?
1 ( 2006 ) ; and that Shire was entitled to injunctive relief
Shire_Dev
LLC v. Watson Pharm. Inc. No._12-60862 2013_WL_1912208 at *16 ( S.D.Fla
May_9,_2013 )
Specifically the district_court determined that Watson 's ANDA_product met the limitations of the claims at issue
In considering the disputed limitations the district_court found that the mesalamine in Watson 's product was dispersed in both the lipophilic and hydrophilic matrices because the mesalamine was present in both the granules and the spaces outside the granules
Shire 2013_WL_1912208 at *7-13
The district_court also determined that Watson failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the patent was invalid under 35 U.S.C.¡± 112 for lack of written description or enablement
Id. at *14-16
Watson appeals
We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
