Before CLEVENGER GAJARSA and DYK Circuit_Judges
Opinion
GAJARSA Circuit_Judge
Medichem S.A. ( `` Medichem '' ) appeals the decision of the United_States_District_Court for the Southern_District of New_York following a bench trial that there was no interference-in-fact under *930 35 U.S.C.¡± 291 between the claimed inventions of U.S. Patent Nos._6084,100 ( the `` ¡¬100_patent `` ) belonging to Medichem and 6,093,827 ( the `` ¡¬827_patent `` ) belonging to Rolabo S.L
( `` Rolabo '' )
Medichem S.A. v. Rolabo S.L. No._01- CV-3087 ( S.D.N.Y
May_9,_2002 ) ( `` District Court Opinion '' )
Rolabo cross-appeals the district_court 's conclusion that this was not an exceptional case under 35 U.S.C.¡± 285 and its denial of Rolabo 's request for attorney_fees
Because we find the district_court erred in its application of the two-way test we vacate its priority determination reverse its conclusion that the ¡¬827_patent was neither anticipated nor obvious in light of the ¡¬100_patent and remand for further_proceedings consistent with this opinion
As further_proceedings are necessary any resolution of Rolabo 's request for attorney_fees under 35 U.S.C.¡± 285 is at this time premature

BACKGROUND
A
The Patents
Medichem is a Barcelona-based manufacturer of pharmaceutical_ingredients
The company is the assignee of the ¡¬100_patent entitled `` Process for the Preparation of Loratadine ''
Loratadine is an antihistamine that is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in the popular allergy medication ClaritinTHE_R
Rolabo is also a manufacturer of pharmaceutical_ingredients based in Barcelona Spain and is the assignee of the ¡¬827_patent entitled `` Process for the Preparation of 10,11-Dihydro-5H-dibenzoa [ a d ] cyclohept-5-enes and Derivatives Thereof '' which like the ¡¬100_patent is a process for the preparation of Loratadine

Claims 1_and_2 of the ¡¬100_patent claim read : 1
A process for the preparation of loratadine consisting of reacting in an organic solvent and in the presence of a tertiary amine 8-chloro-5,6-dihyrobenzo [ 5,6 ] cyclohepta [ 1,2-b ] pyridin-11-one of formula VII with a low-valent_titanium_species
2
The process of claim 1 wherein the low-valent_titanium_species are generated by reduction of titanium tetrachloride with zinc dust
¡¬100_patent col._5,_l._59 to col._6,_l._21
Claims 1_and_17 of the ¡¬827_patent read : 1
A process for preparing 5,6-dihydro-11H-dibenzo [ a d ] cyclohept-11-enes comprising reacting a dibenzosuberone or an aza derivative thereof with an aliphatic ketone in the presence of low-valent_titanium wherein said low-valent_titanium is generated by zinc
17
A process as claimed in claim 1 for preparing Loratadine
¡¬827_patent col._5,_ll._34-38 col._8,_ll._3-4 ( emphasis added )
Both the ¡¬100 and the ¡¬827_patent s involve chemical reactions generally known in the art as `` McMurry '' reactions after Professor John McMurry who described the intermolecular coupling between the different carbonyl groups in a compound using low-valent_titanium in a 1989 publication
