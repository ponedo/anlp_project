Synopsis
Background : Patentee filed action against generic_drug_manufacturers alleging infringement of patent on active_ingredient in drug approved by Food and Drug_Administration ( FDA ) for treatment of schizophrenia bipolar_disorder irritability associated with autistic_disorder in pediatric_patients and as add-on treatment for depression
Manufacturers counterclaimed alleging that claims were invalid for obviousness and obviousness-type double patenting
The United_States_District_Court for the District of New_Jersey Mary L. Cooper J. 2010_WL_4596324 sustained validity of asserted claims of patent after bench_trial
Defendants appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Lourie Circuit_Judge held that :

carbostyrils could not be considered prior_art ;

patent was not obvious based on prior_art patent that disclosed unsubstituted_butoxy compound and `` laundry list '' of potential central nervous system controlling effects from carbostyril ;

patent was not obvious based on prior_art declaration that disclosed three sets of test_data comparing carbostyril_derivatives on mice ;

manufacturers did not prove by clear and convincing_evidence that patent was obvious based on prior_art foreign patent application ;

patent was not obvious based on patentee 's own prior_art development compound ; and

person of ordinary_skill would not have been motivated to pursue 2,3-dichloro substitution on phenyl_ring as would have been required to convert unsubstituted_butoxy to aripiprazole

( collectively the `` Defendants '' ) appeal from the final decision of the United_States_District_Court for the District of New_Jersey sustaining the validity of the asserted claims of U.S. Patent 5,006,528 ( the `` ¡¬528_patent `` ) under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103 and under the doctrine of nonstatutory double patenting
We affirm

BACKGROUND
Schizophrenia is a debilitating mental disease affecting about one percent of the human population
Despite extensive research the cause mechanism and etiology of schizophrenia remain unknown
Individuals with schizophrenia suffer from positive_symptoms negative_symptoms and cognitive deficits
Positive symptoms include hallucinations and delusions
Negative symptoms include flat affect poverty *1284 of speech inability to experience pleasure lack of desire to form relationships and lack of motivation

Drugs that treat schizophrenia are called antipsychotics
The first antipsychotic drug chlorpromazine was discovered by accident in the early 1950s
Subsequent research revealed that chlorpromazine 's antipsychotic properties were due to its antagonism ( blocking ) of dopamine receptors in the brain
That finding resulted in the development of other `` typical '' antipsychotics which treat positive_symptoms but not negative_symptoms and have a number of problematic side effects including extrapyramidal symptoms ( `` EPS '' ) tardive dyskinesia prolactin elevation ( hyperprolactinemia ) and sudden decrease in blood pressure ( orthostatic_hypotension )
The United States Food and Drug_Administration ( `` FDA '' ) last approved a typical antipsychotic in 1975
Despite their drawbacks typical_antipsychotics are still used today

Researchers discovered clozapine in the early 1960s
Clozapine was the first `` atypical '' antipsychotic in that it had a diminished propensity to cause EPS and was useful for treating both positive and negative_symptoms of schizophrenia
Clozapine had serious potential side effects however including orthostatic_hypotension frank hypotension and agranulocytosis ( a life-threatening decrease in white blood cells )
Due to those side effects clozapine was withdrawn from clinical trials in the 1970s prompting scientists to seek an atypical antipsychotic drug similar to clozapine with respect to efficacy but lacking its toxicity and side effects
Researchers ' efforts were largely unsuccessful however and the FDA approved no new antipsychotic drugs between 1976_and_1989
The FDA finally approved clozapine in 1990 but only for treatment-resistant or treatment-intolerant patients subject to rigorous blood testing

The FDA approved risperidone the first postclozapine atypical antipsychotic in 1994
Since then the FDA has approved seven other_atypical_antipsychotics : olanzapine ( 1996 ) ; quetiapine ( 1997 ) ; ziprasidone ( 2001 ) ; aripiprazole ( 2002 ) ; paliperidone ( 2007 ) ; asenapine ( 2009 ) ; and iloperidone ( 2009 )
Although clozapine remains the `` gold standard '' with respect to efficacy the other_atypical_antipsychotics are considered at least as effective as typical_antipsychotics for treating positive_symptoms while also treating negative_symptoms and causing fewer EPS side effects
Every FDA-approved atypical antipsychotic has a chemical_structure related either to clozapine or risperidone with the sole exception of aripiprazole-the compound at issue in the present appeal

Aripiprazole is the active_ingredient in the antipsychotic drug marketed by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. ( `` Otsuka '' ) under the brand name AbilifyTHE_R
The culmination of several decades of drug development efforts AbilifyTHE_R was approved in 2002 by the FDA and is marketed for the treatment of schizophrenia bipolar_disorder irritability associated with autistic_disorder in pediatric_patients and as an add-on treatment for depression
AbilifyTHE_R has been commercially successful ; since 2005 its annual sales have exceeded a billion dollars and in 2009 its sales were $ 3.3 billion

Aripiprazole has the chemical_name 7- { 4- [ 4- ( 2 3-dichlorophenyl ) -1-piperazinyl ] -butoxy } -3,4-dihydrocarbostyril and has the following_chemical_structure :

*1285 aripiprazole
Otsuka Pharm Co. v. Sandoz Inc. No._3 :07-cv-1000 2010_WL_4596324 at *4-5 2010 U.S._Dist
LEXIS 132595 at *15 ( D.N.J
Nov._15,_2010 )
Aripiprazole is a `` carbostyril_derivative '' that is its chemical_structure contains a quinolinone fused ring ( labeled as `` 3,4-dihydrocarbostyril '' in the structure above )
Aripiprazole 's carbostyril ring is referred to as `` 3,4-dihydro '' because it has two hydrogen atoms ( not shown in the structure above ) connected to the 3_and_4 positions and thus has a single bond between these two carbon_atoms
In contrast a `` carbostyril '' moiety has only one hydrogen atom at the 3_and_4 positions and a resulting double bond between the carbon_atoms
Researchers refer to both variants as `` carbostyril_derivatives ''
Connected to the 7-position of aripiprazole 's carbostyril_core is a `` butoxy_linker '' consisting of four methylene ( -CH2- ) units
A `` propoxy linker '' in contrast consists of only three methylene units
Connected to aripiprazole 's butoxy_linker is a piperazine_ring and a phenyl_ring
The terminal phenyl_ring of aripiprazole is `` 2,3-dichloro '' substituted meaning that it has chlorine atoms connected to the 2_and_3 positions
Otsuka is the assignee of the ¡¬528_patent which has a foreign priority date of October 31 1988 was filed on October 20 1989 and issued on April_9,_1991
The exclusivity afforded by the ¡¬528_patent including a five-year patent term extension and a six-month period of pediatric exclusivity will expire on April_20,_2015

Ex Parte Reexamination Certificate ¡¬528_patent col.2 ll.13-16

The Defendants and several other companies submitted Abbreviated New Drug Application ( `` ANDA '' ) filings to the FDA for approval to engage in the commercial manufacture use or sale of generic aripiprazole products
Otsuka brought actions against these generic_drug_manufacturers for patent infringement ; most of those actions were consolidated into the case *1286 now before us on appeal
See Otsuka 2010_WL_4596324 at *1 2010 U.S._Dist
LEXIS 132595 at *3-5
Otsuka asserted that the Defendants infringed claims 12 17 and 23 of the ¡¬528_patent under 35 U.S.C.¡± 271 ( e ) ( 2 ) ( A )
The Defendants conceded that their ANDA filings constituted literal infringement but asserted in defense and counterclaimed that the claims were invalid for obviousness and obviousness-type double patenting.1

The district_court held a bench_trial from August 5 through August 26 2010 and heard closing arguments on October 21 2010
The court entered its Amended Memorandum Opinion on December 15 2010
See id.at *1 2010 U.S._Dist
LEXIS 132595 at *5

On the issue of obviousness under ¡± 103 the court concluded that the Defendants failed to prove by clear and convincing_evidence that the asserted claims would have been obvious to one of ordinary_skill
In its analysis the court considered the known carbostyril_derivatives with particular emphasis on the three purported `` lead_compounds '' asserted by the Defendants
Id.at *17 2010 U.S._Dist
LEXIS 132595 at *53

The first of the Defendants ' alleged lead_compounds is 7- [ 4- ( 4-phenylpiperazinyl ) -butoxy ] -3,4-dihydrocarbostyril which has the following_chemical_structure :

?
`` unsubstituted_butoxy '' Br
Defs.-Appellants Apotex at 12
The parties refer to this compound as the `` unsubstituted_butoxy '' because its phenyl_ring is unsubstituted and it has a butoxy_linker connecting the 7-position of its carbostyril_core to its piperazine_ring
The unsubstituted_butoxy is disclosed and claimed in Otsuka 's earlier U.S. Patent 4,734,416 ( the `` ¡¬416_patent `` ) which the parties agree is prior_art to the ¡¬528_patent
The ¡¬416_patent issued on March_29,_1988 and expired on March_29,_2005
Entitled `` Pharmaceutically Useful Carbostyril Derivatives '' the ¡¬416_patent teaches a broad genus encompassing `` approximately nine trillion compounds ''
Otsuka 2010_WL_4596324 at *3 2010 U.S._Dist
LEXIS 132595 at *12
The ¡¬416_patent discloses that `` [ c ] arbostyril derivatives having antihistaminic action and central nervous controlling action are useful as antihistaminic agents or central nervous controlling agents ''
¡¬416_patent abstract
The patent further discloses that the compounds : are useful for central nervous controlling agents such as central muscle relaxing agents sleep-inducing agents pre-operative drugs antischizophrenia agents sedatives antianxiety drugs antimanic depressive psychosis agents antipyretic agents analgetic agents and depressors without showing side-effects such as the feeling of thirst constipation tachycordia [ sic ] parkinsonism and/or delayed dyscinesia [ sic ] which exist with conventional central nervous controlling agents

col.3 ll.14-22
Claim 13 of the ¡¬416_patent claims the unsubstituted_butoxy using its chemical_name
Id
col.70 ll.62-63
Claim 50 claims `` [ a ] method of producing an antihistaminic_effect in a mammal comprising the step of administering to the mammal for producing said antihistaminic_effect a pharmaceutical_composition containing a suitable amount of a carbostyril_derivative '' having a general chemical formula id
col.76 ll.1-60 and claim 116 claims `` [ t ] he method of claim 50 wherein the carbostyril_derivative is selected from the group consisting of '' nine specific carbostyril_derivatives including the unsubstituted_butoxy id
col.84 ll.29-46

The unsubstituted_butoxy is also disclosed in a declaration submitted during the prosecution of the ¡¬416_patent by one of that patent 's co-inventors Dr. Kazuyuki Nakagawa ( the `` Nakagawa_declaration '' )
J.A
3792-3807
The Nakagawa_declaration discloses three sets of test_data comparing certain carbostyril_derivatives
The first two measure the compounds ' antihistaminic activity
The third involves a test for `` Activity for inhibiting jumping behavior in mouse induced by Methamphetamine and LDOPA ''
J.A
3803
Although the Nakagawa_declaration nowhere mentions schizophrenia or antipsychotic activity and despite conflicting evidence regarding the use of mouse_jumping_test_data in antipsychotic drug discovery the district_court found that Dr. Nakagawa 's mouse jumping data `` could be indicative of potential antipsychotic activity to the skilled artisan ''
Otsuka 2010_WL_4596324 at *10 2010 U.S._Dist
LEXIS 132595 at *34

The Nakagawa_declaration provides mouse_jumping_test_data for nine carbostyril_derivative test compounds and two prior_art reference compounds
The potency of the compounds is indicated with an effective dosage ( `` ED 50 '' ) value measured in milligrams per kilogram wherein a lower value indicates greater potency in the mouse jumping test
The following table summarizes the data for the test compounds
