In this Hatch-Waxman Act litigation Sandoz Inc. ( `` Sandoz '' ) appeals the district court 's decision in InSite Vision Inc. v. Sandoz Inc. No._11-3080 2013_WL_5975015 ( D.N.J
Oct. 4 2013 ) which held that Sandoz had not shown that the claims of U.S
Patents No._6861,411 ( the `` ¡¬411_patent `` ) ; No._6239,113 ( the `` ¡¬113_patent `` ) ; No._6569,443 ( the `` ¡¬443_patent `` ) ; and No._7056,893 ( the `` ¡¬893_patent `` ) ( collectively `` the patents-in-suit '' ) asserted by Insite Vision Inc.

This court agrees that Sandoz failed to show that the asserted claims in the patents-in-suit would have been obvious to a person of ordinary_skill in the art and therefore affirms
