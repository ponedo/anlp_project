Lucent Technologies Inc. Defendant-Appellee
No._2007-1215
| May_21,_2008
Synopsis
Background : Assignee brought action against competitor alleging infringement of patent that claimed technique to achieve gradual_ramping up of power_signal in code division multiple access ( CDMA ) mobile_communication_system
The United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Texas Leonard Davis J. 2007_WL_294176 granted summary_judgment that patent was invalid as anticipated
Assignee appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Moore Circuit_Judge held that :

fact issue of whether prior_art_reference disclosed `` synchronization prior to transmission '' limitation in patent could not be raised by assignee for first_time on appeal ;

assignee did not raise issue before district_court of whether prior_art_reference disclosed `` synchronization prior to transmission '' limitation in patent ;

client 's selection of new counsel for making appeal did not present exceptional case or circumstance in which declining appellate review of arguments not presented to district_court would result in injustice ;

Court of Appeals could not determine in first instance on appeal what particular prior_art_reference disclosed ; and

assignee 's argument raised for first_time on appeal without any justification as to what prior_art_reference disclosed did not warrant remand to district_court

Opinion
MOORE Circuit_Judge
Plaintiff-Appellant Golden_Bridge Technology Inc. ( Golden_Bridge ) appeals the decision of the United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Texas granting summary_judgment that claims 13_and_23 of U.S. Patent No._6574,267 ( ¡¬267_patent ) which is assigned to Golden_Bridge are anticipated by PCT Publication No
WO9746041 to Hakkinen et al
( Hakkinen ) and a May 1995 version of a Code Division Multiple Access ( CDMA ) standard called `` Mobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual-Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular System '' TIA/EIA/IS-95A ( IS-95A )
We affirm the judgment of the district_court that claims 13_and_23 are anticipated by the Hakkinen_reference
Because we affirm the district_court judgment of invalidity on the basis of the Hakkinen_reference we do not address the invalidation based upon the IS-95A_reference

BACKGROUND
The mobile_communication_system described in the ¡¬267_patent employs a CDMA scheme where multiple mobile phones communicate at the same time with the same base station over the same frequency range by using different numerical `` spreading codes '' in their transmissions.1 If too many mobile phones are transmitting simultaneously at high power levels the mobile phones can interfere with each other
Therefore there is a need to have *1321 each mobile phone transmit only as loudly as necessary to be heard by the base station
The ¡¬267_patent claims a technique to achieve this result the gradual_ramping up of the power_signal in a CDMA system

After Golden_Bridge filed suit against Lucent the district_court held a claim construction hearing and the parties shortly thereafter reached agreement on the construction of certain claim terms at issue in this appeal
Lucent and Nokia filed a motion for summary_judgment that the asserted claims of the ¡¬ 267 patent were anticipated by the IS-95A and Hakkinen_references
The motion was referred to a Magistrate Judge who after conducting a hearing and reviewing extensive briefing recommended a finding of invalidity of the asserted claims of the ¡¬267_patent as being anticipated under 35 U.S.C.¡± 102 ( b ) by each the IS-95A_reference and the Hakkinen_reference
Golden_Bridge objected and filed another brief articulating the reasons that the Hakkinen_reference did not anticipate
Based upon further review and analysis of the evidentiary record the district_court adopted the Magistrate 's Report and Recommendation
The district_court then entered summary_judgment of invalidity from which Golden_Bridge now appeals
