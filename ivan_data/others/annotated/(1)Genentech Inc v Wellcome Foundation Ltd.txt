United States Court of Appeals Federal Circuit
GENENTECH INC. Innovi_N.V. and Leuven_Research & Development_VZW Plaintiffs-Appellees v. The WELLCOME FOUNDATION LIMITED Wellcome Biotechnology Limited Burroughs Wellcome Co. B.W
Manufacturing Inc. and Welgen Manufacturing Inc. Defendants and
Genetics_Institute Inc. and GI_Manufacturing Inc. Defendants-Appellants
Nos._92-1503 92-1505
| June_27,_1994
Synopsis
Action was filed alleging infringement of three patents describing glycoprotein tissue plasminogen activator and its production
Alleged infringers moved for judgment notwithstanding verdict in favor of patentee or in alternative for new_trial
The United_States_District_Court for the District of Delaware Joseph J. Farnan Jr. J. denied motions and appeal was taken
The Court of Appeals Plager Circuit_Judge held that : ( 1 ) specific_activity_limitation appearing in claims for one patent meant specific_activity as measured by using bovine fibrin plate assay ; ( 2 ) considering prosecution history specific_activity of alleged infringing product did not as matter of law meet specific_activity_limitation appearing in claim under doctrine of equivalents ; and ( 3 ) human_tissue_plasminogen_activator limitation appearing in two of the patents meant natural_protein found only in patented product and jury 's implied conclusion that alleged infringing product met activator limitation appearing in patents under doctrine of equivalents was not supported by substantial evidence

Opinion
PLAGER Circuit_Judge
The question in this patent infringement action is whether a protein formed through recombinant_DNA_technology infringes under the doctrine of equivalents any of three patents : a patent directed to a natural_protein extracted from certain human cancer cells ; a patent directed to the materials needed to produce the natural_protein through recombinant_DNA_technology i.e. the DNA_sequence encoding the protein the expression_vector containing the sequence and the microorganism or cell_culture capable of expressing the protein ; or a patent directed to the process of producing the natural_protein through recombinant_DNA_technology
The United_States_District_Court for the District of Delaware found in favor of the patent owners/licensees ( and their agent ) plaintiffs Genentech Inc. ( Genentech ) Innovi_N.V. ( Innovi ) and Leuven_Research & Development_VZW ( Leuven ) holding that the Genetics_defendants to wit Genetics_Institute Inc. ( Institute ) and Genetics Manufacturing Inc. ( GI_Manufacturing ) infringed under the doctrine of equivalents U.S. Patent Nos._4752,603 ( the '603_patent ) 4,766,075 ( the '075_patent ) and 4,853,330 ( the '330_patent )
That judgment was entered by the court on April_6,_1990 in consolidated Civil Action Nos._88-330 and 89-407 following a jury trial and became final on July_15,_1992 when the court denied defendants ' motions for judgment as a matter of law ( JMOL ) 1 or in the alternative a new_trial
Genentech Inc. v. Wellcome Foundation Ltd. 798_F.Supp._213 24_USPQ2d_1782_(D.Del.1992)
The Genetics_defendants appeal
We find that the judgment of the trial court is not sustainable under the law and reverse

BACKGROUND
1
The protein tissue plasminogen activator ( t-PA ) plays an important role in the dissolution of fibrin clots in the human body
The body forms such clots typically to breach a rupture in a blood vessel
When they are no longer needed they are dissolved through the action of plasmin an enzyme which binds to the fibrin and severs the bonds between the fibrin molecules
Since plasmin circulates through the blood in an inactive form called plasminogen a mechanism must be provided to activate the plasminogen and convert it to plasmin when a clot is targeted for dissolution by the body
The protein t-PA serves as that mechanism

Unfortunately a pathological clot known as a 'thrombus ' sometimes forms in intact vessels and causes life-threatening conditions
When a thrombus occurs the normal amount of t-PA circulating in the body may not be effective to produce plasmin fast enough to dissolve the clot and avoid the risk of heart muscle damage or death
An additional dosage of a material which activates the plasminogen is often necessary to dissolve the clot rapidly
Several materials such as natural_t-PA extracted from human cells streptokinase or urokinase were known to perform *1558 this function although imperfectly either because in the case of streptokinase and urokinase of undesirable side effects and low affinity to fibrin and in the case of natural_t-PA the inability to derive clinically effective volumes from known sources

Plaintiff Leuven then set to work to find a way to produce natural_t-PA in a commercially useful way i.e. in sufficient quantities and at a sufficient level of purity and effectiveness to meet commercial demands
This task was assigned to three of Leuven 's scientists-Drs
Collen Rijken and Matsuo
They discovered that a commercially useful quantity and purity of natural_t-PA could be produced from human melanoma cell_cultures

This discovery is the subject of the '603_patent the sole independent claim of which reads : 1
Human plasminogen activator having thrombolytic properties immunologically distinct from urokinase and having a specific_activity of about 500,000 IU/mg
using the WHO First_International_Reference_Preparation of t-PA ( tissue plasminogen activator ) as assay_standard or a specific_activity of about 90,000 IU/mg
using the WHO First_International_Reference_Preparation of urokinase as assay_standard

Meanwhile plaintiff Genentech set about pursuing the same objective a commercially useful process for producing natural_t-PA but by a different route-recombinant_DNA_technology.2 That task was assigned to four Genentech scientists-Drs
Goeddel Kohr Vehar and Pennica
They ultimately discovered such a process as well as the intermediate_products used in the process i.e. the DNA_sequence encoding human_t-PA the expression_vector containing that sequence and the microorganism or cell_culture capable of expressing human_t-PA using that vector

The intermediate_products are the subject of the claims of the '075_patent of which claims 1 3 and 8 are representative : 1
A DNA isolate consisting essentially of a DNA_sequence encoding human_tissue_plasminogen_activator

* * * * * * 3
A recombinant expression_vector containing a DNA_sequence encoding human_tissue_plasminogen_activator wherein the vector is capable of expressing human_tissue_plasminogen_activator in a transformed_microorganism or cell_culture

* * * * * * 8
A cell_culture capable of expressing human_tissue_plasminogen_activator obtained by transforming a mammalian cell line with a vector according to claim 3

The process itself is the subject of the claims of the '330_patent of which claims 1 8 and 12 are representative : 1
A process which comprises expressing a DNA_sequence encoding human_tissue_plasminogen_activator in a recombinant_host_cell said recombinant_host_cell being a microorganism or cell_culture transformed with an expression_vector containing said DNA_sequence

* * * * * * 8
A process for producing recombinant_human_tissue_plasminogen_activator_comprising : ( a ) growing recombinant cells in a growth medium said cells being a microorganism or cell_culture transformed with an expression_vector containing DNA encoding human_tissue_plasminogen_activator ; and
( b ) simultaneously expressing said DNA thereby producing recombinant human_tissue_plasminogen_activator

* * * * * * 12
A process for producing recombinant_human_tissue_plasminogen_activator_comprising : ( a ) transforming a microorganism or cell_culture with a replicable vector containing DNA encoding human_tissue_plasminogen_activator ; and
*1559 ( b ) expressing said DNA in said transformed_microorganism or cell_culture
