Opinion
CLEVENGER Circuit_Judge
Atlantic Paste & Glue Company Inc. ( Atlantic ) appeals the judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of New_York holding that J.T
Eaton & Company Inc. 's ( Eaton ) patent for a mousetrap is not invalid and is infringed by Atlantic 's accused mousetraps

For the reasons set forth below we conclude that the district_court misinterpreted claim 1 of Eaton 's patent
Consequently we reverse the judgment that the patent is infringed and we vacate the judgment that the patent is not invalid under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103 ( 1994 )
The case is remanded to the district_court for further proceedings with regard to the validity issue

I
This suit involves United States Patent No._4438,584 ( the '584_patent ) issued on March_27,_1984 to Stanley Z. Baker and Benjamin H. Baker
The patent assigned to Eaton discloses a `` Trap for Rats Mice and Other Vermin ''
Claim 1 the patent 's only independent claim reads with emphasis added : A commercial trap product for catching mice or rats comprised of a generally flat support formed of a non-porous thin sheet material said support having at least one positioning surface at least one indented portion having a given depth below said positioning surface and a relatively thick layer of pressure_sensitive_adhesive_material contained within said indented portion having a thickness of at least 1/16 inch a plastic_flow_temperature above 120¢X > F. and an upper surface ; said indented portion having a greater depth than the thickness of said layer of adhesive and said positioning surface being spaced above said adhesive layer upper surface

Claim 1 thus recites a dishlike container holding a pressure_sensitive_adhesive_material in which vermin become stuck and thereby trapped
The commercial embodiments of the invention feature two plastic containers or traps typically packaged together one *1565 on top of the other face-to-face capable of being hung in a vertical position at the point of sale

After a bench_trial the district_court issued findings of fact and conclusions of law in which it interpreted the limitation `` a plastic_flow_temperature above 120¢XF ''
Based on its interpretation Atlantic 's accused product was found to infringe claim 1
Additionally the district_court held claim 1 not invalid under ¡± 103 for obviousness or under 35 U.S.C.¡± 102 ( b ) ( 1994 ) for having been on sale for more than one year before the filing date of the '584_patent
For the reasons set forth in the opinion of the district_court we hold that on the facts presented in this case claim 1 is not invalid under ¡± 102 ( b ) and we thus refer no further to that issue

Whether claim 1 is infringed by Atlantic 's accused product and whether Eaton 's commercially successful product is an embodiment of the invention claimed ( the latter being germane in this case to the validity of the patent under ¡± 103 ) depend on what is meant by `` a plastic_flow_temperature above 120¢XF ''
As we will explain below the correct meaning of that term is established by reading the prosecution history of the '584_patent
That is a legal exercise which we are obligated to conduct independently
