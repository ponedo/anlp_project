Synopsis
Holder of patent for handbells brought action against competitor alleging infringement under doctrine of equivalents
The United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Pennsylvania Edmund V. Ludwig J. granted judgment n.o.v
for the defendant and appeal was taken
The Court of Appeals Rich Circuit_Judge held that patent holder failed to establish infringement under doctrine of equivalents absent testimony sufficiently explaining both why overall function way and result of accused device was substantially same as those of claimed device and why accused device 's plastic/slotted plastic/felt arrangement was equivalent of claimed buttons limitation

Opinion
RICH Circuit_Judge
Jacob H. Malta and Malmark Inc. ( Malmark ) ( collectively Malta ) appeal in this patent case from the November 20 1989 Order of the United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Pennsylvania granting judgment notwithstanding a jury verdict ( JNOV ) of non-infringement in favor of defendant Schulmerich Carillons Inc. ( Schulmerich )
Malta v. Schulmerich Carillons Inc. 13_USPQ2d_1900_(E.D.Pa.1989)
Schulmerich cross-appealed from the November 20 Order insofar as it denied Schulmerich 's motion for JNOV that it is the equitable owner of the patent in suit and/or has a shop right under that patent
We affirm on the ground of non-infringement and do not reach the cross-appeal

BACKGROUND
A
The Patent in Suit
The patent in suit U.S. Patent No._3941,082 ( '082_patent ) issued to Mr. Jacob Malta is directed to improvements in the design of handbells of the type used by music groups in churches schools and the like
Quoting the patent `` [ a ] chorus of players using a plurality of tuned bells may render any given tune which falls within the range of notes offered by the specific bells ''

Handbells are generally made up of the bell itself a handle attached to the closed_end of the bell and a clapper_assembly pivotably mounted inside the bell and moving in a single plane
Attached to one end of the clapper_assembly is a generally circular clapper or striker which when the handbell is swung strikes the bell to ring it

The '082_patent discloses a number of improvements in handbell design
Most relevant to this suit is Malta 's provision of a clapper mechanism for allowing the loudness of the bell to be quickly adjusted `` on the fly '' i.e. while the bell is being played
Specifically it was known in the prior art *1322 to provide the peripheral surface of the clapper with portions of differing hardness so that by rotating the clapper one could change which portion of it struck the bell and consequently the loudness of the bell
However the clapper could not be adjusted while the bell was being played
The '082_patent not only provided the clapper with striking surfaces of differing hardness around the periphery thereof but also provided a detent mechanism which releasably locked the clapper in each desired position
In that way the clapper could be rotated by hand while the handbell was being played

The '082_patent discloses two different embodiments for the clapper
These two embodiments shown in Figs
3_and_7 of the '082_patent are reproduced below

?
?
-- -- - The first embodiment shown in Fig._3 has three opposing pairs of `` striking surfaces ''
The first pair ( 66 ) consists simply of the hard rubber of which the clapper is made
The second pair ( 68 ) of striking surfaces has a slot cut into the rubber material
The third pair ( 70 ) has a piece of soft material such as felt attached to the clapper
These three pairs of striking surfaces provide a loud medium and soft sound respectively

The second embodiment shown in Fig._7 has three `` opposed pairs of buttons '' ( 82 ) attached to the surface of the clapper
Each pair of buttons has a different_degree of hardness so that like the embodiment of Fig._3 either a soft medium or loud sound can be produced depending on which button pair is aligned to strike the bell
( The patent 's term `` opposed pairs '' is somewhat confusing
The pairs are not opposed ; rather each pair has opposed buttons of the same hardness )

Claims 2_and_3 are relevant to this appeal
Claim 3 reads as follows : 3
A handbell comprising in combination : a bell having a generally closed_end ; a clapper_assembly adapted to be removably carried within said bell and centrally of the closed_end thereof said assembly comprising a clapper_shaft having one end pivotally associated centrally of the closed_end of said bell and carrying a clapper_member at its free extremity said clapper_member comprising a generally circular striker_assembly rotatably positioned substantially normal to said clapper_shaft and including a plurality of striking buttons positioned in opposed pairs around the outer periphery thereof and wherein each pair of buttons has a different_degree of hardness ; means on said clapper_assembly coacting with said rotatable striker_assembly for permitting rotation of said striker_assembly relative to said clapper_shaft for selectively positioning desired pairs of buttons in striking relation to said bell ; and detent means cooperating with said rotatable striker for releasably holding said striker_assembly in any preselected position
[ Emphasis ours ]
Claim 2 is very similar to claim 3 and differs primarily in two respects : one instead *1323 of the `` coacting '' means recited in claim 3 claim 2 requires an `` indexing means '' on the handle and the clapper_assembly ; and two instead of the `` buttons '' recited in claim 3 claim 2 requires `` at least three opposed pairs of surface portions wherein each of said pairs has a different_degree of hardness ''
