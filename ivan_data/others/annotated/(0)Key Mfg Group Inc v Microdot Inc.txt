United States Court of Appeals Federal Circuit
KEY MANUFACTURING GROUP INC. Plaintiff-Appellee v. MICRODOT INC. Defendant-Appellant
No._90-1342
| Feb._13,_1991
| Rehearing Denied March_15,_1991
Synopsis
Patent holder sued manufacturer of decorative_caps for wheel_nuts alleging infringement
The United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Michigan 679_F.Supp._648 concluded that nuts literally infringed patent
Manufacturer appealed
The Court of Appeals 854_F.2d_1328 vacated infringement judgment and remanded
On remand the United_States_District_Court Bernard A. Friedman J. determined that wheel_caps infringed patent literally and under doctrine of equivalents
Manufacturer appealed
The Court of Appeals Rader Circuit_Judge held that : ( 1 ) District Court improperly interpreted claim by ignoring limitations added to distinguish structure of patent from prior_art ; ( 2 ) manufacturer 's decorative_caps for wheel_nuts did not infringe on patented caps either literally or under doctrine of equivalents ; and ( 3 ) doctrine of equivalents did not reach accused caps inasmuch as hypothetical claim was obvious in light of three prior_art references

Opinion
RADER Circuit_Judge
The United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Michigan adjudged Microdot Inc. ( Microdot ) liable for infringement of reexamined United States Patent No
B1-4,123,961 ( '961_patent ) owned by Key Manufacturing Group Inc. ( Key )
The district_court held that Microdot 's capped wheel_nuts infringe the '961_patent claims literally and under the doctrine of equivalents
Key_Mfg Group Inc. v. Microdot Inc. 15_USPQ2d_1195_(E.D.Mich.1990)
This court reverses

BACKGROUND
Both Key and Microdot manufacture capped wheel_nuts used to attach a wheel to a car axle
The wheel_nuts have several sides or `` wrench_flats '' to permit a tool to grasp the nut for tightening or loosening
The nut_body has two faces
The nut face in direct contact with the wheel is the `` wheel face ''
The opposite or exterior face is the `` cap_face ''

The '961_patent discloses and claims a decorative_nut and stainless_steel_cap for attachment to the nut_body
The stainless_steel_cap has sides corresponding to the wrench_flats
Welds secure the decorative_cap to the cap_face of the nut_body
Claim 1 of the '961_patent reads as follows : 1
A decorative_nut for holding a wheel on a motor vehicle and exposed to view on the wheel said nut having a central threaded aperture polygonal_sides a first_end adapted to engage a wheel a second_end opposite said first_end and having an end_face extending at right_angles to the axis of the nut and a sheet metal cap for the nut and having a section extending over the polygonal_sides of the nut and an end_section adapted to cover the second_end of the nut said section extending over the polygonal_nut_sides including a plurality of cap_wrench_flats respectively associated with and oppositely facing said polygonal_nut_sides said cap_wrench_flats and said polygonal_nut_sides being disposed between said first and second_ends of said nut said end_section being connected to the section of the cap which covers the polygonal_nut_sides by a section formed fully around the perimeter of the cap and having an extension at right_angles to the axis of the nut so as to be parallel to said end_face such connecting section being in juxtaposed contact throughout a substantial_area with and welded to said end_face the position of welded contact between the connecting section and the end_face resulting in shear_forces being applied to the weld in response to the application of forces on the capped wrench_flats which create moments about the central axis of the nut
( Emphasis added )
The highlighted portion constitutes the disputed `` at right_angles '' and `` substantial_area '' claim language
The invention is illustrated in the '961_patent in part as follows :

*1446. ?
?
?
*1447 Microdot 's nut is similar in many respects to the '961 disclosed nut
It differs however in significant particulars
The '961 claims require `` an extension '' of the decorative_cap `` at right_angles to the axis of the nut so as to be parallel to said end_face ''
The cap_face of Microdot 's nut_body and the cap itself have a fifteen degree outward taper
Key does not dispute this fact
Key asserts however that no technologically significant difference exists between Microdot 's fifteen degree_taper and Key 's zero degree interface

Another difference is the area of contact between the decorative_cap and the nut
The '961 claims require `` contact throughout a substantial_area ''
Microdot argues that its cap is not in contact with the nut over a substantial_area

In 1987 Key sued Microdot for infringement of the '961_patent
After a bench trial the district_court upheld the validity of the '961_patent
The district_court also concluded that the reexamined claims as amended and the original claims were identical within the meaning of 35 U.S.C.¡±¡± 252 307 ( b ) ( 1982 )
Finally the district_court concluded that Microdot 's nuts literally infringed the '961 claims
Key_Mfg Group Inc. v. Microdot Inc. 679_F.Supp._648 4_USPQ2d_1687_(E.D.Mich.1987)
The district_court found literal infringement despite its conclusion that `` [ t ] he Microdot capped wheel_nuts differ [ ] from those of Key ''
Id.at 660 4 USPQ2d at 1697

On appeal from that judgment this court affirmed the validity holding but vacated the infringement judgment
The district_court had ignored some claim_limitations
This court stated that `` [ a ] ll claim_limitations are significant and must be considered '' in an infringement analysis
Under the doctrine of equivalents as well `` claim_limitations can not be ignored and 'the plaintiff must show the presence of every element or its substantial equivalent in the accused device '
`` Key_Mfg Group Inc. v. Microdot Inc. 854_F.2d_1328 ( Fed.Cir.1988 ) ( table ) ( opinion available on Westlaw ) ( citing Lemelson v. United States 752_F.2d_1538 1551 224_USPQ_526 533 ( Fed.Cir.1985 ) )
This court remanded for the district_court to `` provide sufficient factual findings on infringement to enable a meaningful review of the merits of its judgment ''
Id

On remand the district_court addressed the claim_limitations of `` substantial_area '' and `` at right_angles to the axis of the nut ''
Key_Mfg Group Inc. v. Microdot Inc. 15_USPQ2d_1195_(E.D.Mich.1990)
The district_court determined that the `` substantial_area '' limitation is met by a weld `` sufficient to hold the cap and nut together in response to shear_forces applied during the loosening or tightening of the wheel nut ''
Id.at 1199
The `` right_angles '' limitation is met if `` at least a portion of the weld '' is at right_angles to the axis of the nut
Id.at 1200

The trial_court thus concluded that Microdot 's wheel_caps infringed the '961 claims literally and under the doctrine of equivalents
With respect to `` substantial_area '' the trial_court opined that Microdot 's wheel_caps use welds with enough strength to resist shearing
Id.at 1201
Further the district_court found that at least a portion of the weld was at right_angles to the axis of the nut
Thus according to the trial_court Microdot literally infringed the '961 claims
Id.at 1202

The district_court concluded that the Microdot nuts also infringe under the doctrine of equivalents
The court opined that the `` substantial_area '' language describes the function of holding the nut and cap together
Thus the trial_court decided that any contact area is equivalent `` as long as the weld is placed in shear during the application of wrenching forces and retains the cap and nut together as the patent teaches ''
Id.at 1203
The district_court determined that Key added the `` at right_angles '' language during prosecution merely to `` clarify the location of the weld on the nut_body and in contrast to the wrench_flats '' rather than to distinguish prior_art
Id
Thus even though Microdot 's nut included *1448 a taper the district_court granted Key `` a range of equivalents which includes a fifteen degree_taper.. '' Id.at 1204
