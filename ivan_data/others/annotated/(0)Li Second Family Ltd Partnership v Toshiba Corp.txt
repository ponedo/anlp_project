Before PLAGER CLEVENGER and SCHALL Circuit_Judges
Opinion
PLAGER Circuit_Judge
The Li Second Family Limited Partnership ( Li ) 1 filed a patent infringement suit in the United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Virginia against Toshiba Corporation and Toshiba_America_Electronic_Components Inc. ( collectively Toshiba )
Li alleged that Toshiba makes semiconductor_devices using a process that infringes several_claims of Li 's U.S._Patent_No._4946,800 ( the '800_patent )
Among its defenses Toshiba alleged that the '800_patent is unenforceable because Li and his attorney engaged in inequitable_conduct before the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( PTO )
After a bench trial on the issue the district_court agreed with Toshiba and concluded that the '800_patent is unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct
Li Second Family Ltd. P'ship v. Toshiba Corp. No._97-306- A ( E.D.Va
May_19,_1999 ) ( memorandum opinion and order )
Because the district_court did not abuse its discretion in holding the '800_patent unenforceable we affirm

BACKGROUND
1
Li owns several patents including the '800_patent and a related patent U.S._Patent_No._4916,513 ( the '513_patent ) in the area of semiconductor technology
Toshiba 's inequitable_conduct claim arises from Li 's alleged failure to disclose to the examiner of the application that resulted in the '800_patent events that occurred during prosecution of the application that resulted in the '513_patent

The '800_patent issued in 1990 from application Serial No._05 /386,102 ( the '102 application ) which was filed in 1973 as a continuation-in-part ( CIP ) of a now-abandoned 1971 application Serial No._05 /154,300 ( the '300 application )
The '513_patent issued in 1990 from application Serial No._05 /838,758 ( the '758 application ) which was filed in 1977 also as a CIP of the '300 application
The '102 and '758 applications were assigned to different examiners at the PTO-the '102 application to Examiner_Saba and the '758 application to Examiner Larkins
The '300 application itself was a CIP of a 1968 application that issued in 1971 as U.S._Patent_No._3585,714 ( the '714_patent ) which in turn was a CIP of a 1965 *1376 application that issued in 1969 as U.S._Patent_No._3430,109 ( the '109_patent )

The '800_patent is directed to a method for making a semiconductor_device with isolation grooves used to separate regions of the device
More specifically the '800_patent claims a method for making a semiconductor_device by forming a semiconductor material substrate of one conductivity type ( e.g. P-type ) ; forming on the substrate a semiconductor material body of the opposite conductivity type ( e.g. N-type ) thus creating a PN_junction ; and forming an isolation groove in the body extending at least to the PN_junction
All claims of the '800_patent include two important limitations : the bottom of the groove must be within 0.1 microns of the PN_junction ( the `` 0.1 micron '' limitation ) and the PN_junction must meet the groove at a curved portion of the groove ( the `` rounding '' limitation )

The '513_patent covers subject matter similar to that of the '800_patent but its claims are directed to semiconductor structure rather than a method for making semiconductors
In the '758 application that resulted in the '513_patent all originally filed claims except claim 16 contained a limitation that the bottom of the groove must be within 1.0 micron of the PN_junction ( the `` 1.0 micron '' limitation )
Claim 16 contained the 0.1 micron limitation found in the claims of the '800_patent
Also claim 8 as filed contained a limitation similar to the rounding limitation found in the claims of the '800_patent

Prosecution of the '102 application which resulted in the '800_patent continued from its filing date in 1973 until February 10 1977 when Examiner_Saba suspended action on the application pending the outcome of an interference proceeding involving the '300 application
Prosecution of the '102 application did not resume until 1984
Meanwhile prosecution of the '758 application proceeded without suspension
