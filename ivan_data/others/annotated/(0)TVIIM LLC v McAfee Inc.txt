Opinion
Reyna Circuit_Judge
TVIIM LLC ( `` TVIIM '' ) sued McAfee Inc. ( `` McAfee '' ) in the United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of California for infringement of U.S. Patent No._6889,168 ( `` '168_patent `` )
A jury determined that McAfee did not infringe the '168_patent and that the '168_patent was invalid
After the jury_verdict TVIIM filed motions for judgment as a matter of law ( `` JMOL '' ) and for a new_trial
The district_court denied both motions and TVIIM filed this appeal challenging the jury_verdict and the district_court 's denial of its post-verdict motions
We affirm because substantial_evidence supports the jury 's findings of non-infringement and invalidity under a uniform construction of the relevant claim terms and the district_court did not abuse its discretion in denying a new_trial

BACKGROUND
1
The '168_Patent
The '168_patent is entitled `` Method and Apparatus for Assessing the Security of a Computer ''
It describes `` a security_system which identifies security_vulnerabilities and discrepancies for a computing_system ''
'168_patent col._1,_ll._65-67
The '168_patent both identifies potential security threats to a computer and under certain conditions recommends action to a user to stop the threat

*1360 Four claims of the '168_patent are relevant to this appeal
Independent claim 1 recites : A security_system for a computer_apparatus wherein said computer_apparatus includes a processor and system_memory said security_system comprising : at least one security module which under direction from the processor accesses and analyzes selected portions of the computer_apparatus to identify vulnerabilities ; at least one utility module which under the direction from the processor performs various_utility_functions with regards to the computer_apparatus in response to the identified vulnerabilities ; and
a security_system_memory which contains security information for performing the analysis of the computer_apparatus
'168_patent col._10,_l._65 to col._11,_l._10 ( disputed terms emphasized )

Dependent_claim 7 recites : The security_system of claim 1 wherein the security modules include at least one of.. an integrity checking module which analyzes files in the system_memory to identify system vulnerabilities ; a network checking module which analyzes the computer_apparatus to identify vulnerabilities created as a result of the computer_apparatus connecting with a data network ; and
a password checking module which analyzes passwords for users of the computer_apparatus to identify vulnerabilities
Id
col._11,_ll._25-46 ( disputed term emphasized )

Dependent_claim 9 recites : `` The security_system of claim 7 wherein the system_memory comprises a list of known vulnerabilities which may be employed by the integrity checking module ''
Id
col._11,_ll._62-64

Finally independent claim 11 recites : A method of providing a security_assessment for a computer_system which includes a system_memory comprising the steps of : providing a security_subsystem in the computer_system such that functionality of the security_subsystem is directed through a processor for the computer_system wherein the security performs steps comprising : identifying a configuration of the system ; accessing the system_memory and performing at least one procedure to provide a security_assessment for at least one aspect of the computer_system ; as a result of any vulnerabilities discovered in the assessment identifying corrective_measures to be taken with regards to the computer_system ; reporting the discovered vulnerability and the identified corrective_measures ; and
upon receiving an appropriate command initiating the corrective_measures
