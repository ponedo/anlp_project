PROST Circuit_Judge
Abbott Laboratories ( `` Abbott '' ) brought suit against Teva_Pharmaceuticals_USA Inc. ( `` Teva '' ) alleging infringement of its patents relating to extended_release_formulations of clarithromycin
Abbott moved for a preliminary_injunction against Teva on the grounds that Teva was infringing claims 2 4 and 6 of U.S._Patent_No._6010,718 ( `` '718_patent `` ) and claim 2 of U.S._Patent_No._6551,616 ( `` '616_patent `` )
Teva resisted the motion primarily by arguing that substantial_questions existed as to the validity of Abbott 's asserted claims under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103
The district_court agreed that Teva had raised a substantial_question as to the validity of claim 2 of the '616_patent but it rejected Teva 's invalidity_arguments as to the asserted claims of the '718_patent
Accordingly the district_court granted Abbott 's motion for a preliminary_injunction
Teva appealed
We have jurisdiction to review the district_court 's order under 28 U.S.C.¡± 1292 ( c ) ( 1 )

On appeal Teva has raised substantial issues as to the validity of each of the asserted claims relied upon for the preliminary_injunction
We vacate the preliminary_injunction

I. Clarithromycin is a broad spectrum antibiotic from the macrolide family of antibiotics all of which are derived from erythromycin A. Taisho Pharmaceuticals Ltd. received U.S. Patent No._4331,803 ( `` '803_patent `` ) for clarithromycin in 1982
In 1991 Abbott the exclusive licensee of the '803_patent introduced Biaxin an immediate release dosage form of clarithromycin
The '803_patent expired on May_23,_2005

*BIG_TOKEN__1333_In_1997__BIG_TOKEN Abbott filed for a patent claiming an extended release formulation of clarithromycin
The patent describes and claims extended release ( `` ER '' ) formulations comprising erythromycin derivatives combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable polymer
The resulting drug-polymer matrix leads to the extended release properties of the formulation
The ER formulation enabled patients to take one pill per day rather than twice as had been required with the immediate release ( `` IR '' ) formulation
That patent issued on January 4 2000 as the '718_patent
Further based on the '718_patent application Abbott filed a continuation-in-part application that claims a method of reducing adverse gastrointestinal ( `` GI '' ) side effects of erythromycin-derived drug formulations by using extended_release_formulations
This continuation-in-part issued as the '616_patent
In 2000 Abbott introduced its ER clarithromycin formulation Biaxin_XL
As of May 2005 Abbott estimated that as between Biaxin and Biaxin_XL Biaxin_XL accounted for 70 % of sales in the Biaxin market
As the original patent on clarithromycin expired on May_23,_2005 generic competitors entered the market for immediate release clarithromycin on May_24,_2005

In December 2002 Teva filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application ( `` ANDA '' ) seeking approval to market an extended release form of clarithromycin similar to Abbott 's ER clarithromycin drug Biaxin_XL
On March_14,_2005 Abbott sued Teva for infringement of the '718 and '616_patent s.1 On May_18,_2005 Abbott moved for a preliminary_injunction against Teva

On May 26 and June_1,_2005 the district_court held oral argument on Abbott 's motion for the preliminary_injunction and thereafter on June 3 issued its memorandum opinion
It listed the four factor test for the grant of a preliminary_injunction namely that the party seeking the preliminary_injunction must show
( 1 ) the movant has some likelihood of success on the merits of the underlying litigation ; ( 2 ) immediate irreparable_harm will result if the relief is not granted ; ( 3 ) the balance of hardships to the parties weighs in the movant 's favor ; and ( 4 ) the public_interest is best served by granting the injunctive relief

v. Andrx Pharms. Inc. No._05-1433 slip op.at 3 ( N.D. Ill. June_3,_2005 ) ( citing Polymer Techs. Inc. v. Bridwell 103_F.3d_970 973 ( Fed.Cir.1996 ) )
The district_court began its analysis and evaluated Abbott 's likelihood of success on the merits by considering Abbott 's infringement contentions and Teva 's invalidity defenses
Teva did not dispute that its generic ER formulation of clarithromycin infringed Abbott 's '718 and '616_patent claims
Rather Teva alleged that the asserted patent claims were invalid for obviousness under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103
The court focused on Teva 's invalidity_arguments and concluded that Teva had raised a substantial_question as to the validity of claim 2 of the '616_patent but it `` ha [ d ] not established that claims 2 4 and 6 of the '718_patent are invalid for obviousness ''
Abbott_Labs. slip op.at 32
Thus as to the asserted claims of the '718_patent Abbott had established a likelihood of success on the merits
As to irreparable_harm the *1334 district_court first noted that because of its finding that Abbott had proved a likelihood of success on the merits of infringement for the '718_patent claims there was a presumption of irreparable_harm that Teva had to rebut
Furthermore Abbott contended that it will face `` irreversible market share losses [ if ].. it loses its preferred position on pharmacy and insurance formularies ''
Abbott_Labs. slip op.at 25
As a result the district_court concluded that `` entry of the generic extended release formulation competitor will likely crush the market '' and therefore absent the preliminary_injunction Abbott would suffer irreparable_harm
Abbott_Labs. slip op.at 27
As to the third factor the district_court stated that Teva was `` reluctan [ t ] or inab [ le ] to quantify the hardship if any it will face if an injunction is incorrectly entered '' and `` there is little choice but to conclude that the balance of hardships favors [ Abbott ] ''
Abbott_Labs. slip op.at 30-31
Lastly the district_court determined that `` [ t ] o the extent that this court has found that the patents in suit are valid the public_interest is best served by enforcing them ''
Id
Based on these considerations the court issued its order entering the preliminary_injunction with respect to the asserted claims of the '718_patent
