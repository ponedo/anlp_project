Opinion
GAJARSA Circuit_Judge
This is an appeal from a patent infringement action involving a genetic_test for Type I hereditary_hemochromatosis
Billups-Rothenberg Inc. ( `` Billups '' ) sued Associated Regional and University Pathologists Inc. ( `` ARUP '' ) and Bio-Rad_Laboratories Inc. ( `` Bio-Rad '' ) alleging infringement of U.S. Patent Nos._5674,681 ( `` ¡¬681_patent `` ) and 6,355,425 ( `` ¡¬425_patent `` ) ( collectively `` patents-in-suit '' )
The parties filed cross-motions for summary_judgment
The district_court denied Billups 's motion for summary_judgment of infringement and granted ARUP and Bio-Rad 's motion for invalidity
In its order the district_court concluded that ( 1 ) the asserted claims of the ¡¬681_patent were invalid for lack of written description and ( 2 ) the asserted claims of the ¡¬425_patent were invalid as anticipated because U.S. Patent No._6025,130 ( `` ¡¬130_patent `` ) disclosed the claimed genetic_test for a specific mutation implicated in Type I hereditary_hemochromatosis

Because the district_court properly granted summary_judgment on both asserted patents we affirm

BACKGROUND
Deoxyribonucleic acid ( `` DNA '' ) is the chemical name for the genetic material that forms the basis of heredity in humans
DNA is composed of sequences of four nucleotides : adenine thymine guanine and cytosine ( abbreviated A T G and C respectively ) arranged in functional units known as genes
Each gene codes for a sequence of amino acids that make up peptides and proteins
The relationship between a nucleotide sequence and the corresponding amino acid sequence is known as the genetic_code
Mutations that alter a sequence of nucleotides may change the corresponding amino acid sequence which in turn may affect the structure or function of the protein encoded by the gene

DNA is packaged into structures known as chromosomes
In somatic cells humans have one pair of sex chromosomes and twenty-two pairs of autosomal chromosomes which are numbered according to size from the largest to the smallest
One chromosome per pair is inherited from each parent
Each chromosome is composed of two arms known as the short_arm and long arm

The patents-in-suit describe genetic_tests for Type I hereditary_hemochromatosis an iron_disorder characterized by excessive *1033 iron_absorption by the body
Hereditary_hemochromatosis is caused by specific mutations in a gene involved in regulating iron_absorption
The gene in question the High Fe ( `` HFE `` ) gene ( `` Fe '' is the chemical symbol for iron ) is located on the short_arm of chromosome six in humans
The HFE_gene codes for the HFE protein also known as the human hemochromatosis protein
When certain mutations occur in the HFE_gene the resulting mutated HFE protein results in increased iron_absorption from the gut
Hereditary_hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive condition meaning that a person must inherit one mutated form of the HFE_gene from each parent to develop the disease
Not everyone with two mutated HFE_genes becomes clinically ill and in some cases inheriting only one mutated gene in combination with mutations in other genes may lead to some increased iron_absorption
The claims of the patents-in-suit are directed to the detection of one or both of two distinct mutations in the HFE_gene known as C282Y and S65C
The prior art ¡¬130_patent describes three mutations in the HFE_gene : C282Y S65C and H63D

In 1994 Billups filed the application for the ¡¬681_patent entitled `` Methods to Identify Hemochromatosis ''
Dr. Barry E. Rothenberg the founder of Billups was named as the inventor
The ¡¬681_patent explains that Type I hereditary_hemochromatosis ( `` hemochromatosis '' ) is a disease caused by a gene linked to the major histocompatibility complex ( `` MHC '' )
¡¬681_patent col.17 ll.51-54
The genes associated with the MHC code for a variety of products many of which defend the body against pathogens
The ¡¬681_patent identifies human chromosome six as the location of the gene responsible for hemochromatosis
Id
col.17 ll.53-54
The specification of the ¡¬681_patent addresses how to detect a mutation : A mutation in a nucleic acid sequence can be detected by various methods to analyze nucleic acids such as by nucleic acid sequencing polymerase chain reaction or hybridization
Such methods are well known to those in the art ( see for example Sambrook et al supra 1989 ; Hames and Higgins Nucleic Acid Hybridisation : a practical approach ( IRL Press New York 1985 ) both of which are incorporated herein by reference )
Id
col.23 ll.26-33

Although some of the ¡¬681_patent 's claims also cover testing for hemochromatosis by detecting defective proteins in a patient 's blood only claims covering the genetic_test for what is now known as the C282Y_mutation are asserted in this case
Claim 2 which is representative of the asserted claims reads : 2
A method to identify an individual having or predisposed to having hemochromatosis comprising the steps of : a ) providing from the individual a sample containing a gene encoding a nonclassical MHC class I heavy_chain
and
b ) detecting a mutation in said gene which mutation results in the reduced ability of said heavy_chain to associate with said £]2 microglobulin wherein the presence of said mutation identifies said individual as having or predisposed to having hemochromatosis
Id
col.31 ll.19-24

Although Billups claimed methods of detecting mutations responsible for hemochromatosis in the ¡¬681_patent it had not yet identified any disease-causing mutations
In August of 1995 Dr._Rothenberg employed Dr. Ritsuko Sawada-Hirai to help him identify the mutations responsible for hemochromatosis
They were unable *1034 to isolate the hemochromatosis_gene or any mutations of the gene

Others however had more success
In 1996 Dr. John N. Feder and a group of scientists unaffiliated with Billups isolated and sequenced the hemochromatosis_gene and published their results
John N. Feder et
al. A Novel MHC Class I-like Gene is Mutated in Patients with Hereditary Haemochromatosis 13 ( 4 ) Nature Genetics 399 ( 1996 )
This group of researchers specifically noted that `` further refinement of the location of this gene has been difficult ''
Id.at 399
This research resulted in numerous U.S. and foreign patents including the ¡¬130_patent entitled `` Hereditary Hemochromatosis Gene ''
The ¡¬130_patent discloses the exact genetic_sequences for the three mutations at issue in this case : C282Y H63D and S65C
See e.g. fig.4A ( genetic_code for the H63D and S65C_mutations identified as 24dBIG_TOKEN__2_and_24__BIG_TOKEN d7 respectively ) ; fig.4C ( genetic_code for the C282Y_mutation identified as 24d1 )

?
Also the ¡¬130_patent describes genetic_tests for hemochromatosis utilizing the mutations and sequence variants identified within the patent
Id
col.23 ll.10-67
Bio-Rad is the assignee of the ¡¬130_patent and licenses it to ARUP a laboratory at the University of Utah that provides genetic_testing services

Dr._Feder and his team published their discovery while ARUP was continuing to search for the hemochromatosis_gene and its mutations
In October 1998 a medical director at ARUP published a paper describing how the genetic probes for the H63D mutation also accidentally identified the nucleotide sequence A193T which corresponds to the S65C_mutation
ARUP developed this assay into the genetic_test presently accused of infringing the patents-in-suit
The assay detected the C282Y H63D and S65C_mutations in samples from patients

At the same time the Billups researchers also used the genetic_sequences discovered by Dr._Feder and his team to refine their own experiments
On March_26,_1999 Dr._Rothenberg Dr. Sawada-Hirai and collaborator Dr. James Barton filed the application that matured into the ¡¬425_patent
The ¡¬425_patent claims a method for diagnosing an iron_disorder by testing for genetic mutations including S65C

Claim 1 of the ¡¬425_patent appears below : *1035 1
A method of diagnosing an iron_disorder or a genetic_susceptibility to developing said disorder in a mammal comprising determining the presence of a mutation in exon 2 of an HFE nucleic acid in a biological sample from said mammal wherein said mutation is not a C¡÷G substitution at nucleotide 187 of SEQ ID NO : 1 and wherein the presence of said mutation is indicative of said disorder or a genetic_susceptibility to developing said disorder
¡¬425_patent col.59 ll.19-26

Table 1 of the ¡¬425_patent labels a genetic_sequence identical to the genetic_sequence in Figure 4A of the ¡¬130_patent as `` S65C ''
Cf
¡¬425_patent col.1-BIG_TOKEN__2_Table_1_ ( `` gagagtcgcc '' ) __BIG_TOKEN ; ¡¬130_patent fig.4A ( `` gagagtcgcc '' )
Additionally the ¡¬425_patent explains that two of the twenty hemochromatosis patients had the S65C_mutation
¡¬425_patent col.31 ll.20-BIG_TOKEN__37_table_6__BIG_TOKEN col.32 l.8 ( `` Probands 3_and_4 had a S65C_mutation '' )
The inventors of the ¡¬425_patent concluded that the S65C_mutation could be used to diagnose hemochromatosis
Id
col.32 ll.8-13

In 2009 Billups sued ARUP and Bio-Rad for infringement of the patents-in-suit
Billups amended its complaint and alleged that ARUP and Bio-Rad infringe the patents-in-suit by `` providing and/or using diagnostic assays or kits for detecting hemochromatosis '' associated with one or both of the C282Y and S65C_mutations

After completion of discovery a Markman hearing and claim construction by the court the parties filed cross-motions for summary_judgment
The district_court granted summary_judgment of invalidity for lack of a written description to ARUP and Bio-Rad
The district_court found it undisputed that : `` The DNA sequence of the hemochromatosis_gene and/or sequence of the C282Y_mutation were not expressly specified in the ¡¬ 681 patent ''
Summ
J
Order 3
Further the district_court noted that it is `` undisputed by the parties that no species of the genus of DNA mutations the presence of which would identify an individual as having or being predisposed to having hemochromatosis were disclosed in the ¡¬681_patent specification ''
Id.at 6
The district_court further stated that `` [ d ] escribing the structure of the resulting protein is not the same as describing the structure of the DNA and its mutations
The invention claimed in the ¡¬681_patent is a method to test for a DNA mutation not a test for a defective protein ''
Id
Additionally the district_court explained that the `` patentee has merely directed the person of ordinary skill in the art to a general location of a mutation on a chromosome and suggested that the mutation may be found in that vicinity ''
Id.at 8
The district_court held the asserted claims of the ¡¬681_patent invalid for lack of written description
The district_court concluded that ARUP and Bio-Rad 's enablement arguments were `` persuasive '' but declined to rule on them in light of its ruling that the claims failed the written description_requirement
Id.at 9

The district_court also granted summary_judgment of invalidity of the ¡¬ 425 patent
First it held that Bio-Rad 's ¡¬130_patent was prior art under 35 U.S.C.¡± 102 ( e ) because it was filed on May_23,_1996 which is before the March 1999 filing date of the ¡¬425_patent
Id.at 3-4 10
Then the district_court determined that the asserted claims of the ¡¬425_patent are anticipated because they claim `` the same genetic_test for S65C as is disclosed in the ¡¬130_patent ''
Id.at 10
The district_court entered final judgment in favor of ARUP and Bio-Rad dismissing the case
This court has jurisdiction over Billups 's timely filed appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )

*1036 DISCUSSION
This court reviews an order of summary_judgment de novo
See e.g. Amgen Inc. v. Hoechst Marion Roussel Inc. 314_F.3d_1313 1339 ( Fed.Cir.2003 )
Summary judgment must be granted when drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-movant there is no genuine issue as to any material fact
Anderson v. Liberty Lobby Inc. 477_U.S._242 248 106_S.Ct._2505 91_L.Ed.2d_202_(1986) ; Fed.R.Civ.P
56 ( c )
We first examine whether the asserted claims of the ¡¬681_patent are invalid for lack of written description
Then we determine whether the asserted claims of the ¡¬425_patent are invalid as anticipated
