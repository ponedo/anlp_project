patentee was likely to succeed in its defense against competitor 's obviousness challenge to patent ;

patentee was likely to succeed in its defense against competitor 's challenge to enforceability of patent ;

patentee 's entry of settlement_agreement with competitor did not contract away patentee 's right to prove irreparable harm ;

balance of hardships tipped in patentee 's favor ;

public interest supported injunction ;

Opinion
LOURIE Circuit_Judge Apotex Inc. and Apotex_Corp. ( collectively referred to as `` Apotex '' ) appeal from the decision of the United_States_District_Court for the Southern_District of New_York granting a preliminary_injunction in favor of Sanofi-Synthelabo Sanofi-Synthelabo Inc. and Bristol-Myers Squibb ( `` BMS '' ) Sanofi Pharmaceuticals Holding Partnership ( collectively referred to as `` Sanofi '' )
Because we conclude that the district_court did not abuse its discretion in granting the preliminary_injunction we affirm

BACKGROUND
Sanofi markets PlavixTHE_R a platelet_aggregation inhibiting agent used to reduce thrombotic_events such as heart_attacks and strokes
The active_ingredient in PlavixTHE_R is clopidogrel_bisulfate which is covered by Sanofi 's patent U.S. Patent 4,847,265 ( `` the ¡¬265_patent `` ) which will expire on November 17 2011

To understand the issues presented in this appeal it is necessary to have a generalized understanding of stereochemistry
Stereochemistry refers to the three-dimensional spatial arrangement of a molecule 's constituent atoms
Molecules that have the same chemical substituents but different spatial arrangements are referred to as stereoisomers
If they contain an asymmetrical carbon atom they exist as non-superimposable mirror images of each other and are referred to as enantiomers
Enantiomers are optically active because they are capable of rotating plane-polarized light ; enantiomers that rotate polarized light to the right are referred to as dextrorotatory enantiomers or d-enantiomers ; enantiomers rotating polarized light to the left are referred to as levorotatory enantiomers or l-enantiomers.1 A mixture of equal amounts of both types of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or racemate and it exhibits no optical activity
Clopidogrel is the dextrorotatory enantiomer of the free base methyl alpha-5- ( 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro ( 3,2-c ) thienopyridyl ) - ( 2-chlorophenyl ) acetate which the parties refer to as `` MATTPCA ''
The active_ingredient in PlavixTHE_R is the bisulfate salt of the d-enantiomer of MATTPCA which is specifically recited in claim 3 of the ¡¬265_patent

In November 2001 Apotex filed an Abbreviated_New_Drug_Application *1373 ( `` ANDA '' ) pursuant to the Hatch-Waxman Act seeking U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( `` FDA '' ) approval to manufacture and sell a generic_version of clopidogrel_bisulfate
Apotex filed a Paragraph IV certification with its ANDA pursuant to 21 U.S.C.¡± 355 ( j ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ( vii ) ( IV ) asserting that the ¡¬ 265 patent is invalid
In response Sanofi sued Apotex on March_21,_2002 claiming that the filing of the ANDA infringed the ¡¬265_patent
Apotex counterclaimed asserting that the patent is invalid and unenforceable
A thirty-month stay of FDA approval for the ANDA was triggered when the suit was filed in the district_court pursuant to 21 U.S.C.¡± 355 ( j ) ( 5 ) ( B ) ( iii )
The stay expired May_17,_2005 and on January 20 2006 the FDA approved the ANDA

Several days before the ANDA was approved Sanofi and Apotex began settlement negotiations in an effort to resolve the litigation
On March_17,_2006 the parties reached a first settlement_agreement that was subject to the approval of the Federal Trade Commission and a consortium of state attorneys general pursuant to an order issued in another litigation involving BMS
In May 2006 the state attorneys general notified the parties that they would not approve the settlement
The parties negotiated a second agreement ( `` the May_agreement '' )
The May_agreement included provisions specifying inter_alia actions that could be taken by the parties in the event that the settlement failed to receive regulatory approval
In July 2006 the state attorneys general again informed the parties that they would not approve the settlement
Apotex then declared `` regulatory_denial '' on July_31,_2006 as permitted under the settlement_agreement which meant inter_alia `` a denial of approval by either the FTC or a state attorney general as to which neither party seeks further review ''
Under the agreement litigation would resume in the event of `` regulatory_denial ''

Pursuant to the aforementioned agreement Apotex launched its generic clopidogrel_bisulfate product on August 8 2006
In accordance with the provisions in the settlement_agreement Sanofi notified Apotex of its intent to move for a preliminary_injunction in the time frame permitted by the agreement viz. five business days after the generic launch.2 Sanofi filed its motion for a preliminary_injunction on August 15 2006 and requested a recall of Apotex 's products that were already distributed
After a two-day evidentiary hearing the district_court granted the motion for injunctive relief on August 31 2006 but denied the request for recall
During the period between the generic launch and the entry of the preliminary_injunction Apotex shipped a six-month supply of its product to distributors in the United States

In reaching its decision the district_court applied the established four-factor test for preliminary injunctive relief and found that the factors weighed in favor of an injunction
Regarding the likelihood of success on the merits the court noted that Apotex conceded that its accused products infringe claim 3 of the ¡¬265_patent
The court then found that Apotex failed to establish a likelihood of proving invalidity at trial-rejecting its anticipation obviousness and obviousness-type double patenting invalidity defenses
The court also determined that Apotex failed to raise a substantial question as to whether the ¡¬ *1374 265 patent is unenforceable due to inequitable conduct
Additionally the court found that the remaining three factors of the test favored issuance of a preliminary_injunction
As for Apotex 's other defenses the court concluded that the doctrine of laches was inapplicable and it rejected Apotex 's unclean hands defense
The court set bond in the amount of $ 400 million
Trial is scheduled to commence on January 22 2007

Apotex moved for a stay of the injunction which we denied on September 21 2006 and it filed its appeal from the district_court 's grant of the preliminary_injunction
An expedited briefing schedule was set and oral argument was heard on October 31 2006
We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1292 ( c ) in view of ¡±¡± 1292 ( a ) and 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
