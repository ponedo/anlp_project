Opinion
*1556 PAULINE NEWMAN Circuit_Judge
The court 's prior_judgment of this appeal and cross-appeal was vacated by the Supreme_Court and remanded `` for further_consideration in light of Markman v. Westview_Instruments Inc. 517_U.S._370 116_S.Ct._1384 134_L.Ed.2d_577_(1996) ''
U.S._Surgical Corp. v. Ethicon Inc. 517_U.S._1164 116_S.Ct._1562 134_L.Ed.2d_662_(1996)
Our prior_judgment affirmed the judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the District of Connecticut,1 entered on jury_verdicts that claim 1 of U.S._Surgical 's United_States_Patent_No._5100,420 ( the '420_patent ) is infringed but invalid for obviousness and that claims 1 2 and 7 of United_States_Patent_No._5084,057 ( the '057_patent ) are not infringed and are invalid for obviousness
The issue of inequitable_conduct during patent prosecution was decided before trial by summary_judgment in favor of U.S._Surgical
Each of U.S._Surgical and Ethicon appealed the rulings adverse to it
After full briefing and oral argument this court entered judgment pursuant to Federal_Circuit Rule 36 :

Rule 36 : Judgment of affirmance without opinion.- The court may enter a judgment of affirmance without opinion citing this rule when it determines that any of the following circumstances exist : ( a ) the judgment decision or order of the trial court appealed from is based on findings that are not clearly erroneous ; ( b ) the evidence in support of a jury_verdict is sufficient ; ( c ) summary_judgment directed verdict or judgment on the pleadings is supported by the record ; ( d ) the decision of an administrative agency warrants affirmance under the standard of review in the statute authorizing the petition for review ; or
( e ) a judgment or decision has been entered without an error of law ; and an opinion would have no precedential_value
Appeals whose judgments are entered under Rule 36 receive the full consideration of the court and are no less carefully decided than the cases in which we issue full opinions
The Rule permits the court to dispense with issuing an opinion that would have no precedential_value when the circumstances of the Rule exist
See Taylor v. McKeithen 407_U.S._191 194_n._4 92_S.Ct._1980 1982_n._4 32_L.Ed.2d_648_(1972) ( `` We of course agree that the courts of appeals should have wide latitude in their decisions of whether or how to write opinions
That is especially true with respect to summary affirmances '' )
Seven weeks after this decision reported at 48_F.3d_1237_(Fed.Cir.1995) ( Table ) for which rehearing and rehearing en banc were denied the Federal_Circuit decided Markman v. Westview_Instruments Inc. 52_F.3d_967 34_USPQ2d_1321_(Fed.Cir.1995) ( en banc )
The Supreme_Court granted certiorari in Markman and also upon U.S._Surgical 's petition
After deciding the Markman appeal reported at 517_U.S._370 116_S.Ct._1384 134_L.Ed.2d_577 38_USPQ2d_1461_(1996) the Court instructed the Federal_Circuit to give further_consideration to U.S._Surgical 's case in light of the Court 's decision in Markman
We have done so

The judgment of the district court is affirmed on the ground of invalidity of the '420 and '057_patent s based on obviousness
We do not reach the issues of infringement and the conditional cross-appeal of the issue of inequitable_conduct
See Consolidated Aluminum Corp. v. Foseco Int ' l Ltd. 910_F.2d_804 814 15_USPQ2d_1481 1489 ( 1990 ) ( `` a party may defend a judgment 'on any ground properly raised below ' `` ) ( citing Washington v. Yakima Indian Nation 439_U.S._463 476_n._20 99_S.Ct._740 749_n._20 58_L.Ed.2d_740_(1979) ) ; Lough v. Brunswick Corp. 86_F.3d_1113 1123 39_USPQ2d_1100 1107 ( Fed.Cir.1996 ) ( `` No further public interest is served by our resolving an infringement question after a determination that the patent is invalid `` )
We now fully explain our decision

*1557 The U.S._Surgical Inventions
The inventions claimed in the '420_patent and its continuation-in-part the '057_patent are for a surgical_instrument for ligating blood_vessels and other_tissues during endoscopic_surgery by applying multiple ligating clips in sequence

Endoscopic_surgery is a procedure whereby instead of opening the abdomen or other body_cavity by incision to provide open access to the surgical_site the surgery is performed by inserting the surgical_instruments into the body through small tubes called trocars
The small size of the incisions that accommodate the trocars results in less tissue damage less pain and faster healing than for traditional open surgery
In performing endoscopic_surgery the body_cavity is inflated with a gas called an insufflating gas to provide working space
For most procedures today a miniature_video_camera is used to televise the surgical_site the enlarged video image appearing upon an external screen and guiding the surgeon or surgical team in manipulating the instruments through the trocars

Endoscopic_surgery was in somewhat limited use for many years having been used mostly for the ligation of fallopian tubes the surgeon viewing the site through an eyepiece
Endoscopic procedures experienced rapid expansion after about 1989 particularly for gallbladder removal
Witnesses disputed at trial whether the expansion was due to the development of the miniature_video_camera or the development of U.S._Surgical 's endoscopic multiple clip_applier

During both endoscopic and open surgery blood_vessels may be closed and tissues clamped using small `` U '' shaped clamps called ligating clips
Ligating clips are applied by an instrument that positions the clip about the tissue or vessel to be secured and then compresses the clip
When initially developed ligating clip instruments were capable of being loaded with only one clip at a time and required reloading between each application
Then U.S._Surgical developed a ligating clip_applier for open surgical use that applied multiple_clips in succession without reloading the instrument
This instrument having the brand name `` Premium_Surgiclip '' is the subject of United_States_Patent_No._5030,226 ( the '226_patent )
The Premium_Surgiclip and the '226_patent are prior art to the '420 and '057_patent s in suit and were the subject of extensive testimony at trial

At trial witnesses explained the subsequent development of the instrument of the patents in suit a ligating clip_applier for endoscopic_use that applies multiple_clips in succession without withdrawing and reloading the instrument
U.S._Surgical 's instrument having the brand name EndoClip was the first multiple clip_applier for endoscopic_use
The instrument is depicted in the '420_patent as follows :

?
*1558 The instrument is depicted in the '057_patent with a different handle as follows :

?
-- -- - It is seen that these instruments have an elongated shank that holds the ligating clips and is shaped for endoscopic_use through a trocar
After insertion into the body_cavity a clip is pushed into position in the jaws using controls on the handle and the clip is applied to the tissue to be ligated by closing the jaws using controls on the handle
The jaws are then opened and the next clip is pushed into position
Thus successive clips may be applied without withdrawing the instrument from within the body

Claim 1 of the '420_patent is directed to the combination of the trocar and the clip_applier each component having defined limitations
Claim 1 is the only '420_patent claim in suit : 1
In combination : a ) a trocar having a cannula and valve_means for sealing said cannula said cannula being adapted for entry into a body_cavity ; b ) an endoscopic clip_applier having : i ) a frame ; ii ) an endoscopic_portion defining a longitudinal axis and extending distally from said frame said endoscopic_portion being insertable into said cannula through said valve_means in sealing engagement therewith said endoscopic_portion further including a plurality of surgical_clips disposed in an array and clip closing means for sequentially closing said surgical_clips ; and
iii ) seal means associated and adapted to cooperate with at least one of said endoscopic_portion and said frame to obstruct passage of gaseous media from the body_cavity
Claim 1 the broadest claim of the '057_patent also describes the endoscopic apparatus as comprising several elements
The claim elements are defined in terms of their function as provided in 35 U.S.C.¡± 112 ?
6 : 1
An apparatus for endoscopic application of surgical_clips to body_tissue which comprises : a ) frame_means ; b ) endoscopic_means connected to said frame_means of generally elongated configuration and extending distally from said frame_means and including : i ) means for storing a plurality of surgical_clips ; ii ) means for individually advancing said clips to the distal_portion of said endoscopic_means for positioning adjacent the body_tissue to be clipped ; iii ) means for at least partially closing said clip at least sufficient to grip the body_tissue after the clip has been advanced distally to said distal_portion of said endoscopic_means ; and
iv ) gaseous_sealing_means
Claim 2 of the '057_patent specifies the use of silicon grease as the gaseous_sealing_means of clause iv and claim 7 is directed to a disposable device as in claim 1

Ethicon 's defense that the claims are invalid for obviousness was based on the ground that U.S._Surgical had merely adapted to endoscopic_use its own prior_art_multiple_clip_applier the Premium_Surgiclip of the '226_patent by known and routine adaptation
*1559 Thus Ethicon presented evidence and argument that U.S._Surgical had simply elongated the body of its prior_art_multiple_clip_applier so that it could be used through a trocar with a sealing means to prevent escape of the insufflating gas through the trocar
Ethicon adduced extensive evidence that such adaptation was well known to persons of ordinary skill in the field of endoscopic instruments
U.S._Surgical countered with evidence and argument to the contrary

The jury held by special verdicts that the claims in suit were invalid for obviousness
On appellate review we determine whether on correct instructions of law there was substantial evidence whereby a reasonable jury could have reached the verdict reached by this jury
See Litton Sys. Inc. v. Honeywell Inc. 87_F.3d_1559 1566 39_USPQ2d_1321 1324 ( Fed.Cir.1996 ) ( `` Substantial_evidence describes that minimum quantum of evidence from which a jury might reasonably afford relief
`` ) ; Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co. 72_F.3d_857 862 37_USPQ2d_1161 1163 ( Fed.Cir.1995 ) ( `` Substantial_evidence is such relevant evidence on the record as a whole as could be accepted by a reasonable mind as adequate to support the verdict '' )
Conflicting evidence and argument must be viewed as resolved favorably to the party in whose favor the jury found
The reviewing court must give appropriate deference to the jury 's choices in weighing the evidence in deciding between opposing positions and in drawing factual inferences
Richardson v. Suzuki Motor Co. 868_F.2d_1226 9_USPQ2d_1913_(Fed.Cir.1989) ( `` 'the appellate court 's function is exhausted when that evidentiary basis [ of the jury 's verdict ] becomes apparent it being immaterial that the court might draw a contrary inference or feel that another conclusion is more reasonable '
