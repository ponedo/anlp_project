Nos._2009-1132 2009-1151
| Aug._20,_2010
Synopsis
Background : Patent holder and its exclusive licensee brought action against competitor alleging infringement of patent directed to improvement of bundle_breakers
After patent was construed 2007_WL_4105832 and ruled not infringed in part 560_F.Supp.2d_893 competitor moved for judgment as matter of law on issue of invalidity for obviousness
The United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of California William H. Alsup J. 634_F.Supp.2d_1024 granted motion
Plaintiffs appealed validity ruling and competitor cross-appealed determination that licensee had standing to sue for lost profit damages

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Rader Chief_Judge held that :

patent was obvious and thus invalid and

secondary considerations of non-obviousness did not create reasonable dispute that patent was obvious

Affirmed

Opinion
RADER Chief_Judge
Following a trial for patent infringement that resulted in a hung jury the United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of California ruled as a matter of law that U.S. Patent No._6655,566 ( the `` ¡¬566_patent `` ) would have been obvious at the time of invention

Because the record supports the trial court 's judgment this court affirms

I
A `` bundle_breaker '' is a machine used to separate stacked sheets of corrugated board
The ¡¬566_patent claims an improvement over the traditional bundle_breaker by providing `` compliance_structures '' which allow a bundle_breaker to simultaneously break multiple stacks of corrugated board ( logs ) of different heights

The assembly line in corrugated board manufacturing plants typically includes a number of machines that prepare stacks of corrugated board or bundles

First a rotary die cutter scores a single sheet of corrugated board creating a series of `` weakened lines '' so that the board can be separated later into individual boxes
Next a stacker collects multiple sheets and stacks them into a `` log ''
The stacker aligns the sheets ' weakened lines so that each log contains a series of `` weakened planes ''
The bundle_breaker then separates a log into individual bundles by `` breaking '' the log along the weakened planes
Finally a load former puts the bundles onto pallets

The ¡¬566_patent filed on August 28 2002 and issued on December 2 2003 shows a bundle_breaker separating a log ( 4 ) into separate bundles ( 2_and_3 ) :

*1297. ?
A typical_bundle_breaker as essentially shown in this Figure 14 has an upstream conveyor belt ( 10 ) and a downstream conveyor belt ( 13 ) separated by a gap
When the weakened plane ( 9 ) of a log straddles the gap or `` breaking line '' the conveyor belts are stopped and independent clamps ( 16_and_17 ) are lowered to hold the log in position
The downstream portion of the bundle_breaker then pivots about an axis ( 103 ) to break off a bundle
Unlike the bundle_breaker shown above a typical_bundle_breaker might transfer the separated bundle off of the downstream conveyor before advancing the remaining portion of the log to continue the breaking process
Bundle breakers of this sort were well known in the art when the application for the ¡¬566_patent was filed
The ¡¬566_patent specification describes one prior art bundle_breaker the Pallmac machine as one that would feed two or more logs through its bundle_breaker side by side in order to speed production
As described in the ¡¬566_patent however this multiple-log approach came with problems
Specifically if one or more of the side-by-side_logs were higher than the others due perhaps to a miscount in the number of sheets the rigid clamps used to hold the logs in position while breaking would exert a different amount of pressure on each log
The ¡¬566_patent describes the result of unequal pressure : [ M ] ore pressure is exerted on the taller logs which can damage compressible material like corrugated cardboard
If the logs are not compressible then insufficient pressure is placed on the shorter logs and shifting of the logs can occur when the bundles are broken off from the log..
In the industry this problem is called a 'lack of compliance ' problem ; i.e. the force on all the side by side_logs is not substantially equal
¡¬566_patent col.2 ll.16-31

The inventors of the ¡¬566_patent Merrill Martin and Daniel Talken came up with an improved clamp structure to solve the lack of compliance problem which they called a `` compliance_structure ''
An example of the inventors ' compliance_structure is shown most clearly in Figure 20 of the patent :
