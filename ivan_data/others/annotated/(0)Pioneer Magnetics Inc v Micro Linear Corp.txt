United States Court of Appeals Federal Circuit
PIONEER MAGNETICS INC. Plaintiff-Appellant v. MICRO LINEAR CORPORATION Defendant-Appellee
No._00-1012
| June_2,_2003
Synopsis
Patentee brought action against competitor alleging infringement of patent directed toward unity_power_factor_power_supply
The United States District Court for the Central District of California Lourdes G. Baird J. granted summary_judgment of noninfringement and patentee appealed
The Court of Appeals Mayer Chief_Judge affirmed 238_F.3d_1341
Patentee appealed
The Supreme_Court vacated and remanded 535_U.S._1108 122_S.Ct._2322 153_L.Ed.2d_151
On remand the Court of Appeals returned case for consideration to original merits panel 42_Fed.Appx._470
On motion for reconsideration the Court of Appeals held that : ( 1 ) presumption arose that prosecution_history_estoppel applied to applicant 's amendment of switching multiplier_circuit_claims_limitations and ( 2 ) patentee failed to overcome presumption that it surrendered non-switching multiplier_circuit equivalent to switching multiplier_circuit_claims_limitations

Judgment of noninfringement affirmed

Opinion
PER CURIAM
After having been decided in light of our en banc decision in Festo_Corp. v. Shoketsu_Kinzoku_Kogyo_Kabushiki_Co. Ltd. 234_F.3d_558 56_USPQ2d_1865_(Fed.Cir.2000) this case returns to us for reconsideration in light of the Supreme_Court 's decision in Festo_Corp. v. Shoketsu_Kinzoku_Kogyo_Kabushiki_Co. Ltd. 535_U.S._722 122_S.Ct._1831 152_L.Ed.2d_944_(2002)
Because there was a narrowing amendment and the equivalent at issue was foreseeable at the time of filing we affirm the district_court 's judgment
Pioneer_Magnetics Inc. v. Micro_Linear Corp. No._95- CV-8307 ( C.D.Cal
Nov._10,_1998 )

Background
Pioneer_Magnetics ( Pioneer ) owns United_States_Patent_No._4677,366 ( the ¡¬ 366 patent ) directed toward a `` unity_power_factor_power_supply ''
The patent describes circuitry designed to receive variant levels of input voltage and to emit a constant output voltage thereby providing a steady electrical current source to another circuit

The ¡¬366_patent consists of four claims : independent claim 1 and dependent claims 2-4
Claim 1 recites in relevant part : `` In a switched power supply : a rectifier adapted to be connected to the alternating current line ; a boost converter connected to the output of said rectifier.. ; and a control_circuit.. said control_circuit including a voltage error amplifier.. a switching analog_multiplier_circuit.. a current regulator amplifier.. and circuit_means including a pulse-width_modulator.. '' ¡¬366_patent col._6,_ll._7-38 ( emphasis added )
Claim 2 also relevant to the prosecution history of the ¡¬366_patent recites : `` The combination defined in claim 1 in which said multiplier is a switching_type and in which said control_circuit includes a timer and ramp_signal_generator for supplying clock_signals to said switching multiplier and ramp_signals to said pulse width_modulator ''
Id.at col._6,_ll._39-43

Pioneer 's patent attorney Keith Beecher filed the application that matured into the ¡¬366_patent on May_12,_1986
The application included nine claims : claim 1 ( the only independent claim ) and claims 2-9
Four of these original_claims are relevant to the issue at hand : 4
The combination defined in claim 3 in which said control_circuit includes a multiplier.. 5
The combination defined in claim 4 and which includes.. circuit_means.. *1355 6
The combination defined in claim 5 in which said last-named circuit_means includes a pulse width_modulator
7
The combination defined in claim 6 in which said multiplier is a switching_type and in which said control_circuit includes a timer and ramp_signal_generator for supplying clock_signals to said switching multiplier and ramp_signals to said pulse width_modulator

( Emphasis added )

The examiner rejected original_claims 1-BIG_TOKEN__5_and_8__BIG_TOKEN -BIG_TOKEN__9_under_35__BIG_TOKEN U.S.C.¡± 102 ( b ) as anticipated by United_States_Patent_No._4437,146 ( the Carpenter reference )
This reference did not disclose a switching multiplier_circuit or a pulse-width_modulator
The examiner then rejected original_claim 6 as indefinite under 35 U.S.C.¡± 112 second paragraph stating that `` [ t ] he phrase 'said last-named circuit_means ' lacks proper antecedent basis in the claims ''
Claim 7 was dependent upon claim 6 and therefore was rejected on the same basis

Pioneer did not dispute the rejection
Instead it amended original_claims 1_and_7 and cancelled original_claims 2-6
The amendments to claim 1 imported claims 2-6 and had the relevant substantive effect of changing `` circuit_means '' in original_claim 5 to `` circuit_means including a pulse-width_modulator '' and changing the `` multiplier '' in original_claim 4 to a `` switching analog '' multiplier_circuit
In the remarks section of its amended application Pioneer explained It is believed clear that there is no showing in the cited Carpenter Patent 4,437,146 of the specific combination set forth in amended claim 1
It is also noted that amended claim 1 represents original_claim 6 in independent form and that claim 6 has been amended to overcome the objection raised under 35 USC ¡± 112
Despite twice stating that amended claim 1 incorporated original_claims 2-6 Pioneer offered no explanation for its addition of the `` switching analog '' limitation not present in original_claims 1-6

As it stated in its remarks Pioneer also amended original_claim 7 ( issued as final claim 2 ) to depend on amended claim 1 and to specify that the switching multiplier recited in claim 7 be a `` pulse-width '' type
On January 21 1987 the examiner held a telephone interview with Beecher to propose an amendment deleting this `` pulse-width '' limitation
With this additional amendment the examiner allowed the claims
The patent issued on June_30,_1987

More than eight years later on December 14 1995 Pioneer filed suit against Micro_Linear alleging infringement of the ¡¬366_patent
In motions seeking interpretation of the claims the parties requested the court to identify what equivalents of the `` switching multiplier '' limitation if any are barred by prosecution_history_estoppel
In support of its motion Pioneer offered a declaration by Beecher that the reason he added the `` switching '' limitation to claim 1 was inadvertence
The court concluded that a `` non-switching multiplier '' is outside the permissible range of equivalents of this limitation because Pioneer narrowed claim 1 by adding limitations including the `` switching '' limitation to meet the objections of the Patent and Trademark Office as to the patentability of the claim in light of prior art
In response to this ruling the parties stipulated that summary_judgment of non-infringement be deemed granted to Micro_Linear on the grounds that its accused products do not *1356 literally infringe any of the claims of the ¡¬366_patent and that prosecution_history_estoppel bars Pioneer from asserting under the doctrine of equivalents that the accused products infringe claims containing the `` switching analog_multiplier_circuit '' limitation
The district_court approved the stipulation and entered a final judgment of non-infringement
