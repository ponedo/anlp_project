OPINION
MAYER Circuit_Judge
Merck & Co. Inc. sued Biocraft_Laboratories Inc. for infringement of its patent U.S._Patent_No._3781,430
The United_States_District_Court for the District of New_Jersey held that Biocraft failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that the patent was invalid or unenforceable and enjoined Biocraft from commercially making using and selling the claimed diuretic formulations
Merck & Co. Inc. v. Biocraft_Laboratories Inc. 690_F.Supp._1376 ( D.N.J.1988 )
Biocraft appeals only the validity aspect of the judgment arguing that the claimed combinations would have been obvious under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103
We agree and accordingly reverse the judgment of the district court

Background
The '430_Patent : In relevant part U.S._Patent_No._3781,430 ( the '430_patent ) assigned to Merck claims various `` Diuretic Formulations ''
Inducing diuresis ( increased urine excretion ) or saluresis ( increased electrolyte particularly sodium excretion ) or both diuretics are useful in the treatment of cardiovascular and renal diseases
Although the therapeutic effects of diuretics are often lifesaving many cause hypokalemia the excessive excretion of potassium_ions a condition manifested by severe muscle weakness and physical exhaustion

In the formulations claimed in the '430_patent amiloride_hydrochloride ( amiloride ) a known `` potassium conserving '' diuretic ( induces sodium but not potassium excretion ) is combined with hydrochlorothiazide a known `` potassium excreting '' diuretic ( induces both sodium and potassium excretion )
As stated in the specification the objective of co-administration is to reduce the amount of potassium_ions eliminated without reducing the amount of sodium ions eliminated
The inventor also reports that co-administration results in a `` medically.. synergistic therapeutic accomplishment '' because `` more sodium ions are eliminated than would be forecast from a knowledge of the natriuretic [ sodium excreting ] effects of the individual drugs ''

The '430_patent contains six claims
The parties agree however that all of the claims stand or fall with claims 2_and_3
Claim 1 on which claim 2 depends and claims 2_and_3 provide as follows : 1
A composition for oral_administration comprising amiloride_hydrochloride and *806 hydrochlorothiazide wherein the ratio of amiloride_hydrochloride to hydrochlorothiazide ranges from about 1 : 1_to_1 :10 by weight of the composition
2
A composition according to claim 1 wherein amiloride_hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide are combined at a ratio of 1_to_1 0 by weight
3
A composition for oral_administration which comprises 5 mg. of amiloride_hydrochloride and 50 mg. of hydrochlorothiazide
