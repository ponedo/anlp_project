Opinion
PAULINE NEWMAN Circuit_Judge
Verve LLC appeals the decision of the United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Michigan,1 granting summary_judgment that claims 1 6 and 13 of United States Patent No._4850,315 ( the ¡¬315_patent ) are invalid
We reverse the *1118 judgment with respect to anticipation vacate with respect to indefiniteness and remand for further proceedings

BACKGROUND
The ¡¬315_patent describes and claims improved push_rods for internal_combustion_engines
Push rods are used to actuate rocker arms which open and close the intake and exhaust valves of cylinders of engines designed for their use
In such engines the push_rods ride on cam followers which are raised and lowered by the camshaft as it rotates
As engine speeds have increased so have the number of piston strokes requiring a corresponding increase in the number of valve openings and closings ; this in turn increases the movement of and forces on the push_rods
Stronger push_rods became necessary and to lighten their weight hollow push_rods were developed
However there was a need for stronger and stiffer rods that could be manufactured from a single_piece of metal without the need for inserts or other supporting structure

The ¡¬315_patent claims a hollow push_rod whose overall diameter is larger at the middle than at the ends and that has substantially constant_wall_thickness throughout the rod and rounded_seats at the tips
This novel shape is said to provide the advantages of increased strength and stiffness permitting higher engine speeds and greater valve train forces
The ¡¬315_patent illustrates the invention as follows :

?
*1119 As seen in the drawings and as required by the claims the push_rod 10¡² is configured whereby the outer_diameter of the middle_portion is larger than the outer_diameter of the end_portions 18_and_20
The end_portions have a rounded tip 52 forming a seat that engages a pocket of a cam follower at one end and a pocket of a rocker arm at the other end
The shape of the push_rod provides increased strength and because it is hollow it is relatively light
Since the rounded tips are integrally formed there are no problems with disengagement and the rod is relatively inexpensive to manufacture
Claim 1 is representative : 1
A push_rod for an internal combustion engine comprising : a single_piece of metal in the form of an elongated hollow tube having a middle_portion first and second end_portions and rounded_seats at the tips thereof said middle_portion having a larger outer_diameter than the end_portions and said tube having substantially constant_wall_thickness throughout the length of the tube and the tips thereon
The district court granted summary_judgment of invalidity on two grounds : that the claims are indefinite and that the claimed invention is anticipated
