Synopsis
Owner of patent and patent_application claiming automobile anti-theft device brought action challenging decision of the Board of Patent_Appeals and Interferences in interference_proceeding declaring patent and application claims invalid as obvious
Competitor 's motion to transfer action to California was denied 1998_WL_268279
Following bench trial the United_States_District_Court for the District of Columbia Stanley Sporkin J. 11_F.Supp.2d_18 overturned Board 's decision and competitor appealed
The Court of Appeals Michel Circuit_Judge held that : ( 1 ) owner 's submission to district_court of live testimony on all matters before the Board required court to conduct trial de novo ; ( 2 ) patent was not invalid as obvious ; ( 3 ) allowing allegedly late-disclosed witnesses to testify was not abuse of discretion ; ( 4 ) evidence regarding nexus between commercial_success of claimed invention and patentably distinct feature of invention was admissible ; and ( 5 ) competitor was not entitled to transfer

Opinion
MICHEL Circuit_Judge
Ching-Rong Wang ( `` Wang '' ) appeals from the judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the District of Columbia overturning the decision of the United States Patent and Trademark Office Board of Patent_Appeals and Interferences ( the `` Board '' ) in an interference and holding that the inventions of claims 2_and_4 of U.S._Patent_No._4935,047 ( `` the '047_patent `` ) and claims 9-11 of U.S. Patent App
No._07 /478,411 ( `` the '411 application '' ) would not have been obvious in light of the cited prior_art
See Winner_Int ' l_Royalty_Corp. v. Wang 11_F.Supp.2d_18 48_USPQ2d_1139_(D.D.C._June_12,_1998)
The '047_patent issued to Jinn Wu ( `` Wu '' ) and the '411 application are owned by Winner_International_Royalty_Corp. ( `` Winner '' )
The district_court had jurisdiction pursuant to 35 U.S.C.¡± 146 ( 1994 ) because Wu filed suit there after an adverse ruling by the Board in an interference between himself and Wang
Winner as owner of Wu 's patent superseded Wu as plaintiff
The Board held the Wu patent and application claims invalid as obvious
See 35 U.S.C.¡± 103 ( 1994 )
Other litigation ( including suit against Wang ) in which Winner alleges infringement of its '047_patent and asserts several related claims has been stayed in the Central_District of California pending the outcome of this appeal
The district_court first denied Wang 's motion to transfer this action to the District_Court for the Central_District of California
See Winner_Int ' l_Royalty_Corp. v. Wang 45_USPQ2d_1864 1998_WL_268279 ( D.D.C
Jan.20 1998 )
Then it conducted a 7 day_bench_trial
On appeal Wang challenges ( 1 ) the denial of the transfer ; ( 2 ) rulings as to the admission of evidence despite its similarity to that before the Board ; and ( 3 ) the holding of non-obviousness that revived the '047_patent
This case was submitted for our decision following oral argument on August 2 1999
Because the district_court did not clearly err in any of its factual_findings relating to obviousness did not err in its ultimate determination of non-obviousness and did not abuse its discretion either in admitting the challenged documentary_evidence and testimony or in refusing to transfer the case we affirm

BACKGROUND
In addition to the '047_patent Winner also owns U.S._Patent_No._4738,127 ( `` Johnson '' ) the commercial embodiment of which is the original steering_wheel anti-theft device known as `` The Club ''
Wu the principal in the Taiwanese manufacturer of the original Club is named as the inventor in the '047_patent commercial_embodiments of which are known as `` The Super Club '' `` The Ultra Club '' and `` The Club GL ''
The '047_patent discloses an automobile *1343 anti-theft device that is mounted across the steering_wheel and is locked in place by use of a self-locking ratcheting mechanism
Like all versions of the Club when locked in place the commercial_embodiments of the '047_patent prevent theft by blocking the steering_wheel from turning
The ratcheting mechanism is different from the dead-bolt used in Johnson and so the '047_patent may be thought of as an improvement over Johnson
While Johnson 's dead-bolt system is more secure it is not as convenient as the ratcheting mechanism claimed in the '047_patent because a key is required to lock the Johnson device in place while the '047_patent discloses a device that locks itself without use of a key.1

Wang also manufactures similar anti-theft devices in Taiwan and exports them to the U.S. where he sells them through his United States distributor
Wang 's device is known commercially as `` The Gorilla Grip ''
Wang filed a patent_application directed to his Gorilla Grip device and was issued U.S._Patent_No._4887,443 ( `` the '443_patent `` )

In 1990 Wu discovered that the device disclosed in Wang 's '443_patent was very similar to the subject matter of his then-pending application which later issued as the '047_patent and decided to provoke an interference by filing a divisional application and submitting a claim identical to the broadest claim in the '443_patent
On August 8 1991 an interference was declared and a proceeding began to determine which party Wu or Wang had priority of invention
The claims of the '047_patent and an additional Wu application the '411 application were eventually added to the count in the interference

During the interference_proceeding Wang filed a preliminary motion alleging that the interference count and hence both parties ' claims was unpatentable as obvious in light of certain prior_art under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103 ( 1994 )
Wang apparently acknowledging that his claim to priority over Wu 's '047_patent was questionable ultimately conceded that his '443_patent was invalid and sought to prove that Wu 's '047_patent was also invalid

After a final hearing the Board in a split decision held all affected claims invalid except for claims 1_and_3 of the '047_patent
Wu then filed both an appeal to this court pursuant to 35 U.S.C.¡± 141 ( 1994 ) and an action in the District_Court for the District of Columbia pursuant to 35 U.S.C.¡± 146 while Wang filed a section 146 action in the District_Court for the Central_District of California
In Wu 's section 141 appeal from the decision of the Board this court determined that the section 146 suit would proceed pursuant to Wu 's complaint in the District_Court for the District of Columbia
See Wu v. Wang 129_F.3d_1237 44_USPQ2d_1641_(Fed.Cir.1997)
Because Wu filed his appeal first and responded in timely fashion to Wang 's notice of election by filing a section 146 action in the District_Court for the District of Columbia Wu 's choice of forum governed
See id.at 1242-43 44 USPQ2d at 1645-46
We then dismissed the section 141 appeal as superseded by the section 146 action
See id.at 1238 44 USPQ2d at 1642

After the first appeal to this court Wang filed a motion in the district_court to transfer the action to the Central_District of California
The district_court denied the motion
See Winner 45_USPQ2d_1864
After a seven-day_bench_trial the district_court held that the inventions of claims 2_and_4 of the '047_patent would not have been obvious in light of the cited prior_art
See Winner 11_F.Supp.2d_18 48_USPQ2d_11392 At trial Winner presented testimony on each of the four principal factual issues underlying an obviousness *1344 determination as well as affidavits
Wang presented one expert witness to testify as to his opinion regarding obviousness and the underlying factual determinations
The record before the Board was also admitted into evidence before the district_court

The focus of the trial was on four prior_art_references that Wang alleged before the court as he had before the Board rendered the invention of the '047_patent obvious
These references were Johnson ( mentioned above ) U.S. Patent No._3462,982 ( `` Moore '' ) Taiwan Patent App
No._74210,699 ( `` WuROC '' ) and French Patent App
No._2566,398 ( `` Grimaldi '' )
Winner also introduced evidence of the commercial_success of its Super Club line of products
This evidence had not been presented to the Board

Like the device disclosed in the '047_patent the mechanism of Johnson immobilizes the steering_wheel by the user inserting it within the steering_wheel telescoping its arms outward so that hooks on the end of the arms engage the steering_wheel and then locking the arms in place
As stated earlier unlike the '047_patent which discloses a self-locking ratcheting mechanism Johnson uses a dead-bolt to lock the device in place which requires the user to turn a key after putting the device on the wheel
Moore discloses a steering_wheel lock that unfolds into a `` Y '' shape and utilizes a self-locking ratcheting mechanism which does not require a key
WuROC discloses a wheel and brake_pedal locking device with a versatile locking core that can accommodate either a dead-bolt or a self-locking ratcheting mechanism but it does not disclose either of these locking mechanisms
Grimaldi discloses a two-piece mechanism for locking a clutch or brake_pedal to the floorboard or firewall of a car and its figures appear to show a rod and pawl mechanism that locks it into place

The key issue tried was the presence or absence of sufficient proof of a motivation to combine the four prior_art_references
The Board had found that one skilled in the art ( 1 ) `` would have considered Johnson 's dead-bolt-type locking device to be disadvantageous compared to the Moore and WuROC devices to the extent that Johnson requires a key for setting in position and adjusting the device '' and ( 2 ) `` would have been motivated to make Johnson easier to use albeit less secure by replacing the dead-bolt mechanism '' of Johnson with a suitable self-locking ratcheting mechanism
The district_court found that these factual_findings were `` clearly erroneous '' and found that adequate motivation to combine the references was not shown
See Winner 11 F.Supp.2d at 23-24 48 USPQ2d at 1143-44
The district_court also found that Winner established commercial_success resulting from the improvement claimed in the '047_patent even though it held such a finding immaterial in light of Wang 's failure to establish a prima facie case of obviousness
See id
Accordingly the district_court held that on this record the inventions of claims 2_and_4 of the '047_patent would not have been obvious and overturned the Board 's decision as to those claims
See id.at 25 48 USPQ2d at 1145

Wang appeals contending that the district_court should have applied a substantial evidence standard of review on factual issues rather than as it said it was doing review for clear error
Wang asserts that the district_court incorrectly concluded that the invention of the claims would not have been obvious and abused its discretion in admitting the challenged documentary_evidence and testimony as duplicative of evidence in the Board record and in denying Wang 's motion to transfer the case to the Central_District of California
We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 3 ) ( C ) ( 1994 )
