Synopsis
Background : Manufacturer of genetically modified corn seed brought declaratory_judgment_action against patentee challenging the validity and enforceability of four patents relating to the expression in plants of bacteria strains toxic to certain_crop-destroying insects and asserting its products did not infringe these patents
After the Court of Appeals Bryson Circuit_Judge 363_F.3d_1235 reversed and remanded the decision of the United States District_Court for the Eastern_District of Missouri E. Richard Webber J. 264_F.Supp.2d_852 granting summary_judgment in favor of manufacturer the District_Court after a jury_trial declared asserted claims of one patent invalid and non-infringed and all four patents unenforceable for inequitable_conduct
Patentee appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Gajarsa Circuit_Judge held that :

notes of one of patentee 's employees were material to patent prosecution and

District_Court did not clearly err in concluding that patentee intentionally withheld notes with intent to deceive Patent and Trademark Office ( PTO )

Affirmed

Opinion
GAJARSA Circuit_Judge
This is a patent infringement case relating to chimeric_genes
Plaintiff-Appellee Monsanto Co. ( `` Monsanto '' ) brought a declaratory_judgment_action against Defendant-Appellant Bayer Bioscience N.V. ( `` Bayer '' ) challenging the validity and unenforceability of four Bayer patents U.S. Patent Nos._5545,565 ( `` the ¡¬565_patent `` ) 5,767,372 ( `` the ¡¬372_patent `` ) 6,107,546 ( `` the ¡¬546_patent `` ) and 5,254,799 ( `` the ¡¬799_patent `` ) and asserting that Monsanto 's transgenic corn products did not infringe these patents
Bayer appeals a final_judgment issued after jury_trial declaring the asserted claims of the ¡¬565_patent invalid and non-infringed
In addition Bayer appeals the final_judgment of the district_court that the four patents are unenforceable for inequitable_conduct
We affirm the district_court 's conclusion that the ¡¬565_patent is unenforceable for inequitable_conduct and hold that the district_court had jurisdiction to declare the ¡¬372 ¡¬546 and ¡¬ 799 patents unenforceable
Accordingly we do not reach the other_issues raised by Bayer on appeal

I
Strains of the bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis ( `` Bt '' ) produce proteins known as Bt toxins that while harmless for humans and most animals are toxic to certain_crop-destroying insects
In the 1980s multiple companies and academic groups took advantage of the newly emergent science of genetic engineering by attempting to insert a gene for Bt toxin into plants through a process known as transformation
The goal was for these genetically engineered plants to express ( i.e. produce ) a Bt toxin protein in sufficient quantities to make the plants insect-resistant.1 Difficulties *1232 in getting plants to express a full-length Bt_toxin_gene which encodes a protein of approximately 130 kD,2 led researchers to investigate various alternatives
In 1986 Plant Genetic Systems N.V. a predecessor of Bayer ( hereinafter referred to as `` Bayer '' ) succeeded in obtaining plants that expressed a truncated form of a Bt toxin
This shortened protein was produced by transforming the plants with a fragment of a Bt_toxin_gene that encoded the first part ( or N-terminal end ) of the toxin using the bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens ( `` Agrobacterium `` ) a known system for plant transformation.3

The four patents involved in the present suit relate to this invention
The ¡¬ 565 patent claims chimeric_genes4 comprising ( a ) a truncated Bt_toxin_gene encoding an approximately 60 kD to 80 kD Bt toxin of a specific amino acid sequence,5 and ( b ) the regulatory region of a gene `` naturally expressed in plant_cells '' 6 which enables the gene to be transcribed in plants i.e. a `` plant promoter '' where the Bt_toxin_gene is under the control of the plant promoter.7 The ¡¬372_patent ¡¬546_patent and the ¡¬799_patent are directed towards various other aspects of the technology including plant_cells and plants that produce the insecticidal protein and methods of transforming plants with the chimeric_genes

Monsanto sells a genetically modified corn product MON810 that expresses a Bt toxin with the same amino acid sequence claimed by Bayer
In December 2000 Monsanto filed a declaratory_judgment_action in the Eastern_District of Missouri seeking a declaration that its product did not infringe the ¡¬565 ¡¬ 372 ¡¬546 and ¡¬799_patent s and that these patents were invalid and unenforceable
Bayer counterclaimed *1233 alleging infringement of certain claims in each patent
The district_court initially granted summary_judgment to Monsanto holding that all four patents were unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct that certain patent claims were invalid and that the ¡¬ 565 patent was not infringed
Bayer appealed to this court
We reversed the trial court 's claim_construction as to the term `` Bt2 toxin '' and vacated the unenforceability and invalidity judgments
Monsanto Co. v. Bayer_BioScience_N.V. 363_F.3d_1235 ( Fed.Cir.2004 ) ( Monsanto I )
In particular we held that the summary_judgment of unenforceability based on inequitable_conduct during the prosecution of the ¡¬799_patent was improper because there were material facts in dispute and we concluded that the district_court erred in giving collateral estoppel effect to an earlier case between predecessors of the parties in this case and basing its invalidity findings on this estoppel

On remand Bayer dismissed all claims that MON810 infringed the ¡¬799 ¡¬372 and ¡¬546_patent s and filed a Statement of Non-Liability as to these patents
Accordingly when the case proceeded to trial only the ¡¬565_patent was at issue
The jury found the asserted claims of the ¡¬565_patent not infringed and invalid for obviousness and prior_invention by Monsanto

Subsequently the district_court held a four-day bench trial on inequitable_conduct
In a 99-page opinion the district_court found materiality and intent for two separate acts relating to the ¡¬565_patent and concluded that inequitable_conduct made the ¡¬565_patent unenforceable

op
( E.D.Mo
Aug._28,_2006 ) ( Monsanto II )
The court also found inequitable_conduct in the prosecution of the ¡¬799 ¡¬372 and ¡¬546_patent s and accordingly held these patents unenforceable
Id.at 95
Bayer appealed
We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )

In the current appeal Bayer argues that the district_court erred in claim_construction that allegedly prejudicial evidence was admitted during the jury_trial that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the jury_findings of prior_invention and obviousness that the district_court erred in finding the ¡¬ 565 patent unenforceable for inequitable_conduct and that the district_court lacked jurisdiction to find the ¡¬799 ¡¬372 and ¡¬546_patent s unenforceable

Because we affirm the district_court 's holding that the ¡¬565_patent is unenforceable for inequitable_conduct we need not reach the other_issues raised by Bayer relating to the jury_findings of invalidity and non-infringement of the patent
See eSpeed Inc. v. Brokertec USA L.L.C. 480_F.3d_1129 1138-39 ( Fed.Cir.2007 )
Accordingly we review only the district_court 's inequitable_conduct holdings
