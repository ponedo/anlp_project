Synopsis
Background : Owner of patents relating to inverter_controllers which convert low_voltage_direct_current ( DC ) into higher_voltage alternating current ( AC ) brought infringement action against competitors
The United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Texas T. John Ward J. 2007_WL_869576 inter_alia granted patent_owner a permanent_injunction
Competitors appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Prost Circuit_Judge held that :

competitors did not waive on appeal any objection to claim construction determined at Markman hearing ;

arguments regarding the meaning and legal significance of `` only if '' limitation were improperly submitted to the jury ; and

prosecution history estoppel barred patent_owner from relying on the doctrine of equivalents

Vacated and remanded

PROST Circuit_Judge
Defendants-Appellants Beyond Innovation Technology Company Limited ( `` BiTEK '' ) SPI Electronic Company Limited and FSP_Group ( collectively `` SPI/FSP '' ) and Lien Chang Electronic Enterprise Company Limited ( `` Lien Chang '' ) appeal a final_judgment by the United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Texas
O2_Micro Int ' l Ltd. v. Beyond Innovation Tech Co. No._2 :04-CV-32 2007_WL_869576 ( E.D.Tex
Mar

A jury found that Defendants-Appellants willfully induced the infringement of claims 1 15 35 and 39 of U.S._Patent_No._6259,615 ( `` the ¡¬615_patent `` ) claims 12_and_16 of U.S._Patent_No._6396,722 ( `` the ¡¬722_patent `` ) and claims 13 16 and 17 of U.S._Patent_No._6804,129 ( `` the ¡¬129_patent `` ) all of which are owned by Plaintiff-Appellee O2_Micro International Ltd. ( `` O2_Micro '' )
The district court entered a final_judgment and permanent_injunction
For the reasons explained below we vacate and remand for further proceedings

BACKGROUND
A. Patents-in-Suit
The patents-in-suit1 are directed to DC-to-AC_converter_circuits which convert low_voltage_direct_current ( `` DC '' ) into higher_voltage alternating current ( `` AC '' )
Also called inverter_controllers these circuits may be used to control the amount of power delivered to cold cathode fluorescent lamps ( `` CCFLs '' ) that are used to backlight the screens of laptop computers and televisions
When powered by a battery or other DC power source a CCFL uses a DC-to-AC_converter_circuit because CCFLs are designed to run on AC power
The patents-in-suit describe a converter_circuit that employs a feedback_control_loop to control the amount of power delivered from the DC power source ( the `` drive '' ) to the CCFL ( the `` load '' )

As shown in Figure 2 of the ¡¬615_patent the converter_circuit includes a number of switches ( 80 ) placed between the drive ( 12 ) and the load ( 20 )
Drive circuitry ( 50 ) associated with each switch determines when and how long a given switch will be turned on ( `` ON time '' )
If a pair of switches along a conduction path are ON simultaneously the circuit will deliver more power to the load
Thus by adjusting the overlap between switches ' ON_times the circuit can precisely control the amount of power delivered to the load

*1355. ?
¡¬615_patent 's Figure 2
The converter_circuit uses a feedback_control_loop ( 40 ) to affect the switches ' ON_times
To the feedback_control_loop the converter_circuit provides a feedback_signal ( FB ) indicative of the total_current ( and thus power ) at the load and a reference_voltage ( REF ) indicative of the desired load conditions ( for example the desired total_current at the load )
An error amplifier ( 32 ) compares the feedback_signal ( FB ) and the reference_voltage ( REF ) to produce a comparison_signal ( CMP )
During normal_operation the drive_circuitry ( 50 ) receives the comparison_signal ( 94 ) and may use it to adjust the switches ' ON_times thereby regulating the power to the load
To protect the circuitry from damage during an open-circuit condition ( such as when a CCFL breaks or becomes disconnected ) the feedback_signal ( FB ) may also be compared to a reference_value ( not shown in Figure 2 ) at the current_sense_comparator ( 42 )
This reference_value preferably reflects the minimum or maximum current permitted by the system
Thus when the value of the feedback_signal ( FB ) is within a permitted range ( i.e. during normal_operation ) the current_sense_comparator ( 42 ) allows the comparison_signal ( CMP ) to flow through switch 38 ; however when the value of the feedback_signal is outside that range ( e.g. during an open circuit or short circuit condition ) the current_sense_comparator substitutes a minimum_voltage ( Vmin ) for the comparison_signal ( CMP ) at switch 38
In the latter case the minimum_voltage minimizes the overlap of the switches ' ON_times reducing the power to a safer level while avoiding shutdown if the lamp remains operable

During prosecution of the application the examiner rejected the ¡¬615_patent under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103 as unpatentable over a combination of U.S. Patent No._5384,516 to Kawabata ( `` Kawabata '' ) and U.S._Patent_No._6011,360 to Gradzki ( `` Gradzki '' )
*1356 The examiner observed that the feedback loop described in the originally filed claims was obvious stating that `` Gradzki et al
teaches the utilization of the technique for a feedback loop circuit between the load and the drive_circuitry supplying a feedback_signal indicative of power being supplied to the load ''
J.A
7638
The examiner found that like the application 's pending claims Gradzki discloses an inverter controller that regulates lamp power irrespective of the level of the feedback_signal

In response to the examiner 's rejection O2_Micro added a limitation to each of the independent claims
Specifically O2_Micro amended Claim 1 of the ¡¬ 615 patent to require that the feedback_control_loop_circuit control the conduction_state of the switches `` only if said feedback_signal is above a predetermined threshold '' ( the `` 'only if ' limitation '' )
O2_Micro provided little explanation for the amendment stating that `` [ i ] n contrast to [ the prior art ] Applicant 's invention of independent claim 1 requires inter_alia a DC/AC_converter_circuit that includes a feedback_control_loop_circuit.. adapted to generate a second pulse signal.. only if said feedback_signal is above a predetermined threshold ''
J.A
7626
After receiving this amendment the examiner issued a notice of allowance

Claim 1 of the ¡¬615_patent is representative of the asserted claims for the issues presented by this appeal
As issued it requires in relevant part a DC/AC_converter_circuit comprising : a feedback_control_loop_circuit receiving a feedback_signal indicative of power being supplied to said load and adapted to generate a second signal pulse signal for controlling the conduction_state of said second plurality of switches only if said feedback_signal is above a predetermined threshold ; '615_patent col. 10 l.67-col. 11 l.5
