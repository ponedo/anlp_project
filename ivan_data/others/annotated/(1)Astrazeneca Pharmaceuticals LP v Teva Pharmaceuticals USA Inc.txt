Opinion
NEWMAN Circuit_Judge
Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. Teva_Pharmaceutical_Industries Ltd. and Sandoz Inc. appeal from the grant by the United_States_District_Court for the District of New_Jersey of AstraZeneca_Pharmaceuticals_LP and AstraZeneca UK Limited 's motion for summary_judgment of no inequitable_conduct.1 The district_court ruled that the Appellants had not presented evidence sufficient for a reasonable jury to find that in prosecution of the subject patent application in the Patent and Trademark Office ( `` PTO '' ) AstraZeneca made a misrepresentation of material_fact or an omission of material_fact with intent to deceive or mislead the patent examiner into granting the patent
We affirm the district_court 's ruling

BACKGROUND
AstraZeneca is the assignee of United States Patent No._4879,288 ( `` the ¡¬ 288 patent '' ) which claims the antipsychotic_drug_quetiapine having the following structural formula :

?
AstraZeneca markets quetiapine under the brand name `` SEROQUELTHE_R ''
The ¡¬ 288 patent explains that this product is an `` atypical '' antipsychotic drug which means that unlike `` typical '' antipsychotics it does not produce involuntary body movements including torsion spasms muscle spasms and dystonia of the face neck or back with protrusion of the tongue and tonic spasms of the limbs ( dyskinesias )
Such undesirable side effects were not unusual for antipsychotic drugs
An earlier atypical antipsychotic drug clozapine had become available in the 1970s but it was withdrawn from the market after it was discovered to cause a potentially deadly reduction in white blood cell count known as agranulocytosis
The AstraZeneca product quetiapine was approved by the FDA in 1997
The ¡¬288_patent expires on September 26 2011

Teva and Sandoz each filed abbreviated new drug applications ( `` ANDAs '' ) for approval to sell their production of quetiapine under 21 U.S.C.¡± 355 ( j ) certifying under `` paragraph IV '' that the ¡¬288_patent is invalid and/or not infringed
Paragraph IV certifications are by statute an act of technical patent infringement designed to permit litigation of patent issues for products subject to federal regulatory approval
35 U.S.C.¡± 271 ( e ) ( 2 ) ( A )
In accordance with the statutory procedures AstraZeneca filed infringement suits against Teva and Sandoz ; the suits were consolidated in *770 the District Court for the District of New_Jersey
See 21 U.S.C.¡± 355 ( j ) ( 5 ) ( B ) ( iii )

The district_court granted summary_judgment that there was no inequitable_conduct in prosecution of the ¡¬288_patent application
That is the only issue of this appeal
