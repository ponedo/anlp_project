714_F.2d_1573
United States Court of Appeals Federal Circuit
RICHDEL INC. Plaintiff-Appellant v. SUNSPOOL CORPORATION Defendant-Appellee
Appeal No._83-611
| Aug._3,_1983
Synopsis
Plaintiff appealed from a judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of California holding a patent claim by plaintiff invalid and unenforceable
The Court of Appeals Rich Circuit_Judge held that : ( 1 ) it was error for the trial court to have shifted the burden of proof and so require plaintiff to prove facts necessary to a conclusion of nonobviousness and ( 2 ) the evidence was sufficient to sustain the finding that claim one of patent No._4191,166 relating to a solar_water_heater_system was obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made and thus the claim was invalid

Opinion
RICH Circuit_Judge
This appeal is from the October 22 1982 judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of California holding claim 1 of U.S._patent_No._4191,166 ( the '166_patent ) owned by appellant Richdel Inc. ( Richdel ) invalid and unenforceable and dismissing the suit
We affirm

Jurisdiction in this court is under 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 ) the above judgment being a `` final decision ''

Background
The '166_patent entitled `` Solar Heat System '' was granted March_4,_1980 to Saarem et al
on an application filed December 27 1977
Figure 1 thereof is reproduced below :

*1575. ?
The figure is a schematic representation of one embodiment of the claimed invention
Shown in the drawing are solar collector 10 valve_module 20 pump module 12 storage_tank 16 and control_module 32
Solid lines represent fluid flow pathways and evenly broken lines show electrical connections
The dot-and-dash lines encompass the module elements
Also shown in the drawing are temperature sensors 34_and_36 disposed to sense the temperatures of the water in the collector and storage_tank respectively

The sensors control_module and valve_module cooperate to perform several functions most notably to shut the system down and drain the collector when it is so cold outside that the water would otherwise freeze in and damage the collector
The sensors detect the dangerously cold condition and the control_module responds causing valve 28 to close and valves 22_and_26 to open thereby draining the collector
This feature is sometimes referred to as automatic_drain-down
The other functions performed are prevention of excessively hot water and shut down when the sensors indicate that no solar heat is available

Claim 1 the only claim on appeal in numbered paragraphed form stipulated to by the parties reads as follows : In a solar_water_heater_system which includes a collector a storage_tank a circulating pump and pipeline means intercoupling the collector storage and circulating pump to enable the pump to circulate a fluid through the collector to be heated therein and returned to the storage_tank said pipeline means including a supply_line extending from the pump to the collector and a return_line extending from the collector to the storage_tank ; the combination of : *1576 ( 1 ) a drain_line ( 2 ) an electrically energized valve_module coupling the pipeline means to the drain_line and
( 3 ) a control_module connected to the valve_module for selectively establishing the valve_module in an energized_operating_condition in which a circulating path for the fluid is established from the pump through the collector to the storage_tank and for selectively establishing the valve_module in a de-energized_operating_condition in which the fluid in the collector is discharged through the drain_lines ; said valve_module including : ( a ) electrically activated means for selectively establishing the valve_module in its energized_operating_condition in response to an electric signal from the control_module and
( b ) spring_means for establishing the valve_module in its de-energized_operating_condition in the absence of such electrical signal and said valve_module further including
( c ) a first_valve interposed in the supply_line said first_valve being set to an open operating position by said electrically activated means when said valve_module is in its energized_operating_condition and said first_valve being set to a closed operating position by said spring_means when said valve_module is in its de-energizing operating condition and
( d ) said valve_module including a pair of valves respectively coupling the supply_line and the return_line to the drain valve said pair of valves being set to a closed position by said electrically activated means when said valve_module is in its energized_operating_condition and said pair of valves being set to an open position by said spring_means when said valve_module is in its de-energized_operating_condition

Figure 6 of the '166_patent shows the type of valve disclosed
While the valve_module figures prominently in the claim the claim appears to be directed to a sub-combination in a solar heater system not to the valve_module per se
Realistically read the claimed combination includes practically all the elements of the entire system

?
The figure on the left shows the valve which Richdel describes as a multi-port disc valve in an open or normal operating position in which the disc 68 is held in turned position by a stalled motor
In this position port_V_communicates with central port D. To drain the system the motor is de-energized and a biasing spring turns disc 68 to the position shown in the right hand figure
In this position port_V_communicates with port P and ports C1 and C2 with port D. Ports C1 and C2 correspond to valves 22_and_26 in Fig._1
Valve 28 in Fig._1 is a diaphragm valve with an actuating chamber containing port V. This means that valve 28 is open or closed according to whether port V is open or closed
A valve such as valve 28 which is controlled by the flow of fluid through a smaller associated valve is called a pilot-operated valve and the smaller valve is called the pilot_valve

*1577 The prior_art relied upon by the district_court includes U.S._patent_No._4119,087 to Cook
The Cook_system is shown in Fig._1 of his patent reproduced below :

?
The Cook_system has a solar energy collector 10 solenoid_valves 20 24 25 and 26 a solar circulator or pump 17 storage_tank 1 control_box 27 and sensor 19
The figure does not show that the control_box 27 sensor 19 and the solenoid_valves are electrically interconnected to effect freeze protection

The other prior_art is a system manufactured by Sunsav Inc. a valve package manufactured by Heliotrope General and U.S._patent_No._4061,132 to Ashton et al
The Sunsav system is similar to the Cook_system except that it uses a pair of three-way solenoid_valves rather than three separate valves
The Heliotrope General valve package comprises a pair of solenoid_valves
It was designed to be used with an existing solar_water_heating_system and when used with a separately available control system implemented automatic_drain-down in that system
The Ashton patent discloses a solar swimming pool heater which drains automatically *1578 when the sunlight is not heating the water

The type of valve used in all of these prior_art systems is a pilot-operated solenoid valve
In such a valve the flow through the pilot_valve is controlled by a rod inserted into the hollow center of a cylindrical coil
The rod moves according to the presence or absence of a solenoidal magnetic field created by the flow of electrical_current through the coil
In this fashion fluid flow can be controlled by controlling the electrical_current
The record indicates that these valves proved unsatisfactory for drain-down applications for several reasons : they are noisy ; they consume large amounts of power ; and as pilot-operated valves they depend on flow through small orifices which easily become clogged with particulate contaminants commonly found in water supplies

None of the prior_art relied on by the district_court was cited by the Patent and Trademark Office ( PTO ) during the course of prosecution of the '166_patent

Richdel alleged contributory infringement under 35 U.S.C.¡± 271 ( c ) by defendant Sunspool based upon its manufacture use and sale of `` drain valves embodying the invention of '' the '166_patent
Sunspool manufactures a multi-port spool valve which it bills as `` The reliable drain-down valve for solar collector freeze protection ''
This spool valve has a thermosensitive actuator which contracts or expands along its length according to its temperature
The actuator is disposed in close proximity to an electrically resistive element
The amount of current through the element controls its temperature and thereby controls the length of the actuator
Sunspool 's valve is described in its literature as a `` direct acting spool mechanism for positive flow control '' and is therefore not a pilot-operated valve
Richdel 's Vice President of Engineering one of the '166_patent ees testified that Richdel redesigned the commercial embodiment of its solar_water_heating_system to include spool valves instead of the disc-type valve described in the '166 specification after complaints about performance of the latter
