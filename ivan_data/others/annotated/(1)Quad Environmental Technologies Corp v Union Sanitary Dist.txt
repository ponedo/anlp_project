The United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of California Fern M. Smith J. granted defendant 's motion for summary_judgment of invalidity for obviousness
Inventor 's assignee appealed
The Court of Appeals Pauline Newman Circuit_Judge held that : ( 1 ) assignee 's filing of terminal disclaimer to obviate double patenting issue was not admission that claims of subsequent_patent were obvious in view of disclosure of previous_patent and therefore assignee was not estopped from arguing that claims of subsequent_patent were unobvious in view of process which embodied invention of previous_patent and ( 2 ) examiner could not have based reexamination on admission of public use and therefore assignee was not estopped from defending validity on that ground

Reversed and remanded

Opinion
PAULINE NEWMAN Circuit_Judge
Quad Environmental Technologies Corporation appeals the summary_judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of California holding all *872 the claims of the patent in suit invalid on the basis of obviousness.1 The district court did not reach the issues of infringement and inequitable conduct deeming them mooted

We conclude that summary_judgment was improvidently granted based on errors of law
Since material disputed facts require resolution we reverse the grant of summary_judgment and remand for trial

Summary Judgment
The process of summary_judgment is a salutary means of avoiding an unnecessary trial when the movant is clearly entitled to judgment as a matter of law
Fed.R.Civ.P
56 ( c ) ; Anderson v. Liberty Lobby Inc. 477_U.S._242 247 106_S.Ct._2505 2509-10 91_L.Ed.2d_202_(1986) ; Celotex Corp. v. Catrett 477_U.S._317 322-23 106_S.Ct._2548 2552 91_L.Ed.2d_265_(1986)
The burden of establishing entitlement to summary disposition is with the movant with due consideration to the presumptions and burdens that characterize the issues in dispute

Robertson Co. v. United Steel Deck Inc. 820_F.2d_384 388 2_USPQ2d_1926 1928 ( Fed.Cir.1987 )
The reviewing court must determine for itself whether the requirements for summary_judgment were met
Id

When the issue is patent invalidity due to obviousness 35 U.S.C.¡± 103 the movant must overcome the statutory presumption of validity 35 U.S.C.¡± 282 by proving obviousness by clear and convincing evidence based on undisputed facts
All factual inferences must be drawn in favor of the opponent of the motion
Anderson 477 U.S. at 255 106 S.Ct.at 2513 ; Cooper v. Ford Motor Co. 748_F.2d_677 679 223_USPQ_1286 1288 ( Fed.Cir.1984 )
Although patent issues are as amenable to summary resolution as other matters when material facts are disputed and testimonial documentary and expert evidence are needed for their resolution summary adjudication is not indicated
Such is here the case
