INTRODUCTION
Par_Pharmaceutical Inc. ( `` Par '' ) Alphapharm_Pty_Ltd. ( `` Alphapharm '' ) and Dr._Reddy 's Laboratories Inc. ( `` DRL '' ) ( collectively `` Appellants '' ) appeal from the final judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Texas
Following a bench trial the district_court determined that the asserted claims of U.S._Patent_No._6060,499 ( filed Sept._11,_1998 ) ( the `` ¡¬499_patent `` ) U.S._Patent_No._6586,458 ( filed Apr._27,_2000 ) ( the `` ¡¬458_patent `` ) and U.S. Patent No._7332,183 ( filed Dec._22,_2003 ) ( the `` ¡¬183_patent `` ) ( collectively `` patents-in-suit '' ) are not invalid as obvious under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103
The district_court also found that the patents-in-suit were infringed by Par and DRL 's Abbreviated_New_Drug_Application ( `` ANDA '' ) filings
As a result Par and DRL were enjoined from making using importing selling or offering to sell their generic_products in the United States.1 We affirm the district_court 's decision because it did not err in finding the patents-in-suit not invalid and infringed

BACKGROUND
Pozen developed a method for treating migraines by combining two drugs sumatriptan and naproxen in a single_tablet
Pozen Inc. v. Par Pharm. Inc. 800_F.Supp.2d_789 796 ( E.D.Tex.2011 )
Sumatriptan a 5-HT receptor agonist was developed in the late 1980s and is widely accepted as an effective medicine for migraines but it does not prevent the reoccurrence of migraine symptoms
Id.at 797
Naproxen is a well known nonsteroidal *1157 anti-inflammatory drug ( `` NSAID '' )
Id.at 798
Pozen in partnership with GlaxoSmithKline ( `` GSK '' ) markets a combination of sumatriptan and naproxen called TreximetTHE_R and holds three related patents relevant to this appeal
Id
The ¡¬499_patent claims a method of treating migraines comprising co-timely administration of 5-HT agonists and long-acting NSAIDs
¡¬499_patent col.1 ll.13-17
The ¡¬458_patent is a continuation of the ¡¬499_patent and claims methods and compositions combining 5-HT agonists and long-acting NSAIDs
¡¬458_patent col.1 ll.18-20
The ¡¬183_patent claims a multilayer pharmaceutical tablet with a triptan such as sumatriptan and a NSAID in separate layers that dissolve independently
¡¬ 183 patent col.1 ll.54-57

Pozen filed a New Drug Application ( `` NDA '' ) to market TreximetTHE_R and obtained approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration ( `` FDA '' ) on April_15,_2008
Pozen 800 F.Supp.2d at 798
Pozen listed the patents-in-suit in its NDA as covering TreximetTHE_R
The patents are included in the FDA 's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations ( known as `` the Orange_Book '' ) see 21 U.S.C.¡± 355 ( b ) ( 1 ) indicating they could be infringed by the unlicensed manufacture use or sale of TreximetTHE_R
Pozen 800 F.Supp.2d at 798

Appellants are generic pharmaceutical manufacturers who filed ANDAs with the FDA seeking approval to market generic forms of TreximetTHE_R before the expiration of Pozen 's patents
Id
; see 21 U.S.C.¡± 355 ( b ) ( 2 ) ( j ) ( 2 )
Appellants filed their application certifying that the patents listed in the Orange_Book are `` invalid or will not be infringed '' by the generic_products
21 U.S.C.¡± 355 ( j ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ( vii ) ( IV ) ; Pozen 800 F.Supp.2d at 798-99 ; Such a certification constitutes an artificial act of infringement
35 U.S.C.¡± 271 ( e ) ( 2 ) ; Warner-Lambert Co. v. Apotex Corp. 316_F.3d_1348 1365 ( Fed.Cir.2003 )
Thereafter Pozen filed complaints against Appellants for infringement of claim 15 of the ¡¬499_patent ; claims 11 12 24 26 27 29 and 30 of the ¡¬458_patent ; and claim 2 of the ¡¬183_patent under the Hatch-Waxman Act.2 35 U.S.C.¡± 271 ( e ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ; Pozen 800 F.Supp.2d at 799
