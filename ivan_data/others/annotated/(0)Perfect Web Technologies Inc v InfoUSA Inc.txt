Opinion
LINN Circuit_Judge
Perfect_Web Technologies Inc. ( `` Perfect_Web '' ) appeals a summary_judgment order holding that the asserted claims of its U.S. Patent No._6631,400 ( `` ¡¬400_patent `` ) are invalid
Perfect_Web Techs. Inc. v. InfoUSA Inc. No._07- CV-80286 ( S.D.Fla
Oct._24,_2008 ) ( `` Opinion `` )
Because we agree with the district_court that the asserted claims would have been obvious we affirm

*1326 BACKGROUND
The ¡¬400_patent claims methods of managing bulk_e-mail_distribution to groups of targeted consumers
The ¡¬400_patent 's application was filed on April_13,_2000 at a time when according to the specification the Internet was at an `` early and fervent stage of development ''
¡¬400_patent col.1 ll.25-27
The patent recognizes that `` electronic mail ( email ) is an often used component of the Internet ''
Id
col.1 ll.27-28
In describing `` opt-in bulk_e-mailing services '' the patent explains that distributors access lists of customers who express subject matter preferences for commercial e-mail
Id
col.1 l.56
The patented invention involves comparing the number of successfully delivered e-mail messages in a delivery against a predetermined desired quantity and if the delivery does not reach the desired quantity repeating the process of selecting and e-mailing a group of customers until the desired number of delivered messages has been achieved

Perfect_Web asserted claims 1 2 5 11 12 and 15 against InfoUSA Inc
Independent claim 1 represents the asserted claims : 1
A method for managing bulk_e-mail_distribution comprising the steps : ( A ) matching a target recipient profile with a group of target_recipients ; ( B ) transmitting a set of bulk_e-mails to said target_recipients in said matched group ; ( C ) calculating a quantity of e-mails in said set of bulk_e-mails which have been successfully received by said target_recipients ; and ( D ) if said calculated quantity does not exceed a prescribed minimum_quantity of successfully received e-mails repeating steps ( A ) - ( C ) until said calculated quantity exceeds said prescribed minimum_quantity
Dependent claim 2 adds the step of choosing a subset of the targeted group for e-mail_distribution
Claim 5 also depends from claim 1 and specifies that the list of targeted recipients is an `` opt-in list ''
Claim 11 is an independent apparatus claim to a `` machine readable storage '' with a `` computer program '' that performs the method of claim 1
Claims 12_and_15 depend from claim 11 and mirror claims 2_and_5 respectively

At the district_court the parties filed a joint claim chart and separate memoranda of law addressing claim construction
InfoUSA moved for summary_judgment of invalidity
After conducting a Markman hearing but without issuing a formal claim construction order the district_court convened a summary_judgment hearing
The court then granted InfoUSA 's motion assuming for summary_judgment purposes that Perfect_Web 's claim constructions were correct
Opinion at 1_n._1
It first concluded that claim 1 would have been obvious under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103 because steps ( A ) - ( C ) of the claimed methods appear in the prior art and step ( D ) `` would be obvious to virtually anyone ''
Id.at 7
Moreover the court found that claim 1 was anticipated under 35 U.S.C.¡± 102 ( b ) by a company called the EmailChannel which allegedly performed the claimed method in public before the patent 's critical date
Id.at 15
Additionally the court held that claim 1 did not constitute patentable subject matter under 35 U.S.C.¡± 101 because it was `` merely a series of algorithms ''
Id.at 18
Finally the court concluded that all of the dependent claims were also invalid as obvious anticipated and/or directed to ineligible subject matter

Perfect_Web appealed and we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( 2006 )

*1327 DISCUSSION
`` We review a district_court 's grant of summary_judgment de novo reapplying the standard applicable at the district_court ''
Young v. Lumenis Inc. 492_F.3d_1336 1345 ( Fed.Cir.2007 )
Summary judgment is proper if there is `` no genuine issue as to any material fact '' and `` the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law ''
