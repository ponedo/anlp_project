Synopsis
Background : Assignee filed action against competitors alleging infringement of patent on entertainment_system for use in purchasing and storing songs videos and multimedia_karaoke_information
Competitors asserted inequitable_conduct_defense and also counterclaimed for declaratory_judgment of inequitable_conduct
The United_States_District_Court for the District of Nevada James C. Mahan J. granted competitors ' requested declaratory_judgment of inequitable_conduct held that patent was unenforceable and dismissed action
Plaintiff appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Linn Circuit_Judge held that :

assignee 's motion to present its proofs first was not concession that competitors had met their threshold burden of showing intent to deceive ;

district_court clearly erred in relying on evidence showing at best that inventor and his lawyer knew that prior art was material and inability of inventor and his lawyer to offer good faith explanation as basis to infer deliberate_decision to withhold prior_art_reference ;

decision of district_court to not credit testimony of inventor and his lawyer could not be used as affirmative evidence of selective disclosure ; and

paying issue_fee after prior_art_reference had been brought to their attention was not deliberate_decision to withhold prior_art_reference

Opinion
LINN Circuit_Judge
1st_Media LLC ( `` 1st_Media '' ) is the assignee of U.S._Patent_No._5464,946 ( `` ¡¬946_Patent `` ) and appeals from the United_States_District_Court for the District of Nevada 's dismissal of 1st_Media 's complaint alleging infringement of the ¡¬946_Patent by Electronic_Arts Inc. Harmonix_Music_Systems Inc. Viacom Inc. and Sony_Computer_Entertainment_America LLC ( collectively `` Appellees '' )
1st_Media v. doPi Karaoke Inc. No._07- cv-1589 ( Apr._23,_2010 ) ( `` 1st_Media `` )
The court found that during prosecution of the ¡¬946_Patent the named inventor Dr. Scott Lewis ( `` Lewis '' ) and his attorney Joseph Sawyer ( `` Sawyer '' ) withheld from the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( `` PTO '' ) three material references and information about PTO rejections in two related prosecutions thereby committing inequitable_conduct and rendering the ¡¬946_Patent unenforceable
Because the record contains no evidence of a deliberate_decision to withhold those references from the PTO as required under Therasense Inc. v. Becton Dickinson & Co. 649_F.3d_1276_(Fed.Cir.2011) ( en banc ) and because Appellees admit that the record is complete this court reverses

I
BACKGROUND
The ¡¬946_Patent is titled `` System and Apparatus for Interactive Multimedia Entertainment '' and covers an entertainment_system for use in purchasing and storing songs videos and multimedia_karaoke_information
On Lewis 's behalf Sawyer filed the application that led to the ¡¬946_Patent ( `` ¡¬946_Application '' ) on November 13 1992
On September 14 1994 the examiner rejected all claims of the ¡¬946_Application as anticipated or obvious in view of five prior_art_references
To overcome the rejections Sawyer argued on February 21 1995 that the claimed entertainment *1370 system included a multimedia_call_processing_system an element not found in the cited references
He also amended current claim 16 to limit it to karaoke devices
The examiner responded by issuing a Notice of Allowance on May_2,_1995 ; Sawyer paid the issue_fee on August 1 1995 ; and the PTO issued the ¡¬946_Patent on November 7 1995

While the ¡¬946_Application was pending Sawyer prosecuted a number of other patent applications for related inventions made by Lewis
The applications relevant to this appeal are : ( 1 ) International Patent Application No
PCT/US93/10930 ( `` PCT_Application '' ) ; ( 2 ) U.S. Patent Application No._07 /975,824 which became U.S._Patent_No._5325,423 ( `` ¡¬423_Patent `` ) and ; ( 3 ) U.S. Patent Application No._08 /265,391 which became U.S._Patent_No._5564,001 ( `` ¡¬001_Patent `` )

The PCT_Application as filed on November 11 1993 was identical to the as filed ¡¬946_Application but was never amended to add the karaoke limitation
In a June_25,_1995 supplemental search report a European Patent Office ( `` EPO '' ) examiner cited as prior art International Publication WO 90/01243 ( `` Bush '' ) noting that Bush was a category `` Y '' reference meaning it was particularly relevant if combined with another document of the same category
Sawyer received the supplemental European report citing Bush on July_24,_1995 eight days before he paid the issue_fee for the ¡¬946_Patent
Neither Lewis nor Sawyer ever disclosed the Bush_reference to the PTO and Bush was not considered during the course of examination of the ¡¬946_Application
The EPO ultimately rejected the PCT_Application on November 3 1998 citing Bush as the closest prior art document

Lewis filed the application that led to the ¡¬423_Patent ( `` ¡¬423_Application '' ) on the same day as the ¡¬946_Application
Large portions of the ¡¬ 423 Patent 's specification are identical to the ¡¬946_Patent
Those portions include descriptions of terms Lewis coined- '' interactive multimedia mastering system '' ( `` IMM '' ) a `` multimedia_call_processing_system '' ( `` MCPS '' ) and `` interactive multimedia devices '' ( `` IMD '' )
Compare ¡¬946_Patent col. 4_l._62 -col. 11_l._63 with ¡¬423_Patent col. 6_l._4 -col. 13_l._24
On July_16,_1993 an examiner rejected several claims of the ¡¬423_Application as anticipated by U.S._Patent_No._5027,400 ( `` Baji '' ) which discloses what the examiner considered to be an IMM MCPS and IMD-the same components of the karaoke device covered by claim 16 of the ¡¬946_Patent
On October 29 1993 Sawyer responded to the rejection by cancelling the rejected claims
The ¡¬ 423 Patent issued on June_28,_1994
Neither Lewis nor Sawyer ever disclosed Baji to the PTO and the PTO did not consider the reference during prosecution of the ¡¬946_Patent

On June_24,_1994 Lewis filed the application leading to the ¡¬001_Patent ( `` ¡¬001_Application '' ) as a continuation-in-part of the ¡¬423_Application
On June_12,_1995 an examiner contended that the IMM MCPS and IMD structures to the extent claimed were disclosed in U.S._Patent_No._5220,420 ( `` Hoarty '' ) and rejected independent claim 1 of the ¡¬001_Application as obvious in view of Hoarty
On September 12 1995 Sawyer replaced claim 1 with new claim 40 distinguishing Hoarty while retaining the IMM MCPS and IMD limitations
The ¡¬001_Patent ultimately issued on October 8 1996
Neither Lewis nor Sawyer ever disclosed Hoarty to the PTO and the PTO did not consider the reference during prosecution of the ¡¬946_Patent

On November 29 2007 1st_Media filed a complaint in the United_States_District_Court for the District of Nevada alleging infringement of at least claim 16 of the ¡¬946_Patent
Appellees asserted an inequitable_conduct_defense and also counterclaimed *1371 for declaratory_judgment of inequitable_conduct
The court bifurcated the case focusing initial proceedings on the question of inequitable_conduct
1st_Media moved to put its evidence on first arguing that `` [ c ] ommon sense dictates that a patentee should inform the Court of the background circumstances of patent procurement before an infringer steps in to attack the patentee ''
Pl
's Mot
In Limine # 1 : To Confirm the Normal Order of Proofs at 2 1st_Media ( Aug._21,_2009 ) ECF No._204
Appellees opposed the motion arguing that because they had the burden to prove inequitable_conduct they should present their evidence first
The court agreed with the Appellees and held a bench trial on February 25_and_26 2010 allowing Appellees to begin with a direct_examination of Lewis

At trial Appellees alleged five incidents of inequitable_conduct three based on the failure to cite references and two based on the failure to disclose rejections in the ¡¬423 and ¡¬001_Patent prosecutions that respectively brought to light two of those references
Because the Appellees do not rely on appeal on the non-disclosure of the rejections themselves as a basis for affirming the district_court 's decision we consider those grounds conceded and address only the allegations of inequitable_conduct relating to the three references noted
Appellee 's Br
55_n._18

With respect to the three references both Lewis and Sawyer testified that they did not appreciate the materiality of any of them
Lewis testified under direct_examination by Appellees that nondisclosure of the Bush_reference was `` an oversight that got lost in the cracks at that time and was n't a conscious decision not to report [ it ] ''
Tr
of Inequitable_Conduct_Hr ' g Day One at 183 1st_Media ( Feb._25,_2010 ) ECF No._267 ( `` Day One Tr `` )
Although Sawyer testified that he could not recall why he did not disclose the Bush_reference Appellees pointed to his previous declaration in which he claimed that `` the Bush publication itself never sparked an awareness or belief in my mind that Bush should be disclosed ''
Tr
of Inequitable_Conduct_Hr ' g Day Two at 134 1st_Media ( Feb._26,_2010 ) ECF No._270 ( `` Day Two Tr `` )
Sawyer also testified that he generally considered patentability issues in a case only during what he termed `` active prosecution '' or the time between the first office action and the notice of allowance
Id.at 149
During the time period that Sawyer was prosecuting the ¡¬946_Patent he had newly set up a solo office out of his home and characterized his practice as being at times `` very active ''
Id.at 153 ( Sawyer 's testimony that he was handling about 170 open prosecution files by the end of 1995 )
As for the Baji and Hoarty references Lewis and Sawyer each testified that the technology in the co-pending ¡¬423 and ¡¬001_Applications was so distinct from the ¡¬946_Application that it did not occur to them to disclose Baji or Hoarty during prosecution of the ¡¬946_Patent

The district_court found their explanations not credible
Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law Following Trial on Inequitable Conduct at 4 1st_Media ( Apr._23,_2010 ) ECF No._276 ( `` Findings '' ) ( `` Dr._Lewis and Mr._Sawyer offered explanations for their failure to disclose the material prior art.. that were not credible.. Mr._Sawyer 's explanation like Dr._Lewis '.. was neither factually nor legally sufficient to explain the failure to disclose the Bush Reference which was highly material
`` ) ; id.at 4-5 ( `` As to Baji [ and ] Hoarty.. Dr._Lewis and Mr._Sawyer suggested that they viewed the technology at issue in their co-pending applications as so distinct from that of the ¡¬946 application.. that 'it did not occur to them ' to make any disclosures about Baji [ or ] Hoarty.. That explanation which defied common sense in light of the extensive overlap in *1372 the applications and claims was fully discredited at trial `` )
The district_court found that Lewis and Sawyer knew the references were material and concluded that because they failed to provide a credible good faith explanation for nondisclosure of the references it was appropriate to infer that they intended to deceive the PTO during prosecution of the ¡¬946_Patent
Id
The district_court thus concluded that Lewis and Sawyer committed inequitable_conduct
The court allowed Appellees to draft proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law
The court adopted those findings verbatim granted Appellees ' requested declaratory_judgment of inequitable_conduct held the ¡¬946_Patent unenforceable and dismissed 1st_Media 's complaint
1st_Media appealed and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
