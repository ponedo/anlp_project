Opinion
RADER Circuit_Judge
On December 29 1994 the United_States_District_Court for the Southern_District of Indiana denied Sofamor_Danek_Group Inc. 's ( Sofamor ) motion for a preliminary_injunction against DePuy-Motech Inc. ( DePuy-Motech )
Because Sofamor did not meet its burdens of proof this court affirms

BACKGROUND
Sofamor owns three patents U.S. Patent Nos._4641,636 4,815,453 and 5,005,562 on surgical implant devices to correct deformities or traumas in the human_spine
The patent at issue is U.S. Patent No._5005,562 ( the '562_patent )
Sofamor and DePuy-Motech compete in the spinal implant business
DePuy-Motech introduced a competing product the MOSS-MIAMI spinal implant device in the United States market

Both the invention of the '562_patent and the MOSS-MIAMI_device are used in spinal surgery
This technology essentially implants rigid rods to straighten or support a deformed spine
Both the patented invention and the MOSS-MIAMI_device comprise an anchoring hook implant with an open back into which the surgeon may place the rod
A threaded_plug secures the rod
In the MOSS-MIAMI_device an external nut further secures the threaded_plug

Sofamor filed an action alleging that DePuy-Motech infringed their three spinal implant *1219 patents
Sofamor then moved for a preliminary_injunction on the '562_patent to stop DePuy-Motech from the allegedly infringing activity
DePuy-Motech asserted invalidity and unenforceability defenses as well as patent misuse

Sofamor and DePuy-Motech dispute whether the MOSS-MIAMI_device infringes claim 1 of the '562_patent
The claim states : Implant for an osteosynthesis device in particular of the spine comprising anchorage portion means for anchoring the implant to bone and body attaching means for attaching the implant to a rod said body attaching means having two side_branches defining a channel open at both sides of the body attaching means in order to be able to receive the rod and open to a rear_portion of the body attaching means and a threaded_plug a female_thread formed in inner_walls of said two side_branches at the rear_portion of the body attaching means said threaded_plug being screwed into said female_thread to close the channel at said rear_portion the plug having a face directed towards the rod said facing being equipped with means for gripping and attaching the plug to the rod in a manner in which the rod will be clamped to prevent translation and rotation
Col. 4 11
14-29 ( emphasis added )

In December 1994 the trial_court held a three-day hearing receiving testimony from several witnesses
The court denied Sofamor 's motion for preliminary_injunction
In reaching its decision the trial_court construed the claims of the '562_patent
From the specification prosecution_history and extrinsic evidence the court determined that a device fitting within the meaning of `` body attaching means '' would : 1. use less than three parts to attach the rod to the spine ; 2. have a body attaching means connected to an anchoring device the rear_portion of which has a channel or groove open to the back ; 3. have a body attaching means that is formed by two smooth-sided branches containing threads on their inner_walls into which a single threaded_plug is tightened to close the channel ; and
4. use a plug that is equipped with something that enables it to lock the rod against movement in three different directions
Sofamor_Danek_Group Inc. v. DePuy-Motech Inc. No
IP94-350-C 1994_WL_846541 at *6 ( S.D.Ind
Dec._29,_1994 )

Based on this claim reading the trial_court found that Sofamor did not prove the likelihood of success on patent infringement or validity
Further Sofamor did not offer evidence to support a finding of irreparable_harm
Without a showing on these two prongs the court did not balance hardships on the parties or assess the impact of an injunction on the public interest
Sofamor appeals to this court
