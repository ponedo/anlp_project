Synopsis
Background : Competitor brought action against patentee seeking judgment of invalidity of four patents relating to drug-eluting coronary_stents used in treatment of coronary_artery_disease
Patentee counterclaimed for infringement
The United_States_District_Court for the District of Delaware Sue L. Robinson J. 679_F.Supp.2d_539 granted summary_judgment of invalidity
Patentee appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Moore Circuit_Judge held that :

specification that demonstrated possession of rapamycin in claimed stent did not evidence possession of genus of macrocyclic_lactone_analogs of rapamycin ;

lack of any disclosure of examples of macrocyclic_lactone_analogs of rapamycin and lack of any guidance on how to properly determine whether compound was macrocyclic lactone analog could be considered when determining whether claimed invention included possession of genus of macrocyclic_lactone_analogs ;

article disclosing how rapamycin interacted with FKBP12 and mTOR was not sufficient to establish correlation between structure and function ;

indication in prior art patents that `` structure and mechanism of action of rapamycin were known '' was not sufficient to establish correlation between function and structure of rapamycin and its analogs ;

specification did not disclose to person of ordinary skill in the art that inventors were in possession of macrocyclic triene analogs of rapamycin by meager disclosure of `` analogs '' ; and

claim which required `` from about 64 £gg to about 197 £gg of rapamycin or a macrocyclic triene analog thereof wherein said device provides an in-stent late loss in diameter at 12 months following implantation in a human of less than about 0.5 mm '' did not contain sufficient support for highly specific functional requirements claimed

Johnson & Johnson Inc. ( J & J ) Cordis Corp. ( Cordis ) and Wyeth ( collectively Appellants ) appeal the decision of the United_States_District_Court for the District of Delaware granting summary_judgment that certain claims of U.S. Patent Nos._7217,286 ( the ¡¬7286_patent ) 7,223,286 ( the ¡¬ 3286 patent ) 7,229,473 ( the ¡¬473_patent ) and 7,300,662 ( the ¡¬662_patent ) ( collectively the patents-in-suit ) are invalid for failure to comply with 35 U.S.C.¡± 112 ?

Boston Scientific Corp. v. Johnson & Johnson Inc. 679_F.Supp.2d_539 ( D.Del.2010 )
The district court determined that the asserted claims of the ¡¬7286_patent the ¡¬3286_patent and the ¡¬473_patent ( collectively the 1997 patents ) are invalid for lack of adequate written description and lack of enablement and that the asserted claims of the ¡¬662_patent are invalid for lack of adequate written description
Because no finder of fact could reasonably determine that the asserted claims of the patents-in-suit contained an adequate written description we affirm

BACKGROUND
I. Drug-Eluting Stents
The patents-in-suit relate to drug-eluting coronary_stents used in the treatment of coronary_artery_disease
Coronary artery disease is caused in part by atherosclerosis a build-up of arterial plaque
Atherosclerosis limits the flow of blood and oxygen to the heart and can result in chest pain blood clots heart attacks and other ailments

In 1977 physicians first used a procedure called balloon_angioplasty to reopen arteries closing because of atherosclerosis
During the procedure the physician inserts a balloon catheter into an artery near the patient 's groin and threads the catheter through the artery to the site of the blockage
The physician then inflates the balloon to reopen the narrowed artery
In many balloon_angioplasty patients the opened artery narrows again-a process known as restenosis
One of the key components of restenosis is a phenomenon called neointimal_proliferation wherein the smooth muscle cells of the artery multiply over time in response to injury caused by the inflation of the balloon
The result of neointimal_proliferation is the renarrowing of the artery

In the 1980s physicians began using bare_metal_coronary_stents to support the artery after the physician deflates the balloon
Although these bare_metal_coronary_stents prevented the collapse of the artery and constriction due to scarring restenosis remained a problem because the bare metal stents did not prevent neointimal_proliferation

Researchers turned to a myriad of techniques in an attempt to prevent restenosis following balloon_angioplasty
For example *1357 researchers tested numerous oral drugs for the treatment of restenosis
J.A
14732-39
One of Appellants ' experts characterized the number and variety of drugs tested as `` reflect [ ing ] the lack of any clear path or direction toward a particular drug therapy for restenosis ''
J.A
14732
Researchers also experimented with drug-eluting stents in an effort to prevent restenosis
Researchers believed that the drugs contained on such stents could help prevent neointimal_proliferation
Cordis 's CypherTHE_R stent was the first drug-eluting stent approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and sold in the United States
