BACKGROUND
Luniewski was employed by Shamrock Technologies Inc. ( Shamrock ) between May 1980 and July 1983
As a condition of employment he agreed to assign his work-related inventions to Shamrock
Luniewski and William Neuberg jointly invented an apparatus and method for processing_polytetrafluoroethylene ( PTFE ) with radiation
On March_26,_1982 Luniewski assigned his rights in the inventions to Shamrock
Patent applications were filed on May_3,_1982 and July_22,_1983
Having signed declarations to be filed with the patent applications Luniewski left Shamrock in July 1983 and joined MSI as Vice President in charge of Operations
Thereafter MSI began radiation_processing of PTFE ; first by an `` original process '' and after this suit was commenced by a `` current process ''1

On May_31,_1988 and October 11 1988 respectively the applications issued as United States Patent Nos._4748,005 ( '005 ) ( apparatus ) and 4,777,192 ( '192 ) ( method )
On May_31,_1988 Shamrock sued MSI and Luniewski for infringement of its '005_patent
MSI and Luniewski counterclaimed for a declaration of invalidity
In an October 13 1988 `` Memorandum of Decision and Order '' the district_court applied the doctrine of assignor_estoppel and granted Shamrock 's partial summary_judgment motion to strike affirmative_defenses and to dismiss the counterclaim
The district_court rejected the arguments that the assignment was fraudulently obtained and that privity was lacking between Luniewski and MSI.2

On November 18 1988 Shamrock amended its complaint asserting infringement of the '192_patent

In an August 8 1989 `` Memorandum of Decision and Order '' the district_court rejected a request to withdraw the October 13 1988 order and entered summary_judgment that : ( 1 ) the affirmative_defenses and counterclaim relating to invalidity of the '192_patent were barred by assignor_estoppel ; ( 2 ) the defense of unenforceability of both patents was barred by assignor_estoppel ; and ( 3 ) the accused original and current processes infringed the patents
On August 24 1989 the district_court entered a `` Final Partial Judgment '' pursuant to Rule 54 ( b ) Fed.R.Civ.P.,3 holding the patents not invalid enforceable and infringed *791 and enjoining MSI and Luniewski from further infringement
