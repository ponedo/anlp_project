We reverse

BACKGROUND
In January 2013 VA sued Defendants alleging infringement of U.S. Patent No._8095,413 ( '413_patent )
On May_24,_2013 Salesforce filed a petition with the Patent_Trial and Appeal_Board ( PTAB ) for post-grant review of all claims of the ¡¬413_patent under the CBM_program
In the petition Salesforce argued that all claims of the ¡¬413_patent were eligible for this form of post-grant review because they are directed *1309 to a `` covered business_method patent '' within the meaning of ¡± 18 ( a ) ( 1 ) of the America Invents Act ( AIA ) Pub L. No._112-29 125_Stat._284 329-31 ( 2011 ) and that Salesforce had standing to bring the petition because it was sued for patent infringement AIA_¡± 18 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B )
Salesforce further argued the PTAB should institute CBM_review because all the claims of the ¡¬413_patent were more likely than not patent-ineligible under 35 U.S.C.¡± 101 and invalid under 35 U.S.C.¡±¡± 102 103 in view of several prior art references

On May_29,_2013 Defendants filed a motion to stay district_court_proceedings pursuant to AIA_¡± 18 ( b ) ( 1 )
See Defendants ' Joint Motion To Stay Proceedings Virtual-Agility Inc. v. Salesforce.com Inc. 13-cv-00111 ( E.D.Tex
May_29,_2013 ) ECF No._67
In August 2013 while this motion was pending the district_court issued a discovery order and held a scheduling conference setting an April 2014 date for a claim construction hearing and a November 2014 date for jury selection
Also in August 2013 VA filed a Preliminary Response in opposition to Salesforce 's petition at the PTAB pursuant to 37 C.F.R.¡± 42.207 ( a )
In November 2013 the PTAB granted-in-part Salesforce 's petition based on its conclusion that all claims of the ¡¬413_patent are directed to a covered business_method and are more likely than not patent-ineligible under 35 U.S.C.¡± 101 and invalid under ¡± 102 as anticipated by U.S. Patent No._5761,674 ( Ito )
The PTAB also issued its own scheduling order setting a July 2014 date for a trial on the validity of the ¡¬413_patent claims

In early January 2014 the district_court denied Defendants ' motion to stay the case pending CBM_review
VirtualAgility_Inc. v. Salesforce.com Inc. 13-cv-00111 2014_WL_94371 ( E.D.Tex
Jan. 9 2014 )
Defendants timely filed an interlocutory appeal to this court and also filed motions to stay district_court_proceedings pending the disposition of this appeal with the district_court and this court
While these motions were pending VA filed a Motion to Amend the ¡¬413_patent claims with the PTAB contingent on the claims ' invalidation
PTAB No
