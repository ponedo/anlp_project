ZENITH LABORATORIES INC. Plaintiff-Appellant v. BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY Defendant-Appellee
No._92-1527
| March_24,_1994
| Rehearing Denied ; Suggestion for Rehearing In Banc Declined May_26,_1994
Synopsis
Seller of antibiotic that allegedly converted into infringing crystal after ingested by patient brought declaratory judgment suit against owner of patent for antibiotic crystal developed to assist in preingestation encapsulation
The United States District_Court for the District of New_Jersey Alfred M. Wolin J. ruled that seller_induced_infringement following bench_trial
Appeal was taken
The Court of Appeals Plager Circuit_Judge held that : ( 1 ) prosecution history did not limit patent claim to drug 's preingested form ; ( 2 ) absence of evidence comparing alleged infringing drug after ingestation with patented drug precluded finding that seller_induced_infringement ; and ( 3 ) doctrine of equivalents did not apply as matter of law

Opinion
PLAGER Circuit_Judge
The question in this declaratory_judgment_action is whether a drug compound which in its manufactured state does not infringe the patent in suit becomes infringing as a result of transitory chemical changes that occur in vivo that is as a result of ingestion by the patient
There are fact issues-what changes actually occur when the drug is ingested and how do we know ; there are legal issues-does a compound that changes in the human body into the patented product on its way to becoming the active_ingredient in the drug ( the original patent on the active_ingredient having earlier expired ) literally infringe infringe under the doctrine of equivalents or infringe by inducement

The District_Court for the District of New_Jersey Civil Action No._91-3423 entered judgment following a bench_trial that plaintiff/appellant Zenith_Laboratories Inc. 's ( Zenith ) commercial_sale of cefadroxil_DC induces infringement of U.S. Patent 4,504,657 ( the '657_patent )1 the patent at issue
Zenith_Lab Inc. v. Bristol-Myers_Squibb_Co. 24_USPQ2d_1652 1992_WL_340761_(D.N.J.1992) ( Zenith II )
The '657_patent is owned by Bristol-Myers_Squibb_Co. ( Bristol )
For the reasons set forth we reverse

BACKGROUND
The chemical compound cefadroxil an antibiotic of the cephalosporin family effective against bacteria that are resistant to penicillin was described and claimed in United States Patent No._3489,752 ( the '752_patent ) which issued in 1970 ; the owner was Bristol
The claims of the '752_patent covered any and all forms of cefadroxil-they described the chemical compound per se
The '752_patent expired in 1987

In the meantime Bristol set to work to find a commercially useful crystalline form of the compound that would overcome problems related to manufacture of the product so that it would be usable by humans
The task of developing a commercial production process was assigned to certain of Bristol 's chemists
They developed what became known as the Bouzard_monohydrate named after one of the discoverers-a new crystalline form of cefadroxil
Unlike prior forms of cefadroxil Bouzard_monohydrate possesses certain characteristics in its pre-ingested powdered form related to bulk density solubility and stability ( manufacturing-related characteristics ) which make it particularly suitable for packaging into capsules

*1420 The Bouzard_monohydrate was the subject of the single claim in the '657_patent : 1
Crystalline 7- [ D -- amino -- ( p-hydroxyphenyl- ) acetamido ] -3-methyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid monohydrate exhibiting essentially the following x-ray diffraction properties : [ a 37-line table of relative intensities exhibited by Bouzard_monohydrate at various scan angles ]

In July 1988 Zenith the plaintiff in this declaratory_judgment_action contracted with a Spanish company Gema S.A. of Barcelona ( Gema ) to become the exclusive United States distributor of the form of cefadroxil manufactured by Gema and known as cefadroxil_DC
Cefadroxil DC is a hemihydrate form of cefadroxil and thus differs structurally from Bouzard_monohydrate.2 Zenith and Gema then undertook to obtain approval from the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) for commercial marketing in the United States of cefadroxil_DC
Pursuant to FDA regulations Zenith and Gema sought abbreviated approval on the grounds that cefadroxil_DC was bioequivalent to a form of cefadroxil monohydrate ( other than Bouzard_monohydrate ) which had already been approved by the FDA for commercial_sale
In October 1990 the FDA granted approval.3

In June 1991 after learning of Zenith 's and Gema 's efforts to obtain FDA approval Bristol filed suit against Gema ( and Gema 's affiliates ) in the District_Court for the District of Maryland Civil Action No
HAR 91-1765 ( the Maryland_action ) alleging infringement of the '657_patent
Subsequently when Gema announced it was abandoning its plans to manufacture cefadroxil_DC that suit was dismissed upon stipulation of the parties

Zenith then in August 1991 filed the present declaratory_judgment_action against Bristol in the District_Court for the District of New_Jersey
Zenith 's complaint contained four counts
In count one Zenith sought a declaration that cefadroxil_DC does not infringe the '657_patent and in count two a declaration that Bristol is equitably estopped from asserting that cefadroxil_DC infringes the '657_patent
In count three Zenith alleged that Bristol by initiating the Maryland_action violated a consent decree previously entered in settlement of prior litigation between the parties ; and in count four that Bristol had engaged in unfair competition
( Zenith subsequently added a fifth and still pending count alleging that Bristol had committed antitrust violations )

Bristol then moved to dismiss counts one and two and for summary_judgment on counts three and four
Zenith filed cross-motions for summary_judgment on these counts
On December 12 1991 the trial_court granted Bristol 's motion to dismiss count three ( concerning the prior consent decree ) on the ground that the count was moot in view of the previous dismissal of the Maryland_action
Zenith_Lab Inc. v. Bristol-Myers_Squibb_Co. 24_USPQ2d_1641 1651 1991_WL_267892_(D.N.J.1991) ( Zenith I )
As to Zenith 's motion for summary_judgment on count one ( the infringement_count ) the court stayed that motion pending an oral hearing
Id.at 1648
The court denied all other motions
Id.at 1648 1650-51

At the hearing on the infringement_count Bristol conceded that cefadroxil_DC being a hemihydrate did not literally infringe the '657_patent in its pre-ingested form
Bristol nevertheless argued that Zenith was liable under the patent on two grounds : Zenith 's product infringed under the doctrine of equivalents ; and Zenith 's product converted into the patented compound in the patient 's stomach and thus the sale of cefadroxil_DC would induce infringement of the '657_patent under 35 U.S.C.¡± 271 ( b ) ( 1988 )
The trial_court concluded that summary_judgment was appropriate since Bristol had not raised a genuine factual dispute on these issues ; and on March_4,_1992 the court granted Zenith 's motion for summary_judgment on count one

*1421 However subsequently on April_16,_1992 upon Bristol 's motion for reconsideration the court vacated its March_4,_1992 decision
The court denied Zenith 's motion for summary_judgment on count one on the basis that Bristol through two declarations submitted with its motion for reconsideration had demonstrated a genuine dispute on the in vivo conversion issue
Consequently it ordered that that count be severed from the remaining counts and tried separately

From May_26,_1992 through June_5,_1992 the court conducted a bench_trial on count one
Following the trial the court rejected Bristol 's theory of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
It found that Bristol through prosecution history estoppel had relinquished coverage of cefadroxil_DC
However the court found that cefadroxil_DC converts to Bouzard_monohydrate in the patient 's stomach
Since an act of literal infringement thus occurs in the patient 's stomach as a result of ingestion of cefadroxil_DC the court concluded that Zenith 's sale of cefadroxil_DC would induce infringement of the '657_patent

On August 6 1992 the court in accordance with its findings and conclusions entered judgment for Bristol
Zenith II 24_USPQ2d_1652
The court pursuant to 35 U.S.C.¡± 271 ( e ) ( 4 ) ( A ) ( 1988 ) ordered that the effective date of any approval by the FDA of cefadroxil_DC for commercial distribution and sale by Zenith could be no earlier than March_12,_2002 the expiration date of the '657_patent
Id.at 1676
It subsequently certified the finality of that judgment pursuant to Rule 54 ( b ) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
Zenith then filed this appeal
