LINN Circuit_Judge
Bridgeport_Fittings Inc. ( `` Bridgeport '' ) appeals from the entry of judgment in favor of Arlington_Industries Inc. ( `` Arlington '' ) after a jury trial on Arlington 's suit for infringement of its United States Patent No._5736,674 ( `` ¡¬674_patent `` )
Arlington_Indus. Inc. v. Bridgeport_Fittings Inc. No._3 : 99_CV_1857_(M.D._Pa._June_25,_2002)
Bridgeport also appeals from the entry of an amended permanent_injunction
Arlington_Indus. Inc. v. Bridgeport_Fittings Inc. No._3 :99-CV-1857 ( M.D.Pa
July_24,_2002 )
Bridgeport argues that the district court erroneously construed three claim limitations and that these errors rendered the court 's jury_instructions prejudicially erroneous
Because in each of the constructions it advances on appeal Bridgeport improperly seeks to import limitations from the specification into the claims and otherwise fails to persuade the court that the jury_instructions contained prejudicial error we affirm both the judgment and the amended permanent_injunction
