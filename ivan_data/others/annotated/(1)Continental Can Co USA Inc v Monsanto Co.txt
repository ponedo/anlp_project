Summary Judgment
An issue may be decided on motion for summary_judgment when there is no genuine_issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law

56 ( c ) ; Anderson v. Liberty Lobby Inc. 477_U.S._242 106_S.Ct._2505 91_L.Ed.2d_202_(1986) ; Celotex Corp. v. Catrett 477_U.S._317 325-26 106_S.Ct._2548 2554 91_L.Ed.2d_265_(1986) ; Scripps Clinic & Research Foundation v. Genentech Inc. 927_F.2d_1565 1571 18_U.S.P.Q.2d_1001 1005 ( Fed.Cir.1991 )
The movant 's burden is to show that no fact material to the issue is in dispute that even if all material factual inferences are drawn in favor of the non-movant the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law
Id
Summary judgment is as available in patent cases as in other areas of litigation

( Fed.Cir.1983 )

The purpose of the summary process is to avoid a clearly unnecessary trial Matsushita Elec Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp. 475_U.S._574 587 106_S.Ct._1348 1356 89_L.Ed.2d_538_(1986) ; it is not designed to substitute lawyers ' advocacy for evidence or affidavits for examination before the fact-finder when there is a genuine_issue for trial
As stated in Adickes v. S.H
Kress & Co. 398_U.S._144 176 90_S.Ct._1598 1618 26_L.Ed.2d_142_(1970) ( Black J. concurring ) `` [ t ] he right to confront cross-examine and impeach adverse witnesses is one of the most fundamental rights sought to be preserved by the Seventh Amendment ''

While facilitating the disposition of legally meritless suits when summary_judgment *1266 is improvidently granted the effect is to prolong litigation and increase its burdens
This is of particular concern in patent disputes where the patent property is a wasting asset and justice is ill served by delay in final resolution
In the case at bar although some issues could be resolved on the law and undisputed facts other issues require trial
