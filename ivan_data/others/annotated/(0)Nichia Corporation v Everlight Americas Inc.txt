| 2016-1618
| Decided : April_28,_2017
Synopsis
Background : Patentee brought action against competitor alleging infringement of patents that disclosed package designs and methods of manufacturing light-emitting diode ( LED ) devices
The United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Texas No._2 :13-cv-00702-JRG J. Rodney Gilstrap 2014_WL_7149169 construed the claims and ruled that patents were infringed after bench_trial but denied patentee 's request for permanent_injunction 2016_WL_310142
Parties appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Stoll Circuit_Judge held that :

term `` lead '' meant portion of device that conducted electricity ;

term `` planar '' meant in substantially same_plane ;

accused product with outer side surfaces of LED packages that had slight concavities infringed `` planar '' limitation in patent directed to process for manufacturing LEDs that improved production_efficiency that required leads to be in substantially same_plane as outer surface of resin ;

patent directed to process for manufacturing LEDs that improved production_efficiency was not obvious ;

accused product met requirement in patent that its positive and negative lead electrodes were `` partially disposed '' on bottom surface of recess and thus infringed ;

patent on LED design that minimized structural problems caused by components expanding and contracting at different rates during thermal cycling was not obvious ;

patent directed to design that sought to prevent adhesive from overflowing into other areas of device was not obvious ; and

patentee would not suffer irreparable harm absent permanent_injunction and thus district_court did not abuse its discretion in denying it

Opinion
Stoll Circuit_Judge
Nichia Corporation sued Everlight_Electronics_Co. LTD. Everlight Americas INC. and Zenaro_Lighting Inc. ( collectively `` Everlight '' ) for infringement of three of its patents
Following a bench_trial the district_court found Everlight infringed all three patents and had not proved them invalid
The court denied however Nichia 's request for a permanent_injunction against Everlight
Nichia appeals the district_court 's refusal to enter an injunction against Everlight
Everlight cross-appeals the court 's judgment that it infringes Nichia 's patents and that it failed to prove the patents invalid
We affirm
