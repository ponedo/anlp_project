CLEVENGER Circuit_Judge
K-2 Corporation appeals the summary_judgment of noninfringement granted in favor of Salomon_S.A. and Salomon/North_America Inc. by the United_States_District_Court for the Western_District of Washington
See K-2 Corp. v. Salomon_S.A. 1998_WL_1032110 50_USPQ2d_1054_(W.D.Wash.1998)
The district_court after construing the disputed claim terms in K-2 's reexamined United States Patent No._5437,466 determined that no reasonable jury could find that the accused product-Salomon 's model `` TR '' in-line skate-infringed the asserted patent either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents
See id.at 1057
Because we conclude that the district_court correctly interpreted the relevant claim language and properly determined that the doctrine of equivalents could not be used to reach the accused device we affirm

I
A. K-2 Corporation ( `` K-2 '' ) is the owner of reexamined U.S. Patent No._5437,466 ( `` the '466_patent `` ) issued August 1 1995 entitled `` In-Line Roller Skate ''
The '466_patent is generally directed to an in-line skate that has a soft pliable inner `` bootie '' or `` shoe '' surrounded in certain areas by molded plastic or straps affixed to the base of the skate
This arrangement allows the wearer 's foot to breathe and offers a substantially lighter skate while retaining structural stiffness required for performance

Figure 1 '466_Patent
Claims 1 5 and 6 of the '466_patent are the only claims at issue in this case
Representative claim 1 recites five major claimed components as set forth in brief form below with the key_limitation underlined : 1
In an in-line_roller skate having an upper shoe portion and a lower frame portion.. a non-rigid shoe portion adapted to receive and substantially enclose the entire foot of the skater.. support means positioned adjacent selected areas of said non-rigid shoe portion for providing support to aid the skater in maintaining said in-line_roller skate in a substantially vertical position.. and a base_portion.. said non-rigid shoe portion being permanently affixed to said base_portion at least at said toe_area and said heel_area for substantially preventing movement_therebetween at least in a horizontal_plane wherein at least a portion of said non-rigid shoe portion extends continuously from said base_portion to at least the top of said ankle support cuff

Claims 5_and_6 contain what the parties agree is equivalent language with respect to the key_limitation : 5
... said non-rigid shoe portion being permanently interconnected with said base_portion at least at said toe_area and said heel_area for substantially *1361 preventing movement_therebetween at least in a horizontal_plane.. 6
... said non- [ rigid ] upper portion being non-removably affixed to said rigid base adjacent both said heel and toe portions of said base for substantially preventing movement_therebetween at least in a horizontal_plane..

Salomon_S.A. and Salomon North_America ( collectively `` Salomon '' ) make and sell an in-line skate designated as model TR that includes a soft inner bootie surrounded by a rigid plastic structure ( `` the TR skate '' )
The TR skate 's inner bootie is fastened to the lower rigid portion of the skate by the use of rivets and a screw in the toe_area and by a removable hex-head screw in the heel_area
The parties agree that the dispositive issue in this case is whether the use of a removable screw in the heel_area of the TR skate can meet the `` permanently affixed '' limitation found in claims 1 5 and 6 of the '466_patent
