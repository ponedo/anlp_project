Patentee appealed

BACKGROUND
Flex-Rest owns the '489 and '231_patent s which relate to computer keyboard positioning systems
The '489_patent involves a clamping system that allows adjustment of the keyboard to a negative_tilt_position with the palm rest adjusted above the plane of the keys
The '231_patent involves a tray system that positions the keyboard in a similar negative_tilt_position
A view of this system is shown in Figure 7 of the '489_patent reproduced below :

*BIG_TOKEN__1355_Fig._7__BIG_TOKEN
?
On April_17,_2002 Flex-Rest filed suit against Steelcase Office_Details Inc. and Office_Concepts Inc. asserting infringement of both patents
Steelcase stipulated that it was liable for Office_Details and the case was bifurcated against Office_Concepts
The claims against Office_Details and Office_Concepts were therefore dismissed and the case proceeded against Steelcase alone

The claim terms at issue in this appeal were construed in a Memorandum Opinion and Order of November 10 2003 following a hearing on claim_construction
At issue in the '489_patent was a limitation related to keyboard position as highlighted in claim 1 below : 1
A device for mounting a keyboard to a base and for positioning the keyboard in a backward_tilted_position.. the device comprises :

* * * ( b ) a clamp engaged with said bracket said clamp being engagable with a keyboard such that the keyboard may be oriented in a backward_tilted_position defined by the rear end of the keyboard being disposed below the front end of the keyboard to prevent the keyboard from falling off when the keyboard is orientated in said backward_tilted_position ;.. '489_patent col._4,_ll._41-54
The district_court construed this language to mean that `` the support device permits the bottom of a keyboard to be tilted backward ( i.e. at any angle of less than 0 degrees ) ''
At issue in the '231_patent was the `` sidewall '' limitation highlighted in claim 1 below : 1
A device for mounting a keyboard to a base and for positioning the keyboard in a backward_tilted_position.. the device comprising :

* * * ( c ) a support_tray comprising : a support_surface and
a keyboard stop member comprising a stop wall said support_surface comprising a front portion a rear_portion a first sidewall and a second sidewall such that said stop wall extends from said first side wall to said second side wall and wherein said stop wall is disposed in said rear_portion of said support_surface.. '231_patent col._9,_ll._38-54
The district_court construed `` sidewall '' to mean `` a structure projecting or extending upward i.e. above the plane of the support_surface from either side of the support_tray ''
Finding that Steelcase 's products did not possess sidewalls that projected or extended upward the district_court granted Steelcase 's motion for partial summary judgment of non-infringement of the '231_patent

After a hearing on various pretrial motions the district_court granted Steelcase 's *1356 motion in limine to exclude certain portions of testimony by Dr. John C. Rosecrance Flex-Rest 's designated expert
Specifically Dr._Rosecrance was allowed to testify to his field of expertise ergonomics but was precluded from testifying as an expert regarding designs of keyboard support systems and the prior_art at the time of the invention

As trial began on the '489_patent Steelcase stipulated that its accused devices infringed
In turn Flex-Rest stipulated that Steelcase 's KBS_device was conceived and reduced to practice before Flex-Rest 's invention was conceived in November 1990 and that the KBS_device taught each limitation of the asserted claims
Thus the primary issue for trial was whether the KBS_device anticipated the '489_patent under 35 U.S.C.¡± 102 ( g ) or qualified as prior_art for obviousness purposes

With respect to the KBS_device Flex-Rest requested that the jury be instructed that in order to constitute prior_art under section 102 ( g ) the prior inventor could not have suppressed or concealed the invention
The district_court found that there was not sufficient evidence to support such an instruction and denied Flex-Rest 's request

During deliberations the jury requested clarification regarding what is considered `` public '' and `` prior_art ''
The district_court defined `` public '' as `` information not restricted by confidentiality ''
As to `` prior_art '' the court responded : In answer to your question anything made or built in the United States by another person before the date of the claimed invention can be prior_art for purposes of 'obviousness ' even if it is not publically [ sic ] available before the date of the claimed invention.. Keep in mind that you should consider what I have just written together with all the other instructions that I gave you earlier
All the instructions are important and you should consider them as a whole
The jury returned a verdict for Steelcase finding the '489_patent invalid under both 35 U.S.C.¡± 102 ( g ) and 35 U.S.C.¡± 103
Flex-Rest did not make a motion for judgment as a matter of law ( JMOL ) or move for a new trial

After entering judgment for Steelcase the district_court considered Steelcase 's motion for a determination of inequitable_conduct in procuring the '489_patent
Steelcase argued that Flex-Rest received-but failed to disclose to the U.S. Patent and Trademark_Office ( the Patent_Office ) -a letter and photographs from a competitor that constituted prior_art material to patentability
Steelcase also argued that Flex-Rest failed to disclose the KBS_device to the Patent_Office and that Flex-Rest 's patent_counsel made a false declaration in his petition to make special because he did not investigate the photographs or the KBS_device in his search of the prior_art
The court concluded that Steelcase failed to show clear and convincing_evidence of an intent to deceive and therefore denied the motion

On appeal Flex-Rest challenges the district_court 's jury instructions the court 's ruling limiting Dr._Rosecrance 's expert testimony and the court 's claim_construction of disputed terms in the '489 and '231_patent s. On cross-appeal Steelcase challenges the district_court 's finding that clear and convincing_evidence did not demonstrate inequitable_conduct in procuring the '489_patent
We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
