United States Court of Appeals Federal Circuit
The SAUNDERS GROUP INC. Plaintiff-Appellant v. COMFORTRAC INC. and Care Rehab and Orthopaedic Products Inc. Defendants-Appellees
No._2006-1576
| June_27,_2007
Synopsis
Background : Patent_holder brought action against competitor alleging infringement of patent directed toward relatively inexpensive and lightweight cervical traction device
The United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Virginia Leonie M. Brinkema J. granted summary_judgment of non-infringement
Patent_holder appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Bryson Circuit_Judge held that :

term `` pneumatic_cylinder '' encompassed cylinders that did not use pressure activated seals ;

claim differentiation doctrine supported inference that independent claim encompassed cylinders without pressure activated seals ;

specification did not support narrowing construction that pressure activated seal was essential component of patent ;

prosecution_history of parent_patent that distinguished prior_art based on presence or absence of pressure activated seal was inapplicable to patent in suit ;

statements in prosecution_history about traction_force that applied to both parent_patent and patent in suit did not establish that cylinder in patent in suit had to contain pressure activated seal ;

statements in prosecution_history arguing only that particular seal disclosed in prior_art would not be feasible for use in patent because it did not maintain required traction_force did not demonstrate relationship between maintaining traction_force and presence of pressure activated seals ; and

inclusion of `` pressure activated seal '' limitation in some claims in patent in suit and its omission from others was sufficiently powerful indicator as to proper construction of asserted claims that it outweighed portions of specification in which invention was described narrowly

Reversed and remanded

Opinion
BRYSON Circuit_Judge
The Saunders Group Inc. brought this patent infringement action in the United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Virginia Docket No._1 :05cv69
Saunders alleged that the defendants are liable for infringement of U.S._Patent_No._6899,690 ( `` the ¡¬690_patent `` )
The district_court granted summary_judgment of noninfringement on the ground that the asserted independent_claims of the ¡¬690_patent require as one of the limitations of each of those claims the presence of at least one pressure activated seal a limitation that is not found in the accused devices
*1329 Saunders now appeals
We hold that the district_court 's claim_construction was erroneous and we therefore reverse the grant of summary_judgment and remand for further proceedings

I. Saunders competes with the defendants in the market for relatively inexpensive and lightweight cervical traction devices
Cervical traction is a physical therapy treatment in which a device is used to generate a sustained force pulling upward on the patient 's neck so as to relieve pressure on enflamed or enlarged nerves
The devices at issue in this case allow patients to treat themselves at home

Both asserted independent_claims of the ¡¬690_patent claims 1_and_16 are directed to a portable cervical traction device
For purposes of this appeal those claims are identical
Claim 1 reads as follows : A cervical traction device comprising : [ 1 ] a support_structure having a track ; [ 2 ] a carriage having a slide bracket slidable along a portion of the track ; [ 3 ] a restraining mechanism adapted to releasably restrain a portion of a patient 's body to the carriage ; [ 4 ] a pneumatic_cylinder having a first end and a moveable piston rod at a second end one of the pneumatic_cylinder or the piston rod attached to the support_structure and the other attached to the carriage the pneumatic_cylinder adapted to move the carriage along the track relative to the support_structure when in a pressurized state the pneumatic_cylinder maintaining a generally static_traction_force for a period in excess of 10 minutes when in the pressurized state without additional pressurized air being supplied ; and
[ 5 ] a hand_pump fluidly connected to the pneumatic_cylinder and adapted to inject pressurized air into the pneumatic_cylinder the hand_pump having a handle moveable relative to a body portion to injecting at least 138 kPa ( 20 psi ) of pressure into the pneumatic_cylinder
Claim 16 is identical to claim 1 except that in the fourth limitation it recites `` during a treatment period '' in place of `` for a period in excess of 10 minutes ''

According to the ¡¬690_patent portable traction devices that were available at the time of the invention were unsatisfactory because of shortcomings in the methods by which the devices produced the traction_force
Pneumatic cylinders with low pressure inputs could not maintain the required force for the requisite amount of time and hydraulic cylinders were not sufficiently portable
¡¬690_patent col._1,_ll._35-43

The ¡¬690_patent is the product of the third in a sequence of related applications
The first application U.S. Ser
No._08 /334,189 ( `` the ¡¬189_application '' ) was directed to a `` portable traction device powered by a pneumatic_cylinder ''
That application did not issue as a patent
The second application which eventually matured into U.S._Patent_No._6506,174 ( `` the ¡¬ 174 patent '' ) and which has the same specification as the ¡¬690_patent was a continuation in part of the ¡¬189_application
The ¡¬174_patent contains claims to lumbar traction systems ; it issued after two rejections and an appeal to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences
All the claims in the ¡¬174_patent explicitly require a pneumatic_cylinder having at least one pressure activated seal
The pneumatic_cylinder portion of *BIG_TOKEN__1330_claim_1__BIG_TOKEN of the ¡¬174_patent is representative and reads as follows with the `` pressure activated seal '' limitation emphasized : a pneumatic traction_force generating apparatus comprising a pneumatic_cylinder attachable to the support_structure adapted to move the carriage relative to the support_structure when the pneumatic_cylinder is in a pressurized state the pneumatic_cylinder having at least one pressure activated seal extending circumferentially around a piston the pressure activated seal movable between a relaxed position and an extended position so the pressure activated seal engages an internal surface on the pneumatic_cylinder when the pneumatic_cylinder is in the pressurized state the pneumatic_cylinder maintaining a static_traction_force for a period in excess of 10 minutes when in the pressurized state without additional pressurized air being supplied

The application that led to the issuance of the ¡¬690_patent was a continuation of the application that led to the ¡¬174_patent
It claimed a cervical traction system instead of a lumbar traction system and it omitted any reference to a `` pressure activated seal '' in two of the independent_claims ( claims 1_and_16 ) and in most of their dependent claims
The `` pressure activated seal '' limitation was explicitly included in two other independent_claims ( claims 14_and_15 ) and in two of the claims that depended from claim 1 ( claims 6_and_7 )
In connection with that application the inventors filed a Petition to Make Special in which they alleged that there was a device on the market that infringed certain specified claims of the application
In that petition Saunders referred to one of the cervical traction devices at issue in this case
Although the petition did not specifically discuss pressure activated seals the only claims alleged to be infringed were those that did not contain an explicit limitation directed to pressure activated seals
The Patent and Trademark Office granted the petition and conducted an expedited examination
The ¡¬690_patent was issued after the patentees overcame various rejections
Saunders filed the present infringement action 10 days later

In a combined claim_construction and summary_judgment opinion the district_court held that the term `` pneumatic_cylinder '' in claim 1 is limited to pneumatic_cylinders containing at least one pressure activated seal
The court noted that the specification `` only disclosed one embodiment for the internal workings of the claimed pneumatic_cylinder '' and that the specification `` teaches no alternative means by which the pneumatic_cylinder can maintain the required traction_force ''
The court also ruled that the prosecution_history of the ¡¬ 174 patent contained an unequivocal disclaimer of O-ring type seals in particular and any seal other than a pressure activated seal in general
Because Saunders admitted that the accused devices do not use pressure activated seals the court granted summary_judgment of noninfringement
