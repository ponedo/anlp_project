The district_court further found the '329_patent to be enforceable and the '329_patent claims 23_and_37 constructively infringed by Teva 's Abbreviated New Drug Application ( `` ANDA '' ) under 35 U.S.C.¡± 271 ( e ) ( 2 ) ( A ) of the Hatch-Waxman Act

We disagree with the district_court 's construction of the claim term `` about '' in claims 23_and_37 of the '329_patent
Because we further hold claims 23_and_37 obvious in light of the prior art we vacate the judgment of the district_court and hold the claims invalid and not infringed

BACKGROUND
A. '329_Patent
Merck owns the '329_patent
The '329_patent entitled `` Method for Inhibiting Bone Resorption '' teaches a method of treating and preventing osteoporosis through less-than-daily administration of bisphosphonate compounds
'329_patent col._1,_ll._15-25
The patent was filed on August 14 1998 and Merck stipulated at trial that it would not allege an invention date prior to July_22,_1997 for the claims at issue
Merck 288 F.Supp.2d at 606

Bisphosphonates are a family of chemical compounds that are known to selectively inhibit the bone destruction process that contributes to osteoporosis and other bone diseases
'329_patent col._1,_ll._45-50
Bisphosphonates include among other compounds alendronate risedronate tiludronate pamidronate ibandronate zolendronate and etidronate
Id.at_col._1,_ll._54-65 ; col._2,_ll._28-31
At issue in this case are once-weekly dosages of alendronate_monosodium_trihydrate

Bisphosphonates are not readily absorbed by the gastrointestinal ( `` GI '' ) tract
The medications thus require rigorous_dosing_instructions : a patient must take the medicine on an empty stomach and remain upright and fasting for thirty minutes after ingestion
'329_patent col._2,_ll._3-24
In addition the compounds are known to have adverse GI side effects that physicians believed to be related in part to ( a ) irritation to the patient 's esophagus or ( b ) the size of the dose
Id.at col._2,_ll._23-46

Before the '329_patent issued standard osteoporosis treatments consisted of small daily doses of bisphosphonates to avoid GI complications
Id.at_col._1,_ll._54-61 ; col._2,_ll._34-35 44-46
According to the patent however the adverse GI side-effects resulting from repetitive irritation to the GI tract were the primary concern in the field
Id.at col._2,_ll._65-67 ; col._3,_l._57- col._4,_l._13
The inventors trumpeted the reduced-frequency dosing schedule disclosed in the '329_patent as decreasing the irritating effect of the compounds as well as increasing patient compliance with the rigorous_dosing_instructions
Id.at col._3,_ll._57-64 ; col._4,_ll._14-23

This case involves dependent claims 23_and_37 of the '329_patent
At trial the parties agreed to cast the text of these claims in independent form incorporating all the dependent limitations : 23
A method for treating osteoporosis in human_comprising orally administering about 70 mg of alendronate_monosodium_trihydrate on an alendronic_acid_basis as a unit_dosage according to a continuous_schedule having a dosing_interval of once-weekly
*1367 37
A method for preventing osteoporosis in human_comprising orally administering about 35 mg of alendronate_monosodium_trihydrate on an alendronic_acid_basis as a unit_dosage according to a continuous_schedule having a dosing_interval of once-weekly
'329_patent col._21,_ll._24-27 ( claim 23 ) ( emphasis added ) ; col._22,_ll._24-26 ( claim 37 ) ( emphasis added )
We note that the only differences between claim 23 and claim 37 are ( 1 ) the dosage amount of alendronate_monosodium_trihydrate ( 70 mg or 35 mg ) and ( 2 ) whether the method is directed to treating or preventing osteoporosis

Merck has Food and Drug Administration ( `` FDA '' ) approval to market both a once-weekly and a relatively diminished daily dose of alendronate_monosodium_trihydrate which it does under the trade name Fosamax
