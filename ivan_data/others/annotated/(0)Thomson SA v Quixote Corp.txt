Opinion
RICH Circuit_Judge
Thomson S.A. ( `` Thomson '' ) appeals from the June_24,_1997 order of the United_States_District_Court for the District of Delaware in an action for patent_infringement
See Thomson S.A. v. Quixote_Corp. 979_F.Supp._286 ( D.Del.1997 ) ( `` Thomson I '' )
The court denied Thomson 's motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law or in the alternative for a new_trial and sustained the jury verdict that U.S. Patent Nos._4868,808 5,182,743 4,961,183 and 5,175,725 are invalid for lack of novelty under 35 U.S.C.¡± 102 ( g )
We affirm

BACKGROUND
Plaintiff-Appellant Thomson is the assignee of the patents in suit which are directed to optical information-storage devices such as compact discs ( `` CDs '' )
Thomson makes and markets machines that `` read '' or `` play '' CDs and grants licenses under the patents in suit to companies which produce CDs
Defendants-Appellees Quixote_Corp. and Disc_Manufacturing Inc. ( collectively `` Quixote '' ) make CDs.1

Thomson sued Quixote for patent_infringement
The parties agreed to base the outcome of the trial on three representative_claims : claims 1_and_13 of U.S. Patent No._4868,808 and claim 1 of U.S. Patent No._5182,743
Before the full trial the district *1174 court conducted a Markman_hearing and issued a written opinion construing the representative_claims

At trial the parties stipulated that Thomson 's invention date for the patents in suit is August 25 1972
Quixote 's defense included evidence purporting to show that the representative_claims are anticipated by an unpatented_laser_videodisc developed before August 1972 by a non-party MCA Discovision Inc. ( `` MCA '' )
After trial the jury found in special verdicts that all of the representative_claims were literally infringed but that those claims are invalid due to lack of novelty ( i.e. anticipated ) under 35 U.S.C.¡± 102 ( g )

Thomson submitted a motion requesting that the district_court either set aside the jury 's verdict of invalidity and enter Judgment as a Matter of Law ( `` JMOL '' ) holding the patents not invalid or grant a new_trial on the lack of novelty issue
Thomson argued that JMOL was proper because there was insufficient evidence in the record to support the jury 's anticipation verdict concerning certain claim limitations the court had held to be present following the Markman_hearing

In its opinion denying Thomson 's motion the district_court described evidence in the record supporting the jury 's finding of anticipation for each of the limitations that Thomson asserted had not been proven to be present in the MCA videodisc
See Thomson I 979 F.Supp.at 292-98
The court noted that the evidence supporting the anticipation finding came from one or more sources : the live testimony of two people who had worked on the MCA laser videodisc project ; an expert 's report and portions of his deposition testimony both of which were read into the record ; the expert 's exhibits ; and certain MCA documents that the expert had reviewed
Id.at 288 292-98
The court concluded that substantial evidence supports the jury 's finding that Quixote had shown by clear and convincing evidence that every limitation in the representative_claims was anticipated by the MCA device
Id.at 295 298

Thomson appeals the district_court 's denial of its motion for JMOL
