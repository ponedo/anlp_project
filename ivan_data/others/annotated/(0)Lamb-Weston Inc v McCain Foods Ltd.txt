Nos._93-1536 94-1225
| Feb._29,_1996
Synopsis
Food processor brought action against competitor for patent_infringement trademark_infringement unfair_competition and trademark_dilution with respect to its lattice-shape waffle-cut partially fried potato_product
The United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Washington Alan A. McDonald J. ruled that plaintiff 's patent was invalid and unenforceable 818_F.Supp._1376 and appeal was taken
The Court of Appeals held that : ( 1 ) patent for process of making frozen partially fried lattice-shaped french_fries called `` waffle_fries '' was invalid as obvious and ( 2 ) determination that patent was invalid as obvious made it unnecessary to determine whether patent was unenforceable because of inequitable_conduct

Affirmed and vacated

PER_CURIAM
The United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Washington held Lamb-Weston Inc. 's U.S._Patent_No._4937,084 ( the '084_patent ) invalid and unenforceable
Because prior_art renders the '084_patent obvious this court affirms the judgment on invalidity and vacates the judgment on inequitable_conduct

BACKGROUND
Lamb-Weston is a food processing company that sells frozen_potato_products
The defendants McCain Foods companies ( McCain ) compete with Lamb-Weston in the frozen_potato_products industry
Both Lamb-Weston and McCain make partially fried ( parfried ) and frozen_potato_products
Fierce competition in the frozen_potato_products market spurs development of new products
This litigation centers around Lamb-Weston 's development of frozen parfried lattice-shaped french_fries called `` waffle_fries ''

*542 In October 1979 an independent inventor Mr._Matsler offered to confidentially disclose his waffle fry slicing_apparatus to Lamb-Weston
In January 1980 Mr._Matsler demonstrated his slicing_apparatus but 98 % of the waffle fry slices were unusable
Nevertheless Lamb-Weston began negotiations with Mr._Matsler 's patent attorney to license the technology
Instead of contracting with Lamb-Weston Mr._Matsler licensed his invention to a Lamb-Weston competitor J.R. Simplot Company

In December 1979 Mr._Matsler demonstrated his cutting machine to a J.R. Simplot representative
Mr._Matsler fried some of his potato_slices and distributed them to customers at a local Dairy Queen Restaurant in Dallas Oregon

In February 1980 Lamb-Weston received a letter from Mr._Jayne another inventor offering to confidentially disclose his waffle fry cutting apparatus
In March 1980 Lamb-Weston evaluated Mr._Jayne 's machine but found it unacceptable
Lamb-Weston terminated communications with Mr._Jayne
Lamb-Weston then began developing its own machine starting with a commercial machine for making waffle-style potato_chips and adapting it to make waffle_fries

Lamb-Weston started testing its waffle_fries in 1980 and began selling them in late 1983 under the trademark `` CrissCut ''
In August 1983 Lamb-Weston filed a patent_application in the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( PTO ) on the waffle-cut potato_product the slicing_apparatus and the process for making the product
The patent_application had Serial No._06 /525,115 ( the '115 application )

The PTO initially rejected the application because it encompassed more than one invention
37 C.F.R.¡± 1.141 ( 1995 )
Lamb-Weston elected to proceed solely on the cutting apparatus claims which issued as U.S._Patent_No._4523,503 ( the '503_patent )
This patent is not at issue in this case

Lamb-Weston separated the process claims out of the '115 application
The patent examiner initially rejected this divisional application Serial No._06 /682,366 ( the '366 application ) as obvious over references disclosed on the face of the patent namely Canada Patent No._898057 ( Starke ) U.S. Patent No._678514 ( Regnier ) U.S._Patent_No._2612,453 ( Stahmer ) U.S._Patent_No._2767,752 ( Stahmer II ) U.S._Patent_No._1937,049 ( Toland et al
) U.S._Patent_No._3139,130 ( Urschel ) and U.S._Patent_No._1506,166 ( Boon )
Boon discloses a method for preparing frozen partially cooked french_fries
The other_references disclose waffle-shaped potato_products and slicing_apparatus
The examiner determined that one of ordinary_skill in the art would have found it obvious to freeze the waffle-cut potato_products disclosed in the other_references as Boon suggests

To escape this rejection Lamb-Weston amended the '366 application
Lamb-Weston emphasized that the prior_art disclosed waffle-cut potato_chips having a thickness of ?
inch or less unlike the Lamb-Weston invention with a thickness of about 4/BIG_TOKEN__16_to_10__BIG_TOKEN /16 inch
Despite the amendments the examiner finally rejected the '366 application on January 23 1986

Lamb-Weston appealed the final rejection to the PTO Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences ( Board )
In January 1990 the Board reversed the examiner 's rejection
The '366 application issued as the '084_patent the patent in dispute in this case

The '084_patent claims a parfried frozen potato slice
Claims 1_through_4 of the '084_patent read : 1
A parfried potato_product suitable for reconstitution by cooking comprising : a frozen sliced potato section having a substantially ellipsoidal shape and a variable thickness including a peak to peak thickness within the range of about 4/BIG_TOKEN__16_to_10__BIG_TOKEN /16 inch ; the section including opposed first and second_sides each side having longitudinal ridges and grooves therebetween the ridges and grooves of the first side extending angularly to the ridges and grooves of the second side ; the grooves of the first and second_sides having a depth sufficient to intersect one another to form a grid of openings in the potato section ; *543 the section before reconstitution having an oil_content of about 6-20 % by weight and a solids_content of about 32-40 % by weight ; whereby the product upon reconstitution by cooking is characterized by very thin crisp portions of locally increased oil flavor adjacent the openings relatively thick portions defined by intersecting ridges having an internal mealy texture and strong potato flavor similar to thick-cut french fried potato_strips and portions of intermediate thickness whose characteristics are similar to french_fried_shoe_string_potato_strips
2
The product of claim 1 wherein the section has an oil_content of about 16-20 % by weight and a solids_content of about 55-65 % by weight after oil fry reconstitution at a temperature within the range of about 350¢X_F to 360¢X_F for about 135-BIG_TOKEN__165_seconds._3__BIG_TOKEN
The product of claim 1 wherein the section has an oil_content of about 16-20 % by weight and a solids_content of about 55-65 % by weight after reconstitution whereby the thickest portions of the product have characteristics akin to thick-cut french fried potato_strips thinnest portions have characteristics akin to potato_chips and other portions have characteristics akin to french_fried_shoe_string_potato_strips
4
The product of claim 1 wherein the peak-to-peak thickness is about 7/16 inch

In 1985 McCain began making and selling frozen parfried waffle_fries
Lamb-Weston sued McCain for patent_infringement trademark_infringement unfair_competition and trademark_dilution
McCain counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment of patent invalidity and unenforceability and for damages under the antitrust laws
McCain later withdrew the antitrust claims

The district_court decided the issues of infringement enablement indefiniteness and inventorship in Lamb-Weston 's favor
The parties did not appeal these issues
The district_court decided the trademark and unfair_competition claims in McCain 's favor
The parties also did not appeal these issues

During the district_court proceedings Lamb-Weston conceded that waffle-cut potato_products were known since the early 1900s
The district_court found that waffle_fries were available at restaurants before Lamb-Weston developed its CrissCut fry
For example as early as 1935_and_1936 the Gem Cafe in Plainsville Texas served waffle_fries as a staple item
In 1979 the Plaza Restaurant in Quincy Illinois sold waffle_fries
In 1981 General Slicing/Red Goat Disposers sold a commercial electric slicing machine capable of slicing 5/16 inch thick waffle fry slices

In addition the district_court examined U.S._Patent_No._3397,993 ( the Strong_patent ) and found it relevant to obviousness under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103 ( 1994 )
The Strong_patent describes a parfry process where potato_slices are steam-blanched air-dried parfried and then frozen
Lamb-Weston as well as other potato processing companies uses the Strong_patent parfry process to prepare frozen parfried french_fries and reconstituted fries having all the textural limitations of the '084_patent
The district_court held that this process would have been familiar to a person of ordinary_skill in the art at the time of Lamb-Weston 's waffle fry invention

The district_court however did not find that the prior waffle fry uses and sales in the 1930s and the Strong_patent process provided the motivation to combine the waffle-cut potato_chips with the known parfried potato technology
The district_court said however that the Matsler and Jayne_devices provided that motivation
The district_court held the '084_patent claims invalid as obvious in light of the Matsler and Jayne_devices in combination with the prior parfried frozen potato technology including the Strong_patent
The district_court also found Lamb-Weston 's '084_patent unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct
Lamb-Weston appeals obviousness and inequitable_conduct determinations to this court
