Opinion
MICHEL Circuit_Judge
Nupla Corporation ( `` Nupla '' ) appeals the judgment based on the decisions of the United_States_District_Court for the Central_District of California No._95-7992- R granting two motions for partial_summary_judgment in favor of IXL Manufacturing Company Inc. ( `` IXL '' ) and dismissing the complaint as to all four of Nupla 's causes of action
The case was submitted for our decision following oral argument on January 27 1997
Because we agree that ( 1 ) Nupla 's United States Reissue Patent No
RE 32,364 ( `` '364_patent `` ) is invalid since the declaration submitted pursuant to 37 C.F.R.¡± 1.175 was insufficient as it addressed only one of three material_changes from the original_claims ; and ( 2 ) Nupla 's two registrations for the trademark_CUSH-N-GRIP U.S
Supplemental Reg
No._895244 ( `` '244 trademark '' ) and U.S
Principal Reg
No._1742,769 ( `` '769 trademark '' ) are invalid as a matter of law because the mark is generic we affirm

BACKGROUND
Nupla is the exclusive licensee of the '364 reissue_patent which was issued to inventor Joseph A. Carmien on February 24 1984
The invention is directed to tool_handles with flexible_cores that can be inserted into the tools
The flexible_core provides compressive support inside the handle and prevents buckling or collapse of the handle when the tool is subjected to high bending stress

The '364_patent is a reissue of U.S._Patent_No._4451,073 ( `` '073_patent `` )
The original_patent contained a single independent claim : A flexible_core for insertion into a handle receiving socket of a hand tool said core comprising : an elongated generally cylindrical body ; a plurality of grooves formed in said body and spaced from one another
along said body forming at least one socket filler for bearing
compressive load in said handle receiving socket ; and
a flexible shaft capable of bending to permit said core to conform to the
shape of said handle receiving socket

Carmien filed a reissue_application deleting original_claims 1-5 and substituting for them reissue_application claims 6-10 to change among other things the limitation `` a plurality of grooves '' to `` at least one groove ''
The reissue_application also added claims 11-19
His declaration filed pursuant to 37 C.F.R.¡± 1.175 explained that the original_patent contained an error in that its claims were too narrowly drawn to `` a plurality of grooves '' because of a mistake by the prosecuting patent attorney caused by the attorney 's misunderstanding of instructions given by the inventor
During the reissue examination the patent examiner rejected all of the reissue_application claims as unpatentable over U.S._Patent_No._4301,109 ( `` the Kain patent '' ) which relates to conveyor idlers
The claims were further amended without a supplementary declaration in response to this rejection and claims 6-19 were ultimately allowed

Nupla is also the owner of the '244 and '769 trademark registrations each of which is for the mark CUSH-N-GRIP in connection with tool_handles and replacement_handle_kits

Nupla filed a complaint against IXL on November 22 1995 for contributory infringement and inducing infringement of the '364 reissue_patent by IXL 's manufacture and sale of tool_handles and replacement handles and for IXL 's infringement of the CUSH-N-GRIP_trademark based on IXL 's use of the name CUSHION-GRIP in the sale and advertising of IXL 's products
