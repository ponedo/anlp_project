* Opinion
PLUNKETT District_Judge
The Rawlplug Company ( `` Rawlplug '' ) claims infringement of two of its patents by Illinois_Tool_Works ' ( `` ITW '' ) line of masonry_anchors manufactured and sold under the names of New_Striker and Hammer Loc
Both the patents in suit and ITW 's alleged infringing anchors relate to a single piece pre-shaped anchoring device for use in masonry

After a bench trial the district_court in a written opinion and order entered judgment in favor of the Defendant ITW and dismissed the Complaint
Rawlplug appeals claiming that the district_court erred in both interpreting the patent claims and in limiting their scope
For the reasons that follow we reverse and remand

BACKGROUND
This patent dispute concerns certain anchors designed to secure fixtures such as roofing material to masonry surfaces
The appellant Rawlplug manufactures and sells various fasteners including masonry_anchors for use in the construction industry
In the early 1980 's Rawlplug 's Vice-President for Manufacturing and Engineering Louis Giannuzzi conceived a design for a simple yet efficient masonry anchor
The design of this anchor can be generally described as consisting of a shank formed of resilient material such as heat tempered steel which is shaped during manufacture to include at least one bend along its longitudinal axis
This metal shank has a memory such that when forcibly deformed-e.g. pounded into a hole-it seeks to recover its original bent shape
As it returns to this original shape the anchor exerts outward pressure on the walls of the *1038 hole into which it has been driven
Rawlplug 's patents on this device which are set out in detail below are the subject of this suit

Through its Buildex and Ramset/Redhead Divisions appellee ITW is also engaged in the manufacture and sale of masonry_anchors
ITW manufactures two masonry_anchors under the tradenames `` New_Striker '' and `` Hammer-Loc ''
For purposes of this litigation the parties have stipulated that these two anchors are essentially the same
Hence we refer to them collectively under the title `` New_Striker ''

Rawlplug filed suit in the United_States_District_Court for the Southern_District of New York1 against ITW arguing that ITW 's New_Striker anchor infringed two of Rawlplug 's patents specifically U.S. Patent Nos._4828,445 ( `` the '445_patent `` ) and 4,963,062 ( `` the '062_patent `` )2 Rawlplug sought damages for willful infringement
ITW denied infringement

After a four-day bench trial the district_court concluded in a written opinion that the New_Striker did not infringe the claims asserted by Rawlplug either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents
Rawlplug Co. v. Illinois_Tool_Works 23_USPQ2d_1054 1992_WL_91703_(S.D.N.Y.1992)
Rawlplug has appealed from this judgment
