American_Airlines Inc. 37_USPQ2d_1534 1995_WL_822659_(S.D.Cal.1995) ( holding the '359_patent invalid )
Because the district_court correctly determined that there were no genuine_issues of material_fact in dispute and that American was entitled to judgment as a matter of law we affirm

BACKGROUND
The pertinent facts are not in dispute
Lockwood owns the '115 '355 and '359_patent s all of which relate to automated interactive sales terminals that provide sales_presentations to customers and allow the customers to order goods and services
Lockwood sued American asserting that American 's SABREvision airline reservation system infringed all three patents
SABREvision is used by travel_agents to access schedule and fare information to book itineraries and to retrieve photographs of places of interest including hotels restaurants and cruises for display to consumers
It improves upon American 's SABRE reservation system which originated in the 1960s and which can not display photographs

The '115_patent reissued in 1986 relates to a self-service sales terminal that presents audio-visual travelogs to customers
Claim 11 the only asserted claim reads in pertinent_part : A substantially self-contained apparatus dimensioned to be easily transported and installed at a commercial location comprising : an audio-visual_means for selectively dispensing information from a plurality of data sources ; customer operated means for selecting information to be dispensed on said audio-visual_means including means for sequentially and interactively displaying alternate selections of information on said audio-visual_means in response to customer 's commands ;.. at least one electromechanical means for accepting payment for said item from the customer ;..

The district_court held that American 's SABREvision did not infringe the '115_patent because it lacked four limitations of the asserted claim
Specifically the court found that SABREvision was not a `` substantially self-contained apparatus dimensioned to be easily transported '' and that it lacked the claimed `` audio-visual_means '' `` customer operated means '' and `` means for collecting payment ''

The '359_patent discloses a system of multiple interactive self-service terminals that provide audio-visual sales_presentations and dispense goods and services from multiple institutions
Claim 1 the only_independent_claim reads in pertinent_part : A system for automatically dispensing information goods and services for a plurality of institutions in a particular_industry comprising :.. at least one customer sales and information_terminal.... said sales and information_terminal including : audio-visual_means for interaction with a customer comprising : means for storing a sequence of audio and video information to be selectively transmitted to a customer ; means for transmitting a selected sequence of said stored information to the customer ; *1569 customer operated input_means for gathering information from a customer..

The district_court held that SABREvision did not infringe the '359_patent because it lacked the `` audio-visual_means '' and `` customer operated input_means ''
The court also held the '359_patent invalid because it would have been obvious in light of the original SABRE system in combination with the self-service terminal disclosed in U.S._Patent 4,359,631 which issued in 1982 and was subsequently reissued as the '115_patent

Finally the '355_patent which issued in 1994 discloses a system for augmenting the sales and marketing capabilities of travel_agents in conjunction with airline reservation systems by allowing travel_agents to compose individual customized sales_presentations for their clients
Claim 1 the only_independent_claim reads in pertinent_part : A system for automatically dispensing information goods or services for a plurality of institutions in a particular_industry comprising : a central data processing center including means for storing service price rate information or sales information for each institution ; at least one merchandising apparatus.... said merchandising apparatus including : a means for composing and displaying individualized_sales_presentations according to determinants entered into said apparatus and based on a customer 's profile and requests.. storage means holding a plurality of randomly accessible segments of data ;.. means for selectively combining said determinants to address and retrieve at least one of said segments..

The district_court held that SABREvision did not infringe the '355_patent because inter alia it did not compose `` individualized_sales_presentations '' or `` selectively combine '' customer information to retrieve its photographs
The court further held the '355_patent invalid under 35 U.S.C.¡± 102 ( b ) on the ground that its claims were anticipated by the '359_patent
The '355_patent issued from a chain of applications originating with the application that issued as the '359_patent
The district_court held that the '355_patent is not entitled to the filing date of the original parent application and thus concluded that the '359_patent is anticipating prior_art
Lockwood now appeals to this court arguing that the district_court erred in its construction of the claims of all three patents and contending that summary_judgment in favor of American on each issue is precluded because genuine_issues of material_fact remain in dispute
