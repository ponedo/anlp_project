Opinion
LINN Circuit_Judge
Stephen K. Terlep ( `` Terlep '' ) appeals from the decision of the United_States_District_Court for the Western_District of Arkansas ( `` district_court '' ) granting the motion of The Brinkmann_Corp. Wal-Mart_Stores Inc. and Home_Depot U.S.A. Inc. ( collectively `` Brinkmann '' ) for summary_judgment of non-infringement of U.S. Patent No._5594,433 ( `` the '433_patent `` )
Terlep v. Brinkmann_Corp. No._02-_CV-5127 ( W.D.Ark
March_29,_2004 ) ( `` Order I '' )
Because the district_court correctly construed the claim term `` clear '' and properly granted Brinkmann 's motion for summary_judgment of non-infringement we affirm

I
BACKGROUND
The '433_patent relates to omni-directional_light emitting diode ( `` LED '' ) lamps
LEDs are a desirable substitute for traditional incandescent lamps because of their increased lifetime higher resistance to shock and vibration and lower cost of production
However in contrast to an incandescent lamp which emits light omni-directionally the light from an LED is emitted in a forward cone of less than 90 degrees
The '433_patent is directed to the production of omni-directional_light by reflecting the cone of light from an LED off a semi-spherical convex reflector

Independent claim 1 recites with the terms at issue underlined : 1
An omni-directional LED lamp useful for traffic control and warning devices that reflects light in a 360 degree_circumferential_direction without having to rotate any components comprising : a first_LED ; a first semi-spherical reflector having a continuous convex reflective surface the first semi-spherical reflector mounted above the first_LED wherein light from the first_LED is reflected substantially in a 360 degree circumference rendering the first_LED omni-directional ; and
*1381 a first clear plastic tubular holder for tightly holding the first semi-spherical reflector oriented directly above the first_LED in a stationary non rotating position wherein the first semi-spherical reflector reflects light in a 360 degree_circumferential_direction
'433_patent col._6,_ll._13-28

Claim 4 depends from claim 1 and recites that the `` first semi-spherical reflector includes : a mirror finish deposited on a plastic shape ''
Id.at col._6,_ll._57-59

On November 28 1997 Terlep filed suit against Brinkmann alleging that Brinkmann 's products infringed claims 1_and_4 of the '433_patent literally and under the doctrine of equivalents
The accused products are solar-powered lamps for pathway_lighting
The lamps were sold through retailers Wal-Mart and Home_Depot
These lamps use an LED and a convex reflector that is less than a full half sphere
Further because they are used for pathway_lighting the relative orientation between the reflector and the LED when the product is in use is such that the reflector is located below the LED
Finally the Brinkmann lights use a ribbed holder to align and position the reflector in front of the LED
Brinkmann denied infringement and filed a counterclaim alleging invalidity
The district_court construed a number of disputed terms and based on the claim construction granted Brinkmann 's motion for summary_judgment of non-infringement and dismissed the claims with prejudice
Order I

On April_14,_2004 Terlep filed a notice of appeal
Because the district_court 's initial order did not address Brinkmann 's invalidity counterclaim this court determined that it lacked jurisdiction and dismissed the appeal
Terlep v. Brinkmann_Corp. 127_Fed.Appx._498_(Fed.Cir.2005)
Thereafter following a stipulation by the parties the district_court dismissed Brinkmann 's counterclaim without prejudice leaving no issues unresolved
Terlep v. Brinkmann_Corp. No._02-_CV-5127 ( W.D.Ark
March_24,_2005 ) ( `` Order II '' )

On March_10,_2005 Terlep filed a new notice of appeal and a motion to reinstate
In an Order entered April_11,_2005 this court recalled the mandate and reinstated the appeal
The appeal is now properly before us and we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
