Before RADER Circuit_Judge PLAGER Senior Circuit_Judge and BRYSON Circuit_Judge
Opinion
RADER Circuit_Judge
On summary_judgment the United_States_District_Court for the District of New_Jersey determined that claims 1_and_3 of U.S._Patent_No._4659,716 ( the ¡¬716_patent ) are invalid
Schering Corp. v. Geneva Pharm. Inc. No._98-1259 2002_WL_2001552 ( D.N.J
Aug.8 2002 )
Because the district_court correctly found that U.S._Patent_No._4282,233 ( the ¡¬233_patent ) inherently anticipates claims 1_and_3 of the ¡¬716_patent this court affirms

*1375 I. Schering Corporation ( Schering ) owns the ¡¬233 and ¡¬716_patent s on antihistamines
Antihistamines inhibit the histamines that cause allergic symptoms

The prior art ¡¬233_patent covers the antihistamine loratadine the active component of a pharmaceutical that Schering markets as CLARITIN ( tm )
Unlike conventional antihistamines when CLARITIN ( tm ) was launched loratadine does not cause drowsiness

The more recent ¡¬716_patent at issue in this case covers a metabolite of loratadine called descarboethoxyloratadine ( DCL )
A metabolite is the compound formed in the patient 's body upon ingestion of a pharmaceutical
The ingested pharmaceutical undergoes a chemical conversion in the digestion process to form a new metabolite compound
The metabolite_DCL is also a non-drowsy antihistamine
The ¡¬716_patent issued in April 1987 and will expire in April 2004 ( the ¡¬233_patent issued in 1981 and has since expired )
See 35 U.S.C.¡± 154 ( c ) ( 1 ) ( 2000 ) ( defining the term of a patent in force before June_8,_1995 as the greater of twenty years from the earliest U.S. priority date or seventeen years from grant )

Structurally loratadine and its metabolite_DCL differ only in that loratadine has a carboethoxy group ( i.e. -COOEt ) on a ring_nitrogen while DCL has a hydrogen atom on that ring_nitrogen :

?
Claim 1 of the ¡¬716_patent covers DCL ( for X = Cl ) its fluorine analog and their salts ; claim 3 covers only DCL and its salts : 1
A compound of the formula

?
or a pharmaceutically acceptable_salt thereof wherein X represents Cl or F. 3
A compound having the structural formula
*1376. ?
or a pharmaceutically acceptable_salt thereof
The ¡¬233_patent issued on August 4 1981 over one year before the earliest priority date of the ¡¬716_patent February 15 1984
The ¡¬233_patent is thus prior art to the ¡¬716_patent
See 35 U.S.C.¡± 102 ( b ) ( 2000 ) ( `` A person shall be entitled to a patent unless.. the invention was patented.. in this or a foreign country.. more than one year prior to the date of the application for patent in the United States `` )
The ¡¬233_patent discloses a class of compounds including loratadine ( disclosed in Example 1B )
¡¬233_patent col._3,_ll._5-12
The ¡¬233_patent claims loratadine in claim 7
Id. col._6,_ll._38-40
The ¡¬233_patent claims four other compounds in claims 8-11
Examples 6-7 are prophetic1 examples of pharmaceutical compositions ( a syrup and a tablet ) each containing an unidentified `` active compound ''
The ¡¬233_patent does not expressly disclose DCL and does not refer to metabolites of loratadine

The numerous defendants-appellees sought to market generic versions of loratadine once the ¡¬233_patent expired
Seeking regulatory approval each appellee submitted an application to the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA )
See 21 U.S.C.¡± 355 ( b ) ( j ) ( 2000 )
Because Schering included the ¡¬ 716 patent in the Orange Book listing for loratadine the applications also contained a certification that the ¡¬716_patent was invalid
See id.¡± 355 ( b ) ( 2 ) ( A ) 355 ( j ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ( vii )
The appellees notified Schering of the FDA_filings
See id.¡± 355 ( b ) ( 3 ) ( B ) 355 ( j ) ( 2 ) ( B ) ( ii )

After receiving notice of the FDA_filings Schering filed suit for infringement
See 35 U.S.C.¡± 271 ( e ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ( 2000 )
After discovery the parties filed cross motions for summary_judgment on the validity issue
The district_court construed claims 1_and_3 of the ¡¬716_patent to cover DCL in all its forms including `` metabolized within the human body '' and `` synthetically produced in a purified and isolated form ''
The parties agreed to that construction
Applying that claim construction the district_court found that the ¡¬233_patent did not expressly disclose DCL
Nonetheless the district_court also found that DCL was necessarily formed as a metabolite by carrying out the process disclosed in the ¡¬233_patent
The district_court concluded that the ¡¬233_patent anticipated claims 1_and_3 of the ¡¬716_patent under 35 U.S.C.¡± 102 ( b )
The district_court therefore granted the appellees ' motions for summary_judgment of invalidity
Schering timely appealed to this court under 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( 2000 )
