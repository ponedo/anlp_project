FRIEDMAN Senior_Circuit_Judge
This appeal challenges the district_court 's dismissal under Rule 12 ( b ) ( 6 ) of the Federal_Rules of Civil_Procedure for failure to state a valid_claim for relief of a complaint alleging that the defendant ( 1 ) monopolized two product_markets by enforcing a patent that had been obtained by fraud on the Patent and Trademark Office ( 2 ) infringed a different patent that the appellant owns and ( 3 ) breached a contract between the parties
We reverse the dismissal of the antitrust and patent_claims vacate the dismissal of the state law claim and remand for further proceedings

I
A
Industry Background
According to the second amended complaint the appellants Hydril Company L.P. and Hydril_U.K._Ltd. ( collectively `` Hydril '' ) manufacture threaded connections for interlocking lengths of drill_pipe used in drilling oil and gas wells
Pls '
2nd Am
Compl
? ?
8-14
Hydril does not itself make drill_pipe but outside the United_States it sometimes sells finished drill_pipe that uses its connections and pipe manufactured by someone else
Id
?
15
The appellee Grant_Prideco Inc. ( `` Grant_Prideco '' ) manufactures *1346 and sells both drill_pipe and its own line of connections
Id
?
16

Hydril generally sells its connections to drill_pipe distributors `` who are assembling finished drill_pipe for an end-user '' id
?
14 which `` typically '' is a drilling contractor or a major oil company
Id
?
10
`` Finished drill_pipe is usually specially manufactured to meet an order from the end-user ''
Id
This case involves drill_pipe whose diameter is 5 ? -inches-a product that Hydril alleges has `` unique characteristics '' for certain types of drilling
Id
? ?
18-28

B
The Antitrust Claim
This claim involves Grant_Prideco 's United_States Patent No._6244,631 ( `` the ¡¬631_patent `` ) which covers a combination of raw pipe with specified diameters and connections that fit such pipe
Id
? ?
31-33

Paragraph 57 of the complaint encapsulates the antitrust_claim as follows : Under the theory of Walker_Process Equipment Inc. v. Food_Machinery & Chemical Corp. 382_U.S._172 86_S.Ct._347 15_L.Ed.2d_247_(1965) Grant_Prideco has violated Section 2 of the Sherman_Act by obtaining and maintaining market_power in the relevant_markets by use of threats to enforce a patent that Grant_Prideco knew was procured by fraud

The alleged fraud was that `` [ d ] uring the application process for the ¡¬631_patent Grant_Prideco failed to disclose to the USPTO_material_prior_art of which Grant_Prideco was aware ''
Id
?
35
The complaint referred to various items of prior_art that Grant_Prideco failed to disclose id
? ?
38-40 and stated : The ¡¬631_Patent as issued would not have been granted to Grant_Prideco had Grant_Prideco not omitted from its disclosures such known information on the prior_art including its own prior sales of covered technology
Id
?
43

The complaint further stated that `` Grant_Prideco 's concealment of prior_art from the USPTO continued even after the ¡¬631_Patent issued '' and that Grant_Prideco 's `` filing for reissue with disclosure of only selective prior_art was also an attempt to practice fraud on the USPTO ''
Id
?
44

The complaint described the `` relevant [ product ] markets '' as `` ( 1 ) the market for connections used with 5 ? -inch outer diameter pipe ; and ( 2 ) the market for finished 5 ? -inch drill_pipe ''
Id
?
45
It stated that the `` relevant [ geographic ] markets '' for both products were `` worldwide ''
Id
?
46

The complaint alleged that
Grant_Prideco has obtained and maintained its market_power in the relevant_markets by wrongfully threatening to enforce the ¡¬631_Patent against other market participants including connections manufacturers drill_pipe distributors and end-users
Grant_Prideco has obtained a dominant position in the sale of connections of all practically-functional sizes for use with 5 ? -inch drill_pipe making a substantial_portion of all sales of connections for such use
Similarly Grant_Prideco dominates the 5 ? -inch drill_pipe market.. Grant_Prideco makes a substantial_portion of all sales of finished 5 ? -inch drill_pipe worldwide
Id.at ?
47

Finally the alleged `` use of threats to enforce a [ fraudulently procured ] patent '' was that
Grant_Prideco has widely publicized the existence of the ¡¬631_Patent to the industry in general and also has directed communications to particular industry *1347 participants suggesting that Grant_Prideco would act aggressively to challenge activities that it saw as potentially infringing
For example on January 29 2003 Grant_Prideco 's outside patent counsel wrote a letter to OMSCO a drill_pipe distributor that holds license rights to manufacture Hydril 's Wedge Thread tool joints
The letter asserted that certain orders from OMSCO 's customers for 5 7/8-inch pipe with 7-inch tool joints may violate the ¡¬631_Patent
The orders referenced were presumably from the end-use drilling contractor Atwood Oceanics which was copied on letter
The letter suggested that OMSCO take action to `` ensure that [ Grant_Prideco 's ] patent_rights are being respected '' in connection with OMSCO 's sales of drill_pipe
Grant_Prideco 's letter was intended and understood to be a threat to OMSCO to refrain from sales of 5 7/8-inch drill_pipe
On information and belief Grant_Prideco also communicated a similar message asserting its patent to others in the pipe and drilling industries including Diamond Offshore Tuboscope and Riteco
Id
?

C. The Breach of Contract and Patent Infringement Claims
These claims arise out of the following allegations in the complaint : `` Grant_Prideco has breached a technology_licensing_agreement with Hydril and violated Hydril 's patent_rights over 'wedge thread ' technology '' which is `` a technology developed by Hydril for making high-torque connections between neighboring pieces of pipe tubing or conduit ''
Id
? ?
63-64
Hydril 's United_States Patent Reissue No._34467 ( `` the ¡¬467_patent `` ) covers some of that technology
Id
?
65

In the late 1980s former Hydril employees with extensive knowledge of Hydril 's wedge_thread_technology left the company and founded XLS Holding Inc. and XL Systems Inc. ( collectively `` XLS '' )
After XLS `` began marketing wedge thread connections without a license to use Hydril 's intellectual_property [ ] Hydril sued XLS for misappropriation of trade_secrets and know-how and for patent_infringement
That lawsuit settled in 1994 on confidential terms with Hydril receiving an equity stake in XLS
Following and as part of the settlement XLS focused its wedge_technology_activities on large-diameter_connections ( 20 inches and over ) and Hydril focused its wedge_technology_activities on smaller-diameter_connections ( less than 20 inches ) ''
Id
?
66

`` In August 1997 the owners of XLS ( including Hydril ) sold the equity of the company to an affiliate of Grant_Prideco
( 'Merger_Agreement ' )
Grant_Prideco and its other affiliates had never before offered wedge_thread_technology
Accordingly in connection with the transaction Hydril Grant_Prideco and various related entities executed a license sharing agreement known as the Wedge Thread License Agreement ( 'Wedge_Agreement ' ) '' id
? ?
67-68 which the record shows was an exhibit to the Merger_Agreement and which both Hydril and Grant_Prideco signed

`` Under the Wedge_Agreement Hydril granted Grant_Prideco the exclusive right to use Hydril 's existing intellectual_property including the protected know-how and trade_secrets on wedge technology to make large-diameter_connections thus allowing Grant_Prideco to essentially continue XLS 's large-diameter_business ''

`` In exchange Grant_Prideco granted Hydril the exclusive license to use XLS 's wedge thread patents trade_secrets and know-how to make smaller-diameter_connections ''

`` Under the exclusivity provisions of the Wedge_Agreement Grant_Prideco is restricted from using the licensed intellectual *1348 property and know-how from its large-diameter_business to develop smaller-diameter_connections
Similarly Hydril is restricted from using the licensed intellectual_property or know-how from its smaller-diameter_business to develop large-diameter_connections ''

`` Under [ those provisions ] either party could develop products in the other 's field so long as it did so completely independently of the intellectual_property and know-how of its existing business ''
Id
? ?
70-73

`` Grant_Prideco has materially breached its obligations under the Wedge_Agreement by improperly disclosing intellectual_property and by improperly using intellectual_property it agreed would be used only for large-diameter_connections as part of Grant_Prideco 's development of smaller-diameter_connections ''
Id
?
81
The complaint described various actions by Grant_Prideco that constituted the alleged breaches of the confidentiality provisions of the Wedge_Agreement
Id
? ?
75-80

According to the complaint the foregoing activities by Grant_Prideco constituted `` a material breach of the Wedge_Agreement and ended Grant_Prideco 's field-of-use license to Hydril 's patents trade_secrets and know-how ''
Id
? ?
84-85
Thus Hydril alleges as a result of the termination of the Wedge_Agreement Grant_Prideco 's actions infringed Hydril 's ¡¬467_patent
Id
?
?
87-91

D. The District Court Decision
In two separate opinions the district_court dismissed the antitrust and patent_claims for failure to state a valid_claim for relief pursuant to Rule 12 ( b ) ( 6 ) of the Federal_Rules of Civil_Procedure

In dismissing the antitrust_claim the district_court held that `` [ b ] ecause Hydril has failed to allege enforcement_activity by Grant_Prideco which would create an objectively reasonable_apprehension that Grant_Prideco intended to enforce the ¡¬631_Patent against Hydril Plaintiffs have failed to allege the minimum_level of enforcement necessary to state a Walker_Process_claim against Grant_Prideco ''
Hydril_Co. L.P. v. Grant_Prideco L.P. 385_F.Supp.2d_609 612 ( S.D.Tex.2005 ) ( `` Hydril_II `` )
The court stated that neither plaintiff `` alleges enforcement_activity by Grant_Prideco which would create an objectively reasonable_apprehension that Grant_Prideco might sue Hydril for patent_infringement '' ; and that `` the January 2003 letter to OMSCO does not contain an explicit threat or other language which under the totality of the circumstances could create a reasonable_apprehension on Hydril 's part that Grant_Prideco might sue it for patent_infringement
There is no allegation that any similar letters sent by Grant_Prideco or its counsel to others in the pipe and drilling industry were more explicit or otherwise indicated Grant_Prideco 's intention to enforce the ¡¬631_patent against Hydril or others ''
Id.at 611-12

The district_court dismissed the patent_claim on the ground that in a provision of the 1997 merger agreement between Hydril and Grant_Prideco ( Section 12.12 discussed in Part III below ) the parties waived the right to sue for patent_infringement `` relating to this agreement '' and provided only a breach of contract remedy for such claims
Hydril_Co. L.P. v. Grant_Prideco L.P. No
Civ.A
H-05-0337 2005_WL_1515422 at *3 ( S.D.Tex
June_22,_2005 ) ( `` Hydril I `` )
It concluded that `` Hydril agreed in ¡± 12.12 ( a ) of the Merger_Agreement to waive its right to enforce its statutory rights in the ¡¬ 467 Patent against Grant_Prideco ''
Id.at *4

Finally the district_court declined to exercise `` supplemental_jurisdiction '' over the `` state law breach of contract_claim '' which it denied without prejudice to the plaintiffs refiling it in state court
Hydril_II at 612

*1349 II
A
In Walker_Process the Supreme_Court `` concluded that the enforcement of a patent procured by fraud on the Patent_Office may be violative of ¡± 2 of the Sherman_Act provided the other elements necessary to a ¡± 2 case are present ''
382 U.S. at 174 86_S.Ct._347
It stated that Walker_Process `` alleged that Food_Machinery obtained the patent by knowingly and willfully misrepresenting facts to the Patent_Office
Proof of this assertion would be sufficient to strip Food_Machinery of its exemption from the antitrust_laws '' that the patent provided
Id.at 177 86_S.Ct._347
The Court pointed out that `` [ t ] o establish monopolization or attempt to monopolize.. under ¡± 2 of the Sherman_Act it would then be necessary to appraise the exclusionary power of the illegal patent_claim in terms of the relevant_market for the product involved ''
Id

This court has `` consistently explained that Walker_Process_fraud is a variant of common_law_fraud '' `` and that the elements of common_law_fraud include : ( 1 ) a representation of a material fact ( 2 ) the falsity of that representation '' and `` ( 3 ) the intent to deceive or at least a state of mind so reckless as to the consequences that it is held to be the equivalent of intent ( scienter ) ''
Unitherm Food Sys Inc. v. Swift-Eckrich Inc. 375_F.3d_1341 1358 ( Fed.Cir.2004 ) ( citations omitted ) rev 'd on other grounds 546_U.S._394 126_S.Ct._980 163_L.Ed.2d_974_(2006)

As noted Hydril 's complaint alleged that Grant_Prideco had fraudulently obtained its ¡¬631_patent by `` fail [ ing ] to disclose to the USPTO_material_prior_art of which [ it ] was aware '' ( which the complaint described ) and that `` [ t ] he ¡¬631_Patent as issued would not have been granted to Grant_Prideco had Grant_Prideco not omitted from its disclosures such known information on the prior_art ''
If Hydril can prove these allegations they would ground a claim of monopolization in violation of ¡± 2 of the Sherman_Act because they `` would be sufficient to strip [ Grant_Prideco ] of its exemption from the antitrust_laws '' its patent would otherwise provide
Walker_Process 382 U.S. at 177 86_S.Ct._347 ( footnote omitted )

The complaint alleges that Grant_Prideco obtained its patent by knowingly and deliberately concealing from the Patent_Office_prior_art that it knew would have resulted in a denial of its application
Since neither the patent_application nor the prosecution history is before us we can not tell whether it is contended that in obtaining the patent Grant_Prideco made affirmative misstatements to the Patent_Office about the prior_art
Cf
Walker_Process where the complaint `` alleged fraud on the basis that Food_Machinery had sworn before the Patent_Office that it neither knew nor believed that its invention had been in public use in the United_States for more than one year prior to filing its patent_application when in fact Food_Machinery was a party to prior use within such time ''
382 U.S. at 174 86_S.Ct._347
In any event the complaint 's allegations here go far beyond a simple failure to disclose to the Patent_Office_prior_art that the examiner would have deemed material

Under our precedent the conduct alleged in Hydril 's complaint would constitute Walker_Process_fraud
Cf
Nobelpharma AB v. Implant Innovations Inc. 141_F.3d_1059 1070 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) ( `` We agree that if the evidence shows that the asserted patent was acquired by means of either a fraudulent_misrepresentation or a fraudulent_omission and that the party asserting the patent was aware of the fraud when bringing suit such conduct can expose a patentee to liability under the antitrust_laws
We arrive at this conclusion because a fraudulent_omission can be just *1350 as reprehensible as a fraudulent_misrepresentation
`` )

B
The district_court dismissed the antitrust_claim because Hydril `` failed to allege the minimum_level of enforcement necessary to state a Walker_Process_claim against Grant_Prideco '' since it did not `` allege enforcement_activity by Grant_Prideco which would create an objectively reasonable_apprehension that Grant_Prideco intended to enforce the ¡¬631_patent against Hydril ''
Hydril_II at 612
It is unclear whether the defect the court discerned in Hydril 's complaint was a failure to allege sufficient enforcement_activity by Grant_Prideco i.e. such as would create a `` reasonable expectation '' that Grant_Prideco would file patent_infringement litigation or a failure to threaten such activity against Hydril itself rather than against Hydril 's customers
Neither ground however justifies dismissal of the complaint at what the district_court described as the `` very early stages '' of the case
Id

In relying on the enforcement ground the district_court noted our statement in Unitherm that `` as a matter of Federal Circuit antitrust law the standards that we have developed for determining jurisdiction in a Declaratory_Judgment_Action of patent invalidity also define the minimum_level of 'enforcement ' necessary to expose the patentee to a Walker_Process_claim for attempted monopolization ''
Id
( citing Unitherm 375 F.3d at 1358 )
To the extent the district_court 's ruling may have been based on Hydril 's failure to allege threatened enforcement action against Hydril rather than against its customers a valid Walker_Process_claim may be based upon enforcement_activity directed against the plaintiff 's customers
Threats of patent litigation against customers based on a fraudulently-procured patent with a reasonable likelihood that such threats will cause the customers to cease dealing with their supplier is the kind of economic coercion that the antitrust_laws are intended to prevent
A supplier may be equally injured if it loses its share of the market because its customers stop dealing with it than if its competitor directs its monopolistic endeavors against the supplier itself
Without customers a supplier has no business

Our recent_decision in Microchip Technology Inc. v. The Chamberlain Group 441_F.3d_936_(Fed.Cir.2006) does not require a different conclusion
There we held that a district_court did not have jurisdiction under the Declaratory_Judgment_Act to entertain a suit raising various patent issues because the threats of enforcement litigation directed against the patentee 's customers failed to satisfy the first part of our test for declaratory judgment jurisdiction-that `` the declaratory plaintiff must establish.. a reasonable_apprehension that it will face a patent_infringement suit if it commences or continues the activity at issue ''
Id.at 942
For the reasons previously given we decline to extend that ruling to invalidate a Walker_Process_claim alleging threats of infringement litigation directed against a supplier 's customers by the holder of a patent allegedly procured by fraud on the Patent_Office
( This case does not present an occasion to address the Supreme_Court 's recent_decision in Medimmune Inc. v. Genentech Inc. 549_U.S._118 127_S.Ct._764 166_L.Ed.2d_604_(2007) which dealt with the standard for determining when a declaratory judgment action satisfies the case-or-controversy requirement of the Declaratory_Judgment_Act )

C. Grant_Prideco contends that the district_court 's dismissal of the antitrust_claim may be upheld on various other grounds on which the district_court did not rely
It contends that under Fifth_Circuit_antitrust_law which we apply in deciding non-patent antitrust questions *1351 Unitherm 375 F.3d at 1355 Hydril 's antitrust_claim fails for the following three additional reasons :

1
Hydril has not shown injury in fact because it alleges only exclusion from the international market but not from the domestic market ; does not allege that it made or sold an infringing product ; and does not allege improper conduct `` during the effective [ time ] period of the [ ¡¬631 ] patent ''

2
Hydril and Hydril U.K. are `` remote parties '' who can not maintain the Walker_Process_claim

3
Hydril has not alleged that the ¡¬631_patent gave Grant_Prideco any market_power in the relevant_market

Although we may affirm a district_court judgment on any ground shown by the record even though that was not the basis of the district_court 's decision Lion Raisins Inc. v. United_States 416_F.3d_1356 1368 ( Fed.Cir.2005 ) that authority is discretionary not mandatory
See Q Int ' l Courier Inc. v. Smoak 441_F.3d_214 220_n._3_(4th_Cir.2006) ( `` The defendants also argue several alternative grounds for affirmance
Although we are not precluded from addressing these arguments we deem it more appropriate to allow the district_court to consider them if necessary in the first_instance on remand `` )
In the present case we decline to consider these additional grounds for affirmance because we conclude that they would be more appropriately addressed in the first_instance by the district_court

The alternative grounds for affirmance appear to involve complex and difficult questions of Fifth_Circuit_antitrust_law which the parties sharply dispute and the answers to which may be far from clear
The answers may require careful study of an already substantial record or even augmentation of that record
The district_court appears to be in the best position initially to resolve these issues and such resolution seems to be the best course to follow here
