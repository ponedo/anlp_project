Synopsis
Patentee brought action for infringement of patents relating to transmission and use of digital_information
The United_States_District_Court for the Central_District of California Edward Rafeedie J. entered judgment upon jury_verdict finding both patents invalid but that one patent was infringed if valid
Patentee appealed and alleged infringer filed conditional cross-appeal
The Court of Appeals Pauline Newman Circuit_Judge held that : ( 1 ) patentee failed to preserve objection to verdict form ; ( 2 ) first patent was invalid due to prior public use ; and ( 3 ) second patent was invalid as obvious

Affirmed

Opinion
PAULINE NEWMAN Circuit_Judge
Mitsubishi Electric Corporation appeals the judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the Central_District of California concerning Mitsubishi 's United_States_Patent_No._4336,612 ( `` the '612_patent `` ) and United_States_Patent_No._4665,533 ( `` the '533_patent `` )1 The jury_verdict was that the asserted claims of both patents were invalid and that none of the asserted claims of the '612_patent was infringed either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents but that claim 1 of the '533_patent was literally infringed if valid
On appeal Mitsubishi requests either a new_trial or judgment in its favor as a matter of law
Ampex has filed a conditional cross-appeal of the verdict that it infringes the '533_patent

The district_court entered judgment on the jury_verdicts and denied all post-trial motions
We affirm the judgment

I
THE '612_PATENT
The '612_patent entitled `` Error Correction Encoding and Decoding System '' *1302 granted on June_22,_1982 is directed to a system for correcting errors that occur during the transmission recording or reproduction of digital_information
For example in making a digital recording of music on magnetic tape errors may occur when a particle of dust lands on a recording head
This dust can cause strings of erroneous binary bits called a `` burst error ''
In the error correction system of the '612_patent digital_information ( the data to be transmitted or recorded or reproduced ) is arranged in an array of bits and is encoded such that when errors occur they can be located and corrected on decoding allowing accurate recovery of the original information

According to the '612_patent the digital_information is divided into a two-dimensional rectangular_array of bits described as an array of k1_bits in the horizontal direction and an array of k2 bits in the vertical direction
During encoding error correcting codes are used to add check information to the data in each direction
An error correcting code C2 is used for data in one direction of the array and an error correcting code C1 s used for data in the second_direction of the array
The term `` product code '' refers generally to the use of these codes
Because the system uses these codes for data in both the horizontal and the vertical directions the system 's error correction capability is enhanced
Claim 1 of the '612_patent describes the claimed system as follows : 1
An encoding and decoding system for digital_information having a rectangular_array of bits including k1_bits in a first_direction and k2 bits in a second_direction orthogonal to the first_direction which system comprises
encoding_means including an encoding adapting circuit for codes C2 for dividing the k1_bits in the first_direction into b_bits apiece and forming a plurality of k2_X b bit rectangular_arrays each including the b_bits in the first_direction and the k2 bits in the second_direction a C2_encoder for encoding the plurality of k2_X b bit rectangular_arrays into a plurality of n2 X b bit rectangular_arrays each including the b_bits in the first_direction and n2_bits in the second_direction a C1_encoder for encoding the k1_bits in the first_direction into n1_bits by adding n1-k1 check bits to the k1_bits in the first_direction and a timing generator circuit for generating timing_signals for controlling the operation of said encoding_means to thereby encode the digital_information into a codeword of a generalized_product_code including the n1_bits in the first_direction and the n2_bits in the second_direction ; and decoding means operatively connected to said encoding_means by a transmission means for decoding the digital_information encoded by the encoding_means ; wherein said C1 and C2_encoders are operative to encode in response to said timing_signals of said timing generator and wherein either said C1_encoder or said C2_encoder provides said generalized_product_code
Claim 2 adds an information_matrix-forming circuit for arranging digital_information into a rectangular_array of bits and claim 3 describes the information_matrix-forming circuit as containing RAM devices and selector means
Claim 11 adds elements including an erasure weight calculation circuit and an erasure location calculation circuit

The explanation of this technology and much of the discussion of its technological and legal significance was presented at trial through the testimony of expert_witnesses
Experts for both sides testified to the meaning of various technical terms as used in this system the scope of the claims as applied to the accused device the content *1303 of the prior_art the relation of the patented technology to the prior_art and other aspects relating to both validity and infringement
The issues at trial and indeed on appeal were complex in fact and law
No challenge is raised as to the technical competence and admissibility of the expert testimony see generally Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael 526_U.S._137 119_S.Ct._1167 143_L.Ed.2d_238_(1999) although the parties dispute the opinions expressed and the conclusions drawn by the expert_witnesses

The district_court and the Federal_Circuit on appeal each reviewing the jury 's verdicts must determine whether the law was correctly stated including the jury_instructions on claim construction and whether there was substantial evidence to support the jury 's verdicts
See e.g. Al-Site Corp. v. VSI Int ' l Inc. 174_F.3d_1308 1314 50_U.S.P.Q.2d_1161 1164 ( Fed.Cir.1999 ) ( after interpreting the claims district_court instructed jury to apply its construction of the claims to determine infringement ) ; Shatterproof Glass Corp. v. Libbey-Owens Ford Co. 758_F.2d_613 626 225_U.S.P.Q._634 643 ( Fed.Cir.1985 ) ( In reviewing a district_court 's denial of a motion for new_trial we review the jury_instructions as a whole to determine whether clear error occurred such that the jury was misled
)
