PSC Computer Products Inc. ( `` PSC '' ) appeals the final judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the Central_District of California granting Foxconn International Inc. and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. Ltd. ( collectively `` Foxconn '' ) summary_judgment of non-infringement of U.S. Patent No._6061,239 ( the `` ¡¬239_patent `` )
PSC Computer Prods. Inc. v. Foxconn Int ' l No._01- CV-6414
Because PSC dedicated plastic_clips to the public by explicitly claiming only clips made of metal while specifically disclosing that the prior_art included clips made of plastic we affirm

BACKGROUND
The United States Patent and Trademark Office ( `` PTO '' ) issued the ¡¬239_patent for a `` Cam-Type Retainer Clip for Heat Sinks for Electronic Integrated Circuits ''
The ¡¬239_patent was assigned to PSC
The ¡¬239_patent covers a small but significant component of a complex technology product-the microchip
Like many electronic *1355 components an operating microchip generates heat
A microchip generates heat as electrons flow through the `` logic_gates '' that enable it to compute the desired outputs from its given inputs
An operating microchip generates heat proportional to the number of logic_gates on that chip
Because modern chips generate enough heat to risk becoming self-destructive system designers need to include heat_sinks to dissipate the heat
This heat dissipation extends the useful life of both the microchip and adjacent heat sensitive components

The ¡¬239_patent describes an invention for securing a heat_sink to a chip using a cam-type_retainer_clip
Claim 1 of the ¡¬239_patent claims : In a heat_sink_assembly providing cooling to an electronic semiconductor device wherein the device is mounted in a module the module having means for engagement with a retainer_clip and the heat_sink having a generally flat bottom surface and heat conducting engagement with the semiconductor device upper_surface and a plurality of fins on the upper_surface defining at least one channel the improvement comprising a heat_sink retainer_clip including : an elongated resilient_metal_strap received in one of the channels of the heat_sink having holding means at each end engaging the engagement means on the module the center_portion of the strap spaced a predetermined distance above the upper_surface of the heat_sink base when the strap is not in tension ; and
a cam-type latch pivotally mounted in the center_portion of the strap and including a cam with a bearing surface the distance from the pivot_access to the bearing surface of the cam being greater than the distance between the pivot_access and the upper_surface of the base of the heat_sink when said strap is not in tension and an arm fixedly mounted to said cam said arm when rotated causing said bearing surface of said cam to be forced against the surface of the base of the heat_sink placing the strap in tension so as to force the heat_sink into heat conducting engagement with the module
'239_patent col._6,_ll._6-31 ( emphasis added )

The strap and the latch are the only two parts of a cam-type_retainer_clip for a heat_sink_assembly as implied by Claim 1
One way that vendors can differentiate their products is by manufacturing these clip parts out of different materials
The choice of materials for the retainer_clip lies at the heart of this dispute
PSC and Foxconn sell competing cam-type_retainer_clips for heat_sink assemblies
PSC 's clip is made of metal while Foxconn 's clip is made of plastic
PSC filed suit in the United_States_District_Court for the Central_District of California alleging that Foxconn 's clip infringed the ¡¬ 239 patent
PSC conceded that Foxconn 's clip did not literally infringe the ¡¬239_patent because Claim 1 covers clips containing `` an elongated resilient_metal_strap '' and Foxconn 's clip was made of plastic but maintained nonetheless that Foxconn 's plastic_clip infringes the ¡¬239_patent under the doctrine of equivalents
Foxconn in turn argued that PSC had dedicated clips with plastic_parts to the public and moved for summary_judgment of non-infringement on that ground

The district_court reviewed the ¡¬239_patent 's claims and written description and agreed with Foxconn that PSC had dedicated plastic_clips to the public
In granting summary_judgment to Foxconn the district_court relied on our recent decision in Johnson & Johnston Associates v. R.E
Service Co. 285_F.3d_1046_(Fed.Cir.2002) ( en banc ) where we held that a patent applicant who discloses but does not *1356 claim subject_matter has dedicated that matter to the public and can not reclaim the disclosed matter under the doctrine of equivalents
Id
We had previously outlined this rule in Maxwell v. J. Baker Inc. 86_F.3d_1098_(Fed.Cir.1996) where we similarly held that a patent that disclosed subject_matter in its written description without claiming it dedicated that subject_matter to the public and that use of the dedicated matter did not infringe the patent
The district_court here determined that because the written description of the ¡¬239_patent disclosed clips made of plastic_parts without claiming plastic it had dedicated plastic_clips to the public
Foxconn therefore could not infringe the ¡¬239_patent by equivalents because its plastic_clips used materials in the public domain

In reaching that conclusion the district_court noted the specific language in the written description stating that : `` [ t ] he elongated strap [ ] is made of a resilient metal such as stainless steel although other resilient materials may be suitable for the strap '' ¡¬239_patent col._4,_ll._49-51 ( emphasis added ) and that `` [ o ] ther prior_art devices use molded plastic and/or metal parts that must be cast or forged which again are more expensive metal forming operations ''
Id. col. 2. ll
39-41 ( emphasis added )

According to the district_court these passages demonstrate that at the time that the inventor applied for the ¡¬239_patent he knew that other materials including plastic could be used to make `` parts '' of his invention and that the inventor asserted the metal design of the ¡¬239_patent as an improvement over the prior_art
The ¡¬239_patent however does not claim plastic_parts but instead includes an explicit `` metal '' limitation
The district_court applied Johnson to conclude that the disclosure of unclaimed materials in the ¡¬ 239 patent 's written description dedicated those materials to the public
This dedication prevented PSC from using the doctrine of equivalents to extend the scope of its patent claims to include plastic

The district_court found further support for this conclusion in SciMed Life Systems v. Advanced Cardiovascular Systems 242_F.3d_1337_(Fed.Cir.2001) where we explained that : Where the specification makes clear that the invention does not include a particular feature that feature is deemed to be outside the reach of the claims of the patent even though the language of the claims read without reference to the specification might be considered broad enough to encompass the feature in question
Id.at 1341
Having specifically identified criticized and disclaimed [ a specific ] configuration the patentee can not now invoke the doctrine of equivalents to `` embrace a structure that was specifically excluded from the claims ''
Id.at 1345 ( citation omitted )

Based upon these precedents the district_court determined that PSC had disclosed and dedicated the use of non-metallic resilient materials specifically including plastic and could not now invoke the doctrine of equivalents to embrace specifically disclosed materials that had not been claimed
The district_court granted Foxconn summary_judgment of non-infringement
PSC timely appealed
We have jurisdiction of this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
