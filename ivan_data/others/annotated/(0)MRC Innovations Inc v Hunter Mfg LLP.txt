D634,488 S ( `` ¡¬488_patent `` ) and D634 487 S ( `` ¡¬487_patent `` )
For the reasons stated below we affirm

BACKGROUND
MRC is the owner by assignment of both patents-in-suit
The ¡¬488_patent claims an ornamental_design for a football_jersey for a dog while the ¡¬487_patent does the same for a baseball_jersey as shown below :

?
?
*1329 Mark_Cohen is the named inventor of both patents ; he is the principal shareholder of MRC and assigned his rights in both patents to that company
Appellee Hunter Manufacturing LLP is a retailer of licensed sports consumer products including pet_jerseys
Prior to September 9 2009 Hunter purchased pet_jerseys for dogs from Mark_Cohen through companies with which he was affiliated
For example Cohen supplied Hunter with a `` V2 '' football_jersey through the Stephen Gould Corporation and through Fun-in-Games Inc. ( `` FiG '' )
Similarly Cohen supplied Hunter through FiG with a green pet jersey bearing a Philadelphia Eagles logo which Hunter then sold through third-party retailers such as Wal-Mart and PetSmart prior to July_30,_2009
The V2 and Eagles jerseys are depicted below :

?
*1330 Cohen asserts that in 2009 he designed another pet jersey known as the `` V3 '' jersey which would later become the subject of the ¡¬488_patent
Hunter began purchasing the V3_jersey from FiG sometime after September 8 2009
On September 8 2010 Cohen filed a patent application for both the V3_jersey and the baseball equivalent that would later become the subject of the ¡¬ 487 patent

In December 2010 Cohen informed Hunter that he no longer intended to do business with Hunter because Hunter was having difficulty making payments
Hunter then sought proposals from other companies to manufacture and supply it with pet_jerseys like the V3
Ultimately Hunter contracted with another supplier appellee CDI_International Inc. to supply Hunter with pet_jerseys

Both patents-in-suit eventually issued on March_15,_2011

MRC filed suit against both Hunter and CDI for willful infringement of both patents
The district_court granted summary_judgment in favor of Hunter and CDI on the grounds that both patents are invalid as obvious under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103 ( a )
MRC_Innovations Inc. v. Hunter Mfg. LLP 921_F.Supp.2d_800 812 ( N.D.Ohio 2013 )
The district_court denied summary_judgment of invalidity based on 35 U.S.C.¡± 112
Id.at 810-11

MRC appealed the grant of summary_judgment
We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
