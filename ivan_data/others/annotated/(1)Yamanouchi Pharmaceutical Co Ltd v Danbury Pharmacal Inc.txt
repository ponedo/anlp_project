Before NEWMAN RADER and GAJARSA Circuit_Judges
Opinion
RADER Circuit_Judge
On a motion for judgment as a matter of law ( JMOL ) the United_States_District_Court for the Southern_District of New_York upheld the validity of claim 4 of U.S. Patent No._4283,408 ( the '408_patent ) in favor of Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. and Merck & Co. Inc. ( collectively Yamanouchi )
See Yamanouchi Pharm Co. v. Danbury Pharmacal Inc. 21_F.Supp.2d_366 370 48_USPQ2d_1741 1744 ( S.D.N.Y.1998 )
The district_court also found that defendants Danbury Pharmacal Inc. ( Danbury ) Schein_Pharmaceutical Inc. ( Schein ) and Marsam_Pharmaceuticals Inc. ( Marsam ) willfully infringed the '408_patent and awarded attorney_fees to Yamanouchi
See id.at 378
Because the district_court correctly upheld the validity of the '408_patent and did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney_fees this court affirms

I
The '408_patent issued to Yamanouchi on August 11 1981 relates to inhibitors of gastric acid secretion
Claim 4 of the '408_patent the only claim at issue claims famotidine for treating heartburn and ulcers
Famotidine belongs to a class of compounds known as histamine2 antagonists ( H2_antagonists ) which inhibit production of stomach acid
As Figure 1 illustrates the general chemical structure of H2_antagonists includes a `` substituted heterocycle '' group a `` alkyl containing '' chain ( called a `` bridge '' ) and a `` polar tail '' connected in that order :

?
Figure 1* -- -- Famotidine
During the 1960s and 70s drug manufacturers searched for H2_antagonists with improved pharmacological properties including low toxicity high activity and lack of side effects
Research revealed hundreds of thousands of potential compounds
Indeed pharmaceutical companies synthesized more than 11,000 H2 antagonist compounds
See Yamanouchi 21 F.Supp.2d at 371
Very rarely however were these compounds pharmacologically suitable H2_antagonists
Notable failures include tiotidine which caused cancer in rats ; burimamide which was ineffective for oral dosing ; metiamide which caused white blood cell loss ; lupitidine which caused pre-cancerous lesions in rats ; and oxmetidine which caused hepatitis

Of the 11,000 candidates for suitable compounds fewer than fifty showed enough promise to warrant human clinical trials
Ultimately the FDA approved only *1342 four for consumer use : cimetidine,1 ranitidine,2 famotidine,3 and nizatidine.4 Famotidine the claimed compound at issue has been extremely successful
In 1996 for example prescription sales of famotidine in the United States alone reached over 690 million dollars

Danbury is a subsidiary of Schein which produces and markets generic_drugs
In January 1997 Danbury filed an Abbreviated_New_Drug_Application ( ANDA ) with the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) seeking approval to market generic famotidine
Under the ANDA procedure an applicant seeks FDA_approval to market a generic_drug
The Hatch-Waxman Act also known as The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act Pub.L
No._98-417 98_Stat._1585_(1984) ( codified as amended at 21 U.S.C.¡± 355_and_35 U.S.C.¡± 271 ( e ) ( 1994 ) ) amended the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act ( FDCA ) Pub.L
No._52-675 52_Stat._1040_(1938) ( codified as amended at 21 U.S.C.¡±¡± 301-397 ( 1994 ) ) to permit filing of an ANDA to expedite FDA_approval of a generic_version of a drug previously approved by the FDA
See e.g. Bayer AG v. Elan Pharm
Research Corp. 212_F.3d_1241 1244 54_USPQ2d_1711 1712 ( Fed.Cir.2000 )

Under the FDCA an ANDA filer must certify one of the following four statements concerning the previously approved drug : it is not patented ( paragraph I certification ) its patent has expired ( paragraph II certification ) its patent soon will expire on a specified date ( paragraph III certification ) or its patent `` is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture use or sale of the new drug '' covered by the ANDA ( paragraph_IV_certification )
See 21 U.S.C.¡± 355 ( j ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ( vii ) ( I ) - ( IV )
To obtain approval of an ANDA the FDCA requires only that the generic_drug is the `` bioequivalent '' of the previously approved drug
See 21 U.S.C.¡± 355 ( j ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ( iv )

In Danbury 's ANDA for famotidine Danbury made a paragraph_IV_certification that claim 4 of the '408_patent is invalid
See 21 U.S.C.¡± 355 ( j ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ( vii ) ( IV )
As the statute requires Danbury on March_26,_1997 sent Yamanouchi a Patent Certification Notice Letter
This certification_letter informed Yamanouchi of Danbury 's paragraph IV ANDA filing
Accompanying the certification_letter were affidavits from Drs
Bernard Loev and John K. Siepler supporting Danbury 's invalidity certification
The Notice Letter contained as the statute requires an analysis of the prior art and the reasons for the asserted invalidity

Within forty-five days of receiving the certification_letter Yamanouchi filed suit against Danbury alleging infringement of the '408_patent under 35 U.S.C.¡± 271 ( e ) ( 2 ) ( A ) and willful infringement under 35 U.S.C.¡± 285 ( 1994 )
See 35 U.S.C.¡± 271 ( e ) ( 4 )
During this period Marsam filed a number of paragraph IV ANDAs seeking FDA_approval to market injectable versions of famotidine
Yamanouchi then filed suit against Marsam and the two suits were consolidated ( Danbury Schein and Marsam are hereinafter collectively referred to as Danbury )
The parties agreed to a bench trial

After Danbury presented its last witness on obviousness Yamanouchi moved for JMOL under Fed.R.Civ.P
52 ( c ) ( Rule 52 ( c ) )
With that motion Yamanouchi argued that Danbury had not shown by clear and convincing evidence that claim 4 of the '408_patent would have been obvious at the time of invention
The district_court granted Yamanouchi 's JMOL motion
See Yamanouchi 21 F.Supp.2d at 370
Specifically the district_court found that Danbury had not shown any motivation to combine selected portions of various prior art compounds to create the specific compound famotidine and to obtain its extraordinary *1343 properties
See id.at 373
The district_court characterized Danbury 's case for obviousness as largely hindsight speculation and argument without an adequate foundation
See id.at 370 373 376
Based on those findings the district_court determined that Danbury willfully infringed the '408_patent
The district_court thus found the case `` exceptional '' and awarded attorney_fees and costs to Yamanouchi
