* Synopsis
Patent_holder brought action alleging infringement of patents relating to high-speed_chromatography known as `` perfusive '' chromatography
After finding that inventorship was incorrect and denying patent holder 's motion to correct inventorship the United_States_District_Court for the District of Massachusetts Patti B. Saris J. 12_F.Supp.2d_69 on reconsideration vacated denial of motion to correct inventorship and held patents unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct before the Patent and Trademark_Office ( PTO )
Patent_holder appealed
The Court of Appeals Clevenger Circuit_Judge held that : ( 1 ) finding that named inventors intended to deceive PTO was not clearly erroneous ; ( 2 ) falsehoods and omissions to the PTO were material to issue of inventorship ; and ( 3 ) district_court did not abuse its discretion in holding patents unenforceable

Affirmed

CLEVENGER Circuit_Judge
PerSeptive_Biosystems Inc. ( `` PerSeptive '' ) appeals the judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the District of Massachusetts holding PerSeptive 's United States Patents Nos._5019,270 ( `` the '270_patent `` ) 5,228,989 ( `` the '989_patent `` ) and 5,384,042 ( `` the '042_patent `` ) ( collectively `` the patents '' ) unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct before the United States Patent and Trademark_Office ( `` PTO '' )
Because the district_court correctly found that the named inventors of the patents made material misrepresentations regarding inventorship with intent to deceive the PTO during the prosecution of the patents we affirm the holding of inequitable_conduct

I
In 1993 PerSeptive sued Pharmacia_Biotech Inc. Pharmacia_Biotech_AS Sepracor_Inc. Pharmacia_LBK_Biotechnology_AB and Biosepra Inc. ( collectively `` Pharmacia '' ) for patent infringement of the '270 and '989_patent s. In 1995 PerSeptive added a claim for infringement of the '042_patent
All three patents which derived from a single patent application are concerned with high-speed_chromatography or separation of biological materials of a type described by the patents as `` perfusive '' chromatography
The '270_patent claims a method for practicing perfusive_chromatography the '989_patent claims a particle used for perfusive_chromatography and the '042_patent claims a matrix of particles used for perfusive_chromatography
All three patents list the same inventors Dr. Noubar Afeyan Professor Fred Regnier and Dr. Robert Dean

In response to the PerSeptive allegations Pharmacia raised among others the defenses that the patents were invalid for failure to name the correct inventors and that they were unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct practiced by the named inventors during prosecution
In January 1996 the district_court ruled on cross-motions for summary judgment on the *1318 question of whether the patents were invalid for failure to list the correct inventive entity
See PerSeptive_Biosystems Inc. v. Pharmacia_Biotech Inc. No._93-12237 slip op.at 32-33 ( D.Mass
Jan._9,_1996 ) ( `` PerSeptive I `` )
In that decision the district_court concluded that there was `` undisputed clear and convincing_evidence '' that the inventorship was incorrect but declined to hold the patents invalid
The district_court reasoned that Pharmacia had not shown an absence of genuinely disputed facts regarding whether the named inventors had omitted the unnamed_inventors with deceptive_intent thereby precluding the correction of inventorship under the then-current understanding of 35 U.S.C.¡± 256 ( 1994 )
See PerSeptive I slip op.at 31 ( `` [ T ] here remains a disputed issue of fact as to the named inventors ' state of mind preventing the court from ordering the correction of the patent without hearing `` )
Accordingly the court invited PerSeptive to move under section 256 to correct the inventorship of the patents
See id

In March 1997 after a ten-day hearing the district_court denied PerSeptive 's motion to correct inventorship basing its conclusion on a pattern of false statements and misrepresentations by the named inventors to the PTO regarding the inventorship and timing of the invention
See PerSeptive_Biosystems Inc. v. Pharmacia_Biotech Inc. No._93-12237 slip op.at 126 ( D.Mass
Mar._31,_1997 ) ( `` PerSeptive_II `` )

Soon after that ruling the Federal_Circuit decided Stark v. Advanced Magnetics Inc. 119_F.3d_1551 43_USPQ2d_1321_(Fed.Cir.1997)
In Stark this court held that section 256 authorizes correction of inventorship when there is no deceptive_intent on the part of the omitted inventors and does not require inquiry into the intent of the originally-named inventors
Because this holding was contrary to the understanding of the district_court and the parties at the time of the PerSeptive_II decision the district_court in January 1998 reconsidered PerSeptive_II
See PerSeptive_Biosystems Inc. v. Pharmacia_Biotech Inc. 12_F.Supp.2d_69 70 ( D.Mass.1998 ) ( `` PerSeptive_III `` )

In PerSeptive_III the district_court vacated its denial of PerSeptive 's section 256 motion concluding that no evidence had been introduced relating to the intent of the unnamed_inventors
See id. at 71
The court did however `` reexamine the legal effect of its factual_findings in PerSeptive_II that [ Pharmacia had ] proven by clear and convincing_evidence that the named inventors made a series of misrepresentations to the [ PTO ] ''
Id. at 71
Adopting all the factual_findings of PerSeptive_II the district_court concluded that the named inventors had committed inequitable_conduct when prosecuting the application that yielded the three patents
See id. at 73
Accordingly the court held that the patents were unenforceable and entered final judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P
