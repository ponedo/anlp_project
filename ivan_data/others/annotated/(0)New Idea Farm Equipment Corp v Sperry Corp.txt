BACKGROUND
A
Development of the Inventions and the Prior Art
New_Idea and Sperry manufacture and sell harvesters windrowers and mower conditioners for the farm industry.1 In the late 1960 's and early 1970 's International Harvester ( IH ) and Hesston Corporation ( Hesston ) both farm equipment manufacturers were active in developing a tractor-drawn mower conditioner that would operate `` outboard '' of the tractor to avoid the tractor 's running over the crop
In developing this harvester the companies also wanted to have a machine that would have flexibility of movement and efficient cutting patterns similar to self-propelled harvesters but less expensive

In 1968_and_1969 Hesston performed a study to begin developing a tractor-drawn harvester which utilized a tongue arched over the header to pull the harvester
Merle Burkhart Hesston 's engineer who continued the study envisioned an arched tongue attached to the frame of the harvester in several locations including the center
It was not until the fall of 1972 that Hesston under the direction of Burkhart finally built and operated a harvester utilizing an arched tongue attached to the center of the harvester frame that embodied the inventions claimed in the patents in suit
During this development period on October 21 1971 Burkhart filed an application for a patent on a pull-type hydraulically-powered forage harvester having a tongue arched over the header and pivoted on the rear frame adjacent to one side ( referred to by the parties as a `` side-pivot '' harvester )
This machine is illustrated by Figs

A prototype of this machine was being field tested by Hesston near Phoenix Arizona on May_8,_1972
George Cicci and Guy Tufts employees of IH saw and inspected the machine and its operation during the field test and conceived the idea of putting the arched tongue in the middle of the harvester so that the harvester could be operated fully outboard on both sides of the tractor
On that spring day in Arizona Cicci and Tufts made a sketch of their invention
Application for a patent on the invention was eventually filed on April_20,_1973 from which two patents issued ( the '811 and '036_patent s )2 These patents were later purchased from IH by a predecessor of New_Idea

The Cicci '811_patent covers a harvester which utilizes an arched tongue i.e. an elongated beam attached on both ends pivotally to hitch the harvester to the tractor so that the harvester can be moved to operate on either side of the tractor
The '036_patent covers a method of harvesting adjacent rows of standing crops by using the harvester
This harvester and its operation are illustrated in Figs
1_and_2 of the '811_patent reproduced below
