United States Court of Appeals Federal Circuit
SHILEY INC. Plaintiff-Appellee v. BENTLEY LABORATORIES INC. Defendant-Appellant
Appeal No._85-2226
| June_16,_1986
Synopsis
In action for infringement of patents relating to high_efficiency_heat_exchanger designed for use with blood_oxygenator the United_States_District_Court for the Central_District of California 601_F.Supp._964 A Wallace Tashima J. entered injunction permanently enjoining manufacturer from further infringing patent claims
On subsequent motion for stay of injunction pending appeal on the merits the United_States_District_Court for the Central_District of California denied the motion
The Court of Appeals 782_F.2d_992 dismissed an appeal
On appeal on the merits Court of Appeals Baldwin Circuit_Judge held that : ( 1 ) the evidence supported jury 's findings that patent_owner had made no misrepresentations or omissions in dealing with Patent and Trademark_Office ; ( 2 ) record supported finding of willful_infringement and award of double_damages and attorney_fees ; ( 3 ) manufacturer was not entitled to new_trial ; and ( 4 ) jury 's finding that no misrepresentation or omission was made in dealings with Patent and Trademark_Office by patent_owner attorney or agent was supported by substantial evidence so that questions on materiality and intent did not arise

Before BALDWIN SMITH and NEWMAN Circuit_Judges
Opinion
BALDWIN Circuit_Judge Shiley Inc. ( Shiley ) sued Bentley_Laboratories Inc. ( Bentley ) for infringement of U.S. Patent Nos._4065,264 ( '264 ) and 4,138,288 ( '288 )
Bentley counterclaimed for a declaration of invalidity unenforceability and non-infringement
The action was tried to a jury and resulted in a verdict for plaintiff on all issues
The special verdict included jury findings that none of the claims in suit was invalid that plaintiff was entitled to recover its lost profits in the amount of $ 17,528,000 that a reasonable royalty is twelve percent ( 12 % ) of the selling price of the accused device that plaintiff did not commit inequitable conduct before the United States Patent and Trademark_Office ( PTO ) and that defendant 's infringement was willful
The court denied defendant 's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict ( JNOV ) treated the jury finding of willful_infringement as merely advisory made an independent finding of willful_infringement and awarded double_damages attorney_fees prejudgment interest and a permanent injunction
A final amended judgment in the amount of $ 44,248,137 was entered against Bentley on March_13,_1985
Shiley Inc. v. Bentley_Laboratories Inc. 601_F.Supp._964 225_USPQ_1013_(C.D.Cal.1985)

Bentley appeals from the trial court 's entry of judgment on the jury verdict and charges the district_court with abuse of discretion in calculating the damage_award based on the issuance date of the '264_patent in doubling the damage_award based on the finding of willful_infringement and in denying Bentley 's motion for new_trial based on prejudicial error
We affirm

Background
The patents in suit relate to a high_efficiency_heat_exchanger designed for use with a blood_oxygenator ( the `` lung '' portion of the heart-lung machine employed during open heart surgery )
The heat_exchanger is used to lower the temperature of the blood prior to and during surgery and then to rewarm the blood to normal temperature
The cooled blood induces a condition called hypothermia characterized by slowed functioning of the vital organs and overall reduced oxygen consumption by the patient
Hypothermia gives the surgeon time to perform a surgical procedure and enhances the patient 's likelihood of survival

The heat_exchanger of this invention can be formed from tubing which has a hollow helical ( spiral ) rib along its length
The tubing is wrapped around a cylinder and then encased in a tight-fitting shell
Heated or cooled water flows through the inside of the tubing while the blood flows along the outside

*1565. ?
*1566 The combination of the rib and the surfaces of the cylinder and shell confines blood flow to a number of small long paths
Temperature control is very efficient due in part to the large heat exchange surface contacted by a relatively small volume of blood

The helically ribbed tubing known by the trade name Turbotec is made of metal
The Shiley patent specifications referred to U.S. Patent Nos
RE24 783_and_3015,355 for methods and apparatus for manufacture of such tubing
Both aluminum and stainless steel are mentioned in the Shiley_patents as possible materials for construction of the tubing
Stainless steel is compatible with a blood environment but is expensive and has poor heat conductivity
Aluminum is toxic to human blood but has good heat conductivity and is relatively inexpensive
The Shiley_patents disclosed that the toxic properties of aluminum may be overcome by application of a thin coating of polyurethane

An alternative form of the tubing may have a series of individual ring-like ribs
The claims that refer to this type of tubing are 7 8 19_and_24 of the '288_patent and are referred to as the bellows claims
The district_court held that these claims were not in suit because no evidence was presented that defendant was making an oxygenator according to these claims

The heat_exchanger may be mounted within a blood chamber separate from the blood_oxygenator or incorporated within the oxygenator
The preferred embodiment of both Shiley_patents the Shiley product ( S-100 ) and Bentley 's accused device ( BOS-10 ) all have the heat_exchanger located within the mixing chamber of a bubble_blood_oxygenator
A bubble_blood_oxygenator uses a device such as a sparge tube to introduce fine bubbles of oxygen and other gases into the blood
What actually travels through the heat_exchanger is blood foam not ordinary blood and a subsequent defoaming step is required
During prosecution of the Shiley_patents the applicant demonstrated to the satisfaction of the examiner that the placement of this particular heat_exchanger within the mixing tank of a bubble oxygenator results in enhanced blood-gas transfer
