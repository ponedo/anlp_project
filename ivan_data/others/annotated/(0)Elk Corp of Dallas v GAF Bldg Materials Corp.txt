Opinion
PLAGER Circuit_Judge
The question in this design_patent case is whether U.S._Patent No
Des
344,144 ( the '144_patent ) is unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct in its prosecution
The district_court so held.1 Because the district_court did not abuse its discretion in holding the '144_patent unenforceable we affirm

BACKGROUND
Elk Corporation of Dallas ( Elk ) brought a patent infringement action against defendants GAF Building Corporation of America Building_Materials_Corporation of America Building_Materials_Corporation of America_d/b/a GAF_Materials_Corporation and GAF_Materials_Corporation ( collectively GAF ) alleging that GAF infringed Elk 's '144_patent
GAF counterclaimed by filing for a declaratory judgment that Elk 's design_patent is unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct by the patent applicants and their patent_attorney in the prosecution of the patent

Elk and GAF are manufacturers of roofing_shingles
In 1975 GAF obtained a patent U.S._Patent_No._3921,358 ( the Bettoli_patent ) for two-ply composite_roofing_shingles which are often referred to as `` laminated shingles ''
GAF granted licenses under the Bettoli_patent to many manufacturers including Elk to manufacture and sell two-ply composite_roofing_shingles
In the late 1980s four inventors some of whom were Elk employees began developing a two-ply composite roofing shingle based on the Bettoli_patent that utilized striations of shading to simulate the appearance of depth

In anticipation of applying for a design_patent on the new shingle Casimir Weaver one of the inventors arranged for a patentability search on the newly developed roofing shingle
In his letter requesting the search Mr._Weaver acknowledged the similarity of the new design to the shingles disclosed in the Bettoli_patent : The enclosed sketch describes this [ new ] product 's appearance
This shingle 's construction is similar to the one described in Bettoli 's patent No._3921,358 which is also enclosed

A search was made and Mr._Weaver was sent a search_report
One of the patents discussed in the search_report was U.S._Patent No._2036,329 ( the Giles_patent )
After reviewing the search_report Mr._Weaver wrote a memo to a co-inventor pointing out that the Giles_patent was `` [ o ] f special interest ''
The search_report and Mr._Weaver 's memo were forwarded to a patent_attorney at Baker & Botts L.L.P.2

*30 During the prosecution of the '144_patent a number of prior_art_patents covering different shingles or parts of shingles including U.S._Patent
No
Des
309,027 ( the Noone_patent ) U.S._Patent_No._3613,328 ( the Morgan_patent ) and U.S._Patent
No._2253,652 ( the Ritter_patent ) were disclosed to the Patent and Trademark_Office ( PTO )
Neither the Noone_patent the Morgan_patent nor the Ritter_patent made mention of either the Bettoli_patent or the Giles_patent
The Bettoli and Giles_patents themselves were never disclosed to the PTO despite the fact that it was the standard practice of the patent_attorney who completed the prosecution of the '144_patent to disclose all of the prior_art cited in a search_report
In contrast during the prosecution of a continuation of the '144_patent both the Bettoli and Giles_patents were disclosed to the PTO

In its counterclaim GAF alleged that the applicants had committed fraud on the PTO by various means including by intentionally withholding the Bettoli and Giles_patents and by proffering arguments to the examiner during the prosecution of the '144_patent that could not have been made had the Bettoli and Giles_patents been disclosed
In addition GAF alleged that the applicants had intentionally withheld their knowledge of a commercialized Bettoli-type shingle known as the GS_High_Sierra
The district_court found inter alia that the Bettoli and Giles_patents and information about the GS_High_Sierra were material that the applicants had knowledge of the materiality of the patents and information and that they withheld the patents and information from the PTO with an intent to deceive
See Elk Corp. v. Building Materials Corp. No._3 :94-CV-0249-P slip op.at 10 14 27-28 1997_WL_796004_(N.D.Tex._Oct._10,_1997)
In addition the district_court found that in order to overcome an initial rejection the applicants had made arguments concerning the prior_art cited by the examiner that could not have been made had they disclosed the far more material Bettoli and Giles_patents
See id.at 20
In light of all the circumstances the district_court concluded that the applicants ' conduct was so culpable that Elk 's '144_patent should not be enforced
See id.at 28
Elk appeals the district_court 's final judgment against it
