DONNELLEY & SONS COMPANY Defendant-Appellee
No._95-1101
| Sept._14,_1995
Synopsis
Patentee for color printing method using two colors of ink brought infringement action against defendant producer of telephone_directories
The United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of Illinois George W. Lindberg J. granted summary_judgment for defendant and patentee appealed
The Court of Appeals Lourie Circuit_Judge held that : ( 1 ) patentee was estopped by prosecution_history from asserting infringement by any process that did not involve sequential interposition of colored filters and ( 2 ) defendant 's method did not infringe patent

BACKGROUND
Color images in magazines books and newspapers are conventionally formed by a process that uses four printing_plates and the four `` process '' inks ( cyan magenta yellow and black )
In this process four films or `` separations '' are first made by scanning an original_color_image with an electronic scanner or by photographing the image through different colored filters.1 Once the separations are prepared they are used to make four printing_plates each one corresponding to a process ink color
When used in combination the printing_plates generate a four-color image which to the naked eye appears to encompass the entire spectrum of colors and shades

For certain printing applications such as the printing of telephone_directories newspapers and advertising flyers the conventional four-color separation process is prohibitively expensive due to the need to prepare and use four printing_plates
The invention disclosed and claimed in U.S. Patent 4,554,241 2 addresses this problem by providing a process for printing color_images on paper using only two printing_plates and two `` non-process '' inks
Wallace Edwards is the inventor of this process and the chairman and chief executive officer of Mark_I. Edwards assigned his rights in the invention to Mark_I.3

The '241_patent discloses a process in which each of two printing_plates is created by sequentially making two different filter exposures of an original_color_image on a separation_film
The first_printing_plate which prints red ink is made by sequentially exposing a separation_film through green and blue_filters
The second plate which prints another non-process ink such as green blue or black ink is made by sequentially exposing a separation_film through red and blue_filters
Claim 1 of the patent which is the focus of this litigation defines the invention as follows : 1
A method of printing on a sheet_member a realistic reproduction of a colored original utilizing a minimum of two different superimposed_impressions each with a different coloring medium comprising : ( a ) providing a colored original ( b ) creating a first_printing_plate intended to print a non-process red color by
( 1 ) making a green filter exposure of the original on a first_means for recording a first optical image ( 2 ) making a blue_filter_exposure of the original on said first_means steps ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) being carried out sequentially in any order ( c ) creating a second printing plate intended to print a second color different from that printed by said first plate by
*288 ( 3 ) making a red filter exposure of the original on a second_means for recording a second optical image ( 4 ) making a blue_filter_exposure of the original on said second_means steps ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) being carried out sequentially in any order steps ( b ) and ( c ) being carried out in any order ( d ) providing a sheet_member to receive two superimposed_impressions and
( e ) using said first and second printing_plates to print said red color and said different color respectively as the said superimposed_impressions on said sheet_member [ emphasis added ]

The patent specification indicates that either photographic or scanning techniques may be used to carry out the invention : Each film is exposed sequentially through the two filters or with the equivalent two lights on [ a ] conventional scanner
...
It is emphasized again that the interposition of actual colored filters between the original and a means for recording an optical image ( such as a piece of film ) is not the only way to create the appropriate printer
The presently available scanner machines accomplish the same_effect by illuminating the original with light of a particular color
In the.. claims reference is made to `` making a.. filter exposure '' etc. and it is to be understood that this wording is intended to embrace those techniques which do not actually require a physical filter to be interposed but which achieve exactly the same_effect as if the filter had been interposed

Donnelley is in the business of producing Yellow Pages telephone_directories
It prints color_images for its directories using a commercially available Crosfield scanner and two non-process inks
The scanner focuses a single beam of white light on a small area ( a `` pixel '' ) of the colored original
The light reflects back into the scanner where it is split into three separate light beams
The beams are then simultaneously filtered through red green and blue_filters within the scanner
Next the scanner senses the intensities of the beams and converts this information into digital values which are stored in memory
The scanner repeats this process for each pixel until the entire image has been scanned
To create separations the scanner analyzes the stored data to determine the size and density of the various ink dots needed to replicate each pixel 's color
It then converts the data into electrical impulses sends the impulses to light_sources ( lasers or lamps ) and pulses the light_sources to expose tiny spots on separation_films
Each spot of film is either exposed only once or is not exposed at all
The resulting separations are used to make printing_plates which in turn are used to print images in Donnelley 's telephone_directories

Mark_I sued Donnelley alleging infringement of the '241_patent4 Donnelley denied the allegation and moved for summary_judgment of noninfringement arguing that it did not literally infringe the patent because it did not use filters sequentially or make sequential exposures of film
In addition Donnelley argued that its process was known and used before the '241 invention and therefore that the doctrine of equivalents was not applicable
See Wilson Sporting Goods Co. v. David Geoffrey & Assoc. 904_F.2d_677 684 14_USPQ2d_1942 1948 ( Fed.Cir.1990 ) ( `` [ S ] ince prior art always limits what an inventor could have claimed [ during prosecution ] it limits the range of permissible equivalents of a claim `` )
Donnelley further argued that prosecution_history_estoppel_precludes_Mark_I from establishing infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
In response Mark_I essentially conceded that Donnelley did not literally infringe the '241_patent but argued that genuine issues of material_fact precluded summary_judgment in Donnelley 's favor on Mark_I 's theory of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents

*289 The district_court referred Donnelley 's motion to a magistrate_judge who issued a Report and Recommendation on June_10,_1994
The magistrate_judge determined that prosecution_history estoppel precluded Mark_I from proving infringement under the doctrine of equivalents and thus recommended that the court grant summary_judgment of noninfringement
The district_court deciding the motion independently granted summary_judgment on a different ground
The court determined that Mark_I did not refute Donnelley 's factual assertion that the accused process was in the prior art and thus that it could not infringe the patent under the doctrine of equivalents
The court found that Mark_I through the affidavit of its expert had only asserted that the '241_patent was not invalid even though Donnelley never challenged the patent 's validity
Thus in the court 's view Mark_I failed to raise a genuine issue of material_fact concerning Donnelley 's theory of noninfringement
In granting summary_judgment the court found it unnecessary to determine whether prosecution_history estoppel precluded Mark_I from establishing infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
This appeal followed
