Opinion
GAJARSA Circuit_Judge Alza_Corp. ( `` Alza '' ) appeals from the district_court 's judgment after a bench trial of noninfringement and invalidity of claims 1-3 11 13_and_14 of U.S. Patent No._6124,3551 ( `` the '355_patent `` ) in favor of Mylan Laboratories Inc. and Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. ( collectively `` Mylan '' )
Alza_Corp. v. Mylan Labs. Inc. 388_F.Supp.2d_717 ( N.D.W.Va.2005 ) ( `` Alza II `` )
The infringement arose from Mylan 's filing of two Abbreviated New Drug Applications ( `` ANDAs '' ) for a generic_version of the once-a-day extended release formulation of the anti-incontinence drug oxybutynin id.at 720 which Alza has been marketing as Ditropan XLTHE_R
Id.at 738
This court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
For the reasons stated below we affirm the district_court 's judgment of noninfringement and invalidity

I
BACKGROUND
This litigation arose from Mylan 's and Impax 's filings of ANDAs for once-daily controlled-release oxybutynin formulations
Oxybutynin is a drug used to treat urinary incontinence
Once-a-day dosing provides the usual benefits of convenience steady-dosing and in addition possibly reduced absorption of a metabolite that leads to side-effects
Claim 2 of the '355_patent is representative
2
A sustained-release oxybutynin formulation for oral administration to a patient in need of treatment for urge_incontinence comprising a therapeutic dose of an oxybutynin selected from the group consisting of oxybutynin and its pharmaceutically acceptable salt that delivers from 0_to_1 mg in 0_to_4 hours from 1 mg to 2.5 mg in 0_to_8 hours from 2.BIG_TOKEN__75_to_4__BIG_TOKEN25 mg in 0_to_1 4 hours and 3.75 mg to 5 mg in 0_to_24 hours for *1289 treating urge_incontinence in the patient
col._17,_ll._31-38 ( emphasis added )

The district_court construed the '355_patent claims in its Markman Order reported at Alza_Corp. v. Mylan Labs. Inc. 349_F.Supp.2d_1002_(N.D.W.Va.2004) ( `` Alza I `` )
The court construed the word `` deliver '' to refer to the rate of in vivo release in the gastrointestinal ( `` GI '' ) tract
See id.at 1019

Alza did not present direct evidence that Mylan 's ANDA formulation released drug in the GI tract at the rates claimed by the '355_patent
However it did offer two other types of evidence : 1 ) the rate at which the generic product released oxybutynin in an in vitro dissolution apparatus and 2 ) the rate at which the ANDA product resulted in the accumulation of oxybutynin in the bloodstream

The district_court found that Alza had failed to meet its burden of proof on infringement
The district_court also found the asserted claims of the '355_patent to be invalid as both anticipated and obvious in light of the prior art
For the reasons stated below we affirm the invalidity holding on obviousness grounds and consequently we do not need to reach Alza 's arguments regarding anticipation
We also affirm the holding of noninfringement
