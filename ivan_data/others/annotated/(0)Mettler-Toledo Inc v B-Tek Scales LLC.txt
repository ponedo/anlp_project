Before BRYSON MOORE and REYNA Circuit_Judges
Opinion
MOORE Circuit_Judge Mettler-Toledo Inc. ( Mettler ) filed suit accusing B-Tek Scales LLC ( B-Tek ) of infringing claims of U.S. patent nos._4815,547 ( ¡¬547_patent ) and 4,804,052 ( ¡¬052_patent )
After the district_court construed the claims a jury determined that the claims of the ¡¬547_patent were not infringed and that the claims of the ¡¬052_patent were both not infringed and invalid
Mettler appeals the district_court 's denial of Judgment as a Matter of Law ( JMOL ) for each of these determinations
Because the district_court correctly construed the claims of the ¡¬547_patent and because substantial_evidence supports the jury 's verdict of invalidity of the ¡¬052_patent we affirm

Cross-Appellant B-Tek appeals the district_court 's denial of sanctions for alleged withholding and destruction of relevant documents
Because the district_court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the documents were not highly relevant and that there was little harm to B-Tek we affirm

BACKGROUND
The ¡¬547 and ¡¬052_patent s relate to technology for weighing_objects such as large_commercial_trucks
The ¡¬547_patent describes an individual load cell that is one of several cells used in a scale
The cell produces an electrical signal in response to being deformed by an external force such as an object to be weighed
The ¡¬052_patent describes a system and method for measuring the weight of moveable objects on a scale
Specifically the patent discloses a system for correcting weight measurements based on the location of objects on a scale
For example an object placed at one end of a scale may exert more pressure on the weight sensors positioned at that end than an identical object *1294 placed in the center
The ¡¬052_patent describes correcting for this load_position so that the same total weight will be determined regardless of the placement of the object

Mettler sued B-Tek alleging infringement of certain claims of the ¡¬547 and ¡¬ 052 patents
The district_court construed the claims and the case proceeded to trial where the jury found that B-Tek did not infringe any of the asserted claims of the ¡¬547 and ¡¬052_patent s. The jury also determined that the asserted claims of the ¡¬052_patent would have been obvious
Mettler filed a motion for JMOL on both the infringement and invalidity issues which the court denied
Mettler appeals the district_court 's denial of its motion for JMOL for both patents
B-Tek cross appeals the district_court 's denial of sanctions
We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
