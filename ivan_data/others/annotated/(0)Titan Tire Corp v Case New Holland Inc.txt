Before NEWMAN PLAGER and GAJARSA Circuit_Judges
Opinion
PLAGER Circuit_Judge
In this design patent case in which the patentee sought a preliminary_injunction we first clarify the requirements for such an injunction
We then determine in light of that clarification and the evidence before the trial_court whether that court was correct in denying the sought-for relief
Because we conclude that under the applicable legal standard the trial_court did not abuse its discretion in denying the injunction we affirm

BACKGROUND
Appellant The Goodyear_Tire & Rubber_Company ( `` Goodyear '' ) owns U.S. Design Patent No._360862 ( `` the ¡¬862_patent `` ) which claims a design for a tractor_tire
Appellant Titan Tire Corporation ( `` Titan '' ) is a licensee with the right to enforce the ¡¬862_patent
Figure 1 of the ¡¬862_patent is a perspective view of a tractor_tire showing the claimed design :

*1375 FIG-1
In February 2007 Goodyear and Titan ( collectively `` Titan '' ) filed a complaint for patent infringement against Appellee Case New Holland Inc. ( `` Case '' ) in the United_States_District_Court for the Southern_District of Iowa
Titan alleged that Case sells backhoes equipped with tires that infringe the ¡¬ 862 patent

In May 2007 Titan filed a motion for a preliminary_injunction to prohibit Case from selling backhoes with infringing tires
After the trial_court held a hearing on the motion Titan filed an amended complaint adding Appellees CNH America LLC ( `` CNH '' ) and GPX_International_Tire_Corporation ( `` GPX '' ) as defendants
The addition of CNH apparently was in response to the statement in Case 's answer that CNH not Case is the corporate entity that sells backhoes in the United States
GPX is the manufacturer of the `` Easy Rider '' model tire that allegedly infringes the ¡¬862_patent

The trial_court denied Titan 's motion for a preliminary_injunction
Titan Tire Corp. v. Case New Holland Inc. No._4 :07-CV-00063 2007_WL_2914513 ( S.D.Iowa Oct. 3 2007 ) ( `` Preliminary Injunction Order `` )
The court found Titan was likely to succeed in showing infringement and was likely to withstand Case 's challenge to the validity of the ¡¬862_patent on the ground that the design is primarily functional but that Titan was not likely to withstand Case 's challenge to the patent 's validity on obviousness_grounds
While finding that the other three preliminary_injunction factors-irreparable harm balance of the hardships and public interest-weighed in favor of granting an injunction the trial_court concluded that Titan 's failure to establish a likelihood of success on the validity issue was sufficient to defeat the motion for a preliminary_injunction
Since the trial_court concluded that a preliminary_injunction should not issue on the record before it the court determined that it was unnecessary to decide whether an injunction would be proper against CNH and GPX the parties added to the case after the trial_court 's hearing on the motion

Titan appeals from the trial_court 's denial of its motion for a preliminary_injunction
We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1292 ( c ) ( 1 )
