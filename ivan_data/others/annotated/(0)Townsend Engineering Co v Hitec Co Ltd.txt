Synopsis
Action was brought for patent infringement
The United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of Illinois Milton I. Shadur J. found no infringement and appeal was taken
The Court of Appeals Friedman Circuit_Judge held that : ( 1 ) accused 's sausage-stuffing machine did not literally infringe patent and ( 2 ) prosecution_history estoppel precluded patentee from relying on doctrine of equivalents

Opinion
*1087 FRIEDMAN Circuit_Judge
This is an appeal from a judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of Illinois granting summary_judgment for the defendant in a patent infringement suit
The court found that there was no infringement either literal or under the doctrine of equivalents
We affirm

I
The invention the patent ( No._3694,853 ) ( the '853_patent ) discloses is a sausage-stuffing machine
This case involves the `` looper_horn '' claimed in the '853_patent which loops stuffed sausages on hooks for further processing

The appellant Townsend Engineering Company ( Townsend ) obtained the '853_patent by assignment from its inventor Charles Austin Greider
Townsend also owned an earlier and now expired U.S. Patent ( No._3191,222 ) ( the '222_patent ) on a sausage-stuffing machine issued to its chief executive officer Ray T. Townsend

Encasing machines made according to the '222_patent had difficulty handling delicate casing material because of the shape of the machines ' looper_horn
In his specification in the '853_patent Greider explained that he could avoid the tearing problems encountered in machines manufactured under the '222_patent by changing the shape and geometry of the looper_horn : The horn_extension shown in U.S. Pat
No._3191,222 is helical or spiral in shape whereas the horn_extension of the present_invention is substantially straight and disposed at an angle with respect to the rotational_axis of the bearing_means ( horn base 202 ) which supports the horn_extension

The application for the '853_patent originally included 27 claims
Claim 27 of the application which as amended is now claim 5 of the '853_patent the claim covering the looper_horn is the only claim relevant in this appeal
In pertinent part claim 27 set forth
an elongated_tube-like_horn_extension having first and second ends and a longitudinal base [ sic : bore ] extending therethrough for slidably receiving said casing said first_end of said horn_extension being adapted to receive said casing ; bearing_means on said support having an axis of rotation and rotatably supporting said first_end of said horn_extension the longitudinal_axis of said horn_extension being substantially straight and forming an angle with respect to said axis of rotation of said bearing_means..

In the first Office Action the patent_examiner rejected claim 27 as anticipated by the looper_horn of the '222_patent
See 35 U.S.C.¡± 102 ( 1982 )
In response Greider cancelled claim 27 and substituted claim 30 which ultimately became claim 5 of the '853_patent
The most significant differences between claim 30 and claim 27 relate to the shape and length of the looper_horn
The relevant portion of claim 30 is reproduced below with underlining and brackets showing the language added to and deleted from claim 27 : an elongated_tube-like_horn_extension having first and second_end_portions [ ends ] and a [ longitudinal ] bore extending therethrough and therebetween for slidably receiving said casing [ said first_end of said horn_extension being adapted to receive said casing ] said second_end_portion having a length substantially greater than the length of said first_end_portion bearing_means on said support having an axis of rotation and rotatably supporting said first_end_portion of said horn_extension said second_end_portion having a [ the ] longitudinal_axis [ of said horn_extension ] which is [ being ] substantially straight and which is angularly disposed [ and forming an angle ] with respect to the longitudinal_axis of said first_end_portion and angularly disposed with respect to said axes of rotation of said bearing_means..

In the remarks explaining the substitution of claim 30 for claim 27 Greider noted that the looper_horn of the application differed from that in the '222_patent because the latter was both curved and rotating : *1088 In the specification [ Greider ] recognized that looping horns such as the one disclosed in the [ '222_patent ] have been previously used for looping link casings but it was specifically stated at page 18 of the specification that previous horns have not been adapted to handle delicate casings satisfactorily
The horn_extension shown in the [ '222 ] patent is helical or spiral in shape whereas the horn_extension of the present_invention is substantially straight and disposed at an angle with respect to the rotational_axis of the bearing_means which supports the horn_extension
The result of the device described in claim 30 is that the casings are gently swung back and forth for looping over the hooks of the conveyor
This action is gentler and less likely to cause tearing of the casing than the action obtained from the previous helical horn

With these changes claim 30 was issued as claim 5 of the '853_patent

Townsend filed the present suit against appellee HiTec Co. Ltd. ( HiTec ) alleging that HiTec 's `` Auto_Wienker '' sausage-stuffing machine infringed claim 5 of the '853_patent
The patented and accused looper_horns are illustrated below :

?
HiTec moved for summary_judgment of non-infringement asserting that the Auto_Wienker did not infringe either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents
The district_court granted the motion and dismissed the complaint
The court ruled that in order to infringe claim 5 literally HiTec 's looper_horn had to : consist of two parts one part of which is ( 1 ) substantially longer than the other part and ( 2 ) substantially straight
In addition the horn must be rotated by a bearing_means that supports the shorter_part of the horn
Finally the longer part of the horn must be set off at an angle from the shorter_part
Townsend Eng ' g Co. v. HiTec Co. 1_USPQ2d_1987 1989 ( N.D.Ill.1986 )
[ Available on WESTLAW DCT database ]

The district_court noted that unlike the two-part substantially straight horn claimed in the '853_patent the Auto_Wienker 's *1089 horn was `` a one-piece continuously curved plastic tube.. '' Id.at 1989-90
Because it found that `` even a cursory examination of the Auto_Wienker horn establishes it does not truly have any of those crucial properties of the [ looper_horn disclosed in the '853_patent ] '' the court determined that there was no literal infringement
Id.at 1989 ( emphasis in original )

The court also rejected Townsend 's contention that the accused device infringed under the doctrine of equivalents
The court held that Townsend was barred by the doctrine of prosecution_history estoppel from reading claim 5 to cover a looper_horn like that embodied in the '222_patent : [ Claim 5 of the '853_patent ] was amended after an initial rejection by the patent_examiner
That amendment was necessary to distinguish Claim 5 from material already embraced by the [ '222 ] Patent and therefore found to have been anticipated under 35 U.S.C.¡± 102
Because the looper_horn in the [ '222 ] Patent was curved or spiral Greider was forced to add the limitation that his own looper_horn comprises two parts one of which is longer than and angularly disposed to the shorter_part
Indeed Greider 's attorney emphasized the newlynarrowed description of the looper_horn in the argument that accompanied amended Claim 5
In light of that prosecution_history Townsend is estopped from using the doctrine of equivalents to avoid the specific words of limitation Greider chose to add to Claim 5 to obtain issuance of his patent..
Accordingly Townsend can not argue the curved single-piece Auto_Wienker looper_horn ( an embodiment abandoned in Claim 5 as amended ) is the functional equivalent of the substantially straight two-piece Greider looper_horn.. Id.at 1990-91 ( footnote and citations omitted )
