Plaintiff Solvay S.A. ( `` Solvay '' ) appeals from a judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the District of Delaware in favor of defendant Honeywell International ( `` Honeywell '' )
The district_court held that asserted claim 1 of Solvay 's U.S. Patent No._6730,817 ( `` the ¡¬817_patent `` ) was invalid under 35 U.S.C.¡± 102 ( g ) ( 2 ) ( 2006 )
This was so because engineers working at the Russian Scientific Center for Applied Chemistry ( `` RSCAC '' ) first conceived the invention which was reduced to practice in this country by Honeywell personnel pursuant to the RSCAC 's instructions and did not abandon suppress or conceal it

BACKGROUND
I
The question at the heart of this appeal is when an invention conceived by a foreign inventor and reduced to practice in the United_States qualifies as prior_art *1000 under ¡± 102 ( g ) ( 2 )1 That section provides `` [ a ] person shall be entitled to a patent unless.. before such person 's invention thereof the invention was made in this country by another inventor who had not abandoned suppressed or concealed it ''
35 U.S.C.¡± 102 ( g ) ( 2 )
Although section 102 ( g ) initially was designed for determining priority of invention in interference proceedings it is settled that the section has `` independent significance as a basis for prior_art outside of the interference context ''
Thomson S.A. v. Quixote Corp. 166_F.3d_1172 1175_n._3_(Fed.Cir.1999) ; see also Solvay v. Honeywell International Inc. ( `` Solvay_I `` ) 622_F.3d_1367 1375-76 ( Fed.Cir.2010 )
A patent is invalid under that section if the claimed invention was made in this country by another inventor before the patent 's priority_date
See e.g. Solvay_I 622 F.3d at 1375_n._3 ( describing 1999 amendments to ¡± 102 ( g ) )
Making the invention requires conception and reduction to practice
While conception is the `` formation in the mind of the inventor of a definite and permanent idea of a complete and operative invention '' reduction to practice `` requires that the claimed invention work for its intended purpose ''
Id.at 1376 ( citing Hybritech Inc. v. Monoclonal Antibodies Inc. 802_F.2d_1367 1376 ( Fed.Cir.1986 ) )
It is also necessary that the invention not be suppressed abandoned or concealed
See e.g. Apotex USA Inc. v. Merck & Co. 254_F.3d_1031 1036 ( Fed.Cir.2001 )

Our prior cases have illuminated what is meant by `` made in this country ''
See e.g. Solvay_I 622 F.3d at 1376 ( citing Mycogen Plant Sci. Inc. v. Monsanto Co. 243_F.3d_1316 1331 ( Fed.Cir.2001 ) ; Apotex 254 F.3d at 1036 )
Although the inventors may reside in a foreign country and conceive the invention abroad a reduction to practice made outside the United_States is beyond the scope of ¡± 102 ( g ) ( 2 ) prior_art
In other words ¡± 102 ( g ) ( 2 ) allows conception to occur in another country but in such circumstances requires the work constituting the reduction to practice to be performed in the United_States by or on behalf of the inventor.2 However `` there is no requirement that the inventor be the one to reduce the invention to practice so long as the reduction to practice was done on his behalf '' in the United_States
In re DeBaun 687_F.2d_459 463 ( CCPA 1982 ) ( citing Litchfield v. Eigen 535_F.2d_72 76 ( CCPA 1976 ) )
Consistent with that principle `` [ a ] cts by others working explicitly or implicitly at the inventor 's request will inure to his benefit ''

Here Honeywell contends that the invention was conceived by Russian_inventors outside the United_States and reduced to practice in the United_States by Honeywell *1001 personnel following the Russian_inventors ' instructions before the ¡¬817_patent 's priority_date
It follows argues Honeywell that the invention qualifies as ¡± 102 ( g ) ( 2 ) prior_art
