Synopsis
Background : Patentee of patent for recombinant human blood-clotting proteins brought interfering patents action against competitor to determine priority of invention
Competitor moved to dismiss for lack of interference
The United_States_District_Court for the District of Delaware Sue L. Robinson J. 687_F.Supp.2d_486 granted motion
Patentee appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Lourie Circuit_Judge held that :

expiration of patent following district_court 's judgment did not strip Court of Appeals of jurisdiction over patentee 's appeal ;

patent term extension was not limited to only particular claims of patent but applied to patent as a whole ; and

no interference in fact existed between patentee 's asserted claims competitor 's patents

Affirmed

LOURIE Circuit_Judge
Genetics Institute LLC ( `` Genetics '' ) appeals from the decision of the United_States_District_Court for the District of Delaware dismissing its action under 35 U.S.C.¡± 291 for lack of an interference in fact between certain_claims of its U.S. Patent 4,868,112 ( the `` ¡¬112_patent `` ) and certain_claims of U.S
Patents 6,228 620_and_6060,447 ( the `` ¡¬620_patent `` and the `` ¡¬447_patent `` ; collectively the `` Novartis patents '' )
Novartis asserts that the expiration of the ¡¬112_patent following the district_court 's entry of judgment renders us without jurisdiction over Genetics ' appeal
Novartis also asserts that the district_court lacked jurisdiction over certain *1294 claims of the ¡¬112_patent because its term extension under 35 U.S.C.¡± 156 applied only on a claim-by-claim basis
Because the district_court did not err in dismissing Genetics ' ¡± 291 action for lack of an interference in fact and because we disagree with Novartis 's jurisdictional arguments we affirm

BACKGROUND
I
The district_court 's opinion summarizes the science underlying the patented technology in this case which relates to truncated forms of a protein called Factor_VIII
Genetics Inst. LLC v. Novartis Vaccines & Diagnostics Inc. 687_F.Supp.2d_486 490-92 ( D.Del.2010 )
Factor_VIII is an essential blood-clotting protein that circulates freely in the blood in an inactive state
Factor_VIII becomes activated as part of a chain of reactions called the `` blood-clotting cascade '' which causes the formation of a blood clot to stop bleeding from damaged blood vessels
Defects in the gene encoding Factor_VIII result in hemophilia A a genetic disorder associated with prolonged bleeding

The human Factor_VIII_protein is stabilized in the bloodstream by binding to von Willebrand factor ( `` vWF '' ) a large blood protein that prevents the degradation of Factor_VIII
Id.at 491
If Factor_VIII is not able to form a complex with vWF the half-life of Factor_VIII in plasma is reduced about five-fold
Thus while Factor_VIII retains its procoagulant_activity even without vWF binding the association of Factor_VIII with vWF is critical for the optimal regulation of blood coagulation
In addition a Factor_VIII_protein that can not bind vWF may cause unwanted clots in areas such as heart vessels because unbound Factor_VIII can bind blood platelets even when no injury has been detected

The full-length_Factor_VIII_protein consists of 2,332 amino acid residues-the chemical building blocks of proteins
Id
The protein contains several regions or `` domains '' each of which folds into a three-dimensional structure independent of the others
Factor_VIII contains the following domains : A1 A2 B A3 C1 and C2
The Figure below depicts the locations of these domains in the full-length_Factor_VIII_protein
See Br
of Pl.-Appellant at 9 ; see also Def.-Appellee Br.at 10-11
The `` heavy chain '' or `` A domain '' portion of the protein consists of amino_acids 1_to_740 and contains the A1 and A2 domains as well as two acidic regions known as a1 and a2.1 The B_domain contains amino_acids 741_to_1648
The `` light chain '' or `` C domain '' portion of the protein consists of amino_acids 1649_to_2332
It contains a third acidic region a3 as well as the A3 C1 and C2 domains
The a3_acidic_region of particular importance to the dispute in this case contains amino_acids 1649_to_1689
It is directly adjacent to the B_domain

?
*1295 Treating patients with hemophilia A traditionally involved administering partially purified Factor_VIII derived from porcine or human plasma
In the 1980s however human plasma sources had become contaminated with viruses such as HIV and hepatitis making treatment with plasma-derived Factor_VIII dangerous
Recombinant Factor_VIII produced from DNA cloning offered a safer and more abundant new source of therapeutic material
Scientists raced to clone Factor_VIII successfully for the first time
Yet cloning Factor_VIII proved to be an enormous technical undertaking because the Factor_VIII_protein was nearly ten times larger than any protein previously cloned
The large size of the DNA sequence encoding the full-length_Factor_VIII_protein also complicated the cloning process
Id.at 491-92

Once the feat of cloning the full-length_Factor_VIII_protein was achieved researchers focused their efforts on finding a smaller more easily cloned recombinant protein that mimicked the biological activity of Factor_VIII in humans
Id.at 492
Those efforts formed the basis of the patents at issue in this appeal
As described below scientists discovered that portions of the full-length_Factor_VIII_protein were unnecessary for procoagulant_activity and they designed truncated Factor_VIII_proteins lacking these portions
Scientists further found that the a3_acidic_region of Factor_VIII is responsible for binding to vWF and is therefore critical to Factor_VIII 's performance
