90_F.3d_1576
United States Court of Appeals Federal Circuit
VITRONICS CORPORATION Plaintiff-Appellant v. CONCEPTRONIC INC. Defendant-Appellee
No._96-1058
| July_25,_1996
Synopsis
Patentee brought action against competitor alleging infringement of its patented method for reflow_soldering of surface mounted devices to printed circuit_boards
The United_States_District_Court for the District of New_Hampshire Martin F. Loughlin J. entered judgment in favor of competitor and patentee appealed
The Court of Appeals Michel Circuit_Judge held that : ( 1 ) `` solder_reflow_temperature '' within meaning of patent meant peak reflow temperature rather than `` liquidus temperature '' and ( 2 ) trial_court erred in relying on expert testimony in interpreting claim

Reversed and remanded

Opinion
MICHEL Circuit_Judge
Vitronics Corporation ( `` Vitronics '' ) appeals the September 27 1995 order of the United_States_District_Court for the District of New_Hampshire Civil Action No._91-696- L entering judgment as a matter of law that Vitronics did not prove that Conceptronic Inc. ( `` Conceptronic '' ) infringed claim 1 of U.S. Patent No._4654,502 ( `` the '502_patent `` )
The appeal was submitted for decision after oral argument on May_8,_1996
Because we conclude that the specification of the '502_patent dictates a claim interpretation in accordance with the plaintiff 's proposed construction and that so construed the '502_patent may have been infringed we reverse the trial_court 's decision and remand for further proceedings

BACKGROUND
The Patented Invention
Vitronics and Conceptronic both manufacture ovens used in the production of printed *1579 circuit_boards
The ovens are used to solder electrical devices ( such as resistors capacitors and integrated circuits ) to the boards
Several methods of soldering devices to boards have been developed ; the '502_patent assigned to Vitronics is directed to one of those methods

Specifically the '502_patent is directed to a method for the reflow_soldering of surface mounted devices to a printed circuit_board in which the circuit_board is moved by a conveyor through a multizone oven
In this process a solder paste is placed on the circuit_board and the devices to be soldered ( with attached connectors ) are placed on the paste
The circuit_board is then placed on what is basically a conveyor belt running through an oven and passing through several different heating zones
In the final and hottest zone the solder paste melts and forms a connection between the device and the circuit_board
The boards remain in the last heating zone for only a short duration allowing the solder to reach a temperature high enough to cause the solder to melt and reflow while maintaining the devices themselves below the solder_reflow_temperature
Due to this temperature differential the solder flows up the device connectors to form a solid connection

Claim 1 of the '502_patent the only claim at issue in this appeal reads as follows ( with added emphasis on the disputed terms ) : 1
A method for reflow_soldering of surface mounted devices to a printed circuit_board comprising : moving a printed circuit_board having solder and devices disposed on a surface thereof through a first zone and in close_proximity to a first emitting surface of at least one nonfocused infrared_panel_emitter said first emitting surface being at a first_panel_temperature ; moving said board through a second zone and in close_proximity to a second emitting surface of at least one nonfocused infrared_panel_emitter said second emitting surface being at a second_panel_temperature lower than said first_panel_temperature ; and
moving said board through a third zone and in close_proximity to a third emitting surface of at least one nonfocused infrared_panel_emitter said third emitting surface being at a third panel temperature higher than said second_panel_temperature said third emitting surface heating said board and said solder to a solder_reflow_temperature for a period of time sufficient to cause said solder to reflow and solder said devices to said board while maintaining the temperature of said devices below said solder_reflow_temperature
