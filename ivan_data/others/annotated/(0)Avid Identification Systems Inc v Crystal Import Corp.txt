PROST Circuit_Judge
Avid Identification Systems Inc. ( `` Avid '' ) brought suit against Datamars_SA and its subsidiary Crystal Import Corporation ( collectively `` Datamars '' ) alleging infringement of Avid 's U.S. Patent No._5235,326 ( `` the ¡¬326_patent `` ) directed to a multi-mode radio-frequency_identification_system for reading encoded biocompatible_chips
The patent was found valid and infringed but held to be unenforceable for inequitable_conduct
This appeal challenges the district_court 's finding of inequitable_conduct
In reviewing the district_court 's finding we address which individuals are `` substantively involved '' in the preparation or prosecution of a patent_application and thus owe a duty of candor and good faith to the Patent and Trademark_Office under 37 C.F.R.¡± 1.56
We affirm the finding of the district_court

BACKGROUND
Avid is a small closely held company that designs and markets biocompatible radio frequency identification chips for implantation in animals
Avid markets its chips to pet owners as a way of increasing the chances that an estranged companion animal will be identified and reunited with its family
Avid markets devices for reading its chips to animal hospitals and shelters

Avid 's founder and president veterinarian Dr. Hannis Stoddard testified that he decided to form the Avid corporation after visiting an animal shelter to reclaim his own lost dog
He explained that most animals at the shelter were clearly lost pets but there was no way to find their homes
Dr._Stoddard made it his mission *970 to implement a better system of dealing with the identification and processing of recovered animals
He and a colleague Peter Troesch formed Avid for the purpose of carrying out Dr._Stoddard 's mission

When the company first started Avid purchased unencrypted identification chips from a supplier relabeled them and sold them as a marketer and distributor
The company discontinued its resale business model in around 1985 because Dr._Stoddard wanted Avid to develop its own technology
Specifically Stoddard wanted Avid to develop a chip and reader_system where the reader could read both the unencrypted_chips currently on the market as well as encrypted chips that Avid produced
Stoddard hired at least three engineers Dr. Polish Dr._Malm and Mr. Beigel to carry out this objective
By about 1990 these engineers developed an encrypted identification chip that could be read by a reader programmed with Avid 's decryption code
They also developed a `` multi-mode '' reader that could read both Avid 's encrypted chip and traditional unencrypted_chips

Dr._Stoddard demonstrated some of Avid 's technology at a U.S. Livestock Committee trade show in around April of 1990
In August of 1991 Avid filed for the ¡¬326_patent on a multi-mode encrypted chip and reader_system where the reader can read both unencrypted_chips and Avid 's encrypted chips
The inventors named on the application were Polish Malm and Beigel
Dr._Malm was also listed as the prosecuting attorney
A few days before the patent_application was filed the inventors assigned their rights to Avid
Dr._Stoddard signed the small entity status affidavit filed with the patent
Avid was also pursuing European patent rights for its encrypted chip and reader_system during this time
The ¡¬326_patent issued in August of 1993

Datamars is a competitor of Avid in the companion animal identification chip market
Avid brought suit against Datamars and several other competitors in 2004 alleging infringement of its ¡¬326_patent as well as unfair_competition and false_advertising_claims
The other defendants settled their claims with Avid
The case against Datamars proceeded to trial and a verdict

The jury found the ¡¬326_patent willfully infringed and not invalid and found in favor of Avid on the unfair_competition and false_advertising_claims
The jury awarded Avid $ 26,981 on the patent infringement claim and $ 6 million on the unfair_competition claim
Following the trial Datamars filed a motion to hold the patent unenforceable for inequitable_conduct
The district_court granted the motion without trial finding that Dr._Stoddard 's trade_show_demonstration was material_prior_art under 35 U.S.C.¡± 102 ( b ) and that information regarding the demonstration was withheld from the U.S. Patent and Trademark_Office ( `` PTO '' ) with deceptive intent
Specifically the district_court found that Dr._Stoddard owed a duty of candor to the PTO

After this ruling on inequitable_conduct the parties entered into a settlement_agreement
Pursuant to the terms of the agreement the parties stipulated to a dismissal of all claims other than those related to the ¡¬326_patent the payment for unfair_competition was reduced to $ 3 million Avid filed an unopposed_motion for reconsideration of the district_court 's inequitable_conduct_decision and Datamars agreed not to contest the standing jurisdiction mootness or case and controversy of the inequitable_conduct_decision on appeal to this court
In the event that Avid prevailed on reversing the inequitable_conduct *971 determination on motion for reconsideration or on appeal to this court Datamars agreed to pay the $ 26,981 previously awarded by the jury for infringement of the ¡¬326_patent

The district_court dismissed the unopposed_motion for reconsideration of the inequitable_conduct_decision finding that there was no case or controversy between the parties
The district_court explained that the terms of the settlement_agreement explicitly precluded Datamars from opposing the motion for reconsideration in any way thus eliminating any adversity between the parties on all matters before the district_court
The district_court noted in its opinion that Avid argued for the first time on reconsideration that Dr._Stoddard did not have a duty of candor before the PTO

Avid timely appealed the district_court 's determination of inequitable_conduct to this court
Datamars did not file a brief in response
