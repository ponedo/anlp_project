B.F._Goodrich_Co. v. Aircraft Braking Sys. C.A
Nos._91-48 /91-515-SLR ( D.Del
Nov._10,_1994 )
Because we conclude that the patents are invalid under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103 and that BFG did not engage in inequitable_conduct we affirm

BACKGROUND
BFG is the assignee of the '017 and '895_patent s. The '017_patent is directed to a method of overhauling a disk_brake_assembly
The '895_patent is a division of the '017_patent and contains apparatus claims for a disk_brake_assembly
Both patents are entitled to the benefit of the '017_patent 's July_2,_1984 filing date and thus July_2,_1983 is the critical_date for purposes of 35 U.S.C.¡± 102

The claimed brake_assembly is used in aircraft landing gear wheels
Figure 4 of the patents is a cross-sectional view illustrating the assembly :

?
-- -- - The assembly includes stators 46 positioned between rotors 50
The stators 46 and rotors 50 consist of carbon_disks and are sandwiched between end_plates 48
The rotors 50 are mechanically attached to a rim ( not shown ) on which is mounted a tire so that when the wheel rotates rotors 50 rotate between stators 46
When the brake is activated piston 26 ' applies pressure to one of the two end_plates 48 which in turn forces together the rotors and stators against end plate 44 so that the resulting friction between the rotors and stators stops the wheel
Eventually the carbon_disks become worn through friction and must be replaced since a minimum thickness of the disks is required to absorb the heat generated by the friction and ensure effective braking operation

The invention provides a brake_assembly having alternating thick and thin_disks referred to as a thick/thin assembly consisting of for example thin stators and thick rotors
The disks tend to wear evenly
Accordingly when the thin_disks become worn to the point of requiring replacement the thick_disks are only half worn
Only the original thin_disks are replaced and they are replaced with thick_disks
The process can be repeated and during each maintenance interval only half of the disks are thus replaced

In comparison prior art brake assemblies had disks of uniform thickness
During *1580 prosecution the patentee distinguished its invention over this feature of the prior art brake assemblies
In response to a final rejection of the '017_patent of the ground of obviousness the applicant submitted an affidavit by Wesley S. Perry Director of Engineering for BFG
The following are relevant portions of the Perry affidavit
That.. he has not seen or heard of the brake_construction and method shown and described in the [ BFG_patent_application ] ; That as Director of Engineering he had the responsibility for reading the literature and trade journals on aircraft_brakes and has attended numerous seminars and trade_shows on aircraft_brakes ; That at no time in the literature or at seminars and trade_shows he has attended has the brake_construction and method shown and described in the [ BFG_patent_application ] been suggested ;

.
.
.
.
.
That the common practice in overhauling carbon brakes is to replace all the brake_disks after they are substantially completely worn with full_thickness_disks and that it would not be obvious to replace one set of stators or rotors with a new or refurbished set of full_thickness_disks while the other set is half worn at overhaul intervals shorter than the refurbished interval for the disks as taught and shown in the [ BFG_patent_application ] ;

.
.
.
.
.
That based on his observation and knowledge of the ordinary skilled worker overhauling carbon brakes the ordinary skilled worker would not have found it expedient through routine experimentation to arrange the rotors and stators of a carbon disk brake with different available_wear_portions so that after a predetermined_number of brake_applications said available_wear_portions of a first_group of disks are substantially worn away at an intermediate_overhaul_time and said available_wear_portions of a second_group of disks are not worn away..

In response to the submission of this affidavit the U.S._Patent and Trademark_Office ( PTO ) allowed the application which issued as the '017_patent
The PTO subsequently allowed the divisional application which issued as the '895_patent
Claim 1 of the '017_patent and claim 2 of the '895_patent which are the only independent claims at issue read as follows : 1
A method of assembling and overhauling a disk brake having a plurality of disks with available_wear_portions of predetermined different thicknesses comprising positioning a first_group of said disks in overlapping relationship with a second_group of said disks said first_group of said disks having each of said available_wear_portions of a first_thickness said second_group of said disks having each of said available_wear_portions of a second_thickness said first_thickness of each of said available_wear_portions of said first_group of said disks being less than said second_thickness of each of said available_wear_portions of said second_group of said disks replacing said first_group of said disks with a third_group of said disks at an intermediate_brake_overhaul_time when said available_wear_portions of said first_group are substantially fully worn said available_wear_portions of each of said third_group of said disks having a third thickness greater than the thickness of each of said available_wear_portions of said second_group of said disks at said intermediate_brake_overhaul_time
2
A disk_brake_assembly comprising a first_group of brake_disks and a second_group of brake_disks in axially aligned and interleaved relationship said disks of said first_group being interleaved with said disks of said second_group in alternating relationship each of said disks of said first_group and said second_group having oppositely disposed wear surfaces said wear surfaces on opposite_sides of each brake_disk of said first_group are equal in thickness said wear surfaces on opposite_sides of each brake_disk of said second_group are equal in thickness said wear surfaces of said first_group of said disks having a first_thickness said wear surfaces of said second_group of said disks having a second_thickness said first_thickness of said first_group of said disks being less than said *1581 second_thickness of said second_group of said disks whereby after a predetermined_number of brake_applications the available_wear_thickness of said first_group of said disks are substantially fully worn away at an intermediate_overhaul_time and said available_wear_thickness of said second_group of said disks are not worn away

During prosecution of the patents the PTO was apparently not aware of and hence did not consider a published paper by employees of Dunlop Ltd
This paper entitled The Economic and Safety Aspects of Commercial Aircraft Carbon Brakes [ hereinafter Dunlop ] was presented at the International Federation of Airworthiness Annual Conference in Long Beach California in April 1982
Although several individuals at BFG had copies of Dunlop in their files BFG did not cite it to the PTO during prosecution of the patent applications
Relevant portions of Dunlop describe what is referred to as a 2_for_1 refurbishment scheme in which two worn disks are machined to smoothness and then clipped together to form one `` new '' disk
Dunlop describes how these thicker 2_for_1 disks can be used with new disks : Following brake chassis inspection the heat_stack can either be put back into the brake for the remainder of its life or some of the half worn discs can be assembled with re-furbished discs from other brakes
Because of this arrangement it is possible to use reclaimed discs which are thicker than new discs
In other words during the machining for reclaim [ sic ] the minimum amount of carbon has been machined off in order not to waste any of this expensive material
Individually these extra_thick_discs have a life potential well in excess of 3,000 landings
By the use of this half life inspection routine and by using extra_thick_discs mixed with part worn discs the cost per brake landing can be reduced significantly
Id.at 11
Dunlop also teaches obtaining maximum use of the carbon_disks by building up the heat_stack to fill the space available for the disks by using a combination of new and refurbished disks
Id.at 12

In addition Dunlop describes brake overhaul schedules using the 2_for_1 refurbishment technique
A chart in Dunlop illustrates the overhaul schedules
Aircraft are listed on the left side of the chart and the months from October 1984 through June 1988 are listed across the top of the chart
The chart contains boxes representing a particular overhaul for the corresponding aircraft and month
The chart also contains a description of several overhaul routines the most relevant of which are referred to as overhaul combinations 3_and_5
The description for combination 3 states : `` New stators pressure and thrust stators half worn rotors ''
That for combination 5 states : `` New rotors half worn stators pressure and thrust stators ''
Combinations 3_and_5 therefore together describe an overhaul scheme involving a thick/thin aircraft brake_assembly

BFG also failed to submit to the PTO other prior art that it was aware of during its prosecution of the patents
This prior art included a Concorde manual which describes a brake overhaul method used on the Concorde which was the first commercial aircraft to use carbon disk brakes
According to this method new or partially worn disks were placed in the brake_assembly during overhaul
Thus after use in this manner the carbon_disks in the Concorde brake had varying thicknesses

Other prior art also included U.S._Patent 3,480,115 which describes a brake_assembly having steel disks arranged in descending order of thickness
BFG had itself used brake assemblies with steel rotors of different wear thicknesses

BFG also failed to notify the PTO of certain of its own activities which may have implicated the on-sale bar under 35 U.S.C.¡± 102 ( b )
BFG made a presentation in France to Airbus Industries which has customers in the United States concerning the brake_assembly in January 1983
Later BFG met with representatives of Boeing on March_24,_1983 in Seattle Washington in order to discuss BFG 's carbon brakes
This meeting was part of an ongoing effort by BFG to interest Boeing in its thick/thin carbon aircraft brake assemblies
Even though these activities occurred before the critical_date BFG failed to disclose them to the PTO during prosecution of the '017 and *1582 '895_patent s. Moreover the inventor Lowell D. Bok stated in his invention record which he submitted to a BFG in-house attorney that the BFG thick/thin brake assemblies had been `` proposed for the 757-200 A310-BIG_TOKEN__300_and_767__BIG_TOKEN -300 Aircraft [ ] ''

BFG sued ABS and Allied-Signal separately for infringement of claims 2_and_3 of the '895_patent and claims 1-4 of the '017_patent
Both defendants counterclaimed for a declaratory_judgment of invalidity and unenforceability and the cases were consolidated for discovery and a bench trial
In its memorandum opinion following the trial the district_court held that : ( 1 ) claims 2_and_3 of the '895_patent and claims 1-4 of the '017_patent were invalid under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103 as having been obvious over Dunlop and under 35 U.S.C.¡± 102 ( b ) as having been on sale by virtue of BFG 's activities before the critical_date ; ( 2 ) Allied-Signal infringed claims 2_and_3 of the '895_patent and claims 1-4 of the '017_patent ; ( 3 ) ABS did not infringe any of the asserted claims ; and ( 4 ) BFG did not engage in inequitable_conduct during prosecution of the patents
On appeal BFG challenges the district_court 's decision on validity and on infringement by ABS
On cross-appeal ABS and Allied-Signal challenge the district_court 's holding that BFG did not engage in inequitable_conduct
