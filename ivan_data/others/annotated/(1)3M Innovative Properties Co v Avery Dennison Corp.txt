CLEVENGER Circuit_Judge
Plaintiffs-Appellants 3M_Innovative_Properties_Company and Minnesota_Mining and Manufacturing_Company ( collectively `` 3M '' ) sued Defendant-Appellee Avery Dennison ( `` Avery '' ) for infringement of claim 1 of U.S. Patent No._5897,930 ( `` the ¡¬930_patent `` ) in the United_States_District_Court for the District of Minnesota
After construing disputed claim terms the district_court entered summary_judgment in favor of Avery concluding that Avery did not infringe as a matter of law the ¡¬930_patent either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents
We reverse the district_court 's claim construction vacate its summary_judgment and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion

I
3M and Avery compete in the market for adhesive-based products for the commercial graphics industry
In our increasingly image-suffused world this industry seems to have targeted all available surfaces in public places including the exterior of busses trucks and other vehicles as appropriate locations for advertising images
So that these advertisements may be efficiently and pervasively placed on such diverse surfaces images are pre-printed onto sheets of adhesive-backed film
These films like bumper stickers have release_liners that can be stripped off to reveal a pressure sensitive adhesive just prior to affixation of the image

Even one of skill in the art of sticking films on surfaces can experience difficulties
Correct positioning of a large image may require repeated adjustments and if the film is not initially placed in precisely the desired position removing the film and repositioning it is likely to damage the film and mar the sought-after image
Additionally pockets of air in the form of *1368 bubbles or blisters may become entrapped between the film and the surface if the two are not mated perfectly

The ¡¬930_patent describes a release_liner that according to 3M avoids these positioning and air-entrapment difficulties
Also according to 3M Avery 's EZ Film liner infringes the claims of the ¡¬930_patent in the features it uses to provide these benefits
