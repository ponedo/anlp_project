CANTON BIO-MEDICAL INC. Plaintiff-Appellant v. INTEGRATED LINER TECHNOLOGIES INC. Defendant-Appellee
No._98-1568
| June_30,_2000
Synopsis
Patentee brought infringement action against competitor alleging infringement of its patent covering process for binding `` uncured '' elastomers such as silicone_rubber to polyolefins
The United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of New_York Frederick J. Scullin Jr. J. 19_F.Supp.2d_22 granted summary_judgment of noninfringement and patentee appealed
The Court of Appeals Pauline Newman Circuit_Judge held that prosecution history estoppel barred patentee from asserting infringement by competitor 's process

Affirmed

Opinion
PAULINE NEWMAN Circuit_Judge
Canton Bio-Medical Inc. ( `` Canton '' ) appeals the decision of the United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of New_York,1 granting the motion of Integrated Liner Technologies Inc. ( `` ILT '' ) for summary_judgment of non-infringement of Canton 's United States Patent No._4499,148 under the doctrine of equivalents
The judgment is affirmed

The Patented Invention
Both ILT and Canton manufacture septa which are small disks used as closures for liquid-containing vessels
These septa have perforation and self-sealing properties whereby a needle may be inserted and withdrawn from the vessels without significant contamination or fluid loss
The septa made by ILT and Canton are formed from plastic laminations of a layer of an elastomer such as a silicone_rubber and one or more layers of a polyolefin
The *1369 ¡¬ 148 patent is directed to the process by which these materials which are generally inert and difficult to bond are laminated to form septa having the desired properties

The ¡¬148_patent describes and claims a four-step process wherein the polyolefin_surface is treated with a corona_discharge primed with a specified primer_solution bonded to an uncured elastomer and cured by application of heat while applying pressure to the laminate
By this process a firm bond or `` chemical bridge '' is formed between the polyolefin and the elastomer
Claim 1 is the only claim in suit : 1
A method of chemically bonding elastomeric materials to chemically inert polyolefins the method comprising : [ a ] exposing a chemically inert polyolefin_surface to a corona_discharge treatment [ b ] applying to the corona_discharge treated surface of the polyolefin a primer_solution of ethyl silicate ethyl orthosilicate and tetra butyl titanate in an organic solvent [ c ] placing the treated and primed surface of polyolefin in contact with the surface of an uncured elastomeric_compound of molecular weight above 61,000 with a minimum elongation modulus of fifty percent ; and [ d ] applying heat to the composite material to cure the elastomeric_compound while pressing the polyolefin elastomeric_compound article firmly together whereby upon curing of the elastomeric material the polyolefin will be firmly and securely bonded thereto

In the accused ILT process the polyolefin_surface is also treated with a corona_discharge primed and laminated to an elastomer by treating with heat and application of pressure
ILT states that the patented and the accused processes differ in two ways
First ILT contends that it uses a different chemical primer_solution from that of step [ b ]
Second ILT argues that the bonded elastomeric_compound in ILT 's process is not `` uncured '' as stated in step [ c ] before the treatment with heat and pressure in accordance with step [ d ]

Because of the different chemicals used in the step [ b ] primer_solution Canton agreed that ILT 's process does not literally infringe claim 1
The district court held by summary_judgment that there was no infringement under the doctrine of equivalents based primarily on prosecution history estoppel
We affirm
