asserted_claims in continuation-in-part ( CIP ) application that added language describing vending machine with user_interface located remotely from vending machine such as on user 's laptop were not entitled to effective_filing_date of original_application that claimed user_interface that was part of unitary vending machine ;

expert did not demonstrate at time of filing_date of original_application how applicant was in possession of claimed invention either expressly or inherently ; and

Opinion
MOORE Circuit_Judge PowerOasis Inc. and PowerOasis_Networks LLC ( PowerOasis ) appeal the United_States_District_Court for the District of New_Hampshire 's grant of summary_judgment that claims 15 18 31 35 38 40 and 49 ( asserted_claims ) of U.S. Patent Nos._6466,658 ( '658_patent ) and 6,721,400 ( '400_patent ) are invalid as anticipated under 35 U.S.C.¡± 102 ( b )
In reaching its decision the district_court concluded that none of the asserted_claims of the two patents were entitled under 35 U.S.C.¡± 120 to the benefit of the filing_date of PowerOasis 's original_application because the earlier application did not provide a written description of the invention claimed in the asserted patents as required by 35 U.S.C.¡± 112
We affirm the grant of summary_judgment of invalidity with respect to all asserted_claims

BACKGROUND
The two PowerOasis_patents at issue the ¡¬658_patent and the ¡¬400_patent ( PowerOasis_patents ) are directed to vending machines that sell telecommunications_access
The PowerOasis_patents contain virtually identical specifications
The stated purpose of the PowerOasis_patents is to provide a `` vending machine '' that enables a customer to connect a laptop to a telecommunications channel
The ¡¬658 and ¡¬400_patent s list filing_dates of November 6 2001 and October 15 2002 respectively
The ¡¬658 and ¡¬400_patent s stem from a series of continuation and continuation-in-part applications
The first application in the patent chain ( Original_Application ) was filed on February 6 1997 and ultimately issued as U.S. Patent No._5812,643 ( '643_patent )
PowerOasis does not assert the ¡¬643_patent in this litigation

PowerOasis filed a continuation application on September 18 1998 ( which was later abandoned ) and on June_15,_2000 it filed a continuation-in-part application ( 2000 CIP_Application ) which issued as U.S. Patent No._6314,169 ( '169_patent )
The ¡¬169_patent is not asserted by PowerOasis in this litigation
The 2000 CIP_Application added considerable new language to the specification which the district_court characterized as `` substantial new matter ''
PowerOasis Inc. v. T-Mobile *1302 USA Inc. No._05- cv-42-PB 2007_WL_962937 at *2 ( D.N.H
Mar._30,_2007 )

PowerOasis subsequently filed the two applications that led directly to the two patents asserted in this suit : first the ¡¬658_patent then the ¡¬400_patent
PowerOasis sued T-Mobile for patent infringement alleging that T-Mobile 's wireless `` HotSpot Network '' 1 infringes claims 15 18 31 35 38 40 and 49 of both PowerOasis_patents
Each of the asserted_claims depends from independent claim 1 which is not asserted by PowerOasis
Except for minor variations in the language of the independent claims that do not relate to the issues on appeal the language of the asserted_claims is identical in both PowerOasis_patents
Independent claim 1 recites :

1
A vending machine for vending telecommunications channel access to a customer said vending machine comprising : a payment mechanism for obtaining information from the customer to initiate a vending transaction ; a customer_interface for indicating the status of said vending machine ; an electronic_circuit for determining when the vending transaction is completed ; a telecommunications_channel_access_circuit adapted to be connected to at least one external_telecommunications_channel for enabling access to the at least one external_telecommunications_channel at the beginning of a vending transaction and disabling access at the end of the vending transaction ; a telecommunications channel access connector connected to said telecommunications_channel_access_circuit for enabling connection to an external telecommunications device of the customer ; and
a control unit having a device for receiving payment information from the customer and for controlling said electronic_circuit and said telecommunications_channel_access_circuit
The parties had agreed that `` customer_interface '' is `` an interface that enables information to be passed between a human user and hardware or software components of a system '' but disagreed about the location of the customer_interface
PowerOasis argued that the `` customer_interface '' may occur on a customer 's laptop
T-Mobile argued that the customer_interface must be located on the vending machine itself
Relying entirely on new language added to the 2000 CIP application the district_court adopted PowerOasis 's proposed construction that the claim term `` customer_interface '' encompasses an interface that is located on the customer 's laptop

In light of the district_court 's construction of `` customer_interface '' T-Mobile filed a motion for summary_judgment that the asserted_claims were anticipated by the MobileStar_Network
It is undisputed that prior to June_15,_1999 MobileStar_Networks Inc. ( a company acquired by T-Mobile in 2002 ) developed deployed publicly used and offered for sale the MobileStar_Network which was a high-speed wireless data network that connected users to the Internet
It is also undisputed that prior to June_15,_1999 the MobileStar_Network contained all of the same *1303 features that form the basis of PowerOasis 's allegation that the T-Mobile HotSpot Network infringes its patents
T-Mobile argued therefore that this public use sale and offer for sale more than one year prior to the June_15,_2000 filing_date of the 2000 CIP_Application2 constituted ¡± 102 ( b ) prior art which anticipated the PowerOasis_patents
35 U.S.C.¡± 102 ( b )
PowerOasis responded by claiming its asserted_claims should have the benefit of priority going all the way back to the filing_date of its Original_Application ( February 6 1997 ) which would antedate the MobileStar_Network

On summary_judgment the district_court determined that the asserted_claims were not entitled to the priority date of the Original_Application because the written description of the Original_Application did not support the later issued claims
The district_court noted that to arrive at the broad construction it accorded the `` customer_interface '' it relied `` exclusively '' on the new matter that was added to the 2000 CIP_Application
PowerOasis 2007_WL_962937 at *8
Because the district_court concluded that the ¡¬658 and ¡¬ 400 patents are not entitled to the effective_filing_date of the Original_Application the district_court granted the motion for summary_judgment of invalidity
This appeal followed
