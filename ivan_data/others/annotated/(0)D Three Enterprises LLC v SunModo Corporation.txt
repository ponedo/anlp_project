Opinion
Wallach Circuit_Judge
Appellant D_Three Enterprises LLC ( `` D_Three '' ) sued Appellees SunModo Corporation ( `` SunModo '' ) and Rillito_River_Solar_LLC doing business as EcoFasten_Solar ( `` EcoFasten '' ) ( together `` Appellees '' ) in the U.S. District_Court for the District of Colorado ( `` District_Court '' ) alleging infringement of various_claims of U.S. Patent Nos._8689,517 ( `` the '517_patent `` ) 9,068,339 ( `` the '339_patent `` ) and 8,707,655 ( `` the '655_patent `` ) ( collectively the `` Patents-in-Suit '' )
Appellees filed inter_alia a joint motion for summary_judgment arguing the various_claims were invalid based on a determination that D_Three could not claim priority from U.S. Patent Application No._61 /150,301 ( `` the 2009 Application '' ) and the District_Court granted Appellees ' Motion

BACKGROUND
The Patents-in-Suit are directed to roof mount_sealing_assemblies which allow users to mount objects on a roof and seal `` the mounting location.. against water ''
'517_patent Abstract ; '655_patent Abstract ; see '339_patent Abstract
For example the '517_patent claims inter_alia `` [ a ] roof standoff device for use in mounting an object to a roof '' comprising `` a base bracket '' `` a flashing '' 2 `` a core body '' and `` a second threaded attachment element ''
'517_patent col. 10_ll._27 -29 33 43 45 ( claim 1 )
It is undisputed that : SunModo 's allegedly infringing products were available to the public in 2010 ; EcoFasten 's allegedly infringing product was available to the public in June 2009,3 see D_Three 2017_WL_1023389 at *13 & n.16 ; and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued the Patents-in-Suit in 2014_and_2015
To successfully assert the Patents-in-Suit against the allegedly infringing products D_Three was required to claim priority from the 2009 Application 's effective filing date February 5 2009
See id.at *3 *13 ; J.A
2212

On summary_judgment the District_Court determined that the Asserted_Claims could not claim priority from the 2009 Application because they were broader than the invention disclosed in the 2009 Application such that they did not meet the written description requirement pursuant to 35 U.S.C.¡± 112 ( a ) ( 2012 )4 See D_Three 2017_WL_1023389 at *5 *9-10 *12
Specifically the District_Court divided the Asserted_Claims into two categories -- claims that recited a washer and claims that did not -- and asked whether `` the parent applications disclose roof mount assemblies that ( a ) do not have a soft_washer but also do not limit the type of attachment bracket and ( b ) have a soft_washer but do not limit its location ''
Id.at *7
The District_Court held that the 2009 Application 's only disclosure of a washerless_assembly `` requir [ ed a ] W [ - ] pronged attachment bracket 1700 '' but the Asserted_Claims disclosed broader configurations of washerless assemblies
Id.at *10 ; see J.A
*1046 2225 ( discussing the washerless_assembly in the 2009 Application ) 2246 ( Figure 41 )
The District_Court also held that the 2009 Application 's assemblies with washers only disclosed washers situated `` above the flashing '' but the Asserted_Claims covered assemblies with washers below the flashing
D_Three 2017_WL_1023389 at *11 *12
D_Three did `` not dispute that without the benefit of the 2009 [ A ] pplication 's filing date.. the [ P ] atents [ - ] in [ -S ] uit would be invalid due to intervening prior art '' i.e. SunModo 's allegedly infringing products and EcoFasten 's QuikFoot Roof Mount System
Id.at *13
Accordingly the District_Court invalidated all but one of the Asserted_Claims as anticipated based on D_Three 's stipulation and found the remaining claim ( claim 6 of the '655_patent ) asserted against the purportedly-withdrawn EcoFasten 's Tile Flashing System anticipated based on other prior art that post-dated the 2009 Application
