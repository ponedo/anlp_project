Opinion
PAULINE NEWMAN Circuit_Judge
ACCO Brands Inc. doing business as Kensington_Technology_Group sued Micro Security Devices Inc. doing business as PC_Guardian in the United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of California charging PC_Guardian with infringement of United States Patent No
B1 5,502,989 ( the ¡¬ 989 patent )
The court granted summary_judgment of noninfringement in favor of PC_Guardian.1 The judgment is affirmed

DISCUSSION
The ¡¬989_patent is directed to a locking mechanism for portable_electronic_devices such as computers
Claim 10 is the only claim in suit : 10
A locking system comprising : a portable_electronic_device including an exterior wall defining a security_slot ; cable means for attaching to a first object other than to the portable_electronic_device ; a housing proximate to said electronic device and including a slot_engagement_member having a slot engaging portion provided with a locking member having a peripheral profile complementary to preselected dimensions of said security_slot to thereby permit said locking member to extend into said slot said slot_engagement_member being rotatable between an unlocked_position wherein said locking member is removable from the slot and a locked_position wherein said *1077 locking member is retained within the slot ; a pin coupled through said housing for extending into said security_slot_proximate said slot engaging portion when said slot_engagement_member is in said locked_position to thereby inhibit rotation of said slot_engagement_member to said unlocked_position ; and
means coupled to said housing for attaching said cable to said housing
( Emphasis added )

The accused PC_Guardian_devices are the Notebook_Guardian 2000 and Notebook_Guardian 2001
The district court construed the `` pin '' clause to require that the pin actively extends into the security_slot when the slot_engagement_member is in the locked_position and that the pin thereby inhibits rotation to the unlocked_position : [ The pin is ] a post or peg coupled through said housing for extending into said security_slot_proximate said slot engaging portion at or during the time that said slot_engagement_member is in said locked_position to thereby inhibit rotation of said slot_engagement_member to said unlocked_position
( `` Extending '' being an active verb )

Kensington challenges this claim construction and its application to avoid infringement by the PC_Guardian_devices
