I
Since 1989 Durling has served as a freelance furniture designer in Tupelo Mississippi
In the spring of 1991 the president of Global Furniture Company ( Global ) requested that Durling prepare a design for a low-cost sectional sofa group with a corner table and integral end tables
Durling conceived of the design shown in the '243_patent ( reproduced below ) the embodiment of which Global sold until it went out of business in the spring of 1992
At that time one of Global 's customers had sufficient interest in the product that it asked Spectrum Furniture Co. Inc. ( Spectrum ) to make furniture embodying the design
Spectrum contacted the former president of Global and received his approval to supply the product to Global 's former customer

In August 1992 Durling submitted an application for a patent on the furniture design he had provided to Global
This application matured into the '243_patent which issued in September 1993
Shortly thereafter Durling sued Spectrum for infringement of his patent

At trial Spectrum argued that the sole_claim of the '243_patent was invalid as obvious in view of several prior art designs that were not considered by the examiner
Of these several references the district_court emphasized the design of a sectional group manufactured by Schweiger Furniture Industries Inc. ( the Schweiger_model ) reproduced below.1

Relying heavily on Durling 's concession that the Schweiger_model is the `` closest prior art to the design that 's involved in this case '' the district_court found that the differences between the prior art and the '243_patent are insignificant
Based on its further finding that Durling had not established commercial success related to the patented_design the district_court concluded that the sole_claim of the '243_patent is invalid as obvious under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103 ( 1994 )
Durling appeals from the district_court 's judgment which we review pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( 1994 )
