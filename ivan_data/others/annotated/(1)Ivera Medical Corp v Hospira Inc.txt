Before NEWMAN REYNA and TARANTO Circuit_Judges
Opinion
REYNA Circuit_Judge
Ivera Medical Corp. ( `` Ivera '' ) sued Hospira Inc. ( `` Hospira '' ) in the Southern_District of California alleging infringement of U.S. Patent Nos._7780,794 ( the ¡¬794_patent ) 7,985,302 ( the ¡¬302_patent ) and 8,206,514 ( the ¡¬514_patent )
The district court granted summary_judgment of invalidity finding the asserted patent claims obvious under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103
Ivera appeals
For the reasons that follow we reverse and remand

*1338 BACKGROUND
A
The Patents-in-Suit
The ¡¬514_patent is a continuation of ¡¬302_patent which is a continuation of the ¡¬794_patent
All three patents share the same written description.1 The patents explain that medical_implements such as catheters and luer ports are common sites for transmissions of pathogens into patients
¡¬794_patent_col. 1_ll._32 -35
To prevent these types of transmissions medical staff traditionally swabbed a site before making connections to medical_implements
Id
col. 1_ll._41 -45
The swabs came in a small pad of cotton gauze soaked in a cleaning_agent ( e.g. isopropyl alcohol ) and packed in a foil package to prevent evaporation
Id
col. 1_ll._45 -47
After swabbing the site is allowed to dry killing any pathogens
Id
col. 1_ll._48 -55

In practice these swabbing procedures were often `` overlooked '' or `` poorly executed ''
Id
col. 1_ll._56 -58
To overcome this problem the inventors provided a cleaning device that includes a cap that when used reliably disinfects a medical_implement
For example FIG._6 provided below shows a cross-sectional diagram of a cleaning device 100 that includes a cap 102
Id
col. 6_ll._19 -20
Cap 102 includes threads 105 adapted to receive a medical_implement and first and second cleaning_materials 107_and_108
Id
col. 6_ll._26 -BIG_TOKEN__30_and_49__BIG_TOKEN -52
When the medical_implement is twisted into cap 102 first cleaning_material 107 compresses radially cleansing the sides of the implement and second cleaning_material 108 compresses axially cleansing the foremost surface of the implement
See id
col. 7_ll._27 -33

?
Central to the parties ' arguments on summary_judgment are openings that permit venting of the interior of the cap
The patents describe two embodiments of these openings
First in FIG._6 threaded ring 106 can create `` a small vent aperture or opening '' relative to the inner wall of cap 102 to allow evaporation of the cleaning_agent in cap 102
Id
col. 6_ll._37 -43
Second in FIG._14 ( provided below ) holes 164 are formed in housing 162 of the cap
Holes 164 `` can promote evaporation of the cleaning_agent particularly when the housing covers a site of a medical_implement to be disinfected ''
Id
col. 8_ll._15 -17

?
*1339 The asserted claims of the patents-in-suit recite cleaning devices that include a `` second_opening '' `` aperture '' or `` means for venting '' that inhibit pressure buildup and allow for evaporation.2 For example claim 13 of the ¡¬794_patent recites :

13
A cleaning device for a medical_implement the cleaning device comprising : a cap having a first_opening to an inner_cavity an inner surface of the first_opening including one or more threads adapted to receive a site of the medical_implement ; a cleaning_material formed of a compressible material that is at least partially secured in the inner_cavity the cleaning_material containing a cleaning_agent ; a second_opening in the cap to allow evaporation of the cleaning_agent from the inner_cavity and to inhibit a buildup of pressure in the cap when the cleaning_material is compressed by the site of the medical_implement and a removable covering that covers the first_opening and the second_opening to the inner_cavity prior to coupling the threads of the cap with the site of the medical_implement via the first_opening

The parties focus their attention on FIG._10_b of Hoang which is provided below
FIG._10_b shows a cap_device 78 that has a lid 78a and a pad 80
Id
?
43
Cap device 78 can be twisted onto a patient 's valve using its threads ( not numerically referenced in FIG._10_b )
Id
?
44
Pad 80 can be used as a `` dry '' pad or a `` wet '' pad
Id
?
43
When used as a `` dry '' pad pad 80 is impregnated with an antimicrobial_agent that maintains antiseptic conditions on the *1340 access portion of a valve
Id
?
23
When used as a wet pad pad 80 is impregnated with a cleaning_agent and optionally an antimicrobial_agent
Id
?
27
In this latter example pad 80 can clean the valve as cap_device 78 is twisted on to the valve
Id
?

Chin-Loy
U.S._Patent_No._5954,957 ( `` Chin-Loy '' ) describes a cap adapted to cover blood_ports or other hydraulic connection ports for medical_devices such as hemodialysis machines
Chin-Loy col. 3_ll._19 -23
FIG._1 of Chin-Loy provided below shows a cap 10 with a first end 12 defining a female portion 16 which receives a male blood_port
Id
col. 3_ll._54 -57
Side wall 22 and end wall 24 together define a receptacle 34 that receives the male nipple
Id
col. 4_ll._5 -7
Cap 10 can be twisted onto a blood_port when the port is threaded or can `` snap on '' for unthreaded ports
Id
col. 4_ll._32 -35 col. 4_ll._46 -49
Cap 10 also includes a channel 66 defined by interior surface 28
Id
col. 5_ll._1 -2
When cap 10 is attached to a blood_port channel 66 permits `` venting of the medical_device through the male blood nipple while maintaining an internal condition of the medical_device until time of use ''
Id
col. 2_ll._41 -43 and col. 5_ll._1 2-15

Id
col. 7_ll._26 -27
Outer protective cap 78 contains a sponge 80 that is saturated with an antiseptic
Id
col. 7_ll._27 -29
When outer_protective_cap 78 is twisted onto externally threaded shoulder 74 the antiseptic from sponge 80 can `` bathe the exterior surfaces of distal_member 70 proximal_member 82 and self-sealing septum 84 ''
Id
col. 7_ll._29 -35

C. Prosecution History
In February 2007 Bobby Rogers and Paul DiPerna filed non-provisional application no._11 /705,805 ( the `` ¡¬805 application '' ) which led to the ¡¬794_patent
In response to a September 2009 Office Action which rejected all of the claims as either anticipated by Hoang or obvious over Hoang *1342 and various secondary references the applicant amended the claims to recite inter alia vents that allow for evaporation or drying of the cleaning_agent
J.A
5412-18
In response the examiner allowed the application
J.A
5029-33
In the Notice of Allowance the examiner stated that `` the reviewed prior_art does not disclose or render obvious a medical_implement cleaning device comprising a cap having holes or openings for venting the device while in use '' J.A
5033 and that Hoang does not disclose `` vent holes apertures or additional openings to inhibit vacuum [ sic ] in the cap cleaning device ''
J.A
5034
The ¡¬794_patent issued thereafter in August 2010

The ¡¬794 and ¡¬302_patent s were each subject to ex parte reexamination
In each of these proceedings the examiner initially rejected the claims over various references
In at least the reexamination of the ¡¬794_patent the examiner considered the Hoang_reference
J.A
5097-98
The examiner determined that the challenged claims of the ¡¬794 and ¡¬302_patent s were patentable over the cited prior_art based at least partially on the vent_limitations
J.A
38 ; J.A
54 ; J.A
5097-98 ; J.A
5161-62

Hospira later requested inter partes reexamination of the patents-in-suit which the United States Patent and Trademark Office granted
After the examiner rejected claims in an Action Closing Prosecution ( `` ACP '' ) Ivera attempted to enter seven declarations including one from an inventor of the Hoang_reference Minh Hoang and another from Dr. Alan Buchman the sole inventor of a prior_art reference relied on during the inter partes reexaminations but not at issue here
J.A
5473
In the Right of Appeal Notice ( `` RAN '' ) the examiner determined that these declarations would not be considered because Ivera had not explained why this evidence was not presented earlier in the proceedings
J.A
5473

Assessing the merits the examiner rejected all of the challenged claims as obvious over the combination of Hoang and Chin-Loy ( among other rejections )
J.A
5467-68 5513-14 5553-54
The examiner concluded that it would have been obvious to one of ordinary_skill to include `` the venting channel of Chin-Loy in the cap housing of Hoang because it would allow for venting from the cap interior while preventing the infiltration of microorganisms to maintain the sterile condition of the catheter access site ''
J.A
5468
The examiner also concluded that because threaded luer connections are not fluid-tight a threaded opening ( such as the ones disclosed in Hoang and White ) can meet the vent_limitations
See J.A
5521
Ivera informs us that it is appealing the rejections to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board
