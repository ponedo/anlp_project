Opinion
PAULINE NEWMAN Circuit_Judge
This case was remanded by the Supreme_Court for further consideration1 in light of the Court 's decision in Festo_Corp. v. Shoketsu_Kinzoku_Kogyo_Kabushiki_Co. 535_U.S._722 122_S.Ct._1831 152_L.Ed.2d_944 62_USPQ2d_1705_(2002)
The vacated decision Talbert_Fuel_Systems_Patents_Co. v. Unocal Corp. 275_F.3d_1371 1376-78 61_USPQ2d_1363 1366-68 ( Fed.Cir.2002 ) had affirmed the judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the Central_District of California,2 holding that ( 1 ) the claims of Talbert 's United States Patent No._5015,356 ( the ¡¬356_patent ) are limited to a hydrocarbon fuel with a high-end boiling point of 345¢XF ( 2 ) prosecution history estoppel precludes infringement under the doctrine of equivalents and ( 3 ) Talbert 's ¡¬356_patent and Unocal 's Patent No._5288,393 are not interfering patents
In Talbert this court had relied on the absolute bar established in Festo_Corp. v. Shoketsu_Kinzoku_Kogyo_Kabushiki_Co. 234_F.3d_558 56_USPQ2d_1865_(Fed.Cir.2000) ( en banc ) to deny Talbert access to the doctrine of equivalents
The Supreme_Court 's vacatur of that decision led to this GVR
*1357 We now return to this case in light of this court 's recent decision interpreting and applying the Court 's Festo decision
See Festo_Corp. v. Shoketsu_Kinzoku_Kogyo_Kabushiki_Co. 344_F.3d_1359_(Fed.Cir.2003) ( en banc )

I
The issue of infringement of Talbert 's ¡¬356_patent is focused on the limitation of all of the claims to a gasoline boiling_point_range of 121¢XF-345¢XF as in claim 1 : 1
A low Reid Vapor Pressure liquid gasoline for use in a standard carbureted internal combustion engine ; said gasoline comprising a priming agent and a hydrocarbon_mixture having an intermediate_carbon_range relative to C4-C12 fuel ; said intermediate_carbon_range consisting essentially of C6-C10 hydrocarbons with C9 and C10 paraffinic hydrocarbons being present in the mixture ; said gasoline having a boiling_point_range of 121¢XF-345¢XF at 1 atmosphere pressure.. ( Emphasis added )
The accused Unocal fuels were stated at trial to have boiling range endpoints of from 373.8¢XF to 472.9¢XF

Talbert again argues for literal infringement stating that the 345¢XF upper limit in the claims was included `` only to confirm the gasoline 's predominant C6-C10 composition and to establish cut ranges for the fuel 's gasifier form ''
Talbert states that `` [ t ] o interpret that temperature_range as a restriction or requirement regarding the presence of all the low- or high-end components contradicts the reality of accepted refinery practice and renders the claim meaningless ''
Talbert points out that the specification recognizes and teaches that small_amounts of hydrocarbons outside the claimed C6-C10 range may remain due to the imprecision of fractionation : [ The preferred intermediate range C6-C10 gasoline ].. can be made by removing the volatile and heavy components so that the remaining hydrocarbon_mixture will boil within a range of about 121¢XF-345¢XF at one atmosphere
Such a boiling_point_range encompasses the boiling point of the lowest boiling C6 component and the highest boiling C10 component
Of course it is possible that a small amount of C4 C5 C11 and C12 may remain after the separation process due to imperfections of gasoline fractionation procedures
'356_patent col. 7 lines 39-48
Thus Talbert argues that the 345¢XF limit is `` nothing more than a recognition that the highest boiling C10 hydrocarbon ( i.e. paraffinic decane ) must be present in the claimed composition '' and that the claims correctly construed do not exclude the presence of higher boilers in relatively small_amounts

In construing the claims even accepting Talbert 's view that gasoline fractionation does not readily achieve or require an exact endpoint the prosecution history does not permit a claim scope that departs significantly from the stated temperature_range
The temperature limit was placed in the claims at the examiner 's insistence to distinguish prior art that included a Hamilton reference that showed hydrocarbon fuels with an endpoint `` within the range of about 390¢XF and about 420¢XF ''
Talbert had argued to the examiner that `` the temperature_range of the boiling points of the hydrocarbons of the gasoline of the presently claimed invention is between 96.8¢XF and 345¢XF ''
To gain allowance Talbert was required to place the temperature restriction in the claims

Talbert presented no reasonable explanation of how his designated endpoint of 345¢XF is correctly construed to include fuels with endpoints of 373¢XF and higher
We therefore affirm the district court 's *1358 ruling that the claims are not literally infringed
