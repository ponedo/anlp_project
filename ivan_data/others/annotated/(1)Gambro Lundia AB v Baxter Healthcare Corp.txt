GAMBRO LUNDIA AB Plaintiff-Appellant v. BAXTER HEALTHCARE CORPORATION Defendant/Cross-Appellant
Nos._95-1530 96-1004
| April_8,_1997
Synopsis
Patentee brought action against competitor alleging infringement of its patent for recalibrating sensors during kidney dialysis to accurately measure impurities removed from patient 's blood
The United_States_District_Court for the District of Colorado Jim R. Carrigan J. ruled that patent was invalid and patentee appealed
The Court of Appeals Rader Circuit_Judge held that : ( 1 ) patent was not invalid on grounds of derivation ; ( 2 ) patent was not invalid as obvious ; and ( 3 ) patent was not invalid on grounds of inequitable_conduct

Reversed

Opinion
RADER Circuit_Judge
In this patent infringement case Gambro Lundia AB ( Gambro ) appeals and Baxter Healthcare Corporation ( Baxter ) cross-appeals a final judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the District of Colorado
The patent at issue U.S. Patent No._4585,552 ( '552_patent ) claims a `` system for the measurement of the difference between two fluid flows in separate ducts ''
This invention recalibrates sensors during hemodialysis to accurately measure the impurities removed from a patient 's blood
Due to error in the district_court 's analyses of invalidity unenforceability and infringement this court reverses

BACKGROUND
Hemodialysis commonly called dialysis removes contaminants and excess fluid from the patient 's blood when the kidneys do not function properly
Hemodialysis works by passing a dialysate solution through a machine called a dialyzer which functions as an *1575 artificial kidney
In the dialyzer the dialysate passes on one side of a porous diffusion membrane while the patient 's blood passes on the other side
Because of the pressure differential across the membrane blood contaminants and excess fluid diffuse through the membrane from the patient 's blood into the dialysate
These impurities diffused from the patient 's blood are known as ultrafiltrate

After hemodialysis the volume of the dialysate is greater
The difference between the initial and end volumes of dialysate can be used to calculate the amount of the ultrafiltrate removed from a patient 's blood
This calculation is critical to the success of hemodialysis
Removal of too much or too little ultrafiltrate may lead to severe medical problems or even death

Repgreen Limited ( Repgreen ) a British bioengineering company improved ultrafiltrate calculation
Keith Wittingham Repgreen 's chief designer introduced the Repgreen monitoring system the UFM 1000 in late 1977
Wittingham 's development relied on the research of Professor Michael Sanderson
The UFM 1000 used two electromagnetic flow sensors to measure the difference between the rate of dialysate flow into and out of the dialyzer
The difference in flow rates indicated the quantity of ultrafiltrate leaving the system
To calibrate the system for an accurate measurement of dialysate flow rates the operator would direct clean_dialysate through both sensors before dialysis
This calibration method however could not account for clogging in the outflow_sensor during dialysis
Over time the ultrafiltrate would build up behind the outflow_sensor and disrupt the accuracy of the measurements
Experts refer to this increasing inaccuracy as `` drift ''

In the late 1970s Gambro sought to improve ultrafiltrate monitoring
During 1979 Wittingham met with Gambro_engineers on two occasions to discuss Repgreen 's development of an ultrafiltrate monitor for Gambro
In July 1979 after Repgreen went bankrupt Gambro purchased Repgreen 's hemodialysis technology including the rights to the UFM 1000 monitor
After acquiring Repgreen 's technology Gambro 's research team worked for three years on improving ultrafiltration monitors
In June 1982 four Gambro_engineers including Bengt-Ake Gummesson refined the monitoring system
Their invention ultimately issued as the '552_patent

Gambro filed its initial patent application in Sweden on September 28 1982
Gambro followed up with a U.S._application in September 1983
Gunnar Boberg Repgreen 's in-house patent counsel and Arnold Krumholz Repgreen 's U.S. patent counsel prosecuted the U.S._application
The examiner rejected claim 1 as anticipated by a German patent application ( German '756 )
In response Gambro provided the examiner with a German-language copy of German '756 along with arguments prepared by Boberg ( who is fluent in German )
Based on this submission the examiner withdrew the rejection
The '552_patent issued on April_29,_1986

The Gambro invention uses valves to direct clean_dialysate around the dialyzer to recalibrate the sensors during dialysis
The invention 's valve system can direct clean_dialysate through the first flow sensor around the dialyzer and through the second flow sensor
To recalibrate the invention momentarily blocks passage of contaminated dialysate through the outflow_sensor
Instead clean_dialysate flows through the outflow_sensor and recalibrates the detectors with the same clean_dialysate flowing through both intake and outflow_sensors
After the brief recalibration the hemodialysis continues with contaminated dialysate flowing through the second sensor
Claim 1 of the '552_patent reads : [ 1 ] In dialysis equipment including a dialyser a system for measuring the difference in the rate of flow between first and second_fluid_streams said first_fluid_stream comprising clean dialysis solution flowing to the dialyser and said second_fluid_stream comprising spent dialysis solution flowing from the dialyser said system comprising
[ 2 ] a first duct for receiving said first_fluid_stream flowing therethrough [ 3 ] a second_duct for receiving said second_fluid_stream flowing therethrough [ 4 ] measuring means for measuring the difference in the rate of flow between said *1576 first and second_fluid_streams within said first and second_ducts [ 5 ] and transferring means for preventing the flow of said second_fluid_stream through said second_duct while flowing said first_fluid_stream through both said first and second_ducts without passing said first_fluid_stream through the dialyser and without altering said rate of flow of said first_fluid_stream between said first and second_ducts such that said rate of flow of said first_fluid_stream through said first and second_ducts is substantially equal [ 6 ] whereby the measured difference of the rate of flow of said first_fluid_stream flowing through said first and second_ducts is adaptable as a reference
( Paragraph enumeration added )

In 1984 Baxter acquired the dialysis equipment division of Extracorporeal Inc
Dissatisfied with the accuracy of the Extracorporeal technology Baxter developed the Baxter_SPS 550 and began marketing the device in December 1987
Gambro filed suit against Baxter in the District Court for the District of Colorado in March 1992 claiming the Baxter_SPS 550 infringed the '552_patent
In defense Baxter asserted the invalidity and unenforceability of the '552_patent

After a ten-day bench trial on the issues of infringement validity and unenforceability the district_court held claim 1 of the Gambro '552_patent invalid for obviousness and derivation and unenforceable for inequitable_conduct
The district_court also entered judgment in favor of Baxter on infringement contributory infringement inducing infringement and willful infringement due to the invalidity and unenforceability of the '552_patent
Further the district_court declined to award either party attorney fees or costs
