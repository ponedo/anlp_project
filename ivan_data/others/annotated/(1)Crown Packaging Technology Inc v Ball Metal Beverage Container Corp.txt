Crown Packaging Technology Inc. and Crown_Cork and Seal_USA Inc. ( collectively `` Crown '' ) appeal from the judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the Southern_District of Ohio following its granting of Ball Metal Beverage Container Corp. 's ( `` Ball 's '' ) motion for summary_judgment invalidating the asserted_claims of U.S. Patent Nos._6935,826 ( `` the ¡¬826_patent `` ) and 6,848,875 ( `` the ¡¬875_patent `` ) for violating the written description_requirement and because the asserted_claims were anticipated
Because the ¡¬826 and ¡¬875_patent s ' common_specification conveys to one of ordinary skill in the art that the patentee was in possession of the subject matter of the asserted_claims and because a material dispute remains as to what the prior_art inherently discloses we reverse and remand

I
BACKGROUND
A
The ¡¬826 and ¡¬875_Patent s. Crown and Ball are both in the business of selling can ends and can bodies to fillers associated with major beverage companies
`` Can ends '' are essentially the lids affixed to the top of beverage cans while `` can bodies '' are generally cylindrical hollow containers to which the can ends are attached for filling

The ¡¬826 and ¡¬875_patent s share a common_specification which identifies and discusses two ways to save metal when seaming can bodies and can ends
The specification teaches that `` improvements in metal_usage can be made by increasing the slope of the chuck_wall and limiting the width of the anti_peaking_bead ''
*1376 ¡¬826_patent col.1 ll.33-35.1 Both improvements result in significant metal savings without reducing the overall can diameter meaning that the improvements could be run on existing machinery

The specification first describes the invention of increasing the slope of the can end 's chuck_wall ( also referred to as the `` can end wall '' )
This new_geometry is different from prior_art_Figure 2 which shows a steep can end wall that has a relatively small angle_C relative to the vertical_axis :

?
The specification teaches that angle_C in prior_art can end walls is `` between 12¢X and 20¢X to the vertical ''
Id
col.1 ll.21-55

In contrast to the prior_art the specification describes a can end where the `` chuck_wall is inclined to axis_perpendicular to the exterior of the central_panel at an angle between 30¢X and 60¢X '' and preferably `` between 40¢X and 45¢X ''
Id
col.2 ll.9-12
The new_geometry is illustrated in Figure 5 below :

?
This change in geometry-increasing the size of angle_C relative to the vertical_axis to make the chuck_wall less steep-reduces the use of metal in the manufacturing of the can end
Id
col.2 ll.1-12

*1377 The specification also teaches that metal can be saved by `` limiting the width of the anti_peaking_bead '' preferably to a `` bead narrower than 1.5mm '' in radius
Id
col.1 ll.33-35 col.2 ll.10-11 col.4 l.19
This anti_peaking_bead-also known as the reinforcing bead-is the U-shaped structure shown in prior_art_Figure 2 around the location labeled `` D. '' In connection therewith the specification discusses a new seaming method employing a modified seaming_chuck to avoid causing damage to the chuck or the reinforcing bead damage which otherwise might result from the narrowing of the bead
An embodiment of the modified seaming_chuck ( 30 ) is shown below in Figures 6_and_7 :

?
In this embodiment the can end is placed over a can body ( 12 )
Seaming rollers ( 34 38 ) and modified chuck ( 30 ) are then applied
The modified chuck ( 30 ) has a frustoconical drive surface ( 32 ) which engages with the chuck_wall ( 24 ) of the can end ( 22 )
Id
col.4 ll.43-46
During this seaming_process the `` upper_portion '' of the chuck_wall ( 24 ) is deformed so as to be bent upwardly around the chuck
Id
col.5 ll.7-12
The left-hand_side of Figure 6 shows the beginning of this deformation and the right-hand_side of Figure 7 shows the final deformation after seaming is complete
The upper_portion of the chuck_wall is bent upwardly so as to be substantially vertical after seaming

As the specification explains this modified chuck ( 30 ) does not drive deeply into the anti_peaking_bead ( 25 )
Id
col.4 ll.59-62 col.4 l.65-col.5 l.3
The specification teaches that a chuck with `` a narrow annular flange '' is `` more likely to fracture ''
Id
col.1_ll.65-67 col.3 ll.46-47
Moreover *1378 there `` is a risk of scuffing if this annulus slips '' which may leave `` unsightly black marks after pasteurization ''
Id
col.1_ll.65-66 col.3 ll.49-50
To avoid these problems the modified chuck does not drive deeply into the reinforcing bead

The parties agree that the specification teaches that `` improvements in metal_usage can be made by increasing the slope of the chuck_wall and limiting the width of the anti_peaking_bead ''
Id
col.1 ll.33-35
However the parties disagree as to whether the written description supports an invention that improves metal_usage by increasing the slope of the chuck_wall without a modified chuck that does not drive deeply into the reinforcing bead

Claim 14 is the one asserted claim of the ¡¬826_patent
All of the ¡¬826 product claims are directed to a can end before it is seamed to a can body
Claim 14 depends from claim 13 and recites a series of structural features
Both claims are set out below : 13
A metal can end for use in packaging beverages under pressure and adapted to be joined to a can body by a seaming_process so as to form a double_seam therewith using a rotatable_chuck comprising first and second circumferentially extending walls said first and second chuck_walls forming a juncture_therebetween said can end comprising ; a peripheral_cover_hook said peripheral_cover_hook comprising a seaming_panel adapted to be formed into a portion of said double_seam during said seaming_operation ; a central_panel ; a wall extending inwardly and downwardly from said cover_hook a first portion of said wall extending from said cover_hook to a first_point on said wall said first wall portion adapted to be deformed during said seaming_operation so as to be bent upwardly around said juncture of said chuck_walls at said first_point on said wall a second portion of said wall extending from said first_point to a second_point forming a lowermost end of said wall a line extending between said first and second_points being inclined to an axis_perpendicular to said central_panel at an angle of between 30¢X and 60¢X
14
The end according to claim 13 further comprising an annular reinforcing bead connected to said wall at said second_point said annular reinforcing bead connecting said wall to said central_panel
Id
col.10 ll.37-65

Claims 50_and_52 are the two asserted_claims of the ¡¬875_patent
All of the ¡¬875 claims are directed to methods of seaming a can end
Claim 52 depends from claim 50 and both are reproduced below : 50
A method of forming a double_seam between a can body and a can end intended for use in packaging a carbonated beverage said method comprising the steps of : a ) providing a can end having a circumferentially extending peripheral_cover_hook said peripheral_cover_hook comprising a seaming_panel to be formed into a portion of said double_seam during a seaming_operation an annular reinforcing bead and a circumferentially extending wall extending from said seaming_panel to said reinforcing bead said wall and said reinforcing bead forming a transition therebetween ; b ) placing said cover_hook of said can end into contact with a circumferentially extending flange of a can body ; c ) providing a rotatable_chuck comprising first and second circumferentially extending walls said second chuck_wall depending from said first *1379 chuck_wall so as to form a juncture_therebetween ; d ) bringing said chuck into engagement with said can end ; and
e ) performing said seaming_operation by placing one or more seaming rolls into contact with said peripheral_cover_hook of said can end while said can end rotates so as to deform said seaming_panel of said cover_hook and to bend a portion of said can end wall upwardly around said juncture of said chuck_walls at a first_location on said can end wall a straight line extending from said first_location on said can end wall to said transition between said can end wall and said reinforcing bead inclined between about 20¢X and about 60¢X with respect to said axial_centerline both before and after said seaming_operation
52
The method according to claim 50 wherein said line extending from said first_location to said transition is inclined between about 30¢X and about 50¢X with respect to said axial_centerline of said can end both before and after performing said seaming_operation
