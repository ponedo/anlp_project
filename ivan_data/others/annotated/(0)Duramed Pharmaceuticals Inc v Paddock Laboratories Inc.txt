No._2010-1419
| July_21,_2011
Synopsis
Background : Patentee filed action against competitor alleging that manufacture and marketing of generic_version of conjugated estrogen_tablets infringed patent
The United_States_District_Court for the Southern_District of New_York Leonard B
Sand Senior District Judge 715_F.Supp.2d_552 granted summary_judgment of noninfringement
Patentee appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Lourie Circuit_Judge held that :

presumption of prosecution_history estoppel applied ;

polyvinyl_alcohol ( PVA ) moisture_barrier_coating ( MBC ) to inhibit absorption of moisture and reduce storage-related degradation of conjugated estrogen_tablets need only have been known in field of pharmaceutical_compositions as of time of patentee 's narrowing amendment for prosecution_history estoppel to apply ; and

international_patent_application rendered use of PVA as MBC foreseeable

Affirmed

Opinion
LOURIE Circuit_Judge
Duramed Pharmaceuticals Inc. ( `` Duramed '' ) appeals from the decision of the United_States_District_Court for the Southern_District of New_York granting summary_judgment of noninfringement to Paddock Laboratories Inc. ( `` Paddock '' )
Duramed Pharms. Inc. v. Paddock Labs. Inc. 715_F.Supp.2d_552 ( S.D.N.Y.2010 )
Because the district_court did not err in holding that prosecution_history estoppel bars Duramed 's allegations of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents we affirm

BACKGROUND
Duramed owns U.S._Patent 5,908,638 ( `` ¡¬638_patent `` ) which claims conjugated estrogen pharmaceutical_compositions for use in hormone replacement therapies
The claimed conjugated estrogens are extremely water sensitive and thus highly susceptible to moisture degradation during storage
See ¡¬638_patent col.6 ll.46-56
Accordingly Duramed developed a formulation for conjugated estrogens that includes a moisture_barrier_coating ( `` MBC '' ) to inhibit the absorption of moisture and reduce storage-related degradation
See id
col.6 ll.36-45

Duramed filed a patent application on its formulation on July_26,_1995
Original independent claim 1 recited a conjugated estrogen pharmaceutical composition `` coated with a moisture_barrier_coating ''
J.A
254
Original dependent claim 7 limited `` said moisture_barrier_coating '' to one that `` comprises ethylcellulose ''
J.A
255
The examiner rejected both claims as obvious but during an interview advised that he would allow the application if Duramed amended claim 1 to include inter_alia the limitations of claim 7
In a response received December 3 1998 Duramed amended claim 1 to recite pharmaceutical_compositions with `` a moisture_barrier_coating_comprising_ethylcellulose ''
J.A
304
Claim 1 of the issued ¡¬638_patent the patent 's only independent claim accordingly reads as follows : 1
A pharmaceutical composition in a solid unit dosage form capable of oral administration for the hormonal treatment of peri-menopausal menopausal and post-menopausal disorders in a woman comprising : conjugated estrogens coated onto one or more organic_excipients forming a powdered conjugated estrogen composition where said composition is substantially free of inorganic_excipients and further comprises about 30-70 % gel-forming organic_excipient and about 30-70 % non-gel forming organic_excipient by weight and having less than about 2.5 % free water by weight and greater than 2.5 % total water wherein said solid unit dosage form is coated with a moisture_barrier_coating_comprising_ethylcellulose
¡¬638_patent claim 1 ( emphasis added )

In March 2009 Duramed filed suit against Paddock under 35 U.S.C.¡± 271 ( e ) ( 2 ) alleging infringement of the ¡¬638_patent based on Paddock 's Abbreviated New Drug Application ( `` ANDA '' ) for a generic_version of Duramed 's hormone replacement therapy product CenestinTHE_R
Duramed alleged infringement of claims 1 4 and 6-8 under the doctrine of equivalents because Paddock 's proposed generic_product uses a polyvinyl_alcohol ( `` PVA '' ) MBC marketed as Opadry_AMB
Paddock moved for summary_judgment of noninfringement arguing that Duramed was barred by amendment-based prosecution_history estoppel from alleging that PVA *1379 met the `` moisture_barrier_coating_comprising_ethylcellulose '' limitation of the asserted claims

In its motion for summary_judgment Paddock relied on several pre-amendment references including an international_patent_application filed by Colorcon pursuant to the Patent Cooperation Treaty ( `` the Colorcon_PCT '' )
The Colorcon_PCT published on January 25 1996 discloses formulations of PVA-based MBCs including Opadry_AMB but also in a section entitled `` Description of the Prior Art '' notes several technical drawbacks of using PVA as an MBC
Paddock also relied on ( 1 ) U.S._Patent 3,935,326 ( `` the Groppenbacher_patent '' ) which issued in 1976 and discloses the use of PVA in moisture-tight tablets ; ( 2 ) an article in the December 1995 issue of `` Manufacturing Chemist '' that tests PVA_MBCs and concludes that Opadry_AMB is a highly effective moisture barrier formulation ; ( 3 ) three scientific articles on PVA_MBCs authored for distribution at scientific conferences in May 1995 May 1998 and November 1998 ; and ( 4 ) invoices indicating sales of Opadry_AMB by Colorcon before September 1996

The district_court granted Paddock 's motion for summary_judgment of noninfringement holding that prosecution_history estoppel barred Duramed 's infringement allegations
Duramed 715 F.Supp.2d at 555-56
The district_court first held that Duramed 's amendment adding the ethylcellulose limitation was substantially related to patentability and narrowed the scope of the asserted claims thus triggering the presumption under Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co. 344_F.3d_1359 1366-67 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) ( en banc ) ( `` Festo IX `` ) that Duramed had surrendered all territory between the original and amended claim scope
Duramed 715 F.Supp.2d at 559-60

The district_court then held that Duramed had failed to rebut the Festo presumption based on an argument of inter_alia the unforeseeability of the use of PVA as an MBC in a pharmaceutical formulation
Id.at 560
Rather the court held that PVA_MBCs were foreseeable at the time of Duramed 's narrowing amendment based on the Colorcon_PCT 's description of PVA as `` a moisture_barrier_coating for pharmaceutical tablets and the like '' and its disclosure of the Opadry_AMB formulation used in Paddock 's proposed generic_product
Id.at 560-61
The court noted that several other facts reinforced this decision : ( 1 ) the pre-September 1996 invoices for the sale of Opadry_AMB ; and ( 2 ) the Groppenbacher_patent which teaches coating tablets with PVA to ensure `` 'moisture tight [ ness ] ' and 'insolub [ ility ] in the gastrointestinal tract '
`` 1 Id.at 561-62
Finally the court rejected Duramed 's argument that the Colorcon_PCT 's disclosure of PVA_MBCs ' technical drawbacks raised serious questions about PVA 's effectiveness as an MBC concluding that `` even if the effectiveness of PVA was unknown in 1998 that would not mean that PVA_MBCs were unforeseeable ''
Id.at 563

Duramed timely appealed to this court
We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
