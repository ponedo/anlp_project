United States Court of Appeals Federal Circuit
LAITRAM CORPORATION and Intralox Inc. Plaintiffs-Appellants v. MOREHOUSE INDUSTRIES INC. ( now Summa_Corporation ) KVP Acquisition Corp. and KVP_Systems Inc. Defendants Cross-Appellants
Nos._97-1422 97-1582
| May_5,_1998
Synopsis
Patentee brought action alleging infringement of patents for plastic modules used to form conveyor_belts
The United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of California William B. Shubb Chief Judge granted summary_judgment for alleged infringer on grounds of noninfringement but granted summary_judgment for patentee on issue of validity
Patentee appealed and alleged infringer cross-appealed
The Court of Appeals Lourie Circuit_Judge held that : ( 1 ) claims at issue required claimed modules to have flat driving_surfaces so claims were not literally infringed by accused devices which had curved driving_surfaces ; ( 2 ) `` sprocket_recess '' limitation in patent required two opposing transverse_elements and patent was thus not literally infringed by accused device which contained single_transverse_section ; and ( 3 ) patents were not infringed under doctrine of equivalents

Opinion
LOURIE Circuit_Judge
The Laitram Corporation and Intralox Inc. ( collectively `` Laitram '' ) appeal from the decision of the United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of California granting summary_judgment of noninfringement of certain claims of two of Laitram 's patents
Laitram Corp. v. Morehouse Indus. Inc. No
S-94-0452 WBS/GGH ( E.D.Cal
Apr._23,_1997 )
The Summa_Corporation the KVP Acquisition Corporation and KVP_Systems Inc. ( collectively `` KVP '' ) cross-appeal from the court 's grant of summary_judgment that those claims were not invalid
See id
Because neither the court 's claim_construction nor its noninfringement determination was in error and because the court did not err in concluding that KVP could not meet its burden of proving invalidity by clear and convincing_evidence we affirm

BACKGROUND
U.S
Patents B1 4,934,518 and B1 4,886,158 issued from continuations of the same parent application and pertain generally to a plastic `` module '' ( 10 ) connectable to other like modules to form a conveyor_belt
As described in the specifications of the two patents which share a common written description the center of each module contains several `` sprocket_recesses '' ( 50 ) which mate with `` sprockets '' ( i.e. teeth ) ( 52 ) of a `` sprocket_wheel '' ( 54 ) during operation of the conveyor_belt
The disclosed sprocket_recesses are trapezoidally-shaped and are designed to mate with trapezoidally-shaped sprockets
The angled edges of the sprocket_recesses are referred to in the written description as `` transverse_sections '' ( 32_and_34 ) and the areas of engagement between the sprockets and the transverse_sections are referred to as the `` driving_surfaces ''
These various elements are shown in Figures 1 3 and 7 which respectively show a single module a cross-section of a single sprocket_recess and a conveyor_belt comprising several interconnected modules :

FIG._7
-- -- -

Laitram sued KVP alleging that two of its products the `` All-In-One '' module and the `` Fluid_Flo '' module infringe claims 1 5 7 49 and 100 of its '518_patent and claim 10 of its '158_patent1 Pictures of the accused modules are shown below :

?
-- -- - The parties do not dispute that the driving_surfaces of the accused modules are curved and that the `` All-In-One '' module contains a single_transverse_section forming a single driving surface

All of the disputed limitations of the asserted claims are similar to each other differing in ways immaterial to this appeal
The limitations of claim 1 of the '518_patent are representative ; that claim reads as follows : '' at least two transverse_elements.. defining at least two sprocket_recesses.. capable of receiving cooperative sprocket_teeth '' [ the `` sprocket_recess '' limitation ]
each transverse_element having a `` driving surface within said sprocket_recesses and at least a portion of each of said driving_surfaces extending downwardly.. and in the direction of intended travel '' [ the `` driving surface '' limitation ]

KVP moved for summary_judgment of noninfringement and invalidity in the district_court
The district_court examined the claim language the written description and the *1460 prosecution_history2 in arriving at an interpretation of these limitations ; the most pertinent aspects of the court 's analysis are summarized here
In order to determine if the `` driving surface '' limitation reads on the curved driving_surfaces of the accused devices the court noted that the written description disclosed only flat ( i.e. planar ) surfaces
Moreover the court observed that during prosecution the applicant attempted to distinguish his invention over the prior art by arguing that the combination of the Kewley '763 and Palmaer '831_patent s did not render his invention obvious because :

the cylindrically shaped wall of the drive link of the chain of Palmaer.. does not and could not provide the module of the instant invention having an intermediate section composed of at least one transverse_member and longitudinal members intersecting the transverse_member that define at least one sprocket_recess where the [ sic ] at least one transverse_element has a driving surface within the sprocket_recess that extends downwardly toward the bottom_surface and in the direction of travel
( emphasis added )3 Accordingly the court concluded that the applicant `` distinguished a cylindrically shaped driving surface from one that 'extends downwardly toward the bottom_surface in the direction of travel ' `` slip op.at A19 and that the `` driving surface '' limitation was accordingly limited to `` angled planar '' driving_surfaces id.at A21
The district_court construed the `` sprocket_recess '' limitation as requiring `` opposing transverse_elements each of which contains a driving surface capable of mating with the corresponding side of a single sprocket_tooth ''
Id.at A26 ( emphasis added )
The court again turned to the written description and noted that the only disclosed embodiment showed sprocket_recesses bound by two opposing transverse_elements
See e.g. Figure 3 supra
The court also observed that the benefits of having opposing transverse_elements were noted in the written description as allowing bi-directional movement : `` [ t ] he sprocket_recesses 50 are in line and can be driven in either direction
The associated sprocket_teeth are also symmetrical and in line such that the sprocket_wheel can be driven in either direction and installed either way on a driving shaft. ``
'158_patent col._4,_ll._38-42

The court also found support for its interpretation of the `` sprocket_recess '' limitation in the prosecution_history
First the court observed that the applicant had described the `` essence '' of his invention as `` the provision of sprocket_recesses.. having angularly disposed sides adapted to mate with corresponding sprocket_teeth without scrubbing
`` 4 ( emphasis added )
Second the court noted that the applicant had distinguished his invention over Lapeyre '527 which disclosed only a single_transverse_element by noting that `` the Lapeyre '527_patent.. does not disclose or suggest the presently claimed invention and does not even teach the use of sprocket_recesses in conveyor modules ''
Third the court noted that the applicant represented that his invention required that a given sprocket_tooth during operation of the belt contacted both the front and back of the recess and therefore by necessary implication that the recess necessarily included *1461 opposing transverse_elements
Specifically when arguing that his claims were not anticipated by Kewley '763 the applicant noted that `` [ a ] ny attempt to drive a conveyor_belt built according to the Kewley [ p ] atent by a sprocket_tooth simultaneously contacting both interior parallel surfaces would clearly be technically unfeasible and would render the belt substantially inoperative ''
( emphasis added )

Finally the court considered Laitram 's argument that the doctrine of claim_differentiation warranted an interpretation of the `` sprocket_recess '' limitation that encompassed a single_transverse_element because claim 2 of the '518_patent explicitly required opposing transverse_elements
The court disagreed noting that `` claim_differentiation is a guide not a rigid rule '' and that because the `` sprocket_recess '' limitation bore `` only one interpretation similarity [ between the claims ] will have to be tolerated ''
Slip op.at A22 ( citations and internal quotations omitted )

Working from this claim_construction the court concluded that neither of the accused devices literally infringed the asserted claims and granted KVP 's motion for summary_judgment of noninfringement
Specifically the court determined that neither the `` All-In-One '' module nor the `` Fluid_Flo '' module infringed the claims because each had curved driving_surfaces and accordingly did not meet the `` driving surface '' limitation
Additionally the court determined that the `` All-In-One '' module had only a single_transverse_element and accordingly did not meet the `` sprocket_recess '' limitation
The court further concluded that prosecution_history estoppel precluded infringement under the doctrine of equivalents

The court granted Laitram 's motion for summary_judgment that the claims of its patents were not invalid,5 concluding that even if the evidence were construed `` in the light most favorable to KVP [ KVP ] can not show by clear and convincing_evidence that the '' asserted claims were invalid
Slip op.at A33

Laitram appeals the district_court 's grant of KVP 's summary_judgment_motion for noninfringement arguing that the court 's claim_construction was erroneous and that the existence of genuinely disputed fact issues precluded summary_judgment of noninfringement under the doctrine of equivalents
KVP cross-appeals the district_court 's grant of Laitram 's summary_judgment_motion that the asserted claims are not invalid
