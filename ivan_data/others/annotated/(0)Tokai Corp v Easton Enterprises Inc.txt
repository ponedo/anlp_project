Synopsis
Background : Patentees holding three patents related to extended-rod safety_utility_lighters with automatic locking features brought infringement action against competitors
Competitors counterclaimed for invalidity
The United_States_District_Court for the Central_District of California Virginia A. Phillips J. 2009_WL_1582924 construed patent claims and thereafter 2009_WL_2047845 granted motion to strike supplemental_invalidity_contentions and granted summary_judgment of invalidity for obviousness
Parties cross-appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Lourie Circuit_Judge held that :

district_court did not abuse its discretion by declining to exempt patentees ' expert from discovery_rule 's written report_requirement ;

patentees ' failure to adhere to discovery_rule 's written report_requirement for experts was not harmless or substantially justified warranting exclusion of experts ' declarations ;

competitors did not have enhanced burden of overcoming statutory presumption that patents were valid in seeking summary_judgment of invalidity ; and

asserted patent claims were obvious rendering them invalid

Affirmed

Newman Circuit_Judge filed a dissenting opinion

Tokai_Corp. Scripto-Tokai Inc. and Calico_Brands Inc. ( collectively `` Tokai '' ) appeal from the decision of the United_States_District_Court for the Central_District of California granting a motion for summary_judgment of invalidity for obviousness of U.S
Patents 5,697,775 ( the `` ¡¬775_patent `` ) ; 5,897,308 ( the `` ¡¬308_patent `` ) ; and 6,093,017 ( the `` ¡¬017_patent `` )

June 2 2009 ) and the court 's order granting Tokai 's motion to strike Easton 's supplemental_invalidity_contentions Tokai_Corp. v. Easton_Enters Inc. EDCV 07-00883-VAP 2009_WL_2047845 ( C.D.Cal
July 8 2009 )
Because the district_court correctly granted summary_judgment of invalidity we affirm
As a result we need not decide Easton 's cross-appeal

BACKGROUND
Tokai owns the asserted_patents which relate to safety_utility_lighters having extended lighting_rods ( useful for lighting barbecue grills for example )
The asserted_patents share a priority_date of August 15 1995.1 The claims of the asserted_patents are directed to utility_lighters with automatic child-safety mechanisms for preventing accidental ignition
Tokai competes with Easton in the market for safety_utility_lighters
Tokai asserts that it has sold more than 100 million safety_utility_lighters in the United States under one or more of its asserted_patents
SJ_Order slip op.at 37
Tokai also contends that Easton has sold more than nine million such lighters

In July 2007 Tokai sued Easton in the District Court for the Central_District of California for infringing the asserted_patents
Easton counterclaimed for invalidity
At issue are claim 1 of the ¡¬775_patent ; claims 1 10 and 13 of the ¡¬308_patent ; and claims 1 3 and 4 of the ¡¬017_patent

The parties agree that the asserted claims substantially overlap
Each of the asserted independent claims describes a `` lighting_rod '' ( i.e. a utility lighter ) having a particular `` safety_device ''
The differences among the asserted claims arise primarily in the safety-device portion of the claim
Claim 1 of the ¡¬775_patent exemplifies the asserted claims : *1362 1
A safety_device in a lighting_rod which lighting_rod is provided with a rod-like_top_end_portion and a main_body the rod-like_top_end_portion being provided with a jetting nozzle for jetting out a gas the main_body being provided with : i ) a gas_tank ii ) a valve_mechanism for opening and closing a path through which the gas is supplied from the gas_tank to the jetting nozzle iii ) a piezoelectric_unit for generating a discharge voltage for lighting the gas and
iv ) an operation_member which is capable of sliding which has an operating_section and which drives the valve_mechanism and the piezoelectric_unit in order to carry out a lighting_operation the operating_section of the operating member being exposed to the exterior of the main_body the safety_device comprising : a ) a locking member having an engagement section which interferes with a portion of the operation_member and thereby locks the lighting_operation of the operation_member said locking member being capable of moving in a direction that intersects with the direction along which the operation_member moves and
b ) an urging member which urges said locking member to a locking direction said locking member being movable to a lock_releasing_position against the urging force of said urging member wherein with the locking member in the lock_releasing_position the lighting_operation is carried out by operating the operating_section of the operation_member and said locking member automatically returns to the state of the locking as the operation_member returns to its original position
¡¬775_patent col.24 l.59-col.25 l.28 ( emphases added )
As illustrated by the relevant portions of figures 8A and 8B of the ¡¬775_patent the claimed utility lighter has a trigger ( `` operation_member '' 120 ) and a safety_device which comprises a `` locking member '' ( 125 ) and a spring ( `` urging member '' 26 )
To operate the lighter the user depresses the locking member against the force of the spring and pulls the trigger
When the user releases the locking member the spring automatically returns the locking member to its initial position where the trigger is blocked from inadvertent actuation

*1363. ?
In June 2009 the district_court issued a claim_construction_order after which Easton stipulated that its accused utility_lighters infringe all but one of the asserted claims as construed by the court.2 SJ_Order slip op.at 3

In September 2009 Tokai moved for summary_judgment on Easton 's counterclaim of invalidity for obviousness and Easton filed a cross-motion for summary_judgment for obviousness of the asserted_patents over four prior_art_references
In opposition to Easton 's motion Tokai submitted expert_declarations from Dr. Jones ( the `` Jones declaration '' ) and Mr
Sung ( the `` Sung declaration '' )
Easton objected to the declarations and the district_court sustained Easton 's objection
SJ_Order slip op.at 6-7
The district_court noted that Tokai failed to submit written reports from Jones and Sung during expert discovery and that as a result Easton was denied an opportunity to depose these witnesses on the subject matter of their expert_declarations
The court thus declined to consider either declaration in resolving the parties ' summary_judgment motions

On the issue of invalidity the district_court determined that there existed no genuine_issue of material_fact as to the obviousness of the asserted claims over the four prior_art_references asserted by Easton : U.S
Patents 5,326,256 ( `` Shike '' ) ; 5,199,865 ( `` Liang '' ) ; 5,090,893 ( `` Floriot '' ) ; and 4,832,596 ( `` Morris '' )
In doing so the court applied the four-factor analysis for obviousness under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103 as set forth in Graham v. John Deere Co. 383_U.S._1 17-18 86_S.Ct._684 15_L.Ed.2d_545_(1966)
First the court found no genuine_issue of material_fact regarding the scope and content of the asserted prior_art_references
SJ_Order slip op.at 18-22
Secondly the court found no material dispute *1364 regarding the differences between the prior_art and the claimed invention
Id.at 23-33
The court found that with the exception of a single aspect of claims 10_and_13 of the ¡¬308_patent ( discussed further infra ) each element of the asserted claims was disclosed in the asserted prior_art
Id.at 23
Third with regard to the level of skill in the art the district_court noted that the parties disagreed sharply
The court determined however that the dispute was immaterial as the court 's conclusion on obviousness was the same under either party 's asserted level of skill
Id.at 36
Finally the court evaluated Tokai 's alleged objective indicia of nonobviousness
Tokai asserted that its commercial success supported patentability but the court found no nexus between the sales data and the merits of the invention beyond what was available in the prior_art
Id.at 38-39
The court also found unpersuasive Tokai 's asserted evidence that Easton copied the claimed inventions
Id.at 40
Based on its analysis of the Graham factors the district_court concluded that the asserted claims would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art as of the priority_date of the asserted_patents and entered final judgment on October 23 2009

Tokai timely appealed from the district_court 's exclusion of its expert_declarations and from the district_court 's grant of summary_judgment of invalidity of the asserted claims
We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
