by the United_States_District_Court for the Central_District of California ( Pfaelzer J )

We affirm

BACKGROUND
In January 1980 Korody sued GM seeking a judgment declaring GM 's U.S. Patent No._3555,972 invalid
GM counterclaimed for infringement of that patent
In January 1982 Korody answered the counterclaim alleging inter alia that GM 's charge of infringement was made in bad faith to hamper competition that the patent was obtained by fraud that GM knew there was no basis for a valid patent when it filed its application and that GM knowingly failed to disclose extensive pertinent prior art to the PTO
At the same time Korody added an antitrust_claim alleging an illegal tie-in and demanding a jury trial on that claim
In July 1982 the district court entered a stipulated order staying proceedings on the antitrust_claim pending completion of a bench_trial of the patent_validity_issue
Proceedings on GM 's infringement counterclaim were also stayed

On August 10 1984 Judge_Pfaelzer held GM 's patent invalid as fraudulently obtained and for obviousness under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103
Korody-Colyer Corp. v. General_Motors_Corp. 224_USPQ_368_(C.D.Cal.1984)
On May_2,_1985 this court affirmed
760_F.2d_1293 225_USPQ_1099_(Fed.Cir.1985)

In June 1986 Korody filed the Second_Supplemental and Amended_Complaint at issue here
That complaint contained an added claim that GM had violated the antitrust laws by enforcing a knowingly invalid patent fraudulently obtained a claim designated by all concerned as a `` Walker_Process '' claim.1

On December 3 1986 after a hearing Judge_Pfaelzer filed clear succinct and complete findings and conclusions and entered her summary judgment of the same date holding that Korody 's `` Walker_Process '' claim was barred by the four-year *1574 statute of limitations 15 U.S.C.¡± 15 ( b )
The court rejected each of the arguments for tolling presented by Korody
