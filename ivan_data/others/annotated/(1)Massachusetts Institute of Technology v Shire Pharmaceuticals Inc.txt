United States Court of Appeals Federal Circuit
MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY Children 's Medical_Center_Corporation Plaintiffs-Appellees
v. SHIRE PHARMACEUTICALS INC. NKA Shire Pharmaceuticals LLC Shire_Regenerative_Medicine Inc. Defendants-Appellants
2015-1881
| Decided : October 13 2016
Synopsis
Background : Patent assignees brought action alleging infringement of two patents directed to three-dimensional_scaffolding for growing cells in vitro to produce organ_tissue in vivo
The United_States_District_Court for the District of Massachusetts Mark L. Wolf Chief Judge construed specific terms and entered final_judgment of validity and infringement
Defendants appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Stoll Circuit_Judge held that :

during prosecution of patents there was no clear and unmistakable_disclaimer of including skin in construction of term `` vascularized_organ_tissue '' ;

during prosecution of patents there was no clear and unmistakable_disclaimer to preclude construction of term `` cells derived from a vascularized_tissue '' to include both parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells ; and

term `` three-dimensional_scaffold '' was not invalid as indefinite and thus according to its ordinary meaning meant `` a supporting structure that allows cells to attach along its width length and height ''

Opinion
Concurring opinion filed by Circuit_Judge O'Malley
Stoll Circuit_Judge
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Children 's Medical_Center_Corporation ( collectively `` MIT '' ) brought suit against Shire Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Shire_Regenerative_Medicine Inc. ( collectively `` Shire '' ) for infringement of U.S. Patent Nos._5770 193_and_5759,830
The ¡¬ 193 and ¡¬830_patent s are directed to three-dimensional_scaffolding for growing cells in vitro to produce organ_tissue in vivo
Following the district court 's construction of the terms `` vascularized_organ_tissue '' and `` cells derived from a vascularized_tissue '' and its determination that the term `` three-dimensional_scaffold '' was not indefinite the parties stipulated to a final_judgment of validity and infringement
For the reasons below we affirm

BACKGROUND
I
In the field of organ transplantation surgeons face the challenge of donor scarcity in addition to the technical complexity of transplanting whole or segmented organs into organ recipients
Given the limited availability of implantable organs scientists have developed methods of growing artificial organ_tissue in vitro1 by seeding cells onto support structures known as scaffolds or matrices
These scaffolds are engineered to allow cells to attach and grow while enabling the diffusion of vital cell nutrients to the cells to contribute to the growth of new functional tissue

Before the inventions of the asserted patents scientists created organ_tissue with scaffolds made of either `` permanent '' synthetic polymers or biodegradable non-synthetic materials like collagen
Preferably these scaffolds eventually would be absorbed by the body leaving behind the newly formed tissue
With the former method however the `` permanent '' synthetic matrix could not be absorbed by the body
Drawbacks of the latter collagen-based matrix included the inability to control the collagen structure 's configuration and the variable absorption of the collagen matrix by the surrounding tissue

It was also generally understood that in engineering thick organs like a liver or pancreas the cells at the center of the *1114 artificial structure tended to die as the cell density increased
This was due to the decreased diffusion rate of oxygen and nutrients to the inner cells at the center of the growing structure
These prior_art_methods of tissue engineering therefore were primarily used to make thinner organs such as artificial_skin

In the face of these challenges the inventors of the ¡¬193 and ¡¬830_patent s Drs
Vacanti and Langer developed biodegradable synthetic matrices that provide support for cell growth and enhance the formation of blood_vessels ( i.e. vascularization ) of the growing cell mass after implantation
The specifications of the ¡¬193 and ¡¬830_patent s state that `` [ t ] he design and construction of the scaffolding is of primary importance '' and that the scaffolding must be `` shaped to maximize surface area to allow adequate diffusion of nutrients and growth factors to the cells ''
¡¬193_patent_col. 6_ll._25 -27 ; ¡¬830_patent col. 10_ll._12 -15
While the prior_art_methods were generally used to grow only artificial_skin the scaffolding of the claimed invention can support the growth of organs with varying thicknesses
Indeed the specifications describe that an object of the invention is to `` provid [ e ] a variety of organs including skin liver kidneys blood_vessels nerves and muscles which functionally resemble the naturally occurring organ ''
