's motion for a preliminary_injunction precluding The Toro_Company and Exmark_Manufacturing_Co.

BACKGROUND
Metalcraft of Mayville Inc. d/b/a Scag_Power_Equipment ( `` Scag '' ) manufactures commercial riding lawnmowers
To improve its mowers Scag developed a suspended operator_platform which is disclosed and claimed in the '475_patent
The '475_patent discloses a suspended operator_platform for a ride-on lawnmower or other riding light_utility_vehicle connected to a rigid_chassis by a suspension_system
'475_patent at Abstract 2:33-34
The operator_platform supports the entire_body of the operator
Id.at 2:51-52
The suspension_system suspends the operator_platform from the chassis in a manner that *1363 isolates an operator from vibrations or shock loads generated by the mower during use or when driven over uneven terrain
Id.at 4:1-6
The operator_platform can suspend or isolate some controls from the rigid_chassis
Id.at 2:37-39
For example the patent teaches that the steering_controls may be mounted on the suspended platform
Id.at 2:39-41

Scag commercialized the system disclosed in the '475_patent in its Cheetah_line of lawnmowers
In 2015 both The Toro_Company and its wholly owned subsidiary Exmark_Manufacturing_Co. Inc. ( collectively `` Toro '' ) introduced riding lawnmowers with suspended operator_platforms to compete with Scag 's Cheetah_line
Toro introduced the platform as part of its new MyRIDE ( tm ) suspension_system and Exmark introduced the platform as an upgrade to its Lazer Z Series lawnmowers
It is undisputed that the steering_controls in Toro and Exmark 's riding lawnmowers are connected to the chassis not the operator_platform

On May_5,_2016 Scag filed an infringement_action against Toro in the Eastern_District of Wisconsin and simultaneously filed a motion for a preliminary_injunction to enjoin Toro from making using selling and offering to sell lawnmowers with platform_suspension_systems that infringe its '475_patent
On August 1 the district_court granted Scag 's motion for a preliminary_injunction
On August 4 Toro filed a notice of appeal and a motion to stay entry of the preliminary_injunction
The district_court denied Toro 's motion to stay entry of the injunction and granted Scag 's motion to set bond and enter the injunction order

Toro appeals the district_court 's grant of a preliminary_injunction
We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1292 ( a ) ( 1 ) and ( c ) ( 1 )
