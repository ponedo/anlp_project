Opinion
MICHEL Circuit_Judge
This appeal requires our determination of whether the patentee submitted sufficient evidence to preclude summary_judgment of invalidity for obviousness over an article published prior to the filing_date of the patent application
Oral argument was heard on July_12,_2001
Because we hold that the patentee raised a genuine_issue as to whether its reduction to practice preceded the publication of the article we reverse the grant of summary_judgment and remand for further proceedings

BACKGROUND
In 1991 Loral sued numerous Japanese electronics manufacturers and their U.S. distributors for infringement of claim 1 of its United States Patent No._3931,674 ( the ¡¬674_patent ) which claims a process for manufacturing a charge-coupled device ( `` CCD '' )
A CCD is an important component in electronic cameras that produces an electrical signal representing the image that is focused upon it
This signal can then be processed and displayed on a video monitor
In August 1995 the district_court severed and stayed Loral 's claims against the non-manufacturing_defendants leaving six manufacturing_defendants : Sony Sanyo Toshiba Hitachi NEC and OKI
The court ordered separate trials for each

Sony was the first and only defendant to go to trial
Over the course of five weeks in 1996 Loral and Sony tried the issues of validity and infringement to a jury
On February 14 1996 the jury returned a verdict finding that Sony did not prove invalidity of the asserted claims and that Loral had proven infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
Sony then moved for judgment as a matter of law ( `` JMOL '' ) or alternatively for a new trial

The district_court granted Sony 's motion for JMOL holding that no reasonable_jury could find that Sony infringed
See Loral_Fairchild_Corp. v. Victor_Co. of Japan 931_F.Supp._1014_(E.D.N.Y.1996) ( Loral_II )
One basis for the court 's decision was that Sony 's accused process could not infringe under the doctrine of equivalents because it had been disclosed in a journal article authored by Dr. Darrel Erb ( `` the Erb_reference '' ) and published on December 3 1973 prior to the February 8 1974 filing_date of the application that issued as the *1361 ¡¬674_patent
Id.at 1030 ( citing Wilson Sporting Goods Co. v. David Geoffrey & Assoc. 904_F.2d_677 683-85 14_USPQ2d_1942 1948-49 ( Fed.Cir.1990 ) ( patentee may not assert a range of equivalents for infringement purposes that includes the prior_art ) )
Although the jury had returned a special verdict form indicating that it found that the Erb_reference did not qualify as prior_art against the ¡¬674_patent the district_court concluded that no reasonable_jury could have done so
Loral_II 931 F.Supp.at 1031

On appeal we affirmed the grant of JMOL but solely on the ground that Loral 's allegations of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents were barred by prosecution history estoppel ; our decision did not address whether the Erb_reference is prior_art with respect to the ¡¬674_patent
Loral_Fairchild_Corp. v. Sony Corp. 181_F.3d_1313 1316_n._3 50_USPQ2d_1865 1876_n._3_(Fed.Cir.1999) ( Loral_III )
In response Loral maintained its actions against only those of the remaining manufacturing_defendants that it believed were literally infringing the ¡¬674_patent -Toshiba and NEC

On April_10,_2000 Toshiba and NEC each moved for summary_judgment that claim 1 is invalid as obvious in view of the Erb_reference which was asserted to be prior_art under ¡± 102 ( a )
The district_court held a two-day hearing on the motions
The court then issued a final judgment and an unpublished decision granting the motions holding that there was no genuine_issue as to the status of the Erb_reference as prior_art and that claim 1 was obvious in light of it
Loral_Fairchild_Corp. v. Victor_Co. of Japan Nos._92-0128 & 91-5056 ( E.D.N.Y
June_21,_2000 ) ( Toshiba I )
Loral filed a timely notice of appeal and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
