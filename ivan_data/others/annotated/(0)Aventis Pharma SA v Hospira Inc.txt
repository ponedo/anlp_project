United States Court of Appeals Federal Circuit
AVENTIS PHARMA S.A. and Sanofi-Aventis_U.S. LLC Plaintiffs-Appellants v. HOSPIRA INC. Defendant-Appellee and
Apotex_Inc. and Apotex_Corp. Defendants-Appellees
No._2011-1018
| April_9,_2012
Synopsis
Background : Patentee filed actions against competitors alleging infringement of patents directed toward composition of cancer drug docetaxel with reduced risk of alcohol_intoxication and anaphylactic_effects compared to prior_art
Actions were consolidated
Following bench_trial the United States District Court for the District of Delaware Gregory M. Sleet Chief Judge 743_F.Supp.2d_305 entered judgment in favor of competitors

Holdings : Patentee appealed The Court of Appeals Prost Circuit_Judge held that :

`` perfusion '' meant an injectable solution containing the active pharmaceutical ingredient and an aqueous infusion fluid ;

perfusion claim was invalid as obvious based on the prior_art ;

district_court acted within its discretion in granting competitors ' motions to amend pleadings after scheduling order deadline to add allegations related to inequitable_conduct ;

prior_art references withheld from Patent and Trademark Office ( PTO ) were necessarily but-for material as required to support defense that patents were unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct ; and

district_court 's finding that inventor acted with specific intent to deceive PTO in withholding prior_art references was not clearly erroneous

Affirmed

Opinion
PROST Circuit_Judge
Aventis_Pharma_S.A. and Sanofi-Aventis_U.S. L.L.C
( collectively `` Sanofi '' ) filed suit against Hospira Inc. ( `` Hospira '' ) and Apotex_Inc. and Apotex_Corp. ( collectively `` Apotex '' ) under 35 U.S.C.¡± 271 ( e ) for infringement of U.S. Patent Nos._5750,561 ( `` ¡¬561_patent `` ) and 5,714,512 ( `` ¡¬512_patent `` )
After a bench_trial the district *1328 court found inter alia that claim 5 of the ¡¬561_patent and claim 7 of the ¡¬512_patent were invalid for obviousness under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103 that claim 7 of the ¡¬512_patent was not infringed and that both the ¡¬561 and ¡¬512_patent s were unenforceable for inequitable_conduct
Sanofi has appealed
For the reasons set forth below we affirm

I
BACKGROUND
The ¡¬561 and ¡¬512_patent s are pharmaceutical patents related to the administration of the chemotherapy cancer drug docetaxel which is marketed under the brand-name Taxotere
The patents are assigned to Aventis_Pharma_S.A. and Sanofi-Aventis_U.S. L.L.C
is the holder of the New Drug Application for Taxotere
Docetaxel is a successor to the cancer drug paclitaxel marketed as Taxol and the composition for docetaxel was covered by now-expired U.S. Patent No._4814,470 ( `` ¡¬470_patent `` )
Both docetaxel and paclitaxel belong to the class of compounds known as taxanes

Taxanes are administered through an intravenous infusion accomplished by slowly delivering the drug in a diluted aqueous solution called a `` perfusion ''
Taxanes however have low solubility in water and tend to precipitate i.e. form solid clumps and come out of solution
To delay precipitation taxanes are mixed with additives like surfactants and ethanol ; these additives stabilize the perfusion and delay the amount of time before precipitation occurs
The taxane is combined with the additives to form a `` stock_solution '' which is then mixed into an injectable aqueous solution such as saline to form a perfusion

In the prior_art the surfactant Cremophor was used with taxanes to form the stock_solution but it was known to trigger serious allergic reactions including anaphylactic shock
¡¬561_patent col.1 ll.59-63 ; ¡¬512_patent col.2 ll.31-35
The ¡¬561 and ¡¬512_patent s relate to using surfactants other than Cremophor with docetaxel and decreasing the amount of ethanol to reduce alcohol_intoxication and anaphylactic_effects in patients
After Hospira and Apotex applied for U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( `` FDA '' ) approval to market generic versions of Taxotere Sanofi filed suit against them for infringement of the ¡¬561 and ¡¬512_patent s. Only claim 5 of the ¡¬ 561 patent and claim 7 of the ¡¬512_patent are at issue on appeal

The ¡¬561_patent is titled `` Compositions containing taxane_derivatives '' and describes taxane_compositions including a perfusion that avoids anaphylactic and alcohol_intoxication_manifestations
Claim 5 of the ¡¬561_patent recites : 5
A perfusion which contains approximately 1 mg/ml or less of compound of formula as defined in claim 1 and which contains less than 35 ml/1 of ethanol and less than 35 ml/1 of polysorbate wherein said perfusion is capable of being injected without anaphylactic or alcohol_intoxication_manifestations being associated therewith

The ¡¬512_patent is titled `` New compositions containing taxane_derivatives '' and discloses taxane_compositions with reduced ethanol
Claim 7 depends from claims 1_and_6
As corrected by a Certificate of Correction those claims recite : 1
A composition comprising a compound of the formula

?
*1329 in which Ar is unsubstituted phenyl R7 is phenyl or tert_butoxy R6 is hydrogen R5 is acetyloxy or hydroxy R3 and R4 taken together form an oxo radical R1 is hydroxy and R2 is hydrogen said composition being dissolved in a surfactant selected from polysorbate polyoxyethylated vegetable oil and polyethoxylated castor oil said composition being essentially free or free of ethanol
6
The composition of claim 1 wherein R5 is hydroxy and R7 is tert_butoxy
7
The composition of claim 6 wherein said surfactant is polysorbate
After a bench_trial the court found that claim 7 of the ¡¬512_patent was invalid as obvious and not infringed by Hospira or Apotex
With respect to claim 5 of the ¡¬561_patent the court found that Hospira and Apotex did infringe but concluded that the claim was obvious
The court also determined that the ¡¬512 and ¡¬561_patent s were unenforceable for inequitable_conduct
