Opinion
GAJARSA Circuit_Judge
Plaintiffs Abbott Laboratories and Central_Glass_Company ( collectively `` Abbott '' ) appeal from a judgment of noninfringement of U.S._Patent_No._5990,176 ( `` the ¡¬176_patent `` ) by the United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of Illinois
Defendants Baxter_Pharmaceutical Products Inc. and Baxter_Healthcare_Corp. ( collectively `` Baxter '' ) cross-appeal the district_court 's determination that the asserted claims are valid and its refusal to find unenforceability due to inequitable conduct
*1365 This is our second hearing of this case ; following our first we reversed the district_court 's claim construction and remanded for trial
Abbott_Labs
v. Baxter_Pharm
Prods. Inc. 334_F.3d_1274 ( Fed.Cir.2003 )
The district_court conducted a bench trial then further construed the claims at issue and found them valid and enforceable but not infringed
Abbott_Labs v. Baxter_Pharm
Prods. Inc. No._01- CV-1867 2005_WL_2347221 ( N.D.Ill
Sept. 26 2005 )
This appeal timely followed

Because we hold the asserted claims of the ¡¬176_patent to be anticipated by the disclosure in U.S._Patent_No._5684,211 ( `` the ¡¬211_patent `` ) we reverse the district_court 's validity judgment

BACKGROUND
A
The technology
Sevoflurane is a fast-acting highly effective inhalation anesthetic
However pure sevoflurane has a serious problem unknown at the time of its invention and original shipment : it degrades in the presence of Lewis_acids
Lewis_acids are essentially defined as any species with an empty electron orbit leading to electron affinity and are common enough that avoiding exposure of sevoflurane to Lewis_acids is quite difficult
Among the products of the degradation_reaction is hydrofluoric_acid which is highly dangerous if inhaled
¡¬176_patent col.1 ll.52-57
The original containers in which Abbott shipped its product had Lewis_acids exposed on their interiors
The hydrofluoric_acid thus produced etched the containers ' glass surfaces exposing even more Lewis_acids resulting in a vicious-cycle cascading reaction that seriously compromised Abbott 's product while on the shelf and forced a recall

After investigating the cause of the degradation Abbott discovered the source of the problem
It also found a solution : water mixed in with sevoflurane will bind to and deactivate Lewis_acids protecting the sevoflurane from the degradation_reaction
A deliberate addition of water to sevoflurane ran counter to the conventional wisdom at the time : previously Abbott had sought to minimize its product 's water content
Abbott filed a patent application on the degradation-preventing combination of water or other `` Lewis acid inhibitors '' with sevoflurane which issued as the ¡¬176_patent at issue here
