Opinion
LOURIE Circuit_Judge
In these consolidated patent infringement actions generic pharmaceutical manufacturers Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. Watson_Laboratories Inc. Sandoz Inc. Lupin_Ltd. and Lupin_Pharmaceuticals Inc. ( collectively the `` Defendants '' ) appeal from the final judgments of the United_States_District_Court for the District of Nevada in favor of Plaintiffs-Appellees Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Bayer_Schering_Pharma_AG ( collectively `` Bayer '' )
In particular the Defendants challenge the district_court 's entry of summary_judgment that asserted claims 13_and_15 of Bayer 's U.S. Patent RE37,564 ( the `` ¡¬564_patent `` ) are not invalid for obviousness in view of numerous cited prior art references

BACKGROUND
This case concerns pharmaceutical formulations and dosing regimens for combined oral contraceptive ( `` COC '' ) products
First introduced in 1960 COCs better known as birth control pills deliver synthetic hormones that regulate the natural_ovarian_cycle and prevent pregnancy
Specifically COCs comprise a progestin and an estrogen that together inhibit folliculogenesis-a stepwise hormone-directed process in which an ovarian follicle containing an immature oocyte ( i.e. an egg cell ) grows and develops for approximately the first two weeks of an ovarian cycle culminating in the release of a fertile oocyte at ovulation
The synthetic_progestin and estrogen provided in a COC suppress production of the natural hormones that drive folliculogenesis thus inhibiting ovulation and reducing the incidence of pregnancy in COC_users
The contraceptive effects depend on the continued presence of the inhibitory synthetic hormones ; folliculogenesis will commence if the synthetic_progestin and estrogen are withdrawn but can be abrogated if the hormones are reintroduced before ovulation occurs

To maintain synthetic hormone concentrations sufficient for sustained follicular suppression COCs are typically taken once daily and since their introduction most_COCs have been provided in 28-day 28-pill packs that align with the approximate length of a natural_ovarian_cycle
Early COCs relied on a 21/7 dosing regimen in which each monthly pill pack would include twenty-one active_pills containing synthetic_progestin and estrogen followed by seven placebo_pills containing no hormones
The seven-day placebo period also known as the pill-free_interval was originally included because it ( i ) triggered a `` withdrawal bleed '' that mimicked natural menstrual bleeding and was presumed to improve acceptance among COC_users and ( ii ) provided a regular break from synthetic hormone exposure that was thought to mitigate potential side effects
The 21/7 regimen persists in most_COCs on the market today

In addition to maintaining a pill-free_interval another strategy to reduce side effects has been to reduce the hormone dose provided in each pill
For example the first COCs provided relatively high daily doses of synthetic estrogen up to approximately 150 £gg per active pill
Deleterious side effects of COC use including thromboembolism nausea and bloating have been most strongly associated with synthetic estrogen exposure so the estrogen dose in particular has been progressively reduced over time
The first COC containing the synthetic estrogen ethinylestradiol ( `` EE '' ) at only 20 £gg per pill was approved for sale in the United_States in 1976

In the early 1990s Bayer began developing a low-dose COC containing 20 £gg_EE and the synthetic_progestin drospirenone ( `` DRSP '' ) to be administered with a reduced pill-free_interval
Lowering EE dosage to 20 £gg per pill limits undesirable side effects but it also results in weaker ovarian suppression compared to higher-dose_COCs
As such some ovarian activity and follicular maturation can persist in users of low-dose_COCs and any intake errors ( i.e. missed pills ) especially those that effectively lengthen the unregulated pill-free_interval could result in `` escape '' ovulation and unintended pregnancy
¡¬ 564 patent col. 2_l._38 -col. 3_l._6
To address the risk of escape ovulation for users of low-dose_COCs Bayer implemented 23/BIG_TOKEN__5_and_24__BIG_TOKEN /4 dosing regimens reducing the pill-free_interval to five or four days respectively *1372 and increasing the number of active_pills per cycle accordingly
Bayer demonstrated that shortening the pill-free_interval to four or five days improved the contraceptive efficacy of low-dose COC formulations
Accordingly Bayer filed its first patent application directed to such low-dose extended-regimen COCs on December 22 1993 and that application eventually led to the ¡¬564_patent1 The ¡¬564_patent includes 15 claims reciting various COC preparations ; claims 13_and_15 read as follows :

13
A combination product for oral contraception comprising
( a ) 23_or_24 daily dosage_units each containing 0.020 mg of ethinylestradiol and 2.BIG_TOKEN__5_to_3__BIG_TOKEN0 mg of drospirenone and
( b ) 5_or_4 respectively active ingredient-free placebo_pills or other_indications to show that the daily administration of the 23_or_24 dosage_units respectively is to be followed by 5_or_4 respectively pill-free or placebo pill days wherein each of the dosage_units containing drospirenone contains the same amount of drospirenone
... 15
A combination preparation of claim 13 which comprises 24 dosage_units and 4 placebo_pills or other_indications to show that no dosage unit or placebo pill is administered during the last 4 days of the menstrual cycle
¡¬564_patent col. 6_l._57 -col. 8_l._4
Bayer markets a COC product that embodies claims 13_and_15 under the brand name YAZTHE_R
That product includes four placebo_pills and twenty-four active_pills each containing 20 £gg_EE and 3 mg DRSP
Bayer received final approval to market YAZTHE_R in the United_States on March_16,_2006
The Defendants filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications ( `` ANDAs '' ) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( `` FDA '' ) seeking approval to market generic versions of YAZTHE_R
Those ANDA_filings included Paragraph IV certifications asserting that the ¡¬564_patent is invalid
See 21 U.S.C.¡± 355 ( j ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ( vii ) ( IV ) ( 2006 )
Bayer responded by bringing patent infringement actions alleging that the Defendants ' ANDA_filings infringed claims 13_and_15 of the ¡¬564_patent under 35 U.S.C.¡± 271 ( e ) ( 2 )2

Before the district_court the Defendants conceded that their ANDAs infringed the ¡¬564_patent under ¡± 271 ( e ) ( 2 )

The Defendants responded and counterclaimed however that the asserted claims of the ¡¬564_patent were invalid for obviousness in view of numerous prior art references
Each side moved for summary_judgment on the obviousness issue and the district_court granted Bayer 's motions holding that the asserted claims of the ¡¬564_patent were not invalid *1373 in view of the cited prior art
