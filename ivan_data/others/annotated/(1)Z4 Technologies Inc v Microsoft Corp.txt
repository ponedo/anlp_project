* Synopsis
Background : Assignee of patents related to prevention of software_piracy sued competitor for infringement
After jury found that competitor had infringed patents and did not prove that patents were invalid the United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Texas Leonard Davis J. 2006_WL_2401099 denied competitor 's renewed motions for judgment as a matter of law and motion for new_trial
Competitor appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Linn Circuit_Judge held that :

as used in patent_claims term `` user '' meant `` a person or a person using a computer '' ;

substantial_evidence supported jury_verdict finding of infringement of `` user '' limitation even under modified claim construction ;

substantial_evidence supported finding of infringement of patent_claims ' `` password '' and `` authorization_code '' limitations ;

patents ' `` automatic '' and `` electronic '' claim limitations did not require that initiation of registration communication commence without any user interaction ;

substantial_evidence supported jury 's determination that patents were not invalid for anticipation ;

erroneous instruction did not warrant new_trial on issue of anticipation ; and

refusing to give competitor 's requested jury instruction was not abuse of discretion

Affirmed

** Opinion
*1344 LINN Circuit_Judge
Microsoft_Corporation ( `` Microsoft '' ) appeals from a final judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Texas z4 Techs. Inc. v. Microsoft_Corp. No._06-_cv-142 2006_WL_2401099 ( E.D.Tex
Aug. 18 2006 )
The district_court denied Microsoft 's renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law ( `` JMOL '' ) following a jury_trial in which the jury found that Microsoft had infringed z4 Technologies Inc. 's ( `` z4 's '' ) U.S
Patents No._6044,471 ( `` the ¡¬471_patent `` ) and No._6785,825 ( `` the ¡¬825_patent `` ) and had failed to prove these patents invalid

Aug. 18 2006 ) ( `` JMOL_Opinion `` )
Because substantial_evidence supports the jury 's verdict and because the district_court did not abuse its discretion in denying Microsoft 's motion for a new_trial we affirm

I
BACKGROUND
z4 is the assignee of two patents related to the prevention of software_piracy
The inventor of these patents David Colvin ( `` Colvin '' ) founded and owns z4
The ¡¬825_patent_claims priority to the ¡¬471_patent through continuation applications and thus shares an effective filing date of June_4,_1998
Because these patents also share a common specification we will refer generically to `` the specification '' in reference to both the ¡¬471 and ¡¬825_patent s. These patents are directed specifically to the problem of `` illicit copying and unauthorized use '' of computer software
¡¬825_patent col.1 ll.21-25
The patent specification explains that `` [ t ] he advent of the Internet has contributed to the proliferation of pirated software known as 'warez ' which is easily located and readily downloaded ''
Id
col.1 ll.33-35
Prior art solutions to this problem were either easily circumvented or imposed substantial burdens on the consumer
For example requiring the entry of a serial_number was `` easily defeated by transferring the serial_number.. to one or more unauthorized_users ''
Id
col.1 ll.45-51
Similarly the use of `` hardware keys '' which must be physically present to enable the software proved `` relatively expensive for the developer and cumbersome for the authorized user ''
Id
col.1 ll.36-44

z4 's invention `` controls the number of copies of authorized software by monitoring registration_information '' and by `` [ r ] equiring authorized users to periodically update a password or authorization_code provided by a password administrator ''
¡¬471_patent col.3 ll.15-24
More particularly the patents disclose a multi-step user authorization scheme whereby an initial password or authorization_code grants the user a `` grace_period '' for a fixed number of uses or period of time
Users must then submit registration_information to a representative of the software developer to receive a second password or authorization_code which is required to enable the product for use beyond this grace_period
In the patented system users are able to choose between a manual registration mode and an automatic or electronic registration mode
Upon receipt of the registration_information the software_representative compares the submitted information to previously-stored registration_information and determines whether the user is authorized
If the user is not authorized the software_representative may disable the software

On September 22 2004 z4 sued Microsoft and Autodesk Inc. ( `` Autodesk '' ) 1 alleging infringement of claim 32 of the ¡¬471_patent and claims 44_and_131 of the ¡¬825_patent
Claim 32 of the ¡¬471_patent reads *1345 as follows with disputed portions highlighted :

32
A computer readable storage medium having data stored therein representing software executable by a computer the software including instructions to reduce use of the software by unauthorized_users the storage medium comprising : instructions for requiring a password associated with the software ; instructions for enabling the software after the password has been communicated to the software ; instructions for subsequently requiring a new password to be communicated to the software for continued_operation of the software ; and instructions for automatically contacting an authorized representative of the software to communicate registration_information and obtaining authorization for continued_operation of the software
Claims 44_and_131 of the ¡¬825_patent are identical for purposes of this appeal
They differ only in their definition of the `` initial_authorization_period '' or grace_period
Claim 44 reads as follows with disputed portions highlighted : 44
A method for reducing unauthorized software use the method comprising : providing a representative to monitor software license compliance ; associating a first_authorization_code with the software the first_authorization_code enabling the software on a computer for use by a user for an initial_authorization_period the initial_authorization_period being based on usage of the software ; supplying the first_authorization_code with the software ; requiring the user to enter the first_authorization_code to at least partially enable the software on the computer for use by the user during the initial_authorization_period ; requiring the user to contact the representative for retrieval of at least one additional_authorization_code to repeat the enablement of the software on the computer for use by the user during a subsequent_authorization_period beyond the initial_authorization_period and allowing the repeat of the enablement of the software to be performed prior to the expiration of the initial_authorization_period so the enablement of the software can be continuous from the initial_authorization_period to the subsequent_authorization_period the software being enabled on the computer for use by the user during the subsequent_authorization_period beyond the initial_authorization_period requiring without further communication with the representative following entry of the at least one additional_authorization_code ; requiring the user to selectively choose either manual or electronic registration and provide registration_information to the representative prior to retrieval of the at least one additional_authorization_code the registration_information including computer specific information ; comparing previously stored registration_information related to at least one of the software the user and the computer with the registration_information provided by the user to the representative to determine if the user is an authorized or an unauthorized_user ; and.at least partially disabling the software if the user [ sic ] an unauthorized_user

In the litigation z4 alleged that Microsoft 's `` Product Activation '' feature as implemented in its `` Office '' group of software applications and its `` Windows '' operating system infringed each of the asserted claims beginning in 2000_and_2001 respectively
Microsoft countered that it did not *1346 infringe z4 's patents that the ¡¬471 and ¡¬825_patent s were invalid for anticipation and obviousness and that both patents were unenforceable due to inequitable conduct by Colvin
In particular Microsoft contended that it had developed its own technology to reduce software_piracy called the Licensing Verification Program ( `` LVP '' ) which it implemented in its 1998 Brazilian Publisher ( `` BP 98 '' ) software product
Because this product was released prior to the filing date of z4 's patents Microsoft alleged that it constituted a prior invention sufficient to invalidate the asserted claims

A magistrate judge held a Markman hearing and subsequently construed several disputed claim terms
z4 Techs. Inc. v. Microsoft_Corp. No._06-_cv-142 2005_WL_2304993_(E.D.Tex._Sep._20,_2005) ( `` Claim Construction Opinion `` )
Later during the course of the jury_trial the court construed an additional term `` user '' which had become central to Microsoft 's litigation arguments
z4 Techs. Inc. v. Microsoft_Corp. No._06-_cv-142 ( E.D.Tex
Apr._12,_2006 ) ( `` Supplemental Claim Construction Opinion `` )
The jury returned a verdict of willful_infringement of all three asserted claims against Microsoft and awarded damages of $ 115 million

Following the jury_verdict Microsoft filed various renewed motions for JMOL under Rule 50 ( b ) and a motion for a new_trial under Rule 59 ( a ) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
The district_court denied all of Microsoft 's motions for JMOL and a new_trial thereby upholding the jury 's verdict in its entirety
The district_court also held both patents to be enforceable
JMOL_Opinion at 2
It declined however to issue a permanent injunction against Microsoft
See z4 Techs. Inc. v. Microsoft_Corp. 434_F.Supp.2d_437_(E.D.Tex.2006)

Based on the jury 's finding of willful_infringement z4 requested enhanced damages
Although the district_court chose not to enhance damages to the maximum of three times the jury_verdict it did award an additional $ 25 million against Microsoft
JMOL_Opinion at 47
It also awarded attorney 's fees to z4 based on the jury 's willfulness verdict and its own determination of litigation misconduct by Microsoft
Id.at 43
Microsoft timely appealed
We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
