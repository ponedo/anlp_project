Opinion
*1315 NEWMAN Circuit_Judge
Mr. Nouri E. Hakim sued Cannon Avent Group PLC Cannon_Rubber_Limited and Avent_America Inc. ( together `` Avent '' ) in the United_States_District_Court for the Western_District of Louisiana asserting infringement of Hakim 's United States Patents No._6321,931 ( the ¡¬931_patent ) and No._6357,620 ( the ¡¬620_patent ) by Avent 's leak-resistant_drinking_cups
The district_court granted Avent 's motions for summary_judgment that the ¡¬931_patent is not infringed and the ¡¬620_patent is invalid.1 We affirm these judgments

THE ¡¬931_PATENT
The Hakim inventions are for drinking cups that prevent the spilling of liquid if the cup is tipped over
Hakim 's patented cups have a valve through which fluid can pass when suction is applied by a person by way of a drinking_spout whereby the valve closes to seal the cup when a person is not drinking
The specification of the ¡¬931_patent describes the preferred_embodiment as having a dual sealing mechanism that provides an `` extremely secure_seal '' against spillage : In accordance with the invention an improved cup construction and valve_assembly is provided which provides an extremely secure_seal against accidental liquid flow from the cup_spout
Further to the invention a user places his or her mouth against the spout of the cup assembly to suck liquid out of the cup when desired
The act of sucking at the spout of the cup creates negative_pressure or a partial vacuum against a valve in the cup_spout causing the valve to invert or turn inside out either partially or totally thereby unblocking an opening such as an orifice or slit in the valve
Once the opening is unblocked liquid can flow freely through the valve and spout
In contrast when not in use the valve sits in a resting closed_position with the valve pressed against the center_seal-off thereby sealing off the opening or slit in the valve_assembly
Thus in its relaxed state with no negative_pressure applied the valve sits in a closed_position with the fluid opening sealed by the center_seal-off
Moreover in accordance with the dual valve nature of the device in the preferred_embodiment an adjacent valve similarly seals when no negative_pressure is applied thereby blocking off the air vents in the cover of the cup and further preventing the possibility of fluid flow
Consequently the closed_position provides an extremely secure_seal against fluid leakage such that inadvertent spills or even deliberate attempts to force liquid outside of the cup such as by turning the cup upside down or shaking the cup are ineffective
¡¬931_Patent col. 1 line 51 to col. 2 line 10

During patent prosecution Hakim described his distinctions from the cited references as follows : Thus two separate mechanisms are both used to close off the passage of liquid through the valve when not in use
The first mechanism involves an inverting flexible_valve_material which has a slit therein and responds to suction
The second mechanism involves the use of a blocking element which is impenetrable to the passage of liquid
The slit sits against the blocking element sealing or blocking off the slit to yet further prevent the passage of liquid through the valve
... By providing both the elastomeric member with a slit and a blocking element *1316 a sealing mechanism is provided which reduces spillage beyond that of either mechanism alone
None of the references cited in the Office Action [ Robbins III Bachman and Belcastro ] teach or suggest such a no-spill mechanism having a slit sitting against a blocking element such as is recited in all of the pending claims
¡¬931 Application Response Oct._2,_2000 ( emphases added )
Thus during prosecution the presence of the slit in the flexible_valve_material was emphasized as distinguishing all of the claims from the cited references

Avent 's accused drinking cup has a valve with a flexible diaphragm having a central opening but the opening is not a slit that opens and closes but simply a hole in the diaphragm
The diaphragm rests against a plastic mount that has a conical_head that seals the hole
Upon suction by a person seeking to drink the diaphragm is lifted off the conical_head exposing the hole and permitting fluid to flow from the cup to the drinking_spout

The district_court held on summary_judgment that Avent 's device did not infringe the ¡¬931_claims based on the claim_construction that limited the ¡¬931_claims to a sealing mechanism that includes a flexible_valve_material or diaphragm having a slit
Hakim I at *1 ( `` For the reasons contained in the Report and Recommendation of the Magistrate_Judge previously filed herein and after a de novo review of the entire record and the written objections filed herein and concurring with the Magistrate_Judge 's findings under the applicable law '' ; summary_judgment was granted )
Mr. Hakim argues that the claim_construction is excessively constricted and that all of the ¡¬931_claims do not require a slit that opens and closes with pressure for claims 1_and_2 use the word `` opening '' not `` slit '' for the aperture in the diaphragm
Claim 1 is as follows : 1
An apparatus for use in a no-spill drinking cup said apparatus comprising : a valve holder such valve holder comprising at least one valve and a blocking element said valve comprising a flexible_material said blocking element comprising an area of material which is impenetrable to the flow of liquid said valve further comprising an opening through said flexible_material said valve having a resting position wherein said flexible_material sits with said opening against said blocking element such that said valve is closed to the passage of liquid through said valve said valve moving into an open_position for the passage of liquid through said valve upon the application of negative air pressure to the top of said valve said open_position being a position wherein said flexible member comprising said opening lifts off of said blocking element
( Emphasis added )
The word `` opening '' was placed in claims 1_and_2 when Hakim filed a continuation_application after receiving a notice of allowance for claims wherein the word `` slit '' appeared instead of `` opening ''
The filing of the continuation was accompanied by an attorney letter stating that Hakim was broadening claims 1_and_2 and an amendment changing `` slit '' to `` opening '' in claims 1_and_2
The continuation_claims were allowed without any comment or rejection by the examiner
However in construing the claims of the continuation patent the district_court held Hakim to his arguments in the parent_application that the invention includes the presence of a slit in the flexible_material
The court stated : `` Because Hakim did not retract any of his arguments distinguishing the prior_art he is held to the restrictive claim_construction he argued during prosecution of the patent ''
Hakim I at *5 ( adopted Magistrate 's Report )

*1317 Hakim argues that the district_court improperly relied on the argument in the abandoned parent_application
Hakim states that by re-filing the application with broader_claims he avoided any unnecessary restriction that may have crept into the prior prosecution
He states that he informed the examiner that the new_claims were broader than those previously allowed and that when the examiner allowed the new_claims without rejection there is a presumption that the examiner had assured himself of the patentability of the new_claims
See United States v. Chemical Foundation 272_U.S._1 14-15 47_S.Ct._1 71_L.Ed._131_(1926) ( `` The presumption of regularity supports the official acts of public officers and in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary courts presume that they have properly discharged their official duties '' )
Hakim states that he did what was appropriate when he flagged this change to assist the examiner and that the claims as granted should not be unnecessarily narrowed by the court

Avent states that the totality of the prosecution_history nonetheless limits Hakim to the embodiment with the slit for the magistrate judge found : `` The prosecution_history makes perfectly clear that Hakim specifically distinguished his invention from the prior_art by limiting it to an apparatus with both ( 1 ) a slit which closes when suction is not applied and ( 2 ) a second closure consisting of a blocking element which the slit rests against ''
Hakim I at *5 ( adopted Magistrate 's Report )
Avent states that this was and is the distinction from the prior_art and that the claims are properly limited to this feature whether they use the word `` slit '' or the word `` opening ''
Avent stresses that when Hakim wrote to the examiner that he was broadening the claims he did not specifically point out that he no longer intended to be limited to the specific mechanism that he had previously argued was the distinguishing feature of his invention

Hakim points out that a patent applicant is not precluded from filing a continuation_application with broader_claims
It is recognized that an applicant can broaden as well as restrict his claims during the procedures of patent examination and that continuing applications may present broader_claims than were allowed in the parent
Cf
Symbol Technologies Inc. v. Lemelson Medical Education & Research Found. 422_F.3d_1378 1385 ( Fed.Cir.2005 ) ( `` Commonly and justifiably one might refile an application to add subject_matter in order to attempt to support broader_claims as the development of an invention progresses although entitlement to an earlier filing date for any claimed subject_matter may of course be necessary to avoid a statutory bar created by intervening events outlined in 35 U.S.C.¡±¡± 102_and_103
`` )

Hakim had the right to refile the application and attempt to broaden the claims
See id.at 1385 ( `` One may also refile an application even in the absence of any of these reasons [ refiling an application in response to a requirement for restriction ; refiling in order to present evidence that may not have previously existed ; or refiling to support broader_claims as the development of an invention progresses ] provided that such refiling is not unduly successive or repetitive '' )
However an applicant can not recapture claim_scope that was surrendered or disclaimed
The district_court did not err in holding that the examiner 's action in allowing the continuation_claims without further prosecution was based on the prosecution argument in the parent
See Omega Engineering Inc. v. Raytek Corp. 334_F.3d_1314 1324 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) ( `` The doctrine of prosecution disclaimer is well established in Supreme Court precedent precluding patentees from recapturing through claim interpretation specific *1318 meanings disclaimed during prosecution '' )
( citing Schriber-Schroth Co. v. Cleveland Trust Co. 311_U.S._211 220-21 61_S.Ct._235 85_L.Ed._132_(1940) Crawford v. Heysinger 123_U.S._589 602-04 8_S.Ct._399 31_L.Ed._269_(1887) and Goodyear Dental Vulcanite Co. v. Davis 102_U.S._222 227 26_L.Ed._149_(1880) )
Although a disclaimer made during prosecution can be rescinded permitting recapture of the disclaimed scope the prosecution_history must be sufficiently clear to inform the examiner that the previous disclaimer and the prior_art that it was made to avoid may need to be re-visited
See Springs Window Fashions LP v. Novo Indus. L.P. 323_F.3d_989 995 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) ( `` The public notice function of a patent and its prosecution_history requires that a patentee be held to what he declares during the prosecution of his patent
A patentee may not state during prosecution that the claims do not cover a particular device and then change position and later sue a party who makes that same device for infringement
`` )

The district_court correctly ruled that the word `` opening '' is not correctly construed to eliminate the sealing mechanism provided by the slitted diaphragm
On this construction the summary_judgment of noninfringement of the ¡¬931_patent was correct and is affirmed
