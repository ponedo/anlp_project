United States Court of Appeals Federal Circuit
BROADCOM CORPORATION Plaintiff-Appellee v. EMULEX CORPORATION Defendant-Appellant
No._2012-1309
| Oct._7,_2013
Synopsis
Background : Patentee commenced action against competitor alleging infringement of patent directed toward communication device configured to receive multiple serial data_signals
The United_States_District_Court for the Central_District of California James V. Selna J. granted judgment of infringement and entered permanent_injunction against competitor
Competitor appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Rader Chief_Judge held that :

half-rate architecture in accused products `` correspond [ ed ] to a frequency offset '' as required by claim in patent ;

evidence was sufficient to show that competitor infringed `` at a rate so as to reduce '' limitation ;

patent was not obvious ;

substantial_evidence supported jury 's finding of commercial success ;

jury 's finding of long-felt but unsolved need was supported by substantial_evidence ;

patentee 's exclusion from fair opportunity to compete for design wins constituted irreparable harm ; and

district_court did not abuse its discretion in issuing permanent_injunction with 18 month sunset period

Affirmed

Before RADER Chief_Judge LOURIE and WALLACH Circuit Judges
Opinion
RADER Chief_Judge
After a trial and post-trial motions the United_States_District_Court for the Central_District of California determined that Emulex Corporation ( Emulex ) infringed Broadcom Corporation 's ( Broadcom ) U.S. Patent No._7058,150 ( the ¡¬150_patent )
On appeal the only issues remaining relate to the ¡¬150_patent and the district_court 's grant of a permanent_injunction and modifications to that permanent_injunction
Second Amended Notice of Appeal Broadcom Corp. v. Emulex Corp. No._2012-1309 ( Fed.Cir
August 10 2012 ) ( No._43 )
Upon review of the record this court affirms the district_court 's finding that Emulex infringed the ¡¬150_patent
Similarly this court affirms the district_court 's determination that the ¡¬150_patent would not have been obvious at the time of invention and hence invalid
Finally because the district_court properly exercised its discretion in granting a permanent_injunction with a well-crafted sunset period this court also affirms that determination

I
This case concerns digital communication systems with data transceivers capable of receiving multiple analog high-speed serial data_signals
¡¬ 150 patent Abstract col. 2 ll.17-26
Once received the analog data_signal needs to be converted into a digital signal through a process called `` sampling ''
Sampling is the process of measuring the amplitude of the analog_signal at precisely timed intervals in order to extract the data carried in the analog_signal
To do so the receiver needs a way to discern the proper rate at which to sample the analog_signal and needs a means for generating a sampling signal having the appropriate frequency
In addition when data is sent through cables over long distances the incoming signal frequency can vary over time
To compensate for such variances receiver circuits adjust the sampling signal to match the frequency and phase of the incoming_data_signal
Circuits for aligning and sampling data in this manner are known as Clock/Data Recovery ( CDR ) circuits

The ¡¬150_patent discusses that communication devices with transceivers for transmitting and receiving data_signals were known in the art
¡¬150_patent_col. 1_ll._18 -25
And integrating transceiver_circuits on an integrated circuit ( IC ) chip to reduce size and power dissipation of the transceiver was also known in the art
¡¬150_patent_col. 1_ll._26 -28
The circuits typically operate in accordance with timing signals such as sampling signals generated by oscillators
*1329 ¡¬150_patent_col. 1_ll._26 -41
Because there are multiple transceiver_circuits on an IC_chip there are also multiple_oscillators on a common IC_chip
¡¬150_patent_col. 1_ll._26 -41
However the presence of multiple_oscillators on one IC_chip can cause one oscillator to deleteriously influence the operation of another oscillator
¡¬150_patent_col. 1_ll._37 -47
Thus the need to integrate transceiver_circuits on an IC_chip and the related need to reduce the number of oscillators on the IC_chip were long felt by those of skill in the art
¡¬150_patent_col. 1_ll._42 -47

To reliably process a data_signal a receiver needs to match its operating characteristics with the characteristics of the data_signal
¡¬150_patent_col. 1_ll._48 -50
To do so it was known in the art to employ a receiver that uses a sampling signal to sample the data_signal at sample times to produce optimal data recovery and thus minimize errors
¡¬150_patent_col. 1_ll._48 -55
Such timing control includes control of the phase and frequency of a sampling signal used to sample the received data_signal
¡¬150_patent_col. 1_ll._59 -61

Sampling of high data rate signals also presented challenges
¡¬150_patent_col. 2_ll._7 -9
In prior art systems as the received data_signal rate increased into the multigigabit-per-second range the difficulty in effectively controlling sampling processes in the receiver correspondingly increased
¡¬ 150 patent col. 1_ll._62 -66
At lower rates the sampling proceeds by making multiple copies of the same high-speed signal and distributing those copies to several sampling circuits operating in parallel
¡¬150_patent_col. 29_l._65 -col. 30_l._6

The ¡¬150_patent solves the problems in the prior art by using a phase_interpolator to perform high speed sampling of a signal using a technique known as clock and data recovery
Specifically the ¡¬150_patent addresses the sampling problem at high data rates by using four parallel data paths each operating at a quarter of the rate of the incoming_data_signal
¡¬150_patent_col. 31_ll._10 -37
Further to solve the problems related to the presence of multiple_oscillators on an IC_chip the ¡¬150_patent eliminates the need for multiple_oscillators by `` advantageously '' using a single master oscillator `` in a multiple receiver '' environment on an IC_chip
¡¬150_patent_col. 3_ll._22 -40

The invention thus relies on a single master oscillator because the phase_interpolator not the oscillator tunes the phase and frequency of the sampling signal
¡¬150_patent_col. 3_ll._22 -25
Instead of changing the oscillator frequency the ¡¬150_patent discloses adjusting the phase of the sampling signal forward or backward so that the sampling rate i.e. the number of rising edges per unit time matches the data rate
¡¬150_patent_col. 23_ll._15 -41
For a change in phase to cause the same ultimate result as a change in frequency the phase must be continually `` rotated '' at a specific rate-otherwise the sampling signal will not keep up with the desired sampling frequency
¡¬150_patent_col. 23_ll._17 -55
