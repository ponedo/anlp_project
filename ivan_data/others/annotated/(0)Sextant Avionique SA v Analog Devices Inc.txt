Nos._98-1063 98-1077
| Feb._26,_1999
Synopsis
Patentee brought action against competitor alleging infringement of patents for accelerometers
The United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of California Susan Illston J. granted summary_judgment for competitor on claim of literal infringement and granted judgment as a matter of law on claim of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
Patentee appealed
The Court of Appeals Lourie Circuit_Judge held that : ( 1 ) term `` metallization '' in patents referred to a deposited metallic material and patents were thus not literally infringed by device that used doped silicon materials ; ( 2 ) patentee was barred by prosecution_history_estoppel from asserting as to first patent that use of doped silicon on capacitor_plates was equivalent to patentee 's `` metallization '' limitation ; ( 3 ) as to second patent amendment of claim to include `` metallization '' limitation was presumptively related to patentability such that prosecution_history_estoppel was applicable ; and ( 4 ) presumption that amendment was related to patentability precluded any claim that accused device had element equivalent to `` metallization '' limitation

BACKGROUND
A. Sextant 's `` Marcillat '' and `` Boura '' Patents
Sextant 's patents pertain generally to accelerometers which are small devices capable of detecting acceleration and which find utility in avionic and automotive applications
The first of Sextant 's patents at issue in this appeal *820 U.S. Patent 4,663,972 was issued to inventor Gerard Marcillat on March_6,_1985
One embodiment disclosed in the Marcillat patent shows a `` test_body '' 6 connected to and supported by two `` flexible_blades '' 4_and_5
The flexible_blades are anchored at their `` lower ends '' to a `` fixed part ''
The test_body further comprises `` lateral edges '' 16_and_17 having metallized edges 18_and_19
The fixed part comprises two `` wings '' 20_and_21 having metallized edges 22_and_23
This configuration thus produces two capacitors the first formed by plates 19_and_22 the second by plates 18_and_23 with air gaps in between the capacitor_plates
This embodiment is shown in Figure 2 of Marcillat :
