Opinion
Newman Circuit_Judge
*1137 Chikezie_Ottah ( herein `` Ottah '' ) appeals the decision of the United_States_District_Court for the Southern_District of New_York.1 The district_court granted summary_judgment of non-infringement to several defendant automobile companies with respect to U.S. Patent No._7152,840 ( `` the '840_Patent `` ) and dismissed the complaint with prejudice as to several other automobile companies
We have reviewed and now affirm the district_court 's rulings

BACKGROUND
The '840_Patent is entitled `` Book Holder '' and describes the invention as `` a removable book_holder assembly for use by a person in a protective or mobile structure such as a car seat wheelchair walker or stroller ''
'840_Patent at col._1,_ll._6-9
The book_holder is described as `` having an adjustable releasable clipping means and a support arm configured for.. adjustment of the book supporting surface of the book_holder to hold a book in a readable position in front of the user ''
Id.at col._1,_ll._9-13

In the `` Background of the Invention '' the '840_Patent recites disadvantages associated with prior art book_holders such as `` [ t ] he book_holders in the prior art lack the ease of application to a mobile_vehicle such as a wheelchair or stroller to allow the reader to have mobility to explore their environment in a stationary sitting or reclining position while reading a book supported on the mobile device ''
Id.at col._1,_ll._48-53
The '840_Patent recites ten `` object [ s ] of the present invention '' including `` provid [ ing ] a book_holder that can be easily and removably attached to and removed from a bar or portion of the mobile_vehicle without tools ''
Id.at col._1,_ll._64-67
Eight of the ten objects refer to the advantages of a holder for books one refers to a writing board and one refers to the removable_attachment of the mounting structures
Id.at col._1,_l._64 - col._2,_l._34

Claim 1 the only claim of the '840_Patent reads : 1
A book_holder for removable_attachment the book_holder comprising : a book_support_platform the book_support_platform comprising a front_surface a rear_surface and a plurality of *1138 clamps the front_surface adapted for supporting a book the plurality of clamps disposed on the front_surface to engage and retain the book to the book_support_platform the rear_surface separated from the front_surface ; a clasp comprising a clip_head a clip_body and a pair of resilient clip arms the clip arms adjustably mounted on the clip_head the clip_head attached to the clip_body ; and
an arm comprising a first_end and a second_end and a telescoping arrangement the clasp on the first_end the second_end pivotally attached to the book_support_platform the telescoping arrangement interconnecting the first_end [ to ] the second_end the clasp spaced from the book_support_platform wherein the book_holder is removably attached and adjusted to a reading position by the telescoping arrangement axially adjusting the spaced relation between the book_support_platform and the clasp and the pivotal connection on the book_support_platform pivotally adjusting the front_surface with respect to the arm
Id.at col._6,_ll._14-38

The specification describes the claimed book_holder and its removable_attachment
Relevant to this suit the specification concludes with the statement that the book_holder may be used to hold items other than books : `` The book platform 12 may also be used to support such items as audio/video equipment PDAs or mobile phones cameras computers musical instruments toys puzzles and games
The panel 16 may be provided with a set of mounting positions for receiving and/or mounting the above items ( NOT SHOWN ) ''
Id.at col._5,_ll._35-40
The specification further states : Although the invention has been described above in connection with particular embodiments and examples it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the invention is not necessarily so limited and that numerous other embodiments examples uses modification and departures from the embodiments examples and uses are intended to be encompassed by the claims attached hereto
Id.at col._6,_ll._1-7
The only embodiment that is described and illustrated is for use as a book_holder

In the Second Amended Complaint filed in the district_court Ottah states `` I invented a mobile camera '' and `` [ t ] he defendant BMW et al are manufacturing using/making the product
Using and selling it
Whereby infringing on the patent ''
Second Amended Complaint ?
C Appellee 's Appx80

Several defendants including General_Motors_LLC ; Mazda Motor Corporation ; Nissan Motors Company Limited ; Fuji Heavy Industries ; Daimler_AG ; and Toyota Motor Corporation ( collectively the `` MTD_Defendants '' ) moved to dismiss on the grounds of failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted and for misjoinder
The MTD_Defendants argued that the '840_Patent 's claim is explicit to a book_holder and thus Ottah can not plead a plausible claim for infringement by a camera_holder

Several other defendants including Fiat Chrysler ; Ford_Motor_Company ; Hyundai_Motor_America ; Jaguar_Land_Rover_North_America ; and Kia Motor America ( collectively the `` MSJ_Defendants '' ) moved for summary_judgment of non-infringement
The MSJ_Defendants argued that their camera_holders did not meet the `` removable_attachment '' limitation of claim 1 because the camera_holders on their vehicles can not be removed without tools

The district_court granted the MTD_Defendants ' motion to dismiss with prejudice *1139 characterizing Ottah 's arguments as `` legally implausible ''
Dist
Ct
Op. 230 F.Supp.3d at 196
The court observed that the '840_Patent 's claim is for a book_holder and does not claim a camera_holder or any of a camera 's components or functions

The district_court also granted the MSJ_Defendants ' motion for summary_judgment of non-infringement
Id.at 198
The court observed that the Federal_Circuit has previously ruled on the scope of the '840_Patent 's claim holding that the claim requires that any infringing device must be capable of being `` removed without tools ''
Id.at 197 ( citing Ottah v. VeriFone Sys. Inc. 524_Fed.Appx._627 629 ( Fed
Cir
2013 ) ) ( `` VeriFone '' )
The court observed that the MSJ_Defendants submitted uncontroverted_evidence that their accused cameras were mounted in such a way that tools were necessary to remove them
Id.at 197

The district_court also rejected Ottah 's argument of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents finding that this equivalency argument was foreclosed by this court 's prior claim construction which was informed by Ottah 's representations during prosecution
Id.at 197-98
Additionally the district_court found that the MSJ_Defendants submitted uncontroverted_evidence that their accused cameras did not meet the telescoping arm and adjustability limitations of the '840_Patent
Id.at 198 n.6
The court held that these undisputed facts also require summary_judgment of non-infringement in favor of the MSJ_Defendants

Ottah appeals as to all defendants arguing that the district_court erred in all respects
