Competitor appealed
The Court of Appeals Gajarsa Circuit_Judge held that : ( 1 ) competitor 's assertion that accused device merely practiced the prior_art or that which would have been obvious in light of the prior_art did not provide defense to claim of literal infringement and ( 2 ) district_court did not abuse its discretion by determining that holder had demonstrated a reasonable_likelihood of success on merits sufficient to warrant injunctive relief

Opinion
GAJARSA Circuit_Judge
The Defendant-Appellant Interface Architectural Resources Inc. ( `` Interface '' ) seeks review of a final judgment by the United_States_District_Court for the District of Maryland granting a motion by the Plaintiff-Appellees Tate Access Floors Inc. and Tate_Access_Floors_Leasing Inc. ( together `` Tate '' ) to preliminarily enjoin Interface from infringing claims 1-BIG_TOKEN__4_and_8__BIG_TOKEN -10 of United States Patent No._4625,491 ( the `` ¡¬491_patent `` )
Interface contends that the district_court erred by granting the preliminary_injunction because Tate failed to make the requisite showing of a reasonable_likelihood of success on the merits of its infringement claim
Because the district_court did not abuse its discretion in granting the preliminary_injunction we affirm

BACKGROUND
A
The ¡¬491_Patent
Tate owns the ¡¬491_patent which pertains to raised access_flooring_panels
¡¬491_patent col._1,_ll._6-9
Raised access_flooring_panels provide an elevated_floor under which materials such as cables and pipes can be run
Id.at col._1,_ll._15-19
The panels rest on pedestals
They are placed side-by-side to form an elevated_floor
By lifting and removing certain panels one can access the materials underneath the floor
Id.at col._1,_ll._30-32

The panels addressed in the ¡¬491_patent have a laminated top surface
Id.at col._1,_ll._57-63
The transparent laminate protects and covers a decorative top surface
Id
These decorative panels are formed by heat bonding a decorative_top_layer onto a number of layers of underlying kraft paper using resin
Id
The resulting edges of the laminated panels are brittle ; without protection they chip crack and appear aesthetically unpleasing

Prior to the claimed invention the industry employed an add-on trim_strip to protect the edges of the panels and to make them look better
Id.at col._1,_ll._33-36
Such trim was problematic because it increased the cost of panels and tended to crack and become loose and to collect dirt and moisture
Id.at col._1,_ll._42-46
The ¡¬491_patent addresses the problems associated with the edges of the panels without employing an add-on trim_strip

Instead of adding trim the ¡¬491_patent solves the problem of brittle edges by removing the top decorative_layer from the periphery of the panels to form an integral trim edge
Id.at col._1,_l._67 to col._2,_l._4
The two independent claims at issue claims 1_and_8 read as follows : 1
A floor_panel for elevated_floors comprising a rectangular base structure adapted to be supported at its corners and providing a load_surface operable to support loads_thereon a floor covering mounted on said load_surface providing a decorative exposed surface layer on the side thereof opposite said load_surface said floor covering providing an inner_body_portion having an appearance contrasting with the appearance of said decorative_surface_layer said floor covering providing a border along the edges of said panels *1361 along which said decorative_surface_layer is removed to expose said inner_body_portion and thereby provide an integral contrasting border around said decorative_surface_layer
8
A floor_panel comprising a rectangular support structure providing a load_surface operable to support loads_thereon a layered laminated floor covering mounted on said load_surface providing a single visible decorative_layer along the side of said floor covering also providing an inner_layer contrasting with said decorative_layer having a thickness substantially greater than the thickness of the decorative_layer adjacent to said decorative_layer along the side thereof facing said load_surface said floor covering providing a border extending along the edges of said panel along which the decorative_layer is removed to expose said inner_layer
Id.at col._4,_l._67 to col._5,_l._11 and col._5,_l._37 to col._6,_l._11 ( emphasis added )

The specification includes figures depicting an embodiment of the claimed floor_panels
The periphery of the panels has a sloping or beveled portion as well as a flat horizontal_portion
For example Figure 4 of the ¡¬491_patent depicts a panel with edges that appear as follows :

?
B
The Accused Product
Interface 's accused floor_panels have a decorative_top_layer with a beveled edge but no horizontal single-layered portion
An example of the accused panels follows

*1362. ?
Interface contends that its panels fall outside the scope of the asserted claims of the ¡¬491_patent as properly construed by virtue of their simple beveled edges
It argues that the `` border '' limitations of claims 1_and_8 encompass only the horizontal_portion depicted in Figure 4 of the ¡¬491_patent
Because Interface 's panels lack a horizontal_portion formed of a single_layer of material and contain only a beveled edge Interface maintains that its panels do not infringe
Tate contends that panels with beveled edges meet the `` border '' limitations notwithstanding the absence of a horizontal_portion formed of a single_layer of material
