Synopsis
Background : Patent holder brought infringement action against competitor over patents that disclosed diaphragm_mouth_call that hunters used to simulate animal_sounds
Parties consented to final disposition by magistrate judge
The United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of Iowa John A. Jarvey Chief United States Magistrate Judge granted judgment for patent holder after jury verdict in its favor
Competitor appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Lourie Circuit_Judge held that :

term `` engaging '' meant to come into contact with ;

amendment to term `` plate '' to require it to have `` length '' did not narrow scope of claim ;

amendment to term `` plate '' which required plate to be `` differentially spaced '' above membrane was merely tangential to contested element in accused device and thus prosecution_history_estoppel did not apply ;

all limitations rule did not preclude finding that dome in accused device was equivalent to claimed `` plate '' ;

district_court did not abuse its discretion in excluding prior_art device from evidence ; and

competitor was not prejudiced by jury instruction that permitted adverse_inference to be drawn against natural person who later had judgment against him vacated

Opinion
LOURIE Circuit_Judge
Hunter 's Specialties Inc. and David_Forbes ( collectively `` Hunter 's Specialties '' ) appeal from the judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of Iowa of literal_infringement willfulness and inducement of infringement as to U.S._Patent 5,520,567 and infringement under the doctrine of equivalents as to U.S._Patent 5,415,578
Hunter 's Specialties also appeals from the court 's decision denying a motion for a new_trial
Primos Inc. v. Hunter 's Specialties Inc. No
C01-004 ( N.D.Iowa Sept._9,_2004 ) ( `` Final Judgment `` )
Because we affirm the district_court 's claim construction of the term `` engaging '' we also affirm the court 's judgment of literal_infringement of the '567_patent
Because we conclude that the application of the doctrine of equivalents was proper we affirm the court 's judgment of infringement of the '578_patent under the doctrine of equivalents
Because the court did not abuse its discretion in excluding evidence and the court 's adverse-inference jury instruction did not constitute prejudicial_error we affirm the court 's decision denying a new_trial on those issues

BACKGROUND
This appeal involves the '578_patent and its continuation the '567_patent which are assigned to Primos Inc. ( `` Primos '' ) and entitled `` Game Call Apparatus ''
The patents disclose a diaphragm_mouth_call that hunters use to simulate animal_sounds
Figure 1 shown below is an embodiment of the invention :

?
As depicted in that figure the diaphragm_mouth_call 10 consists of a frame 18 a membrane 22 that vibrates to produce sound a flexible peripheral edge 12 *844 and a shelf or plate 15 extending above the membrane
The diaphragm_mouth_call is placed completely within the user 's mouth with the free-end of the membrane positioned near the opening of the mouth
'578_patent col._2,_ll._62-64
The user holds the diaphragm in place with his or her tongue while forcing air to travel through a gap between the tongue and the membrane
The air causes the membrane to vibrate and to emit a sound that replicates a particular animal
Id.at col._1,_ll._31-38
The sound produced by the call is affected by the tongue pressure applied to the membrane and the distance between the membrane and the roof of the mouth
Id.at col._1,_ll._38-40
The patented diaphragm_mouth_call claims an improvement over prior mouth call devices in that the shelf or plate provides a constant distance above the membrane and resists upward pressure by the tongue
Id.at col._2,_ll._15-26

Relevant to this appeal are claim 2 of the '578_patent and claim 21 of the '567_patent
Claim 2 of the '578_patent reads as follows : A game call apparatus to be completely inserted inside a person 's mouth for calling game comprising : a frame ; a membrane of material stretched over the frame ; a flexible and moldable peripheral edge extending outwardly from the frame ; and
a plate having a length the plate extending generally upward from the frame and over a portion of the membrane the plate being differentially spaced above the portion of the membrane at various locations along the length of the plate
'578_patent col._4,_ll._45-55 ( emphases added )
Claim 21 of the '567_patent reads as follows : A game call for use inside a person 's mouth comprising : a U-shaped_frame ; a yieldable reed spanning across the U-shaped_frame ; a first roof-of-mouth engaging yieldable sealing portion carried by the frame ; a second roof-of-mouth engaging portion extending upwardly from the frame the second portion being spaced away from the first portion the first and second portions defining a predetermined orientation of the U-shaped_frame insider the mouth relative to the roof of mouth
'567_patent col._6,_ll._20-32 ( emphases added )

On January 24 2001 Primos filed suit against its competitor Hunter 's Specialties alleging that Hunter 's Specialties 's accused device known as the Tone_Trough infringed Primos 's patents
The accused Tone_Trough is a diaphragm_mouth_call device that among other features contains a dome extending above the membrane instead of a shelf or plate as claimed in Primos 's patents
Primos subsequently amended its complaint alleging that individual defendant David_Forbes induced infringement of its patents.1

Primos initially moved for summary_judgment of literal_infringement and for a preliminary injunction against Hunter 's Specialties
Hunter 's Specialties filed several cross-motions including for summary_judgment of noninfringement both literally *845 and under the doctrine of equivalents
On July_24,_2002 the court denied all the motions filed by both parties
In its decision the court construed the term `` plate '' in claim 2 of the '578_patent to mean `` a structural element of relatively uniform thickness and flatness which may also have some moderate curvature to it ''
Primos v. Hunter 's Specialties No
C01-004 MJM ( N.D.Iowa July_24,_2002 ) ( `` Summary Judgment Order `` )
Relying on that construction of the term `` plate '' the court found that `` reasonable minds could differ as to the presence or absence of a 'plate ' in the Tone_Trough '' and thus denied all summary_judgment_motions relating to infringement of the '578_patent
Id
Regarding claim 21 of the '567_patent the court noted that while the term `` second-roof-of-mouth engaging portion '' is not in dispute it stated that `` it is clear that this language requires that a portion of the claimed device.. come into contact with the roof of the user 's mouth while in use ''
Id. slip op.at 43
The court then determined that there were genuine issues of material fact relating to whether the Tone_Trough_device operates when touching the roof of a user 's mouth and therefore denied the summary_judgment_motions relating to infringement of the '567_patent

Hunter 's Specialties then requested a Markman hearing to interpret the term `` engaging '' in claim 21 of the '567_patent
On March_15,_2004 the court construed that term to mean to `` come into contact with ''
Primos v. Hunter 's Specialties No
C01-004 2004_WL_3323188_(N.D.Iowa_Mar._15,_2004) ( `` Claim Construction Order `` )
The court rejected Hunter 's Specialties ' construction of the term `` engaging '' as `` interlocking '' noting that while the word `` interlocking '' as defined in a standard dictionary may be appropriate in the context of a transmission or a latch it is not appropriate in the context of the roof of one 's mouth
The court also observed that the specification of the '567_patent did not support a construction of `` engaging '' to mean `` interlocking '' because the figures in the patent did not provide any means with which the diaphragm_mouth_call could interlock in the roof of a mouth
According to the court it had previously interpreted `` engaging '' to mean `` to come into contact with '' and it saw no reason to modify that construction

Hunter 's Specialties again moved for summary_judgment asserting that prosecution_history_estoppel barred the application of the doctrine of equivalents as to the '578_patent in light of our intervening decision in Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co. Ltd. 344_F.3d_1359_(Fed.Cir.2003)
The court determined that the term `` plate '' was amended during prosecution by describing it as `` having a length '' but that that amendment did not narrow the scope of the claim because `` all physical objects have a length ''
Primos v. Hunter 's Specialties No
C01-004 MJM ( N.D.Iowa_Mar._12,_2004 ) ( `` Prosecution History Estoppel Order `` )
The court also observed that the term `` plate '' was amended to require that it be `` differentially spaced '' above the membrane which narrowed the scope of the claim
Id
According to the court the subject matter surrendered by that amendment involved `` objects that are not differentially spaced above the membrane ''
Because the Tone_Trough contained a dome that was spaced above the membrane and therefore arguably did not fall within that surrendered area the court denied summary_judgment of no infringement under the doctrine of equivalents as to the '578_patent

Finally before trial Primos filed a motion requesting that a device known as the Aluminum_Flap_Call not be introduced as evidence during trial
The court granted that motion and noted in its order that *846 throughout discovery Hunter 's Specialties never identified the Aluminum_Flap_Call as invalidating prior_art
Primos v. Hunter 's Specialties No
C01-004 MJM ( N.D.Iowa_Mar._12,_2004 ) ( `` Aluminum_Flap_Call Order `` )
Hunter 's Specialties had sought to introduce the Aluminum_Flap_Call_device when it claimed it had found the device which was approximately three months prior to trial and several months after discovery had closed
However Hunter 's Specialties failed to offer any explanation why it could not locate the Aluminum_Flap_Call during discovery
In light of those circumstances the court determined that allowing the Aluminum_Flap_Call to be introduced as evidence during trial would result in unfair surprise to Primos and thus the court granted Primos 's motion to exclude the Aluminum_Flap_Call as evidence

A jury trial commenced on March_15,_2004
In the jury instructions concerning inducement of infringement against individual defendants Wayne_Carlton and David_Forbes the court instructed the jury that it could consider several factors and stated that `` the assertion of the attorney-client_privilege with respect to a non-infringement opinion may support an inference that the withheld advice of counsel was adverse to that party ''
As for willful infringement against Hunter 's Specialties the court did not instruct the jury as to an adverse_inference but rather stated that the jury must consider the `` totality of the circumstances ''
After a three-and-a-half week trial the jury found that Hunter 's Specialties ' Tone_Trough_device literally infringed the '567_patent and infringed the '578_patent under the doctrine of equivalents
The jury also found that Hunter 's Specialties willfully infringed the '567_patent and that David_Forbes and Wayne_Carlton induced infringement of that patent

Hunter 's Specialties and Wayne_Carlton moved for judgment as a matter of law ( `` JMOL '' ) arguing that the court improperly construed the term `` engaging '' in claim 21 of the '567_patent and that the `` all limitations rule '' and prosecution_history_estoppel barred the application of the doctrine of equivalents as to the '578_patent
Those defendants also moved for a new_trial arguing that the court erred in excluding the Aluminum_Flap_Call as evidence and that the court 's adverse-inference instruction resulted in prejudicial_error
The court denied the motion for JMOL and the motion for a new_trial
Primos v. Hunter 's Specialties No
C01-004 ( N.D.Iowa Mar._31,_2005 )
( `` Post-Trial Order `` )
In its decision the court first reaffirmed its construction of the claim term `` engaging '' in claim 21 of the '567_patent noting that it had addressed the same issue in previous decisions
The court next determined that the `` all limitations rule '' did not preclude the application of the doctrine of equivalents for the '578_patent reasoning that the only disputed term was `` plate '' in claim 2 and that determining that a dome was equivalent to a plate did not vitiate that claim limitation
The court also held that prosecution_history_estoppel did not prevent the application of the doctrine of equivalents as to the '578_patent because the Tone_Trough did not fall within the area surrendered during prosecution
In addition the court denied Hunter 's Specialties 's motion for a new_trial reaffirming its prior decision that the Aluminum_Flap_Call_device could not be introduced as invalidating prior_art because it was produced after the period for discovery had closed
Although the court determined that its `` adverse_inference '' instruction to the jury was not in error the court later vacated judgment against Wayne_Carlton the only defendant who had asserted the attorney-client_privilege in light of our decision in Knorr- *847 Bremse Systeme Fuer Nutzfahrzeuge GMBH v. Dana Corp. 383_F.3d_1337_(Fed.Cir.2004) ( en banc )

Hunter 's Specialties timely appealed to this court and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
