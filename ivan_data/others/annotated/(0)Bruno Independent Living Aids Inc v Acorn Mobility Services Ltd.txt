We affirm

BACKGROUND
Bruno manufactures and sells `` stairlifts '' which are devices that allow persons with mobility impairments to ascend and descend stairways on a chair that travels along a rail
In November 1991 Bruno filed a patent application at the United_States_Patent and Trademark Office ( `` PTO '' ) directed to a stairlift which issued as the '405_patent in July 1993

In July 2002 Bruno sued Acorn a competitor alleging infringement of claims 5 9 10 and 15 of the '405_patent
During discovery Acorn produced numerous disclosures of prior_art stairlifts that had not been considered by the patent examiner and thereafter moved for summary judgment of noninfringement and invalidity
Admitting that the asserted claims were invalid in view of the prior_art identified by Acorn Bruno filed a reissue application at the PTO the fate of which is immaterial to this appeal
In due course the district_court granted Acorn 's motion for summary judgment,1 declaring claims 5 9 10 and 15 invalid
Bruno_Indep
Living_Aids Inc. v. Acorn Mobility Servs. Ltd. 286_F.Supp.2d_1020_(W.D.Wis.2003)

Subsequently Acorn accused Bruno of having intentionally withheld invalidating prior_art from the PTO and asked the district_court to declare the case `` exceptional '' for the purpose of awarding attorney_fees under ¡± 285.2 Acorn also requested additional_discovery to the extent the district_court required further evidence to justify a fee_award
Upon briefing by both parties the district_court declared the case exceptional after determining that Bruno had engaged in inequitable_conduct while prosecuting the '405_patent and consequently denied Acorn 's motion for additional_discovery

As the ground for its inequitable_conduct determination the district_court found that Bruno had failed to disclose to the PTO information on several invalidating prior_art stairlifts that Bruno had submitted to the Food and Drug Administration ( `` FDA '' ) in seeking approval to sell a stairlift covered by the '405_patent
Observing that the disclosure to the FDA occurred concurrently with the prosecution of the '405_patent the district_court-noting the absence of a credible good faith explanation from Bruno for not disclosing *1351 the same information to the PTO-inferred that the information had been withheld with deceptive intent
The district_court thereupon concluded that Bruno had engaged in inequitable_conduct which it deemed sufficient to render the case exceptional for the purpose of imposing a fee_award under ¡± 285
Final judgment was entered in November 2003 in which Bruno was ordered to pay Acorn $ 399,459.32 in attorney_fees

Living_Aids Inc. v. Acorn Mobility Servs. Ltd. No._02- C-0391-C 2003_WL_23095743_(W.D.Wis._Nov._6,_2003)

On appeal Bruno challenges the district_court 's determination of an exceptional_case
In response Acorn conditionally cross-appeals from the ruling denying additional_discovery on that issue
We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
