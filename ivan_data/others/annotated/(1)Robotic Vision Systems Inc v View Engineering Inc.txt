DECISION
View_Engineering Inc. ( `` View '' ) appeals the July_1,_1998 decision of the United_States_District_Court for the Central_District of California Docket 96-CV-2288 finding that View had infringed U.S. Patent No._5465,152 ( `` the '152_patent `` ) issued to the Robotic_Vision_Systems Inc. ( `` RVSI '' ) and holding the patent to be not invalid for obviousness under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103
Because the trial court did not err in its determinations we affirm

BACKGROUND
Robotic_Vision_Systems Inc. ( `` RVSI '' ) manufactures and sells machines to perform inspections of integrated circuit_devices
Until June 1998 View_Engineering Inc. ( `` View '' ) also manufactured and sold inspection equipment in particular its Model 880 inspection_machine
Although RVSI and View do not manufacture chips themselves they sell equipment for use by device_manufacturers

United States Patent No._5465,152 issued to RVSI on November 7 1995
The patent is directed to a `` Method for Coplanarity Inspection of Package or Substrate Warpage for Ball Grid Arrays Column Arrays and Similar Structures ''
Ball grid arrays ( `` BGAs '' ) are integrated circuit_devices that have an array of solder_balls on one face
Each ball sits on a metal pad known as a `` signal pad '' which in turn sits on a `` substrate '' and connects the ball to the internal integrated circuitry
`` Coplanarity '' refers to the degree to which a set of points are in the same plane i.e. how `` flat '' something is
At the time of the invention ball-top coplanarity measurements1 were known in the prior *1372 art because it is important for device_manufacturers to know the coplanarity of the solder_balls to make sure that the BGA devices will mate properly with other devices

The '152_patent discloses a method for using incident_laser_radiation to measure the coplanarity of a substrate
The measurements are not done on the substrate directly or on the ball-tops but are done by using `` index_pads '' on the substrate as targets to perform the measurements.2 According to the written description these index_pads can be separately manufactured pads used only to measure substrate coplanarity or the index_pads can be selected from signal_pads that may or may not eventually be used as BGA sites
The only independent claim in the '152_patent is claim 1 which reads as follows :

1
A method for determining coplanarity of substrates for ball grid array column grid array and similar surface mount integrated circuit chips using 3-D optical_sensing_means comprising the steps of : [ 1 ] providing opaque fiducials as index_pads
[ 2 ] where the heights of said index_pads are correlated with signal pad heights in a neighborhood about said index_pads ; [ 3 ] said index_pads being opaque to incident radiation from said 3-D optical_sensing_means ; [ 4 ] reflecting by said index_pads sufficient radiation allow height measurement by said 3-D optical_sensing_means ; [ 5 ] disposing said index_pads in a prearranged pattern over a domain of array signal_pads ; [ 6 ] restricting said index_pads to a predetermined range of heights ; [ 7 ] measuring the heights of each of at least three said index_pads at said index pad coordinate locations ; [ 8 ] suitably fitting a preselected surface_shape to the index pad height and coordinate location data ; [ 9 ] and calculating the difference in height between each index pad and the preselected surface_shape evaluated at the index pad location
( paragraphing and emphasis added )
Dependent claims 3_and_12 are also at issue
They read as follows : 3
A method as defined in claim 1 wherein said index_pads are metallic and opaque
12
A method as described in claim 1 in which the index_pads are identical with the signal_pads rather than separately fabricated elements intended solely for use as fiducial pads which index_pads are located at signal pad sites occupied by array elements such as bga balls columns or other ; and determining coplanarity prior to deposition of grid array elements
The written description of the '152_patent discloses three examples as preferred embodiments of the claimed method : There must be a close correlation between the heights of the index_pads and the signal_pads since the objective of having the index_pads is to provide a means of inferring the heights of the signal_pads
This can be accomplished by properly designing the fabrication process
One means of accomplishing this is to use unused signal_pads as index_pads
A second means is to construct index_pads by plating additional material on existing signal_pads using photoresist masking techniques to avoid plating signal_pads which are not dedicated to indexing
...
There are innumerable ways of creating and disposing the index_pads over the substrate only several of which will be detailed here
However other embodiments which generally follow the *1373 concepts outlined here are considered to be covered by this disclosure
Three approaches serve to illustrate the method
In the first two cases the index_pads are selected from the totality of pad on the substrate
In third case the index_pads are fabricated separately from the signal_pads
In case one the index_pads are selected from the total number of available pads and dedicated for measurement_purposes
That is they are empty signal_pads
They are distributed over the substrate surface so that their height provides a measure of the variations in signal pad coplanarity
'152_Patent col._5,_ll._30-57 ( emphasis added )
Therefore the written description discloses the use of signal_pads as index_pads and index_pads that are separately fabricated
RVSI filed suit against View alleging that View infringed the method claims of the '152_patent through the View_Model 880 inspection_machine
The 880 machine measures BGA coplanarity by using bare signal_pads as laser targets
View moved for summary_judgment of noninfringement arguing that properly interpreted the claim required the manufacture or fabrication of the index_pads along with their measurement
The court on summary_judgment rejected this argument and held that the language of claim 1 - specifically the terms `` providing '' `` correlating '' `` disposing '' and `` restricting '' - did not require separate manufacture of the index_pads and encompassed the selection of pre-existing signal_pads as index_pads for measurement_purposes
A bench trial followed ; the court reiterated its summary_judgment claim construction and found the View_Model 880 accused device to infringe claims 1 3 and 12

In its opinion the court stated that : Properly interpreted the '152_patent requires that index_pads disposed in a particular arrangement be provided for measurement and that the heights of these index_pads should be correlated with that of signal_pads and restricted to a specific range of heights
The selection of index_pads for measurement can satisfy these requirements
Claim 12 requires identical signal and index_pads ; Claim 1 permits either separate index_pads and signal_pads or identical signal_pads/index_pads
Slip op.at 8

The court based this interpretation on the claim language and on the examples disclosed in the written description which described embodiments of the claimed method using both separately manufactured index_pads and index_pads that were chosen from pre-existing signal_pads
Based on this interpretation the court found the Model 880 device to infringe the '152_patent

The court also addressed View 's obviousness defense which it rejected
The court found that one of ordinary_skill in the art would be either : ( 1 ) a person with a B.S
degree in engineering mathematics or a technical discipline ; ( 2 ) an applications engineer ; or ( 3 ) a person with knowledge based on experience equivalent to ( 1 ) or ( 2 )
The court further found that the date of the invention was no later than January 31 1994
Based on its factual findings including those concerning objective evidence of nonobviousness the court held that the invention of the '152_patent would not have been obvious to one of ordinary_skill in the art
View now appeals the court 's finding of infringement and its holding of non-obviousness
