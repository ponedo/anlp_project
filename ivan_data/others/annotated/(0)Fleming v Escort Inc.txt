United States Court of Appeals Federal Circuit
Hoyt A. FLEMING Plaintiff-Appellant v. ESCORT INC. and Beltronics_USA Inc. Defendants-Cross-Appellants
Nos._2014-1331 2014-1371
| Dec._24,_2014
Synopsis
Background : Following jury_verdict of infringement and invalidity in part of reissue_patents related to radar_detectors for detecting police_signals parties filed cross-motions for judgment as a matter of law on invalidity_determinations
The United States District Court for the District of Idaho B. Lynn Winmill Chief Judge 2014_WL_713532 denied motions
Cross-appeals were taken

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Taranto Circuit_Judge held that :

substantial evidence supported determinations that claims in patents related to radar_detectors for detecting police_signals were invalid ;

inventor 's testimony of prior_invention was sufficiently corroborated ; and

patentee established error prerequisite for reissue_patents

Affirmed

Before TARANTO BRYSON and HUGHES Circuit_Judges
Opinion
TARANTO Circuit_Judge
The district_court in this case refused to disturb a jury_verdict concerning two reissue_patents
The jury found for the patentee on infringement and validity as to most of the asserted claims but it invalidated five claims
The patentee Hoyt_Fleming appeals the five invalidity_determinations arguing that ( 1 ) the testimony offered to establish invalidity was insufficiently specific to support the verdict ; ( 2 ) there was insufficient corroboration of the prior_invention relied on for the invalidity_determinations ; and ( 3 ) the prior_invention if it existed was abandoned suppressed or concealed disqualifying it from invalidating the claims
The adjudicated infringers Escort Inc. and Beltronics_USA Inc. ( collectively Escort ) cross-appeal on the ground that all of the asserted claims are invalid because Fleming 's reason for seeking reissue did not meet the `` error '' precondition for obtaining reissue
We affirm

BACKGROUND
Hoyt_Fleming owns two reissue_patents-U.S. Patent Nos
RE39,038 ( issued Mar._28,_2006 ) and RE40,653 ( issued Mar._10,_2009 ) -issued under 35 U.S.C.¡± 251
Both relate to radar_detectors for detecting police_signals
They claim methods for incorporating as well as apparatuses that *1374 incorporate a Global Positioning Satellite ( GPS ) unit into a radar_detector
The incorporated GPS can reduce false alarms ( i.e. the signaling of a police_presence when none exists ) by allowing the detector to disregard or `` lock out '' certain signals from an identified location known to produce such false alarms ( e.g. a storefront door opener transmitting a radar signal that can be mistaken for a police_presence )

Claim 1 of the ¡¬038_patent is representative of the method claims
It reads : 1
A method executed by a device having a position of generating an alert to an incoming_radar_signal having a frequency and a signal strength the method comprising the acts of : ( a ) detecting the incoming_radar_signal ; ( b ) determining the position of the device that detected the incoming_radar_signal ; and
( c ) generating an alert if the position of the device is not within a predetermined distance of a predetermined position
¡¬038_patent col. 6 lines 49-58

Claim 18 of the ¡¬038_patent is representative of the apparatus claims
It reads : 18
A radar_detector for alerting an operator of a motor vehicle to an incoming police radar signal comprising : ( a ) a microprocessor ; ( b ) a circuit coupled to the microprocessor for detecting the incoming police radar signal ; and
( c ) a global positioning system receiver coupled to the microprocessor and operable to provide the microprocessor with data that indicates the position of the radar_detector
¡¬038_patent col. 7 lines 53-61

On March_10,_2009 Fleming sued Escort for infringement of his two patents
At the heart of Escort 's defenses was the contention that Steven Orr who works for Escort as a consultant had invented a GPS-incorporating radar_detector before Fleming did-a prior_invention Escort invoked to support anticipation and obviousness challenges under 35 U.S.C.¡±¡± 102 ( g ) and 103 ( 2006 )1 Fleming 's claimed priority date is April_14,_1999 -the filing date of his original patent application
Orr alleged that he conceived his invention in 1988 and made a working embodiment that reduced it to practice in April 1996
From 1988_to_1996 Orr was working at Cincinnati_Microwave which owned the potential_patent_rights to the alleged invention at issue
Cincinnati_Microwave entered bankruptcy on February 14 1997
With Orr assisting in the bankruptcy process Escort acquired Cincinnati_Microwave 's assets including the potential_patent_rights to the alleged Orr_invention during the summer of 1997
Escort sought Orr 's assistance in the new enterprise and Orr began working at Escort in July 1998
He filed a patent application to claim his alleged invention with Escort as assignee on June_14,_1999 two months after Fleming filed his application

The jury in this case found most of Fleming 's asserted claims to be infringed by Escort and not to be invalid
It found invalidity however as to five claims of the ¡¬038_patent -claims 1 18 45 47 and 48
The jury invalidated claim 45 as anticipated *1375 by Orr 's prior_invention
It invalidated claim 18 as anticipated by the Orr_invention and also for obviousness in light of Orr 's invention and two prior-art_patents Hoffberg ( U.S._Patent_No._6252,544 ) and Ross ( U.S._Patent_No._5977,884 )
And it invalidated claims 1 47 and 48 for obviousness in light of Orr 's prior_invention and two prior-art_patents Hoffberg and Valentine ( U.S._Patent_No._5146,226 )

Fleming subsequently sought judgment as a matter of law to reverse the jury 's five invalidity_determinations
He argued that the testimony regarding invalidity was conclusory that Orr 's testimony regarding his prior_invention was insufficiently corroborated and that Orr 's prior_invention-even if it existed-had been abandoned suppressed or concealed within the meaning of 35 U.S.C.¡± 102 ( g ) ( 2 ) disqualifying it as a basis for invalidity
Escort in turn sought judgment that Fleming 's patents were invalid arguing that Fleming had not identified an `` error '' in his original patent ( U.S._Patent_No._6204,798 ) a prerequisite to securing a reissue patent under section 251
The district_court denied both sides ' motions

Both parties appeal the district_court 's decision
We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
