Before Reyna Bryson and Stoll Circuit_Judges
Opinion
Reyna Circuit_Judge
*1016 Plaintiffs-Appellants Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. Teva_Pharmaceutical_Industries Ltd. Teva_Neuroscience Inc. and Yeda_Research and Development_Co. Ltd. appeal the decision of the United_States_District_Court for the District of Delaware invalidating all asserted_claims of patents directed to COPAXONETHE_R_40mg/mL a product marketed for treatment of patients with relapsing forms of multiple_sclerosis
Because the district_court correctly held the asserted_claims invalid as obvious under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103 we affirm.1

BACKGROUND
I
Patents at Issue
Yeda_Research & Development_Co. Ltd. is the assignee of U.S. Patent Nos._8232,250 8,399,413 8,969,302 and 9,155,776 ( the '250 '413 '302 and '776_patent respectively ) all entitled `` Low Frequency Glatiramer Acetate Therapy ''
The patents collectively referred to as the `` Copaxone_patents '' share a common specification and claim priority to the same two provisional applications
J.A
57-69
The earliest priority date of the Copaxone_patents is August 20 2009
J.A
23

*1017 The Copaxone_patents describe and claim COPAXONETHE_R_40mg/mL a treatment for relapsing-remitting multiple_sclerosis ( `` RRMS '' )
RRMS is a form of multiple_sclerosis an autoimmune disorder that causes the body 's immune system to attack the central nervous system
RRMS is characterized by unpredictable relapses followed by periods of remission with no new signs of disease activity

The active ingredient in COPAXONETHE_R_40mg/mL is glatiramer acetate ( `` GA '' ) a synthetic mixture of polypeptides
GA is also known as `` copolymer 1 '' or `` Cop
1 ''
COPAXONETHE_R_40mg/mL is supplied as a single-dose prefilled syringe
Broadly the treatment consists of the injection of 40mg of GA three times a week abbreviated `` 40mg_GA_3x/week ''
Relevant to this appeal side_effects of GA injections include injection-site reactions ( `` ISRs '' ) and immediate post-injection reactions ( `` IPIRs '' )
ISRs are physical symptoms at the injection site such as swelling or itchiness
IPIRs are reactions immediately following an injection such as flushes sweating or palpitations

Prior to COPAXONETHE_R_40mg/mL in 1996 the Food and Drug Administration ( `` FDA '' ) approved COPAXONETHE_R 20mg/mL a regimen consisting of the daily injection of 20mg GA. Daily GA injections were known to subject patients to discomfort including side_effects in the form of ISRs and IPIRs
J.A
20692

For analyzing the obviousness of the Copaxone_patents in this case a key limitation of the asserted_claims is the administration of a 40mg GA dose in three subcutaneous_injections over seven days
Claim 1 of the '250_patent is representative : 1
A method of alleviating a symptom of relapsing-remitting multiple_sclerosis in a human_patient_suffering from relapsing-remitting multiple_sclerosis or a patient who has experienced a first clinical episode and is determined to be at high risk of developing clinically definite multiple_sclerosis comprising administering to the human_patient a therapeutically effective regimen of three subcutaneous_injections of a 40 mg dose of glatiramer acetate over a period of seven days with at least one day between every subcutaneous_injection the regimen being sufficient to alleviate the symptom of the patient
'250_patent col. 16_ll._35 -45

Apart from claim 1 of the '302_patent2 all asserted in-dependent claims require at least one day between doses
'250_patent col. 16_ll._35 -45 col. 17_l._25 -col. 18_l._6 ; '413_patent col. 16_ll._26 -36 col. 18_ll._14 -28 ; '302_patent col. 17_ll._4 -12 ; '776_patent col. 16_ll._35 -50 col. 16_l._61 -col. 17_l._19 col. 17_ll._37 -54 col. 17_l._65 -col. 18_l._22
Certain dependent claims of the '250 '413 and '776_patent s further require improved tolerability and/or reduced frequency of injection reactions in the claimed regimen as compared to a 20mg GA daily regimen
See e.g. '250_patent col. 17_ll._21 -24 col. 18_ll._7 -15 ; '413_patent col. 16_ll._51 -54 ; '776_patent col. 16_ll._51 -54 col 17_l._65 -col. 18_l._25

The '776_patent contains additional limitations namely the requirement that the 40mg_GA_3x/week regimen `` reduce [ ] severity of injection_site_reactions '' compared to a 20mg daily regimen as seen in claim 1 : *1018 1
A method of treating a human_patient_suffering from a relapsing form of multiple_sclerosis while inducing reduced_severity of injection_site_reactions in the human_patient relative to administration of 20 mg of glatiramer acetate s.c. daily the method consisting of one subcutaneous_injection of 1 ml of a pharmaceutical_composition comprising 40 mg of glatiramer acetate on only each of three days during each week of treatment with at least one day without a subcutaneous_injection of the pharmaceutical_composition between each day on which there is a subcutaneous_injection wherein the pharmaceutical_composition is in a prefilled syringe and wherein the pharmaceutical_composition further comprises mannitol and has a pH in the range 5.BIG_TOKEN__5_to_7__BIG_TOKEN0 so as to thereby treat the human_patient with reduced_severity of injection_site_reactions relative to administration of 20 mg of glatiramer acetate s.c. daily
