Opinion
BRYSON Circuit_Judge
Springs Window Fashions L.P. Shade-O-Matic_Ltd. and Manor_Tec Inc. ( collectively `` Springs '' ) appeal from an order of the United_States_District_Court for the Western_District of Wisconsin granting the motion of Novo Industries L.P. for summary_judgment of noninfringement of United States Patent No._6178,857 ( `` the ¡¬857_patent `` )
Novo cross-appeals the grant of summary_judgment dismissing its counterclaims of tortious_interference and disparagement based on bad faith enforcement of the ¡¬857_patent
We affirm the summary_judgment as to both the claim of infringement and the counterclaims of tortious_interference and disparagement

I
The ¡¬857_patent which was assigned to Shade-O-Matic and then licensed to *992 Springs Window Fashions relates to a method of trimming window_blinds
Because windows vary in size there is a benefit to being able to customize the window_blinds
While a retail_store could order custom-sized blinds from a factory another approach is for the retail_store to order stock_sizes of blinds and cut them to the appropriate size at the time of purchase
Manufacturers such as Springs provide retail_stores with both the stock_sizes of blinds and `` cut-down '' machines that can trim the head_rail slats and bottom_rail of window_blinds
The ¡¬857_patent recites a method used in connection with such a cut-down machine

Independent claim 1 of the ¡¬857_patent is the only independent claim
It provides : 1
A method of trimming the width of venetian blinds of the type having a head_rail a plurality of slats and a bottom_rail each of said head_rail said slats and said bottom_rail having first and second opposed ends said method comprising the steps of : placing a first_end of said head_rail of said venetian blind through a corresponding head_rail opening in a support_body and placing a first_end of said bottom_rail and a first_end of said slats through respective openings in said support_body whereby respective first_ends of said head_rails said bottom_rail and said slats extend through said openings ; moving said first_ends of said head_rails said bottom_rail and said blind slats through said openings in said support_body and into respective aligned further openings in a cutting means said cutting means including a first cutter for cutting said head_rail and a separate_second_cutter for cutting at least said slats ; and moving said first and second cutters to cut at least said head_rail and said slats
¡¬857_patent col._12,_l._66 to col._13,_l._18 ( emphasis added )
One of the embodiments illustrated in the specification uses a die plate that slides diagonally to cut the head_rail and a blade mounting frame that moves horizontally to cut the slats
See ¡¬857_patent figures 1-7

On July_16,_2001 Springs filed suit charging Novo with infringing claims 1 2 8 and 10 of the ¡¬857_patent through the manufacture and sale of cut-down machines that employ the claimed methods
In Novo 's accused device a single plate with multiple blades cuts the head_rail bottom_rail and slats
The plate has a series of openings for the rails and slats and it has blades that correspond to the openings
When the plate is moved the blades cut the rails and slats
Novo moved for summary_judgment arguing that its device did not employ `` separate '' cutters within the meaning of the asserted claims

The district_court granted Novo 's motion
The court construed the term `` separate '' to mean capable of independent_movement
The court rejected Springs 's contention that `` separate '' means simply different cutting surfaces
Springs 's construction according to the district_court would render the term `` separate '' superfluous in the phrase `` separate_second_cutter '' in light of the presence of the word `` second ''
Instead the court looked to dictionary definitions of the term `` separate '' including `` detached disconnected or disjoined '' to conclude that the cutters must `` have the potential for independent_movement ''
The court further held that the specification and prosecution history of the ¡¬857_patent confirmed that the inventor intended to limit the claimed invention *993 to detached and independently moveable cutters

In light of that claim_construction the district_court held that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether Novo 's machines infringed because Novo 's device did not have two cutters that were moveable independently of one another
Instead the blades in the Novo machine were all attached to the same plate and when that plate moved so did all the blades
