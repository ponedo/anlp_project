| Decided : October 26 2017
Synopsis
Background : Owner of patents directed to a process for preparing a stable_formulation of ertapenem an antibiotic_compound brought infringement action against competitor

Patent owner appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Lourie Circuit_Judge held that :

claimed process would have been obvious at the time invention was made and

secondary considerations did not overcome finding of obviousness

Affirmed

Merck_Sharp & Dohme_Corp. ( `` Merck '' ) appeals from the decision of the United_States_District_Court for the District of Delaware concluding after a bench_trial that claims 21-34 ( `` the asserted claims '' ) of U.S._Patent 6,486,150 ( `` the '150_patent `` ) are invalid under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103 ( 2006 )

Because the district_court did not err in its conclusion of obviousness we affirm

BACKGROUND
Merck owns the '150_patent which is directed to a process for preparing a stable_formulation of ertapenem an antibiotic_compound shown below : ?
Ertapenem is known to be unstable because of two degradation reactions-hydrolysis of the lactam nitrogen ( highlighted by a red circle ) and dimerization via the pyrrolidine_nitrogen ( highlighted by a blue square )

The prior_art taught that ertapenem can be stabilized from dimerization by reacting the pyrrolidine_nitrogen with carbon dioxide to form a `` carbon_dioxide_adduct ''
The method of the '150_patent claims a manufacturing process for a final_formulation of the antibiotic that purportedly minimizes both dimerization and hydrolysis degradation pathways
See Appellant 's Br
12-14
Claim 21 is representative and reads as follows : 21
A process for preparing a final_formulation_product of a compound of formula Ia *727

?
or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt or hydrates wherein R4 R5 and R6 are independently : ( a ) hydrogen
( b ) ( C1-C6 ) -alkyl or
( c ) alkali-metal or alkali_earth-metal wherein the alkali-metal or alkali_earth-metal is sodium potassium lithium cesium rubidium barium calcium or magnesium ; comprising the steps of : ( 1 ) charging a solution of carbon_dioxide_source having a pH_range of about 6.0 to about 12.0 into a reaction_vessel ; ( 2 ) adding an effective amount of a mole ratio of a base and an active ingredient into the reaction_vessel containing the solution of carbon_dioxide_source to maintain pH at about 6.0 to about 9.0 and a temperature_range of about -3¢X_C. to about 15¢X_C. ; [ and ] ( 3 ) lyophilizing the solution of Step ( 2 ) to yield the final_formulation_product of a compound of formula Ia with less than about 10 % of moisture content
'150_patent col. 18_ll._11 -43

On May_29,_2014 Hospira Inc. ( `` Hospira '' ) notified Merck that it had filed an abbreviated new drug application ( `` ANDA '' ) seeking approval to engage in the commercial manufacture use or sale of generic versions of Merck 's InvanzTHE_R product the principal component of which is the carbon_dioxide_adduct of ertapenem
In response Merck sued Hospira for infringement of two patents-the '150_patent and U.S._Patent 5,952,323 ( `` the '323_patent `` )
The district_court concluded that the asserted claims of the '323_patent were not invalid and were infringed and that the asserted claims of the '150_patent would also be infringed but were invalid as obvious over the '323_patent and PCT publication WO 98/18800 ( `` Almarsson '' )
See Decision 2016_WL_5872620 at *11 *16 *21

The district_court found that while none of the three steps of claim 21 of the '150_patent was individually taught by the prior_art the `` recipe '' for the final_formulation was disclosed and the three steps leading to that formulation were nothing more than conventional manufacturing steps that would have been obvious from the disclosures and thus were the product of routine_experimentation
Id.at *17-20
The court found that both references expressly taught that the formation of the carbon_dioxide_adduct is pH-dependent and requires a pH_range of about 6.0 to about 9.0 ; sodium hydroxide could be used to adjust the pH ; and the carbon_dioxide_adduct could be produced using `` standard lyophilization techniques ''
Id.at *16-17
The court also found that while the claimed temperature_range was not explicitly taught in the prior_art it was understood that degradation is minimized at low temperatures so one of ordinary skill would have wanted to keep the temperature as low as possible without freezing
Id.at *18

*728 Regarding the dependent_claims the district_court noted that Merck `` focused entirely on the validity of claim 21 '' and thus provided no evidence rebutting Hospira 's expert 's testimony that each of the dependent_claims ' narrower limitations was either expressly disclosed by the references or would have been obvious from routine_experimentation
Id.at *21

The district_court reviewed Merck 's objective_evidence and concluded that commercial_success and copying by others were shown but that the objective_evidence could not overcome the `` strong prima facie case of obviousness '' established by Hospira
Id
The court found that while there was commercial_success tied to the asserted claims the evidence was `` weak [ ened ] '' by the `` blocking effect '' of U.S._Patent 5,478,820 ( `` the '820_patent `` ) -directed to ertapenem itself-of which Merck was the exclusive licensee
The court explained that no other entity aside from Zeneca the original patentee and Merck would have had any incentive to develop a formulation of ertapenem for fear of infringing the '820_patent
Id.at *9

The district_court also found copying by others because Hospira tried five alternative formulations in an attempt to avoid copying the '150_patent but ultimately it had to rely on the accused process which the court found would infringe the '150_patent
Id.at *10
However while the court found that Hospira 's `` decision to copy [ Merck 's ] formulation and process 'is an indicium of nonobviousness ' `` it concluded that the evidence could not overcome the strong showing of obviousness presented by Hospira based on the prior_art

Merck timely appealed to this court
