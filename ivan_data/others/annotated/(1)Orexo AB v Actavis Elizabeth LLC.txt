United States Court of Appeals Federal Circuit
OREXO AB Orexo_US_Inc. Plaintiffs-Appellants v. ACTAVIS ELIZABETH LLC Defendant-Appellee
2017-1333
| Decided : September 10 2018
Synopsis
Background : Patentee brought action against competitor alleging that competitor 's filing of abbreviated new drug application ( ANDA ) seeking to market generic sublingual_tablet infringed patent for method of sublingually administering tablet and patent for sublingual_tablet used for treatment of opioid_dependence
The United_States_District_Court for the District of Delaware No._1 :14-cv-00829-SLR-SRF Sue L. Robinson J. 217_F.Supp.3d_756 granted judgment for competitor in part after finding at bench trial that some claims of one patent were invalid on ground of obviousness
Patentee appealed

The Court of Appeals Newman Circuit_Judge held that prior_art did not suggest selection and combination achieved by inventors in sublingual drug formulation that provided improved treatment of opioid_dependence

Reversed and remanded

Opinion
Newman Circuit_Judge
Orexo AB and Orexo_US_Inc. ( collectively `` Orexo '' ) appeal the decision of the United_States_District_Court for the District of Delaware holding claims 1 3-6 and 8-10 of U.S._Patent_No._8940,330 ( `` the '330_Patent `` ) invalid on the ground of obviousness.1 The '330_Patent entitled `` Abuse-Resistant Pharmaceutical Composition for the Treatment of Opioid Dependence '' claims a product having the brand name ZubsolvTHE_R approved by the FDA for treatment of opioid_dependence

Actavis Elizabeth LLC ( `` Actavis '' ) filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application ( `` ANDA '' ) for a generic counter-part of Zubsolv accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification leading to this Hatch-Waxman litigation in accordance with 21 U.S.C.¡± 355 ( j ) and 35 U.S.C.¡± 271 ( e ) ( 2 ) ( A )
Two Orexo patents were challenged by Actavis but U.S._Patent_No._8454,996 ( `` the '996_Patent `` ) entitled `` Pharmaceutical Composition *1267 for the Treatment of Acute Disorders '' which was held valid in the district_court is not involved in this appeal

We reverse the judgment of invalidity of the '330_Patent for we conclude that obviousness was not proved by clear and convincing evidence

BACKGROUND
A
The '330_Patent
The '330_Patent specification explains that opioid-based pharmaceutical products intended for the relief of pain have become a source of addiction dependency and abuse
Treatment for opioid addiction includes a protocol called `` substitution_therapy '' where partial opioid agonists2 that have higher binding affinities at opioid receptors but produce lowered dependency than full agonists like heroin can lead to cessation of addiction by relieving the opioid craving
The prior_art shows use for this purpose of the partial agonist buprenorphine administered in sublingual_tablets and in oral films

The '330_Patent explains that while buprenorphine has less narcotic effect than a full opioid addicts were known to dissolve the buprenorphine from the substitution_therapy tablet and inject the dissolved buprenorphine intravenously to achieve an enhanced opioid effect
To counteract this abuse it was known to combine buprenorphine with the opioid antagonist3 naloxone in substitution_therapy

It was known that formulations containing buprenorphine to naloxone at a ratio of 4:1 provide the therapeutically optimal balance for sublingual treatment
Naloxone has poor transmucosal bioavailability so that if the mixture is taken in tablet_form as directed the buprenorphine will act as intended to treat opioid_dependence with little_interference from the naloxone
However if the tablet is dissolved and injected the naloxone will antagonize the effects of the buprenorphine resulting in withdrawal symptoms and thus deterring abuse of the formulation
The 4:1 ratio provides for appropriate pharmacological amounts of naloxone to deter abuse when injected but does not interfere with buprenorphine when taken in tablet_form
'330_Patent col._2,_ll._13-22 ; id. col._9,_ll._37-50
However naloxone 's `` functional blockade of buprenorphine 's action is also only partial and is short-lived in its nature '' id. col._2,_ll._23-25 and there was a continuing need for improvement in substitution_therapy formulations

The '330_Patent is for a sublingual_tablet_formulation that is less subject to abuse
The formulation enhances the agonist effectiveness of buprenorphine permitting a reduced amount of buprenorphine in the tablet and thus reducing the amount available on dissolving and injecting the product
In this formulation microparticles of buprenorphine are adhered to the surface of carrier_particles of citric_acid and the formulation also contains naloxone in the 4:1 ratio
The '330_Patent explains that the buprenorphine in the microparticles acts *1268 with little_interference from the naloxone but if the tablet is dissolved in water for injection into the bloodstream the naloxone will also be dissolved and will antagonize buprenorphine 's effects

All parties agree that the product in the '330_Patent provides improved treatment of opioid_dependence as compared with the prior_art
The '330_Patent specification includes data from clinical trials comparing the related sublingual product SuboxoneTHE_R
Patent Example 2 shows a 66 % improvement in bioavailability of buprenorphine and Patent Examples 7_and_8 show bioequivalent results for a sublingual_tablet containing 29 % less buprenorphine than in Suboxone tablets

Actavis does not dispute the improvement or its value in treatment of addiction
Rather Actavis argues that this formulation is obvious based on a combination of references and that improved function and use are irrelevant if the product is obvious
This theory is flawed for an unobvious improvement in properties or use is highly relevant to patentability of a new product

Claims 1_and_6 were deemed representative : 1
A tablet composition suitable for sublingual administration comprising : microparticles of a pharmacologically-effective_amount of buprenorphine or a pharmaceutically-acceptable_salt thereof presented upon the surface of carrier_particles wherein microparticles of buprenorphine or a pharmaceutically acceptable_salt thereof are in contact with particles comprising citric_acid wherein the buprenorphine or pharmaceutically acceptable_salt thereof and the citric_acid are not in the same particle ; a pharmacologically-effective_amount of naloxone or a pharmaceutically-acceptable_salt thereof ; and a disintegrant selected from the group consisting of croscarmellose sodium sodium starch glycolate crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone and mixtures thereof
6
The composition as claimed in claim 1 wherein the particles of citric_acid are presented and act as carrier_particles
The district_court found that all the ingredients in the claims were generally known and held that although the specific formulation was not shown or suggested in any reference the new combination would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill
However the prior_art does not show or suggest the claimed combination and does not show or suggest that this combination would achieve enhanced therapeutic effect while being less subject to abuse
