BACKGROUND
I. Prima_Tek and Polypap are competitors in the floral products market
Polypap is a French business that sells a product in the United States called the Bouquett ' O ( `` the accused product '' )
The accused product is a semicircular piece of plastic that can be formed into a disposable device for holding floral arrangements
On March_29,_1999 Prima_Tek filed suit against Polypap for infringement of inter *1286 alia claim 15 of the '856_patent and claim 9 of the '532_patent
The district_court granted summary judgment of non-infringement in favor of Polypap which decision was appealed to this court
Prima_Tek_II L.L.C
v. Polypap S.A.R.L. 318_F.3d_1143 1145 ( Fed.Cir.2003 )
We held that the district_court had used an incorrect claim construction vacated the decision and remanded for further proceedings
Id.at 1154
We specifically held that the phrase `` floral_holding_material having an upper end a lower end and an outer peripheral surface the floral_holding_material being constructed of a material capable of receiving a portion of the floral_grouping and supporting the floral_grouping without any pot means '' must be given its ordinary meaning and is not limited to floral foam or soil
Id.at 1149 1152

After a bench trial the district_court held the asserted claims of the patents not invalid and infringed by Polypap and accordingly enjoined Polypap from making using or selling the accused product or instructing others in its use
The district_court rejected Prima_Tek 's claims that Polypap was liable for induced and contributory_infringement
The district_court also rejected Polypap 's claim that Prima_Tek engaged in inequitable conduct in the prosecution of the patents
Polypap appeals and Prima_Tek cross-appeals from the district_court 's judgment of no induced or contributory_infringement
