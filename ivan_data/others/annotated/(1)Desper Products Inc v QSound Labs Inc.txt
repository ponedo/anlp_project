Before PLAGER CLEVENGER and GAJARSA Circuit_Judges
Opinion
PLAGER Circuit_Judge
Desper Products Inc. and Spatializer_Audio_Laboratories Inc. ( collectively `` Desper '' ) sued QSound Labs Inc. ( `` QSound '' ) owner of U.S. Patent Nos._5105,462 ( the '462_patent ) and 5,208,860 ( the '860_patent ) in the United_States_District_Court for the Central_District of California ( No
CV 94-7276 )
Desper sought a declaratory judgment that Desper 's `` Spatializer '' product does not infringe either patent and that the patents are invalid
QSound counterclaimed for patent_infringement
The district_court entered summary_judgment for Desper and QSound appeals
Because the district_court correctly interpreted the disputed claim_language and properly concluded that QSound surrendered subject matter within which Desper 's `` Spatializer '' product falls we affirm the judgment for Desper

BACKGROUND
This case involves two patents the '462_patent and the '860_patent both entitled *1328 `` Sound Imaging Method and Apparatus ''
At the trial level the case was assigned with the consent of the parties to a special_master
The parties filed cross-motions for summary_judgment with regard to the question of infringement
After considering both parties ' submissions and after conducting an extensive hearing during which both sides put on expert testimony the special_master recommended that judgment of non-infringement be entered in favor of Desper with one exception in which the special_master deemed the infringement of certain claims to involve a disputed question of fact precluding summary_judgment

The district_court adopted all of the special_master 's recommendations except the one in which the master thought there existed a genuine dispute of material fact
The district_court concluded that Desper was entitled to summary_judgment of non-infringement on all the asserted claims
The district_court entered final judgment of non-infringement in Desper 's favor under Fed.R.Civ.P
54 ( b )
QSound now appeals that ruling
