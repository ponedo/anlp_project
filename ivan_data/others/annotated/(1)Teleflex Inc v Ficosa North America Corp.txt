Opinion
LINN Circuit_Judge
Ficosa North America Corporation Fico_Cables S.A. and Ficosa North America S.A. de C.V. ( `` Ficosa '' ) appeal the final_judgment of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern_District of Michigan entered in favor of Teleflex Inc. ( `` Teleflex '' )
The district_court entered judgment following a jury_verdict that Ficosa infringed Teleflex 's U.S. Patent No._5632,182 ( `` the ¡¬182_patent `` ) and that Teleflex 's U.S. Patent No._4581,953 ( `` the ¡¬953_patent `` ) and the ¡¬182_patent were not invalid
Ficosa appeals the denial of its motion for judgment as a matter of law ( `` JMOL '' ) of non-infringement of claim 1 of the ¡¬182_patent the grant of summary_judgment of no best_mode_violation in the ¡¬182_patent the denial of its JMOL_motion of invalidity of the ¡¬ 182 patent and the denial of its JMOL_motion of invalidity of the ¡¬953_patent
Because the district_court correctly granted summary_judgment of no best_mode_violation and substantial evidence supports the jury_verdict of infringement and validity we affirm the district_court 's decision on appeal

BACKGROUND
Teleflex is the assignee of the ¡¬182_patent and the ¡¬953_patent
The ¡¬ 182 patent is directed to a `` Serviceable_Clip_Core_Coupling '' which is a component of a two-piece_shift_cable installed by General Motors ( `` GM '' ) in certain sport utility vehicles
The two-piece_shift_cable connects the shift_knob with the automatic transmission of the sport utility vehicle so that when a driver moves the shift_knob e.g. from `` Park '' to `` Drive '' the transmission is engaged
The two-piece cable allows GM to wait until an advanced stage of the manufacturing process before putting the two pieces together and permits the cable to be taken apart later for servicing

Claim 1 of the ¡¬182_patent recites :

1
A motion transmitting remote control assembly ( 10 ) comprising : a first_core_element_section ( 12 ) for transmitting motion ; a first guide length for movably supporting said first_core_element_section ( 12 ) ; a second_core_element_section ( 14 ) for transmitting motion ; a second guide length for movably supporting said second_core_element_section ( 14 ) ; connection means for locking said first ( 12 ) and second ( 14 ) core_element_sections together in a locked position mechanically prevented from moving relative to one another axially in either direction ; and
characterized by said connection means including a clip ( 28 ) manually insertable into and manually removable from said locked position mechanically interlocking said core_element_sections together while moving axially within said guide lengths said connection means including a female_member ( 24 ) attached to an end of said first_core_element_section ( 12 ) and a male_member ( 26 ) defining an end of said second_core_element_section ( 14 ) said male_member ( 26 ) presenting a male_groove ( 30 ) said female_member ( 24 ) having at least one slot ( 32 ) extending tangentially therethrough said clip ( 28 ) being disposed about said female_member ( 24 ) and extending through said slot ( 32 ) and into said male_groove *1319 ( 30 ) for mechanically interlocking said core_element_sections together in said locked position
'182_Patent col._3,_ll._45-66 col._4,_ll._1-10 ( emphases added )

The parties disputed at trial the interpretation of the claim term `` clip ( 28 ) ''
The district_court construed the term in the jury instructions as follows : In claim 1 of the ¡¬182_patent the term `` clip '' means a structure that has a single pair of legs which provide the dual functions of disposing the clip around and holding the female_member through the slots in the female_member and extending through the slots into the groove in the male_member to lock the members together

Figure 1 of the ¡¬182_patent is reproduced below :

?
The ¡¬953_patent is directed to a `` Molded Terminal with Vibration Dampener Pocket ''
The ¡¬953_patent describes an invention that allows for attachment of the shift cable to the shift_knob and the transmission in a manner that minimizes noise and vibration transmitted from the transmission to the shift_knob

Claim 1 of the ¡¬953_patent recites : 1
A motion transmitting remote control assemly [ sic ] ( 10 ) for transmitting motion in a curved path said assembly ( 10 ) comprising : guide_means ( 12 ) ; core_means ( 18 ) movably supported by said guide_means ( 12 ) and extending therefrom to provide a variable extending length of said core_means ( 18 ) between said guide_means ( 12 ) and one end ( 20 ) therefor to define a line of force ; and an integral terminal_member ( 22 ) for operatively interconnecting said extending length of said core_means ( 18 ) and a control_member ( 24 ) through a ball_pin ( 32 ) and having an opening ( 36 ) therethrough defining an axis being perpendicular relative to said line of force said terminal_member ( 22 ) including a resilient integral vibration dampening member ( 38 ) totally encapsulated therein and defining a portion of said opening ( 36 ) and including a retaining pocket for retaining the ball_pin ( 32 ) of the control_member ( 24 ) therein said retaining pocket including a resilient cylindrical wall ( 40 ) and an annular integral flexible flange ( 42 ) extending into said opening ( 36 ) from said wall ( 40 ) for engaging and retaining the ball_pin ( 32 ) extending from the control_member ( 24 ) within *1320 said cylindrical wall ( 40 ) said vibration dampening member ( 38 ) further including a resilient substantially cylindrical containing pocket extending from said flexible flange ( 42 ) and away from said retaining pocket

Claim 6 of the ¡¬953_patent recites : 6
An assembly as set forth in claim 1 further characterized by said terminal_member ( 22 ) including a plurality of slots ( 56 ) therethrough extending radially from said axis defined by said opening ( 36 ) about said retaining pocket of said opening ( 36 )

?
Both Teleflex and Ficosa manufacture shift cables for automobiles
Teleflex has traditionally focused on the North American market and Ficosa on the European market
In 1990 they entered a joint venture to sell cables in Europe but the venture was dissolved in 1997

Teleflex supplied GM with two-piece_shift_cables from the inception of the `` GMT-800_program '' for use in GM manufactured sport utility vehicles
In 1997 Teleflex learned of Ficosa 's efforts to supply GM with cables for the GMT-800_program and the parties exchanged letters concerning possible infringement by Ficosa of Teleflex 's patents
Ficosa retained European patent counsel for an opinion concerning infringement of the European equivalent of the ¡¬182_patent

Ficosa had its own design for the two-piece_shift_cable
An illustration of the Ficosa counterpart to the `` clip ( 28 ) '' recited in claim 1 of the ¡¬182_patent is reproduced below :

*1321. ?
On August 3 1998 Teleflex sued Ficosa for infringement of four patents including the ¡¬182 and ¡¬953_patent s. Ficosa counterclaimed for declaratory_judgment of non-infringement and invalidity of all of the asserted patents
Teleflex voluntarily withdrew its claim based on one of the four patents and the district_court granted Ficosa 's motion for partial_summary_judgment of non-infringement of another patent
These two patents were removed from the case and the present appeal concerns only the remaining ¡¬182 and ¡¬ 953 patents

On August 30 1999 Teleflex moved for partial_summary_judgment of literal_infringement of claim 1 of the ¡¬182_patent which the district_court granted on December 15 1999
Six days prior to trial Ficosa filed a motion to vacate the ruling of literal_infringement of claim 1 in light of new evidence : the September 19 2000 issuance of a patent to Ficosa
The district_court granted Ficosa 's motion and vacated its partial_summary_judgment ruling regarding claim 1 of the ¡¬182_patent

The parties filed cross-motions for summary_judgment concerning violation of the best_mode_requirement in the ¡¬182_patent
Ficosa argued that the inventor admitted during his deposition that he knew of a best_mode for practicing the claimed invention in the following colloquy : Q : Now that change in the clip_metal and the matching of the male_member_metal to the clip_metal was that the best way that you had to make this cable join at the time you did this work in 1995 ?
A : Yeah
Yep yep
Yes

Teleflex responded that the inventor clarified later in his deposition that the clip *1322 metal and matching of the male_member_metal to the clip_metal was done to satisfy GM 's requests to reduce the insertion force and connector size and the invention would work without these customer-specific details : Q : Was the change in material on the core element connect as referenced in the section of the deposition that I read to you a moment ago critical to getting the core_element_connect_design to meet General Motors specification or was it critical to getting the core_element_connect_design to work at all ?
A : To meet General Motors requirements
That was the problem

On December 15 1999 the district_court granted Teleflex 's motion finding no violation of the best_mode_requirement
In its order the court discussed the inventor 's deposition testimony and then stated : In cases such as this one satisfying requests of specific customer [ sic ] can be an exception to the best_mode rule..
In this case the ¡¬182_patent does not claim a cable_assembly for the 1999 GM full-size pickup truck just a cable_assembly
Thus the best_mode does not include details particular to 1999 GM pickups
Teleflex conceded during closing argument that it could not prove literal_infringement of claims 1_and_6 of the ¡¬953_patent

The following issues went to the jury : ( 1 ) infringement of claim 1 of the ¡¬ 182 patent ( 2 ) validity of claim 1 of the ¡¬182_patent ( 3 ) validity of claims 1_and_6 of the ¡¬953_patent and ( 4 ) damages if any awarded to Teleflex for infringement by Ficosa of claim 1 of the ¡¬182_patent
On January 8 2001 the jury found claim 1 of the ¡¬182_patent not invalid and infringed and found damages of $ 552,778.00
The jury also found claims 1_and_6 of the ¡¬953_patent to be not invalid

The parties filed various JMOL_motions after the verdict
The district_court entered final_judgment on May_9,_2001 awarding Teleflex damages of $ 552,778.00 plus interest and costs and permanently enjoined Ficosa from infringing the ¡¬ 182 patent

Ficosa appeals the denial of its JMOL_motion of non-infringement of claim 1 of the ¡¬182_patent the grant of summary_judgment of no best_mode_violation in the ¡¬182_patent the denial of its JMOL_motion of invalidity of the ¡¬182_patent and the denial of its JMOL_motion of invalidity of the ¡¬953_patent

Exclusive jurisdiction is vested in this court pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
