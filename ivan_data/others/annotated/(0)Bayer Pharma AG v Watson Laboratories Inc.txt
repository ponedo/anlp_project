Opinion
Moore Circuit_Judge
Watson Laboratories Inc. appeals the District of Delaware 's final judgment holding Watson failed to prove by clear and convincing_evidence that claims 9_and_11 of U.S. Patent No._8613,950 ( `` the '950_patent `` ) would have been obvious
We hold the district_court clearly erred in finding a skilled artisan would not have been motivated to use the claim elements
Considering the district_court 's clear error together with the remainder of its fact findings we conclude that claims 9_and_11 of the '950_patent would have been obvious
We therefore reverse

BACKGROUND
In 2003 the Food & Drug Administration ( `` FDA '' ) granted Bayer1 approval to market vardenafil hydrochloride_trihydrate to treat erectile dysfunction ( `` ED '' ) under the name Levitra
Vardenafil belongs to a class of ED_drugs called phosphodiesterase inhibitors
When the FDA approved Levitra two other phosphodiesterase inhibitors were already on the market : Pfizer launched sildenafil under the name Viagra in 1998 and Eli Lilly launched tadalafil under the name Cialis in 2003
Levitra Viagra and Cialis are each formulated as immediate-release tablets that are swallowed whole

The '950_patent issued on December 24 2013
It claims priority to March_1,_2005 and lists Bayer as its assignee
It is directed to a formulation of vardenafil `` in the form of an uncoated_tablet which disintegrates rapidly in the mouth '' commonly referred to as an oral_disintegrating_tablet ( `` ODT '' )
See '950_patent at claim 8
Bayer markets a commercial embodiment of the '950_patent vardenafil ODT under the name Staxyn

Watson filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application ( `` ANDA '' ) with the FDA seeking approval to market a generic version of Staxyn
Bayer filed the instant case asserting infringement of the '950_patent
Claims *1320 9_and_11 both of which depend from claim 8 are the only claims at issue : 8
A drug_formulation in the form of an uncoated_tablet which disintegrates rapidly in the mouth and releases the drug in the mouth without swallowing the tablet comprising vardenafil hydrochloride_trihydrate and at least two sugar_alcohols
9
The drug_formulation according to claim 8 wherein said sugar_alcohols are a mixture of sorbitol and mannitol
11
The drug_formulation of claim 8 wherein at least one sugar alcohol is sorbitol
The parties agree that claim 8 's requirement that the formulation `` releases the drug in the mouth '' means it is an immediate-release_formulation

The district_court held a six-day bench trial to consider the validity of the '950_patent
Watson argued the claimed formulation of vardenafil would have been obvious to a person of ordinary_skill in the art based on multiple exemplary references showing a motivation to : ( 1 ) create an ODT_formulation of vardenafil2 ; ( 2 ) select mannitol and sorbitol as sugar_alcohols3 ; and ( 3 ) make the ODT_formulation immediate-release
The district_court rejected each of Watson 's arguments
It found a person of ordinary_skill in the art would not have been motivated to create an ODT_formulation of vardenafil and would not have used mannitol and sorbitol as excipients
It found the prior art taught away from formulating vardenafil ODT as immediate-release
The district_court also addressed Bayer 's objective evidence of nonobviousness and found it supported its conclusion that Watson failed to prove by clear and convincing_evidence that claims 9_and_11 would have been obvious
Watson appeals
We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
