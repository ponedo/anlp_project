Synopsis
Patent assignee brought action for infringement of patent on drying machine used in making paper
Competitor counterclaimed for infringement of two of competitor 's patents
The United_States_District_Court for the Western_District of Wisconsin Barbara B. Crabb J. 895_F.Supp._1158 granted summary_judgment that assignee 's patent was not infringed and that it did not anticipate competitor 's two patents and following jury_trial entered judgment that competitor 's patents were valid and infringed

Opinion
RICH Circuit_Judge
Appellants Valmet Paper Machinery Inc. and Valmet Inc. ( collectively `` Valmet '' ) sued Beloit Corporation for infringement of Valmet 's patent on a drying machine used in making paper
Beloit counterclaimed for infringement of two patents it holds on drying-machine inventions
The district_court granted summary_judgment that Valmet 's patent was not infringed and that it did not anticipate Beloit 's two patents
Following a jury_trial the court entered judgment that Beloit 's patents were valid and infringed and granted Beloit an injunction against further infringement
Valmet appeals

BACKGROUND
The patents in suit relate to the final drying portion of paper-making machinery
In *1410 the paper-making process a system of large machines sprays a suspension of fiber and water onto a moving web
The machines then maneuver the wet web through a series of steps to remove the water beginning with the formation stage where water drains from the web by operation of gravity
The second stage generally involves pressing additional water from the web with rollers
The last stage the area of the inventions in this appeal features heated drying cylinders designed to evaporate the remaining moisture as the web comes in contact with them

The heated-cylinder segment of the drying process presents several challenges
The paper_web moves through the drying machines at high speed and these machines must avoid stretching or tearing the web
At the same time the machines must dry the paper as evenly as possible including both the top and bottom surfaces of the web
Conventionally this stage has employed heated_cylinders in a `` two tier '' setup
In a two-tier arrangement one row of cylinders lies in an upper plane and a second_row of cylinders lies in a lower plane
Looking along the length of a two-tier drying section the sequence of cylinders applied alternates between the upper and lower planes such that the next_cylinder in order is on the opposite plane
The paper_web runs beneath a lower-plane_cylinder then over an upper-plane_cylinder then under a lower-plane_cylinder and so on
The lower cylinders apply heat to the top surface of the paper and the upper cylinders to the bottom surface
This figure depicts a prior art two-tier dryer.1

Problems arise from `` open draws '' where the paper_web must cross unsupported through an open space to the next_cylinder
As the web speeds from under a bottom cylinder up to make contact with the next upper cylinder for example the portion of the web not in contact with a cylinder tends to `` flutter ''
This increases the risk of stretching or breakage
Two-tier drying machines have employed felt guide_belts which accompany the web through the machine then circle back to the beginning of the machine to create a continuous loop as well as guide rollers to reduce the risk of damage to the web
A felt guide_belt traveling with the web however prevents the heated_cylinders from directly touching the web on the side adjacent to the felt

The first of the patents in suit the Soininen_patent No._3868,780 issued March_4,_1975 to Valmet as assignee
The Soininen_patent claims `` drying cylinder group [ s ] '' comprising `` two substantially parallel rows of drying cylinders '' where a guide_belt and guide_rolls direct the web along each cylinder in the first row before bringing the web to the start of the second_row rather than alternating around cylinders in two separate *1411 rows in different planes
After the first_group additional guide_rolls cause the guide_belt to run along the opposite sides of the next group of drying cylinders
As a result drying cylinder groups apply direct heat to one side of the web in its first_group and the other_side in its second group
Soininen also discusses inclusion of `` foraminous '' ( i.e. perforated ) guide_rolls and claims a structure where walls enclose the sides of the guide_belt loops
Forming a closed space inside the belt facilitates introduction of a vacuum in that space to pull the paper_web outside the guide_belt more tightly onto the belt and rolls
The following figure comes from the Soininen_patent.2

?
-- -- -

In 1981 a German patent application citing Soininen elaborated on the vacuum aspect of the Soininen invention
This Hauser_application taught that it is more efficient to place individual suction devices within each of Soininen 's perforated guide_rolls instead of using large walls to close off the entire space inside a guide_belt
Hauser also emphasized benefits from moving the `` suction guide_rolls '' closer to the heated drying cylinders to keep the web in contact with rolls or cylinders as much as possible
Although no patent issued the Hauser_application was published February 17 1983
Beloit submitted only the German-language version of the Hauser publication to the patent_examiner during prosecution of the two Beloit patents discussed below

More recently Beloit obtained patents on features of its `` Bel-Champ '' drying machine including patents No._5144,758 ( '758_patent ) issued September 8 1992 from an application filed November 14 1991 and No._5249,372 ( '372_patent ) issued October 5 1993 from an application filed April_9,_1992
Basically Beloit 's patents claim a `` single tier drying section '' comprising `` a first plurality of drying cylinders '' with its own `` dryer felt '' and `` vacuum_rolls.. in close_proximity '' to their adjacent drying cylinders for drying one side of the paper_web followed by a second mirror-image section for drying the other_side of the web
Beloit argues that 1 ) the single-tier design 2 ) the use of vacuum_rolls and 3 ) the close_proximity of the vacuum_rolls to the drying cylinders distinguish its invention from prior art dryer designs including Soininen and Hauser
Below is a figure from one of the Beloit patents.3

*1412. ?

Valmet sued Beloit in the United_States_District_Court for the Western_District of Wisconsin alleging infringement of the Soininen_patent and to invalidate Beloit 's '758 and '372_patent s due to either anticipation or obviousness
Beloit counterclaimed for infringement
The district_court granted summary_judgment that Beloit had not infringed the Soininen_patent and that Soininen did not anticipate Beloit 's patents
A four-part trial followed
Dealing first with validity a jury found claims 1_and_2 of the '372_patent and claims 1-3 of the '758_patent not obvious but found claim 3 of the '758_patent and claims 1_and_2 of the '372_patent indefinite and therefore invalid
As a result only claims 1_and_2 of the '758_patent remained
The jury then found that Valmet infringed those two claims literally and ( unnecessarily ) under the doctrine of equivalents
In part three the court ruled Beloit not guilty of inequitable conduct by failing to submit an English translation of Hauser to the patent_examiner
Last the jury found Valmet 's infringement not willful and awarded Beloit lost profits from Valmet 's sale of an infringing drying machine in New Mexico

After the verdict the district_court denied Valmet 's motion for judgment as a matter of law ( `` JMOL '' ) seeking to invalidate the first two claims of the '758_patent
Instead the court granted Beloit 's JMOL motion and overruled the jury 's findings of indefiniteness
The district_court then awarded damages to Beloit and granted an injunction barring future infringement by Valmet of either the '758 or the '372_patent
