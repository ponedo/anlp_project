ATLAS POWDER COMPANY Plaintiff and
Hanex_Products Inc. Plaintiff-Appellant v. IRECO INCORPORATED and ICI_Explosives_USA Inc. Defendants-Appellees
No._99-1041
| Sept._7,_1999
Synopsis
Licensee under patents claiming explosive_compositions brought infringement action
Patent owner intervened as plaintiff and obtained right to control the litigation
Following bench trial the United_States_District_Court for the District of Wyoming Alan B. Johnson Chief_Judge held patents invalid as anticipated and owner appealed
The Court of Appeals Rader Circuit_Judge held that : ( 1 ) patents ' reference to `` sufficient_aeration '' included both porous air and interstitial_air and ( 2 ) patents were invalid as anticipated

Opinion
RADER Circuit_Judge
The United_States_District_Court for the District of Wyoming determined that U.S. Patent No._4111,727 ( the Clay_patent ) and its reissue U.S. Patent No
RE 33,788 ( the reissue_patent ) were invalid
Atlas Powder Company ( Atlas ) a licensee under those patents sued IRECO_Incorporated ( IRECO ) for infringement of the Clay_patent
Following two bench trials the district_court concluded that both the original Clay_patent and the reissue_patent were invalid as anticipated by either U.S. Patent No._3161,551 ( Egly ) or U.K. Patent No._1306,546 ( Butterworth )
Because the district_court correctly interpreted the claims and applied the law of anticipation this court affirms the finding of invalidity

I
The Clay_patent and its reissue both claim explosive_compositions
To detonate *1344 explosives require both fuel and oxidizers
The oxidizer rapidly reacts with the fuel to produce expanding gases and heat - an explosion
Composite explosives mix various sources of fuel and oxygen
The most widely used and economical composite explosive is ammonium_nitrate and fuel_oil ( ANFO )
ANFO_explosives mix about 94 % by weight of ammonium_nitrate ( AN ) the oxidizer with 6 % by weight of fuel_oil ( FO )
The AN may include porous prills dense prills Stengel flakes or crystalline AN
ANFO_explosives have two primary disadvantages
First wet conditions dissolve the AN and make the explosive unusable in damp settings
Second ANFO is a relatively weak explosive because interstitial_air occupies considerable space in the mixture thereby decreasing the amount of explosive_material per unit of volume

To address these shortcomings explosive experts developed water-in-oil_emulsions
These emulsions dissolved the oxidizer into water and then dispersed the solution in oil
Because oil surrounds the oxidizer it is resistant to moisture thus solving one of the problems with ANFO
Emulsions also increased the explosive 's bulk strength by increasing the density of explosive_material in the mixture
Emulsions however also have a disadvantage
Emulsions will not detonate unless sensitized
Sensitivity of a blasting composition refers to the ease of igniting its explosion
Experts generally sensitize emulsions by using gassing agents or adding microballoons throughout the mixture
The gassing agents or microballoons provide tiny_gas or air_bubbles throughout the mixture
Upon detonation the gas pockets compress and heat up thereby igniting the fuel around them
In other words the tiny_gas or air_bubbles act as `` hot spots '' to propagate the explosion

The Clay_patent and its reissue both claim composite explosives made from the combination of an ANFO blasting composition and an unsensitized water-in-oil_emulsion
Both patents claim essentially the same blasting composition
Claim one of the reissue_patent recites : 1
A blasting composition consisting essentially of 10_to_40 % by weight of a greasy water-in-oil_emulsion and 60_to_90 % of a substantially undissolved particulate solid oxidizer salt constituent wherein the emulsion comprises about 3_to_15 % by weight of water about 2_to_15 % of oil 70_to_90 % of powerful oxidizer salt comprising ammonium_nitrate which may include other powerful oxidizer salts wherein the solid constituent comprises ammonium_nitrate and in which sufficient_aeration is entrapped to enhance sensitivity to a substantial degree and wherein the emulsion component is emulsified by inclusion of 0.BIG_TOKEN__1_to_5__BIG_TOKEN % by weight based on the total composition of an [ oil-in-water ] water-in-oil emulsifier to hold the aqueous content in the disperse or internal phase

When this lawsuit began Atlas was the exclusive licensee under the Clay_patent in the continental U.S. and Hawaii
Atlas commenced this lawsuit against IRECO in 1986 alleging infringement of the Clay_patent
During the course of litigation Dr. Robert Clay the inventor filed a reissue petition with the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( PTO )
Atlas then moved to stay the litigation pending resolution of the reissue_application
The district_court denied that motion and conducted a first bench trial on the issues of validity and infringement of the Clay_patent in October 1986
Dr._Clay then requested suspension of prosecution of the reissue_application by the PTO in February 1987
After waiting several years for a decision from the district_court Dr._Clay requested that the PTO reinstate the reissue proceedings in 1990
In January 1992 the Clay_reissue_patent issued upon surrender of the original patent
Later that *1345 year the district_court rendered its findings and judgment regarding the validity and infringement of the Clay_patent

In its 1992 judgment the district_court found claims 1 2 3 10 12 13 and 14 of the Clay_patent invalid as anticipated by either one of two prior art references Egly or Butterworth
Egly and Butterworth each disclose blasting compositions containing a water-in-oil_emulsion and ANFO with ingredients identical to those of the Clay_patents in overlapping amounts
The following chart illustrates the overlap between the explosive_compositions disclosed in the prior art patents and the Clay_reissue_patent :
