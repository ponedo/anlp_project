United States Court of Appeals Federal Circuit
PLANTRONICS INC. Plaintiff-Appellant v. ALIPH INC. and Aliphcom Inc. Defendants-Appellees
No._2012-1355
| July_31,_2013
Synopsis
Background : Patentee filed action against competitor alleging infringement of patent directed toward concha-style_headset for transmitting received sounds to ear of user e.g. headsets used with cell_phone_receivers
Parties consented to final disposition by magistrate judge
The United States District Court for the Northern District of California Bernard Zimmerman United States Magistrate Judge 2011_WL_4634066 construed the claims and then ruled that patent was invalid and not infringed 2012_WL_994636
Patentee appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Wallach Circuit_Judge held that :

term `` stabilizer_support_member '' meant structure that extended from ear_cushion to concha_stabilizer_pad and stabilized headset ;

term `` concha_stabilizer '' meant stabilizing structure dimensioned to extend between ear_cushion and upper_concha ;

prosecution history disclaimer doctrine could not be applied to limit terms `` stabilizer_support_member '' and `` concha_stabilizer '' to elongated structure ; and

factual issue existed as to whether patent was obvious

Reversed in part vacated in part and remanded

Opinion
WALLACH Circuit_Judge
In this patent infringement case Plantronics Inc. ( `` Plantronics '' ) filed suit alleging that Aliph Inc. and Aliphcom Inc. 's ( collectively `` Aliph '' ) products infringe *1346 U.S._Patent_No._5712,453 entitled `` Concha Headset Stabilizer '' ( the `` ¡¬453_patent `` )
On March_23,_2012 the district_court granted-in-part Aliph 's motion for summary_judgment of noninfringement and invalidity construing certain disputed terms finding in relevant_part that the accused products do not infringe claims 1_and_10 and holding the asserted claims invalid as obvious
Plantronics Inc. v. Aliph Inc. No

Decision '' )
The district_court 's decision is reversed in part vacated in part and remanded for further proceedings

BACKGROUND
The ¡¬453_patent is directed to a concha-style_headset for transmitting received sounds to the ear of a user e.g. headsets used with cell_phone_receivers
¡¬453_patent_col. 1_ll._13 -16
In particular the patent discloses an apparatus for stabilizing a concha_style_headset during use
Id
col. 2_ll._56 -63
Because the claimed apparatus requires some familiarity with the human ear an illustration is provided below :

?
Id
fig._3
Of particular relevance is the concha `` a deep cavity containing the entry to the ear_canal '' and which is divided into the upper and lower_concha 43_and_41
¡¬453_patent_col. 4_ll._50 -52
Prior art headset stabilizers included large supports outside the ear or relied on appendages to hook onto the crux of the helix 31
Id
col. 1_ll._20 -55
The ¡¬453_patent purports to improve upon prior art headset stabilizers
In particular the claimed headset consists of `` a receiver_attachment that couples to the body of the receiver a support_member extending from the receiver_attachment and a concha_stabilizer_pad coupled to the end of the support_member such that the concha_stabilizer_pad contacts the upper_concha under the antihelix of the ear with the receiver placed in the lower_concha in front of the ear_canal ''
Id.at [ 57 ]
Thus the concha_stabilizer_pad has three points of contact : the tragus the anti-tragus and the upper_concha
Id
col. 2_ll._2 -6
Certain embodiments of the claimed concha_stabilizer are depicted below :

?
*1347 Id
figs 1A 1B
The stabilizing concha_style_headset is described as typically including a receiver 27 and a voice tube 30
Id
col. 2. ll
64-65
A receiver_attachment comprises an ear_cushion 11 preferably dimensioned as an oblate spheroid formed of a reticulated fully open-pore flexible ester type polyurethane foam
Id
col. 2_l._66 -col. 3_l._2
The ear_cushion 11 has an open central recessed portion 13 forming a `` C '' shape which is dimensioned to fit snugly onto the receiver 27
Id
col. 3. ll
6-9
A flexible support_member stabilizer_support 17 extends from the upper surface of the ear_cushion 11
Id
col. 3_ll._18 -19
The end of the stabilizer_support 17 is coupled to a concha_stabilizer_pad 21 which contacts the upper_concha 43 beneath the antihelix
Id
col. 3_ll._26 -28
When placed into the lower_concha 41 during use the ear_cushion 11 contacts the tragus 35 and the antitragus 39 at a tragus_contact_point 23 and an antitragus_contact_point 25 respectively where the face 15 of the ear_cushion 11 rests in the lower_concha 41 and faces toward the ear_canal 33
Id
col. 3. ll
9-14
The left/right orientation of the tragus_contact_point 23 and the antitragus_contact_point 25 with respect to the face 15 of the ear_cushion 11 is reversed for the left and right ears
Id
col. 3_ll._14 -16

Independent_claim 1 is representative of the asserted claims : 1
An apparatus for stabilizing a headset including a receiver sized to fit between a tragus and an anti-tragus of an ear the apparatus comprising : an ear_cushion dimensioned to cover a portion of the receiver disposed between the tragus and the anti-tragus ; a resilient and flexible stabilizer_support_member coupled to the ear_cushion and dimensioned to fit within an upper_concha with the ear_cushion coupled to the receiver and the receiver disposed between the tragus and the anti-tragus ; and
a concha_stabilizer_pad coupled to the stabilizer_support_member for contacting the upper_concha
¡¬453_patent_col. 5_ll._10 -22 ( emphases added )
Independent_claim 10 is also relevant here and is recited below : 10
A headset comprising : a receiver sized to fit between a tragus and an anti-tragus of an ear the receiver having a tragus_contact_point and an anti-tragus_contact_point disposed substantially opposite to the tragus_contact_point ; *1348 an ear_cushion dimensioned to cover a portion of the receiver ; and
a concha_stabilizer coupled to the ear_cushion and dimensioned to contact an upper_concha between an antihelix and a crux of a helix with the receiver disposed between the tragus and the anti-tragus
Id

On January 15 2009 Plantronics filed the underlying patent infringement suit against Aliph originally asserting claims 1 7 10_and_11
Subsequently on November 9 2009 Aliph requested ex parte reexamination by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ( `` PTO '' ) of the asserted claims which the PTO granted
As a result the district_court litigation was stayed
In its request for reexamination Aliph argued that the asserted claims were invalid as anticipated and obvious in view of four prior art references : ( 1 ) U.S._Patent_No._1753,817 to Aber ( `` Aber '' ) ; ( 2 ) U.S._Patent_No._1893,143 to Koch ( `` Koch '' ) ; ( 3 ) U.S. Patent No._4720,857 to Burris et al
( `` Burris '' ) ; and ( 4 ) Japanese Application Publication No
JP58-104077 to Watanabe ( `` Watanabe '' )
On March_1,_2011 the PTO issued a reexamination certificate confirming the patentability of the challenged claims along with the addition of dependent_claims 16-56
Plantronics thereafter amended its infringement contentions to assert new claims 18 20-21 25-26 and 28-56 in addition to the originally asserted claims 1 7 10 and 11 ( collectively `` asserted claims '' )

On September 19 2011 the district_court issued a tentative claim construction order and held its Markman hearing on September 21 2011
On October 6 2011 the district_court issued its claim construction order construing in relevant_part the terms `` stabilizer_support_member '' in claim 1 and `` concha_stabilizer '' in claim 10
Plantronics Inc. v. Aliph Inc. No
C09-1714BZ 2011_WL_4634066 at *4 ( N.D.Cal
Oct._6,_2011 )
On March_23,_2012 the district_court granted summary_judgment holding the asserted claims were invalid and not infringed

In its summary_judgment decision the district_court provided further construction of a `` stabilizer_support_member '' and `` concha_stabilizer '' and in turn found no infringement of claims 1_and_10
Likewise the district_court held claims 1 7 10 11 18 20 21 26 28 30 43_and_44 of the ¡¬453_patent were invalid as obvious in light of the combination of U.S._Patent_No._1893,474 ( `` Lieber '' ) with Japanese Utility Patent Application No._60-40187 ( U ) ( `` Komoda '' )
Furthermore the district_court determined that dependent_claims 25 29 31-BIG_TOKEN__42_and_45__BIG_TOKEN -56 were obvious by the combination of the Lieber patent the Komoda patent and U.S._Patent_No._5048,090 ( `` Geers '' )
