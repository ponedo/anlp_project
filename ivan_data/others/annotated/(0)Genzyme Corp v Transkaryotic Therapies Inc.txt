Synopsis
Owner of patent for method of producing human enzyme sued competitor for infringement
The United_States_District_Court for the District of Delaware 2001_WL_1530375 Gregory M. Sleet J. granted summary_judgment of noninfringement and appeal was taken
The Court of Appeals Rader Circuit_Judge held that patent calling for insertion of exogenous genes encoding enzyme of interest into host_cell 's chromosomal material was not infringed by accused process which called for insertion of promoters which activated endogenous genes encoding enzyme of interest

RADER Circuit_Judge
The United_States_District_Court for the District of Delaware determined on summary_judgment that Transkaryotic_Therapies Inc. ( TKT ) did not infringe Genzyme Corporation 's and Mount_Sinai_School of Medicine 's ( collectively Genzyme ) patent on methods of producing the human enzyme £\galactosidase_A
Because Genzyme can not prove infringement of the properly construed claims this court affirms

I. Genzyme Corporation is the exclusive licensee of U.S. Patent No._5356,804 ( the ¡¬804_patent ) issued October 18 1994 and assigned on its face to Mount_Sinai_School of Medicine of New_York_University
The ¡¬804_patent claims a method of producing human_£\-galactosidase_A ( £\-Gal-A ) and cells engineered to express and secrete active human_£\-Gal-A
Administration of the £\-Gal_A protein treats patients suffering from Fabry disease a condition triggered by a deficiency in this enzyme

The claims at issue in this appeal are independent_claims 1_and_10 of the ¡¬ 804 patent which read as follows ( emphases added ) : 1
A method for producing human_£\-galactosidase_A comprising : ( a ) culturing a mammalian_cell containing a chromosomally integrated nucleotide_sequence encoding human_£\-galactosidase_A controlled by a regulatory_sequence that promotes gene_expression and a selectable_marker controlled by the same or different_regulatory_sequence so that the £\-galactosidase_A nucleotide_sequence is stably overexpressed and an enzymatically active_£\-galactosidase_A enzyme is secreted by the mammalian_cell ; and
( b ) isolating enzymatically active_£\-galactosidase_A enzyme from the mammalian_cell culture
10
A mammalian_cell comprising a chromosomally integrated nucleotide_sequence encoding human_£\-galactosidase_A controlled by a regulatory_sequence that promotes gene_expression and a selectable_marker controlled by the same or different_regulatory_sequence so that the £\-galactosidase_A nucleotide_sequence is stably overexpressed and an enzymatically active_£\-galactosidase_A enzyme is secreted by the mammalian_cell

Genzyme filed suit against TKT alleging infringement of the ¡¬804_patent
TKT 's allegedly infringing product involves a technique known as gene_activation
Under this technique a DNA sequence acting as a promoter is inserted into a human host_cell whereupon the endogenous human cellular gene encoding £\-Gal_A is activated to express the endogenous_human_£\-Gal_A protein
It is undisputed that TKT 's technique does not introduce an exogenous £\-Gal_A gene into human host_cells

The district_court construed independent_claims 1_and_10 of the ¡¬804_patent in a *1097 Markman hearing
See Markman v. Westview Instruments Inc. 52_F.3d_967_(Fed.Cir.1995) ( en banc ) aff 'd 517_U.S._370 116_S.Ct._1384 134_L.Ed.2d_577_(1996)
The trial court specifically addressed four disputed claim_terms
Of these disputed terms the most important is `` chromosomally integrated '' which the district_court defined to mean `` the combining or bringing together or merging of separate elements '' specifically the `` chromosome of a host_cell '' and `` an exogenous nucleotide_sequence encoding human_£\-galactosidase_A with a promoter and selectable_marker ''
Genzyme Corp. v. Transkaryotic_Therapies Inc. No._00-677- GMS 2001_WL_1530375 at *1 ( D.Del
Nov.28 2001 )

Following the Markman proceedings both Genzyme and TKT moved for summary_judgment on infringement
In its summary_judgment_motion for noninfringement TKT explained that it produces human_£\-Gal_A from cells genetically engineered to overproduce this enzyme via gene_activation
TKT 's gene_activation process permits controlled expression of endogenous_human_£\-Gal_A in target cells
TKT argued it does not practice the claimed method because the `` chromosomally integrated '' limitation requires exogenously introduced gene sequences a step the gene_activation protocol does not utilize

A week after filing its motion for summary_judgment of infringement Genzyme asked the district_court to clarify its interpretation of the claim term `` chromosomally integrated '' particularly with respect to the meaning of the phrase `` exogenous nucleotide ''
The district_court complied with Genzyme 's request stating that the term `` exogenous '' referred to nucleotide_sequences `` exogenous to the host_cell not exogenous to the chromosomal site ''
Based on this meaning of the term `` chromosomally integrated '' Genzyme conceded it could not prevail on infringement
Thereafter the district_court issued an order granting TKT 's summary_judgment_motion

Genzyme timely appealed the district_court 's decision arguing that the district_court erred in defining the claim_terms `` chromosomally integrated '' `` regulatory_sequence '' `` stably '' and `` comprising ''
This court has exclusive jurisdiction to hear Genzyme 's appeal
