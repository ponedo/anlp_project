Opinion
*1324 CLEVENGER Circuit_Judge
TorPharm Inc. appeals the judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the District of New_Jersey which granted summary_judgment to Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals Inc. Schein_Pharmaceutical Inc. Danbury_Pharmacal Inc. Ranbaxy_Laboratories_Limited Ranbaxy Schein Pharma LLC and Ranbaxy_Schein_Pharmaceuticals LLC ( collectively `` Ranbaxy '' ) invalidating TorPharm 's United_States_Patent_No._5670,671 ( `` ¡¬671 '' ) as obvious
TorPharm Inc. v. Ranbaxy_Pharms. Inc. No._99-_CV-714 ( D.N.J
Aug._6,_2002 )
Because TorPharm had relied on the novelty of its `` improved Form 1 ranitidine '' product in prosecuting the ¡¬671_process_claims the district_court ruled that the subsequent negation of improved Form 1 ranitidine 's novelty in unrelated litigation precluded TorPharm from rebutting Ranbaxy 's obviousness challenge to the ¡¬671_process_claims
We hold that despite TorPharm 's assertion of improved Form 1 ranitidine 's novelty during prosecution of the ¡¬671_patent the lack of novelty of the product does not by itself establish that the process for making it is obvious
We therefore reverse the grant of summary_judgment of invalidity and remand the case for further proceedings

I
This appeal concerns the validity of a patent on a process for making the drug ranitidine
Ranitidine is an antihistamine drug that inhibits acid secretion in the stomach and is used to treat ulcers
Several patents covering different crystalline forms of ranitidine are owned by nonparty Glaxo Inc. and have been the subject of extensive litigation
Glaxo Group v. TorPharm Inc. 153_F.3d_1366 47_USPQ2d_1836_(Fed.Cir.1998) ; Glaxo Inc. v. Novopharm_Ltd. 110_F.3d_1562 42_USPQ2d_1257_(Fed.Cir.1997) ; Glaxo Inc. v. Novopharm_Ltd. 52_F.3d_1043 34_USPQ2d_1565_(Fed.Cir.1995)
That litigation has concerned `` Form 2 ranitidine '' a crystalline form of ranitidine that overcame the undesirable drying and filtration characteristics of the original crystalline form `` Form 1 ranitidine ''

The patent in suit owned by TorPharm relates to a different crystalline form of ranitidine referred to as `` improved Form 1 ranitidine ''
The ¡¬671_patent discloses a process for producing improved Form 1 ranitidine by crystallizing ranitidine from a solution in isopropyl alcohol
According to the patent specification improved Form 1 ranitidine `` has characteristics of being harder and denser and providing larger sized crystals '' which gives it acceptable filtration and drying characteristics
¡¬671_patent col._3,_ll._26-27
Improved Form 1 ranitidine is distinguished from Form 1 ranitidine by two properties reflecting these characteristics : bulk_density and tap_density
According to the patent improved Form 1 ranitidine is characterized by a bulk_density of at least 0.23 gm/ml and a tap_density of at least 0.28 gm/ml.1 Id.at ll
31-32

All claims of the ¡¬671_patent are directed to a process for producing improved Form 1 ranitidine
Representative claim 2 illustrates the two principal requirements of the claimed process : that it yields Form 1 ranitidine of the specified densities and that it involves a three- or four-carbon alcohol solvent : 2
Process for the production of a [ sic ] improved form of Form 1 Ranitidine_Hydrochloride having improved filtration and drying characteristics and having : *1325 ( i ) a bulk_density of not less than about 0.23 gm/ml ; and ( ii ) a tap_density of not less than about 0.28 gm/ml said process comprising adding Ranitidine_Hydrochloride to a substantially anhydrous hydroxylic solvent comprising at least one alkanol having 3-4 carbon atoms which has the characteristics that it dissolves Ranitidine_Hydrochloride and subsequently recovering the improved form of Form 1 Ranitidine_Hydrochloride

As originally filed the application for the ¡¬671_patent did not include the bulk and tap_density_limitations but simply claimed a process yielding `` an improved form of Form 1 Ranitidine_Hydrochloride ''
The bulk and tap_density_limitations defining the product were later added by amendment to overcome obviousness rejections over the original Glaxo patents disclosing Form 1 ranitidine

A divisional of the application also yielded United_States_Patent_No._5523,423 ( `` ¡¬423 '' )
The ¡¬423_patent included a product_claim directed to improved Form 1 ranitidine with the specified bulk and tap_density_limitations as well as product-by-process_claims essentially covering the products of the ¡¬ 671 process
However in litigation between TorPharm and several other pharmaceutical manufacturers in North Carolina the product_claim of the ¡¬ 423 patent was invalidated for lack of novelty by reason of a prior_sale of Form 1 ranitidine meeting the bulk and tap_density_limitations
Genpharm Inc. v. TorPharm_Inc. Nos._5 :97-CV-686-BO ( 3 ) -658-BO ( 2 ) -968-BO ( 3 ) ( E.D.N.C
Mar._8,_1999 ) ( Order granting summary_judgment of invalidity )
Evidence adduced during the North_Carolina_litigation revealed that in 1992 more than three years before the priority application for the ¡¬ 423 patent was filed Interchem Corporation sold three lots ( 290 kg in all ) of Form 1 ranitidine hydrochloride to Geneva Pharmaceuticals Inc
Id. slip op.at 5
Neither Interchem nor Geneva is related to TorPharm
Quality tests performed by Geneva showed that two of the three lots had bulk densities of more than 0.23 gm/ml and tap densities of more than 0.28 gm/ml
Accordingly the North Carolina district_court held that material meeting the limitations of the ¡¬423 product_claim had been on sale more than one year prior to filing of the patent application thereby invalidating the product_claim under 35 U.S.C.¡± 102 ( b )2 Id. slip op.at 8
However there was ( and still is ) no evidence of what process Interchem used to make its Form 1 ranitidine and by stipulation the product-by-process_claims of the ¡¬423_patent were not at issue in the North_Carolina_litigation
Id. slip op.at 2

TorPharm sued Ranbaxy for infringement of the ¡¬671 process patent in the United_States_District_Court for the District of New_Jersey
Ranbaxy moved for summary_judgment of invalidity arguing that `` under the principles of prosecution history estoppel and collateral_estoppel '' the ¡¬671_patent was invalid
Ranbaxy contended that because the ¡¬671_patent had been allowed `` based on a representation by TorPharm that the allowance of the ¡¬423_patent made the ¡¬671_patent allowable '' the subsequent invalidation of the ¡¬423_patent rendered the ¡¬671_patent invalid as well

The district_court initially denied Ranbaxy 's motion
TorPharm_Inc. v. Ranbaxy_Pharms. Inc. No._99-_CV-714 ( D.N.J
Aug._17,_2001 ) ( Order denying summary_judgment )
While acknowledging *1326 that TorPharm was estopped from re-litigating the validity of the ¡¬423_patent the district_court ruled that the patentability of the ¡¬671_process_claims was not legally linked to the patentability of the ¡¬423 product_claim
However in reaching this conclusion the district_court assumed that improved Form 1 ranitidine could still be nonobvious even if not novel by reason of a prior_sale
Because TorPharm had cited the nonobviousness of improved Form 1 ranitidine when arguing for the nonobviousness of the ¡¬671 process during prosecution the district_court reasoned that improved Form 1 ranitidine 's lack of novelty did not dictate obviousness of the ¡¬671_process_claims

Ranbaxy requested reconsideration of the district_court 's decision
Arguing that `` anticipation is the epitome of obviousness '' 3 Connell v. Sears Roebuck & Co. 722_F.2d_1542 1548 220_USPQ_193 198 ( Fed.Cir.1983 ) and noting that section 102 ( b ) is a source of prior art for a section 103 determination Ranbaxy suggested that `` there is error in the notion that an invention can be.. non-obvious if a patent claim embodying the invention had been invalidated by a Section 102 ( b ) prior_sale ''

While TorPharm 's response maintained that the patentability of the ¡¬671_process_claims was a distinct question from the patentability of the ¡¬423 product_claim given that the North_Carolina_decision had not addressed how Interchem 's ranitidine was produced the district_court was persuaded by Ranbaxy 's argument
Declaring that `` the distinction I made.. between.. nonobviousness on one hand and patentability on the other is a false distinction '' the court granted Ranbaxy 's motion for summary_judgment of invalidity
The court reasoned : `` [ I ] t is clear that the claims of the ¡¬671_patent would not have been allowed but for the alleged novelty of Form 1 ranitidine
Therefore TorPharm can not now argue that the nonobviousness of the ¡¬671_claims is supported by anything other than the novelty of [ improved ] Form 1 ranitidine ''
Given that the North_Carolina_decision had held improved Form 1 ranitidine to lack novelty under section 102 ( b ) the district_court concluded that collateral_estoppel precluded TorPharm from disputing the obviousness of the ¡¬671_claims
Accordingly the district_court reversed its initial decision and granted Ranbaxy summary_judgment that the ¡¬671_process_claims were invalid as obvious under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103

TorPharm appeals the judgment of invalidity
We exercise jurisdiction over TorPharm 's appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
