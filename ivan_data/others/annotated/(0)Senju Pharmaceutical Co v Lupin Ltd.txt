Synopsis
Background : Patentees brought action against competitor alleging infringement of a patent for an aqueous liquid pharmaceutical composition comprising gatifloxacin for topical ophthalmic administration
The United_States_District_Court for the District of Delaware Sue L. Robinson J. 836_F.Supp.2d_196 adjudged the claims infringed but invalid for obviousness
Patentees appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Plager Circuit_Judge held that :

District_Court properly considered evidence of unexpected_results and did not err in finding that based on record and testimony offered increase in corneal_permeability shown by patentees was not unexpected or surprising but was a product of routine optimization that would have been obvious to one of skill in the art and

District_Court properly applied presumption of validity considering both evidence of obviousness and evidence of unexpected_results to find that defendants set forth clear and convincing_evidence that patent was invalid for obviousness

Affirmed

Newman Circuit_Judge filed separate dissenting opinion

I
INTRODUCTION
The invention at issue relates to gatifloxacin an aqueous_liquid_pharmaceutical_eye_drop_composition with added disodium edetate ( `` EDTA '' )
Seven prior_art_patents are alleged as the basis for the obviousness determination each containing some of the same_chemistry as the claimed invention
In addition there are several prior patent infringement suits involving the same_chemistry and the same ¡¬045_patent ; these suits are relevant though to some extent the issues and parties vary
Three of these infringement suits including this one have all been tried before and decided by the same district judge in the District of Delaware

The underlying issues in this case-constructive infringement under Hatch-Waxman countered by alleged non-infringement and invalidity for obviousness-are familiar patent issues
Yet the combination of the chemistry and the prior litigation has produced here a complex of arguments by both parties
We address below in detail only those arguments that we believe have saliency with regard to the outcome

Regarding the prior law suits the first began in 2007
Pursuant to the Hatch-Waxman_Act a manufacturer of generic drugs Apotex_Inc. and Apotex Corp. ( `` Apotex '' ) filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application ( `` ANDA '' ) with the Food and Drug Administration ( `` FDA '' ) seeking to market generic versions of Allergan 's gatifloxacin product ZymarTHE_R
The patent on ZymarTHE_R was listed in the FDA 's record of Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic Equivalence what is known as the `` Orange Book ''

In this first suit the district_court in 2010 ruled that the asserted claims were infringed but that claims 1-BIG_TOKEN__3_and_6__BIG_TOKEN -9 were invalid as obvious over the prior_art
However the court found that defendant Apotex failed to demonstrate that claims 6_and_7 were invalid for lack of enablement and failed to demonstrate inequitable conduct
Senju_Pharm Co. v. Apotex_Inc. 717_F.Supp.2d_404 433 ( D.Del.2010 ) ( `` Apotex 1 `` )

Following a motion for a new trial or alternatively to amend judgment and findings regarding claim 7 the court reopened the case to consider additional evidence regarding claim 7
Thereafter the court in 2011 found claim 7 obvious by clear and convincing_evidence
Senju_Pharm Co. v. Apotex_Inc. 836_F.Supp.2d_196 210-11 ( D.Del.2011 ) ( `` Apotex 2 `` )
On appeal of the judgment regarding claim 7 this court affirmed the judgment of invalidity in a summary affirmance Senju_Pharm Co. v. Apotex_Inc. 485_Fed.Appx._433_(Fed.Cir.2012) ( `` Apotex I `` ) ; the other parts of the district judge 's rulings were not appealed

Meanwhile in February 2011 before final judgment was entered in that litigation the Senju plaintiffs petitioned the Patent and Trademark Office ( `` PTO '' ) for ex-parte re-examination of the ¡¬045_patent
Plaintiffs submitted the prior_art the arguments relied upon by the court and parties and the court 's opinion
However plaintiffs did not notify either the defendants or the court that they were seeking re-examination ; it was not until shortly *1340 before the re-examination was completed that the trial court was informed

On initial reexamination the PTO agreed with the district_court that the original claims would have been obvious in light of the cited prior_art_patents
Subsequently in October 2011 the PTO issued a reexamination certificate for the ¡¬045_patent which cancelled claims 1-BIG_TOKEN__3_and_8__BIG_TOKEN -11 allowed amended claim 6 and added claims 1216

Then plaintiff Senju filed another suit against Apotex alleging infringement of the reexamined_claims and seeking a declaratory_judgment of infringement based on the same ANDA filing at issue in the first litigation
Apotex responded to the new action by seeking dismissal on the grounds of res judicata or claim_preclusion ( `` claim '' here referring to the civil procedure concept not the patent law meaning )

Ultimately the district_court sided with Apotex and gave judgment against Senju on the grounds of claim_preclusion : `` the reexamination of the patent-at-issue did not create a new cause of action against the same previous defendants and accused product ''
Senju_Pharm Co. v. Apotex_Inc. 891_F.Supp.2d_656 662 ( D.Del.2012 ) ( `` Apotex 3 `` )
On appeal this judgment was upheld in an extensive opinion by the Federal_Circuit Senju_Pharm Co. v. Apotex_Inc. 746_F.3d_1344_(Fed.Cir.2014) ( `` Apotex II `` )

While all this was going on Senju in 2011 filed the suit at issue here against the Lupin and Hi-Tech_defendants asserting infringement under the Hatch-Waxman_Act of the ¡¬045_patent2 As in the second suit against Apotex Senju specifically alleged infringement of the reexamined_claims 6_and_12 -16 this time based on Lupin 's earlier-filed ANDA Nos._202-653 0.5 w/v %_gatifloxacin and 202-709 0.3 w/v %_gatifloxacin as well as Hi-Tech 's ANDA Nos._203189 0.5 w/v %_gatifloxacin and 203190 0.3 w/v %_gatifloxacin
The Lupin and Hi-Tech_defendants had sought FDA approval to market and sell generic copies of Senju 's FDA approved gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution

Lupin moved for judgment on the pleadings alleging that the narrower reexamined_claims of the ¡¬045_patent were invalid for obviousness and that plaintiffs should be collaterally estopped from relitigating these claims based on the court 's findings in Apotex 3
The district_court ruled that although Lupin might later at trial succeed in showing that the reexamined_claims were invalid for obviousness Senju in the Apotex 1 & 2 litigations had not fully litigated a claim with a limitation of 0.01 w/v % EDTA and therefore collateral estoppel would not apply.BIG_TOKEN__3_J.A._7__BIG_TOKEN

As noted earlier the ¡¬045_patent is directed to aqueous liquid pharmaceutical compositions comprising gatifloxacin and EDTA as well as various methods utilizing these compositions
The ¡¬045_patent 's original U.S. filing date is April_21,_2000
The reexamined_claims at issue are : 6
A method for raising corneal_permeability of an aqueous pharmaceutical Gatifloxacin eye drop solution comprising Gatifloxacin or its salt having a pH of from above 5 to about 6 containing from about 0.3 to about 0.8 w/v %_Gatifloxacin or its salt which comprises incorporating *BIG_TOKEN__1341_about_0__BIG_TOKEN01 w/v %_disodium_edetate into said Gatifloxacin eye drop solution
12
An aqueous_liquid_pharmaceutical_eye_drop_composition which comprises from about 0.3 to about 0.8 w/v %_Gatifloxacin or its salt about 0.01 w/v %_disodium_edetate and wherein the aqueous liquid pharmaceutical composition has a pH of from about 5 to about 6
13
The aqueous_liquid_pharmaceutical_eye_drop_composition according to claim 12 comprising about 0.3 w/v %_Gatifloxacin or its salt
14
The aqueous_liquid_pharmaceutical_eye_drop_composition according to claim 12 comprising about 0.5 w/v %_Gatifloxacin or its salt
15
The aqueous_liquid_pharmaceutical_eye_drop_composition according to claim 12 comprising at least one isotonic_agent selected from the group consisting of sodium_chloride potassium chloride glycerin mannitol and glucose
16
The aqueous_liquid_pharmaceutical_eye_drop_composition according to claim 14 wherein the at least one isotonic_agent is sodium_chloride
¡¬045_patent Reexamination Certificate 1:25-2:24 ; J.A
2702

The district_court having reserved the question of infringement and the validity of the reexamined_claims in light of the prior_art of record proceeded to trial
The court 's ultimate judgment was that the reexamined_claims were infringed but were invalid for obviousness
Thus the question before us is in this appeal is whether the district_court erred when in the current suit against Lupin and Hi-Tech it concluded that reexamined_claims 6_and_12 -16 of the ¡¬045_patent were invalid for obviousness
We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.¡±¡± 1292 ( c ) ( 2 ) and 1295 ( a )
