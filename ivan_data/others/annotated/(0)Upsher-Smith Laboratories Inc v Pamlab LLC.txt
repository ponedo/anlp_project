Opinion
RADER Circuit_Judge
Upsher-Smith Laboratories Inc. ( Upsher-Smith ) is the assignee of U.S. Patent Nos._5932,624 ( issued Aug._3,_1999 ) and 6,605,646 ( issued Aug._12,_2003 ) ( '624 and '646_patent s respectively ) for vitamin_supplement_compositions
Upsher-Smith asserted claims 1 2 5 and 8-10 of the '624_patent and claims 1-7 of the '646_patent against Pan_American_Laboratories L.L.C
and Pamlab L.L.C
( collectively Pamlab )1 In two orders the district_court granted summary judgment to Pamlab finding the asserted claims of the '624 and '646_patent s invalid for anticipation and obviousness

Labs Inc. No._01-352 2003_WL_22999551 ( D.Minn

Apr
26 2004 ) ( '646 Order ) ( invalidity of the asserted claims of the '646_patent )
Because the district_court properly found that a prior_art composition that `` optionally includes '' *1321 an ingredient anticipates a claim for the same composition that expressly excludes that ingredient this court affirms

I
The '624_patent discloses_vitamin_supplement_compositions to lower serum homocysteine levels and protect against related blood vessel disorders
'624_patent Abstract
The '646_patent discloses_vitamin_supplement_compositions to prevent brain and nervous system damage and pernicious anemia
'646_patent Abstract
Specifically the '624 and '646_patent s claim vitamin_supplement_compositions consisting of vitamin_B12 folic_acid ( folate ) and in some instances vitamin_B6
'624_patent col._2,_ll._15-19 ; '646_patent col. 2 II
25-29
Claim 1 of the '624_patent for instance states : A vitamin or supplement composition adapted for administration to a human the active components thereof consisting essentially of a member selected from the group consisting of : ( a ) folic_acid and vitamin_B12 ; ( b ) folic_acid vitamin_B12 and vitamin_B6 ; ( c ) folic_acid vitamin_B12 and a non-antioxidant vitamin ; and
( d ) folic_acid vitamin_B12 and non-antioxidant vitamins said composition being essentially free of anti [ ] oxidants
'624_patent col. 4 II
21-32
Importantly the asserted claims of the '624 and '646_patent s contain the requirement that the compositions be `` essentially free of antioxidants ''

The prior_art contains many vitamin_supplement_compositions comprising vitamin_B12 folate and vitamin_B6
However the prior_art that teaches compositions consisting of vitamin_B12 folate and vitamin_B6 also teaches adding other vitamins and antioxidants to provide additional health benefits
Dr. Victor Herbert the named inventor of the '624 and '646_patent s discovered that including antioxidants in such compositions destroys some of the vitamin_B12 and folate
Dr._Herbert obtained the '624 and '646_patent s based on that discovery
Dr._Herbert distinguished the prior_art by claiming compositions that expressly exclude antioxidants
Indeed Upsher-Smith admits that the only difference between the asserted claims and the prior_art is the claims ' negative limitation excluding antioxidants

In addition to teaching vitamin_supplement_compositions comprising vitamin_B12 folate and vitamin_B6 the prior_art recognized that several substances known to be antioxidants were also known to destroy vitamin_B12 and folate
Specifically an article published more than forty years before the filing dates of the '624 and '646_patent s recognized that vitamins C and E both of which were known antioxidants are `` incompatible '' with vitamin_B12
Thomas J. Macek & Beate A. Feller Crystalline Vitamin B12 in Pharmaceutical Preparations 41 Journal of the Am
Pharm
Assoc. No._6 at 285 ( 1952 )
Dr. Hebert also published an article more than twenty years before the filing the date of the '624 and '646_patent s teaching that vitamin C destroys vitamin_B12
Victor Herbert MD JD & Elizabeth Jacob MD Destruction of Vitamin B12 by Asorbic Acid 230 Journal of the Am
Med
Assoc. No._2 at 241 ( Oct._14,_1974 )
Thus the prior_art teaches that certain substances known as antioxidants destroy vitamin_B12
The prior_art does not teach however that the antioxidizing properties of those substances are responsible for this destruction
As described above Dr._Herbert discovered that relationship

Against this background the district_court decided Pamlab 's motions for summary *1322 judgment of invalidity for anticipation and obviousness
The district_court found the asserted claims of the '624 and '646_patent s anticipated by European Patent Application No._9331147623 ( filed Sept._14,_1993 ) ( European_Application )2 '624 Order at 11-12 ; '646 Order at 4-5
The European_Application discloses the same compositions claimed in the '624 and '646_patent s with the difference that the European_Application `` optionally includes '' antioxidants
The district_court found that because the European_Application teaches compositions both with and without the antioxidants it anticipates the asserted claims of the '624 and '646_patent s. '624 Order at 11 ; '646 Order at 4-5
Upsher-Smith appeals
This court has jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
