Opinion
GAJARSA Circuit_Judge
Appellant Rheox Inc. ( `` Rheox '' ) the plaintiff in this patent infringement case appeals from the district_court 's grant of summary_judgment for the appellees Entact Inc. ( `` Entact '' )
We affirm the district_court 's grant of summary_judgment of non-infringement because we conclude that Rheox is precluded from asserting that the claim_term `` calcium_orthophosphate '' covers monocalcium_orthophosphate and triple_superphosphate

BACKGROUND
Rheox is the assignee of U.S. Patent No._5162,600 ( `` the ¡¬600_patent `` )
The ¡¬600_patent is directed to an inexpensive_method of remediating lead from lead-contaminated soil by application of a composition primarily comprising `` calcium_orthophosphate ''
Claim construction of the term `` calcium_orthophosphate '' is the textual determinative issue in this case
Rheox asserts that the district_court incorrectly construed the claim_term `` calcium_orthophosphate '' to be limited to tricalcium_orthophosphate ( Ca3 ( PO4 ) 2 ) and improperly determined that Rheox disclaimed monocalcium_orthophosphate ( Ca ( H2PO4 ) 2H2O ) *1321 and triple_superphosphate ( `` TSP '' ) ( which the parties agree consists mostly of monocalcium_orthophosphate Ca ( H2PO4 ) 2 H2O ) from the scope of its claims

A phosphate is a chemical compound that contains phosphorous ( P ) and oxygen ( O )
An orthophosphate contains a PO43 anion.1 The parties agree and the district_court recognized that the terms `` phosphate '' and `` orthophosphate '' are used interchangeably in the art
Although in dispute it seems clear that a person of ordinary_skill in the relevant art would recognize that `` calcium_orthophosphate '' generally refers to a family of compounds each of which contains a calcium cation 2_Ca_2 - and a phosphate anion PO43-
Under this definition there are multiple calcium_orthophosphates including monocalcium_orthophosphate and tricalcium_orthophosphate

On December 28 1990 Rheox filed a patent_application which eventually issued as the ¡¬600_patent
The application as originally filed contained eighteen claims some using calcium_orthophosphate as the primary treating agent and others using monocalcium_orthophosphate and TSP_fertilizer
The relevant claims as originally filed with the Patent and Trademark Office ( `` PTO '' ) provided : 1
A method of treating lead contaminated soil to reduce the amount of mobile_lead contained in said soil the method which comprises : ( a ) providing an agent selected from the group consisting of calcium zinc magnesium or ammonium_phosphate_compounds calcium zinc magnesium or ammonium phosphite compounds and mixtures thereof ; and
( b ) contacting said agent with said soil to react said agent with mobile_lead contained in the soil and form immobilized water-insoluble_lead_compounds
2
The method of claim 1 wherein said agent comprises a calcium phosphate fertilizer selected from the group consisting of triple_superphosphate [ TSP ] and superphosphate
3
The method of claim 1 wherein said calcium magnesium zinc or ammonium_phosphate_compounds are selected from the group consisting of calcium_orthophosphate.. dicalcium_orthophosphate.. monocalcium_orthophosphate.. tricalcium diorthophosphate
... 18
A method of treating lead contaminated soil to reduce the amount of mobile_lead contained in said soil the method which comprises : ( a ) providing an agent selected from the group consisting of triple_superphosphate [ TSP ] phosphate rock hydroxyapatite and mixtures thereof ;.. ( emphasis added )

The written description of the ¡¬600_patent does not explicitly define calcium_orthophosphate
In both the summary of the invention and in the detailed description of the invention however the ¡¬600_patent provides that TSP is one of the preferred agents for use in the patented invention

*1322 In the first office action the PTO rejected all eighteen claims
The PTO first indicated that fertilizers ( TSP is a fertilizer ) are well known in the art and it would have been obvious to one of ordinary_skill to treat lead-contaminated soil with fertilizer
The PTO then rejected the claims as obvious over U.S. Patent No._4737,356 ( `` the O'Hara patent '' )3 which explains the use of phosphate to fix lead in particulate solids

Following Rheox 's submission of a supplemental Information Disclosure Statement the PTO issued a final_office_action rejecting each of Rheox 's 18 claims
The examiner explained that O'Hara taught use of water-soluble phosphate treatment agents
In the final rejection the examiner stated : It is also well known to one of ordinary_skill in the art that monocalcium_phosphate is water soluble and is routinely available as.. [ TSP ]..
The selection of water soluble_phosphates such as monocalcium_phosphate.. readily available as super phosphate and [ TSP ] and sold in bulk quantities as fertilizers as water soluble phosphate for use in the process of O'Hara_et_al would be obvious to one of ordinary_skill in the art

After the final_office_action issued Rheox 's attorneys met with the examiner for an interview
The examiner 's interview summary provides : `` [ Rheox 's ] [ a ] ttorney urge [ sic ] difference based on the use of slightly soluble_phosphates versus the soluble_phosphates of O'Hara.. Solubility data of instant compound and compounds of O'Hara to be provided ''

Rheox filed a response amending claim 1 by replacing the reference to calcium phosphate and other types of compounds with `` consisting essentially of calcium_orthophosphate ''
In its response Rheox also cancelled claim 2 which explicitly recited TSP and cancelled claim 3 which explicitly recited monocalcium_orthophosphate and tricalcium diorthophosphate.4 Also in original_claim 18 which is claim 8 of the ¡¬600_patent Rheox removed the reference to `` triple_superphosphate [ TSP ] ''

Rheox indicated that it made these cancellations and amendments to `` distinguish the invention from the water-soluble_compounds and method of treatment taught by O'Hara_et_al ''
O'Hara defines a water-soluble phosphate as a phosphate soluble in water at about 20¢X at least to the extent of five weight-volume percent i.e. 5g/100mL water
Rheox explained that `` a central difference between the invention and the prior art is that the presently claimed compound ( calcium_orthophosphate ) is substantially water-insoluble whereas the compounds utilized in the prior art processes are highly water-soluble ''
To support this contention Rheox provided the solubility of the claimed compound `` calcium_orthophosphate '' as 0.002g/100mL water
Notably the solubility of tricalcium_orthophosphate is 0.002g/100mL water
The solubility of TSP is 1.8g/100mL water
Rheox also asserted that the water-soluble_phosphates discussed by O'Hara `` are believed to be thousands of times more water-soluble than Applicants ' preferred ( and presently claimed ) calcium_orthophosphate material ''
In the prosecution_history Rheox further referred to `` calcium_orthophosphate '' with the chemical formula Ca3 ( PO4 ) 2 which is the chemical *1323 formula of tricalcium_orthophosphate.5 Rheox told the examiner that the amendments and cancellations were made `` to clarify the invention and to advance the patentability of the present application ''
The examiner allowed the application to issue on November 10 1992
The allowed final version of Claim 1 of the ¡¬600_patent covers :

1
A method of treating lead contaminated soil to reduce the amount of mobile_lead contained in said soil the method which comprises : ( a ) providing an agent consisting essentially of calcium_orthophosphate ; ( b ) contacting said agent with said soil to react said agent with mobile_lead contained in the soil and form immobilized water-insoluble_lead_compounds
¡¬600_patent col._7,_l._41 to col._8,_l._2
Rheox filed suit against Entact alleging that Entact infringed at least claim 1 of the ¡¬600_patent by using TSP_fertilizer to remediate lead-contaminated soil
It is undisputed that TSP is primarily monocalcium_orthophosphate
In fact the parties agree that if the claimed term `` calcium_orthophosphate '' does not include `` monocalcium_orthophosphate '' then Entact does not infringe the ¡¬ 600 patent
Entact filed counterclaims of invalidity unenforceability and antitrust violations
Entact also filed third party indemnification claims against RMT Inc

Entact filed a motion for summary_judgment based on non-infringement of the ¡¬ 600 patent
After reviewing the prosecution_history and construing the disputed limitations of the claim the district_court granted Entact 's motion for summary_judgment
Rheox Inc. v. Entact Inc. No._98-3731 slip
op.at 28 ( D.N.J
Aug._17,_2000 ) ( memorandum and order granting summary_judgment )

The court began by recognizing Rheox 's allegation that the ordinary meaning of calcium_orthophosphate is a family of compounds containing a `` Ca 2- `` cation and a `` PO43- `` anion including monocalcium_orthophosphate ( and thus TSP ) dicalcium_orthophosphate tricalcium_orthophosphate and hydroxyapatite
Id.at 13
The court stated that had the only evidence concerning the meaning of calcium_orthophosphate in the ¡¬600_patent come from treatises and dictionaries a deluge of which the parties cited it would have likely denied Entact 's motion for summary_judgment
Id.at 15

The district_court then considered the prosecution_history and determined that Rheox excluded monocalcium_orthophosphate and consequently TSP from the definition of calcium_orthophosphate in claim 1 of the ¡¬600_patent
Id
The court recognized that Rheox deleted all references in the claims to TSP and monocalcium_orthophosphate after the examiner rejected claims to these compounds
Id.at 16
The court cited the second ( final ) office action where the examiner indicated that monocalcium_orthophosphate which is routinely available as TSP is well known in the art as water-soluble and would have been obvious to use in the O'Hara process
Id
The court noted that Rheox responded by canceling original_claim 2 which had identified an agent comprising a calcium phosphate *1324 fertilizer selected from a group including TSP
Id.at 17
Rheox also amended original_claim 18 to delete the reference to TSP
Rheox stated that these changes were accomplished to distinguish the water-soluble_compounds and method of treatment taught by O'Hara as well as to clarify the invention and advance the `` patentability '' of its application
Consequently the court determined that `` [ t ] he simple chronology of the prosecution_history supports a conclusion that Rheox narrowed its claims to exclude TSP so that the patent_application would be approved ''
Id

The court rejected Rheox 's argument that excluding TSP from the construction of calcium_orthophosphate reads out the ¡¬600_patent 's preferred embodiment-TSP
Id.at 24-25
The court determined that the prosecution_history revealed that the claims were narrowed to exclude TSP and therefore inconsistencies in the written description were not controlling
Id
Examining the prosecution_history the court further determined that the term `` calcium_orthophosphate '' refers only to tricalcium_orthophosphate
Id.at 24

In sum the district_court found that Entact 's use of TSP does not infringe the ¡¬600_patent because `` calcium_orthophosphate '' in claim 1 does not include monocalcium_orthophosphate or TSP
It then found the claim_term `` calcium_orthophosphate '' limited to tricalcium_orthophosphate
Accordingly the court granted Entact 's motion for summary_judgment of non-infringement
On October 23 2000 the court entered final judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54 ( b ) on the issue of non-infringement noting that outstanding counterclaims and third-party claims remained
Rheox Inc. v. Entact Inc. No._98-3731 ( D.N.J
Oct._23,_2000 ) ( order granting partial final judgment )
Rheox filed a timely appeal with this court
We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( 1994 )
