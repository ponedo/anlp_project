HALLIBURTON COMPANY Plaintiff-Appellant v. SCHLUMBERGER TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION Defendant-Appellee
No._90-1191
| Feb._13,_1991
| Rehearing Denied March_15,_1991
Synopsis
Patentholder appealed from judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the Southern_District of Texas Sim Lake III J. 722_F.Supp._324 which held patents invalid
The Court of Appeals Rader Circuit_Judge held that failure to disclose cumulative references which were not more material than those which were cited to the examiner was not inequitable_conduct

Reversed

Opinion
*1437 RADER Circuit_Judge
Halliburton Company ( Halliburton ) sued Schlumberger Technology Corporation ( Schlumberger ) for infringement of U.S. Patent Nos._4388,529 ( '529_patent ) 4,409,481 ( '481_patent ) and 4,424,444 ( '444_patent )
These patents embrace tools and techniques for neutron logging of oil wells
Specifically the patents disclose use of high_energy_neutrons to measure the properties of underground geological formations

The United_States_District_Court for the Southern_District of Texas determined that Halliburton did not disclose important prior art to the Patent and Trademark Office ( PTO ) during the application process
Hence the district_court found Halliburton had engaged in inequitable_conduct
The district_court refused to enforce Halliburton 's patents and awarded Schlumberger $ 3,375,000.00 in attorney fees and expenses
See Halliburton Co. v. Schlumberger Technology Corp. 722_F.Supp._324 12_USPQ2d_1765_(S.D.Tex.1989)
Halliburton appeals from this judgment and order
This court reverses

BACKGROUND
Oil producers use well logging to detect oil in geological formations
This process involves lowering a complex instrument into a well borehole
As the logging tool moves down the borehole it measures or logs the properties of the surrounding geological formation

In neutron well logging the instrument emits high_energy_neutrons ( 14 million electron_volts ) as it descends into the borehole
The neutrons collide with the nuclei of atoms in the borehole and the surrounding earth
These collisions generate high-energy inelastic gamma rays
These collisions also quickly drain energy from the neutrons
As the neutrons slow down or moderate they become thermal_neutrons ( 0.025 electron_volts )
The nuclei of surrounding atoms capture these thermal_neutrons
When this capture or neutron decay occurs the capturing atoms emit capture_gamma_rays

The logging tool detects these capture_gamma_rays
A count of capture_gamma_rays reveals the neutron population and the rate of neutron decay
Different materials capture neutrons at different rates
Thus measuring the decay of thermal_neutrons tells much about the composition of formations around the borehole
Oil for instance captures thermal_neutrons at a different rate than saltwater
