Opinion
PAULINE NEWMAN Circuit_Judge
The initial opinion in this appeal reported at Elan Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Mayo_Foundation 304_F.3d_1221 64_USPQ2d_1292_(Fed.Cir.2002) has been vacated 314_F.3d_1299_(Fed.Cir.2002) ( en banc ) and is replaced with this opinion and decision

The United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of California granting the Mayo_Foundation 's motion for summary_judgment of patent invalidity held that Elan 's two patents in suit United_States_Patent_No._5612,486 ( the ¡¬486_patent ) for `` Transgenic Animals Harboring APP Allele Having Swedish_Mutation '' and Patent No._5850,003 ( the ¡¬003_patent ) for `` Transgenic Rodents Harboring APP Allele Having Swedish_Mutation '' are invalid on the ground of anticipation by United_States_Patent_No._5455,169 entitled `` Nucleic Acids for Diagnosing and Modeling Alzheimer 's Disease '' ( the Mullan_reference )1

In response to the questions raised in the petitions for reconsideration we clarify that invalidity based on anticipation requires that the assertedly anticipating disclosure enabled the subject matter of the reference and thus of the patented invention without undue experimentation
Applying this rule we remand for determination of whether the Mullan_reference was an enabling disclosure
The summary_judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings

BACKGROUND
At the time of the Elan invention it was known that the brains of people with Alzheimer 's disease contain abnormal tangles and deposits of plaques and that a principal component of the plaques is a protein fragment called beta-amyloid peptide or betaAP ( also designated aAP and Aa )
The formation of betaAP in brain tissue is *1053 believed to induce or foster formation of Alzheimer 's disease plaques

It is believed that a mechanism by which betaAP is formed is the abnormal_cleavage of a protein produced in brain cells called the amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) ; and that this abnormal_cleavage occurs when an enzyme produced in the brain called beta-secretase cleaves the APP molecule between amino_acids 596_and_597 ; and a second enzyme produced in the brain called gamma-secretase releases the betaAP fragment from a portion of the cleaved APP
The mechanism is illustrated in the Elan brief as follows :

?
Humans who do not develop Alzheimer 's disease are believed to break down the APP in a manner that does not form significant amounts of betaAP in the brain

The Swedish_mutation is an abnormal gene2 that was discovered on chromosome 21 in a Swedish family that has an unusually high incidence of early-onset Alzheimer 's disease
This mutation is described in the Mullan patent as a variation in the DNA nucleotides that encode codons 670_and_6713 wherein lysine and methionine the amino_acids normally encoded at these positions are replaced with asparagine and leucine

The Elan_patents are directed to transgenic_rodents whose genetic makeup has been modified to include the Swedish_mutation
Claim 1 of the ¡¬486_patent is representative : 1
A transgenic_rodent_comprising
a diploid genome comprising a transgene encoding a heterologous_APP_polypeptide having the Swedish_mutation wherein the amino_acid residues at positions corresponding to positions 595_and_596 in human_APP695 are asparagine and leucine respectively wherein the transgene is expressed to produce a human_APP_polypeptide having the Swedish_mutation and wherein said polypeptide is processed to ATF-betaAPP in a sufficient_amount to be detectable in a brain_homogenate of said transgenic_rodent
Dependent claims add the limitations that the rodent is murine ( mouse ) and that the transgene is nonhomologously integrated

The claims of the ¡¬003_patent differ only in that they include a promoter and a polyadenylation site
Claim 1 is representative : 1
A transgenic_rodent_comprising
*1054 a diploid genome comprising a transgene comprising in operable linkage a promoter a DNA segment encoding a heterologous_APP_polypeptide and a polyadenlyation site wherein the APP polypeptide has the Swedish_mutation whereby the amino_acid residues at positions corresponding to positions 595_and_596 in human_APP695 are asparagine and leucine respectively wherein the transgene is expressed to produce a human_APP_polypeptide having the Swedish_mutation and wherein said polypeptide is processed to ATF-betaAPP in a sufficient_amount to be detectable in a brain_homogenate of said transgenic_rodent
The Mullan_reference was cited as prior art in prosecution of the Elan_patents and was distinguished upon amendment of the Elan claims to include the claim clause that refers to production of ATF-betaAPP in detectable amounts in the rodent brain
