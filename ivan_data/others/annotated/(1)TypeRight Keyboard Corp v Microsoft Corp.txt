We dismiss the cross-appeal for lack of jurisdiction reverse the summary_judgment of invalidity and remand for further proceedings

BACKGROUND
TypeRight is the owner of the ¡¬441 and ¡¬484_patent s which generally describe ergonomic_keyboards featuring v-shaped designs with separate_right-and left-hand_key_clusters ; keys arranged in a QWERTY_configuration ; 1 and a wrist rest
The ¡¬441 and ¡¬484_patent s are both continuations of United States Application No._990021 filed December 14 1992 which is itself a continuation-in-part of an earlier application filed on February 21 1991
The parties appear to assume that the ¡¬441 and ¡¬484_patent s claim priority to February 21 1991 and that February 21 1990 is the critical_date for the patents in suit

On July_23,_1998 TypeRight filed a complaint against Microsoft alleging that Microsoft 's line of ergonomic_keyboards infringed several of TypeRight 's patents including the ¡¬441 and ¡¬484_patent s. Microsoft responded by asserting affirmative defenses and counterclaims for non-infringement invalidity and unenforceability
Following the district_court 's Markman order construing the claims TypeRight amended its complaint to assert infringement of only claims 11_and_12 of the ¡¬441_patent and claims 1-11 of the ¡¬484_patent

On August 31 1999 Microsoft filed motions for summary_judgment of non-infringement and invalidity
In regard to invalidity Microsoft argued that all of the asserted claims were obvious in light of the prior_art relying primarily on a one-page document ( `` the Marquardt_document '' ) created by the German company Marquardt GmbH ( `` Marquardt '' )
Microsoft additionally relied on a prior_art keyboard and a book Keyboard RSI : The Practical Solution by Barbara Stack ( the `` Stack reference '' ) which taught that v-shaped keyboards `` are.. ergonomically acceptable provided they are used.. in conjunction with a properly designed attached wrist support '' to show that the asserted claims were obvious
( J.A.at 3553 )

The Marquardt_document features several unlabeled pictures of v-shaped keyboards with separate_right and left-hand_key_clusters in the German equivalent of a QWERTY_configuration
It is a single page in length and is not dated
TypeRight *1155 claims to have first learned of the document 's existence during depositions conducted by Microsoft in Germany

Because the Marquardt_document was undated Microsoft sought to prove that it was prior_art under 35 U.S.C.¡± 102 ( b ) i.e. that it was publicly accessible prior to February 21 1990
For this purpose Microsoft offered fact testimony of several consultants who were paid for the time they spent testifying
The first was Dr._Cakir who testified that he found the Marquardt_document in his `` files from the year 1990 '' but remembered receiving the document at a trade_show in Germany he attended in 1986
( J.A.at 700 )
Another of Microsoft 's consultants Dr. Hirsch testified that he attended the same 1986 trade_show and remembered that photographs similar to the Marquardt_document were being distributed to the attendees
Additionally Microsoft relied on a 1986 report prepared by the Fraunhofer Institute for Industrial Science and Organization ( `` the Fraunhofer_report '' ) for Marquardt
Although Microsoft did not introduce a translated copy of the Fraunhofer_report it argued that the pictures contained therein displaying v-shaped keyboards similar to those shown in the Marquardt_document corroborated Mr. Cakir 's testimony
Dr. Ilg who prepared the Fraunhofer_report testified that the report featured pictures of wooden prototypes of the Marquardt keyboards and that these prototypes were displayed at the 1986 trade_show where Dr._Cakir allegedly acquired a publicly distributed copy of the Marquardt_document
None of Microsoft 's experts was a current or former employee of Marquardt and no evidence obtained from Marquardt itself was offered to prove a publication date for the Marquardt_document

TypeRight responded to Microsoft 's motion for summary_judgment arguing inter alia ( 1 ) that the testimony of Dr._Cakir as to the date of the Marquardt_document was not sufficiently corroborated by the testimony of Microsoft 's other witnesses and the Fraunhofer_report ; ( 2 ) that the testimony of Microsoft 's witnesses as to the date of the document was not credible ; and ( 3 ) that there was no suggestion to combine the alleged prior_art.2 The district_court rejected these arguments and orally granted Microsoft 's motion for summary_judgment of invalidity on June_19,_2000
The court declined to rule on Microsoft 's motion for summary_judgment of non-infringement and denied the motion for summary_judgment of inequitable_conduct

Final judgment was entered June_22,_2000
On July_6,_2000 Microsoft filed an application pursuant to Federal_Rule of Civil_Procedure 60 ( b ) ( 1 ) seeking to vacate the entry of final judgment because as it argued its counterclaims for non-infringement and inequitable_conduct remained pending
On July_25,_2000 the district_court granted Microsoft 's Rule 60 ( b ) application and vacated the final judgment.3 Subsequently Microsoft filed a renewed motion for summary_judgment of non-infringement that the court denied on March_28,_2002

Mar._28,_2002 )
On November *1156 19 2001 TypeRight filed a motion for reconsideration of the summary_judgment of invalidity arguing amongst other things that the district_court failed to make sufficient findings to show obviousness under the Graham factors
The district_court granted this motion in part `` for the limited purpose of making.. supplemental Graham findings '' related to a motivation to combine and affirmed the earlier grant of summary_judgment of invalidity
TypeRight_Keyboard_Corp. v. Microsoft_Corp. No._98- CV-1358-IEG slip op.at 27 ( S.D.Cal
July_2,_2002 )
On November 19 2002 the court certified the decision on invalidity pursuant to Federal_Rule of Civil_Procedure 54 ( b ) and dismissed without prejudice Microsoft 's counterclaims for inequitable_conduct and non-infringement
TypeRight_Keyboard_Corp. v. Microsoft_Corp. No._98- 1358-IEG ( S.D.Cal
Nov._19,_2002 )

TypeRight timely appealed the judgment of invalidity and Microsoft_cross-appealed from the district_court 's dismissal of its counterclaim for non-infringement
The inequitable_conduct issue has not been raised on appeal and the only ground for invalidity before this court is obviousness
Prior to argument TypeRight moved to dismiss the cross-appeal for lack of jurisdiction
This motion was denied by order on April_30,_2003
