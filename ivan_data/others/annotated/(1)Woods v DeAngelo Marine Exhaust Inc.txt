I
BACKGROUND
A
The Patents in Suit
Water jacketed marine_exhaust_systems cool exhaust as it exits the engine of a marine vessel
These devices generally consist of two metal cylinders with exhaust flowing through the inner cylinder and water flowing through the space between the inner and outer_cylinders
The patents in suit are directed to an apparatus that more efficiently cools exhaust by tapering the tail_end of the outer liner so it directs the cooling water into the exhaust stream and prevents water migration and corrosion by tapering the tail_end of the inner_liner to reduce the turbulence at the end of the pipe

Woods filed U.S. Patent Application No._08 /419,097 ( `` ¡¬097_Application '' ) on April_10,_1995
The ¡¬097_Application disclosed and claimed : ( 1 ) a water jacketed exhaust system with an elongated tapered inner_liner and outer_shell ; ( 2 ) a spacer separating the liner and shell ; and ( 3 ) the inner and outer tapered surfaces acting as a clip for turbulence and a deflection surface respectively
*1276 See e.g. ¡¬097_Application_claim 1
On December 29 1995 Woods filed U.S. Patent Application No._08 /580,548 ( `` ¡¬548_Application '' ) as a continuation-in-part ( `` CIP '' ) of the ¡¬097_Application
The ¡¬ 548 Application 's claims were broader than the ¡¬097_Application 's claims
For example claim 1 of the ¡¬548_Application required extension of the inner_liner beyond the outer_shell but did not limit the tapered surfaces to deflecting water and clipping turbulence
Compare ¡¬097_Application_claim 1 with ¡¬548_Application claim 1

On July_1,_1996 an examiner rejected all claims of the ¡¬097_Application as anticipated by U.S
Patents_No._5212,949 ( `` Shiozawa '' ) and No._799013 ( `` Moffitt '' )
Instead of responding to the ¡¬097 anticipation rejection Woods allowed the ¡¬097_Application to go abandoned and continued to prosecute the CIP ¡¬548_Application
On April_25,_1997 the same examiner who had rejected the ¡¬097_Application allowed several of the claims in the ¡¬548_Application
On April_21,_1998 the ¡¬548_Application issued as the ¡¬670_Patent

On December 15 1997 before the ¡¬548_Application had matured into the ¡¬670_Patent Woods filed CIP application No._08 /990,821 ( `` ¡¬821_Application '' )
The invention claimed in the ¡¬821_Application was similar to that of the ¡¬548_Application but was not limited to an elongated inner_liner extending beyond the outer_shell
On April_1,_1999 the examiner rejected claims 1-4 6 and 8-21 of the ¡¬821_Application as anticipated by U.S. Patent No._4977,741 ( `` Lulloff '' )
Woods amended the claims by reciting a spacer between the inner and outer_cylinders that created a back pressure so that water forcefully sprayed out of a spray ring
Woods argued that Lulloff did not contain this limitation and that the amended claims were not anticipated
Woods never argued that the claims were or were not patentable as initially written
The examiner allowed the amended claims and the ¡¬821_Application issued as the ¡¬ 633 Patent on March_14,_2000
Woods exclusively licensed both the ¡¬670 and ¡¬633_Patent s to MES
