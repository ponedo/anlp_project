Synopsis
Background : Patent holder brought infringement action after generic drug manufacturers filed Abbreviated_New_Drug_Application ( ANDA ) to manufacture patented drug
The United_States_District_Court for the Southern_District of Indiana Richard L. Young J. 364_F.Supp.2d_820 granted judgment for patent holder
Defendants appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Rader Circuit_Judge held that :

prior_article that identified compounds from same_family of compounds as subsequently patented drug did not anticipate that drug ;

claims in subsequently patented drug were not obvious based upon prior_art compound ;

patentee overcame any prima facie case of obviousness ;

patentee 's clinical trials of claimed invention were experimental use that negated any public use bar ; and

patent could not be invalidated on basis of inequitable_conduct

Before discovery of olanzapine Lilly discovered other drugs in the same_family of compounds ( thienobenzodiazepines ) namely clozapine flumezapine ethyl flumezapine and ethyl olanzapine ( a.k.a
Compound ¡¬222 )
Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law 364 F.Supp.2d at 831-33
These compounds share a common structural nucleus as thienobenzodiazepines namely a piperazine_ring ( R ) a benzene_ring ( R1 ) and a thiophene_ring ( R2 )

?
Lilly used clozapine to treat some forms of schizophrenia in the late ¡¬ 60s and early ¡¬70s
Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law 364 F.Supp.2d at 831
Clozapine was thus the first `` atypical '' antipsychotic drug
Structurally olanzapine differs from clozapine in that olanzapine has a methyl-substituted thiophene_ring in place of the benzene_ring in clozapine
Id.at 846-47
Olanzapine also has hydrogen in place of the chlorine on its benzene_ring
Id.at 847
Despite its advantages researchers discovered in 1975 that clozapine caused an often fatal blood disorder ( agranulocytosis ) in one percent of patients
For that reason Lilly withdrew clozapine from the market
Id
Nevertheless after a general failure to replace clozapine reflected by many documented reports of promising compounds that failed either for lack of efficacy or toxic side-effects the FDA in late 1989 approved clozapine with careful blood-monitoring
Id.at 832

Until discovery of olanzapine researchers attributed the efficacy of clozapine and typical antipsychotics to their `` neuroleptic substituent '' -an electron-withdrawing group considered important to the antipsychotic activity of the compounds
Id
Halogen-a fluorine ( F ) or chlorine ( Cl ) atom-is such an electron withdrawing group
Id.at 832 850

Olanzapine does not have a halogen atom i.e
a fluorine ( F ) or chlorine ( Cl ) atom
Instead it has a hydrogen_atom ( H ) which is not an electron withdrawing ( or electronegative ) group
Id.at 850

?
*1375 The prior_art to olanzapine includes ethyl flumezapine and flumezapine both disclosed in U.S. Patent No._4115,574 ( ¡¬574_patent ) that issued in 1978
The prior_art also includes ethyl olanzapine ( a.k.a
Compound ¡¬222 )
Ethyl flumezapine caused widespread blood problems in dogs
Id.at 847
Flumezapine caused extra-pyramidal symptoms ( EPS ) and an increase in liver enzymes and a muscle enzyme called creatine phosphokinase ( CPK )
Ethyl olanzapine caused a significant increase in cholesterol in female beagle dogs
Id
Thus the prior_art to olanzapine had significant detrimental side effects

Olanzapine differs structurally from flumezapine by substitution of a hydrogen_atom ( H ) for the fluorine_atom ( F ) in flumezapine at the 7-position of the benzene_ring
Id

?
Olanzapine differs structurally from ethyl flumezapine by replacement of the fluorine_atom ( F ) and ethyl group ( CH2CH3 ) in ethyl flumezapine with a hydrogen_atom ( H ) and methyl_group ( CH3 ) respectively
Id

?
Olanzapine differs structurally from its ethyl analog Compound ¡¬222 ( ethyl olanzapine ) by replacement of the ethyl group ( CH2CH3 ) with a methyl_group ( CH3 ) at the 2-position of the thiophene_ring
Id

The trial_court found that the defendants did not prove by clear and convincing evidence that claims 1 2 3 7 8 and 15 of the ¡¬382_patent were invalid as anticipated under 35 U.S.C.¡± 102
Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law 364 F.Supp.2d at 922-23
The primary reference the defendants cited for anticipation of these claims is an article entitled `` 4-Piperazinyl-10H-thieno [ 2,3-b ] [ 1,5 ] benzodiazepines as Potential_Neuroleptics '' from the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry in 1980 ( Chakrabarti 1980a )

Anticipation is a question of fact including whether or not an element is inherent in the prior_art
See In re Schreiber 128_F.3d_1473 1477 ( Fed.Cir.1997 )
Therefore this court reviews a finding of anticipation under the clearly erroneous standard
Atlas Powder Co. v. Ireco Inc. 190_F.3d_1342 1346 ( Fed.Cir.1999 )
To anticipate a prior_art_reference must place the inventive compound or composition in the possession of the public
In re Brown 51_C.C.P.A._1254 329_F.2d_1006 1011 ( 1964 )
Thus the prior_art_reference must disclose each and every feature of the claimed invention either explicitly or inherently
Glaxo Inc. v. Novopharm *1376 Ltd. 52_F.3d_1043 1047 ( Fed.Cir.1995 )

Pointing to In re Petering 49_C.C.P.A._993 301_F.2d_676_(1962) and In re Schaumann 572_F.2d_312_(C.C.P.A.1987) IVAX asserts that Chakrabarti 1980a anticipated claim 1 of the ¡¬382_patent because it identified compounds from the same_family of compounds ( thienobenzodiazepines )
Indeed in Petering the Board of Patent Appeals affirmed the examiner 's rejection of claims 1 2 4 5 7 and 10-12 of the patent applicant 's application on `` isoalloxazines ''
301 F.2d at 677
However in contrast to this case the prior_art in Petering did more than make a broad generic disclosure
In Petering the prior_art disclosed a limited_number of specific preferences from a specifically defined group of isoalloxazines
Id
As a result Petering actually disclosed to one skilled in the art a limited_class of only `` some 20 compounds '' including `` 6 7-dimethyl-9- ( Bmonohydroxyethyl ) -isoalloxazine ''
Schaumann 572 F.2d at 315 ( citing Petering 301 F.2d at 682 )

Similarly the prior_art in Schaumann disclosed 14 compounds later further narrowed to 7 considering express preferences
Additionally the structural formula of this prior_art contained but a single variable
572 F.2d at 314
Thus in Schaumann the prior_art patent embraced a very limited_number of closely related compounds and specifically described the claimed compound
572 F.2d at 316
Thus unlike this case the prior_art in both Petering and Schaumann expressly spelled out a definite and limited_class of compounds that enabled a person of ordinary skill in the art to at once envisage each member of this limited_class
Schaumann 572 F.2d at 315 ; Petering 301 F.2d at 681-82

By contrast the number of compounds actually disclosed by Chakrabarti 1980a numbers in the millions ( including all proposed alternative substituents )
Chakrabarti 1980a examined forty-five specific compounds ( as opposed to a genus of compounds ) in the 4-piperazinyl-10H-thieno [ 2,3-b ] [ 1,5 ] benzodiazepine family and fourteen analogous 5-piperazinyl-substituted 4H-thieno [ 2,3-b ] [ 1,4 ] benzodiazepines which were created to compare activity
Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law 364 F.Supp.2d at 848
Indeed Chakrabarti 1980a listed several preferred compounds and substituents none of which resemble olanzapine : for R-a methyl hydroxyethyl or hydroxypropyl ; for R1-a fluorine chlorine or 7 8 di-fluoro [ no hydrogen ] ; and
for R2-a methyl 2-ethyl or 2-isopropyl group
Id.at 848
Five of the preferred individual compounds ( 9 12 17 29 and 34 ) are more potent than clozapine ( scoring a 3 CAR1 or higher ) and have clozapine-like effect
For those five preferred compounds the Chakrabarti 1980a authors expressed a preference for specific complete_compounds without any variation of the individual_substituents on those molecules
Chakrabarti 1980a also always expressed a preference for halogen-containing compounds ( fluorine or chlorine ) not hydrogen
Id.at 832-33
Furthermore compounds 9 12 17 and 29 all have fluorine at the 7-position of the benzene_ring
And though Compound 34 does have hydrogen at the 7-position of the benzene_ring it *1377 has a hydroxyethyl on its piperazine_ring unlike olanzapine
Id
In sum Chakrabarti 1980a discloses nothing close to the claimed invention

Chakrabarti 1980a does provide a general structural formula with possible substituents of `` R '' `` R1 '' and `` R2 '' but it does not define them at all
Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law 364 F.Supp.2d at 900
No possible combination of those preferred substituents would lead to the components that make up olanzapine because each would contain a fluorine or a chlorine
To make olanzapine from Chakrabarti 1980a one would have to depart from the teaching of the article and recombine the components of the specific illustrative compounds with hindsight
Thus Chakrabarti 1980a does not anticipate because : ( 1 ) the article prefers complete_compounds not individual_substituents ( 2 ) the article discloses no generic disclosure encompassing olanzapine or even stating that substituents on different compounds were interchangeable and ( 3 ) the article does not suggest transforming unpreferred compound 72 into a preferred compound
Thus Chakrabarti 1980a did not place olanzapine in the possession of the public
Therefore this court detects no clear error in the trial_court 's finding of no anticipation
