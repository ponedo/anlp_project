United States Court of Appeals Federal Circuit
STRATTEC SECURITY CORPORATION Plaintiff-Appellee v. GENERAL AUTOMOTIVE SPECIALTY COMPANY INC. and All-Lock_Company Inc. Defendants-Appellants
No._96-1024
| Sept._16,_1997
Synopsis
Patentee brought action against competitor alleging that its patent for resistor_assembly was infringed by the competitor 's Vehicle Anti-Theft System ( VATS ) keys
The United States District Court for the Southern_District of Texas Lynn N. Hughes J. entered judgment in favor of patentee and awarded patentee attorney fees
Competitor appealed
The Court of Appeals Rich Circuit_Judge held that : ( 1 ) patent was not literally infringed ; ( 2 ) patent was not infringed under doctrine of equivalents ; and ( 3 ) case was not exceptional as required to support attorney fee award

BACKGROUND
In 1978 General Motors Corporation ( GM ) asked the Allen-Bradley Company ( A-B ) to make a commercially manufacturable pellet resistor for mounting in the shank or long portion of the ignition keys to cars equipped with GM 's Vehicle Anti-Theft System ( VATS )1 The VATS_keys are designed so that a resistor mounted in the shank of the key will operatively engage an electrical_circuit when the key is inserted into a car 's VATS-equipped ignition system
The electrical_circuit includes an on-board computer that temporarily disables the car 's electronic ignition system if the resistance value of the key 's resistor does not match a predetermined value

In response to GM 's request A-B developed and patented a packaged resistor
A-B 's patent the '482_patent issued 10_February_1981 and is the subject of this lawsuit
Although originally assigned to A-B the patent was assigned to plaintiff-appellee Strattec on 27_February_1995
Strattec is the original equipment supplier of the GM VATS_keys currently used in GM cars

While Strattec 's VATS_keys do incorporate a pellet resistor like that covered by the '482_patent the patent itself is not directed to keys VATS or otherwise and does not include the words `` key '' `` ignition cylinder '' `` vehicle '' `` car '' `` automobile '' `` steering column '' or `` vehicle anti-theft system ''
The '482_patent is directed to a resistor_assembly
According to the '482_patent 's Summary of Invention the assembly comprises an electronic_chip encapsulated in a small package with runner-like leads ( e.g. small enough to fit inside a standard GM ignition key )
Figure 3b from the '482_patent illustrates the preferred_embodiment and is provided below

In the preferred_embodiment a sheet metal lead frame 16 ( e.g. a perforated ribbon ) has internal termination pads 14_and_14 ' formed by a punching or stamping operation
An electronic_chip 13 such as a chip resistor or integrated circuit is soldered to the termination pads 14_and_14 '
This assembly is then over-molded with plastic 11 to produce the packaged component as depicted in Fig.3d from the patent
The packaged component is subsequently separated from the sheet of metal and the exterior runner-like leads 12_and_12 ' are simultaneously shaped by a trimming operation to produce the finished encapsulated component 10 shown in figures 1_and_2 of the patent

*1414. ?
The lead frame 16 thus conducts electricity supports the electronic_chip 13 and forms runner-like leads 12_and_12 '
As used in Strattec 's VATS key the encapsulated chip is inserted in a key shank and mounted in a defined orientation so that a runner-like lead protrudes on each side of the shank

Strattec filed this lawsuit on 6_April_1995 against General_Automotive which had just introduced its own after-market VATS key designed to work in GM 's VATS-equipped cars
General_Automotive has been in the business of after-market supply of replacement products such as switches and locks for many years
The product Strattec accuses of infringing the '482_patent is General_Automotive 's complete VATS key ( as shown below ) which includes a metal key blank a resistor_assembly and an over-molded plastic cover enclosing the head and part of the shank of the key blank as well as the entire resistor_assembly except for the contact areas

The resistor_assembly ( shown below ) comprises a molded plastic contact carrier a cylindrical resistor with axial leads and two contacts formed of bent round wire
The contact carrier holds the resistor and its leads in their respective positions
Each of the resistor leads is then wrapped around and soldered to an end of its respective contact wire
