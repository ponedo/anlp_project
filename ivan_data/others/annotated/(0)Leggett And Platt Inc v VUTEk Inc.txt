United States Court of Appeals Federal Circuit
LEGGETT & PLATT INCORPORATED and L & P Property Management Company Plaintiffs-Appellants v. VUTEk INC. Defendant-Appellee
No._2007-1515
| Aug._21,_2008
| Rehearing Denied Sept._26,_2008
Synopsis
Background : Patent owner sued competitor alleging infringement of patent that consisted of methods and apparatus for jetting freezing and substantially curing UV-curable inks onto substrate without deforming substrate
Competitor counterclaimed for declaratory judgments of noninfringement and invalidity
The United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Missouri Catherine D. Perry J. 2006_WL_3813677 granted summary_judgment of invalidity
Owner appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Prost Circuit_Judge held that :

prior art patent that may not have expressly disclosed that light emitting diodes ( LEDs ) cured ink to great_extent nevertheless inherently disclosed LEDs that were `` effective to '' do so and

question of whether reference taught away from patented invention was inapplicable to anticipation analysis

Affirmed

Opinion
PROST Circuit_Judge
Plaintiffs-Appellants Leggett & Platt Inc. and L & P Property Management Co. ( collectively `` L & P '' ) sued Defendant-Appellee VUTEk Inc. ( `` VUTEk '' ) alleging that certain of VUTEk 's large-scale printers infringe claims 1-3 7 9-10 and 19 of L & P 's U.S._Patent_No._6755,518 ( the `` ¡¬518_patent `` )
VUTEk filed a motion for summary_judgment alleging that the asserted claims of the ¡¬518_patent are invalid
The district_court granted VUTEk 's motion finding claims 1 9 10 and 19 of the ¡¬518_patent to be anticipated by a prior VUTEk patent and claims 2 3 and 7 to be obvious in light of a combination of two prior VUTEk patents
Leggett & Platt Inc. v. VUTEk Inc. No._4 :05-CV-788 2006_WL_3813677 ( E.D.Miss
Dec. 26 2006 ) ( `` Summary_Judgment_Order '' )
Because we conclude that the district_court properly granted summary_judgment of invalidity we affirm

I
The ¡¬518_patent entitled `` Method and Apparatus for Ink Jet Printing on Rigid Panels '' describes a method and apparatus for printing ink on a rigid deformable_substrate without causing the substrate to deform even temporarily
A deformable_substrate is a material that has a tendency to bend ripple warp or otherwise deform when it is exposed to radiant energy such as heat or infrared ( `` IR '' ) radiation
To print on such a substrate the ¡¬518_patent describes the use of a `` UV curable '' ink-which can be cured ( i.e. dried ) by exposure to ultraviolet ( `` UV '' ) radiation-and a *1351 `` cold_UV '' radiation_source
Where some `` hot '' sources of UV radiation will emit non-UV radiation that can heat and deform the substrate a `` cold_UV '' radiation_source can substantially cure the ink without deforming the substrate
The ¡¬518_patent also teaches that shortly after the UV_curable_ink is deposited on the substrate the cold_UV radiation_source `` freezes '' the ink in place to prevent the ink from spreading wicking or otherwise moving on the substrate
Because the height of the substrate may vary the ¡¬518_patent also provides techniques for maintaining a constant distance between the ink_jet 's printheads and the substrate

In May 2005 L & P filed suit in the United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Missouri alleging that VUTEk 's PressVu UV printers infringe L & P 's ¡¬518_patent
Specifically L & P alleged that VUTEk was infringing independent claims 1_and_10 and dependent claims 2 3 7 9 and 19 of the ¡¬518_patent
Independent claim 1 is representative of these claims for the purposes of this appeal
It recites : A method of ink_jet printing UV_curable_ink from an ink_jet printhead onto a rigid substrate formed of a material that has a tendency to at least temporarily deform in the direction of printhead if exposed to radiant curing energy while at a printing_station the method comprising : moving a printhead carriage having an ink_jet printhead thereon approximately parallel to a substrate at a printing_station ; jetting ink from the head onto the surface of a substrate ; providing at least one cold_UV curing assembly on the carriage adjacent to and moveable with the printhead and oriented to direct UV energy onto the surface of the substrate at the printing_station sufficiently close to where ink is being jetted onto the surface to freeze dots of the jetted_ink on the surface ; and
the cold_UV assembly being effective to impinge sufficient UV light on the ink to substantially cure the ink without impinging radiation that would heat the substrate so as to deform it even temporarily while at the printing_station
¡¬518_patent col.9 ll.6-25 ( emphases added )

The district_court held a Markman hearing in April 2006 and subsequently issued an order construing the disputed terms and phrases of the ¡¬518_patent
Leggett & Platt Inc. v. Vutek Inc. No._4 :05-CV-788 2006_WL_1479537_(E.D.Miss._May_25,_2006) ( `` Markman Order '' )
Three of these claim constructions are at issue on appeal : ( 1 ) cold_UV ( 2 ) freeze dots of the jetted_ink and ( 3 ) substantially cure
First the district_court construed the claim term `` cold_UV '' to mean `` an ultraviolet light source which : ( i ) employs selected wavelengths to limit ; or ( ii ) has been adapted to selectively reduce the amount of ; radiation ( and thus heat ) that impinges upon a substrate ''
Id.at **2-3 *12
Next the district_court ruled that the phrase `` freeze dots of the jetted_ink '' means `` to sufficiently cure the dots of ink such that they will not spread wick or otherwise move on the substrate ''
Id.at *7 *12
Finally the district_court construed the phrase `` substantially cure '' to mean `` cured to a great_extent or almost completely cured ''
Id.at **7-8 *12

In October 2006 the parties filed cross motions for summary_judgment on the issue of infringement and VUTEk filed a motion for summary_judgment of invalidity
The district_court granted VUTEk 's motion on invalidity and deemed the remaining motions moot
Summary_Judgment_Order at 23-24
In its motion VUTEk asserted that claims 1-3 7 9-10 and 19 of the ¡¬518_patent are invalid because they are anticipated or obvious indefinite and lack written description
See *1352 id.at 1-2
The district_court found the asserted claims to be invalid on two of these grounds
Id.at 2
First the district_court first concluded that claims 1 9 10 and 19 of the ¡¬518_patent are invalid as anticipated by VUTEk 's U.S._Patent_No._6457,823 ( the `` ¡¬823_patent `` ) and claims 2 3 and 7 are invalid as obvious in light of a combination of the ¡¬823_patent and VUTEk 's U.S._Patent_No._6616,355 ( the `` ¡¬355_patent `` )
Id.at 5-18
`` Alternatively '' the district_court `` reluctantly '' agreed that these claims are invalid as indefinite because the terms `` deform deforming and deformation '' which are present in each claim `` are not capable of being construed in a way that meets the definiteness requirement of [ 35 U.S.C ] ¡± 112 ''
Id.at 18-23

For these reasons the district_court granted VUTEk 's motion for summary_judgment of invalidity
Id.at 23
The district_court then entered final judgment declaring claims 1-3 7 9-10 and 19 of the ¡¬518_patent invalid
Leggett & Platt Inc. v. Vutek Inc. No._4 :05-CV-788 2007_WL_2030134_(E.D.Miss._July_9,_2007)
L & P timely appealed
We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
