No._2008-1333
| Feb._9,_2009
Synopsis
Background : Assignee brought action against competitors alleging infringement of patent related to candle_holder apparatus
The United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of Illinois Samuel Der-Yeghiayan J. construed disputed claims 2006_WL_1049581 concluded that competitors had infringed patent 514_F.Supp.2d_1051 and denied reconsideration 553_F.Supp.2d_939
Competitors appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Lourie Circuit_Judge held that :

phrase `` to seat '' did not require engagement between feet and cover ;

combination of putting feet on bottom of candle_holder and using cover as base for candle_holder was predictable variation and thus patent was obvious ;

minimal indications of commercial success did not outweigh clear indication of obviousness apparent from prior_art ; and

patent had not been infringed by accused product that was reasonably capable of being put into claimed configuration

Reversed vacated and remanded

Because the court erred as a matter of law in failing to find claims 1_and_5 of the ¡¬969_patent to have been obvious and in finding infringement of those claims we reverse

BACKGROUND
Ball_Aerosol and Specialty_Container Inc. ( `` BASC '' ) owns the ¡¬969_patent by assignment from former employee Jivan Kumar Kholsa
The ¡¬969_patent claims a candle_tin with a removable_cover that also acts as a base for the candle_holder
When a candle_holder is placed directly on a table or other surface the heat of the lit candle can cause scorching or damage to the surface
Putting a candle_tin in the configuration claimed in the ¡¬969_patent with the candle_holder resting on top of the cover minimizes this scorching by removing the candle_holder from direct contact with the underlying surface
The ¡¬969_patent also claims protrusions or feet on the closed_end of the candle_holder that rest on top of the closed_end of the cover when it is used as a base as depicted in the figure below

*987. ?
¡¬969_patent fig.1 B

In 2003 Limited designed the accused Travel Candle which is a square-shaped candle_tin with a removable_cover and four protrusions on the closed_end of the candle_holder
On October 25 2004 BASC sued Limited for infringement in the United_States_District_Court for the Eastern District of Michigan
The case was transferred to the Northern_District of Illinois on May_31,_2005
BASC ultimately limited its allegations of infringement to claims 1_and_5 of the ¡¬ 969 patent which read as follows : 1
A candle_tin_comprising : a hollow candle_holder closed at one end in which a candle is disposed the candle having a wick for the candle to burn when the wick is lit the lit candle producing heat a portion of which is transferred through the holder to a surface upon which the candle_tin is placed ; a cover sized to fit over the holder and removably placed over an open_end of the holder to cover the candle when the candle is not lit the cover when removed being placed upon the surface with the holder being set upon the cover for the cover to support the holder above the surface whereby the heat generated by the burning candle does not damage the surface the holder and cover being cup shaped with the cover placed upon the surface_open_end down so a closed_end of the cover supports the holder above the surface a closed_end of the holder being adjacent the closed_end of the cover ; and protrusions formed on the closed_end of the holder and extending therefrom the protrusions resting upon the closed_end of the cover to seat the holder on the cover

'969_patent col.5 ll.35-56 ; id
col.6 ll.10-30

On April_19,_2006 the district_court construed the term `` to seat '' to mean `` to either rest on or fit into the cover ''
Claim_Construction_Opinion 2006_WL_1049581 at *2
The parties had disagreed on whether the portion of claims 1_and_5 relating to the protrusions required that they lock in or engage the closed_end of the cover in some way when the candle_tin was configured as described in the claims i.e. with the candle_holder resting on top of the cover
The court reasoned that because not all of the figures in the patent showed the feet on the bottom of the candle_holder fitting into recesses in the closed_end of the cover when the candle was in this configuration the term `` to seat '' did not require an engagement between the holder and the cover

On June_28,_2006 the district_court denied Limited 's motion for summary_judgment of anticipation because a genuine issue of material fact existed regarding whether a cover was inherently disclosed in the prior_art specifically in U.S._Patent 6,398,544 ( `` Wright '' )
The court also denied Limited 's motion for summary_judgment of obviousness
The court found that Limited had proven that `` all of the elements of claims 1_and_5 in the ¡¬969 [ p ] atent are found in the prior_art '' encompassed by Wright and U.S._Patent 3,285,694 ( `` Marchi '' )
Infringement_Opinion No._05-_CV-3684 slip op.at 11
However the court rejected Limited 's argument-that the motivation to combine was `` self-evident '' because `` the prior_art seeks to solve the same problem '' of scorching caused by the candle_holder-as failing to provide clear and convincing evidence of a motivation to combine the prior_art
Id.at 11-12
The court stated that Limited had `` simply supplied prior_art containing the elements of claims 1_and_5 of the ¡¬969 [ p ] atent and used conclusory_statements in lieu of an explanation of the motivation to combine the sources they have alleged ''
Id.at 12

In the same decision the district_court granted BASC 's motion for summary_judgment of infringement
The court stated that the language of claims 1_and_5 supported a finding that the candle_tin need only have `` a cover that is simply capable of being placed over the open_end of the candle_holder and also used as a base for the holder rather than at all times being placed in those positions ''
Id.at 17

Two days later on June_30,_2006 the district_court issued a sua sponte order declaring that the ¡¬969_patent was `` valid '' as a matter of law `` based upon the reasons stated '' for denying Limited 's summary_judgment motion of invalidity in the Infringement_Opinion
Validity_Motion No._05-_CV-3684 slip op.at 1 2006_WL_6178978
The court found that `` no reasonable_trier of fact could find other than that the Plaintiff 's patent is valid ''
Id

On August 16 2006 the district_court denied a motion by Limited for leave to file a supplemental motion for summary_judgment of indefiniteness
After both parties submitted summary_judgment briefing on damages the court denied the motions
On June_22,_2007 after receiving briefing on the impact of the Supreme Court 's decision in KSR International Co. v. Teleflex Inc. 550_U.S._398 127_S.Ct._1727 167_L.Ed.2d_705_(2007) on the prior ruling of patent_validity the district_court *989 reaffirmed its earlier determination that Limited had failed to provide an adequate motivation to combine the prior_art
In its docket entry the court quoted KSR as stating that the analysis of a motivation to combine `` should be made explicit ''
Ball_Aerosol & Specialty_Container Inc. v. Limited_Brands Inc. No._2 :05-CV-3684 slip op.at 1-2 ( N.D.Ill
June_22,_2007 ) ( document 191 ) ( `` KSR Analysis Order `` ) ( quoting KSR 127 S.Ct.at 1741 )
Because the district_court had based its rejection of Limited 's obviousness argument in the Infringement_Opinion on a finding that Limited used `` conclusory_statements '' the court reaffirmed its determination that `` no reasonable_trier of fact could find other than '' that the ¡¬969_patent was `` valid ''
Id

On September 4 2007 the district_court granted BASC 's motion for summary_judgment on damages and determined also on summary_judgment that Limited had willfully infringed the ¡¬969_patent
The court awarded BASC a reasonable royalty and enhanced damages
On March_27,_2008 the court denied Limited 's motion for reconsideration in its entirety by again concluding inter alia that the court 's previous finding of patent_validity was a proper application of the clear and convincing standard and consistent with KSR
The court also found that its finding of willful infringement was consistent with In re Seagate Techology LLC 497_F.3d_1360_(Fed.Cir.2007)

On April_23,_2008 Limited timely appealed the district_court 's claim construction and grants of summary_judgment on the issues of patent_validity infringement and damages
We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
