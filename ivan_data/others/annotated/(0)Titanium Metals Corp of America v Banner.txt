Opinion
RICH Circuit_Judge
This appeal is from an Order of the United_States_District_Court for the District of Columbia in a civil action brought pursuant to 35 U.S.C.¡± 145 against Donald W. Banner as Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks1 authorizing the Commissioner to issue to appellee a patent containing claims 1 2 and 3 of patent application serial No._598935 for `` TITANIUM ALLOY ''
The Commissioner has appealed
We reverse

Background
The inventors Loren C. Covington and Howard R. Palmer employees of appellee to whom they have assigned their invention and the application thereon filed an application on March_29,_1974 serial No._455964 to patent an alloy they developed
The application involved on this appeal is a continuation-in-part thereof filed July_25,_1975 containing the three claims on appeal
The alloy is made primarily of titanium ( Ti ) and contains small amounts of nickel ( Ni ) and molybdenum ( Mo ) as alloying ingredients to give the alloy certain desirable properties particularly corrosion_resistance in hot brine solutions while retaining workability so that articles such as tubing can be fabricated from it by rolling welding and other techniques
The inventors apparently also found that iron content should be limited iron being an undesired impurity rather than an alloying ingredient
They determined the permissible ranges of the components above and below which the desired properties were not obtained
A precise definition of the invention sought to be patented is found in the claims set forth below claim 3 representing the preferred composition it being understood however that no iron at all would be even more preferred
1
A titanium_base_alloy consisting essentially by weight of about 0.6 % to 0.9 %_nickel 0.2 % to 0.4 %_molybdenum up to 0.2 %_maximum_iron balance_titanium said alloy being characterized by good corrosion_resistance in hot brine environments
2
A titanium_base_alloy as set forth in Claim 1 having up to 0.1 % iron balance_titanium
3
A titanium_base_alloy as set forth in Claim 1_having_08 %_nickel 0.3 %_molybdenum up to 0.1 %_maximum_iron balance_titanium

The examiner 's final rejection repeated in his Answer on appeal to the Patent and Trademark_Office ( PTO ) Board of Appeals ( board ) was on the grounds that claims 1_and_2 are anticipated ( fully met ) by and claim 3 would have been obvious from an article by Kalabukhova and Mikheyew Investigation of the Mechanical Properties of Ti-Mo-Ni Alloys Russian Metallurgy ( Metally ) No._3 pages 130-133 ( 1970 ) ( in the court below and hereinafter called `` the Russian_article '' ) under 35 U.S.C.¡±¡± 102_and_103 respectively
The board affirmed the examiner 's rejection
However it mistakenly proceeded on the assumption that all three claims had been rejected as anticipated under ¡± 102 by the Russian_article and ignored the obviousness rejection
On this appeal the PTO says it does not pursue the ¡± 103 rejection further
Appellee proceeds on the basis that only the ¡± 102 rejection is before us

Both the examiner and the board had before them as evidence three affidavits by Rosenberg Palmer and Hall and a declaration by Minkler by which they were not persuaded of patentability

The Russian_article is short ( 3 pages ) highly technical and contains 10 graphs as part of the discussion
As its title indicates it relates to ternary Ti-Mo-Ni alloys the subject of the application at bar
The examiner and the board both found that it would disclose to one skilled in the art an *777 alloy on which at least claims 1_and_2 read so that those claims would not be allowable under the statute because of lack of novelty of their subject matter
Since the article does not specifically disclose such an alloy in words a little thinking is required about what it would disclose to one knowledgeable about Ti-Ni-Mo alloys
The PTO did that thinking as follows : Figure lc [ a graph ] shows data for the ternary titanium alloy which contains Mo and Ni in the ratio of 1:3
Amongst the actual points on the graph is one at 1 %_Mo + Ni
At this point the amounts of Mo and Ni would be 0.25 % and 0.75 % respectively
A similar point appears on the graph shown in Figure 2 of the article
... Appellants do not deny that the data_points are disclosed in the reference
In fact the Hall affidavit indicates at least two specific points ( at 1 % and 1.25 %_Mo + Ni ) which would represent a description of alloys falling within the scope of the instant claims

On that basis the board found that the claimed alloys were not new because they were disclosed in the prior art
It having been argued that the Russian_article contains no disclosure of corrosion-resistant properties of any of the alloys the board held : The fact that a particular property or the end use for this alloy as contemplated by appellants was not recognized in the article is of no consequence
It therefore held the Russian_article to be an anticipation noting that although the article does not discuss corrosion_resistance it does disclose other properties such as strength and ductility
The PTO further points out that the authors of the reference must have made the alloys to obtain the data_points

Being dissatisfied with the decision of the board Titanium Metals Corporation of America as assignee of the Covington and Palmer application then brought an action in the District_Court for the District of Columbia against the Commissioner pursuant to 35 U.S.C.¡± 145 its complaint alleging that the board 's decision `` was erroneous and contrary to law '' and making profert of a certified copy of the application and all papers in the file thereof together with a copy of the Russian_article which was the sole basis of the PTO refusal to allow the claims
It prayed that the court adjudge it entitled to a patent containing claims 1-3 and authorize the Commissioner to grant such a patent
The Commissioner filed an answer denying that the applicants were the first inventors of the alloys claimed or entitled to a patent alleging that the claims are not patentable under the law and making profert of the Examiner 's Answer the Board of Appeals ' decision and the prior art reference

The case came on for trial on January 24 1980 before the Honorable John G. Penn and was concluded in two and a half hours
The testimony of one witness was heard by the court Dr. James C. Williams professor at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh and an expert in titanium metallurgy
His testimony was about equally divided between direct and cross examination

At the conclusion of the plaintiff 's case the following exchange took place between the judge and the Associate Solicitor for the PTO : THE COURT : All right
Mr. Tarring ?
MR. TARRING : Your Honor generally the position of the Patent Office is we rely on the position of the tribunals below the examiner and the Board of Appeals and their decisions are both present in the exhibit which I submitted earlier
I was not quite sure whether you would prefer that we have a post-trial brief in the matter
If that 's your preference we could do that or I could make an argument on the basis of the law right now
I do n't know what your preference would be
Otherwise I 'm not going to call any witnesses
THE COURT : You are not going to what ?
MR. TARRING : I have no intention of calling any witnesses so it 's really a matter of argument at this point I think
*778 THE COURT : Of course I have received your pre-trial briefs
After further discussion it was settled that both parties would file further briefs after the hearing transcript had been prepared
They were filed in April and May 1980
On November 16 1984 the District_Court entered the Order appealed from followed on November 28 by a supporting memorandum opinion
January 10 1985 the PTO filed its Notice of Appeal
This court has heard oral argument and received briefs
