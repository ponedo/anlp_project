Opinion
RADER Circuit_Judge
In 1983 appellant Fox_Industries Inc. ( Fox ) filed a complaint in the United_States_District_Court for the District of Maryland
Appellant accused appellee Structural_Preservation_Systems Inc. ( SPS ) of infringing U.S. Patent No._4019,301 ( the '301_patent )
The '301_patent covers fiberglass encasements which protect concrete bridge piles from water erosion

After a two-week trial the district_court refused to enforce any of the '301_patent 's claims due to appellant 's inequitable_conduct *803 before the Patent and Trademark_Office ( PTO )
See Fox_Indus Inc. v. Structural_Preservation_Sys Inc. 6_USPQ2d_1577 1988_WL_18937_(D.Md.1988)
The Maryland District Court further found that SPS had not infringed the '301_patent
The trial court also determined that appellant had misused the patent
In response to SPS 's motion the district_court ordered appellant to pay more than $ 160,000.00 in attorney_fees and costs
See Fox_Indus Inc. v. Structural_Preservation_Sys Inc. 1990_WL_27880_(D.Md.)
Fox appeals both the judgment and the fee award
This court affirms

BACKGROUND
Appellant 's principal Douglas Fox invented the '301_patent ed subject matter
The prosecution history of the '301_patent includes an original application filed April_27,_1971 and three continuing applications filed March 1973 July 1974 and October 1975
Walter Finch the attorney who filed the 1971_and_1973 applications left appellant 's employ in 1974
Appellant retained new patent counsel Edward Levy to continue the prosecution
During prosecution of the '301 predecessor applications appellant amended claims to describe the flexibility of the fiberglass jacket
Finch admitted during trial that the original 1971 application did not disclose jacket flexibility
This characteristic therefore constituted new matter
The PTO eventually rejected all claims in the 1971_and_1973 applications
The district_court concluded that the earliest filing date for the invention as claimed was March_5,_1973

More than one year prior to the March_5,_1973 filing date Douglas Fox published a sales brochure entitled FX-70 Structural Fiberglass System ( June 1971 ) ( brochure )
Finch used this brochure as source material in drafting the 1973 application
The district_court found that the brochure teaches every feature specified in the claims of the '301_patent except one limitation in claim 10
The court further found that the brochure was more relevant than any other single reference cited during prosecution
Appellant did not disclose the brochure to the PTO during prosecution of the four applications leading to the '301_patent
