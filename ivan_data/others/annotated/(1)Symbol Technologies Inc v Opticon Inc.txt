935_F.2d_1569
United States Court of Appeals Federal Circuit
SYMBOL TECHNOLOGIES INC. Plaintiff-Appellee v. OPTICON INC. and Opto Electronics Defendants-Appellants
No._90-1409
| June_14,_1991
| Rehearing Denied Sept._6,_1991
Synopsis
Holder of patents for laser bar_code scanners brought suit alleging that bar_code scanning devices were infringing and alleged infringer filed counterclaim for declaratory_judgment that two patents were invalid and unenforceable
The United_States_District_Court for the Southern_District of New_York Kimba M. Wood J. concluded that patents were not proven invalid or unenforceable and found infringement
Alleged infringer appealed
The Court of Appeals Clevenger Circuit_Judge held that : ( 1 ) laser bar_code scanner patents using `` aim and shoot '' feature and using repetitive self-scanning of bar_code_symbol until it is decoded were not shown to be invalid for obviousness although prior_art included portable laser scanning head which detected and decoded laser_beams reflected from bar_codes and erroneously excluded prior_art reference disclosed laser scanning head for reading bar_code_symbols that had trigger and ( 2 ) patent for laser bar_code scanning device with `` aim and shoot '' feature was not available as reference against divisional patent which included `` aim and shoot '' feature but also additional features including means for repetitively self-scanning bar_code_symbol until it was decoded and termination of repetitive scan if no successful decode were achieved so the divisional patent application was not invalid for obviousness-type double patenting

Opinion
CLEVENGER Circuit_Judge
*1572 Symbol Technologies Inc. ( Symbol ) sued Opticon Inc. and its Japanese parent Opto Electronics ( collectively hereinafter Opticon ) in the United_States_District_Court for the Southern_District of New_York for infringement of certain claims of United States Patent Nos._4387,297 ( '297_patent ) 4,593,186 ( '186_patent ) and 4,409,470 ( '470_patent )

Symbol alleged that Opticon 's MSH-840 MSH-850 and MSH-860 devices were infringing
Opticon denied infringement and filed a counterclaim for a declaratory_judgment that the '297 and '186_patent s are invalid and unenforceable
Following a non-jury trial the District_Court concluded that the '297 and '186_patent s were not proved invalid or unenforceable and found infringement.1 Symbol Technologies Inc. v. Opticon Inc. 17_USPQ2d_1737 1990_WL_58887_(S.D.N.Y.1990)
The court entered a liability judgment for Symbol

Opticon appeals the judgment of the District_Court
This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.¡± 1292 ( c ) ( 2 ) ( 1988 ) to entertain Opticon 's appeal
Because no reversible error was committed we affirm

I
BACKGROUND
The patents relate to devices that employ lasers to read bar_code_symbols and methods of their use
The application that issued as the '297_patent was filed on February 29 1980
In the first official action the examiner required restriction to one of seven species identified as Groups I-VII
The applicants elected Group I claims directed to a light-weight_laser_scanning_head which matured into the '297_patent

The '297_patent specification refers to two types of previously known laser scanning devices
The first type often mounted in supermarket and other checkout counters requires a user to bring the symbol-bearing object to the stationary scanner
Its usefulness is limited to decoding symbols on objects that can be brought to the device
The second_type uses a wand or pen that emits a scanning laser_beam
The user places the pen in physical_contact with the object then manually drags the pen across the symbol
This second_type requires user training because successful_decoding depends on pen angle pressure and speed of passage as the pen is dragged across the bar_code
Multiple passes of the pen are often required to achieve a single reading
Moreover the tips of pen scanners tend to scar the bar_codes and are not useful on wax coated containers such as milk cartons on soft products such as bagged potato chips or on reflective aluminum cans

In contrast the invention claimed in the '297_patent is a portable light-weight_laser_scanning_head that operates without physical_contact with the bar_code
See Figure 1
In gun-like fashion the user sights the bar_code unobstructed by the device then depresses a trigger to initiate decoding
Each time the trigger is depressed the hand-held device sweeps a scanning laser_beam laterally across the bar_code by use of mirrors
The examiner considered this `` aim and shoot '' feature to be a novel distinguishing characteristic of the claimed invention over the prior_art
All of the asserted '297_patent claims depend on claim 1 reprinted in the Appendix which in pertinent part claims the `` aim and shoot '' feature as : ( c ) miniature optic means.. to permit the user to conveniently register the laser_light_beam on the symbol by sighting the symbol along a direct line of sight which does not pass through the housing ; ( d ) miniature scanning means mounted in the light_path and in the interior space of the housing for cyclically sweeping the laser_light_beam across the bar_code_symbol for reflection_therefrom ;

* * * * * * ( h ) handle means for normally supporting the light-weight_laser_scanning_head in a non-contacting relationship with the symbol during reading thereof ; and
*1573 ( i ) manually actuatable trigger means on the housing for initiating reading of the symbol each time the trigger means is manually actuated by the user

Before the '297_patent issued the applicants filed a divisional_application directed to the originally non-elected Group VI claims described in the restriction as a `` method '' of scanning sensing and decoding bar_code_symbols
Thereafter the applicants filed a continuation of the divisional_application which eventually issued as the '186_patent
The '186_patent contains apparatus claims 1-10 and method_claims 11-15 with the method_claims closely corresponding to the original Group VI claims
The broadest asserted apparatus and method_claims reprinted in the Appendix both require a `` trigger '' and `` repetitively '' scan `` the directed laser_beam across each symbol for reflection_therefrom ''
Thus the '186_patent claims a system that repetitively scans and senses a bar_code_symbol each time a user depresses the trigger
Each symbol is decoded from repetitive rather than single scans thereby increasing the likelihood of achieving accurate decoding even for poorly printed symbols
In addition claim 1 and claim 11 include limiting language for `` determining a successful_decoding of each symbol '' and for `` non-manually terminating the reading of each symbol upon the determination of the successful_decoding thereof ''
See Appendix
Thus the invented system alerts the user and automatically stops scanning when the symbol is decoded permitting rapid and sequential decoding of multiple objects

The same applicants claimed an advance over the invention of the '297_patent in an application filed on January 25 1982 which later issued as the '470_patent
The '470_patent specification explains that because the scanning laser_beam of the invention *1574 claimed in the '297_patent passes through the inside of the device `` a great deal of interior 'dead ' space within the head '' is required in order to accommodate the scanning beam

In contrast the '470_patent discloses a scanning head with a raised rear window that emits the laser_beam over the outside top of the device rather than inside its housing
Claim 1 of the '470_patent reprinted in the Appendix includes : ( g ) window means mounted on the housing and having a light-transmissive window at the rear region in close adjacent confronting relationship with the scanning means thereat said window being configured and positioned in the light_path of said at least one swept beam to permit the latter to pass through the window and unobstructedly travel exteriorly of and past the front and intermediate_body_regions of the housing
whereby the field of view of the swept beam is substantially independent of the predetermined width of the housing due to its exterior transmission outside of the front and intermediate_body_regions of the housing
Thus since the device no longer must accommodate the sweep width of the scanning beam the invention allows a narrowing of the body of the device with a corresponding reduction in overall size and weight
