LOURIE Circuit_Judge
Cordis Corporation and Johnson & Johnson Inc. ( collectively `` Cordis '' ) appeal from the judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the District of Delaware denying a motion for a new_trial and judgment as a matter of law ( `` JMOL '' ) following a jury verdict of infringement of claim 8 of U.S._Patent 6,120,536 ( `` the ¡¬536_patent `` )
See Boston_Scientific_Scimed Inc. v. Cordis_Corp. No._03-283- SLR 2005_WL_1322946 2005 U.S._Dist

Because the court erred as a matter of law in failing to hold the ¡¬ 536 patent to have been obvious we reverse the judgment

BACKGROUND
Boston_Scientific_Scimed Inc. and Boston_Scientific_Corporation ( collectively `` Boston_Scientific '' ) own the ¡¬536_patent which relates to a drug-eluting expandable_stent with a coating that has a non-thrombogenic surface
Boston_Scientific sued Cordis in March 2003 alleging inter alia that Cordis 's Cypher_stent infringed claim *984 8 of the ¡¬536_patent
Claim 8 the only claim on appeal depends from claim 6 which depends from claim 1
Claims 1 6 and 8 read as follows : 1
A medical_device having at least a portion which is implantable into the body of a patient wherein at least a part of the device_portion is metallic and at least part of the metallic device_portion is covered with a coating for release of at least one biologically active_material wherein said coating comprises an undercoat comprising a hydrophobic elastomeric material incorporating an amount of biologically active_material therein for timed release therefrom and wherein said coating further comprises a topcoat which at least partially covers the undercoat said topcoat comprising a biostable non-thrombogenic material which provides long term nonthromobogenicity to the device_portion during and after release of the biologically active_material and wherein said topcoat is substantially free of an elutable_material
6
The device of claim 1 wherein the medical_device is an expandable_stent
8
The device of claim 6 wherein the stent comprises a tubular body having open ends and an open lattice sidewall structure and wherein the coating conforms to said sidewall structure in a manner that preserves said open lattice
¡¬536_patent col. 13 l.13-col. 14 l.4 ( filed June_13,_1996 )

In June 2005 the district_court construed certain limitations of claim 8
The court held that the phrase `` non-thrombogenic material which provides long term non-thrombogenicity to the device_portion during and after release of the biologically active_material '' in claim 1 means `` a material that does not promote thrombosis for a period of time that extends both during and after release of the biologically active_material ''
Claim_Construction_Opinion 2005 U.S._Dist
LEXIS 10735 at *3 2005_WL_1322946 at *1
The court relied on medical dictionary definitions for the meaning of `` thrombogenic '' ( `` causing thrombosis or coagulation of the blood '' ) and `` thrombolytic '' ( `` break [ ing ] up or dissolv [ ing ] a thrombus '' ) `` thrombolytic '' being a term the patentee used in the specification but not the claims
Id.at *BIG_TOKEN__3_n._6__BIG_TOKEN 2005_WL_1322946 at *BIG_TOKEN__1_n._6__BIG_TOKEN
The court rejected Cordis 's proposed definition of `` non-thrombogenic '' which required a `` significant reduction in thrombogenicity over that experienced with bare metal stents ''
Id.at *BIG_TOKEN__4_n._7__BIG_TOKEN 2005_WL_1322946 at *1 n.7
The court also construed the phrase `` substantially free of an elutable_material '' to mean `` largely or approximately free of an elutable_material ''
Id.at *4 2005_WL_1322946 *1

Cordis makes the Cypher drug-eluting expandable_stent
The Cypher_stent has two coatings : an undercoat containing the drug and a topcoat
Early in the manufacturing process the Cypher_stent 's topcoat is drug-free
The topcoat is sprayed on as a solution containing no drug but containing a polymer and two solvents tetrahydrofuran ( or THF ) and toluene both of which are toxic to humans
The solvents dissolve the drug allowing it to diffuse from the undercoat into the topcoat
Thus when the Cypher_stent is sterilized removing any remaining solvent the drug has moved into the topcoat to such an extent that the topcoat and undercoat contain the same concentration of drug
The topcoat is thinner than the undercoat ; it contains about 23 % of the total amount of the drug in the stent after sterilization

At trial the jury found that claim 8 of the ¡¬536_patent would not have been obvious based on among other prior art references U.S._Patent 5,545,208 ( `` Wolff '' ) and U.S._Patent 5,512,055 ( `` Domb '' )
The jury *985 also found that the Cypher_stent infringed claim 8
After trial Cordis filed a renewed motion for JMOL or in the alternative a new_trial on infringement and validity
The court denied Cordis 's motion

In doing so the district_court upheld the jury 's nonobviousness finding over Domb Wolff and several other references
The court reasoned that Domb which discloses esophageal stents does not suggest the use of metal in a stent and that there was no evidence of motivation to combine Domb with other references
Opinion_Denying_JMOL 434 F.Supp.2d at 320
The court reasoned that Wolff according to one expert does not teach a metallic stent having a two-layer coating and the failure of Wolff 's assignee to create the claimed stent after more than a decade of work evidenced a lack of motivation to combine the features of its various prior art stents with each other
Id
Finally as a secondary consideration of nonobviousness the court found from expert testimony that the praise for and commercial success of the Cypher_stent were due to the claimed features and that even after identifying an appropriate drug and stent it took Cordis a great deal of time to develop a drug-eluting stent
Id.at 321

Regarding infringement the district_court reasoned that the jury 's infringement finding was based on substantial_evidence because three experts had testified that Cypher was non-thrombogenic
Id.at 316-17
As for the `` substantially free '' limitation the court found support for the jury 's infringement finding in a witness 's testimony that the topcoat is drug-free when applied and `` has about 1_to_2 %_drug.. after manufacturing is completed '' finding that 1_to_2 %_drug may be considered `` substantially free ''
Id.at 315
The court also pointed to evidence that a stent need not be sterilized to be implantable and thus that the stent could infringe during manufacture when the topcoat was first applied and was then drug-free
Id
The court referred to testimony that concluded after applying the court 's claim_construction that the Cypher_stent was substantially free of elutable_material
Id
Finally the court found that the ¡¬536_patent specifically contemplates that the drug will move into the topcoat prior to implantation implying that the `` substantially free '' limitation does not preclude the topcoat from containing 23 % of the drug
Id
The court thus held that the jury 's finding of infringement was based on substantial_evidence

After the district_court denied Cordis 's motions Cordis again moved for a new_trial based on newly discovered evidence that the FDA had found an increased risk of thrombosis in patients who had been treated with drug-eluting stents
Thus according to Cordis the Cypher_stent could not `` provide [ ] long term non-thrombogenicity ''
¡¬536_patent col.13 ll.23-24
The court denied Cordis 's second motion for a new_trial because the FDA had opined that an increased risk of death and heart attack was only possibly due to stent thrombosis and thus that the new evidence was too speculative to warrant either dismissal or a new_trial
Opinion Denying New Trial 2007_WL_2775087 at *3

Cordis timely appealed the district_court 's claim_construction the denial of JMOL on both obviousness and noninfringement and the denial of a new_trial
We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
