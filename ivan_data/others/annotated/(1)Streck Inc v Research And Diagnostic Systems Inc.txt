United States Court of Appeals Federal Circuit
STRECK INC. Plaintiff-Appellee v. RESEARCH & DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEMS INC. and Techne_Corporation Defendants-Appellants
No._2011-1044
| Jan._10,_2012
Synopsis
Background : Patentee brought action for alleged infringement of three patents for hematology_control_technology
Competitor counterclaimed for declaratory_judgment of noninfringement and invalidity
After construing patent_claims 2008_WL_4891132 the United_States_District_Court for the District of Nebraska Joseph F. Bataillon Chief Judge 658_F.Supp.2d_988 granted partial summary_judgment for patentee and after granting judgment as a matter of law for patentee on enablement 2010_WL_3926059 denied competitor 's renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law and motion for new_trial and finally issued permanent_injunction
Competitor appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals O'Malley Circuit_Judge held that :

district_court lacked jurisdiction over counterclaim seeking declaratory_judgment of invalidity as to patent_claims not included by patentee in its infringement_allegations ;

patents provided adequate written description for integrated controls using either true_reticulocytes or reticulocyte_analogs ;

patents enabled claimed integrated_hematology_control using both true_reticulocytes and reticulocyte_analogs ;

priority determination by Court of Appeals in companion appeal rendered moot competitor 's arguments on appeal related to priority issue ; and

permanent_injunction was not overbroad

Affirmed

Opinion
O'MALLEY Circuit_Judge
In this patent case Streck Inc. ( `` Streck '' ) filed suit against Research & Diagnostic Systems Inc. and Techne_Corporation ( collectively `` R & D '' ) in the United_States_District_Court for the District of Nebraska alleging that R & D infringed three of Streck 's patents for hematology_control_technology : U.S. Patent Nos._6200,500 ( `` the ¡¬500_Patent `` ) 6,221,668 ( `` the ¡¬668_Patent `` ) and 6,399,388 ( `` the ¡¬388_Patent `` ) ( collectively `` the patents-in-suit '' )
R & D counterclaimed for declaratory_judgment of noninfringement and invalidity

R & D appeals from the district_court 's : ( 1 ) dismissal of R & D 's invalidity counterclaims with respect to claims Streck did not include in its infringement_allegations ( the `` unasserted_claims '' ) ; ( 2 ) denial of summary_judgment for R & D and grant *1274 of summary_judgment for Streck on written description ; ( 3 ) denial of judgment as a matter of law ( `` JMOL '' ) for R & D and grant of JMOL for Streck on enablement ; ( 4 ) denial of R & D 's renewed motion for JMOL and motion for a new_trial on priority ; and ( 5 ) issuance of a permanent_injunction
Streck Inc. v. Research & Diagnostic Sys. Inc. 658_F.Supp.2d_988 ( D.Neb.2009 ) ( `` Summary Judgment Order `` ) ; Streck Inc. v. Research & Diagnostic Sys. Inc. No._8 :06cv458 2010_WL_3926059 2010 U.S. Dist
LEXIS 104461 ( D.Neb
Sept._30,_2010 ) ( `` Denial of Renewed JMOL Order `` )
Because we conclude that the district_court did not err in refusing to address the validity of the unasserted_claims and correctly denied R & D 's written description and enablement defenses as a matter of law and because the issue of priority is controlled by this court 's resolution in Appeal No.2011-1045,1 we affirm the district_court 's judgment against R & D and its decision granting a permanent_injunction in favor of Streck

BACKGROUND
A
Factual Background
The technology involved in this case relates to hematology controls
These controls are used to monitor and test the accuracy and consistency of hematology_analyzers which clinical laboratories use to analyze patient blood samples
Specifically hematology_analyzers measure the various components of whole_blood including red blood cells white_blood_cells platelets and reticulocytes,2 and the information gathered is used to diagnose and treat diseases
Both Streck and R & D manufacture and sell hematology control products

Prior to 1996 hematology instruments measured reticulocytes and white_blood_cells separately and thus required separate stand-alone hematology controls-i.e. those that measured only a single component of blood
Stand-alone controls using true_reticulocytes3 and reticulocyte_analogs were well-known in the art before the applications that matured into the patents-in-suit were filed
Dr. Alan Johnson a senior scientist at R & D is a named co-inventor on U.S._Patent_No._5736,402 ( `` the ¡¬402_Patent `` ) which claims stand-alone true reticulocyte controls
In the mid-1990s Dr. Wayne Ryan the majority owner and Chief Executive Officer of Streck invented and patented a method for making reticulocyte_analogs and using those analogs in a stand-alone control
See U.S._Patent_No._5432,089 ( `` the ¡¬089_Patent `` )
The ¡¬089_Patent explains that reticulocyte_analogs `` exhibit a reticulocyte continuum and distribution that is similar to that of normal human reticulocytes ''
¡¬089_Patent col. 8_ll._36 -39

Hematology instrument manufacturers began developing a hematology analyzer that could measure both reticulocytes and white_blood_cells simultaneously in the same blood sample
Accordingly there was a need for an integrated_hematology_control containing at least : ( 1 ) a stabilized reticulocyte_component ; and ( 2 ) a fixed and stabilized white_blood_cell_component
*1275 Over time both R & D and Streck began working on projects aimed at developing an integrated_hematology_control

On August 20 1999 Streck filed a patent application directed to an integrated_reticulocyte_control
That application became the ¡¬500_Patent which issued on March_31,_2001
Ryan is the named inventor on the ¡¬500_Patent
The ¡¬668_Patent which issued on April_24,_2001 and the ¡¬388_Patent which issued on June_4,_2002 are continuations of the ¡¬500_Patent
Ryan and John Scholl Streck 's research and development manager are named as coinventors on the ¡¬668 and ¡¬388_Patent s. Both Ryan and Scholl assigned their rights in the patents to Streck

The parties agree that Claim 1 of the ¡¬668_Patent is representative for this appeal
It claims `` [ a ] hematology control composition comprising : a ) a stabilized reticulocyte_component ; and b ) a fixed and stabilized white_blood_cell_component capable of exhibiting a five-part differential ''
¡¬668_Patent_col. 16_ll._41 -45
The specification explains that : the control may suitably contain stabilized reticulocytes ( that is immature anucleate red blood cells containing some ribonucleic acid ) or an analog thereof
For example among possible embodiments the reticulocyte_component may comprise true mammalian reticulocytes prepared for instance by mammalian ( e.g
human ) red blood cell encapsulation or by isolation from whole_blood
The reticulocyte_component is prepared in any suitable manner
See e.g. [ the ¡¬089_Patent ]
Alternatively it is possible to obtain suitable reticulocytes by obtaining blood from an anemic animal ( e.g. a pig goat rabbit or the like )
¡¬668_Patent_col. 3_ll._14 -25
The district_court construed the patents-in-suit to encompass an integrated_reticulocyte_control using either true_reticulocytes or reticulocyte_analogs

On October 18 1999 roughly two months after Streck filed its application R & D filed its own patent application relating to integrated_reticulocyte_controls
Dr. Johnson is the named inventor of the control composition in R & D 's application
In 2003 after some of Streck 's patents had issued R & D copied claims from Streck 's patents into its still-pending application and asked the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( `` the PTO '' ) to declare an interference to determine priority of invention
Facts relating to the parties ' priority dispute are set forth in companion Appeal No.2011-1045 which was previously decided by this court
To the extent necessary those facts are incorporated by reference herein

While R & D 's interference request was pending R & D began manufacturing and selling integrated_hematology_controls the first of which was referred to as CBC-XE
R & D subsequently began producing controls under the names CBC-4K Plus Retics and CBC-5D Plus Retics as well
It is undisputed that Ryan used his reticulocyte analog as the reticulocyte_component of the integrated control when he reduced his invention to practice
In contrast R & D 's integrated controls use true_reticulocytes as the reticulocyte_component
