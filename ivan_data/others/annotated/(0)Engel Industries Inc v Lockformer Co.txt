ENGEL INDUSTRIES INC. Plaintiff-Appellee v. The LOCKFORMER COMPANY Iowa_Precision_Industries Inc. and Met-Coil_Systems_Corporation Defendants-Appellants
No._90-1482
| Oct._8,_1991
| Rehearing Denied Nov._13,_1991
Synopsis
Patent licensee for connectors of duct work segments brought declaratory_judgment_action which challenged validity of patent
The United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Missouri Clyde S. Cahill J. held that patent was invalid and that inventor engaged in inequitable_conduct
Inventors appealed
The Court of Appeals Pauline Newman Circuit_Judge held that : ( 1 ) patent was not invalid for failure to disclose best_mode ; ( 2 ) invention was enabled by description in specification ; and ( 3 ) no inequitable_conduct occurred

Reversed

Opinion
PAULINE NEWMAN Circuit_Judge
The defendants in this declaratory_judgment_action Met-Coil_Systems_Corporation and its subsidiaries The Lockformer_Company and Iowa_Precision_Industries appeal the decision of the United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Missouri.1 The court held all the claims of United States Patent No._4466,641 ( the '641_patent ) invalid for the patentee 's failure to disclose the best_mode as required by 35 U.S.C.¡± 112
The court also held that the patentee committed inequitable_conduct based on failure to disclose the best_mode and voided the agreement whereby Engel_Industries the declaratory judgment plaintiff had been licensed under the '641_patent
The district court also held that the '641_patent had not been proved invalid under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103

We reverse the rulings of invalidity and inequitable_conduct
No cross-appeal was taken from the ruling that the patent was not invalid because of obviousness

Background
The Lockformer_Company is a manufacturer of roll-forming machines that form segments of ducts that distribute air throughout a building ; Iowa_Precision_Industries manufactures equipment for this industry
Duct segments are made on roll-forming machines at or near the construction site and are connected before or during installation
According to the record before the invention described in the '641_patent these connections required rivets or spot welds procedures that were time consuming and labor intensive

In 1981 Howard McElroy an engineer employed by Iowa_Precision began work on improving the connection of duct_sections
His goal was to enable duct_sections to be connected on site in a simple manner
Mr. McElroy asked The Lockformer_Company to quote the price of a roll-forming machine that would form duct segments having a particular form of integral_flange that McElroy then had in mind
Growing out of this exchange Lockformer and Iowa_Precision which were not then sister companies decided to collaborate on this problem
Early in this collaboration two meetings were held those present including McElroy Robert Heilman ( Lockformer 's vice president of engineering ) and Leo R. Gale ( Lockformer 's executive vice president and director of sales )
These meetings were held on December 2 1981 and January 29 1982 and are pertinent to the issue of best_mode as we shall discuss

Flowing from this collaboration Messrs. Heilman and McElroy developed as joint inventors the system described and claimed in the '641_patent
In this system the duct_sections are formed with an integral_flange configured so as to engage corner_connectors in such a way that the *1530 connectors are simply snapped into place
This snap-fit made unnecessary the previously used rivets and other labor-intensive connection methods
The ducts ( 10 ) with corner_connectors ( 34 ) are illustrated in Fig._1 of the patent :

-- -- - Patent claims 1-BIG_TOKEN__6_and_13__BIG_TOKEN -19 are apparatus claims and claims 7-BIG_TOKEN__12_and_20__BIG_TOKEN -25 are method claims
Claim 1 is representative of the apparatus claims : 1
In a system for connecting the ends of sheet_metal_ducts wherein a frame is provided for each duct_end corner_connectors defining perpendicularly extending arms are associated with the frames and means are provided to interconnect the frames of adjacent_duct_ends the improvement wherein the sheet metal used for the ducts is also employed for forming said frames each said frame specifically comprising a roll-formed section consisting of an integral_part of a duct_wall each said section comprising a first_portion extending perpendicularly outwardly from a duct_wall and a second_portion bent rearwardly into a position opposite an end_portion of the duct_wall the distance between said second_portion and said end_portion substantially corresponding to the width of an arm of a corner_connector the side_edges of each such_arm being received in engagement with the respective_surfaces of a second_portion and end_portion whereby the corner_connectors are held in position relative to a frame and including retainer_means defined by said second_portion for receiving a side edge of an arm for thereby securely holding the arm in position
Claim 7 is a typical method claim : 7
In a method for connecting the ends of sheet_metal_ducts wherein a frame is *1531 provided for each duct_end corner_connectors defining perpendicularly extending arms are associated with the frames and means are provided to interconnect the frames of adjacent_duct_ends the improvement comprising the steps of forming each said frame by roll-forming a section of the duct whereby the frame comprises an integral_part of the sheet metal duct each said roll-formed section comprising a first_portion extending perpendicularly outwardly from a duct_wall and a second_portion bent rearwardly into a position opposite an end_portion of the duct_wall the distance between said second_portion and said end_portion substantially corresponding to the width of an arm of a corner_connector forming a retainer_means in said second_portion introducing the arms of the corner_connectors between respective second_portions and end_portions whereby the side_edges of each such_arm are received in engagement with the respective_surfaces of a said second_portion and end_portion to hold the corner_connectors in position relative to a frame said retainer_means assisting in the holding by said second_portion and thereafter fastening the respective connectors together to provide an assembly

Engel_Industries a manufacturer of roll-forming machines was a licensee under the '641_patent
Engel brought a declaratory_judgment_action against Lockformer Iowa_Precision and their parent company Met-Coil ( collectively `` Met-Coil '' ) seeking a declaration of invalidity and non-infringement and refund of royalties paid
