608_F.3d_1333
United States Court of Appeals Federal Circuit
TRIMED INCORPORATED Plaintiff-Appellant v. STRYKER CORPORATION Defendant-Appellee
No._2009-1423
| June_9,_2010
Synopsis
Background : Patentee brought infringement action against competitor alleging infringement of patent relating to an implantable pin plate used to set bone_fractures
The United_States_District_Court for the Central_District of California Manuel_L._Real J. granted competitor 's motion for summary_judgment of noninfringement
Patentee appealed
The Court of Appeals 514_F.3d_1256 reversed and remanded
On remand the United_States_District_Court for the Central_District of California Manuel_L._Real J. granted competitor 's motion for summary_judgment of invalidity
Patentee again appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Linn Circuit_Judge held that :

fact_issues as to whether patent was invalid as obvious precluded summary_judgment ;

district_court failed to explain its invocation of commonsense in finding patent invalid on obviousness grounds ;

district_court was required to consider evidence regarding secondary considerations of nonobviousness before determining that patent was invalid as obvious ;

fact_issues as to whether patent was invalid on anticipation grounds precluded summary_judgment ; and

reassignment on remand was warranted to preserve appearance of justice

Reversed and remanded

Opinion
LINN Circuit_Judge
This patent infringement action returns to us for a second time after having been previously appealed and remanded on claim construction and infringement questions in TriMed Inc. v. Stryker Corp. 514_F.3d_1256 ( Fed.Cir.2008 ) ( `` TriMed I `` )
In the present appeal TriMed Incorporated ( `` TriMed '' ) challenges a decision of the United_States_District_Court for the Central_District of California granting summary_judgment of invalidity of the asserted claims of U.S. Patent No._5931,839 ( `` the ¡¬839_patent `` ) in favor of Stryker Corporation ( `` Stryker '' )
Because the district_court improperly resolved genuine issues of material fact in favor of Stryker and because reassignment is advisable to preserve the appearance of justice we reverse and remand with an instruction to reassign this matter to a different judge

BACKGROUND
A
The ¡¬839_patent
TriMed is the owner of the ¡¬839_patent which covers an implantable_device used to set bone_fractures such as a type of wrist fracture known as a Colles ' fracture
The ¡¬839_patent describes four prior art methods of setting a Colles ' fracture two of which merit discussion here
In the first method referred to as open reduction and internal fixation a surgeon cuts open the wrist places the fractured_bones back in their original position ( i.e. reduces the bone_fractures ) and `` appl [ ies ] plates screws and pins as needed ''
¡¬839_patent col.2 ll.6-8
This usually involves the surgeon opening the skin above the fracture and positioning a metal plate across the fracture
The surgeon then attaches the plate to both the stable and fractured_bone_fragments with screws
The open reduction technique has several drawbacks
First the method requires the surgeon to make screw_holes in the fractured_bone which can lead to further fragmentation
Second if the fractured_bone is small or osteoporotic the screw threads can not attach the screw to the bone
Finally rotation of the screw into the fractured_fragment causes compression across the fracture which may cause the fragment to shatter

The second method known as percutaneous pinning involves inserting a first end of one or more small pins called Kirschner wires ( also referred to as `` K-wires '' ) through a fractured_bone_fragment across the fracture and into a stable_bone_fragment leaving the other_end of each pin extending out of the fractured_bone_fragment
Because a pin is less likely to weaken a fragmented bone pins are better suited than screws for fixating small or osteoporotic bone fragments
However because pins have a tendency to bend or be displaced doctors generally apply a cast to immobilize the wrist and elbow of the patient while the bone heals subjecting the patient to the stiffness and loss of function associated with the use of casts

The ¡¬839_patent describes an implantable_device that includes three kinds of *1337 components : screws pins and a plate with screw_holes on one end of the plate and pin holes on the opposite_end thereof
The patent explains that unlike prior art techniques of setting fractures the invention permits `` rigid fixation of fracture fragments while allowing immediate motion of a joint ''
¡¬839_patent col.3 ll.22-43
Figures 1_and_5 of the ¡¬839_patent are illustrative of an embodiment of the device :

?
In one method of implanting the device a surgeon opens the skin above a fracture 11 slides a pin 8 through a fractured_bone_fragment 9 across the fracture 11 and embeds the pin 8 in a stable_bone_fragment 10 leaving the other_end of the pin 8 extending above the fractured_fragment 9
The surgeon then positions a plate 1 across the fracture 11 such that the end of the pin 8 extending above the fractured_fragment 9 rests in a pin hole 3
As we observed in TriMed I the hole 3 stabilizes the projecting end of the pin 8 against movement in the plane of plate 1 and allows the pin 8 to slide axially through the plate 1 while preventing compression across the fracture 11
514 F.3d at 1260
The surgeon places the opposite_end of the plate 1 over the stable_bone_fragment 10 and attaches the plate 1 to this fragment by inserting screws 7 through screw_holes 2 in the plate 1 into the stable_bone_fragment 10
