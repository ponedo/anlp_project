Before PROST Chief_Judge REYNA Circuit Judge and STARK Chief District Judge
* Opinion
*1348 PROST Chief_Judge
This appeal arises from consolidated Hatch-Waxman proceedings involving the reformulated version of the pain reliever OxyContinTHE_R
The Appellants Purdue_Pharma_L.P. The P.F
Laboratories Inc. Purdue_Pharmaceuticals_L.P. and Rhodes_Technologies ( collectively `` Purdue '' ) and Grunenthal GmbH ( `` Grunenthal '' ) asserted a number of claims from multiple different patents against the Appellees Amneal_Pharmaceuticals LLC ( `` Amneal '' ) Epic Pharma LLC ( `` Epic '' ) Mylan_Pharmaceuticals_Inc. and Mylan_Inc. ( collectively `` Mylan '' ) and Teva_Pharmaceuticals_USA Inc. ( `` Teva '' ) all of whom have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications ( `` ANDAs '' ) seeking to sell generic versions of OxyContinTHE_R
The United_States_District_Court for the Southern_District of New_York held a three-week bench trial in the case against Teva following which it held all of the asserted patent claims invalid
In re OxyContin Antitrust Litig. 994_F.Supp.2d_367 377 ( S.D.N.Y.2014 ) ( `` District Court Decision `` )
The court then entered orders of dismissal in the three remaining cases against Amneal Epic and Mylan based on collateral estoppel
Purdue and Grunenthal appeal the final judgment in the Teva action and Purdue also appeals the orders of dismissal in the three other cases
For the reasons stated below we affirm the district court 's rulings

BACKGROUND
Oxycodone hydrochloride-the active pharmaceutical ingredient ( `` API '' ) in OxyContinTHE_R-is an opioid analgesic used to treat moderate to severe pain
This consolidated appeal concerns four patents associated with the reformulated version of OxyContinTHE_R : U.S._Patent_No._7674,799 ( `` ¡¬799_patent `` ) U.S._Patent_No._7674,800 ( `` ¡¬800_patent `` ) U.S._Patent_No._7683,072 ( `` ¡¬072_patent `` ) ( collectively `` the low-ABUK patents '' ) and U.S. Patent No._8114,383 patent ( `` ¡¬383_patent `` )
