Opinion
NEWMAN Circuit_Judge
This suit arose in accordance with the provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act codified at 35 U.S.C.¡± 271 ( e ) and 21 U.S.C.¡± 355 ( j )
The patent at issue is United_States_Patent_No._4847,265 ( the ¡¬265_patent ) owned by Sanofi-Synthelabo and related companies ( collectively `` Sanofi '' ) and covers the pharmaceutical product having the common_name clopidogrel_bisulfate and the brand name PlavixTHE_R
The product has the property of inhibiting the aggregation of blood platelets and is used to treat or prevent blood-thrombotic events such as heart attacks and strokes
We affirm the district_court 's ruling sustaining patent validity

BACKGROUND
Clopidogrel is the common_name of the dextrorotatory_isomer of the chemical compound named methyl_alpha-5 ( 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro ( 3,2-c ) thienopyridyl ) ( 2-chlorophenyl ) -acetate
Claim 3 of the patent is in suit : 3
Hydrogen sulfate of the dextro-rotatory_isomer of methyl_alpha-5 ( 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro ( 3,2-c ) thienopyridyl ) ( 2-chlorophenyl ) -acetate substantially separated from the levo-rotatory_isomer
The ¡¬265_patent was issued on July_11,_1989 with priority from an application first filed in France in 1987
Approval of the product by the United_States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) was received in 1998

*1078 Apotex Inc. filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application ( ANDA ) 1 in November 2001 for FDA_approval to sell clopidogrel_bisulfate stating pursuant to 21 U.S.C.¡± 355 ( j ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ( vii ) ( IV ) that it believed the ¡¬265_patent to be invalid
Such `` paragraph IV certification '' is defined as an act of infringement for litigation purposes 35 U.S.C.¡± 271 ( e ) in order to facilitate pre-marketing legal challenge by the producer of a generic form of a patented pharmaceutical product
In accordance with the statutory procedures Sanofi duly filed suit for infringement and Apotex counterclaimed that the ¡¬265_patent is invalid on several grounds and unenforceable
The suit initiated a thirty-month stay of FDA_approval of Apotex 's ANDA as provided by 21 U.S.C.¡± 355 ( j ) ( 5 ) ( B ) ( iii )
A proposed settlement was not achieved the statutory stay expired the FDA approved the Apotex ANDA and Apotex commenced sale of its generic clopidogrel_bisulfate product on August 8 2006
Sanofi then moved in the district_court for a preliminary injunction asking that Apotex be enjoined from marketing its infringing product while the litigation was pending noting that infringement was conceded by Apotex

The district_court found that Sanofi was likely to succeed on the merits of the validity and enforceability of the ¡¬265_patent and that the equitable factors of the balance of harms the probability of irreparable harm and the various public interests favored granting the injunction
Sanofi-Synthelabo v. Apotex_Inc. 488_F.Supp.2d_317 350 ( S.D.N.Y.2006 ) ( `` Sanofi I `` )
This court affirmed the district_court 's rulings while explaining that the record on the substantive issues was necessarily incomplete and that the district_court could review all aspects at trial
See Sanofi-Synthelabo v. Apotex_Inc. 470_F.3d_1368 1374-84 ( Fed.Cir.2006 ) ( `` Sanofi II `` ) ( holding that the patentee was likely to succeed on the merits and that the balance of hardships and public interest supported the injunction )
A bench_trial was held from January 22 to February 15 2007 following which the district_court ruled that the ¡¬265_patent is valid and enforceable
Sanofi-Synthelabo v. Apotex_Inc. 492_F.Supp.2d_353 397 ( S.D.N.Y.2007 ) ( `` Sanofi_III `` )

This appeal is focused on the question of patentability of this dextrorotatory_isomer in view of its known racemate described in earlier Sanofi patents specifically Sanofi 's United_States_Patent_No._4529,596 ( the ¡¬596_patent ) and Canadian Patent No._1194,875 ( the ¡¬875_patent )
Both reference patents are derived from the same French priority filing and are prior art against the ¡¬265_patent

The activities that led to the product in suit are discussed in the earlier opinions and are summarized as relevant herein : In 1972 Sanofi_scientists were seeking products that might have improved anti-inflammatory properties and in the course of this work discovered that certain compounds of the class known as thienopyridines ( compounds having a thiene ring fused to a pyridine ring ) have the property of inhibiting blood platelet aggregation
Sanofi_scientists led by Dr. Jean-Pierre Maffrand pursued this direction of research
The record states that they initially synthesized and evaluated several hundred chemical modifications and derivatives of thienopyridines seeking optimum anti-platelet aggregation properties with *1079 minimal undesirable effects
They eventually selected for development the compound having the following structural formula :

?
Sanofi gave this compound the common_name `` ticlopidine ''
After lengthy development including animal and human_trials in 1991 ticlopidine was approved in the United_States for use as an anti-thrombotic agent
This approval however was accompanied by required warnings concerning possible adverse effects for reports had been received of rarely occurring but serious blood disorders neutropenia and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura associated with prolonged usage of ticlopidine
Thus Sanofi continued its search for a product that would have the therapeutic benefits of ticlopidine but without the adverse properties
Sanofi synthesized and evaluated several hundred additional thienopyridine derivatives including a class of compounds having the following general structure wherein one of the hydrogen_atoms on the bridge_carbon_atom ( marked with an asterisk ) is replaced with an ester carboxylic acid or amide group
This class is the subject of the ¡¬596_patent ( and the counterpart Canadian ¡¬ 875 patent ) and is shown as follows :

?
X and Y can be any of a number of substituents as identified in the patents ; the district_court found that there are thirty-seven possibilities for X and 1710 choices for Y
The patents state that compounds of this class exhibit good anti-platelet aggregation properties and are well tolerated
Focusing on the ¡¬ 596 patent the specification includes twenty-one examples of specific compounds including a compound designated as PCR 4099 which Sanofi synthesized in July 1980
In PCR 4099 the substituent attached to the bridge_carbon is the methyl ester group ( -COOCH3 ) and X is chlorine in the 2-position as follows : *1080. ?
This compound has the chemical name methyl_alpha-5 ( 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro ( 3,2-c ) thieno pyridyl ) ( 2-chlorophenyl ) -acetate with the acronym MATTPCA
PCR 4099 as the hydrochloride_salt was selected for commercial_development as a potential replacement for ticlopidine in light of its improved platelet inhibition and toxicity profile
However PCR 4099 still raised toxicity concerns for at very high doses it caused convulsions in laboratory animals
Thus the research efforts continued concurrently with the clinical and commercial_development of PCR 4099
Sanofi states that about 1500 compounds in this general class were synthesized of which about 600 including PCR 4099 were chiral thienopyridines
`` Chiral '' is defined as `` describ [ ing ] asymmetric molecules that are mirror images of each other i.e. they are related like right and left hands
Such molecules are also called enantiomers and are characterized by optical activity ''
Richard J. Lewis Sr. Hawley 's Condensed Chemical Dictionary 270 ( 15th ed.2007 )

Enantiomers are spatial isomers also called stereoisomers wherein the isomeric compounds have the same_chemical_formula and the same chemical structure but differ in their orientation in three-dimensional space
Such stereoisomers can exist for all molecules that contain an asymmetric_carbon_atom
An `` asymmetric_carbon '' is a carbon_atom to which four different substituents are attached whereby due to the tetrahedral structure of carbon bonds in three dimensions the spatial_orientation of substituents attached to a carbon_atom varies
When there is only one asymmetric_carbon_atom in the molecule and thus only two stereoisomers these isomers are called enantiomers

Enantiomers are identified and distinguished by their optical characteristics when a purified solution of the separated isomers is exposed to plane-polarized light
One enantiomer will rotate plane-polarized light to the right ( and thus is called the dextrorotatory or d- or ( + ) isomer ) and the other rotates plane-polarized light to the left ( called the levorotatory or l- or ( - ) isomer )
For the compounds here at issue the asymmetric_carbon is at the bridge between the thienopyridine and the benzene components of the molecule as marked with an asterisk in the drawings shown ante
Enantiomers generally are formed in equal amounts to produce what is called a racemate ; the racemate is optically neutral

In the district_court experts for both sides explained the difficulty of separating enantiomers for they are identical except for the spatial arrangement at one of the carbon_atoms
Sanofi_scientists had previously separated the enantiomers of two thienopyridines and had found that the separated enantiomers showed no advantage over the racemates
The first such separation was conducted in 1978 for a *1081 compound designated PCR 1033 which had a methyl group in place of one of the hydrogen_atoms on the bridge_carbon of ticlopidine and whose maleate salt was found to be more potent than ticlopidine in antiplatelet_activity but had undesirable side effects
On separation it was found that one of the enantiomers of PCR 1033 was more biologically active but also more neurotoxic than the racemate
Thus separation offered no benefit for PCR 1033

About three years later Sanofi separated the enantiomers of a compound designated PCR 3233 which had an ethyl group on the bridge_carbon and was more effective in antiplatelet_activity than ticlopidine
However neither of the separated enantiomers differed in activity from the racemate and thus separation offered no benefit for PCR 3233
Sanofi witnesses testified to their belief that there was no advantage to separation of the enantiomers of thienopyridines and no other racemates were separated until in November 1985 Dr. Maffrand decided to study the enantiomers of PCR 4099

The separation for PCR 4099 was assigned to Mr. Alain Badorc the chemist who had separated the enantiomers of PCR 1033_and_3233
It was explained in the district_court that such separations are complex and time-consuming for enantiomers are identical except for the spatial_orientation about one carbon_atom and tend to have identical or almost identical chemical and physical properties
The district_court received testimony that although the chemical literature shows at least ten separation techniques that might be tried it can not be known in advance which if any technique might work

The record shows five months of experimentation by Mr._Badorc and eventually the successful separation using a technique called diastereomeric salt formation
This procedure which originated with Louis Pasteur is based on the trial of diverse salt-forming compositions and conditions in the hope of coming upon a lucky combination of reagents that will preferentially select one of the enantiomers and crystallize from the solution in optically pure form
In Mr._Badorc 's successful experiment he prepared thirty compositions of PCR 4099 and various resolving acids at various concentrations and in various solvents and after about one month crystals formed in the composition containing ( + ) camphorsulfonic acid and PCR 4099 in a 4:10 ratio dissolved in acetone
This combination eventually yielded the pure levorotatory enantiomer and isolation of the pure dextrorotatory_enantiomer followed as discussed by the district_court in Sanofi_III 492 F.Supp.2d at 372-73

Sanofi then determined the biological_properties of the enantiomers of PCR 4099 and found that they had the rare characteristic of `` absolute stereoselectivity '' : the dextrorotatory_enantiomer provided all of the favorable antiplatelet_activity but with no significant neurotoxicity while the levorotatory enantiomer produced no antiplatelet_activity but virtually all of the neurotoxicity
The experts for both sides agreed that while it was generally known that enantiomers can exhibit different biological activity this degree and kind of stereoselectivity is rare and could not have been predicted
The experts explained that in the usual case if one enantiomer is more biologically active than the other that activity includes the adverse as well as the beneficial properties

In view of these results in April 1987 Sanofi terminated commercial_development of the racemate PCR 4099 which had been proceeding since 1980 and had reached Phase I human_trials at a cost stated to be tens of millions of dollars
More years of development ensued for the dextrorotatory_enantiomer to which Sanofi gave the common *1082 name `` clopidogrel ''
Sanofi also found that the hydrochloride_salt which had been suitable for processing and tabletting the racemate PRC 4099 was not suitable for clopidogrel
After further research Sanofi found that the hydrogen sulfate salt ( also called the bisulfate ) was suitable for tabletting
FDA_approval of clopidogrel_bisulfate was achieved in the United_States in 1998 allowing introduction of the product PlavixTHE_R

Sanofi filed a patent application directed to clopidogrel and certain salts and pharmaceutical compositions in France on February 17 1987 and then in the United_States and other countries
The United_States patent is the ¡¬ 265 patent in suit
The ¡¬265 specification explains that the racemate of the same_chemical_formula was described in the earlier French ¡¬247_patent which corresponds to the earlier U.S. ¡¬596_patent
The ¡¬265_patent discusses the unusual stereoselectivity of the biological_properties as between the dextrorotatory and the levorotatory enantiomers
The United_States patent examiner who had also examined the ¡¬596_patent allowed the claims after requiring that the ¡¬265 claims make clear that the dextro and levoenantiomers are `` substantially separated ''

Apotex stipulated that claim 3 of the ¡¬265_patent is literally infringed by its product
The district_court after full trial including extensive expert testimony provided by both sides ruled that claim 3 is valid and enforceable
Apotex appeals the court 's rulings on the issues of anticipation and obviousness ; the rulings in Sanofi 's favor on the issues of unenforceability and double patenting are not appealed
