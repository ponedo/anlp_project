In this patent infringement action plaintiffs American Medical Systems Inc. and Laserscope appeal an order granting summary_judgment of noninfringement to defendant Biolitec Inc
The patent in suit Laserscope 's U.S. Patent No._6986,764 ( `` the ¡¬764_patent `` ) is entitled `` Method and System for Photoselective Vaporization of the Prostate and Other Tissue ''
It claims various_methods and devices for vaporizing tissue by using laser_radiation
The district_court based its summary_judgment order on its conclusion that Biolitec 's accused device does not perform `` photoselective_vaporization of tissue '' a term that is contained only in the preambles of the asserted claims
Because we conclude that the disputed preamble term does not limit the asserted claims we reverse and remand

*1356 I
The invention of the ¡¬764_patent can be used to treat Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia ( `` BPH '' ) a condition in which growth of the prostate gland restricts the passage of urine out of the bladder and through the urethra
Vaporization or ablation of some of the prostate_tissue reduces the size of the prostate and can relieve bladder outlet obstructions
As described in the patent this type of BPH treatment generally involves the insertion of a cytoscope into the urethra the provision of an irrigant such as sterile water and the application of high-intensity laser_radiation to the target_tissue by means of an optical_fiber

According to the specification of the ¡¬764_patent prior art tissue vaporization systems were inefficient when used with continuous irrigation and they frequently caused side effects including residual tissue coagulation i.e. the generation of a layer of thermally denatured tissue which led to swelling transient urinary retention and infection
¡¬764_patent col._2,_ll._33-41
The ineffectiveness of the prior art systems was due in part to their use of longer_wavelengths of laser_radiation such as 2100_or_1064 nanometers ( `` nm '' )
At 2100 nm the specification explains laser_radiation is `` strongly absorbed by water in the prostate_tissue '' and there is `` essentially no selective_absorption by blood ''
When combined with the pulse energies and pulse durations used in the prior art devices the use of radiation of that wavelength led to violent tissue disruption and `` poor hemostasis '' ( stoppage of bleeding )
Id. col._2,_ll._17-20 28-32
At 1064 nm the radiation is hemostatic when used at high power levels but has low absorption in blood and prostate_tissue that `` leads to inefficient ablation and a large residual layer of thermally denatured tissue several millimeters thick ''
Id. col._2,_ll._36-38
By contrast the specification explains laser_radiation at a wavelength of 532 nm `` is selectively absorbed by blood leading to good hemostasis '' and when sufficient power is used at that wavelength the process leaves behind a layer of denatured tissue less than 1 millimeter thick which reduces swelling and painful urination
Id. col._2,_ll._49-56
The specification adds however that even when using a wavelength of 532 nm prior art techniques were inefficient and caused significant residual_coagulation
Id. col._2,_ll._59-65

The inventors of the ¡¬764_patent determined that the use of high `` volumetric power density '' i.e. a high amount of energy delivered to a given volume of tissue would result in increased vaporization efficiency while minimizing residual_coagulation
The patent is directed to various_methods and devices for achieving high volumetric power density for tissue vaporization by manipulating variables such as wavelength output power beam quality irrigant composition and distance between the optical_fiber and the tissue
Those variables in turn affect the resulting irradiance level spot_size and absorption depth

Claim 31 is representative of the method claims
It recites :

A method for photoselective_vaporization of tissue comprising : delivering laser_radiation to a treatment_area on the tissue the laser_radiation having a wave-length and having irradiance in the treatment_area sufficient to cause vaporization of a substantially greater_volume of tissue than a volume of residual_coagulated_tissue caused by the laser_radiation wherein the delivered laser_radiation has an average_irradiance in the treatment_area greater than 10 kiloWatts/cm 2 in a spot_size at least 0.BIG_TOKEN__05_mm_2__BIG_TOKEN
The apparatus claims are generally similar except that they also recite a laser and an endoscope having an optical_fiber for delivering the laser_radiation

*1357 Most of the independent_claims do not specify a maximum or minimum wavelength for the laser_radiation used in the claimed methods or by the claimed apparatus although several of them have dependent claims specifying that `` the laser_radiation has a wavelength in a range from about 650 to about 200 nm ''
The other independent_claims expressly recite `` laser_radiation having a wavelength in a range of about 200 nm to about 650 nm ''
With the exception of claims 1_and_16 all of the independent_claims contain limitations requiring that the laser_radiation have a `` wavelength and irradiance in the treatment_area sufficient to cause vaporization of a substantially greater_volume of tissue than a volume of residual_coagulated_tissue caused by the laser_radiation ''
Claim 1 requires that the laser_radiation be `` absorbed substantially completely by the tissue within about 1 mm of the surface '' and that it have `` average_irradiance in the treatment_area greater than 10 kiloWatts/cm 2 in a spot_size at least about 0.BIG_TOKEN__05_mm_2__BIG_TOKEN ''
Claim 16 requires the delivery of laser_radiation and a flow of transparent liquid irrigant with the laser `` causing vaporization of a volume of tissue greater than a volume of residual_coagulation of tissue and having irradiance in the treatment_area greater than 10 kiloWatts/cm 2 in a spot_size at least about 0.BIG_TOKEN__05_mm_2__BIG_TOKEN ''

The plaintiffs filed suit against Biolitec in the United_States_District_Court for the District of Massachusetts alleging that Biolitec 's Evolve ( tm ) laser_system and method of use infringed a number of the claims of the ¡¬764_patent
The accused product is a laser-powered tissue ablation system that uses radiation having a wavelength of 980 nm
It includes an optical_fiber probe for administering the radiation by direct_contact with the target_tissue

Following a Markman hearing the district_court issued an order construing several key terms in the asserted claims
Am
Med Sys. Inc. v. Biolitec Inc. 569_F.Supp.2d_313 ( D.Mass.2008 )
Most sharply disputed were the terms in the preambles of the asserted claims : `` A method for photoselective_vaporization of tissue '' and `` An apparatus for photoselective_vaporization of tissue ''
The plaintiffs argued that the preamble language ( particularly the phrase `` photoselective_vaporization '' ) simply describes the invention as a whole and should not be construed as a limitation of any of the asserted claims
The district_court however ruled that the repeated use of the phrase `` photoselective_vaporization '' in the specification and claims indicated that `` photoselective_vaporization '' is a `` fundamental characteristic '' of the invention albeit not its central innovative feature
Id.at 320-22
The court found support for that conclusion in the patent 's discussion of the prior art
In particular the court relied on the patent 's criticism of earlier laser_systems that used longer_wavelengths of 2100 nm or 1064 nm
Those systems according to the specification produced `` low '' or `` no '' selective_absorption of the radiation by blood and tissue ; by contrast to those systems the specification praised a prior art system that used a shorter wavelength of 532 nm that was `` selectively absorbed by blood ''
Id.at 321
Accordingly the court construed the term `` photoselective_vaporization '' to mean `` using a wavelength that is highly absorptive in the tissue while being absorbed only to a negligible_degree by water or other_irrigant ''
Id.at 327

In light of the district_court 's claim_construction ruling Biolitec moved for summary_judgment of noninfringement asserting that its Evolve ( tm ) laser_system operated at a wavelength ( 980 nm ) at which the energy is absorbed to more than `` a negligible_degree by water or other_irrigant ''
The district_court granted Biolitec 's motion
Am
Med Sys. Inc. v. Biolitec Inc. 603_F.Supp.2d_251 ( D.Mass.2009 )
The *1358 court began by noting certain undisputed facts concerning the properties of 980 nm_laser_light ( as in the accused product ) as compared with 532 nm_laser_light ( the wavelength of the ¡¬764_patent 's preferred and commercial embodiment )
For example the absorption_coefficient of 980 nm_laser_energy in water is 0.43 whereas the absorption_coefficient of 532 nm_laser_energy in water is only 0.00036 ; and 4.2 % of 980 nm_laser_energy is absorbed by water at a distance of 1 mm from prostate_tissue whereas only 0.004 % of 532 nm_laser_energy is absorbed by water at that distance
Id.at 255-56
The district_court also observed that Biolitec 's accused device operates by placing the device in direct_contact with the target_tissue so as to prevent absorption of the energy by the water irrigant
In light of those facts the court concluded that `` [ w ] hen compared to 532 nm_laser_light 980 nm_laser_light is more than negligibly absorbed by the water irrigant '' and thus did not satisfy the `` photoselective_vaporization '' limitation of the ¡¬764_patent as the district_court construed it
Id.at 256
The court therefore held that Biolitec 's accused device did not literally infringe the ¡¬ 764 patent

The district_court also addressed the issue of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
The court concluded that the `` function-way-result '' test was ill-suited to evaluating the patent in suit but it held that under the `` all limitations '' rule and the corollary `` specific exclusion '' principle developed by this court Biolitec 's device did not infringe the ¡¬764_patent by equivalents
Am
Med
Sys. 603 F.Supp.2d at 257-58

On appeal the plaintiffs contend that ( 1 ) the term `` photoselective_vaporization '' in the preamble of each of the asserted claims should not be construed as a claim_limitation ; ( 2 ) if `` photoselective_vaporization '' is a limitation on the claims the district_court erred in construing that term to require a wavelength that is `` absorbed only to a negligible_degree by water or other_irrigant '' ; and ( 3 ) if the district_court 's claim_construction is correct the district_court erred in its infringement analysis in several respects
We conclude that the preamble_phrase `` photoselective_vaporization of tissue '' and particularly the descriptor `` photoselective '' does not limit the claims of the ¡¬764_patent
Therefore we need not address the plaintiffs ' remaining arguments
Because the district_court 's grant of summary_judgment was predicated entirely on its conclusion that Biolitec 's accused device `` does not violate the 'photoselective_vaporization ' claim_limitation in the ¡¬764_patent as construed in the Markman Order '' Am
Med
Sys. 603 F.Supp.2d at 256 we reverse and remand for further proceedings
