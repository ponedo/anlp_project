Background
The '800_patent for an archery_bow_sight_assembly issued to Carella on January 30 1968 on an application filed in the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( PTO ) on August 7 1967
It contains ten claims with claim 1 the only independent claim reading as follows : An archery_bow_sight_assembly comprising : support_means adapted for attachment generally parallel to the length of an archery_bow and a plurality of independent sights respectively connected to and each independently adjustable longitudinally along said support_means each of said sights defining a longitudinal_distance different from the longitudinal_distance defined by any one of the other sights so that said assembly may be attached to an archery_bow and each sight independently positioned relative to said support_means for properly aiming the bow by moving the bow to view a target at a distance from the bow through the respective sights until the apparent vertical height of the target equal the longitudinal_distance defined by one of said sights thereby properly aiming the bow for the particular target
The Carella bow sight has independently adjustable rings of calibrated sizes and a mount that permits overlapping of the rings
These features allow the Carella bow sight to be used for simultaneous range finding and aiming

Pro_Line is in the business of the manufacture distribution and sale of archery related products including bow sights
Starlight is a customer of Pro_Line but has also been a customer of Carella

Pro_Line approached Carella in 1973 and again in 1978 for a license to produce the Carella bow sight but Carella refused
Pro_Line sought advice from patent counsel in 1978_and_1980 on the validity of the Carella '800_patent
Thereafter Pro_Line manufactured and sold its Model M-525RF ( Pro_Line ) range finder hunting sight and M-5096RF ( Pro_Line ) range finder pins
The Pro_Line bow sight comprises a bracket with a single slot and a plurality of sight elements made from standard sight pins to which wire rings are threaded

On May_6,_1981 Carella filed suit against Starlight alleging that Starlight had infringed the '800_patent by selling Pro_Line sights and Pro_Line sight pins
Pro_Line intervened as a party defendant and filed counterclaims seeking a declaration of patent_invalidity and noninfringement damages and injunctive relief

In their Answer and Counterclaims appellants alleged the '800_patent was invalid because ( 1 ) the claimed invention was anticipated by U.S._Patent_No._3056,206 ( '206 ) issued to Moore and by the Schneider Rite-Flite Sight ( 2 ) the claimed invention was obvious in view of prior_art not considered by the PTO during prosecution of the '800_patent and ( 3 ) Carella procured the '800_patent by inequitable_conduct consisting of his failure to disclose to the PTO the settlement of Perkins v. Carella ( Civil No._3 1581 E.D.Mich
August 5 1968 ) a declaratory judgment action and material prior_art
Appellants also asserted that even if the '800_patent were enforceable they had not infringed the patent and if they had infringed treble_damages and attorney fees were not warranted

The district_court held the '800_patent infringed and not invalid and ordered Pro_Line to pay to Carella $ 60,466.00 in lost profits together with $ 1,663.06 in costs and prejudgment_interest ; enjoined appellants from further_acts of infringement of the '800_patent ; and dismissed Pro_Line 's counterclaims
The court declined to award treble_damages and attorneys fees
It also denied appellants ' motion for reconsideration
