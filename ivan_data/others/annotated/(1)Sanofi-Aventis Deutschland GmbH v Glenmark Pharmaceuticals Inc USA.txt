Opinion
NEWMAN Circuit_Judge
This patent_infringement_suit concerns the antihypertension drug having the brand name TarkaTHE_R
TarkaTHE_R is a combination of two active ingredients into a single dosage product : the angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor trandolapril and the calcium channel blocker ( also called `` calcium antagonist '' ) verapamil hydrochloride
The combination drug is covered by United States Patent No._5721,244 ( the ¡¬244_patent ) and is owned by or exclusively licensed to Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH ( a company of Germany ) Aventis_Pharma_S.A. ( a company of France ) ; Abbott_GmbH ( a company of Germany ) and Abbott_Laboratories and Abbott_Laboratories Inc. ( United States companies ) ( collectively `` Plaintiffs '' )

The New Drug Application ( NDA ) for the TarkaTHE_R product was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1996 and acquired by Abbott_Laboratories in 2001
In 2007 the defendants Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Glenmark_Pharmaceuticals_Ltd. ( collectively `` Glenmark '' ) filed an abbreviated new_drug_application ( ANDA ) for the generic counterpart of this product
Since the ¡¬ 244 patent had not expired Glenmark filed a Hatch-Waxman `` Paragraph IV Certification '' leading to the filing by Plaintiffs of this infringement suit

Launch of Glenmark 's generic_product was stayed for 30 months as the statute *BIG_TOKEN__1357_provides._21__BIG_TOKEN U.S.C.¡± 355 ( j ) ( 5 ) ( B ) ( iii )
After the stay expired in 2010 Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction which the district_court denied
In June 2010 Glenmark launched its generic_product `` at-risk '' while this litigation proceeded in the district_court

Trial was to a jury
Glenmark admitted infringement and the jury held that the ¡¬244_patent had not been proved invalid
The jury awarded $ 15,200,000 in lost profits and $ 803,514 in price erosion damages
Post-trial motions were denied and judgment was entered on the verdict
The district_court retained authority to assess post-verdict damages if this court sustained the judgment on appeal

Glenmark does not appeal the quantum of damages but argues ( 1 ) that the ¡¬ 244 patent is invalid ( 2 ) that Glenmark is entitled to a new trial based on a prejudicial jury instruction on evidence spoliation and ( 3 ) that no damages should be awarded due to lack of standing of the Abbott United States companies
Plaintiffs defend the judgment and also state that this court lacks jurisdiction to entertain this appeal because the district_court 's judgment was not final

We conclude that jurisdiction is proper and affirm the district_court 's judgment and related rulings.1

I
JURISDICTION
Within 30 days after the district_court denied Glenmark 's post-verdict motions Glenmark filed a notice of appeal
Plaintiffs state that this appeal is premature because the district_court did not issue a document entitled `` final_judgment '' and retained authority to award post-judgment damages ; thus Plaintiffs argue that there is no appellate jurisdiction

Glenmark responds that on September 30 2011 the district_court entered an Order that disposed of every pending claim and defense except the final calculation of damages
The Order ( 1 ) denied Glenmark 's pre-verdict Rule 50 ( a ) motion ( 2 ) denied Glenmark 's motions for post-verdict judgment as a matter of law on the issues of standing and double patenting and ( 3 ) granted Plaintiffs ' request for an injunction
ECF No._379
Glenmark timely filed a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50 ( b ) which the district_court denied
ECF No._410
Glenmark appealed within 30 days of that denial

Glenmark points out that 28 U.S.C.¡± 1292 ( c ) ( 2 ) recognizes finality for purposes of appeal although the accounting of damages may not be complete
The statute assigns the Federal_Circuit jurisdiction of : ¡± 1292 ( c ) ( 2 ) -an appeal from a judgment in a civil action for patent_infringement which would otherwise be appealable to the United_States_Court of Appeals for the Federal_Circuit and is final except for an accounting
In Robert Bosch LLC v. Pylon Mfg Corp. 719_F.3d_1305 1317 ( Fed.Cir.2013 ) ( en banc ) this court reiterated that `` an accounting '' includes the determination of damages

The jury found the damages for the period covered by the evidence at trial
The district_court 's issuance of an Order closing the case with provision for an accounting of any additional damages that *1358 may accrue if the decision is affirmed on appeal does not negate finality of a judgment that meets the terms of ¡± 1292 ( c ) ( 2 )
No `` magic words '' are needed to confer final_judgment
See Local Union No._1992 of Int ' l Bhd
of Elec
Workers v. Okonite Co. 358_F.3d_278 285 ( 3d Cir.2004 ) ( `` The order 's denomination as an 'order ' rather than a 'judgment ' does not mean that it fails to satisfy the separate document requirement '' of the final_judgment rule
) ; Hill v. Potter 352_F.3d_1142 1144 ( 7th Cir.2003 ) ( `` The test for finality is.. whether the district_court has finished with the case `` )
Glenmark is correct that the judgment was final and ripe for appeal and that this court is properly exercising jurisdiction
