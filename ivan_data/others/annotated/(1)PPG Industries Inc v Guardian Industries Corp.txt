The United_States_District_Court for the Western_District of Pennsylvania Gary L. Lancaster J. entered preliminary_injunction in favor of patentee and competitor appealed
The Court of Appeals Bryson Circuit_Judge held that : ( 1 ) competitor 's automotive_solar_control_glass which filtered ultraviolet infrared radiation could infringe patented glass even if inventor 's use of flawed testing equipment led to belief that glass having composition of competitor 's glass would not satisfy patent 's 31 % ultraviolet transmission requirement ; ( 2 ) inventors ' mistaken belief at time they applied for patent for solar_control_glass that competitor 's glass could not meet transmittance limitations in patent_claims did not establish that patent_claims did not accurately and distinctly set out what inventors regarded as their invention ; ( 3 ) patent satisfied statutory enablement requirement ; ( 4 ) sulfur content in competitor 's automotive_solar_control_glass which was not required contained in patent did not establish that competitor 's glass was not infringing ; ( 5 ) patent was not invalid on grounds of obviousness or anticipation ; ( 6 ) patentee 's showing that it was likely to prevail on issues of patent validity and infringement entitled it to presumption of irreparable_harm necessary for preliminary_injunctive_relief ; and ( 7 ) balance of hardships and public_interest favored grant of injunctive relief

Opinion
BRYSON Circuit_Judge
This case concerns a dispute between two major manufacturers of automotive glass ; the dispute revolves around glass compositions known as `` solar_control_glass '' which have the highly desirable characteristics of filtering out most of the sun 's ultraviolet and infrared radiation while transmitting most of the light in the visible part of the spectrum
Appellee PPG Industries Inc. which holds a patent on a composition of solar_control_glass sued appellant Guardian Industries Corporation for patent infringement and obtained a preliminary_injunction from the United_States_District_Court for the Western_District of Pennsylvania
The injunction prohibits Guardian from making using or selling its own composition of solar_control_glass
We conclude that the district_court did not abuse its discretion in granting preliminary_injunctive_relief to PPG and we therefore affirm the order of the district_court

I
On August 31 1993 the Patent and Trademark Office issued U.S. Patent No._5240,886 ( the '886_patent ) which was assigned to PPG
Shortly after obtaining the patent PPG advised Guardian that it believed Guardian 's solar_control_glass known as `` Solar Management Glass '' ( SMG ) infringed PPG 's rights under the patent
Litigation followed and after a five-day hearing the district_court granted PPG 's motion for a preliminary_injunction

The district_court found that PPG had established a likelihood of success on the merits by making a strong showing that SMG infringed PPG 's rights under the patent and that the patent was not invalid
In light of PPG 's showing on the merits the court held that PPG was entitled to a presumption that it would suffer irreparable_harm from Guardian 's continued infringement
The court also found that the balance of hardships and the public_interest weighed in favor of granting PPG 's request for preliminary_injunctive_relief
Guardian brought this appeal contesting the district_court 's ruling on each of those points
