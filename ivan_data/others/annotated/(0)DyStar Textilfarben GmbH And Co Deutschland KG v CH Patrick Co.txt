Opinion
MICHEL Chief_Judge
DyStar_Textilfarben_GmbH & Co. Deutschland KG ( `` DyStar '' ) sued defendants C.H
Patrick_Co. and Bann_Quimica_Ltda
( collectively `` Bann '' ) in the United_States_District_Court for the District of South_Carolina alleging direct contributory and induced_infringement of U.S. Patent No._5586,992 ( `` the ¡¬ 992 patent '' )1 which discloses a process for dyeing textile_materials with catalytically hydrogenated leuco_indigo
DyStar and Bann_Quimica_Ltda
are large chemical_manufacturers *1358 that inter alia sell prereduced indigo for use in dyeing processes ; C.H
Patrick_Co. purchased prereduced indigo_solution from Bann_Quimica_Ltda
in 2002 and used it to dye yarn in a process alleged to infringe

The parties agreed to a jury_trial before a magistrate_judge
Prior to charging the jury and in open court the magistrate_judge granted DyStar 's motion for judgment as a matter of law ( `` JMOL '' ) that it had not engaged in inequitable_conduct before the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( `` PTO '' )
The jury rendered a verdict that `` Bann Quimica and/or C.H
Patrick '' had infringed each of claims 1-4 assessed damages at $ 90,000 and declined to hold the ¡¬992_patent claims invalid for lack of enablement anticipation or obviousness

Following briefing the magistrate_judge denied Bann 's motions for JMOL or alternatively a new_trial on the question of invalidity of the ¡¬992_patent for anticipation obviousness and lack of enablement

No._6 :02-2946-WMC ( D.S.C
Nov._1,_2005 )
The magistrate_judge did not issue an opinion
His order stated : The jury diligently considered the evidence presented and found for the plaintiff
This court concludes that the jury 's verdict was reasonable and was supported by evidence in the record
Therefore as this court has great respect for trial by jury and the right of the parties to request a jury_trial this court will not substitute its findings for those of the jury as the jury 's decision was clearly supported by the trial record and was reasonable
Id

Bann appeals from the denials of its motions on anticipation and obviousness and the grant of JMOL to DyStar regarding inequitable_conduct
For the reasons explained below we reverse the district court 's denial of Bann 's motion for JMOL of invalidity of claims 1-4 for obviousness

I. Indigo has been used in dyeing textile_materials for thousands of years
Because indigo pigment is insoluble in water it must be de-oxidized or `` reduced '' to a water-soluble white form known as `` leuco_indigo '' before it can be used in dyeing
Leuco indigo is unstable ; it oxidizes and returns to its blue_pigment_form when exposed to oxygen
Thus leuco_indigo_solution needs to be kept in an oxygen-free environment or otherwise stabilized if it is not being used immediately for dyeing

For many years dyehouses commonly reduced indigo in-house through a process known as hydrosulfite_reduction
Dyers created a `` stock_vat '' in which indigo is reduced in water with sodium_hydrosulfite and solubilized with an alkali e.g. sodium hydroxide
The resulting leuco_indigo_solution is then transferred into a feed tank and fed into the dyebath
After the dyebath is prepared the textile_material is dyed through a process known as `` dipping '' and `` skying ''
In `` dipping '' the textile_material is contacted with leuco_indigo in the dyebath ; in `` skying '' the dyed textile_material is introduced to the air causing the indigo to convert back to its blue_pigment_form

A second common method of indigo reduction catalytic_hydrogenation was patented by Andre Brochet in 1917
See U.S. Patent No._1247,927 ( `` Brochet '' )
The superficial difference between hydrosulfite_reduction and catalytic_hydrogenation is that the latter uses gaseous hydrogen *1359 rather than sodium_hydrosulfite as a reducing agent
Catalytic hydrogenation allowed `` economical production of concentrated solutions of leuco derivatives free from impurities and mineral salts '' ; when left to settle the solution naturally separates from nickel or another catalytic metal and can be `` drawn off and is ready for use ''
Brochet ll.88-90 109-110
Most important to the dyehouses however was the fact that Brochet 's leuco_indigo_solution could be stabilized in solid form usually powder or paste and coated with molasses or glue to protect the reduced indigo from air and prevent premature oxidation
This allowed the indigo reduction process to shift out of the dyehouses and into chemical_manufacturers which began to produce and sell prereduced indigo to dyehouses in the early 1900s
Rather than create a stock_vat dyers needed only to dissolve the prereduced indigo into a preparation_tank add caustic_soda ( i.e. sodium hydroxide ) and sodium_hydrosulfite to remove oxygen from the water and transfer the resulting solution from the preparation_tank to the dyebath
This significantly reduced the time necessary to prepare a dyebath the dyehouses ' expenditures on sodium_hydrosulfite and caustic_soda and the level of pollution in dyehouse waste water and on dyehouse floors

The process of dyeing textile_materials with catalytically hydrogenated leuco_indigo traditionally has involved six steps : ( 1 ) reducing indigo to its leuco form in solution ; ( 2 ) stabilizing the leuco_indigo_solution usually in paste or powder_form ; ( 3 ) creating a preparation_tank in which the dried leuco_indigo is re-converted to solution form ; ( 4 ) adding the solution to the dyebath ; ( 5 ) dipping ; and ( 6 ) skying

Claim 1 of the ¡¬992_patent the only independent claim at issue recites : A process for dyeing cellulose-containing textile_material with indigo which comprises
a ) introducing into a dyebath an aqueous solution of leuco_indigo_solution prepared by catalytic_hydrogenation ; b ) contacting the textile_material with the dyebath ; and after the leuco_indigo has gone onto the textile_material c ) converting said leuco_indigo back into the pigment form in a conventional manner by air oxidation
'992_patent col.6 l.66-col.7 l.6
The ¡¬992_patent thus improved upon the prior art by eliminating steps two and three of the traditional process : stabilizing the leuco_indigo_solution into a paste or powder_form and then reconstituting the solution in a preparation_tank
Instead it allowed a dyer to pour prereduced indigo_solution directly into a dyebath and commence dyeing immediately
