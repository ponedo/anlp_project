No._06-1329
| June_28,_2007
Synopsis
Background : Owner of patent for diabetes drug brought infringement actions against proposed manufacturers of generic versions
The United_States_District_Court for the Southern_District of New_York Denise Cote J. 417_F.Supp.2d_341 granted judgment for owner
Manufacturers appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Lourie Circuit_Judge held that :

person of ordinary_skill in the art would not have selected closest_prior_art_compound as lead_compound for antidiabetic treatment ;

person of ordinary_skill in the art would not have been prompted to modify closest_prior_art_compound using steps of homologation or ring-walking to synthesize claimed compound ; and

any error was harmless that district_court may have committed by incorrectly implying that prosecution histories were not accessible to public

Affirmed

LOURIE Circuit_Judge
Alphapharm Pty. Ltd. and Genpharm Inc. ( collectively `` Alphapharm '' ) appeal from the decision of the United_States_District_Court for the Southern_District of New_York following a bench_trial that U.S._Patent 4,687,777 was not shown to be invalid under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103
Takeda Chem Indus. Ltd. v. Mylan Labs. 417_F.Supp.2d_341 ( S.D.N.Y.2006 )
Because we conclude that the district_court did not err in determining that the claimed compounds would not have been obvious in light of the prior_art and hence that the patent has not been shown to be invalid we affirm

BACKGROUND
Diabetes is a disease that is characterized by the body 's inability to regulate blood_sugar
It is generally caused by inadequate levels of insulin-a hormone produced in the pancreas
Insulin allows blood_sugar or glucose which is derived from food to enter into the body 's cells and be converted into energy
There are two types of diabetes known as Type 1 and Type 2
In Type 1 diabetes the pancreas fails to produce insulin and individuals suffering from this type of diabetes must regularly receive insulin from an external source
In contrast Type 2 diabetic_individuals produce insulin
However their bodies are unable to effectively use the insulin that is produced
This is also referred to as insulin_resistance
As a result glucose is unable to enter the cells thereby depriving the body of its main source of energy
Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes-affecting over 90 % of diabetic_individuals

In the 1990s a class of drugs known as thiazolidinediones ( `` TZDs '' ) was introduced on the market as a treatment for Type 2 diabetes
Takeda Chemical Industries Ltd. and Takeda_Pharmaceuticals_North_America Inc. ( collectively `` Takeda '' ) first invented certain TZDs in the 1970s
Takeda 's research revealed that TZDs acted as insulin sensitizers i.e. compounds that ameliorate insulin_resistance
Although the function of TZDs was not completely understood TZDs appeared to lower blood glucose levels by binding to a molecule in the nucleus of the cell known as PPARgamma which activates insulin receptors and stimulates the production of glucose transporters
Takeda 417 F.Supp.2d at 348-49
The transporters then travel to the cellular surface and enable glucose to enter the cell from the bloodstream
Id

Takeda developed the drug ACTOSTHE_R which is used to control blood_sugar in patients who suffer from Type 2 diabetes
ACTOSTHE_R has enjoyed substantial commercial success since its launch in 1999
By *1353 2003 it held 47 % of the TZD market and gross sales for that year exceeded $ 1.7 billion
Id.at 386
The active ingredient in ACTOSTHE_R is the TZD compound pioglitazone a compound claimed in the patent in suit

Takeda owns U.S._Patent 4,687,777 ( the `` ¡¬777_patent `` ) entitled `` Thiazolidinedione Derivatives Useful As Antidiabetic Agents ''
The patent is directed to `` compounds which can be practically used as antidiabetic agents having a broad safety margin between pharmacological effect and toxicity or unfavorable side reactions ''
¡¬777_patent col.1 ll.34-37
The asserted claims are claims 1 2 and 5
Claim 1 claims a genus of compounds
Claim 5 claims pharmaceutical compositions containing that genus of compounds
Those claims read as follows : 1
A compound of the formula :

?
or a pharmacologically acceptable_salt thereof
5
An antidiabetic composition which consists essentially of a compound of the formula : ?
or a pharmacologically acceptable_salt thereof in association with a pharmacologically acceptable carrier excipient or diluent
Id. claims 1 & 5
For purposes of this appeal the critical portion of the compound structure is the left_moiety of the molecule namely the ethyl-substituted pyridyl_ring.1 That chemical_structure which has an ethyl substituent ( C2 H5 ) pictorially drawn to the center of the pyridyl_ring indicates that the structure covers four possible compounds viz. compounds with an ethyl substituent located at the four available positions on the pyridyl_ring
Takeda 417 F.Supp.2d at 360
The formula includes the 3-ethyl compound 4-ethyl compound 5-ethyl compound ( pioglitazone ) and 6-ethyl compound

*BIG_TOKEN__1354_Claim_2__BIG_TOKEN of the ¡¬777_patent covers the single compound pioglitazone
That claim which depends from claim 1 reads : 2
A compound as claimed in claim 1 wherein the compound is 5- { 4- [ 2- ( 5-ethyl-2-pyridyl ) ethoxy ] benzyl } -2,4-thiazolidinedione
¡¬777_patent claim 2
Pioglitazone is referred to as the 5-ethyl compound_because the ethyl substituent is attached to the 5-position on the pyridyl_ring
That portion of the compound is depicted as :

?
Alphapharm a generic drug manufacturer filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application ( `` ANDA '' ) pursuant to the Hatch-Waxman Act seeking U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( `` FDA '' ) approval under 21 U.S.C.¡± 355 ( j ) et seq
to manufacture and sell a generic version of pioglitazone
Alphapharm filed a Paragraph IV certification with its ANDA pursuant to ¡± 505 ( j ) ( 2 ) ( B ) ( ii ) asserting that the ¡¬777_patent is invalid as obvious under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103
In response Takeda sued Alphapharm along with three other generic drug manufacturers who also sought FDA approval to market generic pioglitazone alleging that the defendants have infringed or will infringe the ¡¬777_patent

On January 17 2006 the district_court commenced a bench_trial solely on the issues of validity and enforceability of the ¡¬777_patent
Alphapharm advanced its invalidity argument asserting that the claimed compounds would have been obvious at the time of the alleged invention
Alphapharm 's obviousness contention rested entirely on a prior_art TZD compound that is referenced in Table 1 of the ¡¬777_patent as compound_b
The left_moiety of compound_b consists of a pyridyl_ring with a methyl ( CH3 ) group attached to the 6-position of the ring
That portion of its chemical_structure is illustrated as follows :

?
Alphapharm asserted that the claimed compounds would have been obvious over compound_b

The district_court found that Alphapharm failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the asserted claims were invalid as obvious under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103
The court first concluded that there was no motivation in the prior_art to select compound_b as the lead_compound for antidiabetic research and that the prior_art taught away from its use
As such the court concluded that Alphapharm failed to make a prima_facie_case of obviousness
The court continued its analysis and found that even if Alphapharm succeeded in making a prima facie showing Takeda would still prevail because any prima_facie_case of obviousness was rebutted by the unexpected results of pioglitazone 's nontoxicity
The court then rendered judgment in favor of Takeda
The district_court also held that the ¡¬777_patent had not been procured though inequitable conduct
That decision has been separately appealed and has been affirmed in a decision issued today

Alphapharm timely appealed
We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
