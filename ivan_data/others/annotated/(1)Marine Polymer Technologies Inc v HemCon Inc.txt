Synopsis
Background : Patentee sued competitor for allegedly infringing patent for polymer that promoted hemostasis stopping bleeding or hemorrhage
The United_States_District_Court for the District of New_Hampshire Joseph A. DiClerico Jr. J. 2008_WL_1995454 construed patent subsequently granted patentee_summary_judgment of literal infringement and after jury_verdict in favor of patentee on invalidity defenses of anticipation and obviousness 2010_WL_3070197 granted patentee_summary_judgment on competitor 's inequitable conduct defense then entered judgment awarding patentee $ 29,410,246 damages as reasonable royalties for past infringement and permanently enjoined future infringement and 2010_WL_3120051 denied competitor 's motion for judgment as matter of law
Competitor appealed
The Court of Appeals Dyk Circuit_Judge 659_F.3d_1084 reversed judgment on infringement vacated injunction and damages_award and remanded upon concluding that competitor had acquired intervening rights based on patentee 's actions during parallel_reexamination_proceeding
Subsequently the Court of Appeals 2012_WL_255331 vacated appellate judgment and granted rehearing en banc

Holdings : The Court of Appeals en banc Lourie Circuit_Judge held that :

for an equally divided court claim was correctly construed ;

for an equally divided court substantial_evidence supported jury 's damages_award ;

intervening rights do not apply to claims that have not been amended and are not new ; and

competitor did not acquire intervening rights to patent

Affirmed

LOURIE Circuit_Judge
Defendant-Appellant HemCon Inc. ( `` HemCon '' ) appeals from a judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the District of New_Hampshire holding that HemCon infringed U.S. Patent 6,864,245 ( `` the ¡¬245_patent `` ) assigned to Plaintiff-Appellee Marine_Polymer Technologies Inc. ( `` Marine_Polymer '' )
On September 26 2011 a panel of this court reversed the district_court 's decision concluding that HemCon had acquired intervening rights in the ¡¬245_patent based on actions taken by Marine_Polymer during a parallel_reexamination_proceeding
Marine_Polymer_Techs. Inc. v. HemCon Inc. 659_F.3d_1084 ( Fed.Cir.2011 ) ( `` Panel_Opinion `` ) vacated 475_Fed.Appx._315 2012_WL_255331 ( Fed.Cir
Jan. 20 2012 )
Upon reconsideration en banc we affirm the judgment of the district_court by an equally divided court
Although the district_court did not have the reexamination before it or decide the effect of that issue on its decision we also consider HemCon 's arguments with respect to the reexamination and a majority of this court concludes as an alternative ground for affirmance that intervening rights do not apply to claims that have not been amended and are not new

BACKGROUND
Marine_Polymer owns the ¡¬245_patent which discloses and claims preparations of poly-£]-1¡÷4-N-acetylglucosamine ( `` p-GlcNAc '' ) a naturally occurring polysaccharide polymer produced by organisms such as arthropods fungi and microalgae
Purified p-GlcNAc has utility in various industrial pharmaceutical and bio-medical applications
For example p-GlcNAc promotes hemostasis ( i.e. stoppage of bleeding or hemorrhage ) and is therefore useful in trauma units for treating serious wounds

The ¡¬245_patent places particular emphasis on `` biocompatible '' compositions of p-GlcNAc
In this context biocompatibility relates to a compound 's biological_reactivity or tendency to elicit deleterious reactions-e.g. necrosis erythema edema cellular degeneration-upon exposure to living cells or tissues
E.g. ¡¬245_patent col.42 ll.36-38 col.44 ll.15-16
The specification describes four tests that can be used to assess the biocompatibility of a substance : an elution_test an implantation_test an intracutaneous_injection_test and a systemic_injection_test
Id
col.42 ll.1-3
*1355 The disclosed elution_test involves exposing a test_substance to a solution to create an extract exposing cultured test cells to the extract and then observing the cells for signs of cytotoxicity
See id
col.42 ll.6-62
The implantation_test involves implanting a sample of the test_substance into an animal 's muscle tissue and scoring the severity of any adverse local reactions
See id
col.42 l.64-col.43 l.64
The intracutaneous_injection_test calls for preparing an extract of the test_substance injecting small volumes of the extract into the skin of an animal and monitoring the injection sites for reactivity
See id
col.43 l.65-col.44 l.56
Finally in the systemic_injection_test animals are monitored for weight changes and other overt signs of toxicity after receiving intravenous or intraperitoneal injections of a test_substance extract
See id
col.44 l.57-col.45 l.42

In describing these biocompatibility_tests the specification indicates that their requirements are met if a given test_substance shows no more than mild or slight_reactivity
For example scores on the elution_test range from zero to four on a scale of biological_reactivity where zero represents no reactivity one represents slight_reactivity two represents mild_reactivity and three or four represent moderate or severe reactivity respectively and a substance can satisfy the elution_test `` if none of the cultures treated with the test article show a greater than mild_reactivity ''
Id
col.42 ll.41-62
But with regard to the claimed p-GlcNAc compositions the specification also states that `` the p-GlcNAc of the invention exhibits no detectable_biological_reactivity as assayed by elution_tests intramuscular implantation in rabbits intracutaneous injection in rabbits and systemic injections in mice ''
Id
col.41 l.66-col.42 l.3 ; see also col.45 l.44-col.49 l.66 ( reporting biocompatibility test results for p-GlcNAc showing zero reactivity on each test )

The ¡¬245_patent issued with 22 claims all of which recite `` biocompatible '' compositions of p-GlcNAc
A majority of those claims recite the `` biocompatible '' limitation generically
Independent claim 6 is representative : A biocompatible_poly-£]-1¡÷4-N-acetylglucosamine comprising up to about 150,000 N-acetylglucosamine monosaccharides covalently attached in a £]-1¡÷4 conformation and having a molecular weight of up to about 30 million daltons in which at least one N-acetylglucosamine monosaccharide has been deacetylated
Id
col.72 ll.5-10 ( emphasis added )
In addition the ¡¬245_patent contains several dependent_claims that recite specific scores on the elution_test
For example claim 12 claims : `` The biocompatible_poly-£]-1¡÷4-N-acetylglucosamine of any one of claims 6-11 which has an elution_test score of 0 ''
Id
col.72 ll.33-35 ( emphasis added )
Claims 3_and_20 also specify zero scores on the elution_test ; analogous claims 4 5 13 14 21 and 22 require elution_test_scores of one or two
E.g. id
col.72 ll.33-41

Marine_Polymer sued HemCon in March 2006 alleging that HemCon infringed the ¡¬ 245 patent
During subsequent Markman proceedings Marine_Polymer argued that `` biocompatible '' p-GlcNAc should be construed to mean `` biomedically pure [ p-GlcNAc ] that reproducibly exhibits acceptably low levels of adverse bioreactivity as determined by biocompatibility_tests ''
Marine_Polymer_Techs. Inc. v. HemCon Inc. No._06- CV-100 2008_WL_1995454 at *1 ( D.N.H
May_6,_2008 )
HemCon countered that `` biocompatible '' should be read as limiting the claims to p-GlcNAc that had been `` harvested from plant microalgae '' or in the alternative should be interpreted broadly to mean `` suited for biomedical applications ''
Id.at *1-2
The district_court considered and ultimately *1356 rejected each of the parties ' proposed constructions after reviewing the ¡¬245_patent 's claim language written description and prosecution history
Instead the district_court concluded that `` biocompatible '' p-GlcNAc as claimed in the ¡¬245_patent means p-GlcNAc `` with low_variability high_purity and no detectable_biological_reactivity as determined by biocompatibility_tests ''
Id.at *10

Marine_Polymer then moved for summary judgment that HemCon literally infringed claims 6 7 10-12 17 and 20 of the ¡¬245_patent
Applying its claim construction the district_court granted Marine_Polymer 's motion and held that HemCon had infringed all seven asserted claims
A jury trial followed to determine validity and damages
The jury made factual_findings relating to obviousness and determined that the ¡¬245_patent was not anticipated by the cited prior_art
With respect to damages the jury found that Marine_Polymer was entitled to a reasonable royalty of $ 29,410,246
After the jury_verdict HemCon filed motions for judgment as a matter of law ( `` JMOL '' ) on anticipation on the jury 's factual_findings relating to obviousness and challenging the damages_award as not supported by substantial_evidence
The district_court denied each of the motions and made a further legal determination that the asserted claims were not obvious under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103
The district_court entered a permanent_injunction on September 16 2010 barring HemCon from further infringement of the asserted claims and issued its final_judgment on September 22 2010
HemCon appealed the decision to this court

In August 2009 while the infringement litigation was still before the district_court HemCon filed a request for ex parte reexamination of the ¡¬ 245 patent in the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( `` PTO '' )
HemCon 's reexamination_request cited ten prior_art_references-all of which according to HemCon raised substantial new questions of patentability for the ¡¬245_patent given the construction of `` biocompatible '' adopted by the district_court
J.A
40740-41
In response the PTO granted HemCon 's reexamination_request initiated reexamination proceedings and issued a non-final office action on April_1,_20103 In this first office action the examiner adopted a construction of `` biocompatible '' different from the district_court 's concluding that under its broadest reasonable interpretation the term meant `` low_variability high_purity and little or no detectable reactivity ''
J.A
39503 ( emphasis added )
Noting that dependent_claims 4 5 13 14 21 and 22 of the ¡¬245_patent required elution_test_scores of one or two ( corresponding to slight or mild_reactivity on that test as defined in the specification ) the examiner explained that the district_court 's construction requiring `` no detectable_biological_reactivity '' conflicted with those claims while his interpretation avoided such inconsistency
The examiner then rejected all of the original 22 claims as invalid under his broader construction in light of the cited prior_art
In so doing he relied primarily on three prior_art_references-a scientific article ( Sandford ) and two patents ( Peniston and Malette ) -finding that each reference explicitly disclosed nearly all of the limitations of every claim
With respect to the `` biocompatible '' limitation the examiner explained that any difference between the claimed biocompatibility and that disclosed by Sandford Peniston and Malette was `` minor '' and would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art at the *1357 time of the invention
J.A
39507 ; see also 39517 39522

In response Marine_Polymer addressed `` the improper dependency noted by the Examiner '' by cancelling all six claims that had recited elution_test_scores of one or two ( i.e. claims that expressly required at least some reactivity ) while leaving each of the remaining claims 1-3 6-12 and 15-20 unaltered
Having deleted the inconsistent claims Marine_Polymer argued that `` the [ district_court 's ] interpretation of the term 'biocompatible ' should be adopted in this reexamination '' in view of various consistent teachings within the specification
J.A
37688-90
With all conflicting claims cancelled the examiner `` agree [ d ] with the [ district ] court 's construction of the term biocompatible as derived from the specification of the.. ¡¬245_patent ''
J.A
39481
Furthermore the examiner withdrew all rejections in view of that narrower construction and confirmed the remaining claims as patentable
Id

The PTO did not provide notice of its intent to issue a reexamination certificate for the ¡¬245_patent until November 3 2010 after the district_court had entered final_judgment in Marine_Polymer 's infringement action
HemCon timely appealed from the district_court 's judgment and on November 18 2010 a motions panel of this court granted a stay of the damages_award and permanent_injunction pending appeal
On March_29,_2011 the PTO issued the final reexamination certificate ( `` ¡¬245_Reexam
Cert
`` ) which cancelled dependent_claims 4 5 13 14 21 and 22 and confirmed the patentability of claims 1-3 6-12 and 15-20 in accordance with the examiner 's decision

col.2 ll.1-6

A panel of this court heard oral arguments in HemCon 's appeal from the district_court 's judgment on June_7,_2011 and issued a decision on September 26 2011 in which a majority reversed the district_court 's judgment on infringement and vacated the injunction and the damages_award on grounds that HemCon had acquired intervening rights during reexamination of the ¡¬245_patent
Panel_Opinion 659 F.3d at 1090-95
Marine_Polymer petitioned for en banc rehearing and on January 20 2012 the full court granted Marine_Polymer 's petition for rehearing and vacated the judgment of the panel
