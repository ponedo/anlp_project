* Synopsis
Patent_holder brought action against licensee alleging infringement and breach of licensing agreement
The United States District Court for the Northern District of California Vaughn R. Walker J. granted judgment for licensee
Patent_holder appealed
The Court of Appeals Bryson Circuit_Judge held that : ( 1 ) fact_issue existed as to whether particular_experiment was material ; ( 2 ) district_court committed clear_error by finding clear and convincing_evidence of intent to deceive in inventors ' failure to disclose particular_experiment to patent examiner ; ( 3 ) inventors failure to disclose purification and sizing experiments of Thermus_aquaticus ( Taq ) bacterium was not material omission ; ( 4 ) district_court 's finding was clearly erroneous that inventors ' knowledge of hydrophobicity of Taq_bacterium was material to determining whether prior art sizing experiment was accurate ; ( 5 ) fact_issue existed as to whether alleged misrepresentation or omission associated with internal memorandum of employee was material to issue associated with respective molecular_weights of prior art and purified thermostable enzyme claimed in patent ; and ( 6 ) district_court 's finding that inventors committed inequitable_conduct by erroneously stating that they performed particular purification protocol and had obtained certain results was supported by evidence and could not be deemed clearly erroneous

I
The polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) allows scientists beginning with a small amount of deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) to generate many copies of that DNA in a *1358 short period of time
The ability of PCR to synthesize DNA rapidly has led to significant advances in molecular biology and has been particularly useful in pathology and in the identification of trace materials such as blood and hair

In the first stage of PCR a segment of DNA is separated at high temperature into its two component strands
Then at a lower temperature small pieces of synthetic DNA called `` primers '' are annealed to specific locations on the separated strands
Enzymes known as DNA_polymerases then `` extend '' the primers by attaching a complementary nucleotide to each nucleotide in the template strand
In this manner the polymerase creates two identical double-stranded DNA helices from the two separated single strands of the original helix
The process of strand_separation primer annealment and extension is then performed repeatedly resulting in the production of a large number of identical DNA strands

When PCR was first developed the high_temperatures associated with strand_separation destroyed the polymerase that was used to drive the reaction
Accordingly new polymerase had to be added at the beginning of each cycle of the reaction which was cumbersome
It was subsequently discovered that the DNA_polymerase of the Thermus_aquaticus or `` Taq '' bacterium which is found in geysers and hot springs was stable and active at high_temperatures and therefore could withstand the rigors of PCR
Thus Taq needed to be added to the reaction mixture only once which resulted in making the PCR process much faster and more efficient

On June_17,_1987 Cetus Corporation the predecessor of appellants Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. and Roche_Molecular_Systems Inc. ( collectively `` Roche '' ) filed U.S. Patent Application No._07 /063,509 ( `` the ¡¬509_application '' ) which was directed to a purified thermostable enzyme
The ¡¬509_application named Dr. David Gelfand the Cetus scientist most knowledgeable about the Taq_enzyme and Ms. Susanne Stoffel Dr. Gelfand 's technician as inventors
The broadest originally filed claim was not limited to the Taq_enzyme

In an office action dated November 1 1988 the examiner rejected all the submitted claims on a variety of grounds
The rejections included an anticipation/obviousness rejection based on journal articles by Chien et_al. and Kaledin et_al. both of which disclosed a DNA_polymerase derived from the Taq_bacterium
The examiner noted that the applicants included molecular_weight limitations in dependent claims and that those limitations differed from the estimates of Taq 's molecular_weight reported by Chien and Kaledin
The examiner suggested that `` some proteins behave anomalously when subjected to SDS page '' the technique used by the applicants to estimate molecular_weight
For that reason the examiner concluded that `` [ i ] t is not clear whether or not the molecular_weight an [ d ] pH range of activity claimed by applicants for the instant enzyme is a result of experimental parameters or an enzyme activity different than the [ enzyme ] previously described in the literature ''

On March_17,_1989 the inventors responded to the examiner 's rejection canceling all pending claims and entering three new claims the broadest of which provided as follows : 1
Purified thermostable Thermus_aquaticus DNA_polymerase that migrates on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel faster than phosphorylase B and more slowly than does bovine serum albumin and has an estimated molecular_weight of 86,000-90,000 daltons when compared with a phosphorylase B standard *1359 assigned a molecular_weight of 92,500 daltons
U.S._Patent_No._4889,818 col._44,_ll._46-52

In remarks accompanying the amendment the applicants made a two-part argument for patentability
First they asserted that the claimed enzyme was distinct from the prior_art_enzyme citing differences in molecular_weight specific_activity and fidelity
Second they contended that even if contrary to their belief the claimed and prior_art_enzymes were identical the claimed enzyme would still be patentable because it was `` far more pure '' than the enzyme of the Chien and Kaledin preparations
To support that assertion the inventors cited a portion of the application indicating that the claimed enzyme had a specific_activity ten times that of the prior_art_enzyme

The examiner allowed the amended claims without further comment
The ¡¬509_application therefore issued as U.S._Patent_No._4889,818 ( `` the ¡¬818_patent `` ) on December 26 1989

Cetus licensed the ¡¬818_patent to Promega Corporation in June 1990
After Cetus sold the ¡¬818_patent to Roche Promega allegedly breached the license agreement
Roche filed suit alleging patent infringement and breach of contract
Promega counterclaimed asserting inter alia that the ¡¬818_patent was unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct a claim that soon became the focus of the litigation

In August 1996 the district_court held on summary judgment that the inventors had made four material misrepresentations during the prosecution of the ¡¬818_patent
After a bench trial the court held that the ¡¬818_patent was unenforceable based on eight separate misrepresentations and omissions including three of the ones the court had addressed at the summary judgment stage
Roche appeals the court 's order holding the patent unenforceable

II
A party seeking to have a patent declared unenforceable has a heavy burden to meet
Inequitable conduct requires misrepresentation or omission of a material fact together with an intent to deceive the PTO
Both of those distinct elements must be shown by clear and convincing_evidence
See Manville Sales Corp. v. Paramount Sys. Inc. 917_F.2d_544 552 16_USPQ2d_1587 1593 ( Fed.Cir.1990 ) ; Kingsdown Med Consultants Ltd. v. Hollister Inc. 863_F.2d_867 872 9_USPQ2d_1384 1389 ( Fed.Cir.1988 )
Once the requisite levels of materiality and intent are shown the district_court must determine whether the equities warrant a conclusion that the patentee has engaged in inequitable_conduct
Molins PLC v. Textron Inc. 48_F.3d_1172 1178 33_USPQ2d_1823 1827 ( Fed.Cir.1995 )

While it is difficult to prove inequitable_conduct a district_court 's ruling on inequitable_conduct is reviewed deferentially
The court 's findings on materiality and intent are reviewed for clear_error and thus will not be overturned in the absence of a `` definite and firm conviction '' that a mistake has been made
Molins 48 F.3d at 1178 33 USPQ2d at 1827
The district_court 's assessment of the equities is reviewed for an abuse of discretion
Id

The district_court in this case based its inequitable_conduct ruling on its finding that the inventors made various material misrepresentations and related omissions which can be grouped into three categories : ( 1 ) representations regarding the difference in molecular_weight between the claimed and prior art Taq_enzymes ; ( 2 ) representations that the inventors had performed Example VI one of the procedures described in the specification and that they had achieved the described results ; and ( 3 ) representations concerning the comparative fidelity and template dependence *1360 of the claimed enzyme and the prior_art_enzymes

We analyze each of the three categories of asserted inequitable_conduct below upholding the district_court 's findings as to two of the three and overturning the court 's findings as to the third
The dissent which would overturn the district_court 's findings with respect to all three categories criticizes us for failing to apply the clear and convincing standard of proof in assessing the evidence of materiality and intent
While we recognize the standard of proof that applies to those factual issues we also note that our task as a reviewing court is not to make those factual determinations in the first instance but to determine whether the district_court 's findings on those issues are clearly erroneous or are infected with legal error
With that standard of review in mind we turn to each of the grounds on which the district_court based its ruling
