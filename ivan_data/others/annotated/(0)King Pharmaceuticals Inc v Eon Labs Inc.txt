Before BRYSON GAJARSA and PROST Circuit_Judges
Opinion
GAJARSA Circuit_Judge
King Pharmaceuticals Inc. and King_Pharmaceuticals_Research and Development Inc. ( `` King '' ) appeal the U.S. District Court for the Eastern_District of New_York 's grant of Eon_Labs Inc. 's ( `` Eon '' ) motion for summary_judgment that all claims of U.S. Patent Nos._6407,128 ( the `` ¡¬128_patent `` ) and 6,683,102 ( the `` ¡¬102_patent `` ) are invalid
See King_Pharms. Inc. v. Eon_Labs Inc. 593_F.Supp.2d_501 ( E.D.N.Y.2009 )
In granting Eon 's motion the district_court held four claims invalid under 35 U.S.C.¡± 101 three claims invalid under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103 and the remaining claims invalid under 35 U.S.C.¡± 102
See id.at 506-15

*1270 Following the summary_judgment order the district_court entered a final_judgment against both King and Elan_Pharmaceuticals Inc. ( `` Elan '' ) a prior owner of one of the asserted patents and a third-party counterclaim_defendant
Elan filed a `` cautionary '' notice of appeal on July_2,_2009 contending that the district_court lacked jurisdiction to enter a final_judgment against it
Elan then moved to be dismissed as a party from this appeal for lack of subject_matter_jurisdiction and to vacate the district_court 's judgment as to Elan
A Federal Circuit motions panel denied the motion because the jurisdictional facts went to the merits of the case
Elan reasserts its jurisdictional arguments in the present appeal

For the reasons stated below we affirm the district_court 's grant of summary_judgment of invalidity
We vacate the district_court 's invalidity order against Elan because the district_court lacked subject_matter_jurisdiction to adjudicate the invalidity counterclaim

BACKGROUND
King markets and sells a name brand version of metaxalone called Skelaxin
Metaxalone is a muscle relaxant that is used to treat `` discomforts associated with acute painful musculosketal_conditions ''
¡¬128_patent col.1 ll.21-23
Metaxalone was first discovered in the 1960s and the first patent claiming the method of producing the compound U.S. Patent No._3062,827 issued in 1962 to A.H. Robins Company Inc. A.H. Robins began selling metaxalone under the brand name Skelaxin in 1962
Elan eventually acquired the rights to Skelaxin and sold those rights in 2003 to King which now markets and sells Skelaxin

On August 31 2004 Eon filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application ( `` ANDA '' ) for a generic 800 mg_metaxalone_tablet
Eon filed with the ANDA a patent certification pursuant to 21 U.S.C.¡± 355 ( j ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ( vii ) ( IV ) ( `` Paragraph_IV_Certification '' ) which alleged that none of the claims of the ¡¬128_patent would be infringed by the manufacture use or sale of Eon 's generic 800 mg_metaxalone_tablet and that all the claims of the ¡¬128_patent are invalid
In response to the ANDA and Paragraph_IV_Certification King filed suit against Eon under the Hatch-Waxman Act ( the `` 800 mg_Action '' )
The complaint accused Eon of infringing the ¡¬128 and ¡¬102_patent s. King 's action was consolidated with an earlier related action Elan_Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Eon_Labs Inc. No._03-0006 ( E.D.N.Y )
( the `` 400 mg_Action '' ) that Elan filed in 2001 against Eon after Eon filed an ANDA for a generic 400 mg_metaxalone_tablet
Elan asserted the ¡¬128_patent in the 400 mg_Action but the case was dismissed after Eon withdrew its 400 mg ANDA
The district_court then severed Eon 's claims for attorneys fees against King and Elan and consolidated those claims with the 800 mg_Action

The ¡¬128_patent titled `` Method for Increasing the Bioavailability of Metaxalone '' issued on June_18,_2002 and was initially assigned to Elan
Elan subsequently assigned the ¡¬128_patent to King in 2003
The patent discloses a method of `` increasing the bioavailability of metaxalone by administration of an oral_dosage_form with food ''
¡¬128_patent [ Abstract ]
The claimed invention is the result of `` the unexpected finding that administration of metaxalone with food increases both the rate and extent of absorption via the oral_dosage_form in human subjects ''
Id.at col.2 ll.6-9

The ¡¬128_patent has three independent_claims claims 1 9 and 17
Claim 1 claims `` a method of increasing the oral_bioavailability of metaxalone '' by `` administering to the patient a therapeutically effective_amount of metaxalone in a pharmaceutical_composition with food ''
Claim 9 claims a *1271 method for increasing `` the rate and extent of absorption.. of metaxalone.. in the blood stream '' by `` administering to the patient a therapeutically effective_amount of metaxalone in a pharmaceutical_composition with food ''
Claim 17 claims a method similar to claim 1 but limits the effective_amount of metaxalone to between 400_and_800 mg and defines an increase in bioavailability as `` an increase in the maximal plasma concentration ( Cmax ) and extent of absorption ( AUC ( last ) ) of metaxalone compared to administration without food ''

Dependent_claims 2 3 10 and 11 specify that the `` therapeutically effective_amount '' of metaxalone is `` 200 mg to 900 mg '' ( claims 2_and_10 ) or `` 400 mg to 800 mg '' ( claims 3_and_11 )
Dependent_claims 4-6 12-14 and 18-20 specify specific times for administering the metaxalone relative to the consumption of food either thirty minutes prior to two hours after consumption of food ( claims 4 12_and_18 ) `` substantially at the same time '' as consumption of food ( claims 5 13_and_19 ) or up to one hour after consumption of food ( claims 6 14_and_20 )
Dependent_claims 7_and_15 limit the dosage to a tablet_form and dependent_claims 8_and_16 limit the dosage to a `` unit_dosage_form ''
Dependent claim 21 claims the method of claim 1 with the additional_limitation of `` informing '' the patient that taking metaxalone with food will increase the drug 's bioavailability and dependent claim 22 claims the method of claim 1 with the additional_limitation that `` the metaxalone is from a container with printed labeling advising '' that taking metaxalone with food will increase the drug 's bioavailability

The ¡¬102_patent issued on January 27 2004 and is titled `` Methods of Using Metaxalone in the Treatment of Musculoskeletal Conditions ''
Elan assigned the application that resulted in the ¡¬102_patent to King in 2003
Like the ¡¬ 128 patent the ¡¬102_patent discloses a method of `` increasing the bioavailability of metaxalone by administration of an oral_dosage_form with food ''
¡¬102_patent [ Abstract ]
Independent_claim 1 claims a method for using metaxalone in the treatment of musculosketal_conditions comprising both `` providing '' a patient with a `` therapeutically effective_amount of metaxalone '' and `` informing '' the patient that taking metaxalone with food increases the bioavailability of the drug
Claims 2_through_5 depend from claim 1 and either specify the `` therapeutically effective_amount '' as 200 mg to 900 mg ( claim 2 ) or 400 mg to 800 mg ( claim 3 ) or limit the dosage to a tablet_form ( claim 4 ) or a `` unit_dosage_form '' ( claim 5 )

Independent_claim 6 claims a `` method of using metaxalone in the treatment of musculosketal_conditions '' consisting of `` informing a patient '' that taking metaxalone with food increases the bioavailability of the drug compared to taking metaxalone without food
Independent_claim 7 claims a `` method of using metaxalone in the treatment of musculosketal_conditions '' by `` obtaining metaxalone from a container providing information that administration of metaxalone with food '' increases the drug 's bioavailability and `` ingesting the metaxalone with food ''

Independent_claim 8 claims a `` method of using metaxalone in the treatment of musculosketal_conditions '' comprising both administering metaxalone with food and informing the patient that such administration increases the bioavailability of the drug
Dependent_claims 9_through_11 limit claim 8 to metaxalone from a container with printed information concerning the increased bioavailability of the drug ( claim 9 ) metaxalone in a tablet_form ( claim 10 ) and 400 mg of metaxalone ( claim 11 )
Claims 12 13 and 14 depend from claim 9 and limit the printed label to stating certain_percentage_increases in the *1272 bioavailability of metaxalone
Finally claim 15 depends from claim 8 and limits the metaxalone to a 400 mg tablet with a printed label that states certain_percentage_increases in the bioavailability of the metaxalone

Before the district_court Eon presented six prior_art_references it contended invalidated the ¡¬128 and ¡¬102_patent s. See King_Pharms. Inc. 593 F.Supp.2d at 504-06
In granting Eon 's motion for summary_judgment the district_court relied only upon three references : KAZEM FATHIE Musculoskeletal Disorders and Their Management with a New Relaxant CLINICAL MEDICINE 678 ( April 1965 ) ( `` Fathie_II '' ) ; JOSEPH A. ALBANESE NURSES ' DRUG REFERENCE 427 ( 2_ed._1982 ) ( `` Albanese '' ) ; and ANNE C. ABRAMS CLINICAL DRUG THERAPY 145 ( 1995 ) ( `` Abrams '' )
See id.at 506-15

Fathie_II describes a clinical study in which patients were given 800 mg of metaxalone to be taken three to five times a day
The article notes that several patients complained of nausea and that `` [ n ] ausea might have been less prominent if the medication had been taken with food ''
J.A.3054

Albanese is a reference_guide for registered nurses
The guide discloses that metaxalone is available in 400 mg tablets and recommends a dosage range of 800 mg three to four times daily
The guide also notes that `` [ a ] dministration with meals will help reduce gastric upset ''
J.A.3065

Abrams is another reference_guide for registered nurses
The reference_guide discloses providing patients with 800 mg of metaxalone three or four times daily for not more than ten consecutive days
The reference_guide also instructs nurses to give metaxalone `` with milk or food '' in order to `` decrease gastrointestinal distress ''
J.A.3072

Eon moved for summary_judgment of invalidity
Eon 's motion asserted that all claims of the ¡¬128 and ¡¬102_patent s were either anticipated by or obvious in light of the prior_art
The district_court granted Eon 's motion
See King_Pharms. Inc. 593_F.Supp.2d_501

Starting with independent claim 1 of the ¡¬128_patent the district_court found the claim 's preamble- '' [ a ] method of increasing the oral_bioavailability of metaxalone to a patient receiving metaxalone therapy '' -inherently anticipated because `` an increase in the bioavailability of metaxalone is inherent when the drug is taken with food ''
Id.at 508
The district_court then concluded that `` because the ¡¬128_patent teaches nothing more than administering metaxalone with food to increase its bioavailability and because Fathie_II Albanese and Abrams all teach administering metaxalone with food-which inherently increases metaxalone 's bioavailability-claim 1 is anticipated ''
Id.at 509

Turning to the ¡¬128_patent 's dependent_claims the district_court found claims 2_and_3 anticipated because the prior_art_references disclosed dosage amounts within the claimed `` therapeutically effective '' range
See id.at 510
Claims 4_through_7 were also found anticipated because the prior_art disclosed taking metaxalone with food within the various time frames claimed
See id
As for claim 8 the district_court found that no reference disclosed taking a single tablet of metaxalone with food but held the claim obvious in light of a prior_art reference 18 R.W
DENT JR. AND DOROTHY K. ERVIN A Study of Metaxalone ( Skelaxin ) vs
Placebo in Acute Musculoskeletal Disorders : A Cooperative Study CURRENT THERAPEUTIC RESEARCH ( 1975 ) ( `` Dent '' ) which discloses a single tablet dosage and Albanese which discloses taking dosages with food
See id.at 510-11

The district_court then found claims 9_through_16 mirrored claims 1_through_7 *1273 and found the claims anticipated for the earlier stated reasons
See id.at 512
Claim 17 was also found anticipated because the claim 's `` wherein the administration [ of metaxalone ] results in an increase in [ bioavailability ] '' language like claim 1 's preamble is an inherent_property of the prior_art
See id
Claims 18_through_20 which depend from claim 17 include the same timing limitations as claims 4_through_6 and were anticipated for the same_reasons
See id
The district_court then found claim 21 invalid under 35 U.S.C.¡± 101 because the claim 's `` informing '' limitation did not `` transform the metaxalone into a different state or thing ''
Id.at 513 ( citing In re Bilski 545_F.3d_943_(Fed.Cir.2008) aff 'd sub nom Bilski v. Kappos -- - U.S. -- -- 130_S.Ct._3218 177_L.Ed.2d_792_(2010) )
Finally the district_court held claim 22 anticipated because the inclusion of an instruction sheet with a known compound did not make the claim patentably distinct from the prior_art
See id
( citing In re Ngai 367_F.3d_1336_(Fed.Cir.2004) ( per curiam ) )

The district_court next addressed the ¡¬102_patent reading claim 1 to `` require [ ] giving a patient metaxalone and informing the patient about an inherent_property of the drug ''
Id.at 514 ( alteration added )
In analyzing claim 1 the district_court held that administering metaxalone to a patient was disclosed in the prior_art the `` informing '' limitation was not patentable for the same_reasons as claim 21 of the ¡¬128_patent and the entire claim was invalid under ¡± 101
See id
Claims 2_through_4 contained dosage limitations similar to the limitations disclosed in anticipated claims 2 3 and 7 of the ¡¬128_patent and the district_court found the claims to be similarly anticipated under ¡± 102
See id
Claim 5 was similar to claim 8 of the ¡¬128_patent and was obvious for the same_reasons
See id

The district_court found claim 6 claimed solely the `` informing '' limitation and invalidated it under ¡± 101.1 See id
The district_court then found claims 7_and_9 invalid for the same_reasons as claim 22 of the ¡¬128_patent and claim 8 invalid for the same_reasons as claim 21 of the ¡¬128_patent
See id.at 514-15
Claims 10_and_11 were found invalid for the same_reasons as claim 7 of the ¡¬128_patent
See id.at 515
Finally claims 12_through_15 which `` differ from the prior_art only in the content of the written material that accompanies the metaxalone '' were like claim 22 of the ¡¬128_patent anticipated because `` a variation in written material that is not functionally related to the invention does not render a known product patentable ''
Id

In light of its invalidity determination the district_court granted King 's motion to dismiss Eon 's counterclaims for fraud and unclean_hands as moot
See id.at 516
The district_court however permitted Eon to brief its argument that the case was exceptional under 35 U.S.C.¡± 285
See id.at 515
The district_court then entered its invalidity judgment against not only King but also Elan which had not participated in the summary_judgment proceeding
