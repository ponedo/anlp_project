CIRCUIT CHECK INC. Plaintiff-Appellant
v. QXQ INC. Defendant-Appellee
No._2015-1155
| July_28,_2015
Synopsis
Background : Owner of patents claiming systems and methods for marking interface_plates filed patent infringement action against competitor
After jury_verdict in patentee 's favor the United States District Court for the Eastern_District of Wisconsin William C. Griesbach J. 2014_WL_5361303 entered judgment as matter of law in competitor 's favor and patentee appealed

The Court of Appeals Moore Circuit_Judge held that substantial evidence supported jury 's determination that disputed prior_art was not analogous to claimed systems and methods

Reversed and remanded

Opinion
MOORE Circuit_Judge
Circuit_Check Inc. appeals from the Eastern_District of Wisconsin 's judgment as a matter of law after a jury_verdict that claims of U.S. Patent Nos._7592,796 ; 7,695,766 ; and 7,749,566 are invalid as obvious
We reverse the court 's judgment as a matter of law and remand

BACKGROUND
Manufacturers of circuit_boards which are used in various electronic devices use circuit board testers to test circuit_boards before the boards are integrated into finished products
Many testers require an interface_plate which is a plastic grid with holes that permit connections between the tester and the circuit board
In order to align circuit_boards during testing it is advantageous to mark certain holes on the interface_plate
Prior art methods of marking interface_plates included placing Mylar masks on the surface of the interface_plate painting the surface of interface_plates and making shallow drill marks on interface_plates

The patents at issue claim systems and methods related to marking interface_plates
Claim 1 of the ¡¬796_patent is representative : 1
An indicator interface_plate configured to provide readily visible identification of predetermined holes the plate comprising : a surface including a plurality of holes having visually discernable markings to allow a user to visually determine which of said plurality of holes are to be populated wherein a region of the plate said plurality of holes have a first predetermined indicia covering the surface surrounding said plurality of holes the plate further comprising : a second_removable_indicia overlying said first predetermined indicia said second_indicia being different from said first predetermined indicia wherein said second_indicia is removed from areas of said plate adjacent each of said predetermined holes said predetermined holes are visually identifiable to a user by the appearance of the first indicia
¡¬796_patent col.6 ll.36-51 ( emphases added )

Circuit_Check sued QXQ Inc. alleging that QXQ 's interface_plates infringed its patents
QXQ stipulated to infringement and the parties stipulated that three references describing interface_plate marking techniques were prior_art to the patents : the TTCI Specifications ; the Plexus Specification ; and the method depicted in Figure 1 of the ¡¬796_patent and described in its specification ( collectively the `` stipulated prior_art '' )
J.A.1983-84
These documents disclosed several marking techniques such as painting near the hole or drilling near the hole and painting over the drill mark
QXQ concedes in its briefing that the stipulated prior_art does not disclose an interface_plate comprising `` a second_removable_indicia overlying said first predetermined indicia.. wherein said second_indicia is removed from areas of said plate adjacent each of said predetermined holes ''
¡¬796_patent col.6 ll.45-50

At trial QXQ argued that three additional references-rock_carvings engraved signage and a machining_technique known as Prussian_Blue ( collectively the `` disputed prior_art '' ) -disclose the limitation not present in the stipulated prior_art and constitute analogous prior_art
Circuit_Check argued that the references were not analogous
With respect to rock_carvings in which a varnish is applied to rocks and then scrapped off to make designs Circuit_Check presented testimony that a skilled artisan at the time of the invention would not have considered rock_carvings to have been reasonably pertinent to the marking *1334 problem
J.A
1388 1447
With respect to engraved signage in which the top layer of a multi-layer product is removed to expose a bottom layer Circuit_Check presented testimony that engraved signage was not relevant to the problem solved by the patents
J.A
1388 1434
And with respect to Prussian_Blue a machining_technique whereby dye is applied to a workpiece and then removed by a scribe or drill Circuit_Check presented testimony that Prussian_Blue could not be used to make the claimed invention and had no connection to the problem solved by the patents
J.A
1387-88 1397 1430-32 1443-44

The validity of claims 1 2 3 5 6 8 10 11 13 and 14 of the ¡¬ 796 patent ; claims 1 2 3 5 7 8 9 11 12 and 14 of the ¡¬766_patent ; and claims 1 2 3 5 7 8 9 11 and 12 of the ¡¬566_patent was submitted to the jury
The jury found the asserted claims not invalid for obviousness
J.A
1995-96
The jury also found that the infringement was willful and awarded damages
J.A
1996-97

After the jury_verdict QXQ filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law that the asserted claims are invalid as obvious
The district court granted QXQ 's motion acknowledging that QXQ 's `` obviousness argument is not premised on citing specific examples of prior_art in the applicable field nor does it rely on nuanced discussion about the level of ordinary skill in that particular field ''
J.A
6
It found that although there was no doubt that rock_carvings `` are not technically pertinent to the 'field ' of circuit testers '' and `` witnesses credibly testified that Prussian_Blue dye had not been used on alignment plates '' `` any layman '' would have understood that interface_plates could be marked using the techniques described in the disputed prior_art
J.A
8
It further noted that `` any vandal who has 'keyed ' a car knows that stripping the paint with a key will result in the underlying metal color showing through ''
J.A
5
It found that none of the objective considerations affected its conclusion that the asserted claims would have been obvious
J.A
13
With respect to claims 5_and_11 of the ¡¬796_patent the court determined that even though QXQ did not present evidence that the additional_limitations of the claims would have been obvious those additional_limitations were too trivial to support nonobviousness
Circuit_Check appeals
We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
