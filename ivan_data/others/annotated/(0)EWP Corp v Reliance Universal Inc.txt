*900 Background
EWP Corporation is an Ohio_corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Price Brothers Company a major manufacturer of reinforced concrete_pipe machinery for making pipe and wire_mesh used as reinforcing material in concrete_pipe
La_Societe_Trefilunion assignee of the Francois patent in suit is a French corporation operating in France and is also a manufacturer of wire reinforcing mesh

Appellant Exposaic is a North Carolina corporation that manufactures welded wire_mesh intended for use as reinforcing material for concrete products including concrete_pipe but it does not itself manufacture concrete_pipe
Appellant Reliance is an Ohio_corporation that manufactures concrete_pipe and purchases wire_mesh reinforcing material from Exposaic

EWP is the exclusive licensee of Trefilunion with the right to grant sublicenses and to bring suit in its own name against any infringer of the '036_patent which is entitled `` Lattice for the Reinforcement of Tubular Concrete Elements Having a Socket [ ] Method for Producing Said Lattice and the Products Obtained ''
It discloses a method for producing wire_mesh reinforced concrete_pipes having a socket or bell that forms a flared end suitable for mating with the straight end of an adjacent pipe and the product produced thereby but claims only the method of producing the wire_reinforcement

The single claim of the patent reads : A method for producing a reinforcement having a socket for a reinforced concrete tubular element having a socket from a lattice having warp_wires and weft_wires and wherein a number of the warp_wires have successive deformed non-rectilinear portions the deformations of said portions being permanent and such that upon exertion of tensile_stress_thereon said portions can be at least partially straightened whereas the other warp_wires and all the weft_wires are rectilinear said method comprising in a first stage forming a prereinforcement by bending and closing onto themselves in the form of welded rings the transverse_wires of a section of said lattice said section being such that the transverse_wires corresponding to the socket and only these wires have a succession of permanently deformed nonrectilinear_portions so that they have an apparent_perimeter equal to the perimeter of the nondeformed transverse_wires of the rest of the prereinforcement but a real length substantially greater than said perimeter then in a second_stage radially expanding the prereinforcement so as to elongate at least partially said nonrectilinear_portions of the transverse_wires of its socket and impart thereto an apparent_perimeter which is substantially greater than that of the rest of the prereinforcement and corresponds to that of the desired socket of the reinforcement

Figures 1 2 and 3 of the '036_patent are reproduced below :

*901. ?
As shown the flat lattice or mesh A of Fig._1 has warp_wires 1_and_2 and weft_wires 3 intersecting at right angles and being welded together at their intersections
This lattice is bent and welded into a cylindrical form or prereinforcement shown as B in Fig._2
Transverse circular rings 1a and 2a are formed from the warp_wires 1_and_2 of the mesh
Warp wires 2a have convolutions corrugations or other nonrectilinear_portions such that these rings can be expanded in diameter by use of appropriate apparatus and undergo an increase in circumference as shown in Fig._3
The claimed method is thus a procedure for producing such a reinforcement cage
Fig._3 also shows in section a portion of concrete_pipe T poured and molded around the cage thereby forming a pipe with a tubular body having a mean diameter d extending from a to b and a socket_portion e

The preamble section of the patent specification states that reinforcing concrete_pipe with welded wire lattices was known but that with respect to reinforcing the socket_portion since the `` best steels do not have sufficient elongation characteristics to permit a large expansion without fracture '' two situations existed
First reinforcement of the socket_portion had been avoided or second reinforcements had been made in two parts one for the pipe body and a wider part for the socket the two parts being connected by wires
The patentee 's invention is then described in summary fashion by the following language which closely resembles that of the claim : The object of the present invention is to overcome these drawbacks
The invention provides a lattice of welded metal wires wherein a number of the warp_wires have successive deformed nonrectilinear_portions the deformations of said portions being permanent and such that upon exertion of tensile_stress_thereon said portions can be at least partially straightened whereas the other warp_wires and all the weft_wires are rectilinear
Owing to their deformed portions which may form folds waves fractions of a coil or any other sinuosities or convolutions it is possible to elongate the corresponding warp_wires and the lattice can undergo in the portion pertaining to these wires an expansion in the direction in which the warp_wires extend
*902 After expanding extensively on this broad statement of the invention the specification then explains the conversion of the lattice into the finished reinforcement for a section of concrete_pipe as follows : Now let is [ sic ] be assumed that it is required to construct a reinforcement for a concrete tubular element T having a socket e ( Fig._3 )
There is cut from the lattice according to the invention a section_A ( Fig._1 ) whose dimensions correspond to the [ sic ] those of the reinforcement to be embodied in this pipe or tubular element T. This section can be cut at the site of construction of the pipes from a roll of lattice or in a factory and delivered to the site in the flat condition

The section_A of lattice is bent and welded in the form of cylindrical blank or prereinforcement ( B ) ( Fig._2 )

In order to change from the cylindrical prereinforcement B shown in Fig 2 to the final reinforcement C shown in Fig._3 the prereinforcement B is mounted on a [ sic ] expanding machine for expanding the rings 2a
This expansion is achieved by means of a known apparatus such as an expansible mandrel controlled by hydraulic pneumatic or mechanical means and inserted in the rings 2a
By means of it is [ sic ] apparatus only the corrugated rings 2a are expanded and undergo both a mechanical circumferential elongation owing to the straightening of the corrugations or other deformations and an intrinsec [ sic ] elongation that is an elongation in the fibers of the metal
[ Emphasis ours ]
After this expansion step ( the `` second_stage '' of the method claim ) the convoluted_wire_rings 2a of Fig._2 become the similar but somewhat less convoluted_wire_rings 2b of Fig._3 of enlarged diameter

In the prosecution of the application for the patent in suit in the Patent and Trademark Office ( PTO ) the examiner cited only two prior_art references a Laswell patent and a Whitacre et al
patent neither of which is relied on in this suit with respect to the validity of the claim in suit
The latter patent is on a machine for making welded helical wire pipe or post reinforcement cages capable of making cages of varying diameter
Laswell is even farther afield being a wire structure used as spacer in composite metal vehicle floor panels not made of concrete
The patent does clearly disclose however the technique of first crimping a wire_reinforcement and thereafter lengthening the wire by putting the crimped_wire under tension to remove the crimp

Having considered the careful review of the prior_art by the district court and the briefs in this court we set forth below what appears to us to be the prior_art most relevant to the method claimed in the patent in suit

German patent 694086 was issued ( ausgegeben ) 25_July_1940 and received in the U.S. PTO November 12 1940
It relates to the making of hollow reinforced concrete bodies such as pipes among other things containing longitudinal iron reinforcing rods which are connected together by `` transverse reinforcements ''
