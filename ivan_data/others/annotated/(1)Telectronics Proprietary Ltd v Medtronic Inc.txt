BISSELL Circuit_Judge
This court accepted an interlocutory_appeal of an order dated September 8 1986 83 Civ
No._8568-_Leisure [ hereinafter September 8 Order ] from the District Court for the Southern_District of New_York
The district_court stated the controlling question of law as : Whether consistent with the Code of Professional_Responsibility of the American_Bar_Association or the Model Rules of Professional Conduct a patent attorney can work with a corporate_inventor to draft or prosecute a patent application to issuance of a patent and subsequently despite the objection of both the corporate_inventor and a later assignee of the patent represent interests seeking to invalidate or narrowly construe the self-same patent
**48 Telectronics_Proprietary Ltd. v. Medtronic Inc. 83 Civ
No._8568-_Leisure ( S.D.N.Y
Jan._7,_1987 ) ( order granting Request for Certification of September 8 Order ) [ hereinafter Certification Order ]
The motion of Medtronic Inc. to disqualify William_C._Nealon and Michael_I._Rackman and his law firm Gottlieb Rackman & Reisman as counsel for Telectronics_Proprietary Ltd. Telectronics Inc. and Telectronics U.S.A. Inc. ( collectively `` Telectronics '' ) was denied with qualification in the September 8 Order
In the context of the facts of this case we affirm the September 8 Order

BACKGROUND
This dispute began in August 1983 with an International Trade Commission ( ITC ) investigation denominated In re Certain Cardiac Pacemakers and Components Thereof Inv
No._337- TA-162 [ hereinafter Cardiac Pacemakers ]
Medtronic sought relief under 19 U.S.C.¡± 1337 ( Supp
III 1985 ) for alleged infringement by Telectronics of Medtronic 's four patents-United States Letters Patent Nos._3648,707 ( '707 ) 4,059,116 ( '116 ) 4,312,355 ( '355 ) and 3,595,242 ( '242 )

In November 1983 Telectronics filed this declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration of patent_invalidity unenforceability and noninfringement with respect to the '707 '116 and '355_patent s. Medtronic counterclaimed for infringement of these three patents and the '242_patent and sought a declaration that the four patents were valid infringed and enforceable
Because *1334 Medtronic put the '242_patent at issue Telectronics filed a First Amended and Supplemental Complaint requesting that all four patents be declared invalid and unenforceable and that Telectronics be declared not to have infringed the patents

Medtronic moved to disqualify counsel
It argued that Nealon and Rackman had served as in-house and outside counsel respectively for American Optical Corporation ( AO ) the original patent holder and that they had participated in the prosecution of the '242_patent for AO
Medtronic urged that it was improper for Nealon and Rackman now attorneys for Telectronics to challenge the validity of the '242_patent

Medtronic claimed the status of `` former client '' for itself as assignee of the '242_patent
It also claimed this for its employee Barouh V. Berkovits the inventor of the '242_patent who was employed by AO when the patent was prosecuted
On this basis Medtronic contended that representation of Telectronics by Rackman and Nealon was contrary to the ethical requirements of Canons 4 5 7 and 9 of the Code of Professional_Responsibility of the American_Bar_Association ( ABA )
Telectronics opposed the disqualification motion on the grounds of : ( 1 ) res_judicata because of the denial of a similar motion in a related case before the ITC ( 2 ) laches and ( 3 ) the absence of conflict between representation by Rackman and Nealon and the ABA Code of Professional_Responsibility

**49 Without reaching the issues of res_judicata and laches the district_court in the September 8 Order denied Medtronic 's motion to disqualify counsel conditioned on Telectronics ' not raising an issue of fraud or misconduct regarding the prosecution of the '242_patent and restricting its proof of obviousness to art discovered after the issuance of the patent
On January 7 1987 the district_court granted Medtronic 's Request for Certification of the September 8 Order and granted it permission to petition this court to accept an appeal of the September 8 Order
We accepted the appeal on May_22,_1987
