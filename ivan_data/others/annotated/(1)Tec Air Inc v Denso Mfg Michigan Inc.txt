TEC AIR INC. Plaintiff-Appellee v. DENSO MANUFACTURING MICHIGAN INC. ( formerly known as Nippondenso Manufacturing USA Inc. ) and Denso_Corporation ( formerly known as Nippondenso Co. Ltd. ) Defendants-Appellants
No._99-1011
| Sept._30,_1999
| Rehearing Denied ; Suggestion for Rehearing En Banc Declined Nov._8,_1999
Synopsis
Owner of patents for method of and device for making properly balanced injected-molded fans brought infringement action against manufacturer of radiator and condenser_assemblies
After jury found that patents were valid and awarded damages for infringement the United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of Illinois Blanche M. Manning J. denied manufacturer 's motion for judgment as a matter of law or new_trial and manufacturer appealed
The Court of Appeals Mayer Chief_Judge held that : ( 1 ) whether patents were invalid under statutory on-sale bar was question for jury ; ( 2 ) whether patents were invalid for obviousness was question for jury ; and ( 3 ) owner was entitled to damages under entire_market_value_rule

Opinion
MAYER Chief_Judge
Denso Manufacturing Michigan Inc. and Denso_Corporation ( collectively `` Denso '' ) appeal the September 24 1998 judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of Illinois No._91- CV-4488 which was entered after the court denied Denso 's motion for judgment as a matter of law or alternatively for a new_trial on the issues of patent validity and damages
We affirm

Background
Tec_Air Inc. ( `` Tec_Air '' ) owns U.S. Patent Nos._4047 692_and_4107,257 ( `` the Swin_patents '' ) both of which have effective filing dates of September 24 1975
The Swin_patents describe a method of and a device for making properly balanced injected-molded fans
One way to balance a plastic fan is to use balance `` pads '' `` lugs '' or `` plugs '' which are deposits of plastic located in appropriate places on the fan
To create these lugs a hollow column is formed in a steel fan mold which fills with molten plastic during the injection-molding process
When Tec_Air entered the fan molding business in 1972 like other manufacturers it used several methods of creating these columns such as grinding or drilling holes in mold_inserts and refilling them if needed
A mold_insert forms a portion of the overall fan
Tec_Air also inserted replaceable brass rods into hollowed-out sections of the mold_insert which are drilled more easily because brass is a softer metal than steel ( the `` brass plug method '' )
In June 1974 Tec_Air 's employee Richard Swin Sr. conceived the method disclosed in the Swin_patents-inserting adjustable_screws into hollowed-out sections of the mold_insert that is used to form the fan hub
These screws are accessible from the front or cavity-side of the mold

Throughout the development of the claimed invention Tec_Air continued to market its fans and fan molds
For example in June 1974 Tec_Air offered to sell Keeprite Products ( `` Keeprite '' ) injected- *1357 molded fans and the corresponding mold
Keeprite placed an order in July 1974 and Tec_Air created drawings for the Keeprite_fan
One drawing dated August 16 1974 shows `` balance_plugs '' on the fan but does not specify the method of creating them
Before September 24 1974 Tec_Air asked its mold maker Jack Dearhammer at Mid City Tool & Die to quote it a price for making a mold_insert for the Keeprite_fan
The sketch used for this price quotation did not show balance_plugs but Dearhammer ultimately made the mold_insert capable of producing balance_plugs by inserting adjustable_screws into hollowed-out sections of the mold
In another attempt to solicit business Tec_Air sent sample fans to Howard Industries on August 14 1974
These fans were model number 4B-60-21
On August 13 1974 Dearhammer returned to Tec_Air the mold_insert used to make the 4B-60-21 fan after he had modified it to include the patented_invention 's adjustable_screws
Prior to sending the mold to Dearhammer however Tec_Air accumulated thousands of the 4B-60-21 fans in its inventory which were made by prior art balancing techniques

In 1991 Tec_Air sued Denso for infringement because it manufactured radiator and condenser_assemblies that included a fan that was balanced according to the claimed method
Tec_Air won the infringement phase of the trifurcated trial which Denso does not appeal
A jury then heard the invalidity phase of the suit in which Denso argued that the patents are invalid because Tec_Air offered the invention for sale more than one year before the effective filing date and because the invention of the claims would have been obvious
The jury returned special interrogatories indicating that Tec_Air neither sold nor offered the invention for sale before the critical_date and that the patented_invention would not have been obvious
The same jury subsequently awarded damages of $ 25.2 million which corresponds to a royalty of 6.5 % of the infringing sales of Denso 's entire radiator and condenser_assemblies but is nevertheless less than the royalty requested by Tec_Air
Denso moved for judgment as a matter of law or alternatively for a new_trial on the validity and damages issues

The court denied the motion for judgment as a matter of law because although the evidence showed that Tec_Air possessed mold_inserts having adjustable_screws before the critical_date there was evidence that Tec_Air did not use these inserts to create commercial products
In addition the court determined not only that Denso failed to establish a prima facie case of obviousness for lack of a suggestion to combine the cited references but also that Tec_Air produced sufficient objective evidence of nonobviousness
The court also held that the jury properly used the entire_market_value_rule in measuring damages because each Denso assembly was a single functioning unit which included the infringing fan
The court then denied Denso 's motion for a new_trial because the evidence was sufficient to support the invalidity verdict and the damage award was neither excessive nor the product of improper considerations
This appeal followed
