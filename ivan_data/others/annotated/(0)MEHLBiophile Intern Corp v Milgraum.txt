Opinion
RADER Circuit_Judge
In this patent infringement action MEHL/Biophile International Corp. Selvac_Acquisitions_Corp. and Dr. Nardo Zaias ( collectively MEHL/Biophile ) asserted that Dr. Sandy Milgraum Palomar_Medical_Technologies Inc. and Spectrum_Medical_Technologies Inc. ( Milgraum ) infringed U.S. Patent No._5059,192 ( the '192_patent )
On its motion for summary_judgment Milgraum contended that all of the '192_patent claims were anticipated by an instruction_manual for the Spectrum RD-1200 laser and by a 1987 Journal of Investigative Dermatology article authored by Dr. Luigi Polla and others ( the Polla_article )
The district_court agreed that the manual anticipated the claims granted summary_judgment of invalidity and dismissed the action
See Mehl/Biophile Int ' l *1364 Corp. v. Milgraum 8_F.Supp.2d_434 47_USPQ2d_1248_(D.N.J.1998)
Although this court disagrees that the manual discloses all the elements of the claimed invention because the Polla_article does this court affirms

I
The '192_patent entitled `` Method of Hair Depilation '' claims a method for removing hair using a laser
Hairs grows out of hair_follicles tubular apertures in the skin
The collection of germ cells from which hairs grow known as the papilla lies at the base of the follicle
The '192_patent claims a method for destroying the papilla thereby preventing hair_regrowth
The written description discloses the use of a Q-switched ruby_laser to effect the destruction

At a meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology Dr._Zaias visited Spectrum 's booth where Spectrum displayed such a laser known as the RD-1200
Spectrum sold the RD-1200 for use in removing tattoos
Dr._Zaias recognized that the same principles that govern laser_absorption in skin pigmented by a tattoo would also focus laser_absorption on the natural skin pigment found in the papilla
More specifically the papilla contains granules ( called melanosomes ) of a dark pigment ( called melanin )
A Q-switched ruby_laser aimed at the hair_follicle will penetrate the skin and reach the papillary melanin
At a particular wavelength the laser will heat up and destroy the papilla without damaging surrounding tissue

Claim 1 of the patent the only independent claim reads : 1
A method of hair_depilation comprising the steps of : a ) aligning a laser_light_applicator substantially vertically over a hair_follicle opening said applicator having an aperture of sufficient area to surround a hair_follicle and overlie its papilla ; b ) applying through said aperture to the hair_follicle a pulse of laser energy of a wavelength which is readily absorbed by the melanin of the papilla and having a radiant exposure dose of sufficient energy and duration to damage its papilla so that hair_regrowth is prevented and scarring of the surrounding skin is avoided
Dependent claims 2-6 further specify parameters of the laser_light_applicator energy delivery and the type of laser

MEHL/Biophile sued Milgraum in the United_States_District_Court for the District of New_Jersey for infringement of all the claims of the '192_patent
Milgraum moved for summary_judgment of invalidity based on 35 U.S.C.¡± 102 ( 1994 ) arguing that two prior art references each teach all the limitations of the claims
As noted at the outset Milgraum relied on the manual for the RD-1200 laser which describes the use of a laser to remove tattoos
The manual teaches the use of a Q-switched ruby_laser to remove a tattoo : `` [ E ] nergy is selectively absorbed only by pigmented chromophores and not surrounding tissue greatly reducing the risk of scarring ''

Milgraum also relied on the Polla_article entitled `` Melanosomes Are a Primary Target of Q-Switched Ruby Laser Irradiation in Guinea Pig Skin ''
The Polla_article documents `` the tissue damage induced by Q-switched ruby_laser pulses in black brown and albino ( control ) guinea_pigs.. in an effort to define the nature and extent of pigmented cell injury ''
The method involves epilating guinea_pigs with soft wax holding the aperture of the laser in contact with the skin and pulsing the laser
Using an electron microscope the researchers observed `` disruption of melanosomes deep in the hair papillae ''

The district_court considered both references but ultimately rested its decision on the RD-1200 manual
MEHL/Biophile appeals
MEHL/Biophile makes several arguments for disregarding the manual as an anticipating reference
For instance MEHL/Biophile argues that the manual does not teach use of the laser to remove hair at all
Further MEHL/Biophile contends that the manual does not disclose a substantially vertical alignment a claim element
As for the Polla_article *1365 MEHL/Biophile argues that the reference relates to guinea pig skin and does not mention hair_depilation
In addition MEHL/Biophile contends that the epilation of the guinea pig backs removed the papilla so the laser treatment could not have damaged the papilla
