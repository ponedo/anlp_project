Opinion
MOORE Circuit_Judge
This case arises under the Hatch-Waxman Act,1 and involves Glenmark_Pharmaceuticals_Ltd. and Glenmark_Pharmaceuticals_Inc. USA 's ( collectively `` Glenmark '' ) 2 proposed generic_version of FinaceaTHE_R_Gel a topical medication for various skin disorders
Glenmark appeals the United_States_District_Court for the District of Delaware 's final_judgment entered in favor of Intendis_GmbH Intraserv_GmbH & Co._KG and Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc. ( collectively `` Appellees '' )
For the reasons set forth below we affirm

*1359 BACKGROUND
Appellee Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc. holds approved New Drug Application ( `` NDA '' ) No._21470 for FinaceaTHE_R_Gel which contains azelaic_acid as the therapeutically active_ingredient in a concentration of 15 % by weight and is indicated for the topical_treatment of inflammatory_papules and pustules of mild to moderate_rosacea
FinaceaTHE_R_Gel 's inactive_ingredients known as excipients include triglycerides and lecithin
FinaceaTHE_R_Gel is manufactured in the form of a `` hydrogel '' which the district_court construed to mean `` a semisolid dosage form that contains water and a gelling agent to form a gel which may contain dispersed particles and/or insoluble liquids ''
Intendis_GmbH v. Glenmark Pharm Ltd. 117_F.Supp.3d_549 567-68 ( D.Del.2015 )

The Food and Drug_Administration 's ( `` FDA '' ) Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluation commonly known as the Orange Book lists U.S. Patent No._6534,070 ( `` the ¡¬070_patent `` ) as covering FinaceaTHE_R_Gel
The ¡¬070_patent entitled `` Composition with Azelaic Acid '' is assigned to Appellee Intraserv_GmbH & Co. and exclusively licensed to Appellee Intendis_GmbH
The patent issued in March 2003 and claims priority to a provisional application filed on February 12 1998
Sole independent claim 1 of the ¡¬ 070 patent recites :

1
A composition that comprises : ( i ) azelaic_acid as a therapeutically active_ingredient in a concentration of 5_to_20 % by weight ( iii ) at least one triacylglyceride3 in a concentration of 0.BIG_TOKEN__5_to_5__BIG_TOKEN % by weight

( iv ) propylene glycol and
( v ) at least one polysorbate in an aqueous phase that further comprises water and salts and the composition further comprises
( ii ) at least one polyacrylic acid and
( vi ) lecithin wherein the composition is in the form of a hydrogel
¡¬070_patent col. 6 lines 28-39 ( emphases added )
Glenmark_Pharmaceuticals_Ltd. submitted an Abbreviated_New_Drug_Application ( `` ANDA '' ) to the FDA seeking to market a generic_version of FinaceaTHE_R_Gel
The submission included a paragraph IV certification pursuant to 21 U.S.C.¡± 355 ( j ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ( vii ) ( IV ) asserting that the ¡¬070_patent is invalid and not infringed
Unlike FinaceaTHE_R_Gel the proposed generic_product substituted isopropyl_myristate for the claimed triglyceride and lecithin
Pursuant to 21 U.S.C.¡± 355 ( j ) ( 2 ) ( B ) ( ii ) Glenmark_Pharmaceuticals_Inc. USA informed Appellees that an ANDA had been filed
In response Appellees filed a complaint against Glenmark in the United_States_District_Court for the District of Delaware alleging that Glenmark 's submission of the ANDA infringed the ¡¬ 070 patent under 35 U.S.C.¡± 271 ( e ) ( 2 ) ( A )

The district_court held a Markman_hearing on January 21 2015 and a five-day bench trial from February 5-11 2015 on the issues of infringement and validity
On July_27,_2015 the district_court issued an opinion concluding that claims 1-12 of the ¡¬070_patent were infringed under the doctrine of equivalents and not invalid

With respect to infringement the central dispute was whether isopropyl_myristate *1360 in Glenmark 's generic_product met the claim elements triglyceride and lecithin under the doctrine of equivalents
The district_court found that it did relying on the function-way-result test
The district_court rejected Glenmark 's arguments that infringement under the doctrine of equivalents ( i ) would encompass the prior_art and ( ii ) was barred by prosecution_history_estoppel

With respect to validity the district_court found that none of the prior_art_references raised by Glenmark disclosed every element of independent claim 1 and rejected Glenmark 's argument that the claims would have been obvious
Prior to FinaceaTHE_R_Gel Bayer marketed and sold a topical 20 % azelaic_acid cream known as SkinorenTHE_R which is prior_art to the ¡¬070_patent
The district_court agreed with Glenmark that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would pursue a hydrogel formulation of azelaic_acid because the SkinorenTHE_R formulation had undesirable qualities such as phase separation of the emulsion whitening effect and spreadability problems
However the district_court determined that Glenmark failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that a person of ordinary_skill would have been motivated to combine the prior_art_references in a manner that would render claim 1 of the ¡¬070_patent obvious
It determined that even if Glenmark had Glenmark failed to show a reasonable expectation of success in making such combination
Finally the district_court found that the objective_indicia of nonobviousness namely unexpected results of the claimed formulations and commercial success of FinaceaTHE_R_Gel weighed in favor of nonobviousness

On August 14 2015 the district_court entered a final_judgment in favor of Appellees and directed the FDA not to approve Glenmark 's ANDA until after the November 18 2018 expiration of the ¡¬070_patent
This appeal followed
