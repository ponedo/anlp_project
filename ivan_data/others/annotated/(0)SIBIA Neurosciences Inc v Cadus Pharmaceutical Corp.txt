Cadus Pharmaceutical Corporation ( `` Cadus '' ) appeals the judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the Southern_District of California entered after a jury_verdict finding the patent claims at issue infringed and not invalid and assessing damages of $ 18 million
Because we determine that the asserted claims are obvious as a matter of law we reverse

BACKGROUND
The identification of compounds that bind with particular_cell_surface_proteins is useful in the search for new drugs
When such binding occurs a cascade of biochemical events is activated within the cell in which a linkage known as a signal_transduction_pathway is formed between the cell_surface_protein and a gene in the cell 's DNA
This linkage allows the cell to respond to signals from the external_environment which is critical for the cell to properly function
Compounds that activate this linkage often prove useful in pharmaceutical applications because many diseases stem from the malfunctioning of cellular communications

*1352 In general when a compound activates a signal_transduction_pathway the cell responds by directing the production or non-production of a protein from a responsive gene in the DNA
Protein production involves two distinct processes-transcription and translation
Transcription refers to the process by which a strand of messenger RNA ( `` mRNA '' ) is created by the expression of a gene
Translation refers to the process by which a corresponding_protein ( i.e. a sequence of amino acids ) is created from the mRNA
Compounds that trigger or enhance transcription and translation are referred to as agonists and compounds that block or decrease such activity are called antagonists
The displaying of agonist and antagonist_activity is an indication that a compound has bound with the cell_surface_protein and has activated the signal_transduction_pathway

SIBIA Neurosciences Inc. ( `` SIBIA '' ) is the owner of U.S. Patent No._5401,629 ( `` the '629_patent `` ) which is directed to a cell-based screening method useful for the identification of compounds that exhibit agonist and antagonist_activity with respect to particular_cell_surface_proteins
According to the patent the claimed methods are particularly effective because they allow a scientist to rapidly and reliably screen large numbers of compounds for agonist and antagonist_activity
See '629_patent col._1,_ll._45-50
Thus the scientist could quickly develop a list of candidate compounds that merit further in-depth studies for therapeutic applications
See id
Claim 1 the only independent claim reads as follows : 1
A method for identifying_compounds that modulate_cell_surface_protein-mediated activity by detecting intracellular_transduction of a signal generated upon interaction of the compound with the cell_surface_protein comprising : comparing the amount of transcription of a reporter_gene or the amount of reporter_gene_product expressed in a first_recombinant_cell in the presence of the compound with the amount of transcription or product in the absence of the compound or with the amount of transcription or product in a second_recombinant_cell ; and
selecting compounds that change the amount of transcription of a reporter_gene or the amount of reporter_gene_product expressed in the first_recombinant_cell in the presence of the compound compared to the amount of transcription or product in the absence of the compound or compared to the amount of transcription or product in the second_recombinant_cell wherein : the cell_surface_protein is a surface receptor or ion_channel ; the first_recombinant_cell contains a reporter_gene_construct and expresses the cell_surface_protein ; the second_recombinant_cell is identical to the first_recombinant_cell except that it does not express the cell_surface_protein ; and
the reporter_gene_construct contains : ( a ) a transcriptional_control_element that is responsive to the intracellular signal that is generated by the interaction of an agonist with the cell_surface_protein ; and
( b ) a reporter_gene that encodes a detectable transcriptional or translational product and that is in operative association with the transcriptional_control_element
See id. col._13,_l._44- col._14,_l._12

The methods claimed in the '629_patent utilize a recombinant_cell that is exposed to various compounds in order to determine whether those compounds exhibit the desired activity
This recombinant_cell in addition to the host cell itself has two basic components : a heterologous1 cell_surface_protein and a reporter_gene_construct
The cell_surface_protein can be either an ion_channel or a cell surface receptor
Ion channels are proteins that act as pores in the cell membrane and allow small inorganic ions to flow in or out *1353 of the cell
These ion_channels open and close based on interaction with certain external compounds
Cell surface receptors on the other hand are proteins that span the external membrane of the cell and bind with particular molecules to commence a chain of intracellular reactions that transmit external signals to the DNA
As described above cell_surface_proteins are physiologically important because they play a vital role in the stimulation of signal_transduction_pathways and thus the cell 's ability to respond appropriately to stimuli from the external_environment

The second major component of the cell utilized in the '629_patent is the reporter_gene_construct which consists of a transcriptional_control_element and a reporter_gene
The transcriptional_control_element is a gene that reacts to the signal from the cell_surface_protein and regulates transcription of the reporter_gene
The reporter_gene through the processes of transcription and translation creates a corresponding_protein referred to as `` reporter_gene_product ''
Both transcription of the reporter_gene and translation to the reporter_gene_product can be measured

In the claimed methods this recombinant_cell is used in a battery of assays the goal of which is to determine if a given compound exhibits the desired binding activity with respect to a particular_cell_surface_protein
The method of claim 1 contains two assays
In the first assay referred to as the `` compound/no compound assay '' the recombinant_cell is exposed to a test_compound
The amount of reporter_gene_transcription or reporter_gene_product expressed in that recombinant_cell is then compared to the amount of reporter_gene_transcription or reporter_gene_product expressed in a recombinant_cell that was not exposed to the test_compound
In the second assay known as the `` receptor/no receptor assay '' two recombinant_cells are exposed to a test_compound
However one of the recombinant_cells has a cell_surface_protein but the other does not
The amount of reporter_gene_transcription or reporter_gene_product expressed in both of these cells is then compared
Based on these measurements the scientist is able to detect whether the compound has bound to the cell_surface_protein and modulated the signal_transduction_pathway
This in turn allows the scientist to determine whether the compound is a candidate for further study or should be excluded from consideration

SIBIA sued Cadus for infringement of the '629_patent
The court held a Markman_hearing see Markman v. Westview Instruments Inc. 52_F.3d_967 979 34_USPQ2d_1321 1329 ( Fed.Cir.1995 ) ( en banc ) aff 'd 517_U.S._370 116_S.Ct._1384 134_L.Ed.2d_577_(1996) and issued an order construing numerous claim terms including `` identifying_compounds '' `` cell '' `` recombinant_cell '' `` comparing the amount '' `` identical '' and `` selecting compounds ''
Only the construction of `` cell '' `` identifying_compounds '' and `` selecting compounds '' are relevant to this appeal
Before the district court Cadus argued that because the claims use the term `` cell '' without modification this term should refer to all cells eukaryotic as well as prokaryotic.2 Alternatively Cadus argued that if `` cell '' should be limited to less than all cells it should be limited to only mammalian_cells because the examples found in the written description of the patent only discuss mammalian_cells
The court decided however that because the patentee describes the cells used in the claimed methods as `` eukaryotic_cells '' in the written description see '629_patent col._3,_ll._52-56 col._4,_ll._9-11 a person of ordinary skill in the art would interpret cell as found in the claim_language to mean only eukaryotic_cells

Also important to this appeal is the court 's construction of the phrases `` identifying_compounds '' and `` selecting compounds ''
*1354 At the Markman_hearing the parties disagreed as to whether this claim_language required the compounds to be unknown to interact with the particular_cell_surface_protein prior to conducting the assays or whether these terms include both compounds known and unknown to interact with the cell_surface_proteins
The court held that the ordinary meaning of `` identifying_compounds '' is determining which compounds interact with a particular_cell_surface_protein from a group of compounds with unknown properties
Thus the testing of compounds that are known to interact with a particular_cell_surface_protein does not fall within the ambit of `` identifying_compounds ''
Similarly the court held that `` selecting compounds '' referred only to choosing compounds from a group previously unknown to interact with a cell_surface_protein based on the results of the reporter_gene_transcription and translation analyses

The case then proceeded to a jury trial
At trial Cadus asserted that the claims of the '629_patent were invalid as obvious under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103 ( a ) or as not enabled under ¡± 112 ?
1
With regard to obviousness Cadus asserted that the claims of the '629_patent would have been obvious in view of Deborah J. Stumpo et al. Identification of c-fos Sequences Involved in Induction by Insulin and Phorbol Esters 263 J
Biological Chem
1611 ( Feb.1988 ) ( `` Stumpo '' ) alone given the knowledge in the art as embodied in the review article by Henry A. Lester Heterologous Expression of Excitability Proteins : Route to More Specific Drugs ? 241_Science_1057_(Aug.1988) ( `` Lester '' )
Additionally Cadus asserted that the claims would have been obvious in view of Stumpo in combination with William S. Chen et al. Requirement for intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase in the immediate and late action of the EGF receptor 328_Nature_820_(Aug.1987) ( `` Chen '' ) and Ronald Mark Evans et al. Hormone Receptor Compositions and Methods WO 88/03168 ( May 1988 ) ( `` Evans '' )
With regard to non-enablement Cadus claimed that if `` cell '' is to be interpreted to broadly include all eukaryotic_cells the claims are not enabled because the written description discloses only how to practice the invention using mammalian_cells
The jury returned a verdict in favor of SIBIA finding that Cadus infringed claims 1 2 4-7 9 10 12 and 14 of the '629_patent
The jury rejected Cadus 's invalidity defenses of obviousness and non-enablement
Damages based on the calculation of a `` reasonable royalty '' were assessed at $ 18 million
Cadus filed numerous post-trial motions including motions for judgment as a matter of law ( `` JMOL '' ) or a new_trial on the issues of infringement and invalidity and motions for remittitur or a new_trial for damages
All of Cadus 's motions were denied
This appeal followed
