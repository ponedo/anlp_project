United States Court of Appeals Federal Circuit
G. DAVID JANG M.D. Plaintiff-Appellant
v. BOSTON SCIENTIFIC CORPORATION Scimed_Life_Systems Inc. nka Boston Scientific Scimed Inc. Defendants-Cross-Appellants
2016-1275
| 2016-1575
| Decided : September 29 2017
Synopsis
Background : Assignor of patent directed at coronary_stent brought action alleging that patent assignee 's accused device infringed certain claims of patent thereby entitling assignor to royalty payments under assignment agreement
Following jury trial the United_States_District_Court for the Central_District of California No._5 :05-cv-00426-VAP-MRW denied assignor 's motion for judgment as a matter of law vacated jury 's finding that accused device infringed patent under doctrine of equivalents and entered judgment of noninfringement
Assignor appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Chen Circuit_Judge held that :

sufficient evidence supported jury 's finding that accused device did not literally infringe claimed connecting strut_columns ;

hypothetical_claim that added flexibility requirement narrowed scope of issued claim precluding any ensnarement_analysis on such_basis ;

hypothetical_claim that stated first_connecting_strut had to include `` at least '' proximal distal and intermediate sections had same claim scope as issued claim precluding any ensnarement_analysis on such_basis ; and

assignor was not prejudiced by any lack of pretrial discovery as to assignee 's ensnarement defense

Affirmed

Opinion
Chen Circuit_Judge
This dispute between G. David Jang M.D
( Dr._Jang ) and Boston Scientific Corp. and Scimed_Life_Systems Inc. ( collectively BSC ) more than a decade old returns to us for a fourth time
In the latest appeal of this case involving U.S. Patent No._5922,021 ( '021_Patent ) and BSC 's sales of several coronary_stents ( collectively Express_stent ) Dr._Jang challenges the district_court 's denial of his motion for judgment as a matter of law ( JMOL ) on the ground that no reasonable jury could have found that BSC 's Express_stent did not literally infringe claims 1_and_8_(the_asserted_claims) of the '021_Patent
Dr._Jang also challenges the district_court 's vacatur of the jury 's finding that the Express_stent infringed the asserted claims under the doctrine of equivalents as well as the entry of judgment of non-infringement in favor of BSC on the ground that the district_court incorrectly held that he failed to provide an acceptable hypothetical_claim for an ensnarement_analysis and thereby failed to prove that his doctrine of equivalents theory did not *1279 ensnare the prior art
Dr._Jang 's appeal is accompanied by a purported cross-appeal from BSC which assigns error to the district_court 's holding that BSC was contractually obligated to pay royalties for past sales of the Express_stent if it infringed the asserted claims notwithstanding the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office 's ( PTO ) eventual cancellation of them in an ex parte reexamination

Because we affirm the district_court 's denial of Dr._Jang 's motion for JMOL its vacatur of the jury verdict of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents and its entry of judgment of non-infringement we dismiss BSC 's cross-appeal and need not reach the arguments it raised

INTRODUCTION
A
The '021_Patent
Dr._Jang is the named inventor of the '021_Patent which is generally directed to a coronary_stent
A representative embodiment of the claimed stent is below

?
'021_Patent fig._9 D ( annotated )
Inside the dotted boxes are expansion_columns made up of a plurality of pairs of expansion struts
The solid box outlines a connecting strut_column made up of connecting struts
Each connecting strut has : ( i ) a section at the `` proximal '' end that connects to an expansion_strut_pair in one expansion_column ; ( ii ) a section at the `` distal '' end that connects to an expansion_strut_pair in another expansion_column ; and ( iii ) an intermediate section that is not parallel to the two end sections
See e.g. id
col. 13_ll._5 -18 38-48
Given the connecting strut 's proximal and distal connections each connecting strut links expansion_strut_pairs from two expansion_columns in a `` peak-to-peak '' configuration
The connecting struts are designed to increase the longitudinal flexibility of the stent

Independent claim 1 is representative of the asserted claims : 1
A stent in a non-expanded state comprising : a first_expansion_strut_pair including a first_expansion_strut positioned adjacent to a second_expansion_strut and a joining *1280 strut of the first_expansion_strut_pair that couples the first and second_expansion_struts at a distal_end of the first_expansion_strut_pair a plurality of the first_expansion_strut_pair forming a first_expansion_column ; a second_expansion_strut_pair including a first_expansion_strut positioned adjacent to a second_expansion_strut and a joining strut of the second_expansion_strut_pair that couples the first and second_expansion_struts of the second_expansion_strut_pair at a proximal_end of the second_expansion_strut_pair a plurality of the second_expansion_strut_pair forming a second_expansion_column ; a first_connecting_strut including a first_connecting_strut_proximal_section a first_connecting_strut_distal_section and a first_connecting_strut_intermediate_section the first_connecting_strut_proximal_section being coupled to the distal_end of the first_expansion_strut_pair in the first_expansion_column and the first_connecting_strut_distal_section being coupled to the proximal_end of the second_expansion_strut_pair of the second_expansion_column a plurality of the first_connecting_strut forming a first_connecting_strut_column that couples the first_expansion_column to the second_expansion_column the first_connecting_strut_intermediate_section being nonparallel to the first_connecting_strut proximal and distal sections wherein the first_expansion_strut of the first_expansion_strut_pair in the first_expansion_column has a longitudinal_axis offset from a longitudinal_axis of the first_expansion_strut of the second_expansion_strut_pair in the second_expansion_column
