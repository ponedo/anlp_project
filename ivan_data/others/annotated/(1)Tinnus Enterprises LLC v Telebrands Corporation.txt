The United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Texas Robert Schroeder III J. 2015_WL_11089480 adopted report and recommendation of John D. Love United States Magistrate Judge 2015_WL_11089479 and entered preliminary_injunction barring competitor from selling its product
Competitor appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Stoll Circuit_Judge held that :

application of plain and ordinary meaning to term `` attached '' in patent was reasonable when analyzing patentee 's likelihood of success on the merits ;

it would review district_court 's determination that competitor failed to raise a substantial_question that patent was invalid for indefiniteness for plain error rather than for abuse of discretion ;

competitor failed to raise a substantial_question of patent 's validity by arguing that patent claim term `` substantially filled '' was invalid for indefiniteness ;

competitor did not show that patent was invalid as obvious ; and

patentee demonstrated irreparable_harm as a result of competitor 's allegedly infringing product

Opinion
This is an appeal from the grant of a preliminary_injunction
The United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Texas ruled for the patentee Tinnus_Enterprises LLC and entered a preliminary_injunction barring Telebrands_Corporation from selling its accused product Balloon_Bonanza or any colorable imitation thereof
Telebrands alleges that the district_court abused its discretion by concluding that ( 1 ) the asserted claims were likely infringed ; ( 2 ) the claims were not vulnerable on indefiniteness or obviousness grounds ; and ( 3 ) Tinnus made a showing of irreparable_harm
For the reasons stated below we disagree with Telebrands and affirm the district_court 's grant of a preliminary_injunction

BACKGROUND
Tinnus_Enterprises LLC produces a toy for filling water balloons covered by *1195 U.S. Patent No._9051,066 which it calls `` Bunch O Balloons ''
Telebrands_Corporation sells a competing product `` Balloon_Bonanza ''
Both products attach to a hose and fill multiple_water_balloons at once by channeling the water into the balloons through a set of hollow_tubes
A side-by-side comparison of the rival products is shown below : ?

The Magistrate Judge issued a Report and Recommendation ( `` R & R '' ) in which he recommended granting Tinnus 's motion
