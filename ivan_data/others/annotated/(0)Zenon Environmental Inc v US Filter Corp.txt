LOURIE Circuit_Judge
United States Filter Corp. ( `` US_Filter '' ) appeals from the final_judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the Southern_District of California following a bench_trial that the asserted claims of U.S._Patent 6,620,319 ( `` the ¡¬319_patent `` ) are not invalid as anticipated under 35 U.S.C.¡± 102
Zenon Environmental Inc. ( `` Zenon '' ) cross-appeals the district_court 's grant of summary_judgment that the accused products do not infringe the ¡¬319_patent
Because we conclude that the district_court erred in determining that the ¡¬ 319 patent was entitled to the priority_date of an earlier filed patent and thus clearly erred in concluding that the ¡¬319_patent was not anticipated by that patent we reverse the court 's judgment of no invalidity and hold that patent to be invalid
In light of that conclusion we need not reach Zenon 's cross-appeal seeking reversal of the district_court 's grant of summary_judgment of noninfringement

BACKGROUND
Zenon owns the ¡¬319_patent entitled `` Apparatus for Withdrawing Permeate Using An Immersed Vertical Skein of Hollow [ Fiber ] Membranes ''
The patent relates to the field of water treatment and filtration systems and is directed to `` relatively large_systems for the microfiltration of liquids ''
¡¬319_patent col.2 ll.47-48
The patent discloses the use of a vertical_skein which the patent describes as `` an integrated combination of structural elements including ( i ) a multiplicity of vertical_fibers of substantially equal length ; ( ii ) a pair of headers in each of which are potted the opposed terminal portions of the fibers so as to leave their ends open ; and ( iii ) permeate_collection means held peripherally in fluid-tight engagement with each header so as to collect permeate from the ends of the fibers ''
Id.at col.1 ll.31-38 ( emphases added )

As disclosed in the patent a skein of hollow_fiber_membranes is submerged within the substrate i.e. the liquid feed containing the unwanted particulate_matter
The fibers filter the substrate using a process called an outside-in flow
Id.at col.4 ll.30-33
During that process `` [ t ] he feed of substrate is introduced externally of the fibers '' which are made of porous or semipermeable materials and is `` resolved into 'permeate ' and 'concentrate ' streams ''
Id
A permeate_collection means is used to collect permeate from the ends of the fibers
The ¡¬319_patent describes the importance of keeping the surface of the fibers free of particulate_matter which generally includes micron-sized and submicron-sized *1373 organic or inorganic matter id.at col.1 ll.46-53 in order to ensure the free flow of permeate over an extended period of time thereby reducing the frequency with which the fibers must be cleaned
Id.at col.5 ll.46-56

In order to achieve that objective the patent discloses using `` a cleansing gas typically air discharged near the base of a skein to produce bubbles in a specified size range and in an amount large enough to scrub the fibers and to cause the fibers to scrub themselves against one another ''
Id.at col.2 ll.51-55
It is the `` scrubbing force exerted by the bubbles on the fibers [ that ] keeps their surfaces sufficiently free of attached microorganisms and deposits of inanimate particles to provide a relatively high and stable flow of permeate over many weeks if not months of operation ''
Id.at col.5 ll.49-53
Thus the ¡¬319_patent discloses that `` the most preferred use of the skein as a membrane device is in a bank in combination with a gas-distribution_means which is typically used to distribute air or oxygen-enriched air between the fibers from within the skein or between adjacent skeins at the bases thereof ''
Id.at col.7 ll.21-25
An illustration of a pair of skeins in combination with a gas-distribution_means is shown in Figure 10 of the ¡¬ 319 patent :

?
The pair of skeins 40_and_40 ¡¬ consists of upper and lower_headers 41 u and 41 u ' and 41 b and 41 b ' respectively vertical_fibers 42_and_42 ¡¬ and permeate_collection means 46u and 46b
The skeins share a common gas-distribution_means 50 which is preferably split into two arms 51_and_51 ¡¬
Id.at col.25 ll.8-9
Claims 7-12 are the asserted claims of the ¡¬319_patent
Claim 7 the only independent asserted claim reads as follows : 7
An apparatus for treating a multicomponent liquid substrate while leaving particulate_matter therein comprising ( a ) a non-pressurized reservoir for containing the substrate ; ( b ) a plurality of hollow fiber filtering membranes immersed in the substrate wherein the membranes are disposed generally vertically between upper and lower_headers such that ( i ) outsides of ends of the membranes are sealingly secured to the headers in a closely *1374 spaced apart relationship ( ii ) lumens of the membranes are in fluid_communication with at least one permeate_collection means and ( iii ) said membranes having a length between opposed_surfaces of the headers such that the membranes may move against each other but wherein the length is less [ than ] 5 % greater than the distance between opposed_surfaces of the headers ; ( c ) a pump in fluid_communication with said lumens of said membranes said pump operable to apply a suction to the lumens of the membranes to draw a component of the substrate as permeate through said membranes ; and ( d ) a gas_distribution_system having through-passages through the lower_header to discharge bubbles into the substrate above the lower_header
¡¬319_patent claim 7 ( emphasis added )
Thus a particular type of gas-distribution_means viz. one that requires through-passages through the lower_header to discharge bubbles into the substrate above the lower_header is present in all of the asserted claims
Figure 6 of the ¡¬319_patent depicts an example of that type of gas distribution_means :

?
Figure 6 depicts a single skein 110 in which air_tubes 103 traverse the integral header 101 with a thickness L1-L2
¡¬319_patent col.19 l.62-col.20 l.22
As seen from the illustration air passes through the air_tubes and escapes above the top surface of the header L2
The fibers 12 are secured in the header and are positioned above a permeate pan 120 which is used to collect permeate from the fibers
The ¡¬319_patent is the sixth patent to issue from a series of connected applications that were filed by the same assignee
As set forth in column one of the ¡¬319_patent that patent is a : continuation of Ser

No._5639,373 [ `` the ¡¬373_patent `` ]
'319_patent col.1 ll.8-18 ( emphases added )
Zenon asserts that the ¡¬319_patent is entitled to the priority_date of the ¡¬373_patent under 35 U.S.C.¡± 120.1

Relevant to this appeal are the disclosures of the intervening patents.2 The ¡¬250_patent entitled `` Baffle for Conversion of Fine Bubbles to Coarse While Filtering with a Vertical Skein of Hollow Fibers '' is directed to a filtration_device `` provided for withdrawing permeate essentially continuously from a multicomponent aqueous substrate containing growing microorganisms in a reservoir ''
¡¬250_patent Abstract
The ¡¬250_patent teaches `` the utilization of bubbles of air in two size ranges one fine the other coarse ( defined below ) to accomplish different functions in the operation of a vertical_skein of hollow_fiber_membranes for filtration of an aqueous medium from a biomass ''
Id.at col.1 ll.12-16
The inventors discovered that very small or fine_bubbles were an efficient and economical means of providing `` an oxygen-containing gas ( typically air or air enriched with oxygen occasionally pure oxygen ) required for growth of microorganisms in the aqueous substrate '' id.at col.2 ll.3-11 in contrast to coarse_bubbles which are useful for maintaining `` clean fiber surfaces during microfiltration ( MF ) or ultrafiltration ( UF ) with a skein ''
Id.at col.2 ll.1-3

In the Summary of Invention section of the ¡¬250_patent specification the patentees stated that : It is.. a general object of this invention to provide a filtration_device for the separation of a liquid from a biomass containing live microorganisms requiring a gas typically oxygen for growth the device comprising a vertical_skein of fibers resting on a conversion_baffle disposed within a biomass contacted with fine_bubbles of the gas ; the conversion_baffle has through-openings which allow gas trapped under the baffle to be discharged as coarse_bubbles from a discharging zone near the surface of a gas-distribution supply line
Id.at col.3 ll.32-42
An example of such a device is depicted in Figure 4 of the ¡¬250_patent :

*1376. ?
The device contains an air supply pipe 60 that is fitted with fine-bubble generators 61 which produce fine_bubbles in the fine-bubble discharging zone 66
Id.at col.1 ll.49-67
As the fine_bubbles travel upwards the bubbles collect in a trapping zone 48-a mass of air directly below the baffle 40 and above the surface of the substrate
The air then travels through the perforations 41 of the baffle 40 and is converted into coarse_bubbles in the coarse-bubble discharging zone 68
Id
Thus the filtration_device disclosed in the ¡¬250_patent differs from the filtration_device described in the ¡¬319_patent in that in addition to the use of a vertical_skein the invention of the ¡¬250_patent uses a conversion_baffle which enables fine_bubbles that are necessary for the oxygenation of microorganisms in the substrate to convert into coarse_bubbles as they pass through the baffle
Notably however the inventors clarified in the ¡¬250_patent that : The vertical_skein is not the subject matter of this invention and any prior art vertical_skein may be used
Further details relating to the construction and deployment of a most preferred skein are found in the parent U.S._Pat
No._5639,373 and in Ser
No._08_/690,045 the relevant disclosures of each of which are included by reference thereto as if fully set forth herein
Id.at col.2 ll.30-36
Thus the ¡¬250_patent specification purports to incorporate by reference the details relating to the construction and deployment of a vertical_skein as disclosed in the grandparent_patents
US_Filter is one of Zenon 's principal competitors in the water filtration industry
On October 3 2003 Zenon brought suit against U.S._Filter alleging that it infringed three of its patents viz. U.S._Patent Nos._6245,239 ( `` the ¡¬239_patent `` ) 6,550,747 ( `` the ¡¬747_patent `` ) and the ¡¬319_patent
In November 2004 following a *1377 Markman hearing the court construed the disputed claim terms
After the court issued its claim_construction_ruling Zenon conceded that the accused products did not infringe the asserted claims of the ¡¬319_patent
US_Filter then moved for summary_judgment on the patents in suit which the court granted in part and denied in part
The court granted summary_judgment of noninfringement as to the ¡¬747_patent denied summary_judgment of noninfringement and invalidity as to the ¡¬239_patent and denied summary_judgment of invalidity as to the ¡¬319_patent

On April 27_and_28 2005 the court held a bench_trial on the validity of the ¡¬319_patent
At trial U.S._Filter argued that the ¡¬319_patent was not entitled to claim priority from the ¡¬373_patent
In particular U.S._Filter asserted that the intervening patents failed to incorporate by reference the gas_distribution_system disclosed in the ¡¬373_patent and thus broke the chain of priority because the asserted claims in the ¡¬319_patent were not supported by each patent in the family_chain-a requirement for entitlement to the benefit of the filing_date of an earlier patent under 35 U.S.C.¡± 120
In light of the undisputed fact that the ¡¬373_patent contains each and every element of the claimed invention of the ¡¬319_patent U.S._Filter argued that the ¡¬373_patent invalidated the ¡¬319_patent by reason of anticipation

On May_5,_2005 the district_court rejected U.S._Filter 's assertion and concluded that U.S._Filter failed to prove that the ¡¬319_patent was invalid by clear and convincing evidence
US_Filter subsequently moved for summary_judgment of noninfringement of the ¡¬319_patent which the court granted
The parties agreed to dismiss the remaining pending claims without prejudice and on January 17 2006 the court entered final_judgment on all of the asserted patents

US_Filter timely appealed the court 's decision with regard to the validity of the ¡¬319_patent
Zenon cross-appealed the court 's claim_construction_ruling and grant of summary_judgment of noninfringement
We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
