Synopsis
Background : Owner of patent for capillary_electrophoresis_device sued competitor for infringement
The United_States_District_Court for the District of New_Jersey Mary L. Cooper J. 2004_WL_1398227 found patent invalid as obvious and owner appealed

Opinion
RADER Circuit_Judge
In the United_States_District_Court for the District of New_Jersey a jury found in favor of Plaintiff-Appellant Princeton_Biochemicals Inc. ( Princeton ) rejecting the claims of Defendant-Appellee Beckman Coulter Inc. ( Beckman ) that Princeton 's U.S. Patent No._5045,172 ( the '172_patent ) is invalid by reason of obviousness and prior_invention and finding that Beckman infringed the '172_patent
On all three *1334 questions however the district_court found the jury 's verdict unsupported by substantial_evidence and granted judgment as a matter of law ( JMOL ) in favor of Beckman
Princeton_Biochemicals Inc. v. Beckman Coulter Inc. No._96-5541 ( MLC ) 2004_WL_1398227 ( D.N.J
June 17 2004 )
Because the district_court properly concluded that substantial_evidence did not support the jury 's verdict of nonobviousness this court affirms

I. Dr. Norberto Guzman is the inventor of the '172_patent which he assigned to Princeton
The '172_patent claims a capillary_electrophoresis_device
Electrophoresis is one method available for the investigation of biological materials and is an efficient procedure for the separation and detection of proteins and other matter
'172_patent col._1,_ll._16-20
Electrophoretic separation one species of electrophoresis relies on the differential speeds of the migration of differently charged particles in an electric field
Id.at col._1,_ll._21-23
Capillary electrophoresis is one type of electrophoretic separation
Id.at col._1,_ll._17-20
As the '172_patent describes [ I ] t is generally known that a material containing mixtures of substances to be analyzed can be passed along a capillary_tube and through a detector under the influence of an applied voltage
The applied voltage charges the substances and the charges on the substances determine their spacing and their speed of passage along the capillary_tube
Id.at col._2,_ll._32-38
Capillary tubes generally made of quartz range in lengths of roughly 10_to_100 centimeters and 25-200 microns in diameter
Id.at col._1,_ll._50-58
Due to the dimensions of a tube capillary electrophoresis requires only a minute sample size to efficiently separate and identify the components of a solution

Claim 32 of the '172_patent claims a specific capillary_electrophoresis_device : Capillary electrophoresis apparatus comprising a capillary_tube of the type which can be electrically charged said capillary_tube having first and second_ends first means at said first_end of said capillary_tube providing a source of buffer_solution and a source of a sample_substance to be analyzed second_means coupled to said apparatus for applying electrical_potential across said capillary_tube whereby a sample flows through said capillary_tube and past said detector said first means includes a rotatable_table carrying a plurality of sample_cups and a holder for holding an end of said capillary_tube in operative_relation with one of the said cups said cups containing either buffer_solution or a sample to be analyzed and
said capillary_tube is in the form of a coil of glass_tubing [ secured to a support_member ]
*

Id.at col._23,_ll._30-47 ( emphases added )
The parties stipulated that claim 32 contains eight elements as follows :

Capillary electrophoresis apparatus comprising : ( 1 ) a capillary_tube of the type which can be electrically charged ( 2 ) said capillary_tube having first and second_ends ( 3 ) first means at said first_end of said capillary_tube providing a source of buffer_solution and a source of sample_substance to be analyzed *1335 ( 4 ) second_means coupled to said apparatus for applying electrical_potential across said capillary_tube whereby a sample flows through said capillary_tube and past said detector ( 5 ) said first means includes a rotatable_table carrying a plurality of sample_cups and
( 6 ) a holder for holding an end of said capillary_tube in operative_relation with one of the said cups said cups containing either buffer_solution or a sample to be analyzed and
( 7 ) said capillary_tube is in the form of a coil of glass_tubing
( 8 ) secured to a support_member

Beckman manufactures and sells the P/ACE 2000_and_5000 Series capillary_electrophoresis_devices ( `` the accused devices '' or `` the P/ACE_devices '' )
Beckman contends a prototype device named OTEP_II contained all the elements recited in claim 32
Princeton does not contest that Beckman made OTEP_II by February 1 1987
That date therefore is the relevant reduction-to-practice date for the P/ACE_devices
Beckman began selling P/ACE_devices as early as 1993

Guzman filed the application for the '172_patent on November 14 1988
Thus the critical date for evaluating 35 U.S.C.¡± 102 ( b ) prior art references is November 14 1987
Several references published before November 14 1987 discussed the electrophoretic concepts embodied in claim 32 of the '172_patent
Two particular references stand out
The first an article by Honda dated September 1987 describes ways to introduce automatically different samples into a capillary_electrophoresis_device
Susumu Honda et
al. `` Evaluation of an Automatic Siphonic Sampler for Capillary Zone Electrophoresis '' Int ' l J. on Chromatography Electrophoresis and Related Methods
The second a Ph.D. thesis by Lukacs was published in 1983 by a graduate student of Dr. James W. Jorgenson an expert who testified on behalf of Beckman
The Lukacs thesis discloses the coiling of capillary_tubes during electrophoretic work
Coiling a capillary_tube lengthens the tubing without increasing the size of the electrophoretic device
A longer tube provides better separation and identification of analytes

On November 21 1996 Princeton filed suit alleging that the P/ACE_devices infringed claim 32 of the '172_patent
Beckman denied infringement and sought a declaration of invalidity on grounds of obviousness and prior_invention
Following a grant of summary judgment of noninfringement Princeton appealed
In an unpublished opinion this court reversed holding that the district_court had improperly construed the sixth element in claim 32
Princeton_Biochemicals Inc. v. Beckman Instruments Inc. 1999_WL_641233 at *6 ( Fed.Cir.1999 ) ( `` The proper interpretation of the holder limitation is that 'in operative_relation ' encompasses both vertical_movement of the holder as well as vertical_movement of the sample_cups and the table
`` )

On remand the district_court conducted a nine-day trial followed by motions for JMOL from both parties
The district_court reserved judgment until after the jury verdict
The jury decided in favor of Princeton on all issues
Specifically the jury found that Princeton proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Beckman 's devices infringed claim 32 of the '172_patent ; that Beckman did not prove by clear and convincing_evidence that claim 32 of the patent was invalid for obviousness ; and finally that Beckman did not prove `` by clear and convincing_evidence that claim 32 is invalid because the invention described in that claim was made by Beckman before it was made by Princeton ''
*1336 Beckman timely renewed its JMOL motion and moved alternatively for a new_trial

In due course the district_court issued a carefully composed 194-page opinion that set aside the jury 's verdict and found all counts in favor of Beckman
Princeton_Biochemicals Inc. 2004_WL_1398227
The district_court also granted Beckman 's motion for a new_trial
Id.at *91
Princeton timely appealed to this court
This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
