Opinion
MOORE Circuit_Judge
Ineos_USA_LLC accused Berry_Plastics Corporation of infringing U.S. Patent No._6846,863
Ineos_appeals from the district court 's summary_judgment that the ¡¬863_patent is invalid as anticipated under 35 U.S.C.¡± 102 ( 2006 )
We affirm

*867 BACKGROUND
The ¡¬863_patent is directed to polyethylene-based compositions which can be used to form shaped_products such as screw caps for bottles
¡¬863_patent col. 1_ll._5 -8
Prior art polyethylene bottle caps incorporated a lubricant to optimize the cap 's slip properties and to facilitate unscrewing of the cap
Id
col. 1_ll._9 -14
However these compositions suffered the disadvantage of imparting bad odor and flavor to food products stored in contact with the compositions
Id
col. 1_ll._15 -17
The ¡¬863_patent explains that its compositions having specific amounts of polyethylene lubricants and additives solve this problem
Id
col. 1_ll._24 -35
Claim 1 is the only independent claim and is illustrative : 1
Composition comprising at least [ 1 ] 94.5 % by weight of a polyethylene with a standard_density of more than 940 kg/m3 [ 2 ] 0.BIG_TOKEN__05_to_0__BIG_TOKEN5 % by weight of at least one saturated fatty_acid_amide represented by CH3 ( CH2 ) nCONH2 in which n ranges from 6_to_28 [ ] [ 3 ] 0_to_015 % by weight of a subsidiary_lubricant selected from fatty acids fatty acid esters fatty acid salts mono-unsaturated fatty_acid_amides polyols containing at least 4 carbon atoms mono-or poly-alcohol monoethers glycerol esters paraffins polysiloxanes fluoropolymers and mixtures thereof and
[ 4 ] 0_to_5 % by weight of one or more additives selected from antioxidants antacids UV stabilizers colorants and antistatic agents
For ease of reference we refer to the various limitations by the respective bracketed numbers inserted into the claim

Ineos alleged that Berry_Plastics infringes claims 1-BIG_TOKEN__7_and_9__BIG_TOKEN -11 of the ¡¬863_patent
Berry_Plastics moved for summary_judgment that the asserted claims are anticipated independently by various prior_art references including U.S. Patent No._5948,846
The parties do not dispute that the ¡¬846_patent discloses 94.5 % by weight of a polyethylene with a standard_density of more than 940 kg/m3 as described in limitation 1 of claim 1 of the ¡¬863_patent
Ineos_USA_LLC v. Berry_Plastics Corp. No._13- cv-0017 Slip op.at 871 ( S.D
Tex
Apr._15,_2014 ) ECF No._101 ( Summary Judgment Order )
Likewise there is no dispute that stearamide disclosed in the ¡¬846_patent is a compound within the class of saturated fatty_acid_amides represented by CH3 ( CH2 ) nCONH2 in which n ranges from 6_to_28 ( `` primary_lubricant '' ) described in limitation 2
The court found that the ¡¬846_patent 's disclosure of a lubricant which could be stearamide in amounts from 0.BIG_TOKEN__1_to_5__BIG_TOKEN parts by weight,1 and more specifically of `` at least 0.1 part by weight per 100 parts by weight of polyolefin in particular of at least 0.2 parts by weight quantities of at least 0.4 parts by weight being the most common ones '' describes specific values ( e.g. 0.1 part by weight ) along with the broader disclosure of the full range ( 0.BIG_TOKEN__1_to_5__BIG_TOKEN parts by weight )
Id.at 13-14
It therefore concluded that the ¡¬846_patent 's disclosure of stearamide in these amounts met limitation 2
Id.at 11-14
It then determined that the subsidiary_lubricant of limitation 3 and the additive of limitation 4 are optional in the claimed composition because limitations 3_and_4 set forth ranges beginning with 0 %
Id.at 14-16
It therefore found that the ¡¬846_patent 's disclosure of an optional_subsidiary_lubricant and an optional additive satisfied limitations 3_and_4
Id
The court concluded that the ¡¬846_patent anticipates the asserted claims
Ineos_appeals
