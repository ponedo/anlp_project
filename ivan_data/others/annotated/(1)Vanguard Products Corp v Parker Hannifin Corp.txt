United States Court of Appeals Federal Circuit
VANGUARD PRODUCTS CORPORATION Plaintiff-Appellee v. PARKER HANNIFIN CORPORATION Defendant-Appellant
No._99-1427
| Dec._14,_2000
| Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc Denied Jan._25,_2001
* Synopsis
Patentee brought action against competitor alleging infringement of patent claiming an electromagnetic_interference_shielding_gasket
The United States District Court for the District of Connecticut Alfred V. Covello Chief_Judge entered judgment upon jury_verdict in favor of patentee and competitor appealed
The Court of Appeals Pauline Newman Circuit_Judge held that term `` integral '' in patent 's reference to a thick inner elastomeric layer and a thin outer elastomeric layer `` integral_therewith '' did not require that gasket be made by co-extrusion manufacturing method

Affirmed

PAULINE_NEWMAN Circuit_Judge
Vanguard Products Corporation owner of United States Patent No._4968,854 ( the ¡¬854_patent ) charged Parker_Hannifin_Corporation with infringement
After construction of the claims by the district_court the jury held the patent valid and willfully infringed and determined damages
The court entered judgment on the verdicts enjoined continuing infringement and denied Vanguard 's motions for enhanced damages and attorney fees.1 Parker_Hannifin appeals stating that the court 's claim_construction is incorrect and that on the correct construction infringement can not be found
Parker_Hannifin does not appeal the jury_verdict as based on the district_court 's claim_construction

CLAIM CONSTRUCTION
The ¡¬854_patent is directed to an electromagnetic_interference_shielding_gasket
Claim 1 the broadest claim describes the gasket as having two elastomeric_layers : a thick inner_layer and a thin metal-filled outer_layer `` integral_therewith '' : 1
In a gasket_shield for counteracting electromagnetic interference comprising a flexible gasket element the improvement wherein said gasket element comprises a relatively thick elastomeric layer of good elasticity and high tear resistance and a relatively thin elastomeric outer_layer integral_therewith said outer_layer being metal filled and providing a high degree of attenuation of electrical energy
The dispositive issue of claim_construction is whether the term `` integral_therewith '' requires that the product be made by co-extrusion,2 the method of manufacture described in the specification
The accused shielding gasket is conceded by Parker_Hannifin to contain inner and outer elastomeric_layers of the same properties as described and claimed in the ¡¬854_patent but the method of manufacture differs in that for the Parker_Hannifin gasket the outer_layer is applied to the inner_layer by dip-coating

The district_court ruled on review of the ¡¬854_specification the prosecution_history and a dictionary_definition of `` integral '' that the claimed gasket_shield is not limited to manufacture by co-extrusion
The court instructed the jury as follows : '' Integral '' is used here in its ordinary sense to mean formed as a unit with another part and therefore `` integral_therewith '' means that the outer_layer of the gasket is formed as a unit and in direct contact with the inner_layer of the gasket
Parker_Hannifin argues that `` integral_therewith '' requires the use of co-extrusion to manufacture the gasket the only process shown in the specification and that a claim not so limited would read on the prior_art and would violate the written description requirement of 35 U.S.C.¡± 112 & 1
Parker_Hannifin states that the district_court improperly resorted to a dictionary_definition of `` integral '' to broaden the *1372 meaning of this term from the context in which it was used
Parker_Hannifin also states that the dictionary was improper extrinsic evidence

A dictionary is not prohibited extrinsic evidence and is an available resource of claim_construction
Although a dictionary_definition may not enlarge the scope of a term when the specification and the prosecution_history show that the inventor or recognized usage in the field of the invention have given the term a limited or specialized meaning a dictionary is often useful to aid the court in determining the correct meaning to be ascribed to a term as it was used
See Hockerson-Halberstadt Inc. v. Avia Group Int ' l Inc. 222_F.3d_951 955 55_USPQ2d_1487 1490 ( Fed.Cir.2000 ) ; Multiform Desiccants Inc. v. Medzam Ltd. 133_F.3d_1473 1478 45_USPQ2d_1429 1432 ( Fed.Cir.1998 )

We discern no error in the district_court 's determination that `` integral '' was used in the ¡¬854_patent in its ordinary dictionary meaning
See Optical Disc Corp. v. Del Mar Avionics 208_F.3d_13241335 54_USPQ2d_1289 1295 ( Fed.Cir.2000 ) ( a dictionary provides objective definition when words are used in their ordinary meaning )
The ¡¬854_specification shows that the term was used to describe the product and not as a designation of a specific manufacturing process

Parker_Hannifin argues that the prosecution_history shows that the Vanguard_inventors viewed co-extrusion as `` fundamental '' to manufacture of the claimed gasket thereby imposing this process of manufacture upon the product_claims
Parker_Hannifin states that the inventors argued the benefits of co-extruded layers in order to overcome the prior_art of Zulaf Severinsen and Bogan and thus must be deemed to have disclaimed other methods of producing the gasket
However review of the prosecution_history shows that during examination the examiner as well as the applicant treated the product_claims as directed to the product itself and examined the application accordingly
For example in responding to the Zulaf reference the inventors pointed out that the Zulaf product was porous while theirs was solid and pointed to other differences between the claimed and reference products
In addition the inventors distinguished the Severinsen and other references in the Information Disclosure Statement based on the structure and composition of the products
Severinsen for example describes a metal-filled elastomer embedded with knitted wire mesh and was criticized by the inventors for its poorer performance and higher cost
The examiner did not cite any reference directed to co-extrusion or the method of manufacture

The prosecution_history shows that the inventors extolled the economy of manufacture and superior product made by co-extrusion and told the examiner that `` our system requires only a one-step process as a result of the co-extrusion and tri-extrusion process ''
However the prosecution_history does not support Parker_Hannifin 's argument that the Vanguard_inventors `` expressly disclaimed '' claim scope beyond products made by co-extrusion
Patent claim 10 specifically describes the gasket layers as `` co-extruded ''
The district_court correctly declined to read this limitation into claim 1
See Tandon Corp. v. United States Int ' l Trade Comm ' n 831_F.2d_1017 1023 4_USPQ2d_1283 1288 ( Fed.Cir.1987 ) ( claims containing different limitations are presumed to be of different scope )

The method of manufacture even when cited as advantageous does not of itself convert product_claims into claims limited to a particular process
We agree with the district_court that the word `` integral '' describes the relationship between the elastomeric_layers not the means of joining them
This word did not limit the claim to the manufacturing process set forth in the specification
A novel product that meets the criteria of patentability is not limited to the process by which it was made
See 3 Donald S. Chisum Chisum *1373 on Patents ¡± 8.05 at 8-79 ( 2000 ) and cases cited therein

Parker_Hannifin states that the district_court inappropriately relied on Serrano v. Telular Corp. 111_F.3d_1578 42_USPQ2d_1538_(Fed.Cir.1997) and failed to correctly apply Southwall Technologies Inc. v. Cardinal IG Co. 54_F.3d_1570 34_USPQ2d_1673_(Fed.Cir.1995) in its claim_construction
These criticisms are not well founded
The Serrano litigation concerned both a product ( system ) and a process and also involved `` means-for '' terms under 35 U.S.C.¡± 112 & 6
The district_court herein correctly recognized these differences and correctly applied the reasoning of Serrano to distinguish product and method limitations
In Southwall the claims required a `` sputter-deposited dialectic '' thereby including the sputter-deposit method as an explicit limitation in the invention as it was claimed
This is analogous to claim 10 of the ¡¬854_patent
However the co-extrusion limitation is not included in claim 1

We discern no error in the district_court 's reading of the patent and its prosecution_history and application of law and precedent
We conclude that the district_court correctly construed claim 1 in the instruction to the jury
On this claim_construction the jury_verdict is not appealed
The judgment entered thereon is affirmed
