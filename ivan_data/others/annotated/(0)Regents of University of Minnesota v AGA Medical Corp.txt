United States Court of Appeals Federal Circuit
REGENTS OF the UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA Plaintiff-Appellant v. AGA MEDICAL CORPORATION Defendant-Appellee
No._2012-1167
| June_3,_2013
Synopsis
Background : Patentee filed action against competitor alleging infringement of patents directed to medical_devices for repairing heart_defects
The United States District Court for the District of Minnesota Patrick J. Schiltz J. 660_F.Supp.2d_1037 construed disputed terms partially granted competitor 's motion for summary_judgment of noninfringement 2011_WL_13943 and then granted competitor 's motion for summary_judgment of invalidity
Patentee appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Dyk Circuit_Judge held that :

phrase `` first and second_occluding_disks '' meant physically distinct and separate first and second_occluding_disks ;

patent had not been infringed by accused product ;

prior_art that contained two umbrella-shaped parts oriented like umbrellas joined at their tips anticipated claims of patent ;

patentee 's disclaimer during prosecution of prior patent applications regarding use of radial frame as equivalent of peripheral frame for medical device for repairing heart_defects did not carry forward to means-plus-function language used in subsequent application that contained different claim limitation than its predecessors and captured different subject matter ;

phrase `` at least a substantial_portion of the central_portion of the first member '' be `` in communication with at least a substantial_portion of the second member '' required that substantial_portions of central_portions of members communicated `` movement '' ;

patentee waived any objection to aspect of district_court 's construction on claim of anticipation that allegedly wrongly allowed translational movement communicated between prior_art 's members to satisfy `` in communication with '' claim limitation ; and

patentee was barred from making argument on appeal that `` central_portion '' of each member in patent directed to medical_devices for repairing heart_defects had to fill septal_defect and that prior_art 's hub did not satisfy that requirement

Affirmed

Opinion
DYK Circuit_Judge
Appellant Regents of the University of Minnesota ( `` the University '' ) owns U.S._Patent_No._6077,281 ( `` the ¡¬281_patent `` ) and U.S._Patent_No._6077,291 ( `` the ¡¬291_patent `` ) which are directed to medical_devices for repairing heart_defects
The University accused AGA_Medical Corporation ( `` AGA '' ) of infringing both patents
After claim construction the district_court granted summary_judgment that the ¡¬291_patent was not infringed and that the asserted claims of the ¡¬281_patent were invalid as anticipated
The University appeals arguing that the district_court erred in its construction of the claims of the ¡¬291_patent and in finding the ¡¬281_patent anticipated by a prior_art device
We affirm

BACKGROUND
The ¡¬291 and ¡¬281_patent s are directed toward `` septal_occluders '' which are medical_devices used to block holes in a thin wall of muscle and tissue ( a `` septum '' ) dividing two chambers of the heart
`` Transcatheter '' septal_occluders can be delivered to the heart and positioned in a septal_defect using a catheter threaded through a vein
In 1975 King and Mills received a patent on the first transcatheter septal occluder ( `` the King device '' )
U.S. Pat
No._3874,388 ( filed Feb._12,_1973 )

In 1992 the University filed Patent Application No._07 /822,951 ( `` the ¡¬951_application '' ) claiming a transcatheter septal occluder invented by Dr. Gladwin Das
Four patents eventually issued from successive *933 divisions of the ¡¬951_application including U.S. Patent No._5334,217 ( `` the ¡¬217_patent `` ) issued in April 1994 another patent not at issue here and the ¡¬291 and ¡¬281_patent s which were both issued in June 2000
The patents have different claims but generally share the same specification
The `` Summary of the Invention '' explains that the claimed device has `` first and second_occluding_disks which are attached to one another '' centrally
¡¬291_patent_col. 3_ll._7 -8 ; ¡¬281_patent_col. 3_ll._11 -12
Each disk comprises a membrane and a frame and can be `` collapsed '' to fit in a catheter
¡¬291_patent_col. 3_ll._8 -12
The device is delivered through the catheter to the heart where it is positioned with one disk on each side of the defective_septum
As the catheter is withdrawn the disks expand covering both sides of the defective_septum and blocking the hole
See id.at col. 3_ll._10 -14
The patents ' shared specification acknowledges prior_art septal_occluders with expandable membranes including the patented King device and a device described in an article by Dr. James Lock ( `` the Lock device '' )
The Lock and King devices both have `` umbrella-like '' structures mounted on radial frames
The specification of the patents-in-suit disparages prior_art radial frame devices as `` mechanically complex and requir [ ing ] a great deal of remote manipulation for deployment '' ¡¬ 291 patent col. 2_ll._44 -45 ; ¡¬281_patent_col. 2_ll._48 -49 and because the `` single point or pivot '' connecting the two umbrella structures can drift within the septal_defect allowing the device to become decentered
¡¬291_patent_col. 2_ll._52 -56 ; ¡¬281_patent_col. 2_ll._56 -60

In 2007 the University filed suit against AGA alleging infringement of the ¡¬291 and ¡¬281_patent s. AGA 's accused septal_occluders are one-piece devices made from tubes of wire mesh
The mesh is molded into a preset_shape with two large flat regions separated by a narrow waist
The device can be compressed into an elongated shape to fit in a catheter
Upon deployment from the catheter inside the heart the device spontaneously springs back to the preset_shape and blocks the septal_defect

At the parties ' request the district_court held a Markman hearing and construed various disputed terms in the ¡¬291 and ¡¬281_patent s. See Regents of the Univ
of Minn. v. AGA_Med Corp. 660_F.Supp.2d_1037 ( D.Minn.2009 )
In January 2011 the court partially granted AGA 's motion for summary_judgment of noninfringement ruling that no reasonable jury could find that AGA 's one-piece mesh device infringed the ¡¬291_patent
Regents of the Univ
of Minn. v. AGA_Med Corp. No._07 -CV-4732 2011_WL_13943 at *9 *15-16 ( D.Minn
Jan._4,_2011 )
In December 2011 the court granted AGA 's motion for summary_judgment of invalidity with respect to asserted claims 1 4 and 5 of the ¡¬281_patent Regents of the Univ
of Minn. v. AGA_Med Corp. 835_F.Supp.2d_711_(D.Minn.2011) finding that all three claims were anticipated by the prior_art Lock device id.at 723-26.1 The district_court dismissed AGA 's remaining counterclaims as moot
Id.at 713-14.2 The University *934 timely appealed and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
Although the patents in this case are related they present distinct legal issues on appeal so we discuss them separately
