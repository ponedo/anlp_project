Defendant-Appellant Doc 's Marketing Corp. ( `` Doc 's '' ) appeals the decision of the United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of Ohio granting a preliminary_injunction in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee Erico_Int ' l_Corp. ( `` Erico '' )
Erico_Int ' l_Corp. v. Doc 's Mktg. Inc. 1:05-cv-2924 2006_WL_1174259_(N.D.Ohio_May_3,_2006) ( `` Initial_Order `` ) ; Erico_Int ' l_Corp. *1352 v. Doc 's Mktg. Inc. 1:05-cv-2924 2007_WL_108450_(N.D.Ohio_Jan._9,_2007) ( `` Reconsideration Order `` )
Because this court finds that Doc 's has raised a substantial_question as to the validity of the patent at issue this court vacates the preliminary_injunction

I. Erico develops and manufactures a variety of fasteners used in the installation of electrical and communications cables for commercial buildings and other facilities
In particular Erico sells a popular J-Hook fastener
The J-Hook offered in different strengths and sizes is a metal device that supports lengths of cable
Erico through the inventor Raymond Scott Laughlin obtained U.S. Patent No._5740,994 ( `` the ¡¬994_patent `` ) on its J-Hook and the method for its use
The ¡¬994_patent issued on April 21 1998 from an application filed on December 26 1996
Figure 6 of the ¡¬994_patent illustrates the J-Hook :

?
Erico does not assert infringement of the apparatus claim to the J-Hook but asserts claim 17 the method of using the J-Hook
Claim 17 reads : A method of supporting a run of a bundle of low voltage communication cable comprising the steps of providing spaced supports each comprised of a curved saddle having smooth down-turned obtuse angle lateral edges suspending the run from saddle to saddle and spacing the saddles along the run so that the run sags between saddles no more than about 30 cm below the saddles
¡¬994_Patent col.9 ll.61-67 ( emphasis added )
Figure 18 from the ¡¬994_patent illustrates the method : *1353. ?
In January 2000 the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( `` PTO '' ) reexamined the ¡¬994_patent in Reexamination No._90 /005,606
Based on the reexamination the PTO cancelled numerous apparatus claims on the J-Hook
Specifically the PTO found the apparatus claims obvious under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103 in light of three references-Akashi et al
( JP ¡¬290 ) 3-89290 Sep. 11 1991 ( Japanese Kokai Patent ) ; Erico `` For Communications & Low Voltage Applications '' pp
3-26 ( 1994 ) ; and OBO Bettermann Publication p. 243 and `` Cable Support Clips '' p. 18
Ex parte Raimond Scott Laughlin Appeal No.2002-0244 ( heard on May_14,_2002 )
The Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences ( `` Board '' ) affirmed the cancellations
Claim 17 survived the reexamination process

Doc 's manufactures a variety of hardware items and specifically manufactures and sells J-Hooks
Doc 's concedes that its J-Hook copies Erico 's J-Hook
In 2005 Erico discovered that Doc 's was selling a copy of its J-Hook and informed Doc 's
At first Doc 's assured Erico that it would not sell its existing J-Hook inventory
Doc 's also assured Erico that it would refrain from future copying and selling of J-Hooks
`` Thereafter however [ Doc 's ] sold the very products it promised to retain and continued to manufacture and sell knock off J-Hooks ''
Initial_Order slip op.at *5
Erico filed suit to enjoin Doc 's alleged infringement of Claim 17 of the ¡¬994_patent
Doc 's then challenged Claim 17 's validity
