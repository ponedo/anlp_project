Patent owners appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Reyna Circuit_Judge held that :

`` first set of rules '' in patents were limited to rules evaluating sub-sequences consisting of multiple sequential phonemes

patent claims were limited to rules with specific common characteristics i.e. genus rather than covering all rules ; and

patent claim was not directed to abstract_idea and did not merely invoke generic processes and machinery thus favoring patentability

Reversed and remanded

Before Reyna Taranto and Stoll Circuit_Judges
Opinion
Reyna Circuit_Judge
This appeal is from a grant of judgment on the pleadings under Fed
R. Civ
P. 12 ( c ) that the asserted claims of U.S. Patent Nos._6307,576 ( `` the '576_patent `` ) and 6,611,278 ( `` the '278_patent `` ) are invalid
The United_States_District_Court for the Central_District of California found that the asserted claims are directed to patent-ineligible subject matter and are therefore invalid under 35 U.S.C.¡± 101 ( `` ¡± 101 '' )
McRO Inc. v. Sony Computer Entm't Am. LLC 55_F.Supp.3d_1214 ( C.D
Cal
2014 ) ( `` Patentability Op `` )
We hold that the ordered combination of claimed steps *1303 using unconventional rules that relate sub-sequences of phonemes timings and morph weight sets is not directed to an abstract_idea and is therefore patent-eligible subject matter under ¡± 101
Accordingly we reverse
