Opinion
DYK Circuit_Judge
Victoria 's Secret_Direct_Brand_Management LLC ( `` Victoria 's Secret '' ) and Avon_Products Inc. ( `` Avon '' ) ( collectively `` defendants '' ) appeal from a judgment of the District Court for the Eastern_District of Texas
The district_court found that defendants infringed claims 34_and_51 of U.S._Patent_No._5715,314 ( the `` ¡¬314_patent `` ) and claims 15 17 and 39 of U.S._Patent_No._5909,492 ( the `` ¡¬492_patent `` ) and that those claims were not invalid

After the district_court 's judgment this court decided Soverain_Software_LLC v. Newegg_Inc. 705_F.3d_1333_(Fed.Cir.2013) amended on reh ' g 728_F.3d_1332 1336 ( Fed.Cir.2013 ) ( hereinafter `` Newegg `` )
There we held invalid as obvious_claims 34_and_51 of the ¡¬314_patent and claims 17 41 and 61 of the ¡¬492_patent
Id.at 1341 1344
We hold that issue_preclusion applies as a result of the Newegg case and that the asserted claims here are therefore invalid
Accordingly we reverse

BACKGROUND
Soverain_Software_LLC ( `` Soverain '' ) is the assignee of the ¡¬314 and ¡¬492_patent s. It brought an infringement action against defendants in the Eastern_District of Texas
The asserted claims fall into two categories
Claims 34_and_51 of the ¡¬314_patent and claim 17 of the ¡¬492_patent are directed to virtual_shopping_carts.BIG_TOKEN__1_Claims_15__BIG_TOKEN and 39 of the ¡¬492_patent are directed to *1314 using a hypertext_statement so that users can access information about past orders.2

On November 18 2011 a jury determined that defendants infringed the asserted claims and that those claims were not invalid as anticipated or obvious
The district_court subsequently entered judgment in favor of Soverain
Defendants appealed on September 7 2012

Subsequent to the filing of the appeal on January 22 2013 this court decided Newegg a case from the Eastern_District of Texas in which Soverain also alleged infringement of the ¡¬314 and ¡¬492_patent s. There the district_court had entered judgment that the asserted claims were infringed and not invalid
On appeal we reversed holding invalid as obvious_claims 34_and_51 of the ¡¬314_patent and claims 17 41 and 61 of the ¡¬492_patent
Newegg 705_F.3d_1333 at 1347
In a subsequent panel rehearing decision we clarified that claim 35 is also invalid
We `` confirm [ ed ] that claim 34 is representative of the 'shopping cart ' claims including claim 35 and conclude [ d ] that dependent_claim 35 is invalid on the ground of obviousness ''
Soverain_Software_LLC v. Newegg_Inc. 728_F.3d_1332 1336 ( Fed.Cir.2013 ) ( hereinafter `` Newegg II `` )3

We apply the law of the regional circuit to the general procedural question of whether issue_preclusion applies
RF Del. Inc. v. Pac
Keystone Techs. Inc. 326_F.3d_1255 1261 ( Fed.Cir.2003 )
We apply this court 's precedent to questions involving substantive issues of patent law issues of issue_preclusion that implicate substantive patent law issues or issues of issue_preclusion that implicate the scope of our own previous decisions
