Mark_Bruckelmyer appeals from the decision of the United_States_District_Court for the District of Minnesota granting summary_judgment of invalidity of U.S
Patents 5,567 085_and_5820,301 ( the `` patents in suit '' ) in favor of Ground_Heaters Inc. and T.H.E
Machine_Company ( collectively `` Ground_Heaters '' )
Bruckelmyer v. Ground_Heaters Inc. No._02-_CV-1761 2005_WL_1155938 ( D.Minn
May_13,_2005 ) ( `` Final_Decision `` )
Prior to the district court 's entry of judgment Bruckelmyer stipulated that if the Canadian_patent_application that issued as Canadian_Patent 1,158,119 ( `` the '119 application '' ) were a `` printed publication '' under 35 U.S.C.¡± 102 ( b ) it would render the patents in suit invalid on the ground of obviousness
Id. slip op.at 6
Because the court correctly determined that the '119 application including figures 3_and_4 contained therein was a `` printed publication '' we affirm its judgment of invalidity

BACKGROUND
On July_20,_1995 a patent application that issued as the '085_patent was filed in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office naming Mark_Bruckelmyer as the inventor
On July_17,_1996 a continuation-in-part application that issued as the *1376 '301_patent was filed also naming Bruckelmyer as the inventor
Both patents disclose a method of thawing frozen_ground so that a layer of concrete can be laid on top of the ground
'085_patent col._1,_ll._34-51 ; '301_patent col._1,_ll._34-51
According to the patents in cold weather the laying of concrete is difficult because it may harden in a non-uniform manner and concrete laid on frozen_ground may later crack due to settling of the ground that thaws in warmer weather
'085_patent col._1,_ll._10-26 ; '301_patent col._1,_ll._10-26
In general the patented methods place rubber hoses on the ground either around a narrow concrete footing form or within a large concrete form
'085_patent col._2,_l._25- col._3,_l._58 ; '301_patent col._2,_l._25- col._4,_l._15
A liquid that is heated such as water or antifreeze is then circulated through the hoses which thaws the frozen_ground and prevents the concrete from hardening too quickly
Id

On May_7,_1982 over thirteen years before Bruckelmyer filed the applications that issued as the '085 and '301_patent s Norman Young filed an application that issued as Canadian_Patent 1,158,119
The '119_patent subsequently issued on December 6 1983
The '119_patent discloses a portable heating_system that places flexible_hoses `` in close proximity to objects of various shapes and configurations which would otherwise be difficult to heat ''
'119_patent abstract
Like the patents in suit the '119_patent discloses a method of heating structures by having preheated liquid flow through flexible_hoses
Also similar to the patents in suit the '119_patent states that the `` primary object of this invention is to provide an improved method of applying heat to fresh concrete which has been placed in pre-constructed formwork during extreme cold weather ''
Id
To illustrate an application of the invention the '119_patent provides drawings of the claimed heating_system being used to heat a beam
The patent further notes that the `` system is suitable for applying heat to other subjects and is not necessarily confined to use in relation to concrete placement
Other typical uses are :.. thawing frozen_ground ''
Id. at p. 2
Relevant to this appeal the '119_patent omits certain drawings that were contained in the application as filed viz. two drawings illustrating the use of the disclosed heating_system to thaw frozen_ground ( `` figures 3_and_4 `` )
Figures 3_and_4 are not in the issued patent because they were cancelled during prosecution
Nonetheless they still remain in the '119_patent 's file_wrapper

Moving forward to July_15,_2002 Bruckelmyer filed a complaint against Ground_Heaters one of his former licensees for infringement of the patents in suit
In its responsive pleading Ground_Heaters filed a counterclaim asserting that the patents in suit were invalid.1 On December 19 2002 Ground_Heaters filed a motion for summary_judgment of invalidity based on inter alia figures 3_and_4 of the '119 application
The court denied Ground_Heaters ' motion for summary_judgment of invalidity upon finding a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have been enabled by figures 3_and_4 to practice the technology claimed by the patents in suit without undue experimentation
Bruckelmyer v. Ground_Heaters Inc. No._02-_CV-1761 slip op.at 8 2003_WL_21402870_(D._Minn._June_16,_2003) ( `` Initial Decision `` )

In reaching its decision to deny summary_judgment the court determined that the '119 application was a `` printed publication '' *1377 under ¡± 102 ( b )
Id
The court noted that the '119_patent and its application were available for public inspection at the Canadian_Patent Office in Hull Quebec more than one year before the priority date of the patents in suit
Id
The court also determined albeit in a conclusory manner that `` the contents of the file_wrapper [ were ] sufficiently accessible to the relevant and interested public as to constitute a printed publication for purposes of ¡± 102 ( b ) ''
Id

In view of the court 's determination that figures 3_and_4 of the '119 application constituted ¡± 102 ( b ) prior art Bruckelmyer filed a stipulation in the court conceding that those figures rendered the claims of the patents in suit invalid
Final_Decision slip op.at 6
In doing so Bruckelmyer removed from dispute any question of fact as to whether those figures were enabling to a person of ordinary_skill in the pertinent art
Ground_Heaters filed a renewed motion for summary_judgment of invalidity which the court granted on May_13,_2005
Id
Bruckelmyer timely appealed and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )2
