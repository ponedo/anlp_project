Opinion
GAJARSA Circuit_Judge
This is the second time we have heard an appeal in this case
In the previous appeal Liquid Dynamics ( `` LD '' ) contested the claim_construction and summary_judgment of non-infringement entered against it
Liquid Dynamics Corp. v. Vaughan Co. 355_F.3d_1361 ( Fed.Cir.2004 ) ( `` LD I `` )
In that decision we found error in the district_court 's claim_construction vacated the grant of summary_judgment and remanded for proceedings based on the revised claim_construction
Id

On remand the district_court held a six-day jury trial to determine whether Vaughan Company Inc. ( `` Vaughan '' ) infringed claims 1_and_8 of U.S. Patent No._5458,414 ( `` the '414_patent `` ) and whether the '414_patent was valid
On October 25 *1213 2004 the jury returned a verdict that Vaughan had infringed the '414_patent that the infringement was willful and that Vaughan failed to prove that the '414_patent was invalid
The jury awarded damages to LD in the amount of $ 1,183,722

Subsequently the district_court held a bench trial on Vaughan 's allegation of inequitable_conduct but granted LD 's motion for judgment as a matter of law on that issue at the close of evidence
Final judgment was entered on November 15 2004 and the district_court subsequently denied Vaughan 's judgment-as-a-matter-of-law ( `` JMOL '' ) and new-trial motions on the issues of invalidity infringement and willfulness
Thereafter the district_court granted in part LD 's motions for enhanced damages and attorney 's fees
The court trebled the jury 's damage award based upon the jury 's willfulness finding and `` Vaughan 's behavior as a litigant ''
Separately the court awarded attorney 's fees amounting to $ 1,501,239
The court also entered a permanent_injunction on February 25 2005

Vaughan now appeals the district_court 's denial of its JMOL motion for non-infringement invalidity no willful_infringement and unenforceability due to inequitable_conduct
Further Vaughan appeals the district_court 's orders for a permanent_injunction enhanced damages and attorney 's fees
For the reasons stated below we affirm the judgment of the district_court

BACKGROUND
The '414_patent involves a system of pumps that stir mixtures of solids and liquids in large 1,000,000-gallon tanks
The invention is primarily directed to applications for mixing wastewater and manure
Because we have already detailed the invention and its background in LD I we reproduce only a summary of the relevant facts below : This case involves the structure of slurry tanks
Slurry tanks are used to store and process chemicals and organic waste products ( e.g. manure ) that retain value as useful inputs ( e.g. fertilizer ) into other processes
Large storage_tanks house these waste_compounds in liquid or semisolid form between their production and their subsequent use
The liquid and solid components of these waste_compounds tend to separate when stored with solid particles either forming a crust on the top of the tank and/or falling to the bottom of the tank
Productive use of the stored compound requires remixing both to suspend the heavy solid particles within the liquid and to ensure that the resulting suspension is uniform
One standard approach has been to stir the mix continuously to avoid settling
Because continuous mixing can be expensive however tank designers sought ways to store the mixtures in a still tank to allow the settling to occur and to remix only when necessary for use
The '414_patent addressed these concerns
