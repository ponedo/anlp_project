BRYSON Circuit_Judge
Wm
Wrigley Jr. Co. and Cadbury Adams USA LLC compete in the consumer market for chewing_gum
This case involves chewing_gum that provides a cooling sensation when chewed
Historically chewing_gum makers have achieved that cooling sensation ( known as `` physiological cooling '' ) by adding menthol to their products
Menthol however has disadvantages including a strong peppermint flavor and bitterness in high concentrations
During the 1970s and 1980s Wilkinson-Sword Ltd. attempted to develop physiological cooling agents that would not have the drawbacks of menthol
The result was two such coolants which were released under the trade names `` WS-3 '' and `` WS-23 ''
Wrigley and Cadbury each own a patent that generally claims chewing_gum containing a combination of menthol and one of those coolants
Cadbury owns U.S._Patent_No._5009,893 ( `` the ¡¬893_patent `` ) which claims a chewing_gum that combines menthol with WS-3
Wrigley owns U.S. Patent No._6627,233 ( `` the ¡¬233_patent `` ) which claims a chewing_gum that combines menthol with WS-23

The application that matured into Cadbury 's ¡¬893_patent was filed in July 1989
Claim 1 one of two independent claims of the ¡¬893_patent recites : 1
A chewing_gum composition capable of providing long-lasting breath freshening perception without bitterness comprising a gum base a sweetener and a cooling composition comprising menthol and an N-substituted-p-menthane_carboxamide of [ a specific formula ]

WS-3 is an N-substituted-p-menthane_carboxamide and one of the compounds described by the formula recited in claim 1
The claim therefore reads on chewing_gum that combines WS-3 ( and other N-substituted-p-menthane_carboxamides of *1359 the recited formula ) and menthol
The patent 's specification discloses that although the cooling effect of both menthol and WS-3 were known in the prior_art the combination of the two `` results in an unexpected heightened cooling sensation in edible products ''
Cadbury introduced into the market a variety of chewing_gum_products that embody the claims of the ¡¬893_patent
Those products did well in the marketplace

After Cadbury introduced its WS-3/menthol chewing_gum Wrigley introduced a chewing_gum that combined menthol and WS-23
That product was the commercial embodiment of claim 34 of Wrigley 's ¡¬233_patent
The application for the ¡¬ 233 patent was filed in March 2000
Claim 34 recites : 34
A chewing_gum composition comprising : a ) about 5 % to about 95 % gum base ; b ) about 5 % to about 95 % bulking and sweetening agent ; and
c ) about 0.1 [ % ] to about 10 % flavoring agent wherein the flavoring agent comprises N-2,3-trimethyl-2-isopropyl_butanamide and menthol
WS-23 is the trade name for N-2,3-trimethyl-2-isopropyl_butanamide

Following the introduction of Wrigley 's WS-23/menthol chewing_gum Cadbury reformulated some of its chewing_gum_products
Cadbury 's reformulated chewing_gum contained both WS-23 and menthol
Wrigley then filed suit against Cadbury in the United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of Illinois accusing Cadbury 's reformulated chewing_gum of infringing the ¡¬233_patent
Cadbury counterclaimed accusing Wrigley 's chewing_gum of infringing Cadbury 's ¡¬893_patent

Wrigley and Cadbury each moved for summary_judgment on a number of issues
Cadbury sought summary_judgment declaring claim 34 of the ¡¬233_patent invalid for obviousness and anticipation
Wrigley sought summary_judgment declaring that it had not infringed the asserted claims of the ¡¬893_patent2

The district_court granted Wrigley 's motion for summary_judgment of noninfringement of the ¡¬893_patent
The court first noted that WS-23 is not an N-substituted-p-menthane_carboxamide so a combination of WS-23 and menthol would not literally infringe the ¡¬893_patent
The court further found that the ¡¬893_patent narrowly claimed the combination of N-substituted-p-menthane_carboxamides and menthol and that it implicitly excluded other carboxamides including WS-23
The court therefore held that a combination of WS-23 and menthol did not infringe the ¡¬893_patent under the doctrine of equivalents

Addressing Cadbury 's summary_judgment motion the district_court concluded that claim 34 of the ¡¬233_patent was invalid on grounds of anticipation and obviousness
The court held claim 34 to be anticipated by U.S._Patent_No._5688,491 ( `` Shahidi '' ) and obvious in view of U.S._Patent_No._5698,181 ( `` Luo '' ) and an article written by Dr. M.A
Parrish ( `` Parrish '' )

Shahidi is directed to a variety of oral compositions each of which contains xylitol and copper bis-glycinate
The compositions *1360 include chewing_gum as well as other compositions such as toothpaste mouth rinses and lozenges
Shahidi lists several categories of components that can be included in the compositions
They include both `` essential '' and `` optional '' ( or `` nonessential '' ) components ; certain of the optional components are noted as `` preferred ''
A `` cooling agent or combination of cooling agents '' is such a `` preferred nonessential '' component
Some of the categories further identify certain specific components as `` preferred ''
Within the category of cooling agents Shahidi discloses WS-3 and WS-23 as two of three `` particularly preferred cooling agents ''
Shahidi also discloses menthol as one of 23 listed flavoring agents that can be used in the claimed compositions

The district_court found that Shahidi discloses every limitation of claim 34
In making that determination the district_court relied on a patent incorporated by reference into Shahidi which provided a range for the amount of WS-23 to include in a composition
That range is a subset of the range for the amount of flavoring agent recited in claim 34
The court further ruled that Shahidi would have disclosed to one of ordinary_skill in the art how to create a cooling chewing_gum with component amounts in the ranges claimed by claim 34
The court therefore held that Shahidi anticipated claim 34

Luo discloses chewing_gum that achieves a cooling effect by combining WS-3 and menthol and it also discloses combining N-substituted-p-menthane_carboxamides with menthol
Parrish which was published in 1987 describes WS-3 and WS-23 as potential replacements for menthol in a variety of applications including chewing_gum
Parrish highlights that both WS-3 and WS-23 have `` high cooling activity with no side-effects ''
Parrish does not distinguish the cooling activity of WS-3 and WS-23 although it notes that WS-3 but not WS-23 had been listed as `` generally regarded as safe '' by the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association ( `` FEMA '' )
That approval referred to as `` FEMA-GRAS listing '' was subsequently extended to WS-23

The district_court held that in light of the disclosures of Luo and Parrish the only novel aspect of claim 34 was the combination of menthol and WS-23
Although Parrish teaches substituting WS-23 for menthol rather than combining the two the court found that Parrish would have made it obvious to substitute WS-23 for WS-3 in the combination of menthol and WS-3 that was disclosed in Luo
The court also ruled that the evidence of secondary considerations proffered by Wrigley was not sufficient to overcome the strong showing of obviousness and establish that claim 34 was `` an invention appearing to have been obvious in light of the prior_art [ that ] was not ''
Stratoflex Inc. v. Aeroquip Corp. 713_F.2d_1530 1538 ( Fed.Cir.1983 )

I
On appeal Wrigley argues that Shahidi does not anticipate claim 34 for two reasons
First Wrigley argues that while Shahidi discloses all the claim limitations found in claim 34 it does not disclose them in the combination recited in that claim.3 Second and relatedly Wrigley argues *1361 that Shahidi would not have enabled a person of ordinary_skill in the art to derive the combination recited in claim 34 without undue_experimentation

For a prior_art_reference to anticipate a claim it must disclose all of the limitations of the claim `` arranged or combined in the same way as in the claim ''
Net_MoneyIN Inc. v. VeriSign Inc. 545_F.3d_1359 1370 ( Fed.Cir.2008 )
For example in Net_MoneyIN this court held that an `` Internet payment system '' was not anticipated by a prior_art_reference that disclosed all the components of the invention because the reference disclosed two separate payment protocols each of which contained only a subset of the components claimed in the patent at issue
Id.at 1371
Therefore the reference did not `` prove prior invention of the thing claimed ''
Id

In this case by contrast Shahidi envisions using WS-23 and menthol in a single product
While Shahidi discloses a number of different combinations of cooling and flavoring elements one of them is the combination of menthol which Shahidi identifies as one of the `` most suitable '' flavoring agents with WS-23 which Shahidi identifies along with WS-3 as among a group of three `` particularly preferred cooling agents ''
Based on the disclosure of the combination of those components we agree with the district_court that Shahidi anticipates claim 34

This is not a case in which the prior_art_reference merely discloses a genus and the claim at issue recites a species of that genus
In such a case the issue of anticipation turns on whether the genus was of such a defined and limited class that one of ordinary_skill in the art could `` at once envisage '' each member of the genus
Eli Lilly & Co. v. Zenith Goldline Pharm. Inc. 471_F.3d_1369 1376 ( Fed.Cir.2006 )
Shahidi specifically discloses WS-23 as a coolant and menthol as a flavoring agent
The question for purposes of anticipation is therefore whether the number of categories and components in Shahidi was so large that the combination of WS-23 and menthol would not be immediately apparent to one of ordinary_skill in the art
See Perricone v. Medicis Pharm Corp. 432_F.3d_1368 1377 ( Fed.Cir.2005 ) ( distinguishing cases in which a prior_art_reference discloses a genus from those in which it discloses a number of species as part of a list )

Wrigley argues that Impax Laboratories Inc. v. Aventis Pharmaceuticals Inc. 545_F.3d_1312_(Fed.Cir.2008) stands for the proposition that a prior_art_reference is not anticipatory if one of ordinary_skill in the art would be required to pick items from two lists of components in order to assemble the invention
The issue in Impax was whether the use of the drug riluzole for treating amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( `` ALS '' ) was anticipated by *1362 U.S._Patent_No._5236,940 ( `` the ¡¬940_patent `` )
Id.at 1314
The ¡¬940_patent disclosed a formula that encompassed `` hundreds or thousands of compounds ''
Id.at 1315
The ¡¬940_patent also listed a number of diseases including ALS that could potentially be treated with compounds of the disclosed formula
Id
While we affirmed the district_court 's finding that undue_experimentation would have been required to practice the patent at issue in Impax there are important distinctions between that case and this one
Unlike the prior_art_reference at issue in Impax where there was no disclosed dosage information for using riluzole to treat ALS see id. Shahidi discloses component amounts within the ranges claimed in claim 34
Even more importantly Shahidi specifically discloses the use of both WS-23 and menthol in chewing_gum whereas the only mention of riluzole in the prior_art_reference in Impax was to disclaim it from the disclosed invention
See id
( `` the ¡¬940_patent.. specifically excludes riluzole from the invention '' )

Given the objective of the ¡¬233_patent to obtain `` a cooling flavor composition that will contribute a long-lasting cooling sensation '' and a chewing_gum with a `` clean high-quality flavor.. with a good cooling effect '' the Shahidi reference clearly identifies the combination of WS-23 which Shahidi identifies as one of three `` particularly preferred '' cooling agents and menthol which Shahidi identifies as being among the `` most suitable '' flavoring ingredients.4 The district_court therefore correctly held that Shahidi anticipates claim 34 of the ¡¬233_patent
