DAWN EQUIPMENT COMPANY Plaintiff-Appellee v. KENTUCKY FARMS INCORPORATED Defendant-Appellant
No._97-1042
| March_24,_1998
Synopsis
Patentee brought action alleging infringement of patent on device for adjusting height of farm_implements
The United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois Philip G. Reinhard J. entered judgment upon jury verdict for patentee finding infringement under doctrine of equivalents and denied defendant 's motion for judgment as matter of law
Defendant appealed
The Court of Appeals Plager Circuit_Judge held that accused device which had multiple-hole pinned height-adjustment mechanism did not infringe under doctrine of equivalents patent 's locking and releasing means with structure that included rotatable shaft pin and slot

Opinion for the court filed by Circuit_Judge PLAGER
Additional views filed by Circuit_Judges PLAGER NEWMAN and MICHEL
PLAGER Circuit_Judge
In this patent infringement case the jury determined that the accused device although not literally infringing infringed under the doctrine of equivalents
The trial_judge gave judgment accordingly and denied defendant 's motion for judgment as a matter of law ( `` JMOL '' )
Because on these facts no reasonable jury could have found infringement we reverse the denial of defendant 's motion for JMOL and order judgment for the defendant

BACKGROUND
Plaintiff Dawn Equipment Company ( `` Dawn Equipment '' ) sued defendant Kentucky_Farms Incorporated ( `` Kentucky_Farms '' ) for infringement of U.S. Patent No._5129,282 ( `` '282_patent `` ) entitled `` Mechanism for Selectively Repositioning a Farm Implement ''
Shortly before holding a jury trial the trial_judge held a Markman v. Westview Instruments Inc. 52_F.3d_967 975-76 34_USPQ2d_1321 1325-26 ( Fed.Cir.1995 ) hearing to construe the only asserted patent claim
The trial_judge instructed the jury on his claim construction and thereafter submitted the issues of literal_infringement and infringement under the doctrine of equivalents to the jury
The issues were submitted by way of two special interrogatories that asked the jury to answer with a simple yes or no whether there was literal_infringement and whether there was infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
The jury returned its verdict answering `` no '' to literal_infringement and `` yes '' to infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
Kentucky_Farms filed a motion for JMOL on the doctrine of equivalents infringement verdict
The trial_judge denied the motion and this appeal followed

The '282_patent discloses a device for adjusting the height of a farm_implement such as a row cleaning device
A row cleaning device which frequently consists of a pair of wheels having sharp teeth is often attached to a planter to clear residue from the planter 's path
In pointing out problems in the prior_art the '282_patent describes prior_art `` multi-hole pinned height adjustment '' mechanisms
'282_patent col._1,_l._55 to col._2,_l._29
The patent explains that raising or lowering such prior_art mechanisms can be very time-consuming tedious and repetitive
Adjusting the height of such mechanisms requires the operator to manually elevate and shift the farm_implement to align holes and insert pins
The patent also explains that the loose pins used in the prior_art mechanisms are easily lost
Moreover when adjusting the height of such a prior_art mechanism the operator is required to place himself beneath the farm_implement which increases the risk of accidents and injuries

The '282_patent explains that these problems are avoided by using an improved mechanism illustrated in Figures 1_and_2 of the patent reproduced below

*1011. ?
-- -- - Figure 1 shows the height adjusting mechanism in the lowered position ; Figure 2 shows the same device in the raised position
The device includes a control/locking_means 46 for alternating the implement between the raised and lowered positions
The control/locking_means includes a handle 48 cylindrical rods 50_and_56 a cylindrical_shaft 52 and a transverse pin 54 carried on the cylindrical_shaft 52
A spring 68 biases the mechanism in the raised position as shown in Figure 2
In the lowered position the pin 54 is engaged in the slot 72 against the bias of the spring 68
To move the implement from the lowered position to the raised position the operator presses down on and turns the handle 48 to rotate the pin 54 out of the slot 72
The spring 68 then overcomes the weight of the farm_implement and pushes the implement into the raised position
The patent explains that this operation can be performed safely and quickly from above the farm_implement

Claim 9 of the patent the only claim at issue provides ( emphasis added ) : *1012 A mechanism for adjusting the height of a farm_implement/tool of the type to be carried by a drawing_vehicle said adjusting mechanism comprising : a connecting_means for supporting a farm_implement/tool in an operative position ; means for guiding sliding movement of the connecting_means selectively between first and second_positions corresponding to raised and lowered positions for a farm_implement/tool carried by the connecting_means ; means for mounting the guiding means to one of a drawing_vehicle and a support to be carried by a drawing_vehicle ; means for locking the connecting_means in one of the first and second_positions and for selectively releasing the connecting_means to allow the connecting_means to be slid into the other of the first and second_positions_therefor ; means for limiting sliding movement of the connecting_means with the connecting_means released ; and
means for normally spring biasing the connecting_means to one of the first and second_positions_therefor

The accused Kentucky_Farms device illustrated below includes a connecting bar 10 which telescopes within a rectangular sleeve 12
