Opinion
Taranto Circuit_Judge
Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc. owns U.S. Patent No._8399,445 which describes and claims acetylcysteine compositions substantially free of chelating agents
It is listed in the Food and Drug Administration 's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations ( the Orange Book ) as covering Cumberland 's chelating-agent-free formulation of AcetadoteTHE_R an intravenous antidote for overdoses of acetaminophen
When Mylan_Institutional_LLC filed an abbreviated new drug application to market its own chelating-agent-free acetylcysteine formulation *1215 Cumberland brought this patent-infringement_action in the Northern_District of Illinois against Mylan_Institutional_LLC and Mylan_Inc. ( hereafter `` Mylan '' individually or jointly )
Mylan stipulated to infringement but asserted invalidity on two grounds : derivation of the claimed invention from someone at the FDA and obviousness
The district_court rejected both challenges after a bench_trial
In particular the court found that Mylan proved neither ( 1 ) that anyone at the FDA conceived of the claimed invention before the patent-named inventor nor ( 2 ) that there was a reasonable expectation that the claimed formulations without any chelating agents would succeed
Cumberland Pharm. Inc. v. Mylan_Institutional_LLC 137_F.Supp.3d_1108 1121-22 1127 ( N.D. Ill. 2015 )
We affirm

I
A
At the priority date relevant here ( August 24 2005 ) acetylcysteine was known in the art as an antidote for acetaminophen_overdoses
'445_patent col. 1 lines 20-34
It also was known to have a stability_problem : heavy_metal_ions whether inherent in the formulation or found as contaminants catalyze the oxidation of acetylcysteine in solution causing it to degrade
Id. col. 1 lines 39-40 ; see Cumberland 137 F.Supp.3d at 1112 n.2
A prior-art response to the stability_problem was to include edetate disodium ( EDTA or edetate ) in an acetylcysteine formulation
'445_patent col. 1 line 45 through col. 2 line 4
EDTA a chelating agent surrounds and binds to heavy_metal_ions preventing them from acting as catalysts that oxidize acetylcysteine
Id
Such EDTA-containing formulations of acetylcysteine were considered safe despite potential negative side effects
Id. col. 2 lines 14-27

Cumberland 's '445_patent declares : `` It has been surprisingly found that an aqueous composition containing acetylcysteine sterilized water and a pH-adjusting agent is stable without the addition of a chelating agent ''
Id. col. 2 lines 48-50
The patent claims such compositions
Every claim in the patent requires a `` stable '' composition that is `` free of chelating agents '' id. col. 9 line 16 through col. 10 line 53 and the district_court construed the term to mean `` [ l ] acking one or more chelating agents '' Cumberland 137 F.Supp.3d at 1112
