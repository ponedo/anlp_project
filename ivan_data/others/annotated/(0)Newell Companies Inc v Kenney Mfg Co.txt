NIES Circuit_Judge
Newell Companies Inc. appeals from the judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the District of Rhode_Island 606_F.Supp._1282 226_USPQ_157_(D.R.I.1985) ( Boyle C.J
) in a patent infringement suit brought against Kenney Manufacturing Company
Following a jury trial in which the jury answered interrogatories responding inter alia that no claims in issue of United States Patent No._4006,770 ( the '770_patent ) owned by Newell were proved invalid for obviousness under the standard of 35 U.S.C.¡± 103 ( 1982 ) the district_court granted Kenney 's reserved motion for directed verdict and entered judgment for Kenney on that issue holding claims 1 2 6_and_7 invalid
We affirm

I
Background
The invention of the '770_patent relates to retractable ( up and down ) window shades
Ferguson the inventor was products manager of Newell 's window shade division and developed the shade after seeing certain vinyl shade_material manufactured by Sean Corcoran
Corcoran 's material is scored partially through in lines parallel to one lengthwise edge so that it can be torn to a desired width
Its advantage over other scored shade_materials is that light does not shine through the scored portion

Corcoran sought a patent which claimed his shade_material in combination with a roller and in In re Corcoran 640_F.2d_1331 208_USPQ_867_(CCPA_1981) a predecessor of this court addressed the patentability of Corcoran 's invention
Because the Corcoran_material had been placed on sale in the United States in 1972 more than a year before the filing date of Corcoran 's application and the combination with a roller would have been obvious Corcoran was held to have lost his right to a patent under 35 U.S.C.¡± 102 ( b ) /¡± 103 ( 1982 )
Specifically the court stated : As to the support means we conclude that given the plastic sheet shade_material denominated a `` window shade '' nothing could be more obvious than to attach it to a roller or other support
Id.at 1334 208 USPQ at 870
The Corcoran_material alone or in combination with a roller thus was unprotectable and freely available for anyone to use

After learning of the Corcoran_material in late 1973 or early 1974 Ferguson sensing the market potential contacted Corcoran who resided in Ireland and requested sample shades
Corcoran sent the shades along with a letter explaining that he would not have the output to supply Newell until 1975 and that at the time rollers were in better supply and cheaper in America
This correspondence led to meetings and eventually to a business arrangement between Corcoran and Newell
Ferguson proceeded to develop the subject matter of the '770_patent which attaches the Corcoran_material to a telescoping roller having a smaller section able to slide inside a larger section

Ferguson claims the advantage that his shade can be assembled by consumers without the use of tools
As explained in *760 the specification the material is affixed to the larger_roller_section
After adjusting the width of the material and roller the consumer removes a protective cover on an adhesive strip on the smaller roller end and presses the material onto that adhesive
In conducting test marketing Newell made shades from material supplied by Corcoran and from telescoping rollers available on the market and made by Clopay Corporation
As described infra the Clopay_roller came with a cardboard sleeve which fitted over its smaller telescoping end
That sleeve was unnecessary in the Ferguson assembly and was simply discarded
The Clopay_roller is the subject of United States Patent No._3203,468 ( the '468_patent ) issued to Gossling and owned by Clopay

Shortly thereafter Ferguson applied for the patent which is the subject of this suit
Claim 1 of the '770_patent which issued to Ferguson in February 1977 reads : In an extensible and retractable roll window_shade_assembly which is width adjustable and installable by the consumer without the use of tools or cutting elements the combination of a telescoping roller_assembly said telescoping roller_assembly including a first_roller_section said first_roller_section having a constant external diameter from end_portion to end_portion the outer_end_portion of said first_roller_section having first means for supporting the window_shade_assembly from a first support location the inner end_portion of said first_roller_section having an opening therein of a size to receive a second_roller_section said second_roller_section having a constant nominal external diameter from end_portion to end_portion the outer_end_portion of said second_roller_section having second means for supporting the window_shade_assembly from a second support location said second_roller_section being telescopically slidably received within the first_roller_section whereby the length of the roller_assembly can be adjustable within the limits of the range of telescoping movement means for precluding relative rotation between the first and second_roller_sections a shade of flexible sheet material a first portion of the upper_end of the shade being secured to the first_roller_section one side portion of the shade having a plurality of lines of weakness which extend from the upper_end of the shade to the lower end of the shade whereby the width of the shade can be adjusted to a desired width by separating a portion of the side of the shade from the balance of the shade said separated portion being bounded on the outside by the original shade edge and on the inside by a line of weakness along which said portion is separated from the balance of the shade said first and second telescoping roller sections being adjustable to an overall length which is at least as wide as the length of the final shade width without severance of any portion of either section securement means for securing the second portion of the upper_end of the shade which is generally aligned with the second_roller_section in fixed relationship to the second smaller external diameter roller section with a substantially constant securing force from point to point along the length of the portion of the second_roller_section which extends beyond the end of the first_roller_section whereby the positions of the first and second_roller_sections are fixed with respect to one another and to the shade throughout the entire area of overlap of the shade and the roller_assembly

The Newell window shade was successful with consumers immediately on its introduction into full marketing in October 1975
Other shade companies introduced competing products
In July 1981 Kenney 's do-it-yourself shade appeared in response to the requirements of its customer K-Mart
The Kenney_shade was made with scored material and a telescoping roller but unlike Ferguson 's design the shade_material was attached to the larger_roller_section only and was simply allowed to wrap loosely around the smaller end

At trial Kenney asserted numerous defenses but the dispositive issue here is whether the '770 invention would have been obvious from prior art which includes *761 the Corcoran_material telescoping rollers and various means for securing a shade to a roller including adhesive strips and partial securement as in the Kenney_shade
At the conclusion of presentation of evidence both parties moved for a directed verdict on which the district_court reserved its rulings and the case was submitted to the jury
In its instructions the court directed the jury to answer a series of questions including a question whether any of the claims of Newell 's '770_patent would have been obvious to which the jury answered `` No '' and whether Kenney infringed any claims to which the jury answered `` Yes ''
After receipt of the jury 's verdict in this form the court made its rulings on the parties ' motions for directed verdict denying Newell 's and granting Kenney's.1 The district_court set out in detail a set of facts and explained the basis for its decision holding claims 1 2 6 and 7 unpatentable under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103 that is the court concluded from this set of facts that the invention would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art.2 The court also held that the jury 's verdict was not reasonable
Newell appeals the grant of judgment for Kenney

After entry of judgment Kenney moved for attorney fees
The court denied that motion and Kenney cross-appeals the denial of attorney fees.3
