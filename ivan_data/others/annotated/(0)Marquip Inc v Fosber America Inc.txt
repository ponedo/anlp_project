Synopsis
Patentee brought action alleging infringement of patent that claimed improvements for handling and stacking of corrugated_paperboard_sheets
The United_States_District_Court for the Western_District of Wisconsin John C. Shabaz Chief Judge granted summary_judgment for alleged infringer and 30_F.Supp.2d_1142 denied patentee 's motion for relief from judgment
Patentee appealed both orders and appeals were consolidated

Opinion
RADER Circuit_Judge
On summary_judgment the United_States_District_Court for the Western_District of Wisconsin ruled that defendants Fosber_America Inc. Fosber_SpA and United_Container_Machinery Inc. did not infringe U.S._Patent_No._4200,276 ( the '276_patent ) under the doctrine of equivalents
See Marquip Inc. v. Fosber_America Inc. No._96-_C-726-S ( W.D.Wis
Sept.14 1998 ) ( order )
The district_court also denied Marquip Inc. 's motion for relief under Fed.R.Civ.P
60 ( b )
See Marquip Inc. v. Fosber_America Inc. 30_F.Supp.2d_1142 ( W.D.Wis
1998 ) ( order )
Because the district_court properly concluded as a matter of law that the claims at issue can not cover the accused device under the doctrine of equivalents this court affirms
This court also affirms the district_court 's denial of the Rule 60 ( b ) motion because the district_court did not abuse its discretion

I
The '276_patent claims a method and device for shingling and stacking corrugated_paperboard_sheets without interrupting the continuous flow of sheets
Because the corrugator runs continuously it is difficult to remove completed stacks of sheets without interrupting the flow of the corrugator
The invention solves this problem by creating a gap in the flow of sheets
The gap allows sufficient time to discharge a completed stack without interrupting the corrugator
Claims 9_and_13 the only two claims at issue recite a method and a device respectively for automatically *1365 changing the speed of the conveyor belts to create a gap : 9
In the method of conveying sheets in succession from a first_location along a plurality of separate in-line_conveyors to a stacker wherein a vertical_stack of a predetermined_number of sheets is to be formed and wherein said plurality of conveyors are traveling at the same_speed the steps of : ( a ) shingling said sheets as they pass said location to form a group of shingled sheets for stacking ( b ) increasing the speed of said group of shingled sheets ( c ) and slowing each said separate in-line_conveyor individually and seccessively [ sic ] in a downstream_direction in response to passage of the trailing end of said group past the end of each respective_separate_conveyor to thereby slow sheets traveling upstream of said group of sheets

In a device for conveying sheets in succession from a first_location along a plurality of separate in-line_conveyors to a stacker wherein a vertical_stack of a predetermined_number of sheets is to be formed and wherein said plurality of conveyors are traveling at the same_speed the combination comprising : ( a ) means for shingling said sheets as they pass said location to form a group of shingled sheets for stacking ( b ) means for increasing the speed of said group of shingled sheets ( c ) and means for slowing each said separate in-line_conveyor individually and successively in a downstream_direction in response to passage of the trailing end of said group past the end of each respective_separate_conveyor to thereby slow sheets traveling upstream of said group of sheets
'276_patent col._7,_ll._22-39 ; col._8,_ll._31-47 ( emphasis added )

Marquip asserts that versions 1 2 3 and 4 of the Fosber_device infringe claims 9_and_13 of the '276_patent
Both parties rely on a stipulated description of the process in the accused Fosber_devices
Version 2 is the most basic of the Fosber_devices
In Version 2 a `` shingling nip '' continuously shingles or overlaps sheets onto a moving conveyor
The first_conveyor moves the shingled sheets to a second_conveyor which moves at the same_speed as the first
The Fosber_device has an interrupt_mechanism between the first and second_conveyors
This mechanism grasps and holds some sheets to create a gap in the flow of sheets
Specifically when the trailing end of the last sheet in a predetermined_number of sheets ( the preceding group ) moves past the pinch point of the interrupt_mechanism the mechanism grabs and stops the next sheet
This action creates a gap and starts the next_group of a predetermined_number of sheets ( the succeeding group )

At about the same time the interrupter grasps the first sheet in the next_group two other events also occur : ( 1 ) the second_conveyor and all other conveyors downstream of the interrupt_mechanism speed up carrying the preceding group toward a stacker at the end of the conveyors and ( 2 ) the first_conveyor slows down
When the preceding group leaves the third_conveyor the second_conveyor slows again to the pace of the first_conveyor and the interrupt_mechanism releases the succeeding group
Similarly the third_conveyor slows when the preceding group passes the fourth_conveyor
The fourth_conveyor slows when the preceding group is on a downstacker at the end of the conveyors
The downstacker discharges the preceding group from the stacker and makes room for a new stack

Fosber 's Version 1 differs from Version 2 only in the location of the interrupt_mechanism-namely midway along the second_conveyor
When the interrupt_mechanism closes the interrupt_mechanism itself moves at the same_speed as the first_conveyor
In Version 1 the second_conveyor operates exactly the same as in Version 2 namely speeding up to widen *1366 the gap
Version 3 is the same as Version 1 except that two conveyors replace the first_conveyor but they always run at the same_speed
Version 4 is the same as Version 2 except that again two conveyors replace the first_conveyor and always run at the same_speed
For purposes of this opinion it suffices to discuss Version 2 as representative of all Fosber_devices which contain an interrupt_mechanism and conveyors with varying speeds

At the initial trial the district_court considered two of Marquip 's patents the '276_patent and U.S._Patent_No._4273,325
The district_court granted summary_judgment that Fosber did not infringe the two patents either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents
See Marquip Inc. v. Fosber_America Inc. No._96-_C-726-S ( W.D.Wis
June_10,_1997 ) ( order ) ( Marquip I )
When Marquip appealed Marquip I this court affirmed the district_court 's grant of summary_judgment that Fosber did not literally infringe the '276_patent but vacated the summary_judgment of non-infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
See Marquip Inc. v. Fosber_America Inc. 155_F.3d_567 1998_WL_314628 No._97-1441 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) ( Marquip II )
As part of the ruling this court construed the limitation `` group '' as an accumulation of a predetermined_number of sheets
On remand the district_court again granted summary_judgment of non-infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
See Marquip Inc. v. Fosber_America Inc. No._96-_C-726-S ( W.D.Wis
Sept.14 1998 ) ( order ) ( Marquip_III )

The critical issue in Marquip_III was whether element ( c ) of claims 9_and_13 covered the Fosber_device
The district_court concluded that the Fosber_device performs the recited function of slowing the conveyors and obtains the result of decreasing the speed of the sheets traveling upstream
See id.at 10
The district_court determined however that the Fosber_device performs the function `` in a fundamentally different_way ''
Id
In particular the district_court held that `` [ t ] he presence of a functional interrupt_mechanism [ in the Fosber_device ] not the minimal change in timing required by its presence is that which makes defendants ' machines operate in a substantially different_way '' from the claimed inventions
Id.at 13
Marquip appeals

In a separate appeal Marquip appeals the district_court 's refusal to set aside final judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P
60 ( b )
See Marquip Inc. v. Fosber_America Inc. No._96-_C-726-S ( W.D.Wis
Dec.8 1998 ) ( order ) ( Marquip IV )
Marquip based its motion on newly discovered evidence about the Fosber_device allegedly withheld by Fosber during discovery
This court consolidates the two appeals and addresses both the infringement and Rule 60 ( b ) issues in this opinion
