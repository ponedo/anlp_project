Nos._99-1561 99-1583
| Decided Feb._13,_2001
Synopsis
Patentee brought suit against competitor alleging that its patent for high-performance double-walled aluminum softball_bat had been infringed
On cross-motions for summary_judgment the United_States_District_Court for the District of Oregon Garr M. King J. 1999_WL_571074 granted summary_judgment to competitor
Patentee appealed
The Court of Appeals Linn Circuit_Judge held that : ( 1 ) term `` frame '' as modified by term `` bat '' and used in patent was a tubular structure having a large-diameter_impact_portion a tapered_portion and a small-diameter handle all of which are connected when the bat is fully constructed ; ( 2 ) claim describing an internal structural insert inside large-diameter_impact_portion required that impact_portion be part of bat_frame ; ( 3 ) `` insert '' as used in patent meant a piece of material that was separate from and completely surrounded by frame ; and ( 4 ) competitor 's bat which featured an external_shell over hitting_end did not infringe patent literally or under doctrine of equivalents

DeMarini_Sports Inc. ( `` DeMarini '' ) appeals from the decision of the United_States_District_Court for the District of Oregon granting the motion of Worth Inc. ( `` Worth '' ) for summary_judgment ( `` SJ '' ) of non-infringement of DeMarini 's U.S. Patent No._5415,398 ( `` the ¡¬398_patent `` ) and denying the motion of DeMarini for summary_judgment of infringement of claim 15 of the ¡¬ 398 patent literally and of claims 1 2 15 and 18 of the ¡¬398_patent under the doctrine of equivalents

We hold that the district_court 's construction of the terms `` frame '' and `` insert '' *1318 was not erroneous
We also hold that the district_court 's construction of claim 15 to require that the large-diameter_impact_portion be part of a bat_frame was not erroneous
Moreover we conclude that no reasonable jury could find infringement either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents of claims 1 2 15 or 18 of DeMarini 's ¡¬398_patent
Thus we affirm the district_court 's judgment of no infringement

BACKGROUND
The technology of the ¡¬398_patent is high-performance double-walled aluminum softball_bats
In or around 1989 Ray DeMarini approached Michael Eggiman the inventor of the ¡¬398_patent and proposed that they form a part-time business designing and selling high-performance softball_bats
Prior to embarking on this project Eggiman knew nothing about bat design
His expertise was in the design of leaf_springs for trucks and was gained at the suspension division of a truck manufacturing company where he worked as a full-time mechanical engineer with DeMarini

Eggiman began his bat design efforts by studying commercially available bats
From his study Eggiman concluded that one of the most important factors in bat performance was the thickness of the wall of the bat at the point of impact with a ball i.e. the impact_portion of the bat
Eggiman noted that although thicker-walled_bats resisted denting and lasted longer thinner-walled_bats had better performance due to the ability of the wall of the bat to cave in and spring back-an effect commonly referred to as the `` trampoline_effect ''
Eggiman 's new understanding of the importance of the trampoline_effect coupled with his knowledge of the manner in which leaf_springs are able to give and slide over one another gave him the idea of a double-walled_bat i.e. a bat in which there are two concentric tubes at least at the hitting_end of the bat

Eggiman considered two approaches to the design of a double-walled_bat
The first approach was to insert one tube inside a traditional bat of the type having a relatively large_diameter_impact_portion at one end and tapering to a relatively small diameter handle portion at the other end
The second_approach was to take the traditional bat structure and position a larger diameter tube ; i.e. an exterior_shell over the impact_portion of the bat
However in reducing his design to practice Eggiman did not pursue the second_approach because he did not know if such a construction would be safe
More particularly he was not sure how to keep the exterior_shell securely attached over the end of the bat

The ¡¬398_patent application was filed on May_14,_1993 and finally issued on May_16,_1995
Figures 1 2 and 3 of the ¡¬398_patent are shown below depicting a described embodiment of the invention

A bat designed according to the claims of the ¡¬398_patent was marketed in 1993
The claims at issue of the ¡¬398_patent read as follows : 1
A bat comprising : a hollow_tubular_bat_frame having a circular cross-section ; and
an insert positioned within the frame the insert having a circular cross-section the insert having first and second_ends adjoining the tubular_frame the insert being separated from the tubular_frame by a gap forming at least part of an annular shape along a central portion between said first and second_ends the frame elastically deflectable across the gap to operably engage the insert along a portion of the insert between the insert first and second_ends
2
A bat according to claim 1 in which the insert is suspended within the frame and is secured thereto at said first and second_ends
15
In a hollow bat having a small-diameter handle portion and a large-diameter_impact_portion an improvement comprising an internal structural *1320 insert defining an annular_gap with an inside wall of the impact_portion of the bat and the impact_portion elastically deflectable to close a portion of the annular_gap and operably engage the insert
18
A bat comprising : a hollow_tubular_bat_frame having a small-diameter handle portion and a large-diameter_impact_portion having a circular cross-section with an inner and outer_diameter ; at least one insert having a substantially circular cross-section with an outer_diameter less than the inner diameter of the frame impact_portion the insert being held within the impact_portion ; and
the impact_portion being inwardly elastically deflectable such to establish a tight interference_fit between the insert and the impact_portion

The Worth bat accused of infringing the foregoing claims of the ¡¬398_patent is a softball_bat known as the `` EST '' bat
Instead of an insert disposed within the impact_portion of the bat Worth places an external_shell over the hitting_end of the bat
Three of Worth 's engineering drawings of the EST_bat are shown below

?
During the design of the EST_bat Worth tested a commercial version of DeMarini 's patented bat but was not aware of the existence of the ¡¬398_patent at that time
Worth admits though that it learned about the ¡¬398_patent prior to completing its design of the EST_bat
Additionally in 1996 Worth and DeMarini engaged in licensing negotiations over the ¡¬398_patent but Worth was unable to obtain a license

Despite the fact that Worth knew of the ¡¬398_patent before finishing the EST_bat_design Worth contends that its EST_bat_design is based on independent design concepts substantially different from those of the ¡¬398 bat
According to Worth design efforts for the EST_bat began prior to the *1321 issuance of the ¡¬398_patent
These efforts included research and development work done by a consultant for Worth Dr. Speckhart during the development of the Worth SUPERCELL 2 bat introduced commercially in 1995
During his work on the SUPERCELL 2 project Speckhart discovered that when a ball was hit with the large_diameter_impact_portion of a conventional bat the resulting bending of the tapered_portion of the bat had a significant positive effect on hitting performance
Worth refers to this bending phenomenon as the `` diving_board_effect ''
From this discovery Worth designed the SUPERCELL 2 bat focusing on the shape and thickness of the tapered_portion of the bat

Worth contends that in designing the EST_bat it was primarily concerned with maximizing the diving_board_effect it had begun to develop in the SUPERCELL 2 bats
To achieve the maximum benefit of the diving_board_effect Worth 's focus was on reducing the starting diameter of the tapered_section of the EST_bat
Worth knew that to be a successful bat however the EST would also have to provide the maximum_diameter_impact_portion allowed by softball_rules ; i.e. 2.25 inches
According to Worth with the foregoing concepts in mind the EST_bat was designed to have a hollow_body that is tapered down to a handle at one end and is covered at the opposite `` hitting_end '' by an exterior_shell

Worth specifically asserts that the diameter of the hollow_body of the EST_bat was designed to be less than the maximum_diameter permitted for an impact_portion of a softball_bat so that the beginning of the tapered_section could be as small as possible to provide for the greatest amount of bat_bending
To accommodate this design and build the diameter of the impact_portion back up to the maximum_diameter allowed under the softball_rules the exterior_shell was added at the hitting_end
According to Worth the EST exterior_shell over the hitting_end both increases the diameter and reinforces the bat in the area where it is intended to impact a ball
Because the diameter of the EST body where it is tapered is smaller than in conventional aluminum bats bat_bending is increased which Worth believes increases the EST 's slugging power

DeMarini filed its infringement suit against Worth in the United_States_District_Court for the District of Oregon ( `` the district_court '' ) on November 28 1997 alleging that Worth 's EST_bat infringed claims 1 2 15 and 18 of DeMarini 's ¡¬398_patent under the doctrine of equivalents
After DeMarini filed a motion for summary_judgment of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents and Worth filed a reply thereto the district_court conducted a Markman_hearing
DeMarini_Sports Inc. v. Worth Inc. No._97-1693-_KI slip op.at 2 ( U.S.Dist.Ct.Or
Jan._14,_1999 ) ( `` DeMarini I '' )
In a January 14 1999 opinion the district_court set forth its construction of the only claim terms then in dispute namely `` gap '' as used in claims 1_and_15 and `` interference_fit '' as used in claim 18
Id.at 4-9

Following DeMarini I Worth filed a motion for summary_judgment of non-infringement of claims 1 2 15 and 18
DeMarini renewed its previous summary_judgment_motion and added a contention that the EST_bat also literally infringed claim 15
The district_court ruled on these motions in DeMarini_II

The district_court found that Worth failed to satisfy its burden of proof that claim 18 was invalid for indefiniteness and thus denied that summary_judgment_motion
DeMarini_II slip op.at 5
In addressing the motions regarding infringement the district_court noted sua sponte that it needed to construe the term `` large-diameter_impact_portion '' as used in claim 15 which term was not in issue at the time of the Markman_hearing
After construing *1322 this term the district_court concluded that the Worth EST_bat neither infringed claim 15 literally nor infringed claims 1 2 15 and 18 under the doctrine of equivalents
Id.at 6-14
The district_court then granted Worth 's summary_judgment_motion of non-infringement and denied DeMarini 's summary_judgment_motion of infringement
Id.at 14

DeMarini timely appealed the judgment regarding infringement and Worth cross-appealed the district_court 's construction of the claim terms `` gap '' and `` interference_fit ''
We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( 1994 )
