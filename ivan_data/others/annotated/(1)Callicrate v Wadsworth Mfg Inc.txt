Before NEWMAN RADER and PROST Circuit_Judges
Opinion
RADER Circuit_Judge
Callicrate is the owner of several patents on methods and apparatuses for castrating large animals ( like cattle ) including U.S._Patent_No._5236,434 ( the '434_patent ) ; U.S._Patent_No._5997,553 ( the '553_patent ) ; and U.S._Patent_No._5681,329 ( the '329_patent )
Callicrate initiated suit against Wadsworth Manufacturing Inc. ( Wadsworth ) on two of these patents in the United_States_District_Court for the District of Montana asserting that Wadsworth 's EZE_No._2 and No._3_castration_tools ( or use thereof ) infringed claims 7 11 18 19 22 25 27 and 30 of the '329_patent and claims 11-13 16 and 18 of the '553_patent
After a jury trial on the merits the jury found all of the asserted claims anticipated obvious and not infringed
The district_court denied Callicrate 's Judgment as a Matter of Law ( JMOL ) motions on infringement and validity
Callicrate v. Wadsworth Mfg. CV 00-185-M-DWM ( D.Mont
Aug._5,_2004 ) ( Post Trial Order )
Because the district_court improperly found that the '553 and '329_patent s were not entitled to priority back to the '434_patent this court reverses the jury_verdict of anticipation and obviousness over an intervening patent
Because substantial evidence does not support the jury_verdict of no infringement this court also reverses that verdict and remands for a trial on damages

I. Wadsworth and Callicrate are competitors in the manufacture and sale of castration tools
These tools operate by tensively securing ligature_material around an animal 's scrotum thereby preventing blood from flowing to the testicles
With time the ligated testicles atrophy and fall from the animal
Wadsworth introduced its first `` EZE '' castration tool the EZE_No._1 in 1986
The EZE_No._1 is described in U.S. Patent No._4691,704 ( the '704_patent )
Figure 1 depicts an embodiment of this invention :

?
*1364 The EZE_No._1 can be characterized as a `` caulking_gun-type '' device because its trigger mechanism moves tightening rod 46 in a manner similar to a caulking_gun
See '704_patent col._5,_ll._13-17
This caulking_gun-type_tightening_mechanism also appears in the EZE_No._2 and EZE No._3 devices the accused products in this case

After Wadsworth began selling the EZE_No._1 Callicrate identified a number of problems with the device and developed the improved device disclosed in Callicrate 's '434_patent
For instance Callicrate faulted the `` caulking_gun-type '' tightening mechanism
As explained in the '434_patent : [ T ] he process of tightening the loop through successive pulls on the trigger mechanism [ as disclosed in the '704_patent ] is time consuming and the animal must therefore be restrained for a longer period of time
In addition the tension which can be imparted to the band and the tightness of the loop are limited by the hand strength of the user
Moreover relatively large frictional and abrasive forces are exerted on the band where the band is attached to the tightening rod thereby increasing the likelihood of damage to the elastomeric material causing breakage before the desired tension is achieved
Additionally due to the design of the ligature tool an operator is limited in the extent a band can be tightened
Once an operator has fully retracted the tightening rod the loop 's tightness can not be increased
'434_patent col._1,_l._62- col._2,_l._9
To overcome these problems Callicrate invented a winding_assembly 14 that performs essentially the same function as Wadsworth 's caulking_gun-type_tightening_mechanism but in a different manner
See '434_patent col._3,_ll._66-68
Figure 1 shows an embodiment of this invention :

?
The winding_assembly 14 is the only tightening / pulling mechanism claimed in the '434_patent
Presumably Callicrate did not assert the '434_patent against Wadsworth 's EZE line of products because they do not include such an assembly

Unlike the '434_patent however Callicrate 's later '553 and '329_patent s claim tools with a `` means for pulling '' that encompasses both caulking_gun-type_tightening_mechanisms as well as winding_assembly mechanisms
Callicrate v. Wadsworth Mfg. 217_F.Supp.2d_1101 1109 ( D.Mont.2002 ) ( Claim Construction Order ) ( noting that Wadsworth conceded the claimed `` pulling means '' covers a winding spool mechanism and a caulking_gun-type mechanism )
Claims 11 14_and_16 of the '553_patent are representative : 11
A tool for ligating a body part comprising : an elongated tool_body having a forward end and a rearward_end said rearward_end having a handle and said forward *1365 end having a means for receiving elastomeric ligature_material ; means for pulling said ligature_material towards said rearward_end of said tool_body said means for pulling interconnected to said tool_body ; and
a lever pivotally mounted on said tool_body for deforming a grommet positioned in said means for receiving
... 14
The tool of claim 11 wherein said means for pulling comprises a means for winding ligature_material said winding_means adjustable to regulate the amount of force communicated by the rotation of said winding_means to regulate the tension of said ligature_material
... 16
The tool as set forth in claim 11 wherein said means for pulling comprises a caulking_gun-type device
'553_patent col._24,_ll._11-21 28-32 38-39 ( emphases added )
Faced with this broader claim language in the '553 and '329_patent s Wadsworth admitted its EZE_No._2 and No._3_castration_tools ( or use thereof ) with their caulking_gun-type_tightening_mechanism satisfy every element of the asserted claims
Callicrate v. Wadsworth Mfg. CV-00-185-M-DWM slip op.at 6-8 ( D.Mont
Nov._20,_2003 ) ( Final Pre-Trial Order )

Despite this admission Wadsworth argued at trial that its EZE_No._2 and No._3_castration_tools do not infringe the asserted apparatus claims because their components are not connected in the particular manner recited in the claims
Wadsworth further argued that use of its EZE_No._2 and No._3_castration_tools does not infringe the asserted method claims because a user does not perform all of the claimed steps
The jury ultimately agreed with Wadsworth finding none of the asserted claims infringed by the sale or use of the EZE_No._2 or No._3_castration_tools

Wadsworth also argued that the '553 and '329_patent s are invalid as anticipated or obvious in view of Wadsworth 's U.S._Patent_No._5425,736 ( the '736_patent ) and the EZE_No._2 device disclosed therein
Wadsworth however filed the '736_patent after Callicrate 's '434_patent from which both the '329 and '553_patent s claim priority
Thus the '736_patent would not constitute prior_art against the '329 and '553_patent s if their claims of priority back to the '434_patent is valid
On their face these priority claims seem valid because the '329_patent is a continuation in part of U.S._Patent_No._5403,325 which is a continuation in part of the '434_patent
The '553_patent in turn is a divisional of U.S._Patent_No._5483,095 which is a continuation in part of the '329_patent

While admitting the relationship of the '553 and '329_patent s to the '434_patent Wadsworth argued that those patents are not entitled to priority back to the '434_patent because the '434_patent does not satisfy 35 U.S.C.¡± 112 ?
1 with respect to the caulking_gun-type_tightening_mechanism
The district_court agreed : Callicrate 's failure to include the caulking_gun_mechanism anywhere in the application for the '434_patent other than the Background section coupled with the disparaging nature of the remarks therein demonstrates that the '434_patent does not disclose the use of the caulking_gun
This conclusion is further supported by the limiting definition of the winding_means in claim 5 and the efforts to distinguish the caulking_gun_mechanism in the prosecution history
Though none of the cases cited by the parties is directly on point under the facts the case law supports a finding that the Callicrate '329 and '553_patent s can not claim priority from the filing date of the Callicrate '434_patent with respect to the caulking_gun_mechanism
The.. '736_patent is thus prior_art to *1366 the '329 and '553_patent s with respect to the caulking feature
Callicrate v. Wadsworth Mfg. CV 00-185-M-DWM slip op.at 13-14 ( D.Mont
Dec._3,_2003 ) ( Summary Judgment Order )
Based on this reasoning the district_court instructed the jury that the '736_patent is prior_art to the '553 and '329_patent s. The jury then found those patents anticipated by and obvious in view of the '736_patent
