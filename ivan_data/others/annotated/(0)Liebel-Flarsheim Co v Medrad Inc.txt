Opinion
LOURIE Circuit_Judge
Liebel-Flarsheim Company and Mallinckrodt Inc. ( collectively `` Liebel '' ) appeal from the decision of the United_States_District_Court for the Southern_District of Ohio granting Medrad 's motion for summary_judgment that four of Liebel 's patents are invalid under 35 U.S.C.¡±¡± 112_and_102
Liebel-Flarsheim_Co. v. Medrad Inc. No._01- CV-98-858 2005_WL_2840744_(S.D.Ohio_Oct._28,_2005)
Medrad_cross-appeals from the decision of the district_court granting Liebel 's motion for summary_judgment that Medrad infringed the asserted patents and that the inventorship_designation on Liebel 's patents is correct
Medrad also cross-appeals from the holding that the inequitable_conduct_counterclaim was moot in light of the district_court 's invalidity_rulings
Because we conclude that Liebel 's patents are invalid the front-loading_patents for lack of enablement and the syringe-sensing patents on anticipation we affirm the district_court 's judgment of invalidity
As a result the cross-appeals on infringement and inventorship need not be reached
We also affirm the court 's decision that the inequitable_conduct_counterclaim is presently moot

BACKGROUND
This is the second time this case has been on appeal in our court
The detailed facts of the case are presented in our previous opinion and we present here only those facts relevant to this appeal
See Liebel-Flarsheim_Co. v. Medrad Inc. 358_F.3d_898 ( Fed.Cir.2004 ) ( `` Liebel_I '' )
This appeal concerns asserted claims of four of Liebel 's patents : claims 10 11 13 and 16-19 of U.S._Patent 5,456,669 ; claims 1 8 9 11-13 15 16 18 22 27 28 30-33 and 34-37 of U.S._Patent 5,658,261 ; claims 7 8 10 and 11 of U.S._Patent 5,662,612 ; and claims 1 2 4 5 7 8 10 11 13 14 16 17 19 20 22 and 23 of U.S._Patent 5,928,197
The ¡¬669 and ¡¬261_patent s ( hereinafter the `` front-loading_patents '' ) share a common_specification and are directed to a front-loading fluid_injector with a replaceable syringe capable of withstanding high pressures for delivering a contrast agent to a patient
The ¡¬612 and ¡¬197_patent s ( hereinafter the `` syringe-sensing patents '' ) also share a common_specification and are directed to a computer-controlled injector wherein a motor advances and retracts a plunger located within the syringe

With regard to the asserted claims of the front-loading_patents this appeal challenges the district_court 's holding of invalidity following our prior claim_construction regarding a pressure_jacket
Claim 10 of the ¡¬669_patent is representative of the asserted claims of the front-loading_patents and reads as follows : A method of loading a tubular replacement syringe into a high pressure power injector for injecting fluid into an animal the method comprising the steps of : providing a power injector having : a syringe receiving opening with a generally circular periphery therein adapted to receive a rearward_end of a syringe having a generally circular_rim a ram and a motor linked to the ram and operable to reciprocate the ram *1374 along a segment of a line projecting through the opening ; and providing a hollow tubular syringe that includes : a cylindrical body having an axis a generally circular_rim a rearward_end and a closed forward end with a fluid discharge orifice therein and
a plunger axially slidable in the body the syringe body being structurally capable of withstanding at least from the rim to the orifice fluid at an operating pressure of at least 100 psi within the interior thereof ; then : inserting into the opening by generally rearward axial movement of the syringe the rearward_end of the body ; rotating the syringe in the opening a fraction of a turn to thereby lock the body around the rim to the injector around the periphery of the opening ; and
engaging the plunger with the ram ; then : energizing the motor and thereby driving the ram forward along the line and parallel to the axis to move the plunger axially forward at a programmed speed to inject the fluid at the operating pressure from within the syringe and through the orifice at a programmed rate into the animal
¡¬669_patent col. 15_ll._17 -50
The claims in the originally-filed application1 explicitly recited a pressure_jacket in front of the syringe receiving opening
During the prosecution of the front-loading_patents Liebel removed all references in the claims to a pressure_jacket
Medrad asserted and the district_court agreed that during the prosecution of the front-loading_patents the applicants became aware of Medrad 's jacketless_injector system and then deleted all references to a pressure_jacket in the asserted claims in order to encompass Medrad 's injector within the scope of the claims
The examiner allowed the claims and the claims as issued do not contain an explicit recitation of a pressure_jacket

Even though the claims do not expressly recite a pressure_jacket the district_court initially construed the asserted claims of the front-loading_patents as requiring a pressure_jacket
Based on that construction the district_court granted summary_judgment of noninfringement in favor of Medrad because Medrad 's accused devices do not contain a pressure_jacket

In the first appeal to this court we reversed the district_court 's claim_construction and determined that the asserted claims of the front-loading_patents do not require a pressure_jacket
We first considered the language of the claims and observed that neither claim 10 of the ¡¬669_patent nor any of the other asserted claims expressly mentions a pressure_jacket
We further rejected the district_court 's conclusion that the term `` opening '' in independent claim 10 of the ¡¬669_patent must be limited to an opening in a pressure_jacket
We then considered the specification and determined that although all the described embodiments include a pressure_jacket *1375 the disclosure did not clearly disavow embodiments lacking a pressure_jacket
We also observed that the prosecution_history indicates that the asserted claims purposefully did not include a pressure_jacket limitation in order to cover devices that lacked a pressure_jacket
In light of the intrinsic evidence we declined to limit the claims to require a pressure_jacket
Although Medrad argued that we should construe the claims narrowly to preserve their validity we declined to do so stating that the question of validity was a separate issue that could be addressed on remand
Liebel_I 383 F.3d at 912

On remand and in light of our claim_construction the district_court concluded that Medrad 's devices did infringe the asserted claims of the front-loading_patents but that those claims were invalid for lack of compliance with the written description and enablement_requirements of the statute
The district_court reasoned that the claims were invalid for lack of written description because the specification does not describe a jacketless_injector
The court noted that the written description of the invention is directed to the improvement of `` loading and unloading a syringe given the constraints presented by the pressure_jacket ''

The district_court also concluded that the asserted claims were invalid for lack of enablement after considering the specification and the factors set forth in In re Wands 858_F.2d_731_(Fed.Cir.1988)
The court observed that a pressure_jacket was necessary to `` maintain the integrity of the syringe housing against pressures the syringe encounters during operation of the injector ''
The court further noted that the inventors themselves testified as to the importance of the pressure_jacket around the syringe and that the experiments with and testing of jacketless_systems were unsuccessful
The court also relied on testimony of Liebel 's engineers that a jacketless_system was not a mere design option and that one skilled in the art would not know how to make a jacketless_system
The court further found that no prototypes of a jacketless_injector had been made or described at the time of filing and that the state of the art was such that a jacketless_system with a disposable syringe would have been a `` true innovation ''
Thus the court concluded that Medrad had proffered clear and convincing_evidence that the specification does not satisfy the written description and enablement_requirements

With respect to the syringe-sensing patents this appeal challenges the holding of invalidity following our construction of the term `` physical_indicia '' and its relationship to the properties of the syringe
Claim 7 of the ¡¬612_patent is representative of the asserted claims of the syringe-sensing patents and reads as follows : An injector of the type having a motor which advances and retracts a plunger located within a syringe toward and away from a nozzle located at a distal end of the syringe to inject fluid into or out of an animal subject adapted for use with syringe assemblies which have differing capacities comprising : a detector located proximate to a syringe installed on said injector for detecting a physical_indicia [ sic ] on said syringe related to the capacity of said syringe and generating an electrical signal representative of said physical_indicia and
a control_circuit which causes said motor to move and tracks the location of said motor while moving said motor wherein said control_circuit *1376 computes the location of a plunger within said syringe relative to an end of said syringe by relating said electrical signal to the tracked location of said motor
¡¬612_patent col. 18_ll._36 -52 ( emphases added )
The remaining asserted claims of the ¡¬197 and ¡¬612_patent s differ from representative_claim 7 of the ¡¬612_patent in that some are directed to a method of controlling an injector ( claims 4 5 10 11 16 17 22 and 23 of the ¡¬197_patent and claim 10 of the ¡¬612_patent ) and some are dependent claims that recite the additional limitation of ceasing motion of the motor and plunger when the plunger or ram connected to the plunger has reached the end of the syringe ( claims 2 5 8 11 14 17 20 and 23 of the ¡¬197_patent and claims 8_and_11 of the ¡¬612_patent )
In addition the asserted claims of the syringe-sensing patents recite physical_indicia related to properties of the syringe other than the `` capacity of said syringe '' as recited in representative_claim 7 of the ¡¬612_patent
Such properties include the distance of the plunger or ram coupled to the plunger from an end of the syringe ( claims 1 4 13 and 16 of the ¡¬197_patent ) the range of travel of an injector ram coupled to the plunger ( claims 19_and_22 of the ¡¬197_patent ) and the amount of fluid in the syringe ( claims 7_and_10 of the ¡¬197_patent )

In its claim_construction prior to our decision in Liebel_I the district_court had considered the meaning of the term `` physical_indicia ''
It disagreed with Medrad that the term should be limited to indicia representing the length of the extender
The court determined that the claim language was broader than Medrad 's proposed construction because the claims recited syringe properties other than the length of the extender

On appeal in Liebel_I Medrad had argued that we should construe the term `` physical_indicia '' to be limited to features that indicate the length of the extender
Liebel_I 358 F.3d at 912
After considering the language of the claims the specification and the prosecution_history we determined that the district_court correctly concluded that the term `` physical_indicia '' is not limited to indicia related to the length of an extender
Id.at 914
We again stated that we would not construe the claims narrowly because of invalidity concerns and that the issue of invalidity could be addressed on remand
Id

On remand and in light of our construction the district_court determined that Medrad 's accused device did infringe the asserted claims of the syringe-sensing patents but that those claims were invalid for failure to comply with the requirements of ¡± 112 and because of anticipation by Medrad 's U.S._Patent 5,383,858
With regard to written description the district_court stated that there was `` nothing in the written description that describes an invention for detecting indicia ( e.g. ' a tangible mark ' ) on the syringe-other than the limited alternative reference to physical_indicia relating to the length of the extender ''
The district_court noted that the preferred embodiment `` teaches that it is the injector 's face plate which is removable and interchangeable that is 'detected ' by a sensor which in turn tells the circuit board the size of the syringe installed ''
The court also observed that the written description and enablement_requirements often rise and fall together and determined that the asserted claims of the front-loading_patents `` are of a far greater scope than [ Liebel 's ] specification of what it invented or possessed when it filed its application ''
The court concluded that the specification failed to fulfill both the written *1377 description and enablement_requirements set forth in ¡± 112 ?
1

With regard to anticipation the court found that even if it had concluded that Liebel 's patents were not invalid under ¡± 112 the asserted claims of the syringe-sensing patents were anticipated by the prior art ¡¬858_patent
The court found that the ¡¬858_patent clearly describes an indicator mechanism for injecting fluid from a syringe into a patient and that mechanism includes an injector controller and a sensor
The court further determined that the ¡¬858_patent discloses `` physical_indicia '' by describing the use of a bar_code or another readable device on the syringe that stores information about the syringe and that can be read by a sensor
The court determined that the only difference between the asserted claims of the syringe-sensing patents and the invention disclosed in the ¡¬858_patent was the description of the types of indicia detected
For example the ¡¬858_patent describes that the bar_code on the syringe can include information relating to the `` dimensions '' of the syringe whereas the asserted claims recite the `` capacity '' of the syringe
The court found that these were `` semantic differences '' that did not affect its conclusion of anticipation
Hence the court concluded that the ¡¬858_patent anticipates the syringe-sensing patents

In a separate order the district_court considered whether the inventorship designated on the patents was correct and granted Liebel 's motion for partial summary_judgment that it was correct
The court determined that the alleged omitted inventor Kelly did not contribute to the conception of the design and thus was not properly a co-inventor
The court found that the evidence established that Kelly only attended `` brain-storming '' sessions but that there was no clear and convincing_evidence of his being an inventor

The court further determined after resolving the invalidity motions that Medrad 's inequitable conduct claim was moot in light of its invalidity_rulings

Liebel timely appealed and Medrad_cross-appealed
We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
