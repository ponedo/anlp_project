NEWMAN Circuit_Judge
Nintendo of America Inc. appeals the judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Texas holding that certain Nintendo video game controllers infringed certain claims of U.S._Patent 6,906,700 ( the ¡¬700_patent ) owned by Anascape Ltd. and awarding damages.1 After trial to a jury the district_court denied duly made post-trial motions enjoined further_infringement and stayed the injunction pending appeal
On Nintendo 's appeal ( Microsoft settled in the district_court ) the judgment is reversed

DISCUSSION
The field of invention is hand-operated controllers for the movement of images on a computer_screen or television_display particularly as used in video_games
The controller is the tool by which human hands manipulate a graphic image a procedure called `` hand_inputs ''
The hand_inputs are implemented through handles such as joysticks or trackballs whereby the hand actions of the human operator are sensed and translated electronically into corresponding linear and rotational movements that are shown in graphic display
As discussed in the patents in suit hand_inputs move images in six general directions that are called `` degrees of freedom '' ( DOF ) in the lexicon of this technology
Thus the hand_inputs may produce linear movement along three axes ( forward/backward left/right or up/down ) and rotational movement about the three linear axes ( roll pitch or yaw )

The ¡¬700_patent was filed on November 16 2000 as a continuation-in-part of the application that became U.S._Patent 6,222,525 ( the ¡¬525_patent )
The validity of the ¡¬700_patent_claims in suit depends on whether these claims as construed by the district_court are entitled to the filing_date of the ¡¬ 525 patent July_5,_1996
See 35 U.S.C.¡± 120 ( `` An application for patent for an invention disclosed in the manner provided by the first paragraph of section 112 of this title in an application previously filed in the United_States.. shall have *1335 the same effect as to such invention as though filed on the date of the prior application.. '' )
In Reiffin v. Microsoft Corp. 214_F.3d_1342 1345-46 ( Fed.Cir.2000 ) the court explained the need `` to ensure that the scope of the right to exclude as set forth in the claims does not overreach the scope of the inventor 's contribution to the field of art as described in the patent specification ''
This rationale applies to a specification whose filing_date is needed to antedate prior_art
See Moba B.V. v. Diamond Automation Inc. 325_F.3d_1306 1319-20 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) ; Ralston Purina Co. v. Far-Mar-Co Inc. 772_F.2d_1570 1575 ( Fed.Cir.1985 )
Anascape has conceded that if not so entitled the ¡¬700_patent_claims are subject to invalidation based on the intervening prior_art of a Sony `` DualShock '' controller sold in the United_States in 1998 and described in a patent application of Goto published in 1998 and a Sony `` DualShock 2 '' controller sold in the United_States in October 2000
Anascape 's response to this prior_art is that the ¡¬700_patent_claims are entitled to the July_5,_1996 filing_date
The district_court so found ; this is the principal issue on this appeal
