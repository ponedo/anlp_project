BACKGROUND
Appellants Altana Pharma AG and Wyeth accuse appellees Teva_Pharmaceuticals_USA Inc. ( `` Teva '' ) Sun_Pharmaceutical_Industries Ltd. ( `` Sun '' ) et_al
( collectively `` Defendants '' ) of infringing U.S._Patent_No._4758,579 ( `` the ¡¬ 579 patent '' )
Wyeth is the exclusive_licensee of the ¡¬579_patent in the United States
The ¡¬579_patent issued on February 9 1988
On January 4 2004 the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ( `` USPTO '' ) granted a 5-year term extension pursuant to 35 U.S.C.¡± 156 ( `` the Hatch-Waxman_Act '' ) ; thus the ¡¬ 579 patent expires on July_19,_2010

The ¡¬579_patent is directed to the compound_pantoprazole the active_ingredient in Altana 's antiulcer drug Protonix THE_R
The compound_pantoprazole belongs to a class of compounds known as proton pump inhibitors ( `` PPIs '' ) that are used to treat gastric acid disorders in the stomach
PPIs inhibit gastric acid secretion through their action on the gastric_acid_pump
When triggered by the body the gastric_acid_pump is established in the secretory_canaliculus of the stomach 's parietal_cells via the enzyme H + K +-ATPase
Once triggered the pump transports protons H + from the inside of the parietal_cell into the cell 's secretory_canaliculus in exchange for potassium_ions K + which the pump transports from the canaliculus to the inner portion of the cell
The availability of potassium_ions within the canaliculus is attributable to the migration of potassium chloride KCI into the canaliculus also from the inside of the parietal_cell
As the pump reabsorbs the K + in exchange for H + extrusion the CI -remains in the canaliculus resulting in the formation of hydrochloric acid HCI within the canaliculus which is then secreted into the stomach

Although the operation of the gastric_acid_pump was known at the time of the invention at issue the mechanism by which PPIs inhibit the gastric_acid_pump was not understood in the art until after the effective filing date of the ¡¬ 579 patent
Part of the uncertainty surrounding the method of action for PPIs is attributable to the fact *1003 that PPIs are prodrugs which are drugs that convert to their active_form after they are delivered within a patient 's body which typically exhibits a pH of about 5 to about 7
In this regard PPIs are acid-activated prodrugs that are converted into their active_form in the highly acidic environment having a pH of about 1 within the secretory_canaliculus of parietal_cells
Once converted to its active_form the PPI thereafter binds to one or more cysteine amino acids in the acid pump
This binding inhibits the operation of the gastric_acid_pump

The first commercialized PPI compound was omeprazole which was approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( `` FDA '' ) in 1989 under the trade name Prilosec_THE_R
Omeprazole was first synthesized by AB Hassle ( now known as AstraZeneca ) in 1979 and is the subject of U.S._Patent_No._4255,431 ( `` the ¡¬431_patent `` )
Omeprazole or Prilosec_THE_R is well known today as a blockbuster drug for the treatment of patients that suffer from heartburn as well as other symptoms that stem from gastro-esophageal reflux disease ( `` GERD '' )
After the successful commercialization of Prilosec_THE_R many drug companies including Byk Gulden ( Altana 's predecessor ) began to develop new PPIs to compete with omeprazole

Altana 's research efforts resulted in the issuance of U.S._Patent_No._4555,518 ( `` the ¡¬518_patent `` ) and the ¡¬579_patent
The application for the ¡¬518_patent was filed before the ¡¬579_patent and contained a pharmacology section that compared the effectiveness of 18 claimed compounds against four prior art compounds
The ¡¬518_patent refers to one of the 18 compounds chosen for testing as compound 12
The ¡¬579_patent which is not related to the ¡¬518_patent claims PPI compounds that are structurally similar to the compounds claimed in the ¡¬518_patent
Pantoprazole the compound at issue in this litigation exhibits a structure that is very similar to compound 12 from the ¡¬518_patent

There are three main structural elements to the PPI molecular backbone : the benzimidazole ring the methylsulfinyl bridge and the pyridine_ring
The general formula of the PPI disclosed in the ¡¬579_patent is reproduced below :

?
¡¬579_patent at 2:5-15
The issues in this case primarily relate to the pyridine_ring ( the right-most structure on the above compound ) specifically the radicals located on the pyridine_ring ( indicated by R2 R3 and R4 )
The ¡¬ 579 patent teaches that `` R3 represents a 1-3C-alkoxy radical one of the radicals R2 and R4 represents a 1-3C-alkoxy radical and the other represents a hydrogen atom ( -H ) or a 1-3C-alkyl radical ''
Id.at 2:28-31
An alkyl is a radical_consisting of carbon and hydrogen atoms arranged in a chain with the general formula CnH2n+i
A common example is methyl -CH3
An alkoxy is a radical_consisting of an alkyl group linked to oxygen
The most simple is methoxy -OCH3
The only structural difference between compound 12 and pantoprazole is the substituent ( or radical ) at the 3-position of the pyridine_ring
In compound 12 it is a methyl_group ( -CH3 ) *1004 whereas in pantoprazole it is a methoxy_group ( -OCH3 )

On or about April_6,_2004 Teva filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application ( `` ANDA '' ) pursuant to the Hatch-Waxman_Act requesting FDA approval to sell a generic version of Protonix THE_R prior to the expiration of the ¡¬579_patent
Sun filed similarly directed ANDA_applications on or about March_1,_2005 and June_25,_2005
Both Teva and Sun filed paragraph IV certifications in conjunction with their respective ANDA_applications
Following the submission of these ANDA_applications Altana filed suit against Teva and subsequently against Sun
The district_court consolidated these cases

Altana filed a motion for preliminary_injunction on June_22,_2007
In opposition to this motion both Teva and Sun conceded infringement ; however they maintained that the ¡¬579_patent is invalid.1 Specifically the defendants argued that the ¡¬579_patent was obvious in light of the teachings in the following prior art references : ( 1 ) Altana 's ¡¬518_patent ( 2 ) the Sachs article,2 ( 3 ) the Bryson_article,3 and ( 4 ) the ¡¬431_patent ( covering omeprazole )

In the district_court the defendants ' obviousness analysis focused on the selection of compound 12 from the ¡¬518_patent as a lead_compound for modification
The defendants argued that the Sachs article provided motivation for one of skill in the art to lower the pKa of a PPI to a value of 4 in order to provide better stability of the compound in the patient 's body
The pKa_value of a compound is measured on a logarithmic scale and indicates the degree of the willingness of the compound to accept or donate a proton
The lower the numerical pKa of a compound the more acidic and less basic it is
Thus at pH 5 a compound with a pKa of 4 would be more stable than the compound with a pKa of 5
The defendants ' position was that Sachs taught that a pKa_value of 4 was a desirable characteristic in a PPI because it would improve the stability of a PPI in the body prior to its introduction to the parietal_cells of the stomach
The defendants further argued that the Bryson_article taught how to lower the pKa_value
In particular they argued that Bryson taught that a methoxy_group at the 3-position of a pyridine_ring provides a lower pKa than a methyl_group in that same position
Finally the defendants argued that the ¡¬431_patent demonstrated the feasibility of substituting a methoxy_group for a methyl_group at the 3-position of the pyridine_ring in a PPI

The district_court held a hearing to address Altana 's motion for preliminary_injunction
After considering the evidence and the arguments the district_court denied the requested relief
With respect to the likelihood of success on the merits the district_court found that the defendants had demonstrated a substantial question of invalidity and the plaintiffs had not shown that it lacked substantial_merit
In particular the court found that one of skill in the art would have selected compound 12 as a *1005 lead_compound for modification
Next the court agreed with the defendants ' interpretation of the Sachs reference and found that it provided motivation to one of skill in the art to modify compound 12 to achieve a pKa of 4
The district_court also found that the Bryson_article taught that a compound with a methoxy_group in the 3-position of a pyridine_ring as opposed to a methyl_group in that position would lower the pKa_value to a pKa of 4
That court also relied on the ¡¬431_patent to show that such a substitution was feasible
The district_court 's examination of the objective indicia of non-obviousness did not cause it to disregard the prima facie showing of obviousness and the court accordingly found that Altana failed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits

The district_court also considered but rejected Altana 's position on irreparable_harm
Altana argued that the following harms would be irreparable if no preliminary_injunction was issued : irreversible price erosion substantial loss of profits decrease in market share inability to service debts employee layoffs and loss of research opportunities
The district_court found that these harms were not irreparable and that the defendants would be able to satisfy a judgment should Altana prevail at trial
As a result the district_court concluded that Altana had failed to show that it would suffer irreparable_harm if the injunction was not issued

Based on Altana 's failure to establish either a likelihood of success on the merits or irreparable_harm the district_court denied the motion for preliminary_injunction
This appeal followed
We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1292 ( c ) ( 1 )
