United States Court of Appeals Federal Circuit
SCIMED LIFE SYSTEMS INC. Plaintiff-Appellant v. ADVANCED CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEMS INC. Defendant-Appellee
No._99-1499
| DECIDED : March_14,_2001
Synopsis
Holder of three patents for balloon dilation catheters used in coronary_angioplasty_procedures brought patent infringement suit against competitor
The United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of California Martin J. Jenkins J. 1999_WL_398003 granted summary_judgment to competitor
Patent holder appealed
The Court of Appeals Bryson Circuit_Judge held that : ( 1 ) common_specification in patents which referred to an inflation_lumen `` separate from '' guide_wire_lumen disclaimed competitor 's catheter with dual lumens configuration and ( 2 ) patents were not infringed under doctrine of equivalents

BRYSON Circuit_Judge
SciMed_Life_Systems Inc. ( SciMed ) owns three U.S. patents drawn to features of balloon dilatation catheters : U.S. Patent Nos._5156,594 ( the ¡¬ 594 patent ) 5,217,482 ( the ¡¬482_patent ) and 5,395,334 ( the ¡¬334_patent )
SciMed filed suit against Advanced Cardiovascular Systems Inc. ( ACS ) in the United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of California *1339 charging ACS with infringement of each of the three patents
On ACS 's motion for summary_judgment the district_court ruled that ACS had not infringed the disputed patents
The district_court 's ruling was based on the court 's conclusion that the asserted claims were limited to a structure not found in ACS 's accused devices and on the court 's conclusion that ACS 's devices did not infringe SciMed 's patents under the doctrine of equivalents
We agree with the district_court 's claim_construction and its ruling on the equivalents issue
We therefore affirm the summary_judgment of non-infringement

I
Balloon dilatation catheters are used in coronary_angioplasty_procedures to remove restrictions in coronary arteries
The SciMed_patents describe catheters having three sections : a first_shaft_section a second_shaft_section and a transition_section between the two
The first_shaft_section is long relatively stiff and generally tubular
The second_shaft_section is relatively flexible and contains a balloon at the end which is inflated to relieve the arterial_restriction
The transition_section connects the first and second_shaft_sections and provides a gradual transition in stiffness between the two shaft sections

The catheters claimed in the SciMed_patents contain two passageways or lumens
The first lumen the guide-wire_lumen is used to guide the catheter through a patient 's arteries to the site of the arterial_restriction
A guide_wire is first inserted into one of the patient 's arteries
The guide-wire_lumen is then threaded over the guide_wire to guide the catheter through the patient 's arteries until the catheter reaches the coronary restriction
In the invention recited in the SciMed_patents the guide_wire does not enter the catheter at the proximal end of the catheter i.e. the end closer to the surgeon but at a point nearer to the distal end of the catheter i.e. the leading end of the catheter as it is inserted into the patient
The guide-wire_lumen is present only in the distal portion of the catheter and does not extend the entire length of the catheter
The second lumen is the inflation_lumen
It extends through all sections of the catheter and terminates in a connection with the balloon
The balloon is inflated by forcing fluid into the inflation_lumen
The balloon then compresses the material restricting the artery thereby relieving the restriction

The parties agree that only two arrangements of the two lumens are known and practiced in the art
In the dual ( or adjacent ) lumen configuration the two lumens are positioned side-by-side within the catheter
In the coaxial_lumen_configuration the guide_wire_lumen runs inside the inflation_lumen ; in that configuration the inflation_lumen viewed in cross-section is annular in shape
The parties also agree that the accused ACS devices employ only the dual_lumen_configuration and that the preferred embodiment described in the SciMed_patents employs the coaxial_lumen_configuration

Based on language in the common written description portion of the three SciMed_patents the district_court construed the asserted claims of the patents to be limited to catheters with coaxial lumens and not to read on catheters with a dual_lumen_configuration
The court noted that `` the language contained in SciMed 's specifications expressly limits all embodiments of the claimed invention to a coaxial structure ''
The court focused in particular on language from the common_specification describing the coaxial lumen structure as the `` basic sleeve structure for all embodiments of the present invention contemplated and disclosed herein ''
That language the court concluded `` leaves no doubt that a person skilled in the art would conclude that the inventor envisioned only one design *1340 for the catheters taught in SciMed 's patents-an intermediate sleeve section containing two.. lumens arranged coaxially ''

In light of the district_court 's construction of the asserted claims SciMed conceded that ACS 's accused catheters did not literally infringe any of the asserted claims
In addition the court held on summary_judgment that the two lumen arrangements were sufficiently different that no reasonable jury could find the accused catheters to infringe the SciMed_patents under the doctrine of equivalents
SciMed appeals the claim_construction and the summary_judgment based on that construction
