MCI Communications Inc. and Verizon_Business_Global_LLC ( collectively *1329 `` Verizon '' ) appeal from a final judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Virginia entered after a jury found : ( 1 ) claims 5_and_6 of U.S._Patent_No._6282,574 ( `` the ¡¬574_patent `` ) and claims 1 3 and 11 of U.S._Patent_No._6104,711 ( `` the ¡¬711_patent `` ) invalid ; and ( 2 ) claim 1 of U.S._Patent_No._6430,275 ( `` the ¡¬275_patent `` ) ; claims 1 19 27 and 35 of U.S._Patent_No._6292,481 ( `` the ¡¬481_patent `` ) ; claim 1 of U.S._Patent_No._6137,869 ( `` the ¡¬869_patent `` ) ; and claims 12 13 and 20 of U.S._Patent_No._6636,597 ( `` the ¡¬597_patent `` ) not infringed by Cox Fibernet Virginia Inc. Cox_Virginia_Telecom Inc. Cox_Communications_Hampton_Roads LLC Coxcom Inc. and Cox_Communications Inc. ( collectively `` Cox '' )
See Verizon_Servs Corp. v. Cox_Fibernet_Va. Inc. No._08-_CV-0157 ( E.D.Va

v. Cox_Fibernet_Va. Inc. 08-CV-0157 ( E.D.Va
Nov._7,_2008 ) ( order denying cross-motions for judgment as a matter of law and new_trial ) ; Verizon_Servs Corp. v. Cox_Fibernet_Va. Inc. No._08-_CV-0157 ( E.D.Va
Nov._11,_2008 ) ( agreed order amending and clarifying the judgment )
On appeal both parties challenge the district_court 's denial of their respective motions for judgment as a matter of law and motions for new_trial
Because the evidence introduced at trial supports the jury 's verdict and because the district_court did not err in instructing the jury on the scope of the claims we affirm

BACKGROUND
A
The Patents at Issue
The six patents at issue in this appeal are owned by Verizon and relate generally to packet-switched telephony-technology for providing telephone_calls by breaking up voice signals and sending the resulting data in packets not all of which need traverse the same path through a network
Packet-switched telephony increases the efficiency of the underlying network over traditional circuit switching which relies on a dedicated path between endpoints of a call

To explain the technology involved in the six asserted patents the parties divide them into three groups : the ¡¬711 and ¡¬574_patent s ( the `` Feature Patents '' ) the ¡¬275 ¡¬869 and ¡¬481_patent s ( the `` Network Patents '' ) and the ¡¬597_patent ( the `` Quality of Service Patent '' )
None of the claims in any of the patents at issue in this appeal refer explicitly to the Internet or to a `` public packet data network '' which this court has previously equated to the Internet
Verizon_Servs Corp. v. Vonage Holdings Corp. 503_F.3d_1295 1305 ( Fed.Cir.2007 )
Instead the asserted claims refer to `` packet switched networks '' `` circuit switched networks '' and a `` system of interlinked packet data networks ''
