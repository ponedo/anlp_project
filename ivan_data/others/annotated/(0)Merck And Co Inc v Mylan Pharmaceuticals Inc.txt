No._99-1044
| Sept._3,_1999
Synopsis
Patentee brought action against competitor for infringement of two patents directed to controlled release_formulation of drug combination used to treat Parkinson 's disease
The United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Pennsylvania Eduardo C. Robreno J. 19_F.Supp.2d_334 granted summary_judgment of noninfringement and patentee appealed
The Court of Appeals Pauline Newman Circuit_Judge held that : ( 1 ) fact that patentee was required by examiner to elect a species from proposed genus of polymers listed in patent application did not establish that resulting amendment was not made to overcome patentability rejection and ( 2 ) infringement claim was barred by prosecution_history_estoppel

Opinion
PAULINE NEWMAN Circuit_Judge
Merck & Co. Inc. appeals from the decision of the United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Pennsylvania1 wherein the court granted summary_judgment that Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. did not infringe Merck 's United States Patents Nos._4832,957 ( '957_patent ) and 4,900,755 ( '755_patent )
The judgment is affirmed

BACKGROUND
The '957 and '755_patent s are directed to a controlled release_formulation of a combination of the drugs levodopa and carbidopa used to treat Parkinson 's disease
This combination of drugs was known for this use but when used in an immediate release_formulation the combination was subject to side_effects such as `` wearing-off '' and `` on-off '' phenomena
It was known that the controlled release of levodopa and carbidopa over a period of time ameliorates these side_effects and that certain polymeric vehicles implement controlled release

According to the patents in suit the desired controlled release is achieved by delivering these drugs in a polymer_vehicle the specific composition of which is the issue in this dispute
In Merck 's '957_patent claim 1 ( the broadest claim ) recites a combination of carbidopa and levodopa in a combination of polymers that comprises 5-25 mg of hydroxypropyl cellulose ( HPC ) and 2-50 mg of polyvinyl acetate-crotonic_acid ( PVACA ) : 1
A controlled release_oral_dosage_formulation comprising a uniform_dispersion of 25-100 mg of carbidopa 100_to_400 mg of levodopa 1-10 mg of a tablet lubricant and in mixture thereof with a pharmaceutically acceptable dye in a polymer_vehicle comprising 5-25 mg of water-soluble_hydroxypropyl cellulose [ HPC ] polymer and 2-50 mg of a less_water-soluble_polyvinyl_acetate-crotonic_acid [ PVACA ] copolymer whereby following administration the carbidopa and levodopa are released slowly and simultaneously from the formulation
( Emphasis and acronyms added )

The '755_patent is a division of the '957_patent and claims the same combination polymer_vehicle : 1
A controlled release_oral_dosage_formulation comprising a uniform_dispersion of 25-100 mg of carbidopa and 100_to_400 mg of levodopa in a polymer_vehicle comprising 5-25 mg of a water-soluble_hydroxypropyl cellulose [ HPC ] polymer and 2-50 mg of a less_water-soluble_polyvinyl_acetate-crotonic_acid [ PVACA ] copolymer whereby following administration the carbidopa and levodopa are released slowly and simultaneously from the formulation

Mylan filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application with the Food and Drug Administration for a product containing 50 mg of carbidopa 200 mg of levodopa 29.3 mg of water-soluble HPC polymer and 12.8 mg of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose ( HPMC )
Merck brought suit pursuant to 35 U.S.C.¡± 271 ( e ) ( 2 ) ( A ) 2 charging Mylan with infringement under the doctrine of *1338 equivalents of claims 1-3 of each of the '957 and '755_patent s. No charge of literal infringement was made for Mylan 's polymer_vehicle is not identical to that of the claims
However Merck asserts that the polymer_vehicle in Mylan 's product ( 29.3 mg of HPC and 12.8 mg of HPMC ) is equivalent to Merck 's claimed polymer_vehicle ( 5-25 mg of HPC and 2-50 mg of PVACA )
Merck states that any difference is insubstantial in that the HPMC and PVACA are interchangeable in this use for both are less_water-soluble than HPC

Mylan moved for summary_judgment of non-infringement arguing that the prosecution histories of the '957 and '755_patent s estopped Merck from asserting that Mylan 's product infringed under the doctrine of equivalents and also that the prior_art prevented application of the doctrine of equivalents to reach Mylan 's formulation
The district court granted summary_judgment of non-infringement holding that both prosecution_history_estoppel and the prior_art preclude a finding of equivalency
This appeal followed

We review de novo the correctness of the grant of summary_judgment including the issues of estoppel and the effect of the prior_art on application of the doctrine of equivalents
