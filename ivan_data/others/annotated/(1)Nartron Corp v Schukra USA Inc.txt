Opinion
LOURIE Circuit_Judge
Nartron Corporation ( `` Nartron '' ) appeals from the judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Michigan granting summary_judgment of dismissal of its patent infringement complaint because of Nartron 's failure to join an alleged co-inventor on U.S. Patent 6,049,748 ( `` the ¡¬748_patent `` ) as a plaintiff
See Nartron Corp. v. Borg_Indak Inc. No._06-10683 2008_WL_896060 ( E.D.Mich
Mar
31 2008 )
Because Joseph Benson the alleged co-inventor provided only an insignificant contribution to the invention of claim 11 of the ¡¬748_patent by contributing an `` extender '' we reverse the grant of summary_judgment to Borg_Indak Incorporated ( `` Borg_Indak '' ) and remand to the district_court for further action consistent with this opinion

BACKGROUND
Schukra U.S.A. Incorporated ( `` Schukra '' ) supplies automobile manufacturers *1354 with lumbar_support systems for automobile_seats
In 1996 Schukra contracted with Nartron for Nartron to design a control_system that would provide existing automobile_seats with massage_functionality
Nartron designed such a system and then applied for a patent relating to a vehicle seat_control_system that provides massage capability ; that patent application matured into the ¡¬748_patent

Borg_Indak supplies electronic components to Schukra
In 2006 Nartron sued Borg_Indak for contributory infringement of claims 1_and_7 of the ¡¬748_patent
Borg_Indak moved for summary_judgment of dismissal alleging that Benson a Schukra employee was a co-inventor of claim 11 of the ¡¬748_patent and therefore needed to have been joined in the suit
Neither Schukra nor Benson had consented to or had joined the suit

Claim 11 for which Benson is alleged to be a co-inventor is a dependent claim
It depends from claim 6 which in turn depends from claim 5 which itself depends from claim 1
Claims 1 5 6 and 11 read as follows : 1
A seat_control_module for introducing massage to a seat_control with an adjustable lumbar_support and control_actuators the control_module comprising : a modular housing including in-line connectors for coupling said module to a seat_control harness connector ; an intercept interface for receiving inputs from said control_actuators ; a driver for repeatedly adjusting said lumbar_support_position through a predetermined range of movement in response to one of said control_actuators ; and
a transparency_simulator for maintaining full function of said seat_control and removing indications of repeatedly adjusting said lumbar_support_position
... 5
The invention as defined in claim 1 wherein said transparency_simulator comprises time-based response to manipulation of said control_actuators
6
The invention as defined in claim 5 wherein said transparency_simulator generates a first output in response to a manipulation of a said control_actuator for a period of time less than a first predetermined period and generating a second output in response to a manipulation of said control_actuator for a period equal to or greater than said first predetermined time period
... 11
The invention as defined in claim 6 wherein said lumbar_support_adjustor includes an extender
¡¬748_patent col. 19 l.13-col.20 l.31
Thus the key additional limitation in claim 11 which Benson is alleged to have contributed is an extender for a lumbar_support_adjustor

The specification provides only the following description of the extender : `` A second motor 28 controls a lumbar_support extender 30 and it governs the degree to which the lumbar_support extends outwardly from the seat back toward a spinal curvature of an occupant
Both mechanisms 26_and_30 affect the position of the lumbar_support 32 of the seat mechanism 16 ''
Id.at col.4 ll.28-33
The figures simply represent the extender 30 as a box in the circuit diagram of the control_system
Id.at Figs
1 & 2 ( numeral 30 )

The inventors listed on the ¡¬748_patent all Nartron employees presumptively invented *1355 the control_system
However they admit that they did not invent the lumbar_support_adjustor including an extender recited in claim 11 as Nartron 's inventive contribution consisted of a control_module that operated on existing automobile_seats some of which already included extenders for lumbar_support_adjustors
Benson claims to have provided Nartron with the idea for the extender for a lumbar_support_adjustor although he admits that the idea of an extender for a lumbar_support_adjustor in an automobile seat was in the prior_art
Oral Argument at 11:38-12:30 available at http : //oral arguments.cafc.uscourts.gov/mp3/2008-1363.mp3 ( `` If you isolate the specific arm that extends out that was in the prior_art with respect to other lumbar_supports
`` )

In March 2008 the district_court granted Borg_Indak 's motion for summary_judgment of dismissal
The court held that Benson was a co-inventor of the ¡¬ 748 patent because according to the court he had conceived of the extender element of claim 11 and as a co-inventor he was required to have been joined as a plaintiff in any infringement suit
The court reasoned that contrary to Nartron 's arguments the ¡¬748_patent was not based exclusively on the control_module and its software and that the contribution of the mechanical extender to the claimed invention was not insignificant in quality because Benson had conceived of the massager unit and had developed a prototype
The court also found that there was no genuine issue of material fact regarding who had invented the extender because the named inventors had conceded that they did not invent the extender and Benson had provided evidence that he had been working on a lumbar_support frame or basket ( which operated as an extender ) that provided a massage effect
The court also relied on Nartron 's failure to provide any evidence to contradict Benson 's evidence that he had conceived and reduced to practice an extender for a lumbar_support_adjustor
The court thus dismissed the case for failure to join a necessary plaintiff in the lawsuit
Benson 's employer Schukra maintained a contractual relationship with the defendant Borg_Indak
Thus grant of the motion to dismiss effectively prevented Nartron from enjoining or obtaining damages from Borg_Indak for patent infringement

Nartron timely appealed the district_court 's dismissal
We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
