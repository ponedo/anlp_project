MYLAN INSTITUTIONAL LLC Apicore_US_LLC Plaintiffs-Appellees
v. AUROBINDO PHARMA LTD. Aurobindo_Pharma_USA_Inc. Auromedics_Pharma_LLC Defendants-Appellants
2017-1645
| Decided : May_19,_2017
Synopsis
Background : Patentee and exclusive_licensee brought action against competitor alleging infringement of patents directed to process for preparing isosulfan blue ( ISB ) product by reacting isoleuco_acid with silver_oxide in a polar_solvent followed by reaction with a sodium_solution and patent directed to ISB_compound having purity greater than 99.0 % as measured by high_performance_liquid_chromatography ( HPLC )
The United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Texas No._2 :16-cv-00491-RWS-RSP Robert Schroeder III J. 2017_WL_497593 entered preliminary_injunction against competitor after adopting the report and recommendation of Roy S. Payne United States Magistrate Judge 2016_WL_7587325
Competitor appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Lourie Circuit_Judge held that :

substantial_question existed concerning infringement of process_patents ;

competitor did not raise substantial_question as to whether purity_patent was anticipated and thus invalid on basis that ISB was known in prior_art ;

competitor did not raise substantial_question regarding motivation to combine references or reasonable_expectation of success and consequently whether purity_patent was obvious ;

evidence of secondary_considerations weighed in favor of conclusion that district_court did not abuse its discretion in granting preliminary_injunction ;

competitor did not raise substantial_question as to whether purity_patent was indefinite and thus invalid on basis of lack of specific HPLC parameters ; and

patentee would have been irreparably harmed without preliminary_injunction

Affirmed

Lourie Circuit_Judge
Aurobindo_Pharma_Ltd. Aurobindo_Pharma_USA_Inc. and Auromedics_Pharma_LLC ( together `` Aurobindo '' ) appeal from a decision of the United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Texas granting Mylan_Institutional_LLC 's ( `` Mylan_Inst '' )
and Apicore_US_LLC 's ( `` Apicore '' ) ( together `` Mylan '' ) motion for a preliminary_injunction precluding Aurobindo from making using selling offering to sell and importing the accused isosulfan blue ( `` ISB '' ) product that allegedly infringes three of Apicore 's patents-U.S._Patent 7,622,992 ( `` the '992_patent `` ) U.S._Patent 8,969,616 ( `` the '616_patent `` ) and U.S._Patent 9,353,050 ( `` the '050_patent `` )

Because the district_court did not err in its grant of the preliminary_injunction under the '050_patent although it did err in granting the injunction under the '992 and '616_patent s we affirm

BACKGROUND
Apicore owns and Mylan_Inst
is the exclusive_licensee of the '992 '616 and '050_patent s which relate to ISB a triarylmethane dye used to map lymph nodes
The '992 and '616_patent s ( together `` the process_patents '' ) are directed to a process for preparing ISB by reacting isoleuco_acid with silver_oxide in a polar_solvent followed by reaction with a sodium_solution
See e.g. '992_patent col. 7_ll._21 -44.1 The '992_patent further requires 2.0-3.0 equivalents of silver_oxide
See id
col. 9_l._65
Claim 1 of the '616_patent is representative of the process_patents and reads as follows : A process of preparing N- [ 4- [ [ 4- ( diethyl-amino ) phenyl ] ( 2,5-disulfophenyl ) methylene ] -2,5-cyclohexadien-1-ylidene ] -N-ethylethanaminium sodium_salt comprising combining a suspension of isoleuco_acid of the formula
*862

?
in a polar_solvent with silver_oxide recovering isosulfan_blue_acid and treating the isosulfan_blue_acid with a sodium_solution
'616_patent col. 9_ll._38 -64 ( emphasis added )
Claim 1 of the '992_patent adds the limitation that 2.0-3.0 equivalents of silver_oxide are employed in the process but otherwise resembles the claim shown above
See '992_patent col. 9_ll._41 -67
The '050_patent ( which the parties refer to as `` the purity_patent '' ) is directed to an ISB_compound having a purity greater than 99.0 % as measured by high_performance_liquid_chromatography ( `` HPLC '' )
See '050_patent col. 9_ll._54 -58
Claim 1 is illustrative and reads as follows : A compound N- [ 4- [ [ 4- ( diethylamino ) phenyl ] ( 2,5-disulfophenyl ) methylene ] -2,5-cyclohexadien-1-ylidene ] -N-ethylethanaminium sodium_salt having a purity of at least 99.0 % by HPLC

Around 1981 Hirsch Industries ( `` Hirsch '' ) developed a 1 % injectable solution of ISB which it commercialized under the trade name LymphazurinTHE_R
Covidien Ltd. ( `` Covidien '' ) the successor-in-interest to Hirsch held the original new drug application ( `` NDA '' ) and was the sole_supplier of LymphazurinTHE_R for 30 years
From its inception LymphazurinTHE_R 's production had been plagued by difficulties in synthesizing and purifying ISB
Hirsch 's original clinical trials described the mixture as containing 94.5 % ISB as determined by HPLC with the remaining 5.5 % consisting of `` closely related isomers '' produced during synthesis

For 26 years following the Food and Drug Administration 's ( `` FDA '' ) approval of ISB Sigma-Aldrich Corp. ( `` Sigma '' ) supplied Hirsch and its successors with ISB that was manufactured by Allied Chemical Corp. ( `` Allied '' )
Allied 's manufacturing process was unknown but analysis of its ISB indicated the presence of lead which suggested the use of a lead compound in synthesis
Sigma developed an isolation process to remove the unwanted lead but the ultimate purity of the ISB it sold was unknown
In 2000 Allied stopped supplying Sigma with ISB and while Sigma was looking for a new_supplier Covidien was forced to notify its customers that it was `` completely out of '' LymphazurinTHE_R until it could find a new_supplier for ISB
Id.at *2 ( internal_quotation_marks omitted )
By 2008 Sigma had a *863 new_supplier Innovassynth which synthesized ISB using ammonium dichromate resulting in residual chromium impurities
Sigma reported numerous problems with the purity of Innovassynth 's product and eventually developed its own manufacturing process for ISB sometime around 2010

Apicore was founded in 2003 and began developing an improved process for synthesizing ISB
In 2004 Apicore partnered with Synerx Pharma LLC ( `` Synerx '' ) Mylan_Inst
's predecessor to develop and market a generic version of LymphazurinTHE_R
In 2007 Apicore filed a patent application that ultimately led to the process and '050_patent s. Based on the claimed process Synerx ( acquired by Mylan_Inst
in 2012 ) filed an abbreviated new drug application ( `` ANDA '' ) seeking FDA_approval to market a generic_LymphazurinTHE_R ; the FDA approved the ANDA in 2010
By 2011 ISB sales were a significant portion of Apicore 's revenue and in 2012 Covidien withdrew LymphazurinTHE_R from the market for `` reasons other than safety or effectiveness ''
Id.at *3 ( internal_quotation_marks omitted )
Mylan_Inst
became the sole_supplier of the 1 % ISB drug product until 2016 when Aurobindo entered the market

Aurobindo sought FDA_approval for a generic_LymphazurinTHE_R informing the FDA that it had studied a `` number of patents '' describing ISB manufacture and selected inter alia Apicore 's '992_patent and that it `` considered the process described [ therein ] for the initial sample preparation and further the optimization of the process ''
Id
( internal_quotation_marks omitted )
Aurobindo acknowledged to the FDA that it was looking for a reagent `` other than silver_oxide ''
Id
( internal_quotation_marks omitted )
It eventually selected manganese_dioxide and its process resulted in ISB with a 5-10 % impurity which could not be removed by recrystallization
Instead it used preparatory HPLC to achieve an ISB purity of greater than 99.5 %
Mylan sued Aurobindo for infringement and sought a preliminary_injunction which the district_court granted

First the district_court2 evaluated the likelihood of success on the merits and found that Aurobindo likely infringed the process_patents under the doctrine of equivalents
Id.at *10-12
The court found that the difference in oxidation_strength between silver_oxide and manganese_dioxide is `` irrelevant '' under both the `` function-way-result '' ( `` FWR '' ) and `` insubstantial differences '' tests for equivalence as applied to the `` face of the claims '' because the claims do not specify a requirement of oxidation_strength
Id.at *11
Further the court explained that even if oxidation_strength were relevant it `` finds manganese_dioxide to be a mild oxidant equivalent to silver_oxide in the context of the [ process_patents ] ''
Id
The court credited Dr. Sessler 's ( Mylan 's expert ) testimony in light of record evidence that the silver_oxide and manganese_dioxide processes produce crude ISB in similar yields
The court explained that if manganese_dioxide were a substantially stronger oxidizing agent than silver_oxide a skilled artisan `` would expect different results ''
Id.at *12

The district_court found that Aurobindo did not raise a substantial_question of validity of the '050_patent based on its arguments that the process patent is invalid : ( 1 ) under ¡± 112 because the `` by HPLC '' limitation renders the claims indefinite ; ( 2 ) under ¡± 103 because the claims would have been obvious over various combinations of art ; and ( 3 ) under ¡± 102 because *864 the claims are anticipated by Sigma 's manufacture and sale of ISB

On the issue of indefiniteness the district_court credited Sessler 's testimony and found that `` by HPLC '' was a common and well-understood way of designating or determining purity as seen in `` numerous sources '' including other patents and the scientific literature
Id.at *8-9
Thus the court concluded that Aurobindo had not raised a substantial_question of validity of the '050_patent under ¡± 112
Id

The district_court also rejected Aurobindo 's obviousness argument finding that Aurobindo did not raise a substantial_question regarding motivation to combine the references or a reasonable_expectation of success
See id.at *22
The court noted that `` a purified compound is not always prima facie obvious over the [ prior_art ] mixture '' if the process to arrive at the purified compound is itself of patentable_weight
Id.at *18 ( citing Aventis Pharma Deutschland GmbH v. Lupin Ltd. 499_F.3d_1293 1301 ( Fed
Cir
2007 ) ) ( internal_quotation_marks omitted )
The court concluded that Apicore 's process leading to the purified compound claimed in the '050_patent constituted `` an invention of patentable_weight itself '' and thus the purity claims would not necessarily have been prima facie obvious over the prior_art mixture of ( less pure ) ISB and `` closely related isomer [ ] '' by-products
Id.at *18 *19 ( internal_quotation_marks omitted )

The district_court credited Mylan 's evidence of secondary_considerations-specifically long-felt but unmet need commercial success copying/praise of others and unexpected results
Id.at *20-22
The court pointed to the failure of Allied Sigma Innovassynth and others in the art to `` reliably '' produce `` high-purity '' ISB for 30 years
Id.at *20
And the court emphasized that Aurobindo `` admitted to the FDA '' that it had copied the '992_patent
Id.at *21
Thus the court concluded that Aurobindo had not raised a substantial_question that the '050_patent is invalid as obvious
Id

The district_court also concluded that Aurobindo had not raised a substantial_question that the '050_patent claims were anticipated under ¡± 102 ( b ) and ¡± 102 ( g ) ( 2 ) by Sigma 's manufacture and sale of ISB
See id.at *13
Aurobindo argued that Sigma had made and sold ISB having a purity of greater than 99.0 % six years before the '050_patent priority date
See id
Aurobindo supported its position by citing a Sigma Certificate of Analysis which indicated that a compound named `` Patent_Violet_Blue '' with a certain product number and Lot number possessed a purity that was 100 % by HPLC
Id
The court rejected Aurobindo 's argument finding that : ( 1 ) it is not clear that at the time of the Certificate Sigma 's use of the term `` Patent_Violet_Blue '' referred to ISB because other Sigma documents indicate that `` Patent_Violet_Blue '' referred to several blue dye compounds with different structures ; and ( 2 ) the record established that the Certificate is inaccurate because it `` contradicts numerous other Sigma [ ] documents '' that report a different purity for samples from the same Lot
Id.at *14
Thus the court concluded that Aurobindo had not raised a substantial_question that the '050_patent is invalid as anticipated
Id

Second the district_court found that Apicore3 would be irreparably harmed without a preliminary_injunction and identified four `` hallmark examples '' of irreparable harm that are demonstrated by the *865 record : lost sales ; lost R & D ; price erosion ; and that Apicore must now directly compete with an infringer
Id.at *23 ; Order Adopting R & R 2017_WL_497593 at *1

The district_court found a `` causal nexus '' between Aurobindo 's infringement and Apicore 's harm in that Aurobindo 's product `` would not be on the market if [ it ] had not obtained [ FDA ] approval for a product that will likely be found to be covered by the patents ''
Order Adopting R & R 2017_WL_497593 at *1
The court noted that `` [ w ] ithout infringing the '992 '616 and '050_patent s Aurobindo would not be able to make the [ ISB ] product described in its ANDA '' because Aurobindo 's ANDA application touted greater than 99.0 % purity for ISB
Report and Recommendation 2016_WL_7587325 at *24

Third the district_court found that the balance of equities weighed in favor of granting the injunction
Id
The court emphasized that Apicore `` stands to lose its entire [ ISB ] business.. which it relies on to fund ongoing research and development '' and that Aurobindo was aware of Apicore 's patented process and copied it
Id
Thus the court found that the balance of equities favored Apicore
Id
( citing Windsurfing Int ' l Inc. v. AMF Inc. 782_F.2d_995 1003 ( Fed
Cir
1986 ) ( `` One who elects to build a business on a product found [ likely ] to infringe can not be heard to complain if an injunction against continuing infringement destroys the business so elected
`` ) )

Finally the district_court found that the public interest factor also favored granting the preliminary_injunction
The court observed that Apicore satisfied its end of the patent bargain by disclosing its method for preparing ISB and that it would likely not have done so if it had known that a competitor would use that method to destroy its ISB business before it `` could make it to trial ''
Id
The court emphasized that the public interest in obtaining lower-priced pharmaceutical compounds can not justify `` entirely eliminating the exclusionary rights covered by pharmaceutical patents ''
Id
