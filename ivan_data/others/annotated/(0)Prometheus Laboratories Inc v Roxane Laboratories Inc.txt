Assignee appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Dyk Circuit_Judge held that :

patent was obvious ;

secondary_considerations did not support conclusion that patent was not obvious ; and

Opinion
DYK Circuit_Judge
Prometheus Laboratories Inc. ( `` Prometheus '' ) appeals a judgment of the U.S. District Court for the District of New_Jersey holding the amended claims of U.S. Patent No._6284,770 ( `` the ¡¬770_patent `` ) invalid
The district_court found the claims would have been obvious over the prior_art or in the alternative invalid on grounds of obviousness-type_double_patenting over U.S. Patent No._5360,800 ( `` the ¡¬800_patent `` )
We affirm the district_court 's decision because the claims of the ¡¬770_patent are invalid as obvious over the ¡¬800_patent and other prior_art and do not reach the issue of double_patenting

BACKGROUND
Irritable bowel syndrome ( `` IBS '' ) is a condition defined and diagnosed by its constellation of symptoms
Patients may suffer from diarrhea-predominant_IBS ( `` IBS-D '' ) constipation-predominant_IBS ( `` IBS-C '' ) or less often mixed IBS ( `` IBS-M '' ) or alternating IBS ( `` IBS-A '' )
A patient 's symptoms define the type of IBS with which a patient is diagnosed

In this case Prometheus the owner of the ¡¬770_patent sued Roxane Laboratories Inc. ( `` Roxane '' ) and Cipla Ltd. ( `` Cipla '' ) ( together `` defendants '' ) alleging infringement of claims 5 6 10 13 and 14 of the ¡¬ 770 patent
As described below the ¡¬770_patent claims a method of treatment for IBS-D utilizing alosetron ( known by the *1095 brand name Lotronex )
The question is whether these claims of the ¡¬770_patent would have been obvious over various prior_art references or are invalid for obviousness-type_double_patenting over the prior ¡¬800_patent

Prometheus also owns the ¡¬800_patent which also covers the use of alosetron for treatment of IBS
The ¡¬800_patent issued on November 1 1994 and has now expired.1 The ¡¬800_patent is prior_art to the ¡¬770_patent asserted here
Claim 17 of the ¡¬800_patent is directed to `` [ a ] method of treating a condition [ such as IBS ] which is ameliorated by antagonism of 5-HT3 receptors which comprises administering to a patient an effective_amount of [ alosetron ] ''
¡¬800_patent col. 38_ll._7 -12
Claim 27 of the ¡¬ 800 patent covers `` [ a ] method according to claim 17 for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome ''
Id.at col. 38_ll._50 -51

The ¡¬770_patent entitled `` Medicaments for the Treatment of Non-Constipated Female Irritable Bowel Syndrome '' is also directed to a method of treating IBS patients using alosetron
The ¡¬770_patent has a priority date of October 7 1997
After the ¡¬770_patent issued Prometheus initiated an ex parte reexamination of the ¡¬770_patent and a reexamination certificate was issued on October 19 2010
During reexamination Prometheus amended claim 5 to add new claim limitations ( those new limitations are underlined below ) and added inter_alia claims 10_and_13

Reexamined claims 5 10 and 13 provide : 5
A method for treating a diarrhea-predominant_female_IBS_patient while excluding those with predominant_constipation said method_comprising : assessing whether said diarrhea-predominant_female_IBS_patient has experienced symptoms for at least six months ; and
administering an effective_amount of alosetron or a pharmaceutically acceptable_derivative thereof to said patient who has experienced symptoms for at least six months wherein said effective_amount is dependent on the condition of the patient and is at the discretion of the attendant_physician
10
The method for treating according to claim 5 further comprising assessing whether said female IBS patient has experienced at least_moderate_pain prior to administration of alosetron
13
A method for treating a diarrhea-predominant_female_IBS_patient while excluding those with predominant_constipation said method_comprising : assessing whether said diarrhea-predominant_female_IBS_patient has experienced symptoms for at least six months ; assessing whether said nonconstipated female IBS patient experiences at least_moderate_baseline_pain from IBS ; and
administering an effective_amount of alosetron or a pharmaceutically acceptable_derivative thereof to said patient who has experienced symptoms for at least six months and who experiences at least_moderate_baseline_pain from IBS wherein said effective_amount is dependent on the condition of the patient and is at the discretion of the attendant_physician
Ex Parte Reexamination Certificate ¡¬770_patent
Claims 6_and_14 which depend from claims 5_and_13 respectively limit alosetron to its hydrochloride salt form

*1096 Some background information on the history of Lotronex is helpful to understanding the issues here
Shortly before the issuance of the ¡¬770_patent Lotronex was approved by the FDA as a treatment for IBS and was launched in 2000
That same year the drug had to be taken off the market because of serious_side_effects including death
The drug was re-launched in 2002 with a new more restrictive_label new warnings about side effects and a risk management program
After reintroduction the label specified that Lotronex is indicated only for women with severe_IBS-D who have inter_alia chronic symptoms generally lasting six months or longer and should not be used on patients with constipation-indications that correspond to the limitations of the amended ¡¬770_patent claims
The label also included so-called `` black_box '' warnings regarding the potential for serious_side_effects and repeated that Lotronex should only be prescribed to women with severe diarrhea-predominant_IBS who have not responded adequately to conventional_therapy

Following reintroduction the number of severe_incidents associated with Lotronex dropped but the rate of adverse events did not change
The district_court found that `` [ l ] imiting the patient_population to women with severe_IBS-D did not change the risk profile for Lotronex
Even when limited to that cohort of the patient_population Lotronex 's incidence of complications did not decrease ''
J.A
12
The district_court also found that the decrease in the number of severe_incidents is less likely due to the more restrictive_label and : more likely attributable to other changes in how Lotronex is prescribed
For example Lotronex can only be prescribed pursuant to a REMS ( Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies ) which requires patients and doctors to complete a form that highlights the risks ; Lotronex 's label now has `` black_box '' warnings about the drug 's potential side effects and instructs doctors that it should only be prescribed to patients with severe_IBS-D who have not responded to conventional_therapy ; and its prior removal from the market caused doctors to be more vigilant with respect to complications
These cautionary steps are not claimed in the ¡¬770_patent
J.A
13 ( citations omitted )

In 2009 Roxane filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application ( `` ANDA '' ) with the Food and Drug Administration ( `` FDA '' ) seeking approval to commercially market a generic version of Lotronex prior to the expiration of the ¡¬770_patent
In 2010 following the relisting in the Orange Book of the ¡¬770_patent after its reexamination Roxane submitted to the FDA a paragraph IV certification that the patent was non-infringed or invalid

In 2011 Prometheus filed suit against defendants alleging infringement of reexamined claims 5 6 10 13 and 14 of the ¡¬770_patent based on the filing of the ANDA an artificial act of infringement
See 35 U.S.C.¡± 271 ( e ) ( 2 )
Prometheus alleged inter_alia that Roxane 's label would encourage doctors to prescribe alosetron in a manner that infringes the claims
Cipla a defendant-appellee manufactures the active pharmaceutical ingredient alosetron hydrochloride used in Roxane 's ANDA products

After a bench_trial the district_court held that the asserted claims of the ¡¬ 770 patent would have been obvious when considering the prior_art and secondary_considerations of nonobviousness
The district_court found that `` the elements of the ¡¬770_patent were present in the prior_art and the differences between the prior_art and the claims of the ¡¬770_patent are insubstantial.. [ as ] some of the prior_art is *1097 virtually identical to the claimed inventions ''
J.A
44
The district_court also found that the asserted claims of the ¡¬770_patent would have been obvious in light of secondary_considerations
The district_court found that it was not unexpected for alosetron to exhibit greater_efficacy in IBS-D patients who have exhibited symptoms for greater than six months and who have experienced at least_moderate_pain
The district_court held that the limited evidence at trial did not establish that there is an unexpected result of greater_efficacy in women
The district_court concluded that `` [ a ] t best the claims at issue are a combination of known elements combined in a known way to produce expected results ''
J.A
47
As noted above the district_court found that the clinical improvement of reintroduced Lotronex was due to factors other than the ¡¬ 770 patent
Moreover the district_court found that any commercial_success of reintroduced Lotronex could not be attributed to the method claimed in the ¡¬770_patent but rather was due to Prometheus ' marketing and sales practices
Finally the district_court found that the method claimed in the ¡¬ 770 patent did not satisfy a long-felt but unmet need
Thus `` [ a ] fter considering the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art the scope and content of the prior_art compared to the claimed invention and the objective considerations of nonobviousness '' the district_court held that `` the claims of ¡¬770_patent considered as a whole are obvious ''
J.A
44
In the alternative the district_court held that the claims were invalid for obviousness-type_double_patenting in light of the claims of the ¡¬800_patent2 Given its invalidity rulings the district_court did not reach the issue of infringement
