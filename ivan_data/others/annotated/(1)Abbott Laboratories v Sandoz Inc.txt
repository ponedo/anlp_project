Background : Patent owner brought action against competitor alleging infringement of its patents relating to extended_release_formulations of clarithromycin
The United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of Illinois David H. Coar J. 500_F.Supp.2d_807 granted owner 's motion for preliminary_injunction and denied competitor 's motion for stay of injunction pending appeal 500_F.Supp.2d_846
Competitor appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Newman Circuit_Judge held that :

finding of inequitable_conduct was not appropriate ;

patent owner had substantial_likelihood of success on merits of claim that its patents were not likely to be held unenforceable based on inequitable_conduct ;

owner had substantial_likelihood of success on merits of claim that its patents were infringed ;

owner would likely suffer irreparable harm by market share and revenue loss upon competitor 's entry into the market in absence of preliminary_injunction ;

balance of hardships favored preliminary_injunction ; and

public interest supported grant of preliminary_injunction

Affirmed

Gajarsa Circuit_Judge filed dissenting opinion

NEWMAN Circuit_Judge
This appeal is from the grant of a preliminary_injunction pending final resolution of the several challenges raised by Sandoz Inc. to the validity enforceability and infringement of the Abbott_Laboratories_patents in suit.1 We conclude that abuse of discretion has not been shown in the district_court 's decision to grant the injunction pendente lite
That decision is affirmed

BACKGROUND
This suit concerns two Abbott_Laboratories_patents on extended_release_formulations of the antibiotic drug clarithromycin sold by Abbott with the brand name BiaxinTHE_RXL
The patent on clarithromycin itself expired in 2005 ; only extended_release_formulations are at issue
The purpose of the extended_release_formulation is to extend the period of drug effectiveness after ingestion and thereby to reduce the requisite frequency of dosage
Sandoz filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application ( ANDA ) for its extended_release_formulation of clarithromycin ; the Food and Drug Administration approved the ANDA on August 25 2005 and on September 16 2005 Abbott filed suit in the United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of Illinois charging Sandoz with infringement of United States Patent_No._6010,718 ( the ¡¬718_patent ) and Patent_No._6551,616 ( the ¡¬616_patent )
Abbott also charged infringement *1344 of Patent_No._6872,407 but has withdrawn this patent from suit

The ¡¬718_patent claims an extended_release_pharmaceutical_composition comprising an erythromycin_derivative and a pharmaceutically acceptable_polymer whereby after ingestion certain specified parameters of drug bioavailability are met
Claims 1 4 and 6 of the ¡¬718_patent are in suit : 1
A pharmaceutical_composition for extended_release of an erythromycin_derivative in the gastrointestinal_environment comprising an erythromycin_derivative and from about 5 to about 50 % by weight of a pharmaceutically acceptable_polymer so that when ingested orally the composition induces statistically significantly lower mean fluctuation index in the plasma than an immediate_release_composition of the erythromycin_derivative while maintaining bioavailability substantially equivalent to that of the immediate_release_composition of the erythromycin_derivative
4
A pharmaceutical_composition for extended_release of an erythromycin_derivative in the gastrointestinal_environment comprising an erythromycin_derivative and from about 5 to about 50 % by weight of a pharmaceutically acceptable_polymer so that upon oral ingestion maximum peak concentrations of the erythromycin_derivative are lower than those produced by an immediate_release_pharmaceutical_composition and area under the concentration-time curve and the minimum plasma concentrations are substantially equivalent to that of the immediate_release_pharmaceutical_composition
6
An extended_release_pharmaceutical_composition comprising an erythromycin_derivative and a pharmaceutically acceptable_polymer the composition having an improved taste profile as compared to the immediate release formulation
The ¡¬616_patent is a continuation-in-part of the ¡¬718_patent with claims directed to the method of reducing gastrointestinal side effects
Claim 2 is in suit shown with claim 1 from which it depends : 1
A method of reducing gastrointestinal adverse side effects comprising administering an effective amount of extended_release_pharmaceutical_composition comprising an erythromycin_derivative and a pharmaceutically acceptable_polymer
2
The method according to claim 1 wherein the erythromycin_derivative is clarithromycin
In response to the charge of infringement Sandoz presented the defenses of invalidity based on anticipation and obviousness unenforceability based on inequitable_conduct and noninfringement
This appeal is from the district_court 's grant of Abbott 's motion for a preliminary_injunction preserving the status quo during the pendency of this litigation
Sandoz challenges the district_court 's rulings on all issues
