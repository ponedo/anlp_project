Visual_Memory LLC appeals the district_court 's dismissal of its patent infringement complaint against NVIDIA Corporation
The district_court held that Visual_Memory 's U.S. Patent No._5953,740 is drawn to patent-ineligible_subject_matter and therefore its complaint failed to state a claim under Federal_Rule of Civil_Procedure 12 ( b ) ( 6 )
We conclude instead that the '740_patent claims an improvement to computer_memory_systems and is not directed to an abstract_idea
Accordingly we reverse the district_court and remand for further proceedings

I
The '740_patent teaches that computer systems frequently use a three-tiered memory_hierarchy to enhance performance
The three tiers include : 1 ) a low-cost low-speed_memory such as a magnetic disk for bulk storage of data ; 2 ) a medium-speed_memory that serves as the main_memory ; and 3 ) an expensive high-speed_memory that acts as a processor cache memory
'740_patent col. 1_ll._54 -64
Because the cache memory is the most expensive it is typically smaller than the main_memory and can not always store all the data required by the processor
The memory_hierarchy alleviates the limitations imposed by the cache 's size because it allows code and non-code data1 to be transferred from the main_memory to the cache during operation to ensure that the currently executing program has quick access to the required data
Replacement algorithms determine which data should be transferred from the main_memory to the cache and which data in the cache should be replaced
As a result the code and non-code data to be executed by the processor are continually grouped into the cache thereby facilitating rapid access for the currently executing program

These prior art memory_systems lacked versatility because they were designed and optimized based on the specific type of processor selected for use in that system
Designing a different memory_system for every processor_type is expensive and substituting any other type of processor into the system would decrease its efficiency
Memory systems could be designed to operate with multiple types of processors but the design tradeoffs often diminished the performance of one or all of the computers

The '740_patent purports to overcome these deficiencies by creating a memory_system with programmable_operational_characteristics that can be tailored for use with multiple different processors without the accompanying reduction in performance
It discloses a main_memory 12 and three separate caches : internal_cache 16 pre-fetch cache 18 and write buffer_cache 20
Id.at_col. 3_ll._34 -53
A schematic of the '740_patent 's memory_system is shown below in Figure 1 :

*1256. ?
The three caches possess programmable_operational_characteristics that are programmable based on the type of processor connected to the memory_system
When the system is turned on information about the type of processor is used to self-configure the programmable_operational_characteristics
For example depending on the type of processor internal_cache 16 can store both code and non-code data or it can store only code data
Id.at_col. 4_ll._30 -35
Similarly write buffer_cache 20 can be programmed to buffer data `` solely from a bus_master other than the system_processor '' or to buffer `` data writes by any bus_master including the system_processor ''
Id.at_col. 4_ll._35 -43
By separating the functionality for the caches and defining those functions based on the type of processor the patented system can `` achieve or exceed the performance of a system utilizing a cache many times larger than the cumulative size of the subject caches ''
Id.at_col. 4_ll._24 -26

Using a programmable_operational_characteristic based on the processor_type can also improve the main_memory
Fast page mode is a well-known technique for speeding up access to main_memory
In fast_page_mode a row in a memory page is accessed without having to continually re-specify the row address thereby reducing access time
A register associated with the main_memory holds the page address of the most recently accessed page
The '740_patent 's main_memory constitutes an advance over the prior art fast_page_mode memory because it is divided into pages containing either code or non-code data and `` the system provides a bias towards code pages or non-code pages depending upon the type of processor connected to the system ''
Id.at_col. 4_ll._55 -58
For one processor_type the register will hold the address of the most recently accessed code page ; for another processor_type the register will hold the address of the most recently accessed non-code page
The specification discloses that combining the selective open page bias with the fast_page_mode offers faster access to main_memory and increases system performance
Id.at_col. 5_ll._6 -8

Taken together the `` multiple mode operation '' of the '740_patent confers a substantial advantage by `` allow [ ing ] different types of processors to be installed with the [ same ] subject memory_system without *1257 significantly compromising their individual performance ''
Id.at_col. 5_ll._25 -29
The '740_patent 's claims reflect these technological improvements
For example claim 1 recites : 1
A computer_memory_system connectable to a processor and having one or more programmable_operational_characteristics said characteristics being defined through configuration by said computer based on the type of said processor wherein said system is connectable to said processor by a bus said system comprising : a main_memory connected to said bus ; and
a cache connected to said bus ; wherein a programmable_operational_characteristic of said system determines a type of data stored by said cache
Id.at_col. 6_ll._28 -38
The dependent claims further define the programmable_operational_characteristic i.e. determining whether the cache stores both code and non-code data ( claim 2 ) and whether the cache buffers data from both the bus_master and the processor ( claim 3 )
Independent claim 6 recites the fast_page_mode embodiment

Visual_Memory sued NVIDIA for infringement of the '740_patent
Believing the claims to be directed to patent-ineligible_subject_matter NVIDIA filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to Federal_Rule of Civil_Procedure 12 ( b ) ( 6 )

The district_court granted NVIDIA 's motion
Under step one of the Alice test the court concluded that the claims were directed to the `` abstract_idea of categorical_data_storage '' which humans have practiced for many years
Visual_Memory LLC v. NVIDIA Corp. No._1 5-789 2016_WL_3041847 at *4 ( D. Del
May_27,_2016 )
The court 's step-two analysis found no inventive_concept because the claimed computer components-a main_memory cache bus and processor-were generic and conventional
The '740_patent 's programmable_operational_characteristics did not provide the inventive_concept according to the court because they represent generic concepts that determine the type of data to be stored by the cache and the patent fails to explain the mechanism for accomplishing the result
Id.at *7

Visual_Memory appeals the district_court 's decision
We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
