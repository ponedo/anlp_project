BACKGROUND
A
The Claimed and Accused Processes
The '941_patent is directed to processes for creating low-cost ornamental_concrete_surfaces
The written description discloses for example that the claimed processes can be used to create an imitation brick surface on a concrete substrate at considerably lower cost than inlaying actual bricks into that substrate
See '941_patent col._1,_ll._52-58
Claim 6 the only claim at issue depends from independent claim 5 and claims the following process : 5
A process for coating a substrate with a decorative surface comprising mixing a first_batch of liquid_mortar consisting of a mixture of cement sand and an aqueous_solution of adhesive_resin and applying a first_layer of said liquid_mortar to said surface ; allowing said first_layer to cure ; providing a flexible template panel having a pattern of desired grout lines an adhesive_layer and a backing layer ; removing said backing layer to expose said adhesive_layer ; securing said template to said first_layer ; mixing a second_batch of cement sand and an aqueous_solution of adhesive_resin including also a color pigment contrasting with the color of said first_batch ; applying a second_layer of said second_batch of liquid_mortar over said first_layer and said template and allowing said second_layer to fully dry ; removing said template with any part of said second_layer immediately above said template and allowing said second_layer to finish curing ; and
applying a coat of concrete sealer material over said first and second mortar layers
6
A process as claimed in claim 5 wherein said flexible template is of heavy wax impregnated paper with adhesive backing
