* Opinion
PROST Circuit_Judge
This is a patent infringement case under the Hatch-Waxman Act Apotex Inc. and Apotex_Corp. ( collectively `` Apotex '' ) appeal the grant of summary_judgment by the United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of California that the patent held by Roche Palo Alto LLC and Allergan Inc. ( collectively `` Roche '' ) is valid and infringed by the formulation covered by Apotex 's abbreviated new drug application ( `` ANDA '' )
Roche Palo Alto LLC v. Apotex Inc. 526_F.Supp.2d_985 ( N.D.Cal.2007 )
Because we find no error in the court 's holding that the reverse_doctrine of equivalents is inapplicable and that claim preclusion prohibits Apotex from raising other validity challenges we affirm

I
A. Roche is the owner of U.S. Patent No._5110,493 ( `` the ¡¬493_patent `` ) which is directed to a drug formulation for treatment of eye inflammation such as that caused by glaucoma conjunctivitis eye surgery or eye injury
¡¬ 493 patent col._1,_ll._14-28
The formulation contains a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( `` NSAID '' ) such as ketorolac tromethamine ( `` KT '' ) ; a quaternary_ammonium_preservative such as benzalkonium chloride ( `` BAC '' ) ; and the nonionic surfactant octoxynol 40 ( `` O40 '' )
Id. col._3,_ll._13-19 col._4,_ll._20-41
Claim 1 is representative : *1375 An opthalmologically acceptable non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug formulation comprising : an opthamologically acceptable non-steroidal anti-inflammatory carboxyl group-containing drug in an effective_amount for ophthalmic treatment between 0.001 % and 10.00 %_wt/vol ; a quaternary_ammonium_preservative in an antimicrobially effective_amount between 0.001 % and 1.0 %_wt/vol ; an ethoxylated alkyl phenol that conforms generally to the formula : C8 H17C6H4 ( OCH2-CH2 ) n OH where n has an average value of 40 [ O40 ] in a stabilizing amount between 0.001 % and 1.0 %_wt/vol ; and an aqueous vehicle q.s
to 100 %
Dependent claim 7 further includes sodium chloride ( `` NaCl '' ) at a concentration of 0.79 %_wt/vol

The last limitation in claim 1 requiring the presence of O40 was added in response to the examiner 's obviousness rejection over several prior art references
Accompanying the claim amendment the applicants submitted the Lidgate Declaration which stated that O40 produced unexpected_results over other nonionic surfactants such as O3 and O5
Specifically the declaration stated that O40 produced a clear solution while the others did not
The examiner allowed the claims based on the unexpected_results of O40

Over the years Apotex filed two different ANDAs on two different generic drug formulations each containing a paragraph IV certification that the ¡¬493_patent is invalid unenforceable or will not be infringed by the generic_version of the drug
In 2001 Apotex filed its first ANDA ( `` ANDA-1 '' ) directed to a generic_version of Roche 's ACULARTHE_R
Subsequently in 2005 Apotex filed its second ANDA ( `` ANDA-2 '' ) directed to a generic_version of Roche 's ACULARTHE_RLS
The two formulations differ in their compositions as follows :
