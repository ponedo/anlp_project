No._86-1692 holding appellants liable for infringement of appellee 's patents and breach of contract and enjoining them from further_infringement of the patents
We affirm

BACKGROUND
On May_17,_1977 U.S._Patent 4,024,535 was granted to Harold_Goldstein on a sound generator for a sound masking system
Goldstein assigned the patent to Acoustical Design Inc. ( ADI )
U.S._Patent 4,185,167 was granted on January 22 1980 to Donald R. Cunningham and James E. Sulewsky for a sound masking package
ADI also became the assignee of that patent
The inventions are for the purpose of masking disturbing background noise and permitting alternation between predetermined sound spectra

ADI and Control had earlier agreed in 1976 that Control would be the exclusive manufacturer of the `` Noise-Mask '' product_line products covered by the two patents and that ADI would have exclusive rights to market the product_line
Control thus became a licensee of ADI
In 1982 ADI and Control further contracted that ADI would serve as Control 's non-exclusive sales representative for sound masking devices ceiling acoustical panels acoustical banners baffles and related products
ADI and Control maintained this business relationship until late 1985 when as a result of Control 's failure to pay ADI commissions allegedly due to ADI under the 1982 agreement the 1976_and_1982 agreements were terminated by ADI
Control continued to manufacture and sell the same sound masking devices it was previously licensed to manufacture notwithstanding the termination of the agreements

Accordingly on May_20,_1986 ADI filed suit for patent_infringement and breach of contract in the United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of New_York against appellants
The latter denied infringement and claimed that ADI 's patents were invalid for lack of novelty obviousness and incorrect inventorship
ADI *941 moved for summary judgment as to the '535_patent based on the doctrine of assignor_estoppel on the theory that Goldstein who was a defendant principal of the corporate defendants and in privity with Leonard was the inventor named in the patent and therefore could not challenge the patent 's validity
The district_court denied the motion on the ground that a triable issue of fact existed

In January 1990 the lawsuit was tried for seven days before a jury
Appellants attempted to invalidate the patents on the basis of lack of novelty in view of two items of alleged prior_art : U.S._Patent 4,059,726 issued to Watters and public use of an electrical circuit developed and manufactured by Radio Speakers of Canada Inc. ( the RSC circuit )
At the close of all the evidence appellants did not move for a directed verdict nor did they object to any instruction to the jury related to an issue now on appeal

The court submitted to the jury a special verdict form which contained questions relating to the issues in the case
The jury provided answers in appellee 's favor to each of these interrogatories
Appellants did not move for judgment notwithstanding the verdict ( JNOV ) or for a new_trial
On March 10th the court granted appellee 's renewed motion for an order finding that the doctrine of assignor_estoppel should have precluded appellants from attacking at trial the validity of the '535_patent
The court subsequently entered final judgment for appellee and this appeal followed
