I
BACKGROUND
A
The claimed invention involved in this case relates to a flexible track upon which toy cars run
Mattel 's 'Hot_Wheels ' the first major commercialization of such a toy became one of the most commercially successful toys in history

Lemelson 's original patent application for a `` Toy_Track '' was filed in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ( PTO ) on May_14,_1967 with one independent_claim and eight dependent_claims
That original independent_claim reproduced below consisted of what would later become the first five of the seven clauses in claim 3 of the reissue patent2 :

A trackway toy comprising in combination with a toy_vehicle having plural_wheels ( a ) a trackway including a base having an upper_surface along which said vehicle may travel ( b ) guide_means for defining a path of travel for said vehicle on said upper_surface ( c ) said guide_means including at least one formation molded integral with said upper_surface of said trackway and providing plural_parallel extending surfaces against which respective_wheels of said vehicle may ride to define said path in travel_therealong ( d ) said base and said guide_means being integrally molded of flexible_plastic_material and having the characteristic such that said base is normally incapable of self-support whereby said trackway will easily conform to non-planar surfaces and
( e ) rigid_support_means for said trackway disposed adjacent said base and engaging a surface thereof in a manner to predetermine the shape of the base
During prosecution of the 1967 application Lemelson 's counsel cited to the PTO several patents found in a prior art search including the Gardiol patent U.S. Patent No._2862,333
Lemelson 's counsel described Gardiol as a track construction which includes internal wires to maintain its desired shape while Lemelson 's application was said to be directed to a flexible plastic track which was `` normally incapable of self-support so that the trackway could be made to readily conform to non-planar surfaces ''

The Examiner rejected independent_claim 1 and three of its dependent_claims as being anticipated by Gardiol
The remaining five dependent_claims which added further limitations were allowed subject to being written in independent_form
Subsequent to a personal interview with the Examiner Lemelson 's counsel filed an amendment which re-wrote the allowed claims in independent_form and cancelled the rejected claims

The application was later allowed and issued as U.S. Patent No._3451,161 ( the '161_patent ) on June_24,_1969
The patent `` Toy_Track and Vehicle Therefor '' is directed to a `` toy guideway or track and vehicle for riding thereover ''
Claim 3 of the '161_patent as rewritten which is the same as claim 3 of the reissue patent3 reads :

3
A trackway [ toy ] comprising in combination with a toy_vehicle having plural_wheels [ a ] a trackway including a base having an upper_surface along which said vehicle may travel [ b ] guide_means for defining a path of travel for said vehicle on said upper_surface [ c ] said guide_means including at least one formation molded integrally with said upper_surface of said trackway *1204 and providing plural_parallel extending surfaces against which respective_wheels of said vehicle may ride to define said path of travel_therealong [ d ] said base and said guide_means being integrally molded of flexible_plastic_material and having the characteristic such that said base is normally incapable of self-support whereby said trackway will easily conform to non-planar surfaces and
[ e ] rigid_support_means for said trackway disposed adjacent said base and engaging a surface thereof in a manner to predetermine the shape of the base [ f ] said guide_means include a pair of spaced apart_runner_portions for defining the pathway of a vehicle moving over said track [ g ] said spaced apart_runner_portions include upwardly extending rails for guiding the wheels of a vehicle
( The bracketed lettering before each clause has been added for convenience in referencing )
A comparison of original cancelled claim 1 and what is now reissue claim 3 shows that the first five clauses- [ a ] through [ e ] -of original cancelled claim 1 are identical to the first five clauses of reissue claim 3
As we shall discuss it was the addition of the final two clauses- [ f ] and [ g ] -that overcame the problem of anticipation by Gardiol and upon the meaning of which this case turns
