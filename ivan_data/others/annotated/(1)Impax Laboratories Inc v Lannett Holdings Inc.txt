v. LANNETT HOLDINGS INC. Lannett Company Inc. Defendants-Appellants
2017-2020
| Decided : June_28,_2018
Synopsis
Background : Assignee assignor and exclusive_licensee brought action alleging infringement of patents directed to nasal formulation for drug used to treat migraines after alleged infringers filed Abbreviated_New_Drug_Application ( ANDA )
Alleged infringers stipulated to infringement but challenged plaintiffs ' standing to bring suit and validity of patents
The United_States_District_Court for the District of Delaware Nos._1 :14-cv-00984-RGA 1:14-cv-00999-RGA Richard G. Andrews J. 2015_WL_7737309 construed the claims and held after bench_trial that patents were not invalid as anticipated or obvious 246_F.Supp.3d_1024
Infringers appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Lourie Circuit_Judge held that :

district_court did not clearly err in finding that skilled_artisan would have looked to any other triptan before looking to zolmitriptan to develop pharmaceutical product that would not take advantage of first pass metabolism ;

district_court in its analysis of secondary considerations did not clearly err in finding that licensing agreement was at least in part attributable to patents ; and

patents were not obvious based on prior_art that mentioned zolmitriptan in connection with nasal formulations and sprays

Affirmed

For the reasons that follow we affirm

BACKGROUND
Triptans are selective serotonin receptor agonists developed in the early 1980s
The first triptan to be marketed was sumatriptan under the name ImitrexTHE_R which first became available in the U.S. in an injection form in 1993
In 1995 sumatriptan became available in an oral_tablet_form and later in 1997 in an intranasal form as ImitrexTHE_R ( sumatriptan ) Nasal_Spray ( `` NS '' )
Zolmitriptan is another triptan which first became available in the U.S. in an oral_tablet_form in 1999 under the name ZomigTHE_R
At that time there were several other triptans that were either on the market or under development

AstraZeneca owns and Impax is the exclusive_licensee of the '237 and '767_patent s,1 which relate to formulations of zolmitriptan for intranasal_administration
The claims at issue in this appeal are directed to pharmaceutical_formulations intranasal_administration devices or aqueous solutions of zolmitriptan
'237_patent col. 5_l._4 -col. 6_l._22 ; '767_patent col. 5_l._8 -col. 6_l._25

Claim 4 of the '237_patent depends from claim 2 which in turn depends from claim 1
Claims 1 2 and 4 of the '237_patent read as follows : 1
A pharmaceutical_formulation suitable for intranasal_administration which comprises zolmitriptan and a pharmaceutically acceptable_carrier wherein the pH of the formulation is in the range 4.BIG_TOKEN__5_to_5__BIG_TOKEN5
2
A pharmaceutical_formulation according to claim 1 wherein the pH of the formulation is 5
4
A pharmaceutical_formulation according to claim 2 wherein the formulation is buffered
'237_patent col. 5_ll._4 -9 12-13

Similarly claims 6_and_15 of the '767_patent read : 6
A pharmaceutical_formulation suitable for intranasal_administration which comprises zolmitriptan and a pharmaceutically acceptable_carrier wherein the pH of the formulation is in the range 3.BIG_TOKEN__5_to_5__BIG_TOKEN5 wherein the formulation is buffered by a mixture of citric acid and disodium_phosphate
15
An aqueous solution of zolmitriptan in a buffer at a pH of less than 6.0
'767_patent col. 5_ll._23 -27 col. 6_ll._21 -22

Other formulation claims of the '237 and '767_patent s at issue include similar limitations with regard to pH ranges and buffering and some formulation claims include additional_limitations relating to sterility
*1376 '237_patent col. 5_l._4 -col. 6_l._22 ; '767_patent col. 5_l._8 -col. 6_l._25
These additional_limitations are not at issue on appeal

AstraZeneca owns the New Drug Application ( `` NDA '' ) for ZomigTHE_R ( zolmitriptan ) Nasal_Spray 2.5 mg/spray and 5 mg/spray approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( `` FDA '' ) for treatment of migraine
The '237 and '767_patent s are listed in connection with ZomigTHE_R_Nasal_Spray in the FDA 's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations commonly known as the `` Orange Book ''

In 2012 AstraZeneca and Impax entered into an agreement for distribution license development and supply of the ZomigTHE_R_products
The agreement granted to Impax an exclusive license to AstraZeneca 's patents covering the ZomigTHE_R_products including the '237 and '767_patent s in return for the payment of $ 130 million and additional payments at varying royalty rates including 40 % on the nasal spray
Opinion 246 F.Supp.3d at 1039 ; J.A
2204-05

In June 2014 Lannett notified AstraZeneca that it had filed an Abbreviated_New_Drug_Application ( `` ANDA '' ) seeking approval for a generic version of ZomigTHE_R_Nasal_Spray making a certification according to 21 U.S.C.¡± 355 ( j ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ( vii ) ( IV ) ( `` Paragraph IV certification '' ) alleging noninfringement and/or invalidity of the '237 and '767_patent s

In July 2014 Appellees filed suit against Lannett in the District of Delaware for infringement of the '237 and '767_patent s pursuant to 35 U.S.C.¡± 271 ( e ) ( 2 ) ( A )
In December 2015 the district_court issued its claim construction opinion and order
The court agreed with Appellees that the preamble of `` [ a ] pharmaceutical_formulation suitable for intranasal_administration '' is limiting

Dec._8,_2017 ) ECF No._64 ( `` Claim Construction Order '' ) ; J.A
9-10
The court also adopted Appellees ' construction of `` zolmitriptan '' as meaning its chemical name and structure declining to adopt Lannett 's proposed construction that would include `` ionic and covalently bonded forms thereof that preserve the pharmaceutical activity of the structure ''

The court however agreed with Lannett regarding the construction of the word `` buffer '' adopting the `` functional definition '' proposed by Lannett id.at *4-7 ; J.A
9 and adopted the parties ' agreed-upon constructions of `` disodium_phosphate '' and `` pH of the formulation is 5 '' J.A

In September 2016 a four-day bench_trial was held on the issues of infringement and validity
Following the bench_trial the parties stipulated that Lannett 's product described in its ANDA with a target pH of 5 if approved by the FDA will infringe the '237 and '767_patent s. Impax_Labs Inc. v. Lannett_Holdings_Inc. No._1 :14-cv-00984-RGA ( D._Del
Sept._29,_2016 ) ECF_No._1 37

In March 2017 the district_court issued its decision on validity holding that Lannett failed to prove by clear and convincing_evidence that the asserted claims were invalid
Opinion 246 F.Supp.3d at 1030
The court first made factual findings on the teachings of the prior_art references namely sumatriptan NS International Publication No
WO 99/64044 ( `` Marquess '' ) U.S._Patent 6,326,401 and its counterpart French Publication No
FR 2773489 ( together `` Chauveau '' )2 and Stewart Tepper & Alan Rapoport The Triptans : A Summary 12 ( 5 ) CNS Drugs *1377 403-417 ( Nov. 1999 ) ( `` Tepper & Rapoport '' )
Id.at 1032-34

The district_court then determined that Lannett failed to prove that claim 4 of the '237_patent and claim 15 of the '767_patent were anticipated by Marquess or Chauveau as neither of the references disclosed all the limitations of the claims
Id.at 1034-35
The court also determined that Lannett failed to prove by clear and convincing_evidence that the claims at issue would have been obvious over the prior_art
Id.at 1035-44
In reaching the nonobviousness conclusion the court found that : ( 1 ) the prior_art including Chauveau taught away from formulating zolmitriptan for intranasal_administration because zolmitriptan was known to be active not by itself but through its more potent_metabolite 183C91 ; ( 2 ) the prior_art at the time failed to teach that zolmitriptan by itself as contrasted with its metabolite would have been effective ; and ( 3 ) a skilled_artisan would not have been motivated to make with a reasonable expectation of success nasal formulations of zolmitriptan
Id.at 1036-39 ; see also id.at 1032 n.3
The court also found that sumatriptan does not have an active metabolite and that `` [ o ] nly two other triptans eletriptan and almotriptan have active metabolites but their metabolites 'do n't really contribute at all to the efficacy of those drugs '
Zolmitriptan stands alone in the class of triptans as having an active more potent_metabolite ''
Id.at 1033 ( quoting Appellees ' expert Dr. Alan Rapoport ) ( citation omitted )

The district_court also considered evidence of objective indicia of nonobviousness
Id.at 1039-43
It found that the 2012 agreement between Impax and AstraZeneca supported a showing of nonobviousness but found any further secondary considerations evidence inconclusive
Id
Ultimately after noting that `` [ t ] he question of obviousness is a close one '' the court determined that Lannett had failed to meet its burden of proving invalidity by clear and convincing_evidence
Id.at 1043-44
Following the decision on the issue of validity the court entered final judgment and an injunction in favor of Appellees

Lannett timely appealed
