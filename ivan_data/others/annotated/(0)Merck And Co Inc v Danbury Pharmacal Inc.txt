BACKGROUND
Presuming familiarity with Chief_Judge Schwartz ' comprehensive opinion we describe here only the basic procedural facts and those particularly relevant to Merck 's arguments on appeal

Merck 's '246_patent claims a method of using cyclobenzaprine to treat certain types of skeletal muscle disorders
The '246_patent is the result of four applications : a July_7,_1970 Canadian application ; a May_21,_1971 United States application that was rejected amended and finally *1419 abandoned ; a January 31 1973 continuation-in-part ( c-i-p ) application that was rejected amended and discussed in an interview at which claims 1-5 were indicated as allowable ; and an April_9,_1974 c-i-p application in which those claims were again allowed
On May_6,_1975 the '246_patent issued

Applying in September 1970 for Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) approval to sell cyclobenzaprine for use as set forth in the patent Merck had submitted to FDA an Investigational New Drug application that contained studies of cyclobenzaprine and amitriptyline as muscle relaxants
Cyclobenzaprine 's selectivity was emphasized.1 In July 1973 Merck had submitted to FDA a report compiling summarizing and evaluating its cyclobenzaprine research and noting that the predominant side effect was drowsiness

In December 1975 Merck submitted to FDA a New Drug Application ( NDA ) seeking approval to sell cyclobenzaprine as a skeletal muscle relaxant
Merck 's NDA submissions were consistent with the earlier submissions and referred to cyclobenzaprine 's `` propensity for inducing drowsiness ''
The FDA approved Merck 's sale of cyclobenzaprine as `` an adjunct to rest and physical therapy for relief of muscle spasm associated with acute painful musculoskeletal conditions ''
The package insert cited drowsiness as the most frequent side effect

On October 31 1986 Danbury Pharmacal Inc. ( Danbury ) filed an abbreviated new drug application seeking FDA approval to sell a generic version of cyclobenzaprine for the same purpose
See 35 U.S.C.¡± 271 ( e ) ( 2 ) ( Supp
IV 1987 )
On December 17 1986 Merck sued Danbury for infringement
