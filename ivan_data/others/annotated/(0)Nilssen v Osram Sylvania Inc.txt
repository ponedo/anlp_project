* Synopsis
Background : Inventor and exclusive_licensee brought action against competitor alleging infringement of patents relating to compact fluorescent_light_bulbs and to ballasts for gas_discharge_lamps such as fluorescent_light_bulbs
The United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of Illinois John W. Darrah J. 440_F.Supp.2d_884 held that patents were unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct
Plaintiffs appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Lourie Circuit_Judge held that :

inventor engaged in inequitable_conduct by submitting affidavits in support of patentability including points of distinction over prior_art patents without informing examiner of affiant 's relationship to inventor ;

district_court did not abuse its discretion by holding that patents were unenforceable prior to determining whether inequitable_conduct related to each of those patents could have rendered additional related patents unenforceable as well ;

invention had been licensed to large entity and thus inventor was not eligible for small_entity_maintenance_fees on patents covered by agreement ;

district_court did not abuse its discretion in finding clear and convincing evidence of inventor 's obvious intent to mislead Patent and Trademark_Office ( PTO ) in improperly claiming small entity status with regard to maintenance fees and that inventor 's exculpability statements were not credible ;

district_court 's finding that inventor made intentional misrepresentations in claiming that his patents were derived from earlier ones was not clearly erroneous ;

inventor engaged in inequitable_conduct by not disclosing prior litigation against other competitor in prosecution of patents ; and

inference was not unreasonable that inventor intended to deceive PTO during prosecution by withholding prior_art references

Affirmed

Before MAYER and LOURIE Circuit_Judges and LINARES District Judge
** Opinion
LOURIE Circuit_Judge
Ole K. Nilssen and the Geo_Foundation Ltd. ( collectively `` appellants '' ) appeal from the judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of Illinois in favor of Osram Sylvania Inc. and Osram_Sylvania_Products Inc. ( collectively `` Osram '' ) holding fifteen patents issued to Nilssen and exclusively licensed to the Geo_Foundation unenforceable for inequitable_conduct
Because the district_court did not abuse its discretion we affirm the court 's entry of judgment of unenforceability

BACKGROUND
Nilssen is the inventor on a large number of patents related to electrical lighting products
At issue in this appeal are fifteen of his patents the first eleven allegedly infringed by Osram and the last four withdrawn shortly before trial : U.S
Patents 4,857,806 ( `` the ¡¬806_patent `` ) ; 5,164,637 ( `` the ¡¬637_patent `` ) ; 5,233,270 ( `` the ¡¬270_patent `` ) ; 5,343,123 ( `` the ¡¬ 123 patent '' ) ; 5,402,043 ( `` the ¡¬043_patent `` ) ; 5,416,386 ( `` the ¡¬386_patent `` ) ; 5,432,409 ( `` the ¡¬409_patent `` ) ; 5,479,074 ( `` the ¡¬074_patent `` ) ; 5,481,160 ( `` the ¡¬160_patent `` ) ; 5,510,680 ( `` the ¡¬680_patent `` ) ; and 5,510,681 ( `` the ¡¬681_patent `` ) ( collectively the `` patents in suit '' ) ; and 4,677,345 ( `` the ¡¬345_patent `` ) ; 5,047,690 ( `` the ¡¬690_patent `` ) ; 5,189,342 ( `` the ¡¬342_patent `` ) ; and 5,341,067 ( `` the ¡¬067_patent `` )
The patents relate to compact fluorescent_light_bulbs and to ballasts for gas_discharge_lamps such as fluorescent_light_bulbs
A ballast converts the low frequency alternating current_power provided by a utility to high frequency alternating current_power necessary for the operation of gas_discharge_lamps

After initially relying on attorneys to prosecute his patents in 1983 Nilssen began prosecuting his own patent applications including those resulting in the patents in suit because he felt that his *1227 understanding of the subject matter was better than that of any attorney
Nilssen was sufficiently knowledgeable of patent law and practice to cite the Manual of Patent Examining Procedure ( `` MPEP '' ) patent statutes and regulations and case law during prosecution of his patent applications

Nilssen established the Geo_Foundation as a not-for-profit charitable organization in the Cayman Islands in 1998
Since June 2000 the Geo_Foundation has been the exclusive_licensee of Nilssen 's patents
Prior to that date Nilssen licensed at least some of the patents in suit directly to Philips Electronics North America Corp. ( `` Philips '' )
Apparently that license was canceled or revoked and Geo began sublicensing those patents to Philips following the execution of its exclusive license agreement with Nilssen
The Geo_Foundation receives all licensing revenue from the patents and any damages awards or settlements resulting from lawsuits to enforce the patents
It pays all litigation costs associated with those lawsuits and it pays Nilssen twenty-five percent of its gross income

Appellants sued Osram in 2000 alleging that electronic_ballasts manufactured and sold by Osram infringed eleven of Nilssen 's patents
Among the defenses asserted by Osram was that Nilssen had engaged in inequitable_conduct in the procurement of the patents
The district_court held a six-day bench trial on Osram 's inequitable_conduct defenses

First the court determined that Nilssen 's submission of two affidavits from Dale Fiene one during reexamination of the ¡¬345_patent and one during examination of the application that led to the ¡¬690_patent in support of the patentability of claims rejected by the examiner constituted inequitable_conduct because the affidavits failed to disclose Fiene 's personal and professional association with Nilssen and Fiene 's financial interest in Nilssen 's patents
However the court found that the reference to the ¡¬345_patent in the description of the prior_art in the ¡¬270 and ¡¬681_patent s and the fact that the three patents share a common parent application did not demonstrate sufficient relatedness among the three patents for the inequitable_conduct during prosecution of the ¡¬345_patent to also render the ¡¬270 and ¡¬ 681 patents unenforceable under what the court referred to as the `` doctrine of infectious_unenforceability ''

Second the district_court considered whether Nilssen 's incorrect payment of small_entity_maintenance_fees for the patents in suit constituted inequitable_conduct
Nilssen entered into a Compact Fluorescent Lamp Agreement ( the `` CFLA '' ) with Philips effective December 7 1995
The CFLA provided as follows ( emphasis added ) : Nilssen expects to offer CFL manufacturers a preferential running royalty rate under his CFL_patents for a limited time period starting the first quarter of 1996
Nilssen and Philips agree that Nilssen will offer and Philips will take a standard license from Nilssen under his CFL_patents at the preferential rate provided that no royalties or payments will accrue under such license until Nilssen has licensed one CFL competitor having at least 10 % Dollar share of the U.S. market for CFL 's
The court found that the CFLA covered the ¡¬806 ¡¬637 ¡¬270 ¡¬123 ¡¬680 and ¡¬ 681 patents
Nilssen also entered into a Patent License Agreement ( `` PLA '' ) with Philips effective January 1 1996
The court found that the PLA covered the ¡¬806 ¡¬637 ¡¬043 ¡¬386 ¡¬409 ¡¬074 ¡¬160 ¡¬680 and ¡¬681_patent_s. Because the court found that these agreements created a license or an obligation to license all of the patents in *1228 suit and Philips had more than 500 employees at all relevant times the court concluded that Nilssen was obligated to pay large_entity_maintenance_fees on all the patents in suit after December 7 1995 the date of the CFLA
The court also found that Nilssen had made twenty-one improper small entity payments including at least one for each patent in suit compared with eight proper large entity payments
The court did not credit Nilssen 's explanation that he did not believe that large entity payments were required for the patents once they were licensed to the nonprofit Geo_Foundation in 2000
The court thus concluded that all of the patents in suit were unenforceable for inequitable_conduct in failing to pay large_entity_maintenance_fees

Third the court found that Nilssen had intentionally misclaimed an effective priority date of March_20,_1978 in the ¡¬637 ¡¬043 ¡¬386 ¡¬409 ¡¬ 160 ¡¬680 and ¡¬681_patent_s. The court found that the statutory copendency and/or cross-reference requirements were not satisfied for each of these patents
The court found the false claims material because they allowed Nilssen to potentially avoid prior_art
The court based its finding of intent in part on two letters Nilssen sent to a customer Advance Transformer Co. stating that it might be difficult to obtain effective patent protection for some parts of a new ballast design that might `` be considered as representing known art ''
The court thus concluded that the ¡¬637 ¡¬043 ¡¬386 ¡¬409 ¡¬160 ¡¬ 680 and ¡¬681_patent s were unenforceable for inequitable_conduct based upon the claims of false effective priority dates

Fourth the court considered whether Nilssen 's failure to disclose to the examiner ongoing_litigation with Motorola rendered some of the patents unenforceable
Nilssen filed a lawsuit against Motorola_alleging_infringement of six patents on October 19 1993
Motorola denied infringement claiming invalidity for anticipation obviousness and failure to observe the requirements of 35 U.S.C.¡± 112
Those claims were dismissed without prejudice on July_23,_1996
A new lawsuit was filed against Motorola_alleging_infringement of the same six patents plus nine additional Nilssen patents on September 3 1996
All of the patents involved in those suits pertained to the same general subject matter-electronic_ballasts-claimed in the patents in suit
The applications leading to the ¡¬123 ¡¬043 ¡¬386 ¡¬409 ¡¬074 ¡¬160 ¡¬ 680 and ¡¬681_patent s were pending during the time of the Motorola suits but Nilssen failed to inform the examiner of the litigation
The court found that Nilssen intended to mislead the United States Patent and Trademark_Office ( `` PTO '' ) and did not credit Nilssen 's testimony that he was unaware of the duty to disclose information concerning the ongoing_litigation to the PTO
The court thus concluded that the ¡¬123 ¡¬043 ¡¬386 ¡¬409 ¡¬074 ¡¬160 ¡¬680 and ¡¬681_patent s were unenforceable for inequitable_conduct for failing to report the existence of the Motorola litigation to the PTO

Fifth the court concluded that Nilssen had engaged in inequitable_conduct in the prosecution of the ¡¬342_patent and the ¡¬067_patent as well as the ¡¬ 806 ¡¬043 and ¡¬681_patent s by failing to identify to the PTO relevant prior_art of which he had knowledge
However the court found that the `` descendant relationship '' of the ¡¬123 ¡¬043 ¡¬386 ¡¬409 and ¡¬160_patent s to the ¡¬342_patent did not render them unenforceable through what it referred to as the `` doctrine of infectious_unenforceability ''

Finally the court rejected Osram 's argument that each of the patents in suit should be held unenforceable under the doctrine of unclean hands

*1229 Appellants timely appealed
We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
