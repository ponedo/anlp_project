United States Court of Appeals Federal Circuit
TRANSWEB LLC Plaintiff-Appellee
v. 3M INNOVATIVE PROPERTIES COMPANY 3M Company Defendants-Appellants
No._2014-1646
| Feb._10,_2016
Synopsis
Background : Competitor brought action against holder of patents for method of producing filtration membranes used in industrial respirators seeking declaratory_judgment of invalidity unenforceability and non-infringement and also asserting a Walker Process antitrust claim
The United States District Court for the District of New_Jersey Faith S. Hochberg J. 16_F.Supp.3d_385 entered judgment in favor of competitor and patent holder appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Hughes Circuit_Judge held that :

evidence established that samples of plasma-fluorinated filtration membrane given out at a trade show was a public_disclosure that invalidated the patents ;

evidence established that patentee engaged in inequitable_conduct in obtaining patents ;

evidence supported competitor 's antitrust claim ; and

attorney_fees incurred by competitor defending prior infringement suit were antitrust_injury and thus could form the basis for treble damages under the Clayton Act

Before WALLACH BRYSON and HUGHES Circuit_Judges
Opinion
HUGHES Circuit_Judge
3M sued TransWeb for infringement of several patents
TransWeb sued for declaratory_judgment of invalidity and non-infringement of the patents
A jury found the patents to be invalid based on TransWeb 's prior_public_use of the patented method
In accordance with an advisory verdict from the jury the district_court found the patents unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct
The jury also found 3M to be liable for a Walker_Process_antitrust_violation and that attorney_fees were an appropriate antitrust remedy
The district_court awarded approximately $ 26 million to TransWeb including trebled attorney_fees as antitrust_damages
The primary issues are whether sufficient corroborating evidence exists to support the finding of prior_public_use by TransWeb and whether the attorney_fees are an appropriate basis for damages under the antitrust laws in this context
We hold in the affirmative on both issues
For the latter issue we find that TransWeb 's attorney_fees appropriately flow from the unlawful aspect of 3M 's antitrust violation and thus are an antitrust_injury that can properly serve as the basis for antitrust_damages
For these reasons we affirm the district_court 's judgment

I. TransWeb and 3M are both manufacturers of filters for respirators such as might be worn by workers in a dirty or otherwise contaminated worksite
The filter_media at issue in this case consist of `` nonwoven_fibrous_webs '' which rely on a `` web '' of fibers rather than traditional woven material
Both TransWeb and 3M use a process of melting pellets of a filter_material such as polypropylene blowing the melted material into a thin film and then allowing the material to cool and solidify into the nonwoven_fibrous_web

It had been known in the art for some time that a filter_medium could be improved by imparting upon it an electrical_charge
In this way the filter_medium can repel or capture particulates both by mechanical and electromagnetic means
A filter_medium on which a semipermanent electrical_charge has been imparted is referred to as an `` electret ''

TransWeb and 3M independently developed a technique for imparting this electret characteristic by using plasma_fluorination
Fluorination involves introducing fluorine_atoms into the chemical_structure of the filter_web
Previously known techniques involved mixing fluorine_compounds *1300 into the melted filter_material but this proved disadvantageous
Instead TransWeb and 3M both discovered that it would be advantageous to first form the fibrous web and then introduce the fluorine_atoms into the chemical_structure
This technique involves exposing a gaseous fluorine compound to the surface of the filter_web in the presence of plasma
The intense heat and electromagnetic energy introduced by the plasma cause some of the chemical bonds on the surface of the filter_web to break and the fluorine_atoms fill in those bonds to form fluorine_compounds on the surface of the filter_web

Plasma-fluorinated filter_media are particularly effective in oily environments where other types of filter_media might perform poorly or quickly degrade
The National Institute for Occupational_Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) provides a rating and approval service for oily environment respirators categorizing them as : not resistant to oil ; resistant to oil ; or oil proof
The Occupational_Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) provides regulations governing what NIOSH rating of respirators must be used in certain types of worksites within the United States

The present appeal focuses largely on the events surrounding a filtration industry exposition that occurred in late April and early May of 1997
It is uncontested that TransWeb 's founder Kumar Ogale attended the expo and handed out samples of filter_material
The filter_material included samples of TransWeb 's `` T-Melt '' products an identifier for the general class of melt-blown i.e. nonwoven_fibrous_web media
The primary dispute is whether Mr._Ogale handed out more specifically samples of the `` T-Melt P '' products which is the specific class of plasma-fluorinated T-Melt products
Mr._Ogale testified at trial that he did in fact hand out T-Melt_P_samples at the expo though no independent documents or testimony evidence this fact
The parties do not contest that if Mr._Ogale handed out T-Melt_P_samples at the expo then they would serve as prior art to the plasma_fluorination technique of the claimed methods
The expo occurred more than one year prior to the priority date of the patents asserted in this case so any public_disclosure of plasma_fluorination at the expo would be a statutory bar to patentability at least based on that feature

In July of 1998 3M filed U.S. Patent Application 09/109,497 to which both of U.S
Patents 6,397 458_and_6808,551 claim earliest priority
3M asserted both the ¡¬458 and ¡¬551_patent s against TransWeb
In addition to the plasma_fluorination of nonwoven_fibrous_webs described above the patent family discloses use of `` hydro-charging '' which is a technique that uses water to impart the electrical_charge on the filter_medium

3M initially filed suit in Minnesota against TransWeb for patent infringement
After 3M voluntarily dismissed that suit due to an apparent personal jurisdiction issue TransWeb filed suit in New_Jersey for declaratory_judgment

The district_court in New_Jersey ultimately presented the following issues to a jury : infringement of claims 31_and_57 of the ¡¬458_patent ; invalidity for obviousness of claims 31_and_57 ; unenforceability of the ¡¬458 and ¡¬551_patent s due to inequitable_conduct ; Walker_Process_antitrust_violation based on fraudulent procurement and subsequent assertion of the ¡¬458 and ¡¬ 551 patents ; sham litigation antitrust violation based on assertion of the ¡¬458 and ¡¬551_patent s ; entitlement to lost profits damages for antitrust_violations ; and entitlement to attorney_fees as damages for antitrust_violations
The jury delivered the following verdicts : claims 31_and_57 are not infringed ; claims 31_and_57 are invalid ; both patents are unenforceable ; *1301 3M committed a Walker Process violation but not a sham litigation violation ; and TransWeb is entitled to lost profits and attorney_fees as antitrust_damages

The district_court entered judgment in accordance with the jury verdicts
3M moved for judgment as a matter of law which the district_court denied
3M appeals
We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
