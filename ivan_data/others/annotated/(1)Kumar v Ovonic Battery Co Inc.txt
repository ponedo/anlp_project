Kaplesh_Kumar owner of U.S._Patent_No._4565,686 ( the `` ¡¬686_patent `` ) appeals the decision of the United_States_District_Court for the District of Massachusetts granting summary_judgment of non-infringement to Ovonic Battery Company Inc. and Energy_Conversion_Devices Inc. *1366 ( collectively `` Ovonic '' )
We vacate the district_court 's grant of summary_judgment and remand the case for further proceedings

BACKGROUND
In the early 1980s Kumar discovered that the use of certain rare earth-transition metal alloys to store hydrogen in rechargeable_nickel_metal_hydride_batteries would overcome the inevitable fracturing associated with repeated recharging
Prior art alloys had a crystalline molecular structure meaning that their molecules were arranged in a regular repeating pattern
These prior art crystalline alloys degraded severely with the repeated cycles of hydrogen storage and release that accompanied recharging
Kumar found that certain alloys with a less ordered molecular structure were immune to material fracture and had improved hydrogen storage capacity
Kumar applied for a patent on this invention in 1981 and the ¡¬686_patent issued on January 21 1986
In the patent that finally issued he chose to describe these alloys as `` amorphous ''
Independent claims 1_and_6 of the ¡¬686_patent read as follows : 1
A system for retrievably storing hydrogen comprising : an amorphous_rare_earth-transition_metal_alloy_material ; a container for said material and
means for supplying hydrogen to said material and exhausting hydrogen from said material for respective absorption and desorption thereby
'686_patent col._5,_ll._17-24 ( emphasis added )
6
A process for reversibly storing hydrogen in an amorphous_rare_earth-transition_metal_alloy_material comprising the steps of : supplying hydrogen to amorphous_rare_earth-transition_metal_alloy_material in a closed system cycling said hydrogen over said alloy_material to cause hydrogen to be stored in said alloy_material ; and withdrawing hydrogen from said system to retrieve the stored hydrogen
Id. col._6,_ll._12-20 ( emphasis added )

Ovonic the alleged infringer here sought patents in the same field
Ovonic is the owner of U.S._Patent_No._4623,597 ( the `` ¡¬597_patent `` ) issued on November 18 1986 on a rechargeable hydrogen battery comprising : at least one anode for reversibly electrochemically charging and discharging hydrogen said anode comprising a disordered_multicomponent_material said disordered_multicomponent_material having at least one structure from the group consisting of : amorphous microcrystalline polycrystalline lacking long-range order compositional order with three or more phases of said polycrystalline structure and any combination of said amorphous microcrystalline and polycrystalline structures.. '597_patent col._13,_l._60- col._14,_l._2 ( emphasis added )
In 1994 Ovonic filed another rechargeable battery application that matured into U.S. Patent No._5840,440 ( the `` ¡¬440_patent `` ) in 1998
This patent claimed in relevant part `` [ a ] n improved high capacity hydrogen storage material '' consisting of alloys with a `` crystallite size.. less than 200 Angstroms [ 20nm ] ''
¡¬440_patent col._13,_l._56- col._14,_l._2 9
Kumar sued Ovonic in the District Court of Massachusetts for direct contributory and induced infringement of the ¡¬686_patent asserting in part that Ovonic 's grants of licenses under the ¡¬597 and ¡¬440_patent s constituted infringement of the ¡¬ 686 patent

Ovonic filed a motion for summary_judgment of non-infringement
Ovonic urged *1367 that the term `` amorphous '' alloys in the ¡¬686_patent should be construed to mean `` completely '' amorphous ( i.e. where there is no ordering of molecules ) and that Ovonic did not infringe the ¡¬686_patent because the batteries produced under its licenses did not use completely amorphous_alloys
Kumar v. Ovonic Battery Co. Inc. No._01- CV-11247-MEL slip op.at 4 ( D.Mass
July_8,_2002 )
Kumar urged that the term `` amorphous '' was not limited to completely amorphous_alloys but instead should be construed to cover all partially crystalline alloys with long_range_order less than 100 nm which would have included alloys described in the ¡¬597 and ¡¬440_patent s and used in Ovonic 's batteries
Id.at 6
Ovonic also argued that it was not liable for infringement because it had merely patented and licensed the batteries that were accused of infringement
Id.at 4_n._2 ( citing 35 U.S.C.¡± 271 ( a ) which defines infringement as `` mak [ ing ] us [ ing ] offer [ ing ] to sell or sell [ ing ] any patented invention '' )
The district_court construed the ¡¬686_patent claims as urged by Ovonic
The court found that the ¡¬686_patent 's specification and prosecution history supported Ovonic 's definition of amorphous whereas Kumar 's definition had been `` developed after his patent was filed and therefore [ could not ] be taken to describe accurately what he sought to patent ''
Id.at 7 ( emphasis in original )
The court granted summary_judgment of non-infringement based on its claim_construction and did not decide whether Ovonic 's licensing actions would have made it liable for infringement under Kumar 's proposed claim_construction explaining that the latter question raised `` disputes of material fact ''
Id.at 4_n._2
