United States Court of Appeals Federal Circuit
SOUTHWALL TECHNOLOGIES INC. Plaintiff-Appellant v. CARDINAL IG COMPANY Defendant-Appellee
No._94-1243
| May_10,_1995
| Rehearing Denied ; Suggestion for Rehearing In Banc Declined June_21,_1995
Synopsis
Patentee brought infringement action in connection with patent for heat_mirror a coating applied to surfaces which allowed visible_light to pass through but reflected heat which was useful as window glazing material
The United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of California D. Lowell Jensen J. granted summary_judgment of noninfringement for defendant and patentee appealed
The Court of Appeals Michel Circuit_Judge held that : ( 1 ) defendant 's heat_mirror did not literally infringe patent as it did not have `` sputter-deposited '' dielectric_layer and ( 2 ) claim of infringement under doctrine of equivalents was barred by prosecution history estoppel

Opinion
MICHEL Circuit_Judge
Southwall Technologies Inc. ( Southwall ) appeals the March_2,_1994 decision of the United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of California Docket No
C-92-0327-DLJ granting summary_judgment for Cardinal IG Company ( Cardinal ) that Cardinal 's LOE 2 window glazing product can not infringe Southwall 's Reexamined U.S. Patent No
B1 4,799,745 ( the '745_patent )
Because the district_court as a matter of law correctly interpreted the claims of the '745_patent to foreclose literal infringement and correctly concluded that as limited by prosecution history the range of permissible equivalents precluded infringement under the doctrine of equivalents we affirm

BACKGROUND
The invention of the '745_patent is an improved heat_mirror a thin transparent coating applied to glass or plastic that allows visible_light to pass through but reflects heat ( infrared light )
Such coatings are useful as window glazing materials
A heat_mirror generally comprises one or more thin layers of silver which are transparent to visible_light but reflect heat spaced apart by a layer of dielectric_material typically metal oxide an anti-reflective non-absorbing material that decreases the reflection and increases the transmission of visible_light
Two silver_layers spaced apart by a dielectric_layer form a Fabry-Perot interference_filter
The heat_mirror may also include additional_layers of dielectric or other materials due to manufacturing constraints

The specification of the '745_patent describes the invention as an improvement over the heat_mirror of the Apfel_patent U.S. Patent No._3682,528
The Apfel_patent teaches that to obtain thin optically suitable layers of silver it is necessary to first lay down a thin `` nucleation '' layer of nickel and then apply the silver over the nickel by vacuum deposition methods
Apfel further teaches that the silver_layer may be coated with a thin layer of vapor-deposited nickel ( a post-coat layer ) to improve the durability of the heat_mirror if another layer such as a dielectric_layer is to be applied over the silver_layer
Apfel 's nucleation and post-coat layers may be a clear dielectric_material such as titanium_oxide rather than nickel
Because the nucleation and post-coat layers are time consuming and expensive to produce an objective of Southwall 's invention was to provide a Fabry-Perot filter with minimal complexity and production steps
The invention of the '745_patent accomplishes this objective by `` employing as the interference_filter a multilayer stack including at least two separate discrete continuous sputter-deposited transparent_metal_layers separated from one another by discrete continuous layers of dielectric ''

Claim 14 of the reexamined1 '745_patent asserted by Southwall recites ( emphasis added ) :2

*1574 A visually transparent infrared reflecting composite film comprising a transparent support having adhered to one surface thereof an interference_filter having a plurality of continuous directly contiguous stacked layers said layers comprising : a. a dielectric_layer b
[ a ] discrete_sputter-deposited transparent_metal_layer c. one or more pairs of layers each pair comprising a dielectric spacer layer and a discrete_sputter-deposited transparent_metal_layer and
d. a dielectric outer layer wherein the dielectric is a sputter-deposited dielectric ; the metal layers each comprise silver and each are from 4_to_17 nm in thickness and the dielectric_layers each have an index of refraction of from about 1.75 to about 2.25 with the spacer layers having a thickness of from 70_to_100 nm and outer layers having a thickness of from about 30 nm to about 70 nm
In other_words claim 14 recites a support such as glass or plastic which is coated with `` continuous directly contiguous stacked layers '' of sputter-deposited3 dielectric silver sputter-deposited dielectric silver and finally sputter-deposited dielectric_material
The '745 specification defines `` directly contiguous '' as having `` its usual meaning of being in actual contact i.e. of being adjoining ''
When the examiner nevertheless questioned the meaning of `` directly contiguous '' in a July_5,_1988 office action Southwall replied : The term `` directly '' as used in the claims is intended to mean that the layers are present or laid down contiguous with one another without intervening layers
In other_words no nucleation layers are present between two `` directly contiguous '' layers or between layers which are laid down `` directly '' on one another
In accordance with Southwall 's own definition unlike the interference_filter disclosed in the Apfel_patent the interference_filter recited in claim 14 can have no additional_layers between the silver and the sputter-deposited dielectric_layers not even nucleation or sacrificial barrier layers
Cardinal 's LOE2 product consists of the following layers on a glass support : zinc_oxide ( a dielectric ) silver titanium_oxide ( a dielectric ) zinc_oxide silver titanium_oxide zinc_oxide titanium dioxide and a final zinc_oxide_layer
The titanium_oxide_layer is formed by a two-step_process in which titanium_metal is first sputtered in a nonreactive argon atmosphere to form a layer of titanium_metal covering the silver_layer
The zinc_oxide_layer is formed by a reactive sputtering process involving the sputtering of zinc_metal in an oxygen atmosphere
Sputtered zinc_metal reacts with the oxygen to form zinc_oxide which is deposited directly onto the surface
During this process the layer of titanium_metal already there is converted to titanium_oxide by the action of oxygen.4 The titanium_metal layer acts as a `` sacrificial barrier layer '' by protecting the silver_layer from oxidation during formation of the zinc_oxide dielectric_layer.5 For purposes of summary_judgment analysis we assume it is completely converted to titanium_oxide during this step
In sum Cardinal 's zinc_oxide_layer is formed by a one-step reactive sputtering process in which zinc_oxide is directly deposited whereas its titanium_oxide_layer is formed by a two-step_process wherein the first step requires deposition of titanium_metal and the second step requires oxidation of titanium_metal to create titanium_oxide

Southwall filed the present suit on January 14 1992 alleging that Cardinal 's LOE 2 heat_mirror infringes the '745_patent
Cardinal moved for summary_judgment on the grounds that ( 1 ) its product does not infringe the '745_patent ( 2 ) the '745_patent is invalid *1575 for failure to state the best mode of the invention and ( 3 ) the '745_patent is invalid as either anticipated by or obvious in light of the prior art
The district_court granted Cardinal 's summary_judgment motion on the first ground but denied it on the other two
Southwall appeals the ruling that Cardinal does not infringe the '745_patent either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents

We have jurisdiction over this patent infringement action pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( 1988 )
