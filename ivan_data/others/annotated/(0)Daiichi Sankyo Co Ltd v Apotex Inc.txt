Opinion
ARCHER Senior_Circuit_Judge Apotex Inc. and Apotex_Corp. ( collectively `` Apotex '' ) appeal the judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the District of New_Jersey that Apotex infringes U.S. Pat
No._5401,741 ( `` the ¡¬741_patent `` ) and that the ¡¬741_patent is not invalid or unenforceable
Daiichi Pharm Co. v. Apotex Inc. 441_F.Supp.2d_672 ( D.N.J.2006 ) ( `` Validity Determination `` )
Because the invention of the ¡¬741_patent would have been obvious in view of the prior art we reverse

I
The ¡¬741_patent is drawn to a method for treating bacterial_ear_infections by topically administering the antibiotic_ofloxacin into the ear.BIG_TOKEN__1_Claim_1__BIG_TOKEN is representative and states `` [ a ] method for treating otopathy *1256 which comprises the topical otic administration of an amount of ofloxacin or a salt thereof effective to treat otopathy in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier to the area affected with otopathy ''
¡¬ 741 Patent col.6 ll.36-39

Apotex filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application ( `` ANDA '' ) seeking approval to manufacture a generic_ofloxacin_ear_drop including a ?
IV certification that the ¡¬741_patent was invalid and/or not infringed
Following receipt of the ANDA Daiichi owner of the ¡¬741_patent sued Apotex for infringement
Following a Markman hearing the district court construed the claim term `` effective to treat '' as `` efficacious and safe ''
Based on this construction and following a bench trial the court concluded that the ¡¬741_patent was not invalid
The court also found that Daiichi did not intend to deceive the Patent and Trademark Office during prosecution of the ¡¬741_patent
Finally because Apotex stipulated that the subject matter of its ANDA fell within the scope of the claims of the ¡¬741_patent the court found that Apotex infringed the ¡¬741_patent

Apotex appeals and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
