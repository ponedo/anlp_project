United States Court of Appeals Federal Circuit
NOVO NORDISK A/S Novo Nordisk of North America Inc. and Novo Nordisk Pharmaceuticals Inc. Plaintiffs-Appellants v. BECTON DICKINSON AND COMPANY Defendant-Cross Appellant
Nos._01-1095 01-1114
| DECIDED : Sept._19,_2002
Synopsis
Owner of insulin syringe patents sued competitor for infringement
The United_States_District_Court for the Southern District of New_York Barbara S. Jones J. granted judgment for competitor 96_F.Supp.2d_309
Owner appealed
The Court of Appeals Pauline Newman Circuit_Judge held that : ( 1 ) substantial_evidence existed for reasonable_jury to conclude that patent on insulin syringe was invalid as obvious ; ( 2 ) miscarriage of justice did not occur by court 's refusal to include jury instruction that `` obvious to try '' was not correct legal standard for determination of obviousness ; ( 3 ) new trial was not warranted on grounds of prejudice ; and ( 4 ) competitor could not appeal district_court 's denial of its motion for summary_judgment

Opinion
PAULINE NEWMAN Circuit_Judge
The Novo Nordisk companies ( collectively `` Novo '' ) appeal the judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the Southern *1218 District of New_York entered pursuant to jury_verdict that all of the claims of U.S
Patents No._5462,535 ( the ¡¬535_patent ) and No._5999,323 ( the ¡¬323_patent ) are invalid on the ground of obviousness and that U.S. Patent No._5984,906 ( the ¡¬906_patent ) is invalid based on same-invention double patenting and obviousness
Becton Dickinson and Company ( Becton ) conditionally cross-appeals the district_court 's denial of its pre-trial motion for summary_judgment on the ground of anticipation
We affirm the district_court 's judgment,1 and dismiss the cross-appeal

DISCUSSION
The ¡¬535 ¡¬323 and ¡¬906_patent s are directed to a pen-shaped insulin delivery system for use by diabetic patients
The system comprises a pen-shaped syringe having an insulin-containing cartridge and is designed to inject a measured amount of insulin through a needle
The invalidity issues turn on the diameter of the needle
Needle diameter is important to insulin_injection_systems for crystallization and other aspects of insulin solutions limit their ability to flow through very narrow needles
Conversely the pain associated with injection increases with the size of the needle

The claims of the ¡¬535 and ¡¬323_patent s are specific to injection pens having needles of 30 gauge ( G-30 )BIG_TOKEN__2_Claim_1__BIG_TOKEN of the ¡¬535_patent is representative :

1
An insulin_injection_system comprising a pen shaped syringe comprising a cartridge with insulin and an injection_needle wherein the needle is a G30_needle and the cartridge contains an insulin_type which may freely flow through the G30_needle
The ¡¬906_patent defines the needle as `` thinner than G-29 '' as illustrated in claim 1 : 1
An insulin system comprising a pen shaped syringe comprising a cartridge with insulin and an injection_needle wherein the needle is thinner than a G-29_needle and the cartridge contains an insulin_type which may freely flow through a needle thinner than a G-29_needle
The court construed the `` thinner than G-29 '' limitation of the ¡¬906_claims to mean `` thinner than 29 gauge but not thinner than 30 gauge ''
Becton stipulated to infringement if the patents were valid and Novo agrees that there is double patenting if the court 's construction of the ¡¬906_claims is correct
Obviousness-The ¡¬535 and ¡¬323_Patent s. The jury concluded that the ¡¬535 and ¡¬323_patent s are invalid on the ground of obviousness in view of several references offered by Becton
These references are of two general categories
The first category describes pen-style insulin_injection_systems but either does not state the needle_size or shows needles of 27_and_28 gauge
For example U.S._Patent_No._4973,318 ( the Holm patent ) describes a pen-shaped insulin_injection_system substantially the same as that shown in the Novo patents except that it does not state the needle gauge

The second category of references shows 30 gauge needles for insulin_injection but not in insulin pens
For example *1219 U.S._Patent_No._4552,561 ( the Eckenhoff patent ) shows a 30 gauge needle in a rotary syringe for insulin_injection and U.S._Patent_No._4894,054 ( the Miskinyar patent ) describes syringes for insulin_injection with needle diameters in the range of 23_to_30 gauge

At the trial there were no significant disputes as to the facts of the scope and content of the prior_art the level of ordinary_skill and the nature of the claimed invention
See Graham v. John Deere Co. 383_U.S._1 17 86_S.Ct._684 15_L.Ed.2d_545 148_USPQ_459 467 ( 1966 )
The only question argued to the jury was that of motivation to combine the teachings of the references in order to produce the claimed device
Novo argues that Becton failed to establish a motivation supported by prior_art whereby a person of ordinary_skill in this field would have been motivated to combine the teachings of these references to produce the insulin pen of the ¡¬535 and ¡¬323_patent s

Becton 's experts Dr. Snyderman and Dr. Sherwin testified that it was well known that thinner needles reduced the pain associated with self-administered insulin_injections and that this knowledge provided motivation to reduce the needle_size
Novo 's expert Dr. Charles testified similarly stating that the `` trick '' was to get the needle_size down in order to reduce the pain associated with insulin needle injections
Novo stresses its evidence of commercial success and copying
Although Novo points to the absence of documentary evidence of motivation and criticizes the presentation of `` conclusory '' testimony by Becton 's witnesses these are matters of weight and credibility

There was substantial_evidence whereby a reasonable_jury could have found that the known pain reduction provided the requisite motivation to narrow the needle
See In re Beattie 974_F.2d_1309 1311 24_USPQ2d_1040 1041-42 ( Fed.Cir.1992 ) ( motivation to combine references to achieve the claimed invention is a question of fact )
The jury_verdict of obviousness is not vulnerable on this ground
