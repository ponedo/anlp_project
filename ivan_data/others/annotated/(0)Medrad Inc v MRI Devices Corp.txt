Opinion
BRYSON Circuit_Judge
Medrad Inc. brought this action in the United_States_District_Court for the Western_District of Pennsylvania CA No._02-2044 alleging that MRI Devices Corp. ( `` MRIDC '' ) was infringing Medrad 's patent U.S. Patent No._6396,273 ( `` the '273_patent `` )
The district_court referred the case to a magistrate_judge under 28 U.S.C.¡± 636 ( b ) ( 1 )
After a hearing the magistrate_judge recommended that MRIDC 's motion for partial summary judgment of invalidity be granted and that Medrad 's motion for a preliminary injunction be denied
The district_court adopted the magistrate_judge 's recommendation
We affirm

I
This case arises from a dispute over devices known as radio_frequency_coils ( `` RF_coils '' ) which are used in magnetic_resonance_imaging ( `` MRI '' )
MRI uses nuclear magnetic resonance to create detailed images of a patient 's internal anatomy
See generally David D. Stark & William G. Bradley Jr. 1 Magnetic_Resonance_Imaging 1-14 ( 3d ed.1999 )
In the MRI process a portion of the patient 's body is placed in an extremely strong magnetic_field
The magnetic_field causes the nuclei within the atoms of the body to partially align with the magnetic_field in equilibrium
The partial alignment of the nuclei creates a net_magnetization within the body in the direction of the magnetic_field
A second time-varying magnetic_field is then created in an orthogonal direction by applying electrical current in pulses to RF_coils that surround the body
The second magnetic_field drags the net_magnetization of the body away from the direction of the main_magnetic_field
According to the laws of quantum mechanics the affected nuclei and thus the net_magnetization will precess around the direction of the main_magnetic_field at a rate known as the Larmor frequency before dephasing and eventually realigning with the main_magnetic_field
E. Mark Haacke Magnetic_Resonance_Imaging : Physical Principles and Sequence Design 5-8 ( 1999 )
The precession induces a current in the RF_coils which can be measured
That signal can then be used to reconstruct an image of the internal tissues of the portion of the patient 's body that was under study

It was well known in the prior art that the current in the RF_coils could be detected at a much higher signal-to-noise ratio if many small overlapping RF_coils were used in a `` phased array '' to receive the signal from the precessing nuclei
It was advantageous for the same coils to be used both to create the time-varying magnetic_field ( `` transmission '' ) and to receive the resulting signal from the precessing nuclei ( `` reception '' )
The problem however was that identical pulses of current could not be passed through the overlapping coils during transmission because that would result in the magnetic_field in the overlap region being roughly twice as large as in the areas of the coil outside of the overlap
According to the inventor George J. Misic that is the problem the '273_patent was meant to solve
