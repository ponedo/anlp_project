Synopsis
Background : Patent owner brought action against competitors alleging infringement of patent claiming portable_microprocessor_system with sufficient_processing_power memory and network_compatibility for business_applications
The United_States_District_Court for the Western_District of Wisconsin Barbara B. Crabb Chief_Judge granted judgment for competitors
Owner appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Rader Circuit_Judge held that :

terms `` portable_computer '' and `` portable_computer microprocessing system '' limited scope of asserted claims ;

term `` portable '' meant capable of being moved about ;

phrases `` portable_computer '' and `` portable_computer microprocessing system '' excluded computers with built-in displays or keyboards ;

examiner 's citation of single connection limitation in reasons for allowability did not erase applicants ' clear_disavowal of laptops during prosecution ;

applicants ' clear_disavowal of laptops in prosecution_history based on evidence of pre-filing activities in record did not mean that infringement action was objectively baseless ; and

owner 's decision to continue infringement litigation after district_court 's adverse claim construction did not make case exceptional

Opinion
RADER Circuit_Judge
On summary_judgment the United_States_District_Court for the Western_District of Wisconsin determined that Dell Inc. Gateway Inc. Toshiba_America Inc. and Toshiba_America_Information_Systems Inc. ( collectively Defendants ) did not infringe claims 17-20 22 24 and 26-28 of *1370 Computer Docking Station Corporation 's ( CDSC 's ) United States Patent No._5187,645 ( '645_patent )

LEXIS 2419 ( W.D.Wis
Jan.10 2007 ) ( Summary_Judgment_Order )
Because the patentee disavowed an interpretation of `` portable_computer '' that would encompass a computer with a built-in display or keyboard this court affirms the district_court 's holding of no infringement
This court also affirms the district_court 's finding that the case was not exceptional and that attorney_fees were not warranted under 35 U.S.C.¡± 285

I
The ¡¬645_patent claims a portable_microprocessor_system with sufficient_processing_power memory and network_compatibility for business_applications
¡¬645_patent col.3 II.18-20
Figure 1 below depicts this system with the microprocessor contained in the main_housing under the label 10
The specification teaches that the main_housing 's size and weight account in part for the system 's portability
Id
col.1_II.29-36 56-62 ; col.3 II.44-45
The main_housing `` resembles a brick '' about eleven inches high eight inches wide and three inches thick
It weighs approximately eight pounds
As illustrated in Figure 2 the main_housing may fit in one half of an attache case
Id
col.3 II.33-45

?
The system also includes the capability to connect to peripheral_devices such as a keyboard or mouse
The parties agree that the term `` peripheral_device '' means `` an external device that is capable of connecting to and is capable of being controlled by a computer ''

The main_housing connects to these peripheral_devices either through individual_connectors ( one connector per peripheral_device ) or through a docking connector which `` allows all peripheral connections to be realized through a single_connector ''
¡¬645_patent col.1 II.24-31 ; col.2 II.23-34
The docking connector simplifies coupling and decoupling of the main_housing with peripheral_devices
Id
col.1_II.29-36 ; col.3 II.64-66 ( `` [ O ] nly one connection is necessary to disconnect the system or connect the system `` )
Figure 6 illustrates individual connections between the main_housing and each peripheral_device ; Figure 3 illustrates a connection between the main_housing and docking connector
Id
col.7 II.23-26 ; col.2 II.42-43

*1371. ?
The specification explains that a keyboard and visual display are `` options available with the system ''
Id
col.2 II.8-11
Figures 13-15 illustrate these options
Figure 13 shows that a keyboard 60 and display 58 `` may be coupled with the microcomputer system ''
Id
col.7 II.23-24
The keyboard connects to the housing using connector 24b shown on the left-hand side of the rear bezel in Figure 6
Id
col.5 II.30-31
As shown in Figure 14 display 58 is also external to the housing but may be attached to and removed from it using individual_connectors and thumbscrews
Id
col.7 II.28-42
Figure 15 shows the housing as it fits with the display and keyboard

?
Each of the asserted claims requires a `` portable_computer '' or `` portable_computer microprocessing system '' ( the `` portable_computer_limitation '' ) and a `` single_connector for making all connections from the microprocessor to said specific_computer_peripheral_devices '' ( the `` all connections_limitation '' )
Claim 28 is representative of the three asserted independent claims : 28
A portable_computer comprising : a ) a microprocessor for processing instructions ; b ) a housing containing the microprocessor ; c ) a plurality of computer-peripheral-device-specific_connectors in electrical_communication with the microprocessor such that each of said plurality of computer-peripheral-device specific_connectors provides a computer-peripheral-device specific data link to said microprocessors said connectors for connecting the microprocessor to specific_computer_peripheral_devices *1372 and being mounted on the housing ; and
d ) another single_connector on the housing said single_connector comprising a set of pins said set further comprising a plurality of subsets of computer-peripheral-device-specific_pins being in electrical_communication with said microprocessor such that one of each of said subsets of computer-peripheral-device-specific_pins provides the same computer-peripheral-device-specific data link as said each of said plurality of computer-peripheral-device-specific_connectors said single_connector for making all connections from the microprocessor to said specific_computer_peripheral_devices

During prosecution the examiner rejected several claims as anticipated and obvious in view of U.S. Patent No._5030,128 to Herron et al
( ¡¬128_patent or Herron )
Herron discloses a laptop_computer and a docking_module that facilitates operation on a desktop
Herron connects each peripheral to the docking_module
¡¬128_patent col.2 II.3-38
Attempting to distinguish Herron the applicants expressly defined their invention in different terms
In addition the applicants amended the claims
After an interview the examiner found that the amended `` claims directed to redundant connectors ( one set plural & one a single_connector ) would be allowable ''
The ¡¬645_patent issued in February 1993 and was later assigned to CDSC

Defendants produce various computer devices including laptops and docking_stations
In its amended complaint CDSC identified a number of defendants ' laptop_computers and docking_stations as infringing
The record shows that each accused laptop_computer has a built-in display or keyboard

The district_court construed `` portable_computer '' and `` portable_computer microprocessing system '' in the preambles of the asserted claims to mean `` a computer without a built-in display or keyboard that is capable of being moved or carried about ''
Claim_Construction_Order 2006 U.S._Dist
LEXIS 58388 at *32-33
The trial court determined that the prosecution_history and the specification distinguished the claimed invention from a laptop_computer
In particular the district_court found that the applicants had emphasized the differences between their invention and laptop_computers to overcome the examiner 's rejections based on Herron
Because the district_court held that the statements in the prosecution_history amounted to a clear and unmistakable disavowal it construed the terms `` portable_computer '' and `` portable_computer microprocessing system '' to exclude computers with built-in displays or keyboards
Id.at *18-24
The district_court also construed the phrase `` said single_connector for making all connections from the microprocessor to said computer peripheral_devices '' to require `` that all individual peripheral_device connections on the housing that connect to the microprocessor also pass through the single_connector ''
Id.at *40-45

Based on these claim interpretations CDSC itself sought entry of final judgment of non-infringement conceding that none of the accused products meets the court 's construction of the portable_computer_limitation
CDSC also noted that some of the accused products do not satisfy the all connections_limitation
CDSC admitted that each accused product `` includes a computer that has a keyboard and display that *1373 are affixed to the housing.. and are not designed to be detached in ordinary use ''

and Certification Case_No._06-_C-0032-C Docket No._105 filed Sept._15,_2006 at 2
Defendants opposed the motion because the parties could not agree on the form of judgment for the all connections_limitation
The district_court denied CDSC 's motion

Defendants then moved for summary_judgment of non-infringement based on both limitations
Because Defendants introduced new documents in support of their motion as it related to the all connections_limitation CDSC filed a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 ( f ) motion for additional discovery
The district_court denied the Rule 56 ( f ) motion and granted Defendants ' motion for summary_judgment based on both limitations

CDSC appeals the district_court 's construction of the portable_computer and all connections_limitations its grant of summary_judgment on both limitations and its denial of CDSC 's Rule 56 ( f ) motion
Defendants appeal the district_court 's denial of the motion for attorney_fees
