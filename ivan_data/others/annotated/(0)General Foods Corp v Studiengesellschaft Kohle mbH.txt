Opinion
RICH Circuit_Judge
Studiengesellschaft Kohle mbH ( SGK ) as trustee for real-party-in-interest Max Planck Institute for Coal Research appeals from the June_12,_1991 judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the Southern_District of New_York Civil Action No._88-8343 declaring invalid claims 1_and_4 of SGK 's U.S. Patent No._4260,639 ( '639_patent ) titled `` Process for the Decaffeination of Coffee '' on the sole ground of `` double_patenting '' in view of SGK 's earlier-issued U.S. Patent No._3806,619 ( '619_patent ) titled `` Process for Recovering Caffeine ''
Because there is no double_patenting we reverse

BACKGROUND
This declaratory_judgment_suit is between a licensor and licensee over patents relating to decaffeinated_coffee
Plaintiff General Foods Corporation ( GF ) owns Maxwell House Coffee Company which manufactures decaffeinated_coffee at its AMCO_plant in Houston Texas for sale under brands such as Sanka Maxim Brim Yuban and Maxwell House
GF also owns Kaffee HAG a processor and research company in Bremen Germany which is said to have been the first producer of decaffeinated_coffee

SGK developed in Europe inventions relating to decaffeination and owned five United States patents involved in this lawsuit
Learning about SGK 's developments GF entered into an exclusive license agreement with SGK effective February 1 1978 which has now become a nonexclusive license on which it paid royalties to SGK through 1990 since then paying further royalties under protest
The license agreement provided for advance payments totalling $ 1,800,000 during the first year
Royalties were to range from 1.75 % of net decaffeinated_coffee sales up to 40,000,000 *1274 pounds down to 1.25 % of net sales over 120,000,000 pounds

GF brought this suit for a declaration of non-infringement invalidity and unenforceability as to all five patents
However the District_Court found that although all five SGK patents were licensed SGK now asserts that only claims 1_and_4 of the '639_patent would be infringed by GF 's operation at the AMCO_plant and that the other four patents are no longer in suit
Although GF asserted numerous defenses against claims 1_and_4 including invalidity for `` obviousness-type double_patenting '' non-infringement obviousness under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103 non-enablement under 35 U.S.C.¡± 112 and unenforceability due to inequitable conduct before the Patent and Trademark Office ( PTO ) the District_Court issued an Order of Trial on April_5,_1991 on GF 's motion to `` bifurcate the issue of double_patenting ''
The order further stated `` If the decision does not dispose of the action trial will then immediately continue on the remaining issues ''

The District_Court held a separate trial on the single issue of double_patenting
A judgment was entered holding claims 1_and_4 of the '639_patent invalid thus terminating GF 's declaratory_judgment_suit seeking invalidity of the only patent it was alleged to be infringing and putting an end to its obligation to pay SGK royalties under its contract
765_F.Supp._121

This appeal followed and as above stated there is only one issue for us to decide-is there double_patenting
We shall first discuss the facts regarding the two patents involved and then the law of double_patenting as it applies to those facts
