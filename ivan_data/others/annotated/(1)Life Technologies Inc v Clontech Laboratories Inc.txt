United States Court of Appeals Federal Circuit
LIFE TECHNOLOGIES INC. Plaintiff-Appellant v. CLONTECH LABORATORIES INC. Defendant-Appellee
No._99-1550
| Sept._21,_2000
Synopsis
Patentee brought action against competitor alleging infringement of patents for engineered reverse transcriptase ( RT ) enzyme
Following bench_trial the United_States_District_Court for the District of Maryland Alexander Williams Jr. J. held that patents were unenforceable on ground of inequitable_conduct and patentee appealed
The Court of Appeals Gajarsa Circuit_Judge held that : ( 1 ) manner in which inventors used prior_art_article that was disclosed during patent application process and motivations that inventors derived from article were not `` material '' to application ; ( 2 ) inventors ' assertion that they had no reasonable_expectation of success as to their following of prior_art_article was not affirmative representation that would support finding of inequitable_conduct ; and ( 3 ) inventors ' failure to disclose information regarding work of rival researcher did not amount to inequitable_conduct

Reversed and remanded

Opinion
GAJARSA Circuit_Judge
Life_Technologies Inc. ( `` LTI '' ) appeals the judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the District of Maryland entered after a bench_trial in which the court held that LTI 's U.S
Patents Nos._5244,797 ( `` the '797_patent `` ) and 5,668,005 ( `` the '005_patent `` ) were unenforceable on the ground of inequitable_conduct
Because the court premised this determination on clearly erroneous findings of fact we reverse and remand

BACKGROUND
Reverse transcriptase ( `` RT '' ) is a naturally occurring enzyme that exhibits DNA_polymerase_activity
DNA_polymerase_activity enables the RT_enzyme to utilize a messenger RNA ( `` mRNA '' ) molecule as a template to synthesize a complementary strand of DNA ( `` cDNA '' )
This reaction results in a DNA/RNA hybrid molecule
In addition to DNA_polymerase_activity naturally occurring RT known as `` wild-type '' RT also exhibits RNase_H_activity
RNase_H_activity degrades the original mRNA template as the cDNA molecule is made
RNase_H_activity is undesirable because this degradation of the mRNA template negatively affects the ability and efficiency of the RT to make cDNA

Beginning in the early 1980 's the inventors of the '797 and '005_patent s Drs
Michael Kotewicz and Gary Gerard sought to develop a genetically engineered RT_enzyme that exhibited DNA_polymerase_activity but did not substantially exhibit RNase_H_activity
Kotewicz and Gerard faced several difficulties in developing this enzyme
First it was unknown at the time where on the RT_molecule the DNA polymerase and RNase H activities resided
Further it was unknown whether the RNase_H_activity could be selectively removed to produce an improved mutant_RT_enzyme that retained DNA_polymerase_activity
The inventors spent several years unsuccessfully attempting to locate and delete the RNase_H_activity from the RT_molecule

The breakthrough for the inventors came in 1986 with the publication of M.S
Johnson et al. Computer Analysis of Retroviral Pol Genes : Assignment of Enzymatic Functions to Specific Sequences and Homologies with Nonviral Enzymes 83 Proceedings of the Nat ' l
Acad
of Sci
7648 ( 1986 ) ( `` the Johnson_article '' )
The Johnson_article reported comparisons made between amino sequences of certain RT_molecules and the sequence of the ribonuclease enzyme from E. coli which exhibits RNase_H_activity but not DNA_polymerase_activity
The findings of Johnson suggested to the inventors that the RNase_H_activity of the RT_enzyme resided at the carboxyl_terminal_end of the molecule
The inventors however were skeptical of Johnson 's results because the literature existing at the time suggested that the location of the RNase_H_activity was at the front end of the RT_molecule
Additionally the Johnson_article was suspect because it utilized computer comparisons of amino acid sequences rather than experimental data
Such computer comparisons were fairly new in the art at the time
Thus in order to `` exclude the possibility '' that Johnson was correct Kotewicz and Gerard decided to conduct experiments at the carboxyl_terminal_end of the RT_enzyme
Contrary to expectations these experiments were successful and by December 1986 the inventors had created a mutant_RT_enzyme that lacked RNase_H_activity but retained DNA_polymerase_activity

A few months after confirming their discovery Kotewicz and Gerard learned that another researcher Dr. Stephen Goff was working to develop an engineered RT_enzyme
*1323 On April_15,_1987 Kotewicz spoke on the telephone with Goff a researcher at Columbia University
During this conversation Goff stated that he had developed `` oligonucleotide insertion mutations that reduce RNase H in cloned [ RT ] ''
However there is no indication in the record that Goff revealed any further details concerning his work to Kotewicz during this conversation
Additionally during the summer of 1987 Gerard learned that Goff had presented his RT research at Stanford University
Although neither Gerard nor Kotewicz attended this presentation they surmised based on conversations with colleagues that Goff demonstrated `` similar results '' as the inventors
Based on this information Kotewicz and Gerard urged LTI to allow them to publish their results as quickly as possible under the assumption that Goff would soon publish similar work
They also submitted forms to management at LTI that initiated the process for preparing a patent application for their engineered RT_enzyme

In January 1988 Kotewicz and Gerard filed the parent application from which the '797 and '005_patent s ultimately issued
In general the application claimed an engineered RT_enzyme that exhibited DNA_polymerase_activity but did not exhibit substantial RNase_H_activity
As part of the duty of disclosure under 37 C.F.R.¡± 1.56 the inventors disclosed to the Patent and Trademark Office ( `` PTO '' ) numerous prior art references including the Johnson_article
However the inventors did not reveal their knowledge of Goff 's work because their patent attorney indicated that such limited and incomplete information would not be material

During the prosecution leading to the '797_patent the Johnson_article took on particular importance for the Examiner
Several times the Examiner rejected the inventors ' claims as obvious over Johnson often in combination with other prior art that described the RT gene sequence
According to the Examiner because Johnson taught that the RNase_H_activity was located at the carboxyl_terminal_end and because there was a strong motivation in the art to eliminate such activity the claimed invention would have been obvious
In response to these rejections the inventors argued that at the time of the invention there would have been no reasonable_expectation that the application of Johnson 's results would successfully lead to the deletion of RNase_H_activity
This was because the teachings of Johnson were contrary to teachings in the prior art which suggested that `` something more was necessary '' than a deletion at the carboxyl_terminal_end to eliminate RNase_H_activity
Thus the inventors contended that the claimed invention would not have been obvious over Johnson
The Examiner was persuaded by these arguments and the '797_patent issued on September 19 1993
At no time during this prosecution did the inventors reveal to the Examiner that the Johnson_article played a key role in their development of the claimed invention

Shortly after the issuance of the '797_patent the inventors filed the continuation application that eventually resulted in the issuance of the '005_patent
During the prosecution of this application the inventors revealed their knowledge of Goff 's work
The Examiner allowed the application to issue over the newly revealed information regarding Goff stating that the new information had `` no bearing on.. the instant application ''

In December 1996 LTI sued Clontech Laboratories Inc. ( `` Clontech '' ) for infringement of the '797 and '005_patent s. In response Clontech asserted various affirmative defenses including an allegation that the patents should be held unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct
A bench_trial on the inequitable_conduct issue ensued
After the trial the court found that the inventors withheld material information regarding the motivations that they derived from the Johnson_article and their reliance on it in reaching their invention
The court also found that the inventors made affirmative material misrepresentations during prosecution regarding the *1324 Johnson_article
Further the court found that the inventors ' knowledge of Goff 's work was material and should have been revealed to the PTO during the prosecution of the '797_patent
Finally the court determined that these actions were done with the intent to deceive the PTO
As a result the court held that both the '797 and '005_patent were unenforceable on the ground of inequitable_conduct
This appeal followed
