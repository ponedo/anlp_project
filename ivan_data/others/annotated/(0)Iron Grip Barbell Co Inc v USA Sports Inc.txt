Opinion
DYK Circuit_Judge
Iron_Grip Barbell Company ( `` Iron_Grip '' ) appeals from the judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the Central_District of California
The district_court found claims 1_to_3 and 6_to_8 of Iron_Grip 's patent U.S. Patent No._6436,015 ( `` the '015_patent `` ) to be invalid as obvious
We affirm

*1319 BACKGROUND
Iron_Grip is a manufacturer of weight_plates used with fitness equipment such as barbells and is the assignee of the '015_patent
Claim 1 of the '015_patent claims : A weight_plate for physical fitness including : a plate body formed with a central throughbore and.. further formed with solely a triad of spaced apart elongated handle openings disposed generally equiangularly.. said openings having respective outboard edges cooperating with said plate to define a triad of integral handle elements for grasping by a single hand to effect transport of said weight_plate
Id
col._4,_ll._24-35 ( emphasis added )
The other claims in the '015_patent at issue here depend from claim 1 and are not different for present purposes

Typically a barbell consists of a rigid bar and removable weight_plates attached on both ends
Traditional weight_plates had a single hole in the center for attachment to the barbell
A key problem with traditional single-hole weight_plates was that they were difficult to grasp and transport
Iron_Grip 's '015_patent addresses this defect of traditional weight_plates by disclosing a weight_plate with three elongated_openings near the periphery of the plate that function effectively as handles

During the prosecution of the '015_patent Iron_Grip disclosed prior_art showing inter alia weight_plates with one elongated grip U.S._Patent_No._4199,140 ( `` the '140_patent `` ) and two elongated grips U.S. Patent No._5137,502 ( `` the '502_patent `` )
The examiner further considered other prior_art including barbell weight_plates with four openings
U.S._Patent_No._4618,142
After multiple rejections on grounds of obviousness the '015_patent eventually issued on Aug._20,_2002

USA_Sports Inc. ( `` USA_Sports '' ) is a competing manufacturer of weight_plates
It also manufactures a three-grip plate
In May of 2002 Iron_Grip sued USA_Sports in the district_court for infringement of an unrelated patent and subsequently amended its complaint to state an action for infringement of claims 1-BIG_TOKEN__3_and_6__BIG_TOKEN -8 of the '015_patent
USA_Sports defended on the basis that the asserted claims in the '015_patent were invalid as obvious in light of the prior_art
Both sides moved for summary_judgment
The district_court initially granted summary_judgment in favor of Iron_Grip finding that USA_Sport 's weight_plate infringed the '015_patent ; and denied USA_Sport 's summary_judgment motion as to the invalidity of the '015_patent holding that a finding of invalidity for obviousness required a `` suggestion motivation or teaching in the prior_art to combine the elements [ from separate references ] ''
( J.A.at 1897 )
Upon motion for reconsideration however the district_court held that the contested claims in the '015_patent were obvious
The district_court found that its prior understanding of the law was `` unduly restrictive ''
( J.A.at 2921 )
Instead it held that `` the cases.. permit the court to look at the overall picture of what 's really going on..
The obviousness test.. calls upon the court to just simply exercise common sense.. '' ( Id )
Applying this new test the district_court held that `` it would have been obvious to a layman to combine the prior_art '' and invalidated claims 1-BIG_TOKEN__3_and_6__BIG_TOKEN -8 of the '015_patent
( J.A.at 3 )
Iron_Grip appeals
We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )1

*1320 DISCUSSION
I
We review the district_court 's grant of summary_judgment without deference
Karsten Mfg Corp. v. Cleveland Golf Co. 242_F.3d_1376 1379 ( Fed.Cir.2001 )
We therefore affirm the district_court only if there is no genuine issue of material fact as to the invalidity of the claims
In making this determination a patent is presumed to be valid
35 U.S.C.¡± 282 ( 2000 ) ; Cardinal Chem Co. v. Morton Int ' l 508_U.S._83 93_n._15 113_S.Ct._1967 124_L.Ed.2d_1_(1993)
USA_Sports bears the burden of proving invalidity by clear and convincing evidence
Am
Hoist & Derrick Co. v. Sowa & Sons Inc. 725_F.2d_1350 1360 ( Fed.Cir.1984 )

In determining obviousness we employ the four-part test set forth in Graham v. John Deere Co. 383_U.S._1 86_S.Ct._684 15_L.Ed.2d_545_(1966)
This test requires us to examine ( 1 ) the scope and content of the prior_art ; ( 2 ) the level of ordinary_skill in the art ; ( 3 ) the differences between the claimed invention and the prior_art ; and ( 4 ) the objective_evidence of nonobviousness
Id.at 17-18 86_S.Ct._684 ; see also 35 U.S.C.¡± 103 ( 2000 )

We note that neither side disputes that weight_plates showing one two and four elongated_openings were within the prior_art
We also note that neither side disputes that the proper level of ordinary_skill in the art is that of a layman
Therefore the only points of contention in the obviousness inquiry are the differences between the claimed invention and the prior_art and the objective_evidence of nonobviousness
