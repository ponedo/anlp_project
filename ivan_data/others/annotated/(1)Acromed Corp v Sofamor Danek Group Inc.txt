Synopsis
Patentee of improved surgical spinal_plate and improved bone_screw brought infringement action against competitor
After jury_verdict that spinal_plate_patent was invalid for improper_inventorship and that bone_screw_patent was valid the United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of Ohio Ann Aldrich J. granted judgment as a matter of law that spinal_plate_patent was not invalid for improper_inventorship
Competitor appealed
The Court of Appeals Rader Circuit_Judge held that : ( 1 ) evidence was insufficient to establish that engineer was inventor of spinal_plate and bone_screw ; ( 2 ) evidence was insufficient to establish that engineer 's cutting of recessed slots into spinal_plate was inventive conception ; ( 3 ) term `` engage '' in bone_screw claim was properly construed as `` fitting together '' ; ( 4 ) bone_screw_patent was not limited to screw with body portion of diameter at least as large as crest diameter of second externally threaded portion ; and ( 5 ) evidence was insufficient to prove invalidation of bone_screw_patent by prior_art

Opinion
RADER Circuit_Judge
At the close of evidence the United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of Ohio granted judgment as a matter of law ( JMOL ) that AcroMed Corporation 's ( AcroMed 's ) U.S._Patent_No._4696,290 ( '290_patent ) is not invalid for improper_inventorship
The jury 's verdict found that Sofamor Danek Group Inc. and Danek_Medical Inc. ( collectively Danek ) literally infringed the claims of the ¡¬290_patent and AcroMed 's U.S._Patent_No._4854,311 ( '311_patent )
The jury further found the claims of the ¡¬311_patent not invalid
Because the district_court correctly found insufficient evidence to invalidate the ¡¬290_patent and correctly upheld the jury_verdict that the claims of the ¡¬311_patent were infringed and not invalid this court affirms

I. AcroMed is assignee of the ¡¬290_patent which names Dr. Arthur D. Steffee as its sole inventor
The ¡¬290_patent discloses a plate for surgical implantation onto a patient 's spinal column
The spine_plate straightens a spine misshapen by disc degeneration or fracture
This invention can thus alleviate pain and restore a patient 's mobility

In his first spine straightening operations Dr._Steffee hooked and wired rods to patients ' spines
This early method straightened spines somewhat but the rods would later slip thereby undercutting the effectiveness of the operation
To prevent slippage Dr._Steffee began to use a plate-and-screw_system similar to that described in the ¡¬290_patent

Dr._Steffee 's first plate-and-screw_system used a long plate with fixed location_screw_holes
Dr._Steffee implanted this type of plate-and-screw_system by drilling or tapping holes into a patient 's vertebrae aligning the vertebral holes with holes in the plate and then attaching the plate with bone_screws
Dr._Steffee typically installed two such plates one on each side of the spine
These systems fixed the vertebrae more rigidly than wire and rod systems
The plates with holes in fixed locations however were difficult to install and adapt *1375 to different patients because the holes were rarely spaced identically to pedicle distances between a patient 's vertebrae

Dr._Steffee thus improved his plate-and-screw_system in 1982 while working at a hospital in Cleveland
He conceived of headless screws that would permit him to first optimally locate such screws in each vertebral pedicle and then attach the spine_plate to the installed screws
Dr._Steffee took his regular bone_screws to the Cleveland Research Institute ( CRI ) hospital machine shop and asked Frank Janson a machinist to cut the heads off of the screws
Without screw heads Dr._Steffee needed to find another means to attach the plate to the screws in the spine
He conceived of using a tapered conical nut from a Hagie pin a pin commonly used by orthopedists to fix broken hips in children

Next Dr._Steffee recognized that he would need to modify the fixed location_screw_holes in the plate to facilitate attachment at different pedical distances between vertebrae
Dr._Steffee looked to another well-known device-a small slotted Egger 's plate which orthopedic surgeons use to fix long bone fractures
Dr._Steffee asked Mr._Janson to make a bigger Egger 's plate to accommodate a spine

Dr._Steffee 's final problem was that the slots in the plate could slide along the screws and defeat proper fixation of the plate to the spine
To solve this problem Dr._Steffee told Mr._Janson that he needed a plate designed so that the Hagie pin nut `` sinks in and stays right there ''
Mr._Janson responded to this instruction by putting nests in the slots
The ¡¬290_patent claims the resulting combination

?
The disclosed spine_plate ( 30 ) has a series of elongated slots ( 52 ) configured with a series of nests or arcuate_recesses ( 116 )
Claim 1 of the ¡¬290_patent recites : An apparatus for use with fasteners for maintaining vertebrae in a desired relationship said apparatus comprising : an elongated plate for connecting at least two vertebrae.. *1376 said elongated plate also having at least one elongated slot extending there through.. said slot being capable of receiving a fastener therein.. and
said slot being defined by opposed_slot_surfaces extending longitudinally of said elongated plate and arcuate_recesses in said opposed_slot_surfaces and spaced there along the recesses in one of said opposed_slot_surfaces being aligned with the recesses in the other of said opposed_slot_surfaces to define said plurality of locations said recesses comprising means for blocking sliding movement of [ s ] aid elongated plate relative to the fastener and of said elongated plate relative to the vertebrae when the fastener is located in a pair of aligned recesses
( emphasis added )

Dr._Steffee also improved the headless bone_screw
The ¡¬311_patent discloses a bone_screw with an elongated shank to e.g. fasten the plate of the ¡¬290_patent to a spine connect broken bones or connect prostheses to bones in any part of the body
The ¡¬311_patent describes the bone_screw as having three identifiable segments : ( 1 ) a first externally threaded portion ( 142 ) for receiving a connecting member such as a nut ; ( 2 ) a cylindrical_body_portion for projecting into and engaging the bone opening surface ( 182 ) ; and ( 3 ) a second threaded portion for attaching the screw to the bone ( 144 )

Bones have a hard outer shell ( called cortical bone ) and a spongy center ( called cancellous bone )
Cancellous bone contains blood vessels
Thus once a hole is drilled or

?
tapped into a bone effluence ( blood and other bodily fluids ) may leak into the hole
This effluence can corrode and weaken the screw
According to the ¡¬ 311 patent the claimed bone_screw has a cylindrical_body_portion and a shoulder portion ( 184 ) that act as a sort of stopper blocking effluence from leaking out of the bone
Claim 5 of the ¡¬311_patent recites : A bone_screw for connecting a bone_portion with a bone connecting member said bone_screw comprising : an elongated shank having a longitudinal central axis a first externally threaded portion for receiving an internally threaded nut and a second externally threaded portion for threaded engagement with a surface defining an opening in the bone_portion to attach the bone_screw to the bone_portion ; and
means integral with said shank and having a transverse cross-section at least equal to the transverse cross-section of the opening in the bone_portion for projecting into the opening and for engaging a portion of the surface defining the opening in the bone_portion to restrict movement of said bone_screw relative to the bone_portion in a direction transverse to the longitudinal *1377 central axis of said shank and to block effluence from the opening in the bone_portion said means being located intermediate said first externally threaded portion and said second externally threaded portion
( emphasis added )

Dr._Steffee and another colleague founded AcroMed in 1983
Dr._Steffee assigned all of his rights in the ¡¬290 and ¡¬311_patent s to AcroMed
In 1988 CRI disbanded and Mr._Janson went to work at AcroMed
When Mr._Janson began working for AcroMed he completed an Employment Agreement requiring him to disclose any pre-existing invention in which he had an interest
Mr._Janson checked the box marked `` Employee has no such property '' and signed that agreement

Mr._Janson worked as a machinist at AcroMed until 1992 and then continued as a consultant for AcroMed until June 1994
In June 1994 Mr._Janson met with Danek 's counsel on two occasions
Later that year AcroMed requested Mr._Janson to sign a declaration and power of attorney to add him as a co-inventor of the ¡¬290_patent
AcroMed also requested Mr._Janson to assign his rights in the ¡¬290_patent if he signed the declaration
Mr._Janson declined to sign either the declaration or the assignment
Instead on January 25 1995 Mr._Janson signed an agreement with Danek to assign his `` patent rights '' to Danek for $ 150,000

AcroMed first sued Danek for infringement of the ¡¬290_patent by Danek 's `` Luque '' system in 1988
The Luque was a semi-constrained plate-and-screw_system without a way to hold the screws completely rigid to the plate
In March 1989 the parties entered a settlement agreement whereby AcroMed granted Danek a limited license under the ¡¬290_patent
In return Danek paid AcroMed a license fee until 1996

In 1992 Danek changed its technology into a constrained system
Danek developed several constrained systems including the `` DYNA-LOK '' and `` Z-PLATE '' systems
In June 1993 AcroMed again filed suit claiming that Danek 's DYNA-LOK Z-PLATE and various other spine_plate systems infringe the ¡¬311 and ¡¬ 290 patents
Danek counterclaimed that AcroMed 's ¡¬290_patent is invalid for failure to name Mr._Janson as an inventor
Danek further counterclaimed that AcroMed 's ¡¬311_patent is invalid due to anticipation by United States Patent No._3554,193 to Ilias Konstantinou ( Konstantinou_patent )

As depicted below the Konstantinou_patent discloses a hip-pinning device for repair of hip fractures
The device uses a lag_screw to attach a bone_plate to the upper region of a femur
The lag_screw has a rounded head portion ( 38 ) that permits the screw to be angularly displaced within a hole in a bone_plate
A surgeon can thus vary the angle at which he attaches the screw to the bone while maintaining the plate in a desired location

*1378. ?
After a ten-day jury trial the district_court judge granted AcroMed 's motion for JMOL that the ¡¬290_patent was not invalid for improper_inventorship
The jury returned a verdict that Danek 's DYNA-LOK and Z-PLATE spine_plates infringed the asserted claims of the ¡¬290_patent
The jury further found that Danek 's DYNA-LOK and Z-PLATE 5.5 mm bone bolts infringed claims 5 10 14 and 16 of the ¡¬311_patent and that Danek 's DYNA-LOK and Z-PLATE larger diameter bone bolts infringed claims 5 10 12 13 14 and 16
The jury additionally found all asserted claims of both the ¡¬290 and ¡¬311_patent to be neither anticipated nor obvious over prior_art
The jury awarded AcroMed $ 32,913,444 in damages and found that Danek had willfully infringed the ¡¬290_patent

After the jury_verdict Danek renewed its motions for JMOL that the ¡¬290_patent is invalid for omitting an inventor that its spine_plates and screws do not infringe the ¡¬311_patent and that the Konstantinou_patent anticipates the ¡¬311_patent
The district_court denied all of these motions
The district_court then increased the damages to $ 47,806,701 to account for post-verdict damages and prejudgment interest
Danek appealed
This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
