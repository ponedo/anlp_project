United States Court of Appeals Federal_Circuit
DOME PATENT L.P. Plaintiff-Appellant
v. Michelle K. LEE Director U.S._Patent and Trademark_Office Defendant-Appellee
No._2014-1673
| Sept._3,_2015
Synopsis
Background : Patentee brought action seeking judicial review of Patent and Trademark_Office 's ( PTO ) reexamination decision canceling as obvious a patent_claim disclosing a method of making a contact_lens with increased oxygen_permeability
The United_States_District_Court for the District of Columbia Paul L. Friedman J. held that claim was invalid for obviousness
Patentee appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Federal_Circuit Hughes Circuit_Judge held that :

PTO was required to show by a preponderance of the evidence that under ex parte_reexamination the patent_claim was shown to be obvious ;

patent_claim disclosed motivation to combine prior_art and thus was invalid for obviousness ;

a person of ordinary_skill would not have been dissuaded from combining prior_art and thus prior_art did not teach away from combining elements of claim ; and

PTO did not improperly shift burden onto patentee to prove nonobvious-ness once PTO established prima facie case of obviousness

Opinion
HUGHES Circuit_Judge
Dome owns a patent for making contact-lens material
On reexamination the U.S._Patent and Trademark_Office found that the claimed method at issue was obvious and therefore unpatentable
The district_court agreed with the Patent_Office that *1375 the claimed method was unpatentable
On appeal Dome challenges both the standard of review employed by the district_court and the court 's ultimate conclusion on obviousness
Because we conclude that the district_court applied the proper legal standard and because its factual findings were not clearly erroneous we affirm

I. Dome owns U.S._Patent No._4306,042 which concerns the polymer_science behind making contact-lens_materials that are rigid and gas permeable
During the relevant time period contact-lens_makers required contact-lens_materials to be optically clear sufficiently rigid for machining and polishing oxygen permeable and hydrophilic
To meet these four requirements contact-lens_makers used plastic polymers

A polymer is a chain or network of molecules called monomers
The process of synthesizing a polymer from monomers of a single type is called polymerization
When two or more different types of monomers are reacted i.e. copolymerized a copolymer is formed and the constituent compounds are known as comonomers
Polymers or copolymers can have many different structures including linear chains branched chains cross-linked networks and mixtures thereof

Contact-lens_makers can produce materials that have varying physical properties by varying the types of monomers used and the resulting polymer 's structure
For example using one type of cross-linking agent over another may increase the gaps in a polymer 's structure affecting oxygen_permeability
Or using hydrophilic_monomers sometimes referred to as `` wetting agents '' in a linear polymer chain can increase the polymer 's ability to attract or hold water
By contrast using hydrophobic monomers to create a polymer can decrease the polymer 's affinity for water

The first practical plastic contact_lens was made of plexiglass or polymethyl methacrylate ( PMMA )
Although clear rigid and hydrophilic PMMA was not sufficiently oxygen permeable to allow users to wear the lenses for extended periods of time
After a few hours a user had to remove PMMA_lenses to allow the cornea to absorb ambient oxygen which is needed to ensure among other_things that the eye 's cells and nerves remain healthy
Given these limitations on PMMA_lenses polymer_scientists began exploring other combinations of monomer types and polymer structures to create a material similar to PMMA but with increased oxygen_permeability

In the early 1970 's major advances in polymer_science led to the discovery that silicone could be incorporated into plastics by mixing siloxane-based compounds with methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) a monomer in PMMA
One particular siloxane-based compound known as `` Tris '' or 1 1 1-tris ( trimethylsiloxy ) methacryloxypropylsilane was identified as a strong candidate because when mixed with MMA it led to materials with exceptional oxygen_permeability
A significant drawback to this combination however was that Tris is hydrophobic and it caused the polymer to be hydrophobic
To offset this drawback polymer_scientists in the late 1970 's and the 1980 's would combine other hydrophilic comonomers wetting agents and cross-linking agents with Tris hoping to strike an acceptable balance between oxygen_permeability optical clarity rigidity and hydrophilicity

Claim 1 of the ¡¬042_patent covers a method of making one such combination
*1376 The method comprises making Tris and then copolymerizing it with an ester of acrylic or methacrylic_acid ( e.g. MMA ) a surface wetting agent and an oxygen permeable siloxane-based cross-linking agent ( a multifunctional1 siloxanyl alkyl ester )
Claim 1 recites in relevant part :

A method of making an oxygen permeable material for the manufacture of contact_lens by the synthesization of the monomer 1 1 1-tris ( methylsiloxy ) methacryloxypropylsilane
( a siloxanyl alkyl ester ) by the following procedures :.. ( f ) forming an oxygen permeable contact_lens material by copolymerizing from 5 % to 90 % by weight of the 1 1 1-tris ( trimethylsiloxy ) methacryloxypropylsilane prepared above ; 3 % to 90 % by weight of an ester of acrylic or methacrylic_acid ; from 0.05 % to 90 % by weight of a surface wetting agent from 0.01 % to 90 % by weight of an oxygen permeable crosslinking agent selected from the class of multifunctional siloxanyl alkyl esters in the presence of a free radical or a photo initiator
¡¬042_patent col. 5_ll._38 -64
In December 1997 Dome filed suit against six makers of contact_lenses for alleged infringement of the ¡¬042_patent
Shortly after one defendant requested ex parte_reexamination of the ¡¬042_patent
See35 U.S.C.¡± 302 ( 1994 )
In June 1999 the Patent_Office ordered reexamination and as a result the district_court stayed litigation pending a final determination in the reexamination proceeding
The Patent_Office confirmed the patentability of claims 2 3 and 4 of the ¡¬042_patent but it found claim 1 obvious under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103 ( a ) ( 2006 )

Dome then filed suit in September 2007 against the Patent_Office in the United_States_District_Court for the District of Columbia under 35 U.S.C.¡±¡± 145_and_306_(2006) requesting that the district_court enjoin the Patent_Office from cancelling claim 1 of the ¡¬042_patent and that it direct the Patent_Office to issue a reexamination certificate under 35 U.S.C.¡± 307 ( 2006 )
Following a bench trial the district_court held claim 1 of the ¡¬042_patent invalid as obvious under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103 and entered judgment in favor of the Patent_Office

The district_court concluded that the ¡¬042_patent would have been obvious to a person of ordinary_skill at the time of filing in view of the prior_art including U.S._Patent Nos._4120,570 ( Gaylord ) 4,152,508 ( Ellis ) and 4,235,985 ( Tanaka )

Gaylord discloses a polymer for making rigid gas-permeable contact_lenses
Gaylord 's disclosures represent a significant breakthrough in contact-lens_materials
It is one of the first teachings of using siloxane-based monomers including Tris with MMA for the purpose of making contact_lenses
In fact the record indicates that Tris and similar siloxane-based compounds became an `` industry standard '' in the manufacture of contact_lenses following this breakthrough
J.A.2085

Gaylord teaches that a suitable polymer can be made by combining Tris MMA methacrylic_acid as a hydrophilic_wetting_agent and a hydrophilic cross-linking agent such as ethylene_glycol dimethacrylate
*1377See Gaylord_col. 1 l.53-col. 2 l.44 ; col. 3_ll._63 -65 ; col. 5_ll._39 -51 ; col. 6_ll._3 -12
But unlike the ¡¬042_patent Gaylord does not teach using a hydrophobic siloxane-based cross-linking agent
See Gaylord_col. 6_ll._3 -12

Ellis discloses a `` silicone-containing hard contact_lens material '' that like Gaylord can include Tris MMA a hydrophilic_wetting_agent and a hydrophilic cross-linking agent including ethylene_glycol dimethacrylate
Ellis_col. 1_ll._1 -3 ; col. 3_ll._7 -24 ; col. 3_ll._64 -68 ; col. 4_ll._24 -27 ; col. 4_ll._4 -7
Ellis also teaches the inclusion of a fifth monomer called an itaconate ester which `` gives increased rigidity hardness and some degree of wettability ''
Ellis_col. 2_ll._1 -3

Tanaka discloses a polymer suitable for continuous-wear contact_lenses and it teaches using a variety of cross-linking agents
Like Gaylord and Ellis Tanaka teaches using a hydrophilic compound including ethylene_glycol dimethacrylate as a cross-linking agent
Tanaka_col. 8_ll._2 -6
But Tanaka also teaches among other_things that using hydrophobic siloxane-based compounds are preferably employed as cross-linking agents because of their ability to enhance oxygen_permeability in the resulting polymer
Tanaka_col. 8_ll._10 -46

Tanaka differs from Gaylord in that rather than using Tris Tanaka teaches using a different siloxane-based monomer containing both hydrophobic alkylsiloxy ester groups ( siloxane-based groups ) and internal hydrophilic glycerol or polyether groups
See Tanaka_col. 2 l.64-col. 3 l.5
Tanaka teaches that this replacement for Tris-type_monomers can be combined with MMA
See Tanaka_col. 2 l.64-col. 3 l.5 ; col. 7 ll.39-41
According to Tanaka this approach is more effective than using Tris-type_monomers because simply offsetting the hydrophobic properties of Tris by copolymerizing it with hydrophilic_monomers can lead to an `` opaque '' product `` a fatal defect for use as contact_lens_materials
Therefore the polymerization ratio of the hydrophilic monomer to the [ Tris-type ] monomer is limited to produce a transparent copolymer.. '' Tanaka_col. 3_ll._35 -40 ; see also Tanaka_col. 3_ll._6 -34
Tanaka suggests that alternatively one might reduce the number of siloxane-based molecules in the polymer to reduce hydrophobicity but then the oxygen_permeability of the resulting polymer becomes too low
Tanaka_col. 3_ll._41 -45
Tanaka explains that `` [ i ] n any case there can not be obtained a polymer suited for preparing a contact_lens which can be comfortably worn continuously for a long period of time '' when Tris-type_monomers are employed
Tanaka_col. 3_ll._48 -51

In the district_court action Dome did not dispute that the prior_art disclosed the compounds recited in claim 1 of the ¡¬042_patent
The district_court found that a person of ordinary_skill would have been motivated to combine the prior_art and that the prior_art did not teach away from the claimed invention notwithstanding the disclosures in Tanaka regarding Tris-type_monomers
Additionally the court found that Dome 's proffered evidence of objective indicia did not indicate nonobviousness
Accordingly the court agreed with the Board 's conclusion that claim 1 is unpatentable as obvious under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103
Dome appeals
We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 4 ) ( C )
