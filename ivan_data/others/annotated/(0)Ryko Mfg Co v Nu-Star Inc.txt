Opinion
EDWARD S. SMITH Senior_Circuit_Judge
Ryko Manufacturing Co. ( Ryko ) sued Nu-Star Inc. ( Nu-Star ) for infringing its reissue patent Re
32,601 ( ¡¬601 )
The United_States_District_Court for the District of Minnesota granted Nu-Star 's motion for summary_judgment based on invalidity determining that the patented invention would have been obvious in light of the prior_art
Ryko_appeals and we affirm

Facts
Conventional automatic car washes were activated by mechanical insertion devices
These devices activated the carwash system by permitting electrical current to flow through the system when an appropriate article such as a coin token credit card or receipt was inserted into the device
The device required much maintenance because the mechanical hardware could cause problems or the device could become congested with too many inserted articles

Many attempts were made to solve these problems and a solution was discovered when Klein invented the device disclosed in reissue patent ¡¬601 which was assigned to Ryko
The ¡¬601_patent discloses a combination comprising an automatic_car_wash_system electronically activated by an electrical numerical keypad device

Nu-Star also sells an automatic_car_wash_system which utilizes an electronic keypad activation device
Ryko sued Nu-Star for infringing claim seven of its patent
Nu-Star countered with its motion for summary_judgment

After considering all the primary_considerations enumerated in Graham v. John Deere,1 the district_court found that utilization of the numerical keypad device to electronically activate an automatic_car_wash_system was a combination invention that was clearly suggested by the prior_art
Therefore the district_court determined that at the time the invention was made it would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art
The district_court found that the secondary considerations purportedly weighed in favor of nonobviousness but were not sufficiently influential to override the finding of obviousness compelled by the primary_considerations

Accordingly the district_court granted Nu-Star 's motion for summary_judgment
Ryko_appeals to this Court asserting various errors in the district_court 's rationale
