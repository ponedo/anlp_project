Wake_Forest_University_Health_Sciences Plaintiff-Appellant v. SMITH & NEPHEW INC. Defendant-Appellee
No._2011-1105
| Aug._13,_2012
Synopsis
Background : Patentee filed action against competitor alleging infringement of patents on apparatus and method of treating tissue_damage by applying negative or reduced_pressure to wound over area sufficient to promote migration of epithelial and subcutaneous_tissue toward wound and for time_period sufficient to facilitate closure of wound
The United States District Court for the Western District of Texas W. Royal Furgeson Jr. J. granted judgment as matter of law ( JMOL ) of invalidity for obviousness
Patentee appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals O'Malley Circuit_Judge held that :

district_court was required to accept all implicit factual findings supporting jury 's conclusion with respect to ultimate conclusion of nonobviousness that were supported by substantial_evidence ;

substantial_evidence supported finding that prior_art_references did not disclose treating wounds with negative_pressure as required by patents ;

court had to assume that jury found patentee 's expert to be credible and persuasive in his opinion that prior_art reference did not disclose use of negative_pressure to heal wounds as patents did ;

court had to defer to factual finding by jury that there was no reason to combine prior_art_references ;

substantial_evidence supported jury 's findings of objective indicia of nonobviousness ; and

competitor did not show that patents were obvious

Reversed and remanded

Dyk Circuit_Judge filed concurring opinion

Wake_Forest_University_Health_Sciences ( `` Wake_Forest '' ) appeals the district_court 's grant of judgment as a matter of law ( `` JMOL '' ) of invalidity for obviousness
In granting Smith & Nephew Inc. 's ( `` S & N '' ) motion for JMOL the district_court overturned the jury 's determination that S & N had failed to prove that the asserted claims of the patents in suit were obvious
We conclude that on the basis of the jury 's factual findings S & N failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that the claims were obvious
Accordingly we reverse and remand.1

BACKGROUND
I
Asserted Patents
Kinetic_Concepts Inc. KCI_Licensing Inc. KCI_USA Inc. KCI_Medical_Resources KCI_Manufacturing and Medical_Holdings_Limited ( collectively `` KCI '' ) and Wake_Forest brought suit against S & N alleging infringement of U.S. Patent Nos._7216,651 ( `` ¡¬651_patent `` ) and 5,645,081 ( `` ¡¬081_patent `` )
Wake_Forest is the owner of the asserted patents and KCI are the exclusive licensees of the patents
Both patents claim methods and apparatuses for treating difficult-to-heal wounds by applying suction or negative_pressure e.g. ¡¬651_patent Abstract ; ¡¬081_patent Abstract
Wake_Forest and KCI asserted that S & N infringes apparatus claims 2_and_5 of the ¡¬081_patent and induces infringement of method claims 42 109 116 and 121 of the ¡¬651_patent

As described by the asserted patents medical `` treatment of open wounds that are too large to spontaneously close '' is difficult
¡¬081_patent col.1 ll.11-12 ; ¡¬651_patent col.1 ll.29-30
`` Wound closure requires that epithelial and subcutaneous_tissue migrate from the wound border toward the wound ''
¡¬081_patent col.2 ll.49-50
To facilitate such migration doctors commonly use mechanical closures such as sutures or staples
Id.at_col.l 11.24-25
Such mechanical closures create tension on the skin which encourages epithelial migration
Id.at_col.l 11.25-28
`` While suturing and stapling of wounds is widely practiced it has a major drawback : the tensile force required to achieve closure with sutures or staples causes very high localized stresses at the suture insertion points resulting in the rupture of the tissue at these points ''
Id.at_col.l 11.28-33
This rupturing inhibits healing of the wound
Id.at_col.l 11.33-35
Additionally it is not feasible to suture some large open wounds
Id.at col.1 ll.28-33

To address these shortcomings the invention applies `` negative_pressure to a wound over an area sufficient to promote migration of epithelial and subcutaneous_tissue toward the wound with the negative_pressure being maintained for a time sufficient to facilitate closure of the wound ''
Id.at col.2 ll.45-49 ; ¡¬651_patent col.4 ll.18-23 ( `` [ A ] method of treating tissue_damage is provided which comprises applying a negative or reduced_pressure to a wound over an area sufficient to promote the migration of epithelial and subcutaneous_tissue toward the wound and for a time_period sufficient to facilitate closure of the wound `` )
Claim 2 of the ¡¬081_patent and claim 42 of the ¡¬651_patent are illustrative : 2
An apparatus for facilitating the healing of wounds comprising : *1347 vacuum_means for creating a negative_pressure between about 0.BIG_TOKEN__1_and_0__BIG_TOKEN99 atmospheres on the area of skin including and surrounding the wound ; sealing means operatively associated with said vacuum_means for maintaining said negative_pressure on said wound by contacting the skin surrounding said wound ; and
open-cell polymer for positioning at the wound within the sealing means for preventing the over-growth of tissue in the wound
¡¬081_patent col.9 ll.50-65
42
A method of treating a wound comprising the steps of : i. providing a vacuum_source capable of providing at least 0.11 atm of reduced_pressure ; ii
locating a flexible adhesive cover over the wound said cover having a suction_port ; iii
locating a porous material comprising a synthetic polymer under said cover at the wound ; iv
adhesively sealing and adhering the periphery of said cover to tissue surrounding the wound to form a continuous seal ; v. operably connecting said suction_port with said vacuum system for producing said reduced_pressure ; vi
interposing a fluid trap between said suction_port and said vacuum_source ; and vii
maintaining reduced_pressure of at least 0.11 atm at the wound until the wound had progressed toward a selected stage of healing
¡¬651_patent col.25 ll.31-48

Figure 1 of the ¡¬651_patent discloses the key components of the claimed apparatus :

?
*1348 As depicted in this figure the claimed apparatus includes : ( 1 ) a vacuum_pump ( 30 ) ; ( 2 ) tubing ( 12 ) ; ( 3 ) an open-celled foam wound screen ( 10 ) ; and ( 4 ) an adhesive_seal ( 18 )
¡¬651_patent col.6 ll.31-61 ; see also ¡¬081_patent col.2 ll.30-35 ( `` FIG._1 shows a cross-sectional view of a negative_pressure device comprising a open-cell polymer screen a flexible hose connecting the foam section to a suction pump and a flexible polymer sheet overlying the foam-hose assembly to provide the necessary seal `` )
To utilize the apparatus `` [ f ] irst the open cell foam is cut to fit the shape of the wound and placed inside the wound
Then the adhesive_seal is placed over the foam that is inside the wound ''
Kinetic_Concepts Inc. v. Blue Sky Med
Grp. Inc. No._08- cv-102 slip op.at 2 ( W.D.Tex
Oct._10,_2010 ) ( order granting defendant 's motion for judgment as a matter of law of invalidity for obviousness ) ( ECF No._605 ) ( `` JMOL Order `` )
Once the seal is in place `` [ o ] ne end of the tubing is placed through the seal into the foam and the other end is attached to the vacuum_pump
The vacuum_pump is turned on and because of the tight seal around the wound the edges of the wound immediately begin to move together ''

Prior Art
In the present litigation S & N asserted prior_art that generally falls into three primary categories : ( 1 ) the Bagautdinov references ; ( 2 ) the Zamierowski reference ; and ( 3 ) the Chariker-Jeter references
On appeal there is no dispute that these references are all prior_art
