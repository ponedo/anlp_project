Opinion
Reyna Circuit_Judge
This case is about disavowal of claim scope
The specification and prosecution history of Poly-America L.P. 's ( `` Poly-America '' ) U.S. Patent No._8702,308 ( `` '308_patent `` ) contain clear and unequivocal statements that the inventor intended to limit the claimed invention to a trash_bag with `` short_seals '' at its upper_corners that extend inwardly to narrow the bag 's upper_opening
In light of the inventor 's disavowal the district court correctly construed the term `` short_seal '' to require that such seals extend inwardly
We therefore affirm

*1133 I
BACKGROUND
A. Patented Technology
The '308_patent is `` directed toward an improved construction of an elastic drawstring trash_bag ''
'308_patent col. 3_ll._46 -47

?
Id
fig._1
The claimed apparatus is made from two `` panels '' of polymeric material joined at the sides and the bottom to form an enclosed bag
At the bottom the panels are joined by a `` bottom fold ''
At the top a piece of each panel is folded over and sealed to form a `` hem ''
Inside each hem is a drawstring
See id
col. 3_ll._46 -54

The patent identifies two different seals located along the sides of the bag
The long seals along the length of the panels are referred to as `` side seals ''
Id
col. 4_ll._66 -67
The small seals in the upper_corners of the bag are referred to as `` short_seals ''
Id
col. 5_ll._25 -30
The short_seals bind together each panel 's hem and the ends of the drawstrings located therein
Id

A principal feature of the claimed invention is Poly-America 's use of inwardly extended_short_seals to reduce the width of the trash_bag 's upper_opening
When coupled with elastic_drawstrings the narrowed opening allows those drawstrings to wrap around the rim of a trash_receptacle more securely than prior_art_trash_bags that do not have a narrowed upper_opening
See id
col. 6_l._32 -col. 7_l._19

Throughout its written description the '308_patent indicates the significance of the extended short_seal feature and the reduced upper_opening_width the extended_short_seals provide
To start the title of the invention is `` Reduced Opening Elastic Drawstring Bag ''
The Abstract explains that : *1134 [ w ] hen the bag of the present_invention is in a relaxed_state the reduced upper_opening_width of the elastic_drawstring_bag is therefore less than bag proper width allowing a consumer to pull the elastic_drawstring_bag over the lip of a trash_receptacle and allowing the elastic_drawstrings to snugly fit around the trashcan
The Background of the Invention section explains that prior_art_trash_bags do not have extended_short_seals and can be difficult to secure over the lip of a trash_receptacle
Id
col. 2_ll._15 -54
The Summary of the Invention states that : `` Embodiments of the elastic_drawstring_bag contemplated by the present_invention have an upper_opening with a width that is less than 97 % of the width of the rest of the bag ( by virtue of the extended_short_seals ) ''
Id
col. 4_ll._4 -7
Of the five figures in the '308_patent the only figure that does not reveal a reduced upper_opening by virtue of extended_short_seals is the figure that depicts prior art drawstring bags
Id
figs
1-5

The written description reiterates that the use of extended_short_seals to reduce the width of the bag 's upper_opening is an improvement upon prior_art_trash_bags
Id
col. 5_ll._46 -57
It also identifies the use of extended_short_seals to create a reduced width upper_opening as `` one of the characteristics of the present_invention '' : In looking at both FIG._1 and FIG._2 it is important to note that one of the characteristics of the present_invention is a reduction in the upper width ( when the bag is in a relaxed_state ) of the bag resulting from the extended_short_seals
