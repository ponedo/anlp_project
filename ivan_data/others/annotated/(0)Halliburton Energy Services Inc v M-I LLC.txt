Halliburton_Energy_Services Inc. ( `` Halliburton '' ) appeals from a final_judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Texas
Halliburton_Energy_Services Inc. v. M-I_LLC No._6 :05-CV-155 ( E.D.Tex
Nov._20,_2006 ) ( `` Judgment Order '' )
The district_court granted summary_judgment in favor of M-I_LLC ( `` M-I '' ) holding that independent_claims 1-BIG_TOKEN__3_and_5__BIG_TOKEN and their asserted dependent_claims of U.S. Patent No._6887,832 B2 ( `` the ¡¬ 832 patent '' ) were invalid as indefinite under 35 U.S.C.¡± 112 ?

We heard oral argument on November 7 2007
Because a claim term in each asserted claim lacked clear meaning to the ordinary artisan we affirm

I. Halliburton is the assignee of the ¡¬832_patent which relates to oil_field_drilling_fluids that are fragile_gels
In the process of drilling such wells drilling_fluid is used for a variety of purposes such as `` removing drill cuttings from the wellbore cooling and lubricating the drill bit aiding in support of the drill pipe and drill bit and providing a hydrostatic head to maintain the integrity of the wellbore walls and prevent well blowouts ''
¡¬ 832 patent col.1 II.27-31

The ¡¬832_patent claims recite certain fragile_gel drilling_fluids
Claim 1 for example recites : 1
A method for conducting a drilling operation in a subterranean formation using a fragile_gel drilling_fluid comprising : ( a ) an invert emulsion base ; ( b ) one or more thinners ; ( c ) one or more emulsifiers ; and
( d ) one or more weighting agents wherein said operation includes running casing in a borehole
( emphasis added )

During prosecution Halliburton distinguished the claims of the ¡¬832_patent from prior_art_fluids by stating that the claims were `` limited to '' a `` fragile_gel '' drilling_fluid or the method of using a `` fragile_gel '' drilling_fluid
Thus although the term `` fragile_gel '' appears only in the preamble of the asserted independent_claims Halliburton concedes that the claimed drilling_fluids are limited to those that are `` fragile_gels ''
Pitney Bowes Inc. v. Hewlett-Packard Co. 182_F.3d_1298 1305 ( Fed.Cir.1999 ) ( `` If the claim_preamble when read in the context of the entire claim recites limitations of the claim or if the claim_preamble is 'necessary to give life meaning and vitality ' to the claim then the claim_preamble should be construed as if in the balance of the claim '' )
( citations omitted )
The specification defines `` fragile_gels '' as follows : A `` fragile_gel '' as used herein is a `` gel '' that is easily disrupted or thinned and that liquifies or becomes less_gel-like and more liquid-like under stress such as caused by moving the fluid but which quickly returns to a gel when the movement or other stress is alleviated or removed such as when circulation of the fluid is stopped as for example when drilling is stopped
The `` fragileness '' of the `` fragile_gels '' of the present invention contributes to the unique and surprising *1247 behavior and advantages of the present invention
The gels are so `` fragile '' that it is believed that they may be disrupted by a mere pressure wave or a compression wave during drilling
They seem to break instantaneously when disturbed reversing from a gel back into a liquid form with minimum_pressure force and time and with less pressure force and time than known to be required to convert prior_art_fluids from a gel-like state into a flowable state
¡¬832_patent col.2 II.26-42

In May 2005 Halliburton sued M-I in the United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Texas alleging that M-I 's Rheliant drilling mud system infringed certain claims of the ¡¬832_patent
M-I moved for summary_judgment of invalidity arguing that the asserted claims of the ¡¬832_patent were invalid for indefiniteness lack of enablement and/or lack of written description
After holding a combined Markman and motion hearing to address claim construction disputes as well as M-I 's motion for summary_judgment of invalidity the district_court granted M-I 's motion for summary_judgment finding that all asserted claims of the ¡¬832_patent were invalid as indefinite
Halliburton Energy Serv. Inc. v. M-I_LLC 456_F.Supp.2d_811 825 ( E.D.Tex.2006 )

First the district_court looked at the definition of fragile_gel in the specification and found that it was too subjective and unclear because it relied on terms such as `` easily transitions '' `` easily disrupted or thinned '' `` less_gel-like '' `` more liquid-like '' `` quickly returns to a gel '' `` break instantaneously '' and `` minimum_pressure force and time ''
Id.at 817
Additionally the district_court rejected Halliburton 's argument that Figure 3 ( depicted below ) and Figure 41 of the ¡¬832_patent distinguish the invention from the prior art
Id.at 822-23

*1248. ?
FIG._3
SF fluids are prior_art_fluids whereas ACCOLADE ( tm ) fluids have the characteristics of the invention of the ¡¬832_patent
¡¬832_patent col.4 I.65-col.5 I.7
In Figure 3 at around the 70 minute mark the height of the curve when stress is applied represents the strength of the gel that the fluid forms at rest and the speed at which the curve falls back on itself indicates how quickly the gel breaks ( i.e. transitions back to a liquid state )
The district_court found that this graph did not delineate the bounds of the invention because both prior_art_fluids and fluids of the invention exhibit the same shape curves ( the curves of the 12.1 SF 12.65 ACCOLADE and 15.6 ACCOLADE fluids all fall directly back on themselves )
Halliburton 456 F.Supp.2d at 820
The primary difference between these fluids is the height of the curves ( i.e. the strength of the gels formed ) but the district_court found that Halliburton had produced no evidence of `` precisely how high the vertical leg of a fluid 's L-shaped curve must reach-i.e. how 'strong ' a gel must be-for that fluid to exhibit 'fragile_gel behavior '
`` Id

The district_court also noted that Halliburton 's proposed additional limitation to the term `` fragile_gel '' that it contains no or only low amounts of organophilic_clay or lignite was improperly imported from the specification which states that the fragile_gel of certain embodiments of the invention of the patent preferably does not have these clays
Id.at 824
The court found that the doctrine of claim differentiation further counseled against this construction because dependent_claims added the limitation that the fluid is `` substantially free of organophilic_clay ''
Id.at 824-25

In November 2006 the court issued a final_judgment that all asserted claims of the ¡¬832_patent were proven invalid as indefinite held that all other issues of infringement and validity were moot and dismissed M-I 's counterclaims without prejudice
This timely appeal followed
We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
