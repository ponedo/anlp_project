Nos._2008-1404 2008-1405 2008-1406
| May_13,_2009
Synopsis
Background : Owner of patent claiming compound_risedronate the active_ingredient of an osteoporosis drug brought infringement action against competitor
The United_States_District_Court for the District of Delaware Joseph J. Farnan Jr. J. 536_F.Supp.2d_476 in a bench_trial entered judgment in favor of patent owner
Competitor appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Huff District_Judge sitting by designation held that :

district_court did not clearly err in finding that competitor failed to establish prima facie case of obviousness ;

district_court did not commit clear error in concluding that secondary_considerations supported a finding of non-obviousness of patent claiming risedronate ;

patent claiming an intermittent_dosing_method for treating osteoporosis qualified as prior art ; and

patent claiming risedronate was not invalid based on obviousness-type_double_patenting

Affirmed

Opinion
HUFF District_Judge
Teva_Pharmaceuticals_USA Inc. ( `` Teva '' ) appeals from a final judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the District of Delaware in favor of The Procter & Gamble Company ( `` P & G '' ) in three cases upholding the validity of P & G 's U.S._Patent 5,583,122 ( the `` ¡¬122_patent `` )
Procter & Gamble Co. v. Teva_Pharmaceuticals_USA Inc. 536_F.Supp.2d_476 ( D.Del.2008 )
After a bench_trial and a stipulation for judgment in the related cases the district_court rejected Teva 's invalidity defenses of obviousness and obviousness-type_double_patenting
We affirm

BACKGROUND
The ¡¬122_patent claims the compound_risedronate the active_ingredient of P & G 's osteoporosis drug ActonelTHE_R
In August 2004 P & G sued Teva for infringement of the ¡¬122_patent after Teva notified P & G that it planned to market risedronate as a generic equivalent of ActonelTHE_R
Specifically P & G alleged that Teva 's proposed drug infringed claim 4 of the ¡¬122_patent for the compound_risedronate claim 16 for pharmaceutical compositions containing risedronate and claim 23 for methods of treating diseases using risedronate
In its defense Teva argued that the ¡¬ *993 122 patent was invalid as obvious in light of P & G 's expired U.S._Patent 4,761,406 ( the `` ¡¬406_patent `` ) filed on June_6,_1985 and issued on August 2 1988
Alternately Teva argues that the ¡¬122_patent is invalid for obviousness-type_double_patenting

Risedronate the subject of the contested claims is a member of a group of compounds referred to as bisphosphonates
Bisphosphonates in general are active in inhibiting bone resorption
The first two promising bisphosphonates studied for the treatment of metabolic bone diseases etidronate ( EHDP ) and clodronate had clinical problems which prevented their commercialization
P & G conducted a significant amount of experimentation involving hundreds of different bisphosphonate compounds but could not predict the efficacy or toxicity of the new compounds
Eventually researchers at P & G identified risedronate as a promising drug candidate

On December 6 1985 risedronate 's inventors applied for a patent on the compound
P & G is the owner by assignment of the ¡¬122_patent entitled `` Pharmaceutical Compositions Containing Geminal Diphosphonates '' which issued on December 10 1996

Risedronate is neither claimed nor disclosed in the ¡¬406_patent
Instead the ¡¬406_patent entitled `` Regimen for Treating Osteoporosis '' claims an intermittent_dosing_method for treating osteoporosis
As the trial court noted the ¡¬406_patent `` addresses the central problem seen in bisphosphonates at the time namely that they inhibited bone mineralization by teaching the use of a cyclic administrative regimen to achieve a separation of the benign effect of anti-resorption from the unwanted side effect of anti-mineralization in patients ''
Procter & Gamble 536 F.Supp.2d at 492
The ¡¬ 406 patent lists thirty-six polyphosphonate molecules as treatment candidates and eight preferred compounds for intermittent dosing including 2-pyr EHDP
Teva contends that the structural similarities between risedronate and 2-pyr EHDP render the challenged claims of the ¡¬122_patent obvious

From the testimony at trial the district_court concluded that the ¡¬ 406 patent would not have led a person of ordinary_skill in the art to identify 2-pyr EHDP as the lead compound
In light of the extremely unpredictable nature of bisphosphonates at the time of the invention the district_court also found that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would not have been motivated to make the specific molecular modifications to make risedronate
The district_court concluded that unexpected results of risedronate 's potency and toxicity rebut a claim of obviousness
The district_court found that secondary_considerations of non-obviousness supported its conclusions
Similarly the court found that the ¡¬122_patent was not invalid for obviousness-type_double_patenting
This consolidated appeal followed
We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
