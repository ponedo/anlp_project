No._2007-1280

Synopsis
Background : Pharmaceutical company brought action for infringement of patent that claimed range of defined low molecular_weight heparin ( LMWH ) mixtures and its replacement
The district_court 390_F.Supp.2d_936 granted summary judgment in favor of competitors based on finding that patents were unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct
The Court of Appeals 176_Fed.Appx._117 reversed and remanded
On remand the United States District Court for the Central District of California Mariana R. Pfaelzer Senior District Judge 475_F.Supp.2d_970 granted judgment for competitors after bench trial on inequitable_conduct claim
Company appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Prost Circuit_Judge held that :

applicant 's failure to disclose dosage_information evidenced intent to deceive examiner to extent that such information intended to address anticipation rejection ;

any error by court in concluding that anticipation was still at issue in third office action did not diminish prior evidence of intent to deceive ;

evidence of industry practice of clinically-relevant doses could be excluded as irrelevant to reasonableness of applicant 's alleged material_intentional_withholding of particular dosage_information through concealment ;

exculpatory testimony of applicant could be outweighed by other evidence of applicant 's deceptive intent ;

disclosure of half-life data at other doses for compound that was provided to examiner in very misleading way did not diminish applicant 's material_intentional_withholding of dosage_information through concealment ; and

inadvertent errors that applicant made during prosecution of application for patent did not diminish applicant 's material_intentional_withholding of dosage_information through concealment

Affirmed

Rader Circuit_Judge filed dissenting opinion

Before RADER PROST and MOORE Circuit_Judges
Opinion
PROST Circuit_Judge
This infringement case returns to us for the second time after remand to the district_court on the issue of whether Aventis committed inequitable_conduct before the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( `` PTO '' )
In our earlier opinion we held that the dosage of the prior art composition used in half-life comparisons with the patented composition was information material to patentability but we remanded to the district_court to determine whether there was an intent to deceive by Aventis in failing to disclose the dosage
After a trial on the matter the district_court found that there was intent to deceive and held the patents unenforceable for inequitable_conduct
Because we find no abuse of discretion by the district_court in its holding of inequitable_conduct we affirm

I. Aventis is the owner of U.S. Patent No
RE 38,743 ( `` the ¡¬743_patent `` ) and U.S. Patent No._5389,618 ( `` the ¡¬618_patent `` ) which was surrendered upon the issuance of the ¡¬743_Patent
The patents are directed to a composition comprising low molecular_weight heparins ( `` LMWHs '' )
Claim 1 of the ¡¬618_patent recites : A heterogeneous intimate admixture of sulfated heparinic polysaccharides such sulfated polysaccharides having a weight_average_molecular_weight less than that of heparin and said admixture consisting essentially of
from 9 % to 20 % of polysaccharide_chains having a molecular_weight less than 2,000 daltons
from 5 % to 20 % of polysaccharide_chains having a molecular_weight greater than 8,000 daltons and
from 60-86 % of polysaccharide_chains having a molecular_weight of between 2 000_and_8000 daltons the ratio between the weight_average_molecular_weight and the number average molecular_weight thereof ranging from 1.BIG_TOKEN__3_to_1__BIG_TOKEN6. said admixture ( i ) exhibiting a bioavailability and antithrombotic activity greater than heparin and ( ii ) having an average molecular_weight of between approximately 3 500_and_5500 daltons
The drug is marketed as LovenoxTHE_R in the United States and ClexaneTHE_R in Europe and is effective in preventing thromboses ( blood clotting ) while minimizing the possibility of hemorrhaging especially during high-risk surgery
According to the specification the advantage of the claimed LMWHs as compared to heparin is that they exhibit a longer half-life excellent bioavailability higher rate of absorption low clearance resistance to degradation increased residence time and reduced sensitivity to serum factors
