Opinion
DAVIS Circuit_Judge
Appellant Constant has raised a large number of separate and diverse issues on appeal
The appealed decisions and rulings of the United_States_District_Court for the Central_District of California are all affirmed

DISCUSSION
In January 1985 appellant James Constant sued a large_group of high_technology_companies for infringements of his United States Patents Nos._3950,635 ( the '635_patent ) and 4,438,491 ( the '491_patent )
The complaint also contained nine counts involving other theories of recovery and included challenges to the constitutionality of 35 U.S.C.¡± 282 and of federal funding of research and development
The district_court ( Hon
Pamela A. Rymer ) dismissed all counts except the infringement claim ( Count V ) for failure to state claims upon which relief could be granted and later denied several motions by Constant attempting to revive the dismissed claims

The defendants filed counterclaims for declaratory_relief asking to have the patents declared invalid unenforceable and not infringed
The case was transferred to the Hon
Steven V. Wilson on December 16 1985
In August 1986 Judge Wilson with the agreement of all parties appointed a Special Master Robert E. Hillman to make recommendations to the court concerning motions for summary_judgment on issues of patent invalidity
After the special_master issued recommendations concluding that the patents are invalid Constant moved to disqualify the special_master and to strike his report
The court ruled against these motions after hearings during which Constant was given a special opportunity to question the master
The court independently determined that there were no material issues of contested facts and entered a summary_judgment declaring the claims of the two patents to be invalid under 35 U.S.C.¡±¡± 102 ( b ) and 103

Constant now appeals the judgments of invalidity the dismissal of his constitutional claims the appropriateness of a summary_judgment the role and conduct of the special_master and several procedural rulings of the district_court
Because of appellant 's earnest efforts to support his positions we deal with them in greater detail than their merits deserve
