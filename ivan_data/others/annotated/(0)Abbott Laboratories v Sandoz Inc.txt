Holdings : Following sua sponte order of review en banc the Court of Appeals Rader Circuit_Judge held that :

patent was limited to `` Crystal_A '' form of compound ;

process terms in product-by-process claims serve as limitations in determining patent infringement ; overruling Scripps Clinic & Research Foundation v. Genentech Inc. 927_F.2d_1565 ;

phrase `` obtainable by '' introduced limiting process steps ;

patent 's claims could not be extended under doctrine of equivalents to embrace known but unclaimed subject matter ; and

district court did not abuse its discretion in denying preliminary_injunction

Affirmed

Opinion
RADER Circuit_Judge
In this case the same patent U.S. Patent No._4935,507 ( the ¡¬507_patent ) occasions litigation in both the United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Virginia and the United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of Illinois
The Virginia District Court granted the motion of Lupin_Ltd. and Lupin_Pharmaceuticals Inc. ( collectively Lupin ) for summary_judgment of noninfringement
In the other case the Illinois District Court denied a preliminary_injunction to Abbott_Laboratories the exclusive_licensee of the ¡¬507_patent based on the claim_construction from the Eastern_District of Virginia

Because the Eastern_District of Virginia correctly construed the claims of the ¡¬507_patent and correctly discerned no genuine issues of material fact on literal_infringement of claims 2-5 or infringement by equivalents of claims 1-5 this court affirms its partial summary_judgment of noninfringement
Likewise this court affirms the Northern_District of Illinois ' denial of Abbott 's motion for a preliminary_injunction based in large part on the same correct claim_construction

I. Abbott_Laboratories the exclusive_licensee of the ¡¬507_patent markets crystalline_cefdinir according to the ¡¬507_patent under the trade name Omnicef
The Virginia case arose when Lupin sought a declaratory_judgment of noninfringement against Abbott_Laboratories and Astellas_Pharma Inc. the owner of the ¡¬507_patent ( collectively Abbott )
The Food and Drug Administration had previously approved Lupin 's Abbreviated New Drug Application ( ANDA ) to market a generic version of Omnicef
Lupin 's generic product contains almost exclusively the Crystal B form of crystalline_cefdinir ( cefdinir monohydrate ) whereas Abbott 's Omnicef product contains the Crystal_A form of crystalline_cefdinir ( cefdinir anhydrate )
Further Lupin makes its products with processes other than those claimed in the ¡¬507_patent
For these reasons Lupin brought the Virginia action to clarify that its proposed product would not infringe a valid patent
Abbott counterclaimed for infringement
The Eastern_District of Virginia construed the claims Lupin_Ltd. v. Abbott_Laboratories 484_F.Supp.2d_448 ( E.D.Va.2007 ) ( Lupin CC Order ) and ultimately granted-in-part Lupin 's motion for summary_judgment of noninfringement as to both literal and equivalent_infringement for claims 2-5 and as to equivalent_infringement for claim 1 Lupin_Ltd. v. Abbott Labs. 491_F.Supp.2d_563 ( E.D.Va.2007 ) ( Lupin SJ Order )
The parties stipulated to the dismissal without prejudice of the remaining claims ( invalidity ) and counterclaims ( literal_infringement of claim 1 )

In the Illinois action Abbott sued Sandoz Inc. and Sandoz GmbH ( collectively Sandoz ) Teva_Pharmaceuticals_USA Inc. *1286 and Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. ( collectively Teva ) Ranbaxy_Laboratories Ltd. Ranbaxy Inc. Par_Pharmaceutical_Companies Inc. and Par_Pharmaceutical ( all defendants collectively Sandoz and Teva ) for infringement of the ¡¬507_patent
Like Lupin Sandoz and Teva had previously filed ANDAs seeking to market generic versions of Omnicef
Abbott sought a preliminary_injunction in the Illinois case
For purposes of that motion the parties agreed to adopt the Eastern_District of Virginia 's claim_construction from the Lupin case
Abbott Labs
v. Sandoz Inc. 486_F.Supp.2d_767 ( N.D.Ill.2007 ) ( Sandoz PI Order )
Despite this agreement the parties to the Sandoz case disagreed as to how to interpret some of the Eastern_District of Virginia 's constructions necessitating some clarification by the Northern_District of Illinois
486 F.Supp.2d at 770-71 ( disputing `` Crystal_A '' `` peaks '' and `` about '' and seeking construction of `` powder X-ray diffraction pattern '' which the Eastern_District of Virginia had not defined )
Ultimately the Northern_District of Illinois based on the claim_construction from Virginia denied the preliminary_injunction

Both cases arrived at this court on appeal
This court heard the cases together and decides them together with this decision
