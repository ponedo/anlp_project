Synopsis
Background : Owner of patents for pioneer drug to treat gastrointestinal_disorders brought infringement action against applicants for approval to market generic versions
The United_States_District_Court for the Southern_District of New_York Barbara S. Jones J. 490_F.Supp.2d_381 declaring patents enforceable not invalid and infringed
Applicants appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Bryson Circuit_Judge held that :

post-expiration remedy existed for infringement of patent on drug due to pediatric market exclusivity period ;

patents did not require that omeprazole be stabilized without use of desiccant ;

limitation `` alkaline_reacting_compound '' was met by showing that basic compound created `` micro-pH '' in drug_core of not less than 7 ;

enhanced stability of patented pharmaceutical preparation containing omeprazole was intended result of using inert_subcoating around drug_core containing amount of alkaline_reacting_compounds ( ARC ) in drug_core sufficient to create micro-pH of not less than 7 ;

accused formulation met `` inert_subcoating '' limitation ;

owner could prove infringement by showing presence of claimed structure without identifying process by which infringing subcoating had been produced ;

formulation used had not been ready for patenting until after extensive clinical studies and real-time stability testing had been completed ; and

person of ordinary skill would not have had any reason to apply subcoating to tablets shown in example in European patent application

Opinion
BRYSON Circuit_Judge
Apotex_Corp. Apotex Inc. and Torpharm Inc. ( collectively `` Apotex '' ) and Impax_Laboratories Inc. appeal judgments entered against them by the United_States_District_Court for the Southern_District of New_York
Apotex and Impax were defendants in a multidistrict litigation initiated by plaintiffs Astrazeneca AB Aktiebolaget_Hassle KBI-E Inc. KBI Inc. and Astrazeneca_LP ( collectively `` Astra '' ) against a number of generic drug manufacturers for infringement of Astra 's patents covering formulations of omeprazole the active_ingredient in Prilosec a drug designed to treat acid-related gastrointestinal_disorders
The district_court divided the defendants into two separate `` waves '' for purposes of trial
For each wave the district_court held a consolidated bench trial

We decided appeals from the `` first wave '' litigation in In re Omeprazole Patent *1365 Litigation 84_Fed.Appx._76_(Fed.Cir.2003) and In re Omeprazole_Patent_Litigation 483_F.3d_1364_(Fed.Cir.2007)
The present appeals arise from the `` second wave '' litigation
In the second wave cases the district_court entered judgment of noninfringement with respect to Mylan Laboratories Inc. and judgments of infringement against Apotex and Impax
Astra appealed the judgment of noninfringement in the Mylan case and we recently affirmed that judgment in In re Omeprazole_Patent_Litigation 2008_WL_2369864_(Fed.Cir._June_10,_2008)
In this consolidated appeal Apotex and Impax challenge the district_court 's judgments of infringement against each of them
Because we find no error in the district_court 's decision we affirm

I
The patents involved in this appeal are U.S._Patent_No._4786,505 ( `` the ¡¬ 505 patent '' ) and U.S._Patent_No._4853,230 ( `` the ¡¬230_patent `` )
The two patents relate to pharmaceutical preparations containing omeprazole the active_ingredient in Prilosec
Omeprazole is a potent inhibitor of gastric acid secretion but it is susceptible to degradation in acid-reacting and neutral media
Its stability is also affected by moisture and organic solvents
To protect omeprazole from gastric acid in the stomach a pharmaceutical_dosage can include an enteric_coating that covers the drug_core
Enteric coatings however contain acidic compounds which can cause the omeprazole in the drug_core to decompose while the dosage is in storage resulting in discoloration and decreasing omeprazole content in the dosage over time
To increase the storage_stability of a pharmaceutical_dosage alkaline_reacting_compounds ( `` ARCs '' ) may be added to the drug_core
The addition of an ARC however can compromise the enteric_coating
A conventional enteric_coating allows for some diffusion of water from gastric juices into the drug_core but water entering the drug_core will dissolve the ARCs which can in turn cause the enteric_coating to dissolve
¡¬505_patent col. 1 line 33 to col. 2 line 4

The inventors of the ¡¬505 and ¡¬230_patent s solved that problem by adding an inert_subcoating that rapidly disintegrates in water
The subcoating increases storage_stability and provides sufficient gastric acid resistance to prevent omeprazole from degrading in the stomach
Once the dosage reaches the small intestine the solubility of the subcoating allows for rapid release of the omeprazole in the drug_core
¡¬505_patent col._5,_ll._19-68

The ¡¬505_patent covers a pharmaceutical preparation containing omeprazole
Claim 1 recites : An oral pharmaceutical preparation comprising
( a ) a core_region comprising an effective amount of a material selected from the group consisting of omeprazole plus an alkaline_reacting_compound an alkaline_omeprazole_salt plus an alkaline_reacting_compound and an alkaline_omeprazole_salt alone ; ( b ) an inert_subcoating which is soluble or rapidly disintegrating in water disposed on said core_region said subcoating comprising one or more_layers of materials selected from among tablet_excipients and polymeric film-forming compounds ; and
( c ) an outer layer disposed on said subcoating comprising an enteric_coating

The ¡¬230_patent more broadly covers a preparation containing an `` acid-labile pharmaceutically active_substance ''
Claim 1 of the ¡¬230_patent recites : A pharmaceutical preparation comprising : ( a ) an alkaline reacting core comprising an acid-labile pharmaceutically active *1366 substance and an alkaline_reacting_compound different from said active_substance an alkaline_salt of an acid_labile pharmaceutically active_substance or an alkaline_salt of an acid_labile pharmaceutically active_substance and an alkaline_reacting_compound different from said active_substance ; ( b ) an inert_subcoating which rapidly dissolves or disintegrates in water disposed on said core_region said subcoating comprising one or more_layers comprising materials selected from the group consisting of tablet_excipients film-forming compounds and alkaline compounds ; and
( c ) an enteric_coating_layer surrounding said subcoating_layer wherein the subcoating_layer isolates the alkaline reacting core from the enteric_coating_layer such that the stability of the preparation is enhanced
