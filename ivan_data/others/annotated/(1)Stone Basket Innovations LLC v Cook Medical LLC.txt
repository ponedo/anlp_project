BACKGROUND
In April 2015 Stone filed its patent infringement suit against Cook in the U.S._District_Court for the Eastern_District of Texas ( `` Eastern_District '' ) alleging infringement of the '327_patent
J.A
41-44
The '327_patent relates to a basket-type stone extraction medical device used to remove stones from biological_systems
See '327_patent Abstract col. 1_ll._9 -12
The claimed extraction basket includes a `` support filament '' such as a wire with a slideable outer sheath `` a handle comprising a sheath_movement_element '' and a `` collapsible '' wire basket used to collect the stone
Id
col. 6_ll._10 16 19 ; see id
col. 6_ll._8 -45 ( claim 1 ) ; see also id
col. 5_ll._1 -17

In May 2015 Cook filed a motion to transfer venue from the Eastern_District to the District_Court
J.A
59-71
In October 2015 Cook served its invalidity contentions
J.A
1598-625
In January 2016 Cook deposed the '327_patent 's inventor during which he was asked questions about his contact with Stone 's managing members Daniel Mitry and Timothy Salmon and the conception and filing of the '327_patent
J.A
1504-05 1510 1526-27
Specifically the '327_patent 's inventor stated regarding the addition of the `` sheath_movement_element '' in claim 1 to overcome an examiner 's rejection `` I realize there is nothing novel about it ''
J.A
1510

In March 2016 Cook petitioned the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office 's ( `` USPTO '' ) for inter partes review ( `` IPR '' ) of all claims of the '327_patent
See J.A
1628-75 ; see also Stone_Basket_II 2017_WL_2655612 at *3
Meanwhile upon granting Cook 's Motion to Transfer Venue J.A
832-34 the Eastern_District transferred the case to the District_Court
Then in April 2016 the parties filed a joint motion to stay the case pending the Patent Trial and Appeal Board ( `` PTAB '' ) 's consideration of Cook 's petition for an IPR which the District_Court granted
J.A
841-43

In September 2016 the PTAB instituted an IPR on all claims of the '327_patent
Stone_Basket_II 2017_WL_2655612 at *3
Following the PTAB 's institution one of Stone 's managing members offered to license the '327_patent to Cook in exchange for $ 150,000.00
Id
; see J.A
1714 ( confirming license offer in affidavit by Cook 's attorney )
However negotiations broke *1178 down
See J.A
1716-22 ( providing an email exchange between counsel )
In December 2016 Stone filed a motion requesting adverse judgment in the IPR proceeding J.A
1724-26 and the PTAB granted the adverse judgment motion and cancelled all of the '327_patent 's claims J.A
1729-30

That same month Stone moved to dismiss the District_Court litigation with prejudice see J.A
885 which the District_Court granted see Stone_Basket_II 2017_WL_2655612 at *3
In March 2017 Cook filed its ¡± 285 Motion J.A
1233-61 ; however the District_Court denied the ¡± 285 Motion because it determined the case was not `` exceptional '' Stone_Basket_II 2017_WL_2655612 at *1
