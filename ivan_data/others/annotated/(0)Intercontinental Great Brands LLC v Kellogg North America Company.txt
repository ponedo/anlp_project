Synopsis
Background : Patentee brought infringement action against competitor alleging infringement of resealable cookie package
Competitor asserted defenses of unenforceability and invalidity
The United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of Illinois No._1 :13-cv-00321 Matthew F. Kennelly J. 118_F.Supp.3d_1022 granted summary_judgment for competitor regarding invalidity and against competitor regarding unenforceability
Parties appealed

Holdings : The Court of Appeals Taranto Circuit_Judge held that :

skilled_artisan would have had motivation to use pull-back_resealable_package for discrete food_items with rigid_tray as disclosed in prior_art_article that was usable for variety of foods `` such as '' discrete_items like sushi and canapes to resolve known problem of insufficiently convenient_opening and reclosing arrangement for cookie_packaging to be accessed from top ;

expert testimony was not required to conclude that patent was obvious ; and

reasonable inference that patentee knew during reexamination that critical statement in prior_art_article was misprint was not sufficient to permit finding of intent required for inequitable_conduct

Affirmed

Taranto Circuit_Judge
Kraft Foods Global Brands LLC ( now called Intercontinental Great Brands ) owns U.S. Patent No._6918,532 which issued in 2005 and was supplemented with additional claims on reexamination in 2011
The '532_patent describes and claims a food package that after opening can be resealed to maintain the freshness of the food_items inside
Kraft brought this patent-infringement suit against Kellogg North America Co. Keebler Foods Co. and affiliates ( collectively Kellogg ) in the Northern_District of Illinois
The district_court held that Kellogg was entitled to summary_judgment of invalidity for obviousness of the asserted claims of the '532_patent
Intercontinental Great Brands LLC v. Kellogg N. Am Co. 118_F.Supp.3d_1022 1027-42 ( N.D. Ill. 2015 )
The court also held that Kraft was entitled to summary_judgment rejecting Kellogg 's counterclaim of unenforceability of the patent due to alleged_inequitable_conduct by Kraft chiefly in an ex parte reexamination proceeding
Id.at 1044-45
We affirm

I
The '532_patent describes a combination of two known kinds of packaging
One common for cookies uses a frame surrounded by a wrapper
The other common for wet_wipes uses a package on which the label may be pulled back to access the contents then put back in place to reseal the package to preserve the items remaining inside

Thus the background section of the patent begins : `` Containers for food_products such as cookies and other snacks typically include a frame surrounded by an outer wrapper
The frame acts as a tray to hold the food_product and to protect the food_product from damage ''
'532_patent col. 1 lines 12-15
A person wanting to consume some but not all of the items in the package `` normally '' does so `` by opening one end of the wrapper withdrawing the tray from the inside thereof and then removing the food_product from the tray ''
Id. col. 1 lines 15-18
`` [ T ] hese containers '' however `` generally do not provide a convenient_opening and reclosing arrangement
For example reclosing of the wrapper once opened generally includes simply folding or rolling the end down and clip-ping the end to keep the wrapper closed ''
Id. col. 1 lines 19-23

At the same time `` [ r ] eclosable seals have been used for dispensing bags for wet tissue or disposable cleaning wipes ''
Id. col. 1 lines 24-25
`` The label on these bags can be pulled back thereby exposing an opening allowing access to the wet_tissues or wipes inside ''
Id. col. 1 lines 25-27
`` Typically '' however `` these dispensing bags '' lack a rigid internal structure i.e. `` are completely flexible formed exclusively of a plastic or other suitable flexible material which closely surrounds the pack of wet_tissues or wipes ''
Id. col. 1 lines 27-30
Lacking an internal rigid structure `` such known dispensing bags are not well suited for containing food_products as *1340 these containers fail to provide adequate_protection for storing food_products ''
Id. col. 1 lines 34-36

The patent then introduces the invention : The purpose of the present invention is to provide a new and improved container for food_products such as rigid food articles for example cookies and the like which container provides adequate_protection for the contents thereof while concurrently facilitating opening of the container wrapper and resealing the seal to protect the contents thereof until the contents are fully consumed
Id. col. 1 lines 39-46

Claim 1 which is largely representative for purposes of this appeal recites as follows : 1
A polygonal shaped food container comprising : a frame defining the polygonal shape of the container said container having a top a bottom [ ] and sides connecting the top and bottom the frame containing a food_product comprised of discrete_food_articles ; a wrapper surrounding said frame said wrapper forming the top [ ] sides [ ] and bottom of the container ; said top having an access_opening sufficiently large to provide hand_access to substantially all of the discrete_food_articles contained within the frame such that substantially any one of the discrete_food_articles can be accessed and removed individually through said access_opening ; and
a sealing layer adhesively sealed to said top around said opening said sealing layer including a starter_portion located near a side of the top which can be grasped by a user said sealing layer being releasable when said starter_portion is pulled in a direction away from said side to in turn pull and thereby release at least a portion of said sealing layer to provide the hand_access to said top access_opening and reclosable against said top to seal said opening when said sealing layer is moved back against the said top
Id. col. 5 lines 29-51

In October 2007 about two years after the '532_patent issued a Swedish company that produces resealable packages sought an ex parte reexamination of that patent from the U.S. Patent and Trademark_Office
Intercontinental 118 F.Supp.3d at 1026
The Office initiated the reexamination and in April 2010 the examiner ( in the central reexamination unit ) rejected all claims except two of the claims that Kraft added ( to which the examiner objected ) relying centrally on a short 2001 article in Packaging_News that displayed and described Re-Seal It packaging made by a Swedish firm and marketed by Paramount_Packaging
In August 2011 however the Patent Trial and Appeal Board reversed all of the rejections
It relied critically on a particular phrase in the Packaging_News_article asserting the conventionality of the wrapping_film to distinguish the Kraft patent claims-a phrase that does not appear in the descriptions of Paramount Re-Seal It packaging in the distinct prior-art articles that became central in the present litigation
Ex Parte Kraft Foods Global Brands LLC. No._2011-005770 2011_WL_3754634_(P.T.A.B._Aug._19,_2011)
The resulting reexamination certificate contained the original claims 1-25 and new claims 26-67

In 2013 Kraft sued Kellogg for infringement of a number of claims of the '532_patent
In particular Kraft alleged that Kellogg infringed by making using selling and offering certain resealable cookie_packages that a Kellogg document suggested were designed to `` 'circumvent [ ] the Kraft patent while maintaining similar properties '
`` Intercontinental 118 F.Supp.3d at 1026 ( alteration in original )
*1341 Kellogg responded by alleging among other things that the asserted claims of the '532_patent were invalid for obviousness and that the patent was unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct by Kraft before the Board in securing reversal of the examiner 's rejections during reexamination
Kellogg eventually moved for summary_judgment of invalidity and Kraft moved for summary_judgment on Kellogg 's counterclaim of unenforceability due to inequitable_conduct.1

The district_court granted Kellogg 's motion for summary_judgment of invalidity of all of the asserted claims ( 1 3 4 6 26 32 33 34 35 36 37 39 and 42 ) under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103 ( 2006 )2 As the patent itself makes clear the `` frame '' element is shown by prior_art such as U.S. Patent No._3740,238 issued to Graham which discloses a traditional cookie package with a frame to hold the cookies described as prior_art in the '532_patent
And while the patent makes clear that non-food prior_art showed a peel-back_resealable_package without a rigid structure ( packaging for wet_wipes ) what the patent does not show but the record in this litigation reveals is prior_art showing a peel-back_resealable_package with a rigid_tray for food_items ( `` such as '' discrete_items like sushi and canapes ) -namely two related articles in the Machinery_Update publication describing and showing a Re-Seal It package marketed in Britain by Paramount_Packaging as an agent for Real-Seal It Sweden
See Machinery_Update March/April 2002_at_59 -60 ( J.A
4423-24 ) ; Machinery_Update September/October 2001_at_46 -47 ( J.A
4708-09 )

First considering independent claims 1_and_34 the district_court concluded that the record put beyond reasonable dispute that all claim elements except the `` frame '' element were shown in the Machinery_Update_articles and the `` frame '' element was shown in the prior_art of cookie_packaging such as the Graham patent
Intercontinental 118 F.Supp.3d at 1030-34
The court then determined that the only reasonable inference on the record was that a relevant skilled_artisan would have been motivated to combine those prior-art references
The court specifically stressed that the absence of a `` convenient_opening and reclosing arrangement '' was a `` known problem '' for cookie_packaging and that the Machinery_Update resealable tray-included packaging for foods offered a skilled_artisan a solution to the problem simply by replacing the Machinery_Update `` tray '' with a frame i.e. a tray with higher sides
More generally the court considered the simple and clear teachings of the art the importance of common sense and ordinary creativity and the conclusory character of Kraft 's expert 's assertions of nonobviousness
Id.at 1034-38
The court next analyzed the various dependent claims finding no basis for a different conclusion about the art-based portion of the obviousness analysis
Id.at 1038-41

Finally the court concluded that Kraft 's evidence of certain objective indicia though substantial was simply not entitled to such weight in the ultimate legal assessment *1342 of obviousness as to produce a bottom-line conclusion of anything but invalidity
Id.at 1041-42
In particular the court determined that Kraft had strong evidence of commercial success tied to the patent-claimed packaging industry praise and copying by Kellogg
Id.at 1041
Nevertheless the court concluded `` this is a case in which the secondary_considerations do not overcome Kellogg 's extremely strong prima facie showing that the invention was obvious in light of Machinery_Update ''
Id
The court explained : In this case the prior_art references teach all of the claim limitations-all of the elements could be found in existing food packaging technology
In fact nearly all of the elements were found in one Machinery_Update_article and the rest already existed in cookie_packages
Additionally the technology is relatively simple
Based on these considerations a person skilled in the art would have a reason to combine the elements to create the invention
In sum the primary considerations lead to a conclusion that the invention was obvious in light of the prior_art and [ Intercontinental 's ] strong showing of secondary_considerations does not outweigh this determination
In sum based on the undisputed facts all of the asserted claims are invalid as obvious in light of Machinery_Update when combined with existing cookie_packages
Id.at 1042

With regard to Kellogg 's unenforceability challenge to the '532_patent based chiefly on alleged_inequitable_conduct by Kraft in the reexamination proceeding the court granted Kraft 's motion for summary_judgment rejecting the challenge
Id.at 1044-45
The court explained that the charge of inequitable_conduct during reexamination did not and could not rest on withholding by Kraft of material prior_art ; in particular `` [ i ] t is undisputed that [ the 2002 ] Machinery_Update [ article ].. [ was ] presented during reexamination ''
Id.at 1044
The court then addressed Kellogg 's key charge-that Kraft 's counsel did not tell the Patent and Trademark_Office ( PTO ) that the phrase in the Packaging_News_article about the conventionality of the wrapping_film on which the Board came to rely in upholding Kraft 's claims was actually a misprint as allegedly made evident by the opposite characterization of the film used in Re-Seal It packaging in the 2002 Machinery_Update_article
The district_court while agreeing that the phrase in Packaging_News likely was a misprint concluded that Kraft 's counsel `` merely restated the contents of the misprinted article '' and `` [ t ] here is no evidence that the attorney knowingly failed to identify the inconsistency between the two articles ''
Intercontinental 118 F.Supp.3d at 1045
Kellogg thus had not presented evidence that could meet the standard for intent to deceive established in Therasense Inc. v. Becton Dickinson & Co. 649_F.3d_1276 1290-91 ( Fed
Cir
2011 ) ( en banc )
