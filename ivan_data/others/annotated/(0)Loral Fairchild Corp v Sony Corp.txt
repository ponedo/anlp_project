* Synopsis
Patent assignee brought infringement action against electronics manufacturer
After jury returned verdict in favor of assignee on issues of ownership validity and infringement under the doctrine of equivalents the United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of New_York 931_F.Supp._1014 granted manufacturer 's motion for judgment as matter of law ( JMOL ) holding that manufacturer did not infringe patents
Assignee appealed
The Court of Appeals Archer Senior_Circuit_Judge held that : ( 1 ) process patent was not infringed literally or under doctrine of equivalents ; ( 2 ) patent for structure of charge coupled device ( CCD ) was not infringed under doctrine of equivalents ; and ( 3 ) assignee was barred by prosecution history estoppel from asserting that accused devices infringed structure patent

Opinion
ARCHER Senior_Circuit_Judge
Loral Fairchild Corporation ( Loral ) appeals the July_23,_1996 judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of New_York No._91- CV-5056 holding that Sony Corporation and Sony Electronics Inc. ( Sony ) did not infringe Loral 's patents
As pertinent here the court held on summary_judgment that Sony did not literally infringe United_States_Patent_No._3931,674 ( the '674_patent ) and contrary to the jury 's verdict that it also did not infringe the patent under the doctrine of equivalents
The court also held again contrary to the jury 's verdict that Sony did not infringe *1316 United_States_Patent_No._3896,485 ( the '485_patent ) under the doctrine of equivalents.1 We affirm

BACKGROUND
I
Procedural Background
Loral assignee of the '674 and '485_patent s brought an infringement suit against a number of Japanese electronics manufacturers including those who manufacture and sell semiconductors and consumer electronic devices and those who purchase semiconductors and manufacture consumer electronic devices.2 The district_court resolved a number of issues as a matter of law clarifying and limiting the issues that needed to go to trial
See Loral_Fairchild_Corp. v. Victor_Co. of Japan Ltd. 906_F.Supp._813_(E.D.N.Y.1995) ( granting defendants ' motion for summary_judgment on marking )
In connection with its preliminary holdings the district_court held a two day `` Markman hearing '' to resolve the claim construction issues
See Loral_Fairchild_Corp. v. Victor_Co. of Japan Ltd. 906_F.Supp._798_(E.D.N.Y.1995) ( construing disputed claims of the patents )

Following the construction of the claims Sony moved for summary_judgment that it neither literally infringed nor infringed under the doctrine of equivalents either of the patents at issue
The court granted Sony 's motion of no literal infringement as to both patents but denied the motion as to infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
See Order Granting in Part_Sony 's Motion for Summary_Judgment of Non-Infringement of the '674_Patent ( Civil_Action_Nos._92-0128-_ARR 91-5056-ARR December 14 1995 ) ; Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part_Sony 's Motion for Summary_Judgment of Non-Infringement of the '485_Patent and Denying Toshiba 's Motion for Summary_Judgment on Invalidity of the '485_Patent ( Civil_Action_Nos._92-0128-_ARR 91-5056-ARR December 15 1995 )

Concerned about potential prejudice to the defendants in this case the court also separated the trial of each of the manufacturing defendants
Sony 's trial proceeded first

The trial was held in January 1996 on the issues of ownership infringement under the doctrine of equivalents and validity
After five weeks of trial the jury was given a detailed set of written instructions with integrated special verdicts for separate factual issues
After four days of deliberation the jury found that Loral owned both patents that Sony infringed both patents under the doctrine of equivalents and had induced infringement of the '674_patent and that Sony failed to prove that any of the claims at issue were invalid

Following the verdict the court considered Sony 's motion for judgment as a matter of law and in the alternative for a new trial
The court granted Sony 's motion holding inter alia that infringement of the '674_patent was precluded by prosecution history estoppel3 and that infringement of the '485_patent could not stand under a proper claim interpretation

The case was certified for appeal to this court under Fed.R.Civ.P

The Technology
The patents at issue describe inventions in semiconductor technology known as charge coupled devices ( CCD )
This technology has proven useful in devices where there is a need to store a continuously changing image such as camcorders cameras copiers and facsimile machines

The imager of a camcorder for example localizes on its surface electrical_charges created from light to which it has been exposed into an array of many small points or pixels each of which can contain a packet of electrical_charge thus defining a picture corresponding to the view that the user intends to record
The CCD which collects the charges associated with the changing image is part of a semiconductor structure further housing a thin layer of nonconductive insulation and a series of gate electrodes on the top surface of the material
When voltage is applied to one of these gate electrodes it creates a `` potential_well '' in the semiconductor_substrate beneath the electrode
A packet of electrical_charge representing a pixel can be stored in the potential_well and by alternately applying two different voltages to adjacent gate electrodes the charge_packets can be forced to move through the semiconductor_substrate in one direction
By transporting the charge_packets the image is stored and removed to allow the next image to be stored
Backward movement of the charge_packets is prevented by ion implanted barriers
