Synopsis
Action was brought for defendant 's alleged infringement of patents related to apparatus and methods of chemical_vapor_deposition
The United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of California Robert P. Aguilar J. granted defendant 's motions for summary_judgment based on alleged invalidity of patents and appeal was taken
The Court of Appeals Baldwin Senior_Circuit_Judge held that : ( 1 ) presumption of validity attaching to patent which was finally issued after applicant introduced new_evidence to rebut prior finding of prima_facie obviousness carried with it the assumption that new_evidence was material and ( 2 ) patent that was issued for radiation-heated reactor used in chemical_vapor_deposition did not anticipate later patent issued for chemical_vapor_deposition process and thereby render it invalid

Vacated and remanded

Opinion
BALDWIN Senior_Circuit_Judge
This is an appeal by plaintiff Applied Materials Inc. ( Applied ) from the final *280 judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of California granting the motions for summary_judgment of defendant Gemini Research Corporation ( Gemini )
Applied sued Gemini for infringement of four patents related to apparatus and methods of chemical_vapor_deposition ( CVD )
Gemini filed four motions for summary_judgment challenging the validity of Applied 's patents
The district_court granted two of these motions invalidating all four patents and entered a final judgment in favor of Gemini
We vacate and remand

Background
Applied contends that Gemini has infringed U.S. patent Nos._3623,712 ( '712_patent ) 4,047,496 ( '496_patent ) 4,081,313 ( '313_patent ) and 4,496,609 ( '609_patent )
The four patents in suit all grew out of a single application filed by McNeilly and Benzing on October 15 1969
The United_States_Patent and Trademark Office ( PTO ) required the application be restricted a requirement that resulted in three applications each claiming a patentably distinct invention : a radiation heated reactor ( issued as the '712_patent ) a CVD_gas_reactant_reactor ( issued as the '496_patent ) and a CVD coating process including both method and apparatus_claims ( issued as the '609 and '313_patent s )
Applied elected to prosecute the radiantly heated CVD reactor claims which appear in the '712_patent issued in November 1971

A divisional_application was filed for the CVD_gas_reactant_reactor
After two continuation_applications and the execution of a terminal disclaimer the application for the CVD_gas_reactant_reactor issued in September 1977 as the '496_patent

A second divisional_application was filed for the coating process followed by a continuation-in-part application which inter alia included the addition of Locke as an inventor
The examiner issued a second restriction requirement resulting in separate applications for the coating method claims for which Locke was a joint inventor and the coating apparatus_claims
Applied elected to prosecute the coating apparatus_claims

A divisional_application was filed for the coating method claims with McNeilly Benzing and Locke as the inventors
After another continuation_application and another restriction requirement the '313_patent issued in March 1978

A continuation_application was filed for the coating apparatus_claims
Locke was deleted as an inventor
The examiner rejected these claims as prima_facie obvious
The United_States_Patent and Trademark Office Board of Patent_Appeals and Interferences and the United_States_Court of Customs and Patent_Appeals ( CCPA ) In re McNeilly 612_F.2d_585_(C.C.P.A.1979) affirmed the rejections
Finally after two more continuation_applications and the introduction of new_evidence to rebut the finding of prima_facie obviousness the '609_patent issued in January 1985

Gemini requested summary_judgment on the invalidity of the four patents in suit in four motions on the following grounds respectively : ( 1 ) the '609 '712 and '496_patent s are invalid on the theory of collateral estoppel and res judicata* in view of In re McNeilly ; ( 2 ) the '313_patent is invalid because of anticipation under 35 U.S.C.¡± 102 ( e ) ; ( 3 ) inequitable conduct on the part of Applied in prosecuting the applications of these patents ; and ( 4 ) double patenting
The district_court granted the first two motions the third was not decided and the fourth was withdrawn
Only the two motions that were granted are at issue in this appeal
