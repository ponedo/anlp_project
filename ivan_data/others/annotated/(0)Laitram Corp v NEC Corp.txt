163_F.3d_1342
United States Court of Appeals Federal Circuit
THE LAITRAM CORPORATION Plaintiff-Appellee v. NEC CORPORATION and NEC_Information_Systems Inc. Defendants-Appellants
No._98-1060
| Dec._18,_1998
Synopsis
Patentee for electro-optical printer that printed alphanumeric_characters on photosensitive recording medium brought infringement action against competitor
After jury returned verdict of infringement the United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Louisiana Edith Brown Clement J. 1994_WL_261966 granted judgment as matter of law ( JMOL ) for competitor as to claim of noninfringement
The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded 62_F.3d_1388
On remand the District_Court entered judgment of damages for patent infringement and denied competitor 's motion for relief from judgment 1995_WL_758904
The Court of Appeals 115_F.3d_947 again reversed and remanded for consideration of previously unaddressed issue of claim_identicality
On remand the District_Court 1997_WL_539890 denied competitor 's motion for JMOL that reexamined claims and original_claims were not identical
Competitor appealed
The Court of Appeals Lourie Circuit_Judge held that scope of claims in reexamined patent was not identical to scope of original_claims due to addition of limitation that characters be of `` type_quality ''

Reversed

Opinion
LOURIE Circuit_Judge
NEC Corporation and NEC_Information_Systems Inc. ( collectively `` NEC '' ) appeal from the decision of the United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Louisiana denying its motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law ( JMOL ) that reexamined claims 1_and_2 of Laitram 's U.S. Patent 3,952,311 are not identical in scope to original_claims 1_and_2
See Laitram Corp. v. NEC Corp. Civ
A. No._89-1571- N 1997_WL_539890 ( E.D.La
Sept. 2 1997 )
Because we conclude that the scope of the claims was substantively changed by amendment during reexamination we reverse

BACKGROUND
A
The Invention
Laitram is the assignee of the '311_patent which `` relates to high_speed electro-optical printing systems and particularly to systems employing radiation-sensitive image-recording mediums to produce records of information as type characters and/or in graphic form ''
See '311_patent col._1,_ll._5-9
Independent claim 1 is directed to such a printing apparatus and independent claim 2 is directed to a method for printing in this fashion
The parties dispute whether the scope of the original_claims was substantively changed following several amendments made during the reexamination of the '311_patent
These amendments are emphasized in reexamined claims 1_and_2 with deletions in brackets : 1
An electro-optical printing apparatus for printing type_quality_alpha-numeric_characters at high_speed on a surface of photosensitive recording_material said apparatus comprising : a plurality of rapidly reacting radiation_emitters each being capable of emitting radiation at wavelengths to which said surface is sensitive said emitters being disposed in an array along a substantially straight_line said array being a plurality of rows of said radiation_emitters ; means for moving said recording_material in a single direction substantially perpendicular to said straight_line with its surface adjacent to said array and at a substantially constant_speed relative to said array and ; means for selectively activating each of said emitters for predetermined_periods of time and
means for coordinating the predetermined period of time in which each of the said plurality of emitters are activated with said constant relative speed of said recording_material so that the radiation emitted by said emitters will be recorded on selected areas of said recording surface in the form of an alipha [ sic ] -numeric image each of said emitters being positioned to irradiate a different_area of said recording surface the different_areas of said surface irradiated by each of the said emitters being arranged in an overlapping relationship with one another and said plurality of emitters being of sufficient number to print said type_quality_alpha-numeric_characters
2
A method of electro-optically printing type_quality_alpha-numeric_characters at high_speed on the recording surface of a photosensitive_material said method comprising the steps of : arranging a plurality of rapidly reacting radiation_emitters in a straight_line *1345 array each of the said emitters being capable of emitting radiation at wavelengths to which said photosensitive_material is sensitive selectively energizing for predetermined_periods of time each of the said emitters transmitting the emitted radiation from each of the said emitters to a different_area on said surface providing relative_movement along a single coordinate substantially perpendicular to said array at substantially constant_speed between said recording surface and said emitters and
coordinating the predetermined_periods of time in which each of said plurality of emitters [ are ] is selectively energized with said constant_speed of said relative_movement between said emitters and recording surface so that alpha-numeric_character_images are recorded on said recording surface by exposure of selected [ ares ] area of said recording surface by said emitted radiation said step of coordinating including the steps of synchronously generating a first data signal which programs the order [ to ] of energization of said emitters and a second data signal which determines the duration of the energization period of said emitters and employing said first and second data signals to effect energization of said emitters so as to record said alpha-numeric_character_images of said type_quality at said high_speed
See '311_patent reexamination certificate col._1,_ll._22-67 col._2,_ll._1-19 ( emphasis and bracketing in original paragraphing added )
The added limitations generally address three aspects of the disclosed invention : speed type_quality and direction of movement
Because our conclusion regarding claim_identicality may be based on the type_quality amendment alone we limit our analysis to that limitation
