Opinion
LOURIE Circuit_Judge Telsmith Inc. appeals from a decision of the United_States_District_Court for the Eastern_District of Wisconsin holding that Nordberg Inc. did not engage in inequitable_conduct during the prosecution of U.S. Patent 4,478,373 and finding that the case was not `` exceptional '' under 35 U.S.C.¡± 285
Nordberg Inc. v. Telsmith Inc. 881_F.Supp._1252 36_USPQ2d_1577_(E.D.Wis.1995)
Because Telsmith has not demonstrated error in the court 's decision we affirm

BACKGROUND
Nordberg owner of the '373_patent directed to a gyratory_rock_crusher sued Telsmith for infringement
Telsmith counterclaimed for a declaration that the asserted claims were invalid unenforceable and not infringed
After a bench trial the district court found that the asserted claims were invalid for obviousness over the prior art which included Nordberg 's own Saunders U.S. Patent 3,125,304
The court also held that the claims were invalid based on Nordberg 's public use of the claimed invention at a quarry owned and operated by the Tanner Company in Phoenix Arizona more than one year before the filing date of the patent application
Nordberg has not appealed these determinations

Although holding the patent invalid the court rejected Telsmith 's claim that the patent was unenforceable because of Nordberg 's conduct
The court found that the Saunders_patent and Tanner_use constituted material_prior_art that was not disclosed to the United States Patent and Trademark_Office ( `` PTO '' ) during prosecution of the '373_patent
The court also found however that the Nordberg employees who were under a duty of disclosure including those who prosecuted the '373_patent were unaware of the existence of the Saunders_patent during prosecution
Thus the court found that Nordberg did not conceal the Saunders_patent
The court further found that the relevant Nordberg employees did not conceal the Tanner_use from the PTO with the intent to mislead because they believed in good faith that the field testing at Tanner occurred under a confidentiality agreement and thus was not material_prior_art
Because the court found no intention by Nordberg to mislead the PTO it held that Nordberg did not engage in inequitable_conduct
