Before CLEVENGER BRYSON and PROST Circuit_Judges
Opinion
PROST Circuit_Judge
Brassica_Protection_Products_LLC and Johns_Hopkins_University ( collectively `` Brassica '' ) appeal from the decision of the United_States_District_Court for the District of Maryland granting summary_judgment that U.S. Patent Nos._5725,895 ( `` the ¡¬895_patent `` ) 5,968,567 ( `` the ¡¬567_patent `` ) and 5,968,505 ( `` the ¡¬505_patent `` ) are invalid as anticipated by the prior_art
In re_Cruciferous_Sprout_Patent_Litig. 168_F.Supp.2d_534 60_USPQ2d_1758_(D.Md.2001)
We affirm the district_court 's ruling

BACKGROUND
The three patents-in-suit relate to growing and eating sprouts to reduce the level of carcinogens in animals thereby reducing the risk of developing cancer
Specifically the patents describe methods of preparing food_products that contain high_levels of substances that induce Phase 2 enzymes
These enzymes are part of the human body 's mechanism for detoxifying potential carcinogens
Thus they have a chemoprotective effect against cancer
¡¬ 895 patent col._1,_ll._28-34
Foods that are rich in glucosinolates such as certain cruciferous sprouts have high Phase 2 enzyme-inducing potential
The inventors of the patents-in-suit recognized that the Phase 2 enzyme-inducing agents ( or their glucosinolate precursors ) are far more concentrated in certain sprouts ( such as broccoli and cauliflower but not cabbage cress mustard or radish ) that are harvested before the two-leaf_stage than in corresponding adult plants
Id.at col._7,_l._63 col._8,_l._14
However glucosinolate levels in cruciferous_plants can be highly variable
See id.at col._12,_ll._66-67 ( `` There is variation in inducer potential among different broccoli cultivars `` )
According to the inventors it is therefore desirable to select the seeds of those cruciferous_plants which when germinated and harvested before the two-leaf_stage produce sprouts that contain high_levels of the desired enzyme-inducing potential

The ¡¬895_patent was filed on September 15 1995 and claims inter alia `` A method of preparing a food_product rich in glucosinolates comprising germinated cruciferous_seeds with the exception of cabbage cress mustard and radish seeds and harvesting sprouts prior to the 2-leaf_stage to form a food_product comprising a plurality of sprouts ''
¡¬895_patent claim 1
The ¡¬ 567 patent is a continuation of the ¡¬895_application and it claims a `` method of preparing a human food_product '' from sprouts
¡¬567_patent claims 1_and_9
The ¡¬505_patent is a divisional of the ¡¬895_application and it claims a `` method of increasing the chemoprotective amount of Phase 2 enzymes in a mammal '' as well as a `` method of reducing the level of carcinogens in a mammal '' by creating a `` food_product '' from sprouts and then `` administering said food_product '' to a mammal
¡¬505_patent claims 1_and_16

The three patents-in-suit are owned by Johns_Hopkins_University and exclusively licensed to Brassica_Protection_Products_LLC
Johns Hopkins and Brassica sued Sunrise_Farms Becky_Crikelair Frank_Crikelair Edrich Farms Inc.

Lawrence_Ravitz Harmony *1346 Farms International_Specialty_Supply Greg_Lynn Lorna_Lynn and Robert_L._Rust ( collectively `` defendants '' ) in various district_courts
Pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1407 the Judicial_Panel on Multidistrict_Litigation consolidated the various cases in the District of Maryland for pretrial proceedings
On June_7,_2001 the defendants filed a joint motion for partial summary_judgment of invalidity arguing that the patents were anticipated by prior_art references disclosing growing and eating sprouts
Brassica filed a cross-motion for summary_judgment that the patents are not invalid
On July_23,_2001 the district_court held a Markman hearing to address claim construction issues and the parties ' motions for summary_judgment

On August 10 2001 the court granted defendants ' motion for summary_judgment of invalidity and denied Brassica 's cross-motion for summary_judgment
According to the district_court `` [ t ] he record before the Court makes it abundantly clear that prior to the issuance of the patents-in-suit one skilled in the art could by following the teachings of the prior_art germinate broccoli seeds harvest the sprouts and sell them as a food_product ''
In re_Cruciferous_Sprout_Patent_Litig. 168 F.Supp.2d at 540 60 USPQ2d at 1762
While recognizing that the inventors of the patents-in-suit may have discovered a new and significant property of certain_types of cruciferous sprouts the district_court concluded that `` merely describing unexpected beneficial results of a known process does not entitle Plaintiffs to patent that process ''
Id.at 538 60 USPQ2d at 1760
Thus a `` plant ( broccoli sprouts ) long well known in nature and cultivated and eaten by humans for decades [ can not ] be patented merely on the basis of a recent realization that the plant has always had some heretofore unknown but naturally occurring beneficial feature ''
Id.at 537 60 USPQ2d at 1759
On October 1 2001 the court entered a Judgment Under Rule 54 ( b ) in favor of defendants but limited its invalidity ruling to claims 1-BIG_TOKEN__6_and_9__BIG_TOKEN of the ¡¬895_patent claims 1-8 of the ¡¬567_patent and claims 1_and_16 of the ¡¬505_patent
In re_Cruciferous_Sprout_Patent_Litig. MDL Docket No._1388 ( D.Md
Oct._1,_2001 ) ( Rule 54 ( b ) Determination )
Brassica appeals the judgment of invalidity arguing that the district_court failed to properly construe the claims and did not apply the properly construed claims to the prior_art when determining that the claims are anticipated under 35 U.S.C.¡± 102 ( b )
We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
