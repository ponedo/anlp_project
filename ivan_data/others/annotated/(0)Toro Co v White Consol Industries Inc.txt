The United States District Court for the District of Minnesota David S. Doty J. granted summary judgment finding infringement and competitor appealed
The Court of Appeals Pauline Newman Circuit_Judge held that : ( 1 ) phrase `` attachment means for removably securing said inlet air cover to said housing '' did not require that cover be entirely separated from housing and ( 2 ) phrase `` cover including means for increasing the pressure '' required device 's restriction_ring to be permanently affixed to and included as part of the cover

Reversed and remanded

BACKGROUND
The '528_patent describes and claims a hand-held convertible_vacuum/blower an implement for yard work that can be used both as a vacuum cleaner for collecting leaves and other_debris and as a blower for dispersing the same
In both modes a centrifugal fan ( called an impeller ) rotating in a housing moves air through the device in a constant direction sucking air in through an air_inlet and blowing air out through an air_outlet or exhaust
For use in vacuum cleaner mode the operator connects a vacuum tube and nozzle to the air_inlet and places a collection_bag over the air_outlet
Debris is sucked into the impeller where it is mulched by action of the fan and then blown through the air_outlet into the collection_bag
For use as a blower the operator connects a directing tube to the air_outlet and places a protective cover over the air_inlet_opening to keep hands clothing and debris clear of the fan
Such devices were known to the prior art

The '528_patent is directed to a vacuum/blower wherein the air velocity is adjusted depending on whether the device is used as a vacuum cleaner or as a blower
The velocity of the air during use as a blower is increased by reducing the size of the air_inlet.2 In vacuum mode however such reduction of the air_inlet_opening is not desired for twigs and other_debris can more easily clog the inlet thus impeding operation of the device

In the device as claimed in the '528_patent the cover is fitted with a ring that restricts the size of the air_inlet in blower mode and prevents air spill between the high pressure side and the low pressure side of the impeller blades
As illustrated in patent Figure 4 this restriction_ring ( 76 ) is attached to the air_inlet cover which itself has apertures through which air passes
