BACKGROUND
In 1982 Kearns filed an action against Chrysler alleging infringement of U.S
Patents 3,351,836 3,564,374 3,602,790 and 3,581,178 all relating to electronic intermittent windshield wipers ( IWWs ) for use in automotive vehicles
At the time the suit was filed Kearns had three similar suits pending against other automobile manufacturers and distributors involving the same patents Kearns v. Ford Motor Co. Civil_Action_No._78-70740 ( E.D.Mich
) ; Kearns v. Wood_Motors Inc. Civil_Action_No._78-70642 ( E.D.Mich
) ; SWF-Spezialfabrik fur Autozubehor Gustav Rav GmbH v. Kearns Civil Action No._79-74451 ( E.D.Mich
)1

On October 22 1982 proceedings in the Chrysler action were stayed pending resolution of the earlier filed suits
The stay was instituted pursuant to Chrysler 's stipulation that it would be `` bound by the judgment as to the validity of.. U.S. patent Nos._3351,836 3,564,374 3,581,178 and 3,602,790 '' in either Ford Wood_Motors or SWF whichever was the last to be adjudicated
The stipulation expressly provided however that Chrysler would `` not be bound by any consent_judgment ''

In 1989 shortly before the Ford_case went to trial Chrysler renewed its stipulation regarding the issues of invalidity and unenforceability
Subject to continuation of the court-ordered stay Chrysler agreed to be `` bound by the judgment ( excluding a consent_judgment ) in the Kearns v. Ford_case C.A
78-70740 as to the validity and enforceability of the patents involved in that action that are also involved in this action
Those patents included United States Patent Nos._3351,836 3,564,374 3,581,178 and 3,602,790 ''
That stipulation was subsequently entered by the court on February 15 1990
