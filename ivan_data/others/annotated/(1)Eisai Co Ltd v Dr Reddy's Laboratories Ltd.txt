Before RADER LINN and PROST Circuit_Judges
Opinion
RADER Circuit_Judge
On summary_judgment the United_States_District_Court for the Southern_District of New_York found in favor of plaintiffs Eisai_Co. Ltd. and Eisai Inc. ( collectively Eisai ) with respect to the validity and enforceability of U.S. Patent No._5045,552 ( '552_patent )
Eisai_Co. v. Teva Pharms
USA Inc. 472_F.Supp.2d_493 ( S.D.N.Y.2006 ) ( SJ Validity Order ) ; Eisai_Co. v. Dr._Reddy 's Labs. Ltd. No._03_Civ
9053 ( S.D.N.Y
Oct._5,_2006 ) ( SJ Enforceability Order )
After a bench trial the district_court found that Dr._Reddy 's Laboratories Ltd. and Dr._Reddy 's Laboratories Inc. ( collectively Dr._Reddy 's ) and Teva_Pharmaceuticals_USA Inc. ( Teva ) had failed to prove the remaining allegations of inequitable_conduct and that Eisai had established that Dr._Reddy 's and Teva infringed Eisai 's ¡¬552_patent
Eisai_Co. v. Dr._Reddy 's Labs. Ltd. No._03_Civ
9053 2007_WL_1406565_(S.D.N.Y._May_11,_2007) ( Trial_Order )
Because the district_court correctly determined that the ¡¬552_patent is non-obvious over the proffered prior art and that Eisai 's alleged acts during prosecution did not rise to the level of inequitable_conduct this court affirms

*1356 I
The ¡¬552_patent claims rabeprazole and its salts
Rabeprazole is part of a class of drugs known as proton pump inhibitors which suppress gastric acid production by inhibiting action of the enzyme H +K+ATPase
The distinctions between rabeprazole and its salts are not relevant for this appeal
Therefore this court refers to rabeprazole and its salts collectively as `` rabeprazole ''
Rabeprazole 's sodium salt is the active ingredient in Aciphex a pharmaceutical approved in 1991 by the FDA for the treatment of duodenal_ulcers heartburn and associated disorders
Aciphex has been a commercial success garnering over $ 1 billion in worldwide yearly sales

Dr._Reddy 's and Teva each filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications ( ANDAs ) under the Hatch-Waxman Act 21 U.S.C.¡± 355_and_35 U.S.C.¡± 271 ( e ) seeking to manufacture a generic version of Aciphex before the expiration of the ¡¬552_patent
Because filing an ANDA is an artificial but legally cognizable act of patent infringement see Glaxo Group Ltd. v. Apotex Inc. 376_F.3d_1339 1344 ( 2004 ) Eisai filed suit against Dr._Reddy 's and Teva
Eisai also sued Mylan Laboratories Inc. and Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. ( collectively Mylan ) another ANDA filer but that proceeding was stayed pending the outcome of these actions
Mylan agreed to be bound by the final judgments and any appeals in these cases
Eisai_Co. Ltd. v. Mylan Labs. Inc. No._04 Civ
656 ( S.D.N.Y
Nov._3,_2004 )
Both Dr._Reddy 's and Teva conceded infringement of claims 1-6 of the ¡¬552_patent but asserted that the ¡¬552_patent is unenforceable for inequitable_conduct
Trial_Order at 6-7
Dr._Reddy 's stipulated to the validity of all six of the ¡¬552_patent 's claims id.at 6 but Teva argued before the district_court and maintains on appeal that the ¡¬552_patent is invalid for obviousness
Both Dr._Reddy 's and Teva appeal the trial_court 's judgments of enforceability
Neither Dr._Reddy 's nor Teva appeals the trial_court 's judgment of infringement
This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 )
