Synopsis
Petroleum refiners brought action against patentee seeking a declaratory_judgment to invalidate patent claiming automotive_gasoline_compositions designed to reduce automobile_tailpipe_emissions
Patentee counterclaimed alleging willful_infringement
After declaratory_judgment_action was effectively converted into infringement_defense jury found for patentee on issues of validity and the United_States_District_Court for the Central_District of California denied refiners ' motion for judgment as a matter of law ( JMOL )
The District Court 34_F.Supp.2d_1208 34_F.Supp.2d_1222 determined that patent was not unenforceable for inequitable_conduct and awarded attorney_fees
Refiners appealed
The Court of Appeals Rader Circuit_Judge held that : ( 1 ) patent_claims were directed to compositions of matter and were not limited to only certain uses of those compositions ; ( 2 ) patent_claims were not anticipated by prior art ; and ( 3 ) written description was adequate

RADER Circuit_Judge
The United_States_District_Court for the Central_District of California denied the appellants ' motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law ( JMOL ) which sought to overturn the jury verdicts of patent validity and willful_infringement
See Union_Oil_Co. of Cal
v. Atlantic_Richfield_Co. No
CV-95-2379-KMW slip op.at 1 ( C.D.Cal
Mar._10,_1998 ) ( Unocal_I )
In their JMOL motion the Atlantic Richfield Company and other appellant_refiners asserted that Union Oil Company of California 's ( Unocal ) United States Patent No._5288,393 ( '393_patent ) is invalid under 35 U.S.C.¡±¡± 102_and_112_(1994)
The district_court also held that Unocal did not commit inequitable_conduct before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ( PTO )
See Union_Oil_Co. of Cal
v. Atlantic_Richfield_Co. 34_F.Supp.2d_1208 1222 ( C.D.Cal.1998 ) ( Unocal_II )
Because the appellant_refiners did not show a reversible flaw in the jury 's verdict this court affirms the district_court 's denial of JMOL on ¡±¡± 102_and_112 issues
Similarly this court affirms the trial_court 's discretionary judgment of no inequitable_conduct.1

I. Unocal owns the '393_patent which claims automotive_gasoline_compositions that reduce automobile_tailpipe_emissions
Unocal 's original patent application contained 82 claims
As is often the case during the course of prosecution the inventor added and canceled many claims
Ultimately 155 claims issued but Unocal later disclaimed all but the forty-one at issue in this case : claims 20 53 54 56 57 71-75 78 79 81 112-16 117 ( multiply dependent on claims 53 73 78 112 116 and 125 ) claim 120 ( multiply dependent on claims 55 78 79 and 124 ) claim 121 ( dependent on claim 120 and therefore multiply dependent on claims 55 78 79_or_124 ) 125-27 133-35 137 153 and 155
Each claim appears in dependent or multiple *992 dependent form and has from four to six limitations describing ranges for several of the fuel_characteristics
Each claim effectively begins either with the preface `` [ a ] n unleaded gasoline_fuel suitable for combustion in an automotive_engine '' or `` [ a ] n unleaded gasoline_fuel suitable for combustion in a spark ignition automotive_engine ''
As an example Claim 117 as dependent upon claim 116 states:2

117
[ An unleaded gasoline_fuel suitable for combustion in an automotive_engine said fuel having a Reid Vapor pressure no greater than 7.0 psi and a 50 %_D-86_distillation_point no greater than 200¢X_F. and a 90 %_D-86_distillation_point no greater than 300¢X_F. and a paraffin_content greater than 85 volume_percent and an olefin_content less than 4 volume_percent ] wherein the maximum 10 % distillation point is 158¢X_F ( 70¢X C. )
'393_patent col._24,_ll._24-27
As illustrated above the claims do not describe each gasoline product in terms of molecular structures or lists of ingredients
Instead the claims specify the chemical_properties of the gasolines reflecting the way oil_refiners formulate gasoline
When oil_refiners formulate new gasoline products they do so by mixing petroleum stocks
Different stocks have different properties that are known to oil_refiners
The record shows that oil_refiners of ordinary skill in the art change the chemical_properties of gasoline by varying the proportions of different petroleum stocks
Thus the claims which define the invention in terms of various characteristics also inform those of skill in the art of the composition of the claimed gasoline_fuels

Unocal researched extensively the production of automotive gasoline with reduced combustion emissions
Unocal 's scientists Drs
Jessup and Croudace ultimately filed a patent application based on their findings
Their research taught ways to produce cleaner gasoline by varying the following chemical_properties in automotive gasolines : Reid Vapor Pressure ( RVP ) T10 T50 T90 Olefins Paraffins Aromatics,3 and Octane

RVP measures the partial pressure of a gasoline_sample when heated to 100¢X_F in a sealed container
See id.at col._18,_ll._43-47
T10 T50 and T90 are abbreviations for percentage distillation points as measured according to an industry standard procedure called `` D-86 ''
Each corresponds to the temperatures at which a given percentage of the gasoline_sample enters a gaseous phase under specific experimental conditions
Thus T10 is the 10 %_D-86_distillation_point ; TBIG_TOKEN__50_the_50__BIG_TOKEN %_D-86_distillation_point ; and TBIG_TOKEN__90_the_90__BIG_TOKEN %_D-86_distillation_point
The olefins value describes the percentage of the gasoline comprised of olefins measured by volume
Olefins otherwise known as alkenes are open-chain_hydrocarbons that contain at least one double bond
The paraffins value describes the percentage of the gasoline comprised of paraffins measured by volume
Paraffins otherwise known as alkanes are open-chain_hydrocarbons that contain only single bonds
The aromatics value describes the percentage of the gasoline comprised of aromatics measured by volume
Aromatics are compounds whose properties resemble those of 6-carbon ring molecules that have an average of three intra-ring carbon-carbon double bonds ( i.e. benzene )
Octane as used in the '393_patent describes the knocking or detonation characteristics of a gasoline_sample as compared with a reference fuel
The octane value is derived by testing gasoline in a special engine under specified experimental conditions and comparing those results to identically tested reference blends of Isooctane and n-heptane

*993 Drs
Jessup and Croudace sought to reduce the levels of carbon monoxide ( CO ) nitrous oxide ( NOx ) and hydrocarbons ( HC ) emitted from automobile tailpipes
After considerable experimentation Drs
Jessup and Croudace discovered relationships between the various petroleum characteristics described above and tailpipe emissions
Drs
Jessup and Croudace then patented their innovative fuel compositions describing the new compositions by their characteristics

The specification of the '393_patent describes relationships among automotive gasoline characteristics and fuel emissions including the following : 1
Decreasing RVP is of primary_importance and decreasing T10 and olefin_content are of secondary importance for reducing NOx_emissions
See '393_patent col._2,_ll._21-29
2
Decreasing T50 is of primary_importance for reducing CO and HC_emissions
See id.at ll
7-11
3
Increasing paraffin_content and decreasing T50 are most effective for reducing CO emissions
See id.at col._6,_ll._12-28
4
Decreasing both olefin_content and RVP are most effective for reducing NOx_emissions
See id.at ll
28-31
5
HC_emissions are most practically reduced by decreasing olefins and/or T50
See id.at ll
46-50
6
Any combination of the eight characteristics can be increased or decreased as described and that the greater any individual characteristic is changed in the directions indicated the better the result
See id.at col._15,_ll._20-28
The specification also provides specific numerical ranges for each characteristic
For example the specification teaches : 1
CO and HC_emissions can be minimized by reducing TBIG_TOKEN__50_below_215__BIG_TOKEN ¢X_F preferably below 195¢X_F. See id.at col._2,_ll._7-20
2
NOx_emissions can be minimized by ( a ) decreasing RVP to 8.0 psi or less ( preferably below 7.0 psi ) ; ( b ) decreasing olefins below 15 % ( preferably to essentially zero ) ; or ( c ) decreasing TBIG_TOKEN__10_below_140__BIG_TOKEN ¢X_F. See id.at ll
21-34
3
The best NOx reductions are obtained when the olefins are below 15 % RVP is 7.5 psi or less and T10 is below 140¢X_F. See id.at ll
44-50
4
All three pollutants are reduced when TBIG_TOKEN__50_is_215__BIG_TOKEN ¢X_F or less and RVP is 8.0 psi or less with greater_reductions when olefins are below 10 % or T10 is below 140¢X_F and still greater_reductions when both olefins and T10 are reduced
See id.at ll
54-64
5
Further pollution reductions are possible when T50 is below 195¢X > F olefins are below 5 % ( preferably at essentially zero ) T10 is below 120¢X_F and/or when RVP is below 7.0 psi
See id.at l. 64-BIG_TOKEN__col._3 _l._3__BIG_TOKEN
Elsewhere the specification describes the optimal_ranges for five of the eight fuel_characteristics in similar terms

The specification also states that the gasolines are preferably unleaded have an octane rating of at least 90 and fall most preferably within one or more of five volatility classes in American Society for Testing and Materials ( ASTM ) publication D4814-89 ( included in Table 1 of the patent )
See id.at col._4,_l._66- col. 5. l. 13
Beyond the optimal_ranges for individual characteristics the '393_patent also discloses preferred fuel mixtures
In sum the '393 disclosure describes with detail the benefits and methods of varying gasoline characteristics
The specification describes 1 ) the relationships among the eight individual fuel_characteristics and CO NOx and HC_emissions 2 ) characteristics most important for emissions and 3 ) specific desirable ranges for RVP T10 T50 olefins paraffins and aromatics

*994 The appellant_refiners originally sued Unocal in district_court seeking a declaratory_judgment to invalidate the '393_patent
Unocal counterclaimed alleging willful_infringement of the '393_patent
The district_court then construed the claims of the '393_patent effectively converting the refiners ' declaratory_judgment_action into an infringement_defense
Then the district_court tried those invalidity issues to a jury
During forty-nine days of trial the jury heard the testimony of numerous witnesses and considered hundreds of exhibits and demonstrations
See Unocal_I slip op.at 6
At the close of all evidence the district_court properly instructed the jury on the law and presented the jury with a special_verdict_form
The verdict form required the jury to decide validity under ¡± 102 and ¡± 112 separately for each of the forty-one asserted claims
With respect to the ¡± 112 questions the trial_court asked the jury to consider the '393_patent 's specification including the original_claims of the application as filed
See Northern Telecom Inc. v. Datapoint Corp. 908_F.2d_931 938 15_USPQ2d_1321 1326 ( Fed.Cir.1990 ) ( `` The original_claims as filed are part of the patent specification `` )
In total the trial_court 's special_verdict_form asked the jury 223 individual questions
After thirteen days of deliberation the jury returned and answered affirmatively that sufficient written description supported each of the forty-one asserted claims and that none was anticipated under ¡± 102

The appellant_refiners then moved the district_court to overturn the jury 's verdict with a motion for JMOL based on anticipation obviousness and lack of written description
After reviewing arguments of both parties and the record the district_court found that `` substantial evidence exists in the record regarding the written description to support the verdict that Drs
Jessup and Croudace had possession of the claimed subject matter ''
Unocal_I slip op.at 6
The district_court similarly considered and rejected appellant_refiners ' arguments on anticipation and obviousness
See id.at 3-5

The appellant_refiners also argued that the '393_patent was unenforceable for inequitable_conduct
The district_court tried that issue itself and held that the refiners did not meet their burden of showing inequitable_conduct by clear and convincing evidence
See Unocal_II 34 F.Supp.2d at 1222
The district_court found the case exceptional and therefore also awarded attorney_fees to Unocal under 35 U.S.C.¡± 285 ( 1994 )

The appellant_refiners now appeal the district_court 's denial of JMOL on anticipation and written description
They also appeal the district_court 's inequitable_conduct decision
