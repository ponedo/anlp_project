Methods involving `` open_outcry '' and `` trade_capture '' The ¡¬580_patent pertains to automated methods and systems for trading financial_instruments particularly fixed income_securities
Prior to the development of the invention described in the ¡¬580_patent financial_instruments were sold using an `` open-outcry '' method whereby `` voice_brokers '' would express various bid and offer prices for a given instrument
¡¬580_patent col.3 ll.6-9
According to the ¡¬580_patent `` [ t ] his expression would involve the loud oral 'cry ' of a customer-proposed bid or offer and the coordination with the fellow representatives regarding the extraction of complementary positions-until a transaction match is made and a deal is done ''
Id.at_col.3 ll.9-12
Open outcry auction bond brokering served its customers well because it was efficient and permitted trading at `` near perfect market pricing ''
Id.at col.2 ll.64-66

While voice_brokers were participating in open_outcry trading a process known as `` trade_capture '' was performed by designated clerks
Id.at_col.3 ll.13-18
These clerks would attempt to record the `` outcry of many individual brokers simultaneously '' using electronic input devices such as a computer or workstation
Id.at_col.3 ll.18-21
As might be apparent from its description the quality of the information inputted into the electronic devices by a clerk was `` a function of the interpretative skill of the input clerk and the volume and the volatility of customer orders ''
Id.at_col.3 ll.22-23

The inventors of the ¡¬580_patent recognized that there was a need for greater efficiency and accuracy in the trading of instruments such as fixed income_securities
Id.at_col.3 l.29-col.4 l.3
Therefore they sought to create a system to automate the trading process and avoid the use of open_outcry and trade_capture processes
