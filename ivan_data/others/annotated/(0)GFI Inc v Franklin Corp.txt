Background
GFI filed an application on January 3 1991 for a patent on a sectional_sofa in which a pair of reclining_seats on the same side of a wedge is separated by a fixed console which contains the control means for the reclining_seats
GFI then filed a Petition to Make Special to expedite its consideration
After an initial rejection GFI met with the examiner on June_12,_1991
The application issued as the ¡¬244_patent on November 12 1991

During the prosecution of the ¡¬244_patent GFI entered discussions with Walter Durling a furniture designer from Mississippi who designed and built a loveseat-like unit consisting of two recliners joined by a middle console
Durling filed a patent application on this design two months before the ¡¬244_patent application was filed
The discussions between GFI and Durling centered on extracting information from Durling regarding his conception and reduction to practice of the design
The application did not specify the location of the recliner controls but Sproule the named inventor of the ¡¬244_patent saw a model of the Durling furniture in late October or early November of 1990 that had console-mounted controls
Durling offered to exchange his conception information for similar information about the conception and reduction to practice of the invention underlying the ¡¬244_patent ; GFI refused
In 1997 GFI brought suit for patent infringement against Franklin Astro Parkhill and Washington ( collectively `` Franklin '' )
The defenses of inequitable_conduct obviousness laches equitable estoppel and patent misuse were tried to the court in a non-jury trial
