United States Court of Appeals Federal Circuit
LIGHTING BALLAST CONTROL LLC Plaintiff-Appellee
v. PHILIPS ELECTRONICS NORTH AMERICA CORPORATION Defendant
Universal Lighting Technologies Inc. Defendant-Appellant
No._2012-1014
| June_23,_2015
Synopsis
Background : Assignee brought action claiming infringement of lighting ballast_patent
The United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas Reed O'Connor J. 2010_WL_4946343 construed the claims and granted judgment for assignee after jury verdict in its favor
On appeal a Court of Appeals panel reversed 498_Fed.Appx._986 but assignee 's subsequent request for rehearing en banc was granted 500_Fed.Appx._951 and the Court of Appeals 744_F.3d_1272 reinstated the decision
The Supreme_Court -- - U.S. -- -- 135_S.Ct._1173 191_L.Ed.2d_130 vacated and remanded after granting petition for certiorari

Holdings : On remand the Court of Appeals Reyna Circuit_Judge held that :

competitor was not required to object to jury instructions to preserve issue for appeal as to whether term `` voltage_source means '' in lighting ballast_patent was invalid for indefiniteness ;

claims conveyed defined structure to one of ordinary_skill in the art and thus term `` voltage_source means '' in lighting ballast_patent was not invalid for indefiniteness ;

district court could rely on extrinsic evidence to determine whether claim in lighting ballast_patent conveyed defined structure to one of ordinary_skill in the art ;

competitor had to present the invalidity question to the jury in order to preserve its right to raise it on appeal ;

term `` direct_current_blocking_means '' required capacitor or diode at every output terminal ;

substantial_evidence supported jury 's verdict that `` direct_current_blocking_means '' claim had not been anticipated by prior art ;

term `` defective '' meant whenever direct current path between two terminals was broken ; and

substantial_evidence supported jury 's verdict that competitor infringed `` control_means '' claim

Opinion
REYNA Circuit_Judge
This case returns to us on remand from the Supreme_Court of the United States and was returned to the panel for reconsideration in light of *1334 Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. v. Sandoz Inc. 574 U.S. -- -- 135_S.Ct._831 -- -L.Ed.2d -- -- ( 2015 )
Appellant Universal Lighting Technologies Inc. ( `` ULT '' ) appeals four issues

BACKGROUND OF THE TECHNOLOGY
High levels of current are required to cause a fluorescent lamp to emit visible light
As the panel explained in the initial panel opinion in this case Lighting Ballast Control LLC v. Philips Elecs
N. Am Corp. ( `` Lighting Ballast I `` ) 498_Fed.Appx._986 ( Fed.Cir.2013 ) fluorescent lamp fixtures typically include an electronic_ballast to regulate electric current flow
An electronic_ballast is a device that maintains current levels high enough to start the lamp but that prevents current from reaching destructive_levels
When a lamp is removed from its holders or when a filament is broken current provided by the ballast suddenly ceases to flow through the lamp and dissipates back into the ballast circuitry
The dissipated current can destroy the ballast and create an electric shock hazard for someone servicing the lamp

U.S. Patent No._5436,529 ( `` the ¡¬529_patent `` ) assigned to Lighting Ballast LLC ( `` Lighting Ballast '' ) discloses an electronic_ballast with the ability to shield itself from destructive_levels of current when a lamp is removed or becomes defective

Claim 1 recites : 1
An energy conversion device employing an oscillating resonant converter producing oscillations having DC_input_terminals producing a control_signal and adapted to power at least one gas_discharge_lamp having heatable filaments the device comprising : voltage_source means providing a constant or variable magnitude DC voltage between the DC_input_terminals ; output_terminals connected to the filaments of the gas_discharge_lamp ; control_means capable of receiving control_signals from the DC_input_terminals and from the resonant converter and operable to effectively initiate the oscillations and to effectively stop the oscillations of the converter ; and direct_current_blocking_means coupled to the output_terminals and operable to stop flow of the control_signal from the DC_input_terminals whenever at least one gas_discharge_lamp is removed from the output_terminals or is defective
