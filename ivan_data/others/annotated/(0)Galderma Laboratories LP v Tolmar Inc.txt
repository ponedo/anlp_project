In this patent infringement case Tolmar Inc. challenges the district_court 's holding that the claims of U.S. Patent Nos._7579,377 ( '377_patent ) ; 7,737,181 ( '181_patent ) ; 7,834,060 ( '060_patent ) ; 7,838,558 ( '558_patent ) ; and 7,868,044 ( '044_patent ) which are owned by Galderma Laboratories L.P. Galderma_S.A. and Galderma_Research and Development S.N.C

We find that the district_court erred in finding the claims of the asserted patents not invalid as obvious
Accordingly we reverse

BACKGROUND
This Hatch-Waxman case is based on Tolmar 's filing of an Abbreviated New Drug Application ( `` ANDA '' ) seeking approval to market a generic version of DifferinTHE_R Gel 0.3 % which is a topical medication containing 0.3 % by weight adapalene approved for the treatment of acne
On January 21 2010 Galderma sued Tolmar in the United_States_District_Court for the District of Delaware alleging that Tolmar 's ANDA product infringed certain claims of the ¡¬377_patent
Galderma subsequently filed amended complaints alleging infringement of each of the asserted patents
After a bench trial the district_court ruled against Tolmar on several issues of which only invalidity under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103 is at issue in this appeal
