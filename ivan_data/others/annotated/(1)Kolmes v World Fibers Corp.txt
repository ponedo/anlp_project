Synopsis
Patentee brought action against alleged_infringer of patent for cut-resistant_yarn used in making cut-resistant_gloves
The United_States_District_Court for the Middle_District of North_Carolina William L. Osteen Sr. J. found that patent was not invalid that patent was not obtained by means of inequitable_conduct and that patent was infringed and awarded damages based upon reasonable_royalty
Alleged infringer appealed
The Court of Appeals Lourie Circuit_Judge held that : ( 1 ) patent specification contained sufficient written description of claimed wrapping rate for yarn 's two strand core ; ( 2 ) distribution of gloves before critical_date was for experimental purposes and patent was thus not invalid under statutory on-sale bar ; ( 3 ) patent was not invalid as obvious ; ( 4 ) patentee did not engage in inequitable_conduct ; ( 5 ) documents offered by alleged_infringer did not satisfy business records exception to hearsay rule ; ( 6 ) alleged_infringer was not entitled to damages or attorney fees ; and ( 7 ) patentee was not entitled to damages for frivolous appeal

Opinion
LOURIE Circuit_Judge
World Fibers Corporation appeals from the judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the Middle_District of North_Carolina holding that U.S._Patent 5,177,948 is not invalid and that it was not obtained by means of inequitable_conduct
It also appeals from the court 's ruling denying entry into evidence of documents that it offered in an attempt to prove invalidity
Kolmes v. World Elastic Corp. No._4 :93CV00719 ( M.D.N.C
Sept._18,_1995 )
World does not appeal the court 's added finding of infringement
Because the district_court did not err in its holding concerning validity and did not abuse its discretion on the issue of inequitable_conduct and in its evidentiary ruling we affirm

BACKGROUND
The '948_patent concerns a cut-resistant_yarn for use in making inter alia cut-resistant_gloves
The prior art cut-resistant_yarns typically used wire which was undesirable because it restricted movement and was readily breakable
The '948 invention improved upon this material by using non-metallic components
Figure 1 of the patent reproduced below illustrates an embodiment of the yarn of the patent ( 10 )
It includes two core_strands ( 12 14 ) and two covering strands ( 16 18 ) wrapped around the core_strands in opposite_directions relative to each other
One of the core_strands comprises fiberglass
The other core strand and the covering strands typically comprise nylon extended chain polyethylene aramid or polyester

?
-- -- - Claim 1 reads as follows
1
A non-metallic composite cut-resistant_yarn for use in making strong flexible cut-resistant products comprising : ( a ) a non-metallic core including at least one strand of fiberglass said at least one strand having a denier in the range of 375-1,000 and being substantially parallel to *1538 and untwisted with another strand in said core ; ( b ) a non-metallic covering wrapped on said core said covering including at least tow [ sic two ] strands unbraided and spirally wrapped in opposite_directions relative to each other around the core said composite cut-resistant_yarn having a composite denier between about 2,000 and about 5,000 ; ( c ) said two strands in said covering being spirally wrapped about said core at the rate of 8-12 turns per inch ; whereby said composite yarn may be formed into fabric on conventional knitting or weaving machines

Nathaniel H. Kolmes and Harold_F._Plemmons ( collectively `` Kolmes '' ) filed their first application for patent relating to this subject matter on June_13,_1989
They filed a continuation-in-part application on March_2,_1990 and a continuation_application on January 15 1992
This latter application filed under 37 C.F.R.¡± 1.62 and using the same specification as the 1990 application properly claimed the benefit of the filing_date of the 1990 application under 35 U.S.C.¡± 120
It was accompanied by additional_claims which became part of the granted patent
It eventually became the '948_patent
In denying Kolmes ' motion for a preliminary injunction the district_court found that the continuation_application and hence the '948_patent was not entitled to the benefit of the filing_date of the 1989 application and that finding has not been challenged on appeal
Thus the additional_claims of the patent have an effective filing_date of March_2,_1990 and a critical_date of March_2,_1989 for purposes of 35 U.S.C.¡± 102 ( b ) if they are adequately described in the specification

Before the critical_date sample gloves made from the new yarn were sent to certain of Kolmes ' customers for testing
In particular the district_court found that these activities were documented by six `` sales '' records two dated September 11 1988 and four dated February 21 1989
A typical use of the yarn was in making cut-resistant_gloves for use in meat-packing plants and Kolmes thus sent the gloves out for testing in order to see whether they would work in that environment and withstand repeated laundering

Kolmes sued World for infringement
The district_court conducted a bench trial concluding that the '948_patent was not invalid
It found that the 1990 application adequately supported the claims added in the 1992 continuation_application
With respect to the on-sale and public use bars the court found that gloves distributed before the critical_date were marked `` sample '' and were sent with a `` sample sheet '' free of charge
They were in experimental use and thus did not create a statutory bar

The court also found that the patent was not invalid on the ground of obviousness over U.S._Patent 5,119,512 ( `` the Dunbar_patent '' ) and U.S._Patent 4,886,691 ( `` the Wincklhofer_patent '' ) which it found to be most pertinent
The Wincklhofer_patent discloses the use of wire in yarn which the court found was different from the claimed non-metallic yarn of the '948_patent
The court found that the inventors proved they made their invention before the filing_date of the Dunbar_patent thereby removing it as prior art
The district_court found that no inequitable_conduct occurred in the failure of the patentees to submit to the Patent and Trademark Office ( `` PTO '' ) the Wincklhofer_patent the Dunbar_patent and evidence of pre-critical_date sales activity
Finally the district_court found that World infringed the '948_patent and awarded damages based upon a reasonable_royalty of ten percent
World now appeals certain of these conclusions to this court
