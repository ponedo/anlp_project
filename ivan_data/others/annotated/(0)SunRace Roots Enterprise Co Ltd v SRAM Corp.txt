Opinion
BRYSON Circuit_Judge
SRAM Corporation appeals from an order of the United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of California granting SunRace Roots Enterprise Co. Ltd. and Sun_Victory_Trading_Co. Inc. ( collectively `` SunRace '' ) a declaratory_judgment of noninfringement of SRAM 's patent relating to bicycle_gear-shifting devices
Because we conclude that the district court erred in construing the term `` shift_actuator '' as used in SRAM 's patent we reverse and remand

I. SRAM owns U.S. Patent No._4900,291 ( `` the ¡¬291_patent `` ) and produces shift_actuators known as `` twist-shifters '' that allow a bicycle_rider to change gears by twisting a portion of the handlebar
A bicycle_gear-shifting system typically includes a shifter ( or `` shift_actuator '' ) at or near the handlebars a derailleur to control the chain and a control cable that connects the shifter and the derailleur

The ¡¬291_patent contains both method and apparatus claims related to gear-shifting on multi-speed bicycles through the use of a shift_actuator that is designed to effect precise control over the movement of the derailleur
In a system that uses indexed shifting the shift_actuator moves a discrete amount to cause the derailleur to move the bicycle chain the precise distance necessary to effect a gear shift
One way that indexed shifting can be implemented in a twist-shifter is through the use of a cam mechanism
In such a system the cylindrical cam member fits over the handlebar and the cam operating face ( consisting of peaks and valleys ) interacts with a cam pin as the shift_actuator is rotated
The apparatus claims of the ¡¬291_patent include the limitation of a `` handgrip shift_actuator cam means '' or a `` handgrip shift_actuator indexing cam means '' while the method claims including claim 16 employ the term `` shift_actuator '' without reference to a cam

The written description of the ¡¬291_patent recites the objects of the invention
They include providing a derailleur shifting system with a shift_actuator that is rotatably mounted on the handlebar so that the bicycle_rider need not remove his hands from the handlebar to shift gears ; *1300 providing a derailleur shifting system having a handgrip shift_actuator embodying a generally helical cam that defines the derailleur mechanism movements ; providing a derailleur shifting system that compensates for `` cumulative lost motion '' ( the amount the shifter must move in order to take up any slack in the system before the derailleur begins to move ) in the derailleur mechanism and its cable to enable precise index shifting ; and providing a derailleur shifting system that produces an optimum amount of overshift when down-shifting without requiring manual input to define that overshift
Overshifting is `` movement of the chain beyond the destination_sprocket and then back into alignment with the destination_sprocket '' ¡¬291_patent col._1,_ll._52-55 ; in essence the cable is moved farther than necessary so that the derailleur is more easily aligned with the appropriate sprocket during down-shifting

The written description states that `` [ a ] pplicant has found that for accurate index shifting substantially all of th [ e ] cumulative lost motion must first be taken up at the shift_actuator before the actual shift increment of travel between adjacent sprockets is applied during a down-shifting event
Applicant is not aware of any specific consideration of this problem in the prior art ''
¡¬291_patent col._2,_ll._61-67
Original claim 16 recited a method for down-shifting from a smaller sprocket to a larger_sprocket in which the movement of the shift_actuator first takes up the cumulative lost motion and then transfers the chain to the larger_sprocket
