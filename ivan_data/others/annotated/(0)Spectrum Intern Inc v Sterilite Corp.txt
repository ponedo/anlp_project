Opinion
CLEVENGER Circuit_Judge
Spectrum International Inc. ( `` Spectrum '' ) appeals the summary_judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the Southern_District of New_York that Sterilite Corporation 's ( `` Sterilite '' ) storage crates do not infringe claims 2_and_11 in Spectrum 's reexamined U.S. Patent No._4971,202 ( `` the '202_patent '' originally issued November 20 1990 reexamination certificate B1 4,971,202 issued May_27,_1997 ) either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents
See No._96- CIV-8017 ( WK ) ( S.D.N.Y
Jan._27,_1998 )
Because in view of the '202_patent 's prosecution history any infringement by Sterilite 's accused crates can not lie as a matter of law we affirm albeit on a different rationale than the one articulated by the district_court
See Stratoflex Inc. v. Aeroquip Corp. 713_F.2d_1530 1540 218_USPQ_871 880 ( Fed.Cir.1983 ) ( `` We sit to review judgments not opinions
`` )

I
Titled `` Stackable Recycling Crate '' the '202_patent is directed to `` a box-like structure with four walls and a bottom ''
'202_patent at Col. 2 lines 67-68
Like an ordinary uncovered box the '202 crate contains a bottom_side two side walls a front_wall and a back_wall
Two features alter the typical configuration of a box to enable simultaneously *1374 the placement of large articles in the crate when stacked in tandem with other crates of its kind while retaining the articles within the confines of the crate once the articles have been so placed
First the upper and lower_portions of the front_wall are cut out such that when stacked the upper cut-out portion of each lower crate and the lower cut-out portion of each upper crate together form a large overall opening into which articles may be easily placed
Second the front portion of the bottom_side tapers to an incline that joins the central_portion of the front_wall forming an internal storage compartment that is further enclosed laterally by the side portions or `` legs '' of the front_wall remaining after the upper and lower_portions of the front_wall have been excised

The '202_patent originally recited 16 claims
The broadest original claim claim 1 reads as follows : 1
A stackable crate comprising : ( a ) a pair of opposing sidewalls ; ( b ) a back_wall coupled to the sidewalls ; ( c ) a front_wall coupled to the sidewalls and having a first substantially rectangularly shaped opening at the top portion of the front_wall and a second substantially rectangularly shaped opening at the bottom portion of the front_wall thereby defining in the front_wall a central_portion with the bottom_edge of the central_portion extending to form at each end a lower leg segment and the top_edge of the central_portion extending to form at each end an upper leg segment ; and
( d ) a bottom_side being planar as the bottom_side extends away from the back_wall and tapering upwardly to merge with the central_portion wherein the bottom_side as joined to the sidewalls and to the back_wall to define a storage compartment in the interior of the crate

On January 3 1994 Spectrum apprised Sterilite of its view that Sterilite 's `` Storage_Cart '' product may infringe the '202_patent
On that same day Spectrum also mailed a request for reexamination to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ( `` PTO '' )
A protracted 30-month reexamination proceeding ensued culminating in a decision by the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences mailed July_26,_1996 affirming the examiner 's final rejection of 11 out of the original 16 claims including claim 1
Only claims 2 11 and 14-16 survived reexamination
Claims 14-16 are not pertinent to this appeal and will not be further discussed

Claims 2_and_11 each contain the requirement that the bottom_side of the crate merge with at least a substantial portion of the bottom_edge of the central_portion of the crate 's front_wall
See '202_patent at Col. 5 lines 24-26 ; Col. 6 lines 4-7.1 During reexamination the examiner lodged a rejection of claims 2_and_11 over a prior_art_crate shown in Figure 1 disclosed in DePutter U.S. Patent No._3682,351 ( `` DePutter '' )

?
To rebut the rejection Spectrum argued that in the prior_art_crate the bottom_side merges with the top_edge of the central_portion of the front_wall but not the bottom_edge
The PTO sustained the patentability of claims 2_and_11 solely on the basis of this argument

Armed with its Board decision Spectrum filed suit in the Southern_District of New_York on October 24 1996 charging Sterilite with infringement of claims 2_and_11 by the `` Storage_Cart '' illustrated in Figure 2 :
