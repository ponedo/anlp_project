* Synopsis
Patentee brought action against competitor alleging competitor infringed patents on process for making solid formulation of enalapril_sodium for use in treatment of high_blood_pressure
The United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of Illinois 2000_WL_97582 Matthew F. Kennelly J. granted competitor 's motion for summary_judgment on grounds patents were invalid and patentee appealed
The Court of Appeals Lourie Circuit_Judge held that : ( 1 ) statute under which patent was invalid if invention was previously made `` in this country by another inventor who had not abandoned suppressed or concealed it '' did not limit proof negating suppression or concealment to activities occurring within the United_States ; ( 2 ) competitor in asserting invalidity of patent on ground of prior_invention had to rebut any alleged suppression or concealment with clear and convincing evidence to the contrary ; ( 3 ) patentee successfully discharged its burden of going forward with evidence creating a genuine issue of material fact of suppression or concealment ; but ( 4 ) competitor the first inventor of the process for manufacturing its own patented product succeeded in rebutting by clear and convincing evidence inference of suppression or concealment created by its five-year period of inactivity in disclosing invention and thus established invalidity of patents at issue based on its prior_invention

Opinion
LOURIE Circuit_Judge
Apotex USA Inc. appeals from the decision of the United_States_District_Court for the Northern_District of Illinois granting Merck & Co. Inc. 's motion for summary_judgment that the claims of U.S
Patents 5,573 780_and_5690,962 are invalid under 35 U.S.C.¡± 102 ( g )
Apotex_Corp. v. Merck & Co. No._96-_C-7375 2000_WL_97582 ( N.D.Ill
Jan.25 2000 ) ( `` Apotex I `` )
Because the district_court did not err in granting summary_judgment that the ¡¬780 and ¡¬ 962 patents are invalid under 35 U.S.C.¡± 102 ( g ) we affirm

BACKGROUND
Apotex is the assignee of the ¡¬780 and ¡¬962_patent s which relate to a process for making a stable solid formulation of enalapril_sodium for use in the treatment of high_blood_pressure
Apotex I at *1
Claim 1 of the ¡¬ 780 patent which is representative of the claims at issue reads as follows : 1
A process of manufacture of a pharmaceutical solid composition comprising enalapril_sodium which process comprises the steps of : i ) a ) mixing enalapril_maleate with an alkaline_sodium_compound and at least one other excipient adding water sufficient to moisten and mixing to achieve a wet_mass or
b ) mixing enalapril_maleate with at least one excipient other than an alkaline_sodium_compound adding a solution of an alkaline_sodium_compound in water sufficient to moisten and mixing to achieve a wet_mass ; thereby to achieve a reaction without converting the enalapril_maleate to a clear solution of enalapril_sodium and maleic acid sodium salt in water ii ) drying the wet_mass and
*1034 iii ) further processing the dried material into tablets
'780_patent col._5,_l._34 to col._6,_l._15
The claims of the ¡¬962_patent which is a continuation of the application that led to the ¡¬780_patent are identical to those found in the ¡¬780_patent except that they are not restricted to tablet form but rather encompass any solid pharmaceutical dosage form of enalapril_sodium
¡¬962_patent col._5,_l._22 to col._6,_l._11
This distinction is not material to the resolution of this appeal

Merck manufactures enalapril_sodium under the trade name VASOTECTHE_R and has been continuously manufacturing and commercially selling VASOTECTHE_R tablets since 1983
Apotex I at *7
Merck owns both U.S. and Canadian patents covering the enalapril_sodium_compound but does not own a patent covering its process of manufacturing_VASOTECTHE_R
Id.at *1
However in 1992 Merck disclosed the ingredients utilized in its VASOTECTHE_R manufacturing process in a Canadian product monograph and more than 30,000 copies of the monograph were distributed in 1993 alone
Id.at *7
Merck also disclosed the ingredients used in manufacturing RENITECTHE_R ( the trademark used for its enalapril_sodium product sold in various foreign countries ) in the 1988 edition of the Dictionnaire Vidal a French pharmaceutical dictionary
Id

In 1991 Merck and its Canadian subsidiary Merck Frosst Canada Inc. sued Apotex 's Canadian affiliate Apotex Canada for infringement of Merck 's Canadian patent covering the enalapril_sodium_compound
Id.at *1
During the 1994 trial ( `` the Canadian trial '' ) Brian McLeod Merck 's then-vice president of marketing performed a step-by-step narration of a videotape demonstrating Merck 's process of manufacturing_VASOTECTHE_R
Id
Within days of hearing this testimony Dr. Bernard Sherman an Apotex official allegedly conceived the patented process at issue
Id

Apotex filed the present action against Merck alleging that Merck 's process of manufacturing_VASOTECTHE_R infringes all of the claims of both the ¡¬ 780 and ¡¬962_patent s. Id
Both parties filed cross-motions for summary_judgment on the issue of infringement and Merck cross-moved for summary_judgment of invalidity under ¡± 102 ( g )
Id
The district_court granted Apotex 's motion for summary_judgment of infringement but also granted Merck 's cross-motion for summary_judgment of invalidity because it found that Merck invented the process claimed in the ¡¬780 and ¡¬962_patent s within the United_States before Apotex and did not abandon suppress or conceal that invention within the meaning of ¡± 102 ( g )
Id.at *9

Apotex thereafter filed a motion asking the court to reconsider its grant of summary_judgment of invalidity which the district_court denied
Apotex_Corp. v. Merck & Co. No._96-_C-7375 2000_WL_656670 ( N.D.Ill
Mar.17 2000 )
Apotex appeals from the district_court 's grant of summary_judgment of invalidity
We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( 1994 )
