Opinion
PAULINE NEWMAN Circuit_Judge
Interconnect Planning Corporation ( IPC ) appeals from the summary_judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the Southern_District of New_York Interconnect_Planning_Corp. v. Feil 587_F.Supp._1495 223_USPQ_961_(S.D.N.Y.1984) holding invalid all the claims of IPC 's Reissue_Patent_No._31144 entitled `` Multi Station Telephone Switching System '' invention of Thomas E. Feil for failure to meet the conditions for patent validity under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103 and dismissing IPC 's count for patent_infringement
We hold that invalidity under ¡± 103 has not been proven as a matter of law
We vacate the summary_judgment of invalidity and dismissal of the infringement count and remand to the district_court

Background
The claims of Reissue_Patent_No._31144 are for certain telephone systems known as `` trader_turrets '' which are multi-line telephone consoles used by the financial community in trading networks for securities commodities currency and the like
The purpose of these systems is to facilitate concurrent telephone connections for traders requiring multiple sources of price information conducting multiple transactions and generally meeting the communication demands of busy often hectic financial trading enterprises
Trading rooms may house a hundred or more trader_turrets

Because of the large number of lines and connections required and the specific needs of these communication networks these systems are complex
A high degree of reliability is required in their operation because even momentary failures can be extremely costly

The record shows that the Feil_trader_turrets rapidly achieved commercial success displacing other systems then in use
IPC attributes the success of the Feil invention to its novel system `` architecture '' which enabled ease of operation high capacity and improved reliability over the systems then available
IPC 's sales of the Feil_trader_turrets according to the record grew from $ 320 000_for_20 units in 1974 its first year to $ 27,900 000_for_3500 units in 1983

Thomas_Feil the inventor was formerly an officer and part owner of IPC
In 1977 Mr._Feil formed the defendant company V_Band Systems Inc. and in 1980 Mr._Feil left IPC and joined V_Band of which he is president and chief executive officer
Defendants make and sell the trader_turrets that are here accused of patent_infringement

On November 21 1980 IPC filed suit in the Southern_District of New_York asserting infringement of U.S. Patent No._3991,282 ( the '282_patent ) invention of Thomas_Feil
Defendants Feil and V_Band raised the defense this patent was invalid in terms of 35 U.S.C.¡± 103
IPC 's count for unfair competition was dismissed by the court and is not before us
Various counterclaims were separated and are apparently still pending

In May of 1981 IPC filed in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ( the PTO ) an application to reissue the '282_patent
IPC cited to the examiner articles by M.E
Ozenberger and W.H
Keith both of the Bell Telephone Laboratories on which articles defendants were relying before the district_court and which had not previously been before the examiner
The district_court refused to stay the action before it pending completion of the reissue_examination and therefore the reissue_examination was suspended by the PTO in accordance with its rules
On defendants ' motion for summary_judgment the district_court on June_1,_1982 held all claims of the '282_patent invalid for obviousness under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103
Interconnect_Planning_Corp. v. Feil 543_F.Supp._610 614-19 215_USPQ_734 736-41 ( S.D.N.Y.1982 )

Following this decision at IPC 's request the PTO resumed examination of the reissue_application
The court 's decision was provided to and considered by the examiner
*1135 A supplemental reissue declaration by IPC referred to this decision as a basis for the reissue_application
The '282_patent was surrendered and on February 8 1983 the PTO granted the reissue_patent RE 31,144 IPC having restricted its claims in various ways and having overcome the newly cited prior art

Defendants moved for summary_judgment of invalidity of the reissue_patent asserting collateral estoppel based on the court 's decision on the '282_patent and also asserting invalidity under 35 U.S.C.¡± 103
IPC resisted the motion and the parties ' memoranda affidavits depositions and other documents are of record
For reasons similar to those of the 1982 decision the motion for summary_judgment was granted on June_20,_1984

That decision holding all of the reissue claims invalid was certified and made final under Fed.R.Civ.P
54 ( b ) with instructions by the court that IPC `` attempt to have any appeal.. heard at the same time and before the same panel '' as any appeal from a decision on the same patent by the United_States_District_Court for the District of New Jersey.1 We agreed
Both appeals are decided this day

Although both appeals involved similar issues and argument specific to the New_York suit are certain procedural issues as discussed infra
