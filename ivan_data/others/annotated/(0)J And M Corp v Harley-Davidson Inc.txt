ARCHER Senior_Circuit_Judge
J & M Corporation John_Lazzeroni and Melinda_K._Carevich ( `` J & M '' ) appeal from the summary_judgment of the United_States_District_Court for the District of Arizona
The district_court held that U.S. Reissue Patent Number 34,525 is not infringed by the motorcycle_helmet_accessories manufactured and distributed by Harley-Davidson Inc. and Radio_Sound Inc. ( `` Harley-Davidson '' )
J & M_Corp. v. Harley-Davidson Inc. No
CIV 97-2353-PHX-RCB ( D.Ariz
Feb._10,_2000 ) ( `` J & M_II `` )
Harley-Davidson_cross-appeals the court 's conclusion that J & M was not estopped from asserting infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
Because the court correctly concluded that the accused accessories do not infringe literally or under the doctrine of equivalents we affirm

BACKGROUND
J & M is the exclusive licensee of Reissue Patent Number 34,525 ( `` the ¡¬525_patent `` ) directed to helmet_accessories for mounting a microphone and an electrical_plug on a motorcycle_helmet
The microphone and electrical_plug form part of an audio system that allows motorcyclists to communicate with companions while riding
J & M 's patented accessories have two components a microphone_mount and a plug_mount
The microphone_mount secures a microphone_boom that may be positioned near a motorcyclist 's mouth
The plug_mount secures an electrical_plug that receives wires from the microphone_mount and from earphones mounted in the helmet interior
The electrical_plug also mates with a second electrical_plug that receives wires leading to electronic audio equipment attached to the motorcycle frame

John and Melinda Lazzeroni ( `` Applicants '' ) filed the application that led to the ¡¬525_patent on December 8 1988
Helmet_accessories for mounting a microphone and electrical_plug on a motorcycle_helmet were known as of this filing date but Applicants claimed accessories that allegedly were superior to the prior art
As stated in the written description some prior art accessories were mounted via holes drilled into the helmet causing undesirable damage to the motorcycle_helmet
¡¬525_patent col._1,_l._63- col._2,_l._5
A second type of prior art accessory was mounted to the helmet with clamps and therefore avoided the problem of damaging the helmet
Such accessories had a separate problem however in that the clamped accessories extended down below the bottom edge of the motorcycle_helmet creating a bulky object that would annoyingly strike a motorcyclist 's shoulder when the head was turned
This problem was exacerbated in other accessories in which the microphone_mount was attached to the electrical_plug_mount creating an even larger object extending below the lower_edge of the helmet
Id.at col._2,_ll._5-11

Applicants claimed accessories that avoided these problems
Their accessories attached to the lower_edge of the motorcycle_helmet by clamps with the microphone_mount and the electrical_plug_mount separately clamped to the helmet so that they were positioned above the lower_edge of the motorcycle_helmet
Applicants ' accessories therefore did not damage the motorcycle *1363 helmet and did not protrude below the rim of the motorcycle_helmet

Claims 1-3 of United States Patent Number 4,788,724 ( `` the ¡¬724_patent `` ) which were also allowed in the reissued ¡¬525_patent read in pertinent part as follows : 1
Helmet_accessories for helmets of the type having an opening for viewing and receiving the head of a wearer the helmet opening having a lower_side_edge with adjacent inside and outside helmet surfaces above the lower_side_edge said helmet_accessories placing a microphone attached at the end of a boom proximate the helmet wearer 's mouth ; and
a microphone_mount for attachment to an associated helmet said microphone_mount adapted to receive and secure an associated microphone_boom for placing the microphone proximate the wearer 's mouth ; and
a plug_mount for attachment to the associated helmet proximate said microphone_mount said plug_mount adapted to receive and secure an associated electrical_plug and provide for electrical connection from the electrical_plug to the microphone secured by the microphone_mount to the associated earphones located in the helmet and to associated audio_instruments located distal to the helmet ; both said microphone_mount and said plug_mount each including an attached clamp_portion engaging the lower_side_edge of the associated helmet said clamp_portion comprising an outside elongated jaw and an inside elongated jaw.. whereby said microphone_mount and plug_mount secure the microphone in position and provide for electrical connections in order that the wearer may utilize the associated microphone earphones and audio_instruments
2
The helmet_accessories as defined in claim 1 wherein said microphone_mount includes a microphone_boom_seat attached to said outside jaw said seat adapted to receive and secure the boom of a microphone and to provide means for wires associated with the microphone to exit said seat
3
The helmet_accessories as defined in claim 2 wherein said microphone_boom_seat is attached to said outside jaw proximate said second end said microphone_boom_seat thereby located proximate the outside surface of the helmet above the helmet edge
( Emphasis added )
Claims 4-7 also at issue in this case depend from claims 1_and_3 and add additional limitations that are not relevant to this appeal

Applicants later determined that their patent failed to claim the full subject matter to which they were entitled and sought a reissue patent to more broadly claim their invention
In their Reissue Declaration Applicants argued that their invention `` properly includes within its scope an embodiment wherein the microphone_boom and the electrical_plug are both attached to a single element.. '' Accordingly Applicants asserted new_claims 15-20 in the reissue proceedings that encompassed an accessory where the microphone_mount and plug_mount were clamped to the helmet by a single_pair of jaws
The examiner rejected these claims under 35 U.S.C.¡± 112 ?
1 35 U.S.C.¡± 112 ?
2 and 35 U.S.C.¡± 251
The examiner explained that the specification `` fail [ ed ] to support the subject matter of claims 15_through_20 directed to a microphone_boom and an electrical_plug_mounted on the same jaw pair ''
The examiner further commented that these new_claims improperly `` introduced new matter into the application '' since `` [ t ] he concept of both such mounts occurring on a single_pair of jaws is not present in the original patent ''

*1364 In response Applicants cancelled the rejected claims and proposed new_claims drafted in a means-plus-function format
These claims broadly recited `` gripping means '' for attaching the microphone_mount and electrical_plug_mount to the motorcycle_helmet
After further amendment claims in this format were eventually allowed as claims 15-17 of the reissue patent.1 Applicants ' patent was reissued as the ¡¬525_patent on February 1 1994 with new_claims 15-17 and with claims 1-14 essentially the same as in the ¡¬724_patent

Harley-Davidson began buying J & M 's helmet_accessories in late 1987 or early 1988
These accessories were a commercial embodiment of the ¡¬724_patent and had separate microphone_boom mounts and electrical_plug_mounts that attached to the helmet via separate_clamps
Harley-Davidson continued to buy accessories from J & M until 1991
In the summer of 1989 however Harley-Davidson approached Radio_Sound about manufacturing accessories for resale by Harley-Davidson

Harley-Davidson and Radio_Sound produced their first accessories in 1990
When mounted these accessories extended below the lower_edge of the motorcycle_helmet
In 1997 Radio_Sound and Harley-Davidson began to manufacture and sell two new versions of their helmet_accessories model numbers 77147-BIG_TOKEN__98_and_77147__BIG_TOKEN -91C
These accessories have an integrated mount for the microphone_boom and the electrical_plug attach to the helmet with a single_clamp and do not extend below the lower_edge of the motorcycle_helmet
J & M claims that these accessories infringe its ¡¬525_patent

J & M brought suit against Harley-Davidson in November 1997 alleging infringement of claims 3-BIG_TOKEN__7_and_15__BIG_TOKEN -17 of the ¡¬525_patent2 Harley-Davidson responded that its microphone is non-infringing and that J & M 's patent is invalid on numerous grounds
J & M then moved to preliminarily enjoin Harley-Davidson from selling its allegedly infringing accessories

The district_court denied J & M 's motion finding that J & M had failed to establish a substantial likelihood of success on the merits for its allegations of infringement
J & M_Corp. v. Harley-Davidson Inc. No
CIV 97-2353-PHX-RCB ( D.Ariz
May_14,_1998 ) ( `` J & M_I `` )
In reaching this conclusion the court construed the claims in dispute and determined that all of the claims require accessories having a separate mount for the microphone and for the electrical_plug each mount having its own clamp
Because the accused devices have an integrated mount attached by a single_clamp the court found that they could not literally infringe
J & M_I at 8-15
The court then considered infringement by equivalents and concluded that J & M had not carried its burden of demonstrating infringement
Id.at 15-19

J & M appealed the district_court 's denial of its motion and we summarily affirmed with no written opinion
J & M_Corp. v. Harley-Davidson Inc. 185_F.3d_885_(Fed.Cir.1999) ( unpublished table decision )

The case returned to the district_court and J & M moved for partial summary_judgment on Harley-Davidson 's several affirmative *1365 defenses
Harley-Davidson responded with its own motion for summary_judgment of non-infringement
In addressing these motions the court focused on J & M 's arguments for infringement by equivalents having disposed of J & M 's other infringement arguments with its claim construction rulings
These arguments for infringement by equivalents included assertions of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents with respect to all claims
These arguments further included assertions of literal infringement of claims 15-17 contending that the means-plus-function limitations in those claims are statutorily entitled to a literal scope that includes `` the corresponding structure.. described in the [ written description ] and equivalents thereof ''
35 U.S.C.¡± 112 ?
6
The court had previously concluded that the `` gripping means '' limitation of claims 15-17 corresponds to the disclosed separate_clamps for the microphone_mount and the plug_mount
See J & M_I at 13-14
J & M argued however that an integrated mount attached by a clamp is an equivalent of the separate_clamps disclosed in the specification and that the `` gripping means '' limitation of claims 15-17 should be construed under 35 U.S.C.¡± 112 ?
6 to read literally on the integrated mount of the defendants ' accessories
Because it considered the analysis of infringement by ¡± 112 ?
6 equivalents of claims 15-17 and infringement under the doctrine of equivalents of claims 3-7 to be substantially the same the court considered these issues together

In doing so the court first rejected the defendants ' counter-arguments that the prosecution history limited the scope of equivalents either as a matter of claim construction or by prosecution_history_estoppel
The court next determined that the evidence for infringement by equivalents introduced by J & M including all three of its expert_reports was either inadmissible or defective

The court then applied the function-way-result test for equivalency
The court reasoned that the function of the two clamps in all of the claims at issue was to attach the accessories to the helmet without damaging the helmet and in a way that reduced the bulkiness of the accessory
Id.at 52
Separately clamping the microphone and plug_mounts reduced the bulkiness of the mounts
The court concluded that the single_clamp design did not reduce the bulkiness of the accessory in the same way to produce the same result and that no reasonable juror could hold otherwise
Id.at 53-54

As a result the court granted summary_judgment of non-infringement
J & M now appeals from this grant of summary_judgment arguing that the court abused its discretion in excluding J & M 's expert_reports and that the court erred in holding that the accused accessories do not infringe by equivalents
Harley-Davidson_cross-appeals the court 's holding that J & M is not barred from asserting infringement under the doctrine of equivalents by prosecution_history_estoppel
