BACKGROUND
Western_Union owns the ¡¬203 ¡¬747 ¡¬309 and ¡¬094_patent s directed to a system for performing money_transfers
The ¡¬203 ¡¬747 and ¡¬309_patent s ( collectively the `` send patents '' ) specifically relate to methods of sending money through a financial_services_institution ( `` FSI '' )
The ¡¬094_patent claims methods for receiving transferred money
The patented_system relates to money_transfer services such as those offered by Western_Union through retail_locations where a customer may identify a recipient and tender an amount to be delivered to the recipient
The money_transfer service collects the amount from the retail_location and completes the transaction for the customer
Some of the traditional money_transfer systems required money senders to fill out forms with transaction information such as recipient information and the amount of money to be transferred
The ¡¬203_patent claims a method of performing a formless money_transfer using an electronic_transaction_fulfillment_device ( `` ETFD '' )
Figure 1 from the ¡¬203_patent depicts an embodiment of the patented_system

*1363. ?
Figure 1 of the ¡¬203_patent
In the patented_system a customer has telephone access to the customer service representative ( `` CSR '' ) at the financial institution who obtains details of the transfer and `` stages '' the money_transfer for the customer storing the transaction_details on a host computer ( 18 )
The customer is later able to complete the transaction at a retail_location where an agent is able to retrieve the transaction from the computer ( 18 ) through an ETFD ( 22 ) and accept the required amount of money from the customer
Claim 1 is representative of the patented_invention : 1
A method of performing a money_transfer send_transaction the method_comprising : providing a sender direct access to an employee of a financial_services_institution in order to receive transaction_details from the sender ; storing on a data_base the transaction_details provided by the sender wherein the transaction_details include a desired amount of money to be sent by the sender to a recipient ; establishing a code that corresponds to the transaction_details stored on the data_base wherein the code is established for use by the sender during the send_transaction ; storing the code on the data_base such that the code is useable to identify the send_transaction on the data_base ; entering the code into an electronic_transaction_fulfillment_device in communication with the data_base to retrieve the transaction_details from the *1364 data_base after the step of storing the code on the data_base ; and
determining a collect_amount to be collected from the sender based on the transaction_details ; wherein the code is not provided by or to the recipient for use by the recipient during the send_transaction
¡¬203_patent claim 1 ( emphases added )

Claim 12 is dependent on claim 1 and adds the limitation that an employee of the money_transfer business provides the transaction identifying code
Claim 16 which is also dependent on claim 1 adds the limitation of collecting the money from the sender notifying the database of the collection and recording the transaction as complete
The ¡¬203_patent was filed on October 26 1999 and issued on December 3 2002
The ¡¬747_patent also filed in 1999 and the ¡¬309_patent filed in 2004 are both continuations of the ¡¬203_patent
The ¡¬309_patent claims are similar and substantially identical in scope to the ¡¬203_patent claims
The ¡¬747_patent primarily adds the use of internet-based communications using an internet communications protocol ( `` the TCP/IP protocol '' ) to the money_transfer system and claims the use of a `` first_computer '' instead of `` the data_base '' used in the ¡¬203_patent
Claim 20 is illustrative : 20
A method of performing a money_transfer send_transaction through a financial_services_institution the method_comprising : receiving transaction_details on a first_computer of the financial_services_institution wherein the transaction_details are provided by a sender and include a desired amount of money to be sent by the sender to a recipient ; storing the transaction_details on the first_computer ; establishing a code that corresponds to the transaction_details wherein the code is established for use by the sender during the send_transaction ; storing the code on the first_computer such that the code is useable to identify the send_transaction ; receiving the code at the first_computer from an electronic_transaction_fulfillment_device in communication with the first_computer after the step of storing the code on the first_computer ; validating the code received from the transaction_fulfillment_device by comparing the code received from the transaction_fulfillment_device with the code stored on the first_computer ; and
transmitting a collect_amount to be collected from the sender from the first_computer to the transaction_fulfillment_device if the code received from the transaction_fulfillment_device is valid ; wherein at least a portion of the method is performed using TCP/IP and wherein the code is not provided by or to the recipient for use by the recipient during the send_transaction
¡¬747_patent claim 20 ( emphases added )
During prosecution of the ¡¬747 and ¡¬309_patent s the inventors filed a terminal disclaimer limiting the terms of those patents to that of the ¡¬203_patent in response to double patenting rejections by the USPTO

Like the patented_invention a prior art system owned by Orlandi_Valuta another money_transfer service company also employed technology that did not require customers to fill out forms to transfer money
