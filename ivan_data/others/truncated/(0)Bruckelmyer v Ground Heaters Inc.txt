Synopsis
Background: Patentee appealed from decision of the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, Donovan W. Frank, J., 2005 WL 1155938, granting summary judgment of invalidity of two patents in favor of competitors.
 
The Court of Appeals, Lourie, Circuit Judge held that Canadian patent application, including two figures associated with it, was "publicly accessible," and thus was a "printed publication" under statute establishing conditions for patentability.
 
Affirmed.
 
Linn, Circuit Judge, filed dissenting opinion.
