Synopsis
Background: Owner of patent for diabetes drug brought infringement actions against proposed manufacturers of generic versions. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Denise Cote, J., 417 F.Supp.2d 341, granted judgment for owner. Manufacturers appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Lourie, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
person of ordinary skill in the art would not have selected closest prior art compound as lead compound for antidiabetic treatment;
 
person of ordinary skill in the art would not have been prompted to modify closest prior art compound, using steps of homologation or ring-walking, to synthesize claimed compound; and
 
any error was harmless that district court may have committed by incorrectly implying that prosecution histories were not accessible to public.
 
Affirmed.
 
Dyk, Circuit Judge, filed concurring opinion.
