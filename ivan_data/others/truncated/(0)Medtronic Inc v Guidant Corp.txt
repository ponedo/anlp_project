Rehearing En Banc Denied Dec. 21, 2006.*
Synopsis
Background: Competitor brought declaratory judgment action against patentee manufacturer of medical devices, assignee, and exclusive licensee alleging that claims in pacemaker patent were invalid by reason of violation of rule against recapturing surrendered subject matter. The United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Sue L. Robinson, Chief Judge, 378 F.Supp.2d 503, determined that patent was not invalid. Competitor appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Schall, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
independent claims of application as filed, and claims that depended from them, did not disclose unconditional embodiment;
 
other claims included unconditional embodiment;
 
unconditional embodiment was not surrendered;
 
unconditional embodiment had not been surrendered through arguments made during prosecution;
 
claim did not include embodiment with only one sensing electrode;
 
attorney's statements about prior art patent's single ventricular sensing electrode were not unmistakable assertion in support of patentability that invalidated reissue patent claims covering embodiment with only one sensing electrode;
 
attorney did not clearly and unmistakably surrender unconditional embodiment during prosecution of patent by distinguishing prior art patent on basis that it had electrodes in the ventricles that paced but did not sense; and
 
attorney did not clearly and unmistakably surrender unconditional embodiment during prosecution of patent by distinguishing prior art patent on basis that it could not selectively analyze.
 
Affirmed.
 
Dyk, Circuit Judge, filed opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.
