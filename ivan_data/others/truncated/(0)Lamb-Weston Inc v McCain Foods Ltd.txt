78 F.3d 540
United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
LAMB-WESTON, INC., Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
McCAIN FOODS, LTD. and McCain Foods, Inc., Defendants-Appellees.
Nos. 93-1536, 94-1225.
|
Feb. 29, 1996.
Synopsis
Food processor brought action against competitor for patent infringement, trademark infringement, unfair competition, and trademark dilution with respect to its lattice-shape, waffle-cut partially fried potato product. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Washington, Alan A. McDonald, J., ruled that plaintiff's patent was invalid and unenforceable, 818 F.Supp. 1376, and appeal was taken. The Court of Appeals held that: (1) patent for process of making frozen, partially fried lattice-shaped french fries called "waffle fries" was invalid as obvious, and (2) determination that patent was invalid as obvious made it unnecessary to determine whether patent was unenforceable because of inequitable conduct.
 
Affirmed and vacated.
 
Pauline Newman, Circuit Judge, filed dissenting opinion.
