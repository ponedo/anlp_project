United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
SPECTRUM INTERNATIONAL, INC., Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
STERILITE CORPORATION, Defendant-Appellee.
No. 98-1243.
|
Dec. 9, 1998.
Synopsis
Patentee brought action against competitor, alleging infringement of patent for stackable crates. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Whitman K. Knapp, J., entered summary judgment of noninfringement, and patentee appealed. The Court of Appeals, Clevenger, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) patent did not cover crate in which the bottom side merged with both the bottom edge and top edge of the central portion of the front wall; (2) patent was not infringed literally or under doctrine of equivalents; and (3) any error committed by district court in examining patentee's commercial embodiment was harmless.
 
Affirmed.
