Synopsis
Patent assignee brought infringement action against competitor relating to patent directed toward cost effective method of producing, in low volume, multicolor faces for watches, clocks, thermometers, and other instruments. The United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Joseph P. Kinneary, J., concluded that patent was invalid as inherently anticipated. Assignee appealed. The Court of Appeals, Rader, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) patent was not invalid as inherently anticipated, and (2) term "creating" required substantive addition or modification of artwork in computer such as when graphics software added design to instrument face.
 
Vacated and remanded.
