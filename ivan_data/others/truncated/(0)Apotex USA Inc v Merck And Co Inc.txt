Synopsis
Patentee brought action against competitor, alleging competitor infringed patents on process for making solid formulation of enalapril sodium for use in treatment of high blood pressure. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, 2000 WL 97582, Matthew F. Kennelly, J., granted competitor's motion for summary judgment on grounds patents were invalid, and patentee appealed. The Court of Appeals, Lourie, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) statute under which patent was invalid if invention was previously made "in this country by another inventor who had not abandoned, suppressed, or concealed it" did not limit proof negating suppression or concealment to activities occurring within the United States; (2) competitor, in asserting invalidity of patent on ground of prior invention, had to rebut any alleged suppression or concealment with clear and convincing evidence to the contrary; (3) patentee successfully discharged its burden of going forward with evidence creating a genuine issue of material fact of suppression or concealment; but (4) competitor, the first inventor of the process for manufacturing its own patented product, succeeded in rebutting by clear and convincing evidence inference of suppression or concealment created by its five-year period of inactivity in disclosing invention, and thus established invalidity of patents at issue based on its prior invention.
 
Affirmed.
 
Opinion, 2001 WL 630026, superseded.
