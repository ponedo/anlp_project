As Amended on Grant of Rehearing May 1, 1997.
Synopsis
Patent assignee brought action for infringement of patent on drying machine used in making paper. Competitor counterclaimed for infringement of two of competitor's patents. The United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin, Barbara B. Crabb, J., 895 F.Supp. 1158, granted summary judgment that assignee's patent was not infringed, and that it did not anticipate competitor's two patents, and, following jury trial, entered judgment that competitor's patents were valid and infringed. Assignee appealed. The Court of Appeals, Rich, Circuit Judge, held that competitor's patents were invalid for obviousness.
 
Reversed.
