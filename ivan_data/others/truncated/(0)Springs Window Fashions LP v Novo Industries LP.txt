Synopsis
Patent holder brought infringement action against competitor relating to method of trimming window blinds. Competitor made counterclaims of tortious interference and disparagement. The United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin, John C. Shabaz, J., granted summary judgment of noninfringement and dismissed counterclaims, 249 F.Supp.2d 1111. Both parties appealed. The Court of Appeals, Bryson, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) patent holder was held to restrictive claim construction that was argued during prosecution; (2) disputed claims excluded disclaimed single plate device; (3) trial court did not abuse its discretion in its denial of competitor's request for discovery continuance; (4) competitor failed to provide affirmative evidence of bad faith by patent holder; and (5) competitor did not provide any evidence that patent holder engaged in inequitable conduct sufficient to make patent unenforceable.
 
Affirmed.
