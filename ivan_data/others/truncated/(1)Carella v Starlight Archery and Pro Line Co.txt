As Modified Dec. 12, 1986.
Synopsis
Appeal was taken from order of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, James Harvey, J., 595 F.Supp. 613, holding that patent for archery bow sight assembly was infringed and not invalid. The Court of Appeals, Archer, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) patent was not anticipated by another patent; (2) invention set forth in claim for patent of sight assembly was not obvious in view of prior art; (3) applicant's failure to disclose to Patent and Trademark Office settlement of prior declaratory judgment action did not render patent unenforceable; and (4) evidence supported award of damages for lost profits.
 
Affirmed.
