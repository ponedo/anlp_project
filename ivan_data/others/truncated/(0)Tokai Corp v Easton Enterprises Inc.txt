Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc Denied April 1, 2011.
Synopsis
Background: Patentees holding three patents related to extended-rod safety utility lighters with automatic locking features brought infringement action against competitors. Competitors counterclaimed for invalidity. The United States District Court for the Central District of California, Virginia A. Phillips, J., 2009 WL 1582924, construed patent claims and thereafter, 2009 WL 2047845,granted motion to strike supplemental invalidity contentions, and granted summary judgment of invalidity for obviousness. Parties cross-appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Lourie, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to exempt patentees' expert from discovery rule's written report requirement;
 
patentees' failure to adhere to discovery rule's written report requirement for experts was not harmless or substantially justified, warranting exclusion of experts' declarations;
 
competitors did not have enhanced burden of overcoming statutory presumption that patents were valid in seeking summary judgment of invalidity; and
 
asserted patent claims were obvious, rendering them invalid.
 
Affirmed.
 
Newman, Circuit Judge, filed a dissenting opinion.
