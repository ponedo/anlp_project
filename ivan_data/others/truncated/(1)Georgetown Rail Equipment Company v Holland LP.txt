|
Decided: August 1, 2017
Synopsis
Background: Owner of patent related to a system and method for inspecting railroad tracks with the use of digital technology brought infringement action. Following claim construction, 2014 WL 11498109, and jury trial, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, No. 6:13-cv-00366-RWS, Robert Schroeder III, J., entered finding of infringement, and 2016 WL 3346084, denied competitor's renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law (JMOL) of noninfringement and awarded enhanced damages based on finding of willful infringement. Competitor appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Wallach, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
competitor infringed patent;
 
substantial evidence supported award of lost profits;
 
substantial evidence supported finding that subjective recklessness led to willful infringement of patent; and
 
it was within district court's discretion to award enhanced damages.
 
Affirmed.
