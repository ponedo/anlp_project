Synopsis
Patent licensee for connectors of duct work segments brought declaratory judgment action which challenged validity of patent. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, Clyde S. Cahill, J., held that patent was invalid and that inventor engaged in inequitable conduct. Inventors appealed. The Court of Appeals, Pauline Newman, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) patent was not invalid for failure to disclose best mode; (2) invention was enabled by description in specification; and (3) no inequitable conduct occurred.
 
Reversed.
