Synopsis
Background: Former distributor of manufacturer's screw anchor products brought action against manufacturer for, inter alia, declaration of patent invalidity. Manufacturer counterclaimed for infringement. On remand, 234 F.3d 654, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, Catherine D. Perry, J., found that the patents were invalid as obvious, and the manufacturer appealed.
 
The Court of Appeals, Rader, Circuit Judge, held that finding of obviousness was not clearly erroneous.
 
Affirmed.
