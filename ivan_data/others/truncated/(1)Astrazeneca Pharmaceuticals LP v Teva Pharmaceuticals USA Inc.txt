Synopsis
Background: Patent owner brought action against competitor alleging infringement of patent covering antipsychotic drug quetiapine. The United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, Joel A. Pisano, J., 567 F.Supp.2d 683, granted owner's motion for summary judgment of no inequitable conduct in prosecution of patent application, and competitor appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Newman, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
owner's provision of its existing test data for certain prior art compound was not material misrepresentation or omission;
 
owner did not make implied misrepresentation that no prior art compound was atypical; and
 
withholding of information regarding certain atypical compounds did not, without more, demonstrate intent to deceive.
 
Affirmed.
