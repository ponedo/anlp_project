11 F.3d 1036
United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
The RAWLPLUG COMPANY, INC., Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS, INC., Defendant-Appellee.
No. 92-1356.
|
Nov. 23, 1993.
Synopsis
Patentee filed action for infringement of its patents for a device used to anchor fixtures fastened to masonry. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Charles M. Metzner, J., entered judgment for alleged infringer. Patentee appealed. The Court of Appeals, Plunkett, District Judge, sitting by designation, held that the district court committed reversible error in comparing the shape of the devices before installation, where the claims of the patents clearly referred to the shape after installation, and in reading additional restrictions into the claim reference to a nonabrading shank and, thus, in finding no infringement.
 
Reversed and remanded for further proceedings.
