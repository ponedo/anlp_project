Synopsis
Background: Holders of patent for anti-cholesterol drug brought action alleging infringement after generic producers initiated challenge to patent by filing an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) accompanied by Paragraph IV certification. The United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Joseph J. Farnan, Jr., J., 719 F.Supp.2d 388, held that patent was valid, enforceable, and infringed. Competitors appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Newman, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
patent was not invalid on ground of obviousness;
 
on claim of inequitable conduct, reference compounds that were sufficiently similar in structure to warrant citation were material to prosecution of application for patent;
 
finding by district court, that deceptive intent was not shown, and was not the single most reasonable inference, was not clearly erroneous;
 
unintentional failure to file Information Disclosure Statement (IDS) citing material prior art references, and omission of specific claim to preferred species, did not warrant denial of reissue application; and
 
agent and subsidiary could be held liable for patent infringement as "submitter" of ANDA.
 
Affirmed.
 
Plager, Circuit Judge, filed concurring opinion.
 
Mayer, Circuit Judge, filed dissenting opinion.
