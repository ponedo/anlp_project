Synopsis
Patentee brought action against competitor, alleging infringement of patent claiming a "1-Click(r)" method and system for placing a purchase order over the Internet. Patentee's motion for preliminary injunction was granted by the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, Marsha J. Pechman, J., 73 F.Supp.2d 1228, and competitor appealed. The Court of Appeals, Clevenger, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) patentee demonstrated likely literal infringement of at least the four independent claims of the patent, but (2) competitor mounted a serious challenge, based on obviousness in light of on prior art, to the validity of the patent, precluding preliminary injunction.
