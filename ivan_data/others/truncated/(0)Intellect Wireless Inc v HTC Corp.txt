732 F.3d 1339
United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
INTELLECT WIRELESS, INC., Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
HTC CORPORATION and HTC America, Inc., Defendants-Appellees.
No. 2012-1658.
|
Oct. 9, 2013.
Synopsis
Background: Patentee brought action against competitors, alleging infringement of patents relating to the wireless transmission of caller identification (ID) information. After a bench trial, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, William T. Hart, J., 910 F.Supp.2d 1056, found the patents unenforceable due to inequitable conduct. Patentee appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Moore, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
falsehoods in inventor's original declaration supported a finding of materiality on inequitable conduct claim, and
 
district court did not clearly err in concluding inventor's conduct satisfied the intent element of inequitable conduct claim.
 
Affirmed.
