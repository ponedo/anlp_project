Federal Circuit.
TRIMED, INCORPORATED, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
STRYKER CORPORATION, Defendant-Appellee.
No. 2009-1423.

June 9, 2010.
Synopsis
Background: Patentee brought infringement action against competitor, alleging infringement of patent relating to an implantable pin plate used to set bone fractures. The United States District Court for the Central District of California, Manuel L. Real, J., granted competitor's motion for summary judgment of noninfringement. Patentee appealed. The Court of Appeals, 514 F.3d 1256,reversed and remanded. On remand, the United States District Court for the Central District of California, Manuel L. Real, J., granted competitor's motion for summary judgment of invalidity. Patentee again appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Linn, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
fact issues as to whether patent was invalid as obvious precluded summary judgment;
 
district court failed to explain its invocation of commonsense in finding patent invalid on obviousness grounds;
 
district court was required to consider evidence regarding secondary considerations of nonobviousness before determining that patent was invalid as obvious;
 
fact issues as to whether patent was invalid on anticipation grounds precluded summary judgment; and
 
reassignment on remand was warranted to preserve appearance of justice.
 
Reversed and remanded.
