Synopsis
Background: Assignee of patents directed at drug used to treat patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis and related entities brought actions against generic drug manufacturers, asserting patent infringement claims. Following claim construction order, 2016 WL 873062, and following consolidated bench trial, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware in Nos. 1:14-cv-01171-GMS, 1:14-cv-01172-GMS, 1:14-cv-01278-GMS, 1:14-cv-01419-GMS, 1:15-cv-00124-GMS, and 1:15-cv-00306-GMS, Gregory M. Sleet, J., 2017 WL 401943, found that asserted claims of patents were invalid as obvious. Assignee appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Reyna, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
"sufficiency" terms in patents were non-limiting;
 
district court's conclusion that dosing regimen disclosed in patent was obvious was not clearly erroneous;
 
district court's conclusion that limitations in patent regarding "improved tolerability" were obvious was not clearly erroneous; and
 
district court's conclusion that limitation in patent regarding "reduced severity" was obvious was not clearly erroneous.
 
Affirmed.
 
Procedural Posture(s): On Appeal; Judgment.
*1015 Appeal from the United States District Court for the District of Delaware in Nos. 1:14-cv-01171-GMS, 1:14-cv-01172-GMS, 1:14-cv-01278-GMS, 1:14-cv-01419-GMS, 1:15-cv-00124-GMS, 1:15-cv-00306-GMS, Judge Gregory M. Sleet.
