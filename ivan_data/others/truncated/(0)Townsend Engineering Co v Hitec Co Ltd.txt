Federal Circuit.
TOWNSEND ENGINEERING COMPANY, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
HITEC CO., LTD., Defendant-Appellee.
No. 87-1141.
|
Sept. 16, 1987.
Synopsis
Action was brought for patent infringement. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Milton I. Shadur, J., found no infringement and appeal was taken. The Court of Appeals, Friedman, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) accused's sausage-stuffing machine did not literally infringe patent, and (2) prosecution history estoppel precluded patentee from relying on doctrine of equivalents.
 
Affirmed.
