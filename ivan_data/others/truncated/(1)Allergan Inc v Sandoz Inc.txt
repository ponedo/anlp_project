Synopsis
Background: Holder of patent for topical solutions used for treating glaucoma, and methods of applying them, brought action against competitors, alleging patent infringement. Following bench trial, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Michael H. Schneider, J., 2013 WL 1314188, entered judgment of infringement and no invalidity. Competitors appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Lourie, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
prior art taught away from claimed inventions;
 
claimed inventions exhibited unexpected results which differed in kind from prior art;
 
specifications for company's asserted patents provided adequate written descriptions;
 
asserted patents satisfied enablement requirement; and
 
competitor's proposed product literally infringed patents.
 
Affirmed.
