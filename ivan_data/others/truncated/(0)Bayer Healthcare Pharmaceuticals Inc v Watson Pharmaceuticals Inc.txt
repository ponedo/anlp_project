Synopsis
Background: Patentee brought action against competitors, alleging infringement of a patent related to a low-dose, extended-regimen combined oral contraceptive. Competitors filed a counterclaim alleging invalidity. The United States District Court for the District of Nevada, Kent J. Dawson, J., entered summary judgment for patentee on competitors' counterclaim, and competitors appealed.
 
The Court of Appeals, Lourie, Circuit Judge, held that patent was invalid for obviousness.
 
Reversed and remanded.
