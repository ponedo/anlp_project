Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc Denied Aug. 24, 2000.
Synopsis
Company that developed and promoted polymer-free liquid crystal displays (LCDs) brought action seeking declaratory judgment that patent was invalid. Patent assignee and licensees brought infringement action against company, and cases were consolidated. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Jeffrey A. Kaplan, J., entered judgment upon jury's finding that patent was invalid for anticipation and obviousness and was not infringed. After denial of their motion for new trial, assignee and licensees appealed. The Court of Appeals, Gajarsa, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) whether and to what extent material has been incorporated by reference into an allegedly anticipating reference is a question of law; (2) instruction directing jury to determine whether and to what extent material was incorporated by reference was erroneous and prejudicial; (3) newly discovered evidence warranted new trial on issue of obviousness; (4) newly discovered evidence warranted new trial on issue of infringement; and (5) bad faith conduct of company's counsel warranted sanction of new trial.
 
Reversed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.
