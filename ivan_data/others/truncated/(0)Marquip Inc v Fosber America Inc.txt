Synopsis
Patentee brought action alleging infringement of patent that claimed improvements for handling and stacking of corrugated paperboard sheets. The United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin, John C. Shabaz, Chief Judge, granted summary judgment for alleged infringer and, 30 F.Supp.2d 1142,denied patentee's motion for relief from judgment. Patentee appealed both orders, and appeals were consolidated. The Court of Appeals, Rader, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) patent was not infringed under doctrine of equivalents, and (2) patentee was not entitled to relief from judgment based on newly discovered evidence.
 
Affirmed.
