Decided: June 5, 2017
Synopsis
Background: Patentee brought action alleging that competitor's home security systems infringed its patent directed to system and method for creating personalized consumer product. After patentee's motion to voluntarily dismiss the action was granted, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Roy S. Payne, United States Magistrate Judge, 2016 WL 3883549, denied competitor's motion for attorney fees. Competitor appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Wallach, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
District Court failed to consider patentee's willful ignorance of prior art;
 
District Court misjudged patentee's conduct in other litigation; and
 
District Court improperly conflated Rule 11 with statute providing for award of attorney fees to prevailing party in exceptional patent cases.
 
Reversed and remanded.
 
Mayer, Circuit Judge, filed concurring opinion.
