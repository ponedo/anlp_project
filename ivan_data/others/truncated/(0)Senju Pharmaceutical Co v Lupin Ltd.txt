United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
SENJU PHARMACEUTICAL CO., Ltd., Kyorin Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Allergan, Inc., Plaintiffs-Appellants
v.

Synopsis
Background: Patentees brought action against competitor, alleging infringement of a patent for an aqueous liquid pharmaceutical composition comprising gatifloxacin for topical ophthalmic administration. The United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Sue L. Robinson, J., 836 F.Supp.2d 196, adjudged the claims infringed but invalid for obviousness. Patentees appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Plager, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
District Court properly considered evidence of unexpected results and did not err in finding that, based on record and testimony offered, increase in corneal permeability shown by patentees was not unexpected or surprising, but was a product of routine optimization that would have been obvious to one of skill in the art, and
 
District Court properly applied presumption of validity, considering both evidence of obviousness and evidence of unexpected results, to find that defendants set forth clear and convincing evidence that patent was invalid for obviousness.
 
Affirmed.
 
Newman, Circuit Judge, filed separate dissenting opinion.
