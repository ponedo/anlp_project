Synopsis
Patent holder brought action against licensee alleging infringement and breach of licensing agreement. The United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Vaughn R. Walker, J., granted judgment for licensee. Patent holder appealed. The Court of Appeals, Bryson, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) fact issue existed as to whether particular experiment was material; (2) district court committed clear error by finding clear and convincing evidence of intent to deceive in inventors' failure to disclose particular experiment to patent examiner; (3) inventors failure to disclose purification and sizing experiments of Thermus aquaticus (Taq) bacterium was not material omission; (4) district court's finding was clearly erroneous, that inventors' knowledge of hydrophobicity of Taq bacterium was material to determining whether prior art sizing experiment was accurate; (5) fact issue existed as to whether alleged misrepresentation or omission, associated with internal memorandum of employee, was material to issue associated with respective molecular weights of prior art and purified thermostable enzyme claimed in patent; and (6) district court's finding, that inventors committed inequitable conduct by erroneously stating that they performed particular purification protocol and had obtained certain results, was supported by evidence and could not be deemed clearly erroneous.
 
Vacated and remanded.
 
Pauline Newman, Circuit Judge, filed a dissenting opinion.
