Rehearing Denied March 10, 2004.
Synopsis
Background: Owner of patent directed to method and apparatus for handling waste water slurries in storage tanks sued competitor for infringement. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, 2002 WL 1769979, Suzanne B. Conlon, J., granted summary judgment of non-infringement, and appeal was taken.
 
The Court of Appeals, Gajarsa, Circuit Judge, held that claim requirement, that liquid had to follow "substantial helical flow path," meant that flow pattern had to be generally, though not necessarily perfectly, spiral, and that it had to fill much, though not necessarily all, of tank's volume.
 
Vacated and remanded.
 
Lourie, Circuit Judge, dissented and filed opinion.
