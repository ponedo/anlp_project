537 F.3d 1342
United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
DSW, INC. and DSW Shoe Warehouse, Inc., Plaintiffs-Appellants,
v.
SHOE PAVILION, INC., Defendant-Appellee.
No. 2008-1085.
|
Aug. 19, 2008.
Synopsis
Background: Patent owner filed action against competitor alleging infringement of patent that taught system and method for storing and displaying large stock of footwear for customer self-service. The United States District Court for the Central District of California, Florence-Marie Cooper, J., granted judgment for competitor. Owner appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Mayer, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
trial court could not import limitations from apparatus and system claims into method claims;
 
phrase, "horizontally movably positionable stack divider," meant that vertically disposed stack dividers had to be capable of being moved into different horizontal positions in footwear display;
 
word, "also," from patent examiner's statement, that "prior art also does not teach a method of displaying 1st and 2nd footwear styles," did not imply that latter-discussed method claims depended on previously-discussed apparatus claims;
 
display method had not been constrained by track and roller limitation;
 
preferred embodiment that included rolling track mechanism did not constrain display method; and
 
reasonable steps and good faith efforts by competitor to bring its infringing activity to timely end did not eliminate competitor's liability for damages to owner for infringement that occurred subsequent to receipt of actual notice of patent.
 
Vacated and remanded.
