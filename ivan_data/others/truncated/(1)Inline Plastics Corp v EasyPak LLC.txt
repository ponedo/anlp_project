Following claim construction, 2013 WL 2395998, patent owner moved for entry of final judgment of non-infringement of first patent, on premise that claims as construed were not infringed. The United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, Timothy S. Hillman, J., 2014 WL 297224, entered final judgment of non-infringement of first patent, dismissed without prejudice competitor's declaratory judgment counterclaims for invalidity, and dismissed patent owner's count for infringement of second patent with prejudice. Patent owner appealed.
 
The Court of Appeals, Newman, Circuit Judge, held that term "frangible section" meant a section of material that includes at least one score line or at least one perforation line.
 
Vacated and remanded.
