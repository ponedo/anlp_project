Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc Denied Feb. 23, 2009.*
Synopsis
Background: Patent owner brought action against competitor alleging infringement of its patents relating to extended release formulations of clarithromycin. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, David H. Coar, J., 500 F.Supp.2d 807, granted owner's motion for preliminary injunction, and denied competitor's motion for stay of injunction pending appeal, 500 F.Supp.2d 846. Competitor appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Newman, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
finding of inequitable conduct was not appropriate;
 
patent owner had substantial likelihood of success on merits of claim that its patents were not likely to be held unenforceable based on inequitable conduct;
 
owner had substantial likelihood of success on merits of claim that its patents were infringed;
 
owner would likely suffer irreparable harm by market share and revenue loss upon competitor's entry into the market in absence of preliminary injunction;
 
balance of hardships favored preliminary injunction; and
 
public interest supported grant of preliminary injunction.
 
Affirmed.
 
Gajarsa, Circuit Judge, filed dissenting opinion.
