United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
SOVERAIN SOFTWARE LLC, Plaintiff-Appellee
v.
VICTORIA'S SECRET DIRECT BRAND MANAGEMENT, LLC, Avon Products, Inc., Defendants-Appellants.
Nos. 2012-1649, 2012-1650.

Feb. 12, 2015.
Synopsis
Background: Patentee brought action alleging infringement of patents directed to virtual shopping carts and use of hypertext statement to permit users to access information about past orders. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Leonard Davis, Chief Judge, construed patents, 2011 WL 111869, and, after entry of jury verdict in patentee's favor, denied defendants' motion for judgment as matter of law, 899 F.Supp.2d 574. Defendants appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Dyk, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
patentee had full and fair opportunity to litigate patents' non-obviousness in prior infringement litigation, and
 
prior judgment invalidating independent claim as obvious collaterally estopped patentee from asserting validity of dependent claim in subsequent action.
 
Reversed.
