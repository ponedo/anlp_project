Synopsis
Patentee and its exclusive licensee brought action against competitor alleging infringement of patents relating to a lung surfactant composition for treating respiratory distress syndrome in premature babies. Competitor counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment of noninfringement and invalidity. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Matthew F. Kennelly, J., 2001 WL 558142,granted summary judgment of noninfringement, and plaintiffs appealed. The Court of Appeals, Prost, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) statements made during prosecution of earlier-filed patent did not create estoppel as to scope of claims of later-filed patent; (2) hypothetical patent claims that would cover the accused composition would not have been anticipated or obvious based on the prior art; (3) expert testimony did not effectively negate claim limitation as to phospholipid content; and (4) patent's recitation of specific numeric ranges for chemical components did not preclude assertion of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents.
 
Vacated and remanded.
