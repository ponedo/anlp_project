Synopsis
Patentee brought action for infringement of patents relating to transmission and use of digital information. The United States District Court for the Central District of California, Edward Rafeedie, J., entered judgment upon jury verdict finding both patents invalid, but that one patent was infringed if valid. Patentee appealed, and alleged infringer filed conditional cross-appeal. The Court of Appeals, Pauline Newman, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) patentee failed to preserve objection to verdict form; (2) first patent was invalid due to prior public use; and (3) second patent was invalid as obvious.
 
Affirmed.
