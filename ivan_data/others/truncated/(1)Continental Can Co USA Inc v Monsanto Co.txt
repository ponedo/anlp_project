Synopsis
Holder of patent for plastic bottle with ribbed bottom structure brought infringement action against competitor. The United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, S. Arthur Spiegel, J., entered partial summary judgment in favor of competitor, ruling that patent was invalid, and patentee appealed. The Court of Appeals, Pauline Newman, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) fact issue as to whether patent was anticipated by another patent precluded summary judgment, and (2) fact issue as to whether patent was obvious in light of prior art references precluded summary judgment.
 
Reversed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.
