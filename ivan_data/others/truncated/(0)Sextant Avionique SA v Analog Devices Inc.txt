United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
SEXTANT AVIONIQUE, S.A., Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
ANALOG DEVICES, INC., Defendant-Cross-Appellant.
Nos. 98-1063, 98-1077.

Feb. 26, 1999.
Synopsis
Patentee brought action against competitor alleging infringement of patents for accelerometers. The United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Susan Illston, J., granted summary judgment for competitor on claim of literal infringement and granted judgment as a matter of law on claim of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents. Patentee appealed. The Court of Appeals, Lourie, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) term "metallization" in patents referred to a deposited metallic material and patents were thus not literally infringed by device that used doped silicon materials; (2) patentee was barred by prosecution history estoppel from asserting, as to first patent, that use of doped silicon on capacitor plates was equivalent to patentee's "metallization" limitation; (3) as to second patent, amendment of claim to include "metallization" limitation was presumptively related to patentability, such that prosecution history estoppel was applicable; and (4) presumption that amendment was related to patentability precluded any claim that accused device had element equivalent to "metallization" limitation.
 
Affirmed.
 
Smith, Senior Circuit Judge, dissented in part and filed opinion.
