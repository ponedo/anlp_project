Synopsis
Assignee of patents for shift cable components used in motor vehicles brought infringement action against competitor. Competitor counterclaimed for declaratory judgment of noninfringement and invalidity. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, John Corbett O'Meara, J., entered judgment upon jury verdict in favor of assignee and denied competitor's motions for judgment as a matter of law. Competitor appealed. The Court of Appeals, Linn, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) term "clip" in patent claim should not be construed as limited to embodiment described in specification; (2) district court's claim construction was harmless error; (3) patent for "Serviceable Clip Core Coupling" was literally infringed; (4) patent satisfied best mode requirement; (5) patent was not invalid as obvious; and (6) second patent was neither anticipated nor obvious.
 
Affirmed.
