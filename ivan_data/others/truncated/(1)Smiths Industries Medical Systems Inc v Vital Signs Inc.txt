183 F.3d 1347
United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
SMITHS INDUSTRIES MEDICAL SYSTEMS, INC., as successor of Intertech Resources Inc., Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
VITAL SIGNS, INC., Defendant-Appellee.
No. 98-1106.
|
July 14, 1999.
Synopsis
Patentee sued competitor for infringement of patent for manual resuscitator device. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Harry D. Leinenweber, J., entered judgment for competitor, finding that all claims of patent were invalid, and that certain claims were not infringed by two of competitor's products. Patentee appealed, and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, Clevenger, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) "resuscitator" in patent meant a resuscitator that normally allows a patient to spontaneously breathe gas that is stored in the squeezebag, but automatically directs the patient to breathe ambient air through an unobstructed exit port if the gas supply to the squeezebag becomes occluded; (2) patent was not invalid as obvious; and (3) court's improper claim construction required remand for new determination regarding infringement.
 
Reversed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.
 
Lourie, Circuit Judge, dissented in part and filed opinion.
