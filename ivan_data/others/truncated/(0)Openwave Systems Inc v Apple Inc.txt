No. 2015-1108.

Dec. 15, 2015.
Synopsis
Background: Assignee of patents, setting forth method and architecture for an interactive two-way data communication network, brought infringement action. The United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Richard G. Andrews, J., 2014 WL 651911, construed disputed claim term and entered stipulated judgment of non-infringement. Assignee appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, O'Malley, Circuit Judge, held that
 
patentee disavowed mobile devices containing computer modules from patents through repeated disparagement in patent specification, and
 
term "mobile device" in patents meant portable wireless two-way communication device that did not contain a computer module.
 
Affirmed.
