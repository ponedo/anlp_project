692 F.3d 1272
United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
Woodrow WOODS and Marine Exhaust Systems, Inc., Plaintiffs-Appellees,
v.
DeANGELO MARINE EXHAUST, INC., Defendant-Appellant.
No. 2010-1478.
|
Aug. 28, 2012.
Synopsis
Background: Owner and exclusive licensee of patents relating to water jacketed marine exhaust systems brought infringement action against competitor. Following a jury trial, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Daniel T.K. Hurley, J., found the patents valid and infringed, and denied competitor's motions for judgment as a matter of law (JMOL) and for sanctions. Competitor appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Linn, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
competitor's purported supplement to interrogatory violated the discovery rules;
 
district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding drawings disclosed by competitor as a sanction;
 
legally sufficient basis existed on which jury could have found competitor's notched diffusers infringed patents; and
 
district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to sanction exclusive licensee under Rule 11.
 
Affirmed.
