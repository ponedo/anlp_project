Synopsis
Background: Owners of patent concerning controlled-release oral pharmaceutical compositions for treating inflammatory bowel diseases brought infringement action against competitor. After construing certain relevant claim language, 2013 WL 174843, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Donald M. Middlebrooks, J., 2013 WL 1912208, found the competitor's product infringed the patent. Competitor appealed. The Court of Appeals, 746 F.3d 1326, reversed and remanded. Patentee petitioned for writ of certiorari, and the Supreme Court granted the writ and vacated and remanded, 135 S.Ct. 1174.
 
Holdings: On remand, the Court of Appeals, Hughes, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
term, "matrix," meant a macroscopically homogeneous structure in all its volume, and
 
terms, "inner lipophilic matrix" and "outer hydrophilic matrix," required two separate matrices, such that the matrices retained their claimed properties and were consistent with their respective Markush group limitations.
 
Reversed and remanded.
