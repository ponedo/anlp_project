Federal Circuit.
KINETIC CONCEPTS, INC., KCI Licensing, Inc., KCI USA, Inc., KCI Medical Resources, KCI Manufacturing, and Medical Holdings Limited, Plaintiffs,
and
Wake Forest University Health Sciences, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
SMITH & NEPHEW, INC., Defendant-Appellee.
No. 2011-1105.

Aug. 13, 2012.
Synopsis
Background: Patentee filed action against competitor alleging infringement of patents on apparatus and method of treating tissue damage by applying negative or reduced pressure to wound over area sufficient to promote migration of epithelial and subcutaneous tissue toward wound and for time period sufficient to facilitate closure of wound. The United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, W. Royal Furgeson, Jr., J., granted judgment as matter of law (JMOL) of invalidity for obviousness. Patentee appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, O'Malley, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
district court was required to accept all implicit factual findings supporting jury's conclusion with respect to ultimate conclusion of nonobviousness that were supported by substantial evidence;
 
substantial evidence supported finding that prior art references did not disclose treating wounds with negative pressure as required by patents;
 
court had to assume that jury found patentee's expert to be credible and persuasive in his opinion that prior art reference did not disclose use of negative pressure to heal wounds as patents did;
 
court had to defer to factual finding by jury that there was no reason to combine prior art references;
 
substantial evidence supported jury's findings of objective indicia of nonobviousness; and
 
competitor did not show that patents were obvious.
 
Reversed and remanded.
 
Dyk, Circuit Judge, filed concurring opinion.
