United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
INTERNATIONAL VISUAL CORPORATION, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
CROWN METAL MANUFACTURING CO., INC., Defendant-Appellee.
No. 92-1262.
|
April 15, 1993.
Synopsis
Holder of patent on magnetically secured display apparatus sued competitor alleging infringement of patents. Competitor counterclaimed for declaratory judgment of noninfringement, invalidity, and unenforceability. On cross motions for summary judgment, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, James F. Holderman, Jr., J., granted summary judgment of noninfringement in favor of competitor. Patent holder appealed. The Court of Appeals held that: (1) district court's determination of noninfringement of patent was based on erroneous interpretation of housing limitation as requiring that housing be separate and apart from permanent magnet means, and (2) remand was appropriate based upon court's claim interpretation so that district court could decide issue of doctrine of equivalents.
 
Reversed and remanded.
 
Lourie, Circuit Judge, concurred and filed opinion.
