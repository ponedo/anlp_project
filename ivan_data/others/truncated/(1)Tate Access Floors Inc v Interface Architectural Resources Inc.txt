Synopsis
Holder of patent for raised access flooring panels brought patent infringement suit against competitor, and sought preliminary injunctive relief. The United States District Court for the District of Maryland, J. Frederick Motz, J., granted injunction, 132 F.Supp.2d 365. Competitor appealed. The Court of Appeals, Gajarsa, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) competitor's assertion that accused device merely practiced the prior art, or that which would have been obvious in light of the prior art, did not provide defense to claim of literal infringement, and (2) district court did not abuse its discretion by determining that holder had demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of success on merits sufficient to warrant injunctive relief.
 
Affirmed.
