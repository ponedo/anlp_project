CUMBERLAND PHARMACEUTICALS INC., Plaintiff-Appellee
v.
MYLAN INSTITUTIONAL LLC, Mylan Inc., Defendants-Appellants
2016-1155, 2016-1259
|
Decided: January 26, 2017
Synopsis
Background: Owner of patent related to administration of intravenous treatment for suspected acetaminophen overdoses which was substantially free of metal chelating agents brought infringement action against generic drug manufacturer. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Rebecca R. Pallmeyer, J., construed patent, 2014 WL 787812, and, following bench trial, ruled patent valid and infringed, 137 F.Supp.3d 1108. Defendant appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Taranto, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
evidence supported district court's finding that patent was not invalid based on derivation, and
 
district court did not clearly err in finding that patent was not invalid for obviousness.
 
Affirmed.
 
*1214 Appeals from the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in No. 1:12-cv-03846, Judge Rebecca R. Pallmeyer.
