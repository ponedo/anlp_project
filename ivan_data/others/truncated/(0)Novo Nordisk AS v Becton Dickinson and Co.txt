Federal Circuit.
NOVO NORDISK A/S, Novo Nordisk of North America, Inc., and Novo Nordisk Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Plaintiffs-Appellants,
v.
BECTON DICKINSON AND COMPANY, Defendant-Cross Appellant.
Nos. 01-1095, 01-1114.
|
DECIDED: Sept. 19, 2002.
Synopsis
Owner of insulin syringe patents sued competitor for infringement. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Barbara S. Jones, J., granted judgment for competitor, 96 F.Supp.2d 309. Owner appealed. The Court of Appeals, Pauline Newman, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) substantial evidence existed for reasonable jury to conclude that patent on insulin syringe was invalid as obvious; (2) miscarriage of justice did not occur by court's refusal to include jury instruction that "obvious to try" was not correct legal standard for determination of obviousness; (3) new trial was not warranted on grounds of prejudice; and (4) competitor could not appeal district court's denial of its motion for summary judgment.
 
Affirmed.
