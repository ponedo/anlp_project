Synopsis
Owner of reexamined patent for in-line roller skate brought infringement action against competitor. The United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, Carolyn R. Dimmick, Senior Judge, 1998 WL 1032110,granted summary judgment of noninfringement in favor of competitor, and owner appealed. The Court of Appeals, Clevenger, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) limitation requiring skate's bootie to be "permanently affixed" to skate's base at both heel and toe required that fastening be unremovable; (2) patent was not literally infringed; (3) patent was not infringed under doctrine of equivalents; but (4) Warner-Jenkinson presumption in favor of prosecution history estoppel was inapplicable.
 
Affirmed.
 
Rader, Circuit Judge, filed dissenting opinion.
