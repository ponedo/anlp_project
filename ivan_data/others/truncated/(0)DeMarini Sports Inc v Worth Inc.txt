DeMARINI SPORTS, INC., Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
WORTH, INC., Defendant-Cross Appellant.

|
Decided Feb. 13, 2001.
Synopsis
Patentee brought suit against competitor, alleging that its patent for high-performance double-walled aluminum softball bat had been infringed. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the United States District Court for the District of Oregon, Garr M. King, J., 1999 WL 571074,granted summary judgment to competitor. Patentee appealed. The Court of Appeals, Linn, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) term "frame," as modified by term "bat," and used in patent, was a tubular structure having a large-diameter impact portion, a tapered portion, and a small-diameter handle, all of which are connected when the bat is fully constructed; (2) claim describing an internal structural insert inside large-diameter impact portion required that impact portion be part of bat frame; (3) "insert," as used in patent, meant a piece of material that was separate from, and completely surrounded by frame; and (4) competitor's bat, which featured an external shell over hitting end, did not infringe patent literally or under doctrine of equivalents.
 
Affirmed.
