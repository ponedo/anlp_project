Synopsis
Owner of patent for gamma radiation unit brought infringement action against seller of accused device. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Lawrence M. McKenna, J., 51 F.Supp.2d 478, granted summary judgment of infringement in favor of owner, and seller appealed. The Court of Appeals, Lourie, Circuit Judge, held that patent required that radiation sources and beam channels be located only within zone extending between latitudes of 30° and 45°, so patent was not literally infringed.
 
Reversed.
