Synopsis
Patentee for surgical implant device to correct deformities or traumas in human spine brought infringement action against competitor. The United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, Larry J. McKinney, J., 1994 WL 846541,denied patentee's motion for preliminary injunction, and patentee appealed. The Court of Appeals, Rader, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) patentee failed to show likelihood of success on merits in view of patent claim's limitations on "body attaching means"; (2) trial court gave undue weight to prosecution history; (3) competitor's device did not likely infringe under doctrine of equivalents; and (4) patentee did not show irreparable harm.
