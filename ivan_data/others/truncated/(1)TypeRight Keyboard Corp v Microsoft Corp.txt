374 F.3d 1151
United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
TYPERIGHT KEYBOARD CORPORATION, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
MICROSOFT CORPORATION, Defendant-Cross Appellant.
Nos. 03-1197, 03-1255.
|
Decided: July 6, 2004.
Synopsis
Background: Owner of patents on ergonomic computer keyboards brought infringement action against competitor. The United States District Court for the Southern District of California, Irma E. Gonzalez, J., granted summary judgment of invalidity to competitor, but dismissed competitor's counterclaims for inequitable conduct and non-infringement. Owner appealed, and competitor cross-appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Dyk, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction over competitor's cross-appeal, and
 
genuine issue of material fact as to whether alleged prior art reference was publicly distributed prior to patent's critical date precluded summary judgment of patent invalidity.
 
Reversed and remanded.
