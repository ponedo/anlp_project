Synopsis
Background: Patentee brought action against competitor, seeking declaration that its patents for pediatric asthma drug would be infringed by competitor's generic version of drug. The United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, Renee Marie Bumb, J., 623 F.Supp.2d 579, entered order granting preliminary injunction for patentee, and subsequently entered order supplementing its initial opinion, 623 F.Supp.2d 615. Competitor appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Linn, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
term "budesonide composition" meant a budesonide dispersed in a solvent, and
 
proposed label for competitor's generic drug would induce consumers in infringe patent.
 
Affirmed.
 
Bryson, Circuit Judge, filed opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.
