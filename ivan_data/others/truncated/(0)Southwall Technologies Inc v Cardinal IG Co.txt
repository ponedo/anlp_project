Synopsis
Patentee brought infringement action in connection with patent for heat mirror, a coating applied to surfaces which allowed visible light to pass through but reflected heat, which was useful as window glazing material. The United States District Court for the Northern District of California, D. Lowell Jensen, J., granted summary judgment of noninfringement for defendant, and patentee appealed. The Court of Appeals, Michel, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) defendant's heat mirror did not literally infringe patent as it did not have "sputter-deposited" dielectric layer, and (2) claim of infringement under doctrine of equivalents was barred by prosecution history estoppel.
 
Affirmed.
