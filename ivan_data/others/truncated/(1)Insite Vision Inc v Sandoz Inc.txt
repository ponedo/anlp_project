United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
INSITE VISION INCORPORATED, Inspire Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Pfizer Inc., Plaintiffs-Appellees
v.
SANDOZ, INC., Defendant-Appellant
Sandoz GmbH, Sandoz Industrial Products S.A., Defendants.
No. 2014-1065.

April 9, 2015.
Synopsis
Background: Patentee brought action against a competitor, claiming that the competitor's filing of an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) for a generic drug to treat eye infections infringed on four patents that disclosed methods of treating eye infections by the topical administration of azithromycin, an antibiotic, to the eye. Following a bench trial, the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, Mary L. Cooper, J., 2013 WL 5975015, upheld the validity of all of the patents-in-suit. The competitor appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Linn, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
the competitor failed to demonstrate that treating conjunctivitis with a topical application of azithromycin would have been obvious to persons of ordinary skill in the art;
 
the competitor failed to demonstrate that using topical azithromycin in a gel eyedrop for treating eye infections was obvious to persons of ordinary skill in the art; and
 
the District Court did not abuse its excluding evidence of European patent proceedings.
 
Affirmed.
