Synopsis
Background: Patentee brought action against United States, alleging that process used to produce carbon fiber sheet materials for military aircraft infringed patent for method of producing carbon fiber sheet products. Following three-day bench trial on issue of validity, the Court of Federal Claims, Edward J. Damich, Senior Judge, ruled that patent was invalid on grounds of obviousness and inadequate written description. Patentee appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Newman, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
patent was not invalid for having inadequate written description, and
 
patent was not invalid for obviousness.
 
Reversed and remanded.
