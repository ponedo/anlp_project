United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
TRANSWEB, LLC, Plaintiff-Appellee
v.
3M INNOVATIVE PROPERTIES COMPANY, 3M Company, Defendants-Appellants.
No. 2014-1646.
|
Feb. 10, 2016.
Synopsis
Background: Competitor brought action against holder of patents for method of producing filtration membranes used in industrial respirators, seeking declaratory judgment of invalidity, unenforceability, and non-infringement, and also asserting a Walker Process antitrust claim. The United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, Faith S. Hochberg, J., 16 F.Supp.3d 385, entered judgment in favor of competitor, and patent holder appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Hughes, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
evidence established that samples of plasma-fluorinated filtration membrane given out at a trade show was a public disclosure that invalidated the patents;
 
evidence established that patentee engaged in inequitable conduct in obtaining patents;
 
evidence supported competitor's antitrust claim; and
 
attorney fees incurred by competitor defending prior infringement suit were antitrust injury and thus could form the basis for treble damages under the Clayton Act.
 
Affirmed.
