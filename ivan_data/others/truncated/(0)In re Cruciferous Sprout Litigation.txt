Synopsis
Actions brought by patent holders regarding the validity of certain patents, all involving the production and the consumption of the sprouts of certain types of cruciferous seeds such as broccoli and cauliflower, were consolidated by the Judicial Panel for Multidistrict Litigation for pre-trial purposes. The United States District Court for the District of Maryland, William M. Nickerson, J., granted summary judgment of invalidity on basis that invention was anticipated by prior art, 168 F.Supp.2d 534. Patentee appealed. The Court of Appeals, Prost, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) preamble was limitation of claims, and (2) patent claims were invalid by anticipation.
 
Affirmed.
