Synopsis
Toy manufacturer brought action against competitors, alleging design patent infringement, trade dress infringement, and state-law unfair competition. One competitor brought claim alleging patent invalidity. The United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Saundra Brown Armstrong, J., granted summary judgment for competitors, and manufacturer appealed. Competitor cross-appealed from decision granting summary judgment in favor of manufacturer on patent invalidity claim. The Court of Appeals, Lourie, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) as matter of first impression, relevant subject matter for patentability purposes was prior art for purpose of obviousness inquiry; (2) manufacturer did not engage in inequitable conduct; (3) patented design was not obvious; (4) competitors' products did not infringe patent; and (5) competitors did not infringe trade dress of manufacturer's product or packaging.
 
Affirmed.
