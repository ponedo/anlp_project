Synopsis
Background: Inventor brought action in state court against law firm, alleging that it committed legal malpractice in prosecuting his patent application for a hand tool. After removal, the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, 2010 WL 5419004, William J. Martini, J., granted summary judgment in favor inventor, and firm appealed.
 
The Court of Appeals, Reyna, Circuit Judge, held that patent attorney was not liable for legal malpractice in case under a suit-within-a-suit framework where inventor failed to introduce evidence sufficient to establish the nonobviousness of the proposed alternate claims, which attorney failed to include in application written and prosecuted by attorney.
 
Affirmed.
 
O'Malley, Circuit Judge, filed opinion concurring in the result.
