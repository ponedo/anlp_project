Synopsis
Patentee brought action against alleged infringer of patent for cut-resistant yarn used in making cut-resistant gloves. The United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, William L. Osteen, Sr., J., found that patent was not invalid, that patent was not obtained by means of inequitable conduct, and that patent was infringed, and awarded damages based upon reasonable royalty. Alleged infringer appealed. The Court of Appeals, Lourie, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) patent specification contained sufficient written description of claimed wrapping rate for yarn's two strand core; (2) distribution of gloves before critical date was for experimental purposes and patent was thus not invalid under statutory on-sale bar; (3) patent was not invalid as obvious; (4) patentee did not engage in inequitable conduct; (5) documents offered by alleged infringer did not satisfy business records exception to hearsay rule; (6) alleged infringer was not entitled to damages or attorney fees; and (7) patentee was not entitled to damages for frivolous appeal.
 
Affirmed.
