United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
LIFE TECHNOLOGIES, INC., Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
CLONTECH LABORATORIES, INC., Defendant-Appellee.
No. 99-1550.
|
Sept. 21, 2000
Synopsis
Patentee brought action against competitor, alleging infringement of patents for engineered reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme. Following bench trial, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, Alexander Williams, Jr., J., held that patents were unenforceable on ground of inequitable conduct, and patentee appealed. The Court of Appeals, Gajarsa, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) manner in which inventors used prior art article that was disclosed during patent application process and motivations that inventors derived from article were not "material" to application; (2) inventors' assertion that they had no reasonable expectation of success as to their following of prior art article was not affirmative representation that would support finding of inequitable conduct; and (3) inventors' failure to disclose information regarding work of rival researcher did not amount to inequitable conduct.
 
Reversed and remanded.
