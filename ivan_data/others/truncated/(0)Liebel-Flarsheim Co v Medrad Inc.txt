Synopsis
Background: Owner of patents for methods of injecting fluids into patients during medical procedures sued competitor for infringement. The United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio granted summary judgment of noninfringement, and owner appealed. The Court of Appeals, 358 F.3d 898,reversed and remanded. On remand, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Sandra S. Beckwith, Chief Judge, granted competitor's motion for summary judgment that four of patents were invalid, granted patent owner's motion for summary judgment that competitor infringed patents and that inventorship designation on patents was correct, and held that inequitable conduct counterclaim was moot. Patent owner appealed and competitor cross-appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Lourie, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
claims of patents directed to a front-loading fluid injector were invalid for lack of enablement;
 
prior art anticipated claims of syringe-sensing patents; and
 
inequitable conduct counterclaim was moot.
 
Affirmed.
