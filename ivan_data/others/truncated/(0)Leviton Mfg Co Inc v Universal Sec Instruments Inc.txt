Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc Denied Aug. 11, 2010.
Synopsis
Background: Patentee brought infringement action against competitor and manufacturer of accused products, alleging infringement of patent involving ground-fault circuit interrupter technology. Following patentee's voluntary dismissal of claims, manufacturer filed motion for attorney fees and costs. The United States District Court for the District of Maryland, Andre M. Davis, 613 F.Supp.2d 670, granted motion, and patentee appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Michel, Chief Judge, held that:
 
patentee's failure to disclose information regarding prior patent application was "material" for purpose of determining whether patentee committed inequitable conduct;
 
patentee's failure to disclose existence of earlier related litigation was "material" for purpose of determining whether patentee committed inequitable conduct; but
 
fact issues as to whether patentee intended to deceive Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) precluded summary judgment for inequitable conduct; and
 
patentee did not engage in vexatious litigation by refusing to answer deposition questions on basis of work-product doctrine.
 
Vacated and remanded.
 
Prost, Circuit Judge, filed dissenting opinion.
