Decided: September 10, 2018
Synopsis
Background: Patentee brought action against competitor, alleging that competitor's filing of abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) seeking to market generic sublingual tablet infringed patent for method of sublingually administering tablet and patent for sublingual tablet used for treatment of opioid dependence. The United States District Court for the District of Delaware, No. 1:14-cv-00829-SLR-SRF, Sue L. Robinson, J., 217 F.Supp.3d 756, granted judgment for competitor in part after finding at bench trial that some claims of one patent were invalid on ground of obviousness. Patentee appealed.
 
The Court of Appeals, Newman, Circuit Judge, held that prior art did not suggest selection and combination achieved by inventors in sublingual drug formulation that provided improved treatment of opioid dependence.
 
Reversed and remanded.
 
Procedural Posture(s): On Appeal; Judgment.
