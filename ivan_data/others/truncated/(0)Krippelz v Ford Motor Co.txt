Federal Circuit.
Jacob KRIPPELZ, Sr., Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
FORD MOTOR COMPANY, Defendant-Appellant.

Jan. 27, 2012.
|
Rehearing Denied March 12, 2012.
Synopsis
Background: Patentee brought action against manufacturer alleging infringement of patent on device to illuminate ground beside automobile. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, James B. Zagel, J., 670 F.Supp.2d 815, entered order awarding patentee $21,017,400 in damages, and denied manufacturer's motion for judgment as matter of law and for new trial, 750 F.Supp.2d 938. Manufacturer appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Prost, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
phrase, "conical beam of light," in patent was limited to reflector having focal point;
 
prior French patent that taught "system of lamps and optical devices" anticipated conical beam limitation in patent in suit; and
 
prior patent anticipated adjacent to side window limitation.
 
Reversed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.
