Synopsis
Holder of patent for handbells brought action against competitor alleging infringement under doctrine of equivalents. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Edmund V. Ludwig, J., granted judgment n.o.v. for the defendant, and appeal was taken. The Court of Appeals, Rich, Circuit Judge, held that patent holder failed to establish infringement under doctrine of equivalents absent testimony sufficiently explaining both why overall function, way, and result of accused device was substantially same as those of claimed device and why accused device's plastic/slotted, plastic/felt arrangement was equivalent of claimed buttons limitation.
