United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
GEO. M. MARTIN COMPANY and the Martin Family Trust-1989, Plaintiffs-Appellants,
v.
ALLIANCE MACHINE SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL LLC, Defendant-Cross Appellant.
Nos. 2009-1132, 2009-1151.

Aug. 20, 2010.
Synopsis
Background: Patent holder and its exclusive licensee brought action against competitor alleging infringement of patent directed to improvement of bundle breakers. After patent was construed, 2007 WL 4105832, and ruled not infringed in part, 560 F.Supp.2d 893, competitor moved for judgment as matter of law on issue of invalidity for obviousness. The United States District Court for the Northern District of California, William H. Alsup, J., 634 F.Supp.2d 1024, granted motion. Plaintiffs appealed validity ruling, and competitor cross-appealed determination that licensee had standing to sue for lost profit damages.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Rader, Chief Judge, held that:
 
patent was obvious, and thus invalid, and
 
secondary considerations of non-obviousness did not create reasonable dispute that patent was obvious.
 
Affirmed.
