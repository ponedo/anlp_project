644 F.3d 1376
United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
DURAMED PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. (now known as Teva Women's Health, Inc.), Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
PADDOCK LABORATORIES, INC., Defendant-Appellee.
No. 2010-1419.
|
July 21, 2011.
Synopsis
Background: Patentee filed action against competitor alleging that manufacture and marketing of generic version of conjugated estrogen tablets infringed patent. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Leonard B. Sand, Senior District Judge, 715 F.Supp.2d 552, granted summary judgment of noninfringement. Patentee appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Lourie, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
presumption of prosecution history estoppel applied;
 
polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) moisture barrier coating (MBC) to inhibit absorption of moisture and reduce storage-related degradation of conjugated estrogen tablets need only have been known in field of pharmaceutical compositions as of time of patentee's narrowing amendment for prosecution history estoppel to apply; and
 
international patent application rendered use of PVA as MBC foreseeable.
 
Affirmed.
