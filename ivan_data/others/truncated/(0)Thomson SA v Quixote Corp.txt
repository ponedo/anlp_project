United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
THOMSON, S.A., Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
QUIXOTE CORPORATION and Disc Manufacturing, Inc., Defendants-Appellees.
No. 97-1485.
|
Jan. 25, 1999.
Synopsis
Patentee brought action against competitors, alleging that competitors' manufacture and sale of optical disc products, including digital audio compact discs, violated four of its patents. After jury returned verdict in favor of competitors, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Joseph J. Longobardi, Chief Judge, 979 F.Supp. 286, denied patentee's motion for judgment as matter of law (JMOL). Patentee appealed. The Court of Appeals, Rich, Circuit Judge, held that testimony of purported inventors of unpatented laser videodisc that allegedly anticipated patents did not require corroboration to support finding that patents were invalid.
 
Affirmed.
