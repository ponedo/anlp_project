United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
INTENDIS GMBH, Intraserv GmbH & Co. KG, Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals Inc., Plaintiffs-Appellees
v.
GLENMARK PHARMACEUTICALS INC., USA, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Defendants-Appellants.
No. 2015-1902.

May 16, 2016.
Synopsis
Background: Patent licensees brought action against generic drug manufacturer, alleging infringement arising from manufacturer's Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for drug indicated for topical treatment of inflammatory papules and pustules of mild to moderate rosacea. Following Markman hearing and bench trial, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Sue L. Robinson, J., 117 F.Supp.3d 549, found, inter alia, that licensees proved infringement under doctrine of equivalents. Manufacturer appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Moore, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
there was no clear error in district court's decision that the isopropyl myristate in generic drug manufacturer's product and the claimed triglyceride and lecithin performed substantially the same function, under the doctrine of equivalents;
 
there was no reversible error in district court's finding infringement under the doctrine of equivalents did not ensnare prior art;
 
there was no error in district court's determination that prosecution history estoppel did not apply; and
 
there was no clear error in the district court's findings with respect to objective indicia of nonobviousness.
 
Affirmed.
