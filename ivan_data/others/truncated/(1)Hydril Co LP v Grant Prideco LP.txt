Synopsis
Background: Competitor brought action against patent holder, alleging that patent holder monopolized two product markets by enforcing a fraudulently obtained patent, infringed a separate patent owned by competitor, and breached parties' contract. The United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Nancy F. Atlas, J., 2005 WL 1515422,dismissed patent claim, and, in a separate opinion, 385 F.Supp.2d 609,dismissed antitrust claims and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over contract claim. Competitor appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Friedman, Senior Circuit Judge, held that:
 
competitor stated claim for violation of Sherman Act's antimonopoly provision, and
 
parties' merger and technology licensing agreement did not preclude competitor's patent infringement claim.
 
Reversed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.
 
Mayer, Circuit Judge, filed dissenting opinion.
