Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc Denied Oct. 14, 2010.
Synopsis
Background: Patent holder filed action against competitor alleging infringement of patents directed toward methods of informing patients about and administering muscle relaxant metaxalone. Competitor asserted affirmative defenses and counterclaims for invalidity, fraud, and unclean hands. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, David G. Trager, Senior District Judge, 593 F.Supp.2d 501, invalidated patents. Plaintiff appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Gajarsa, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
claim directed toward methods of informing patients about and administering muscle relaxant metaxalone was invalid due to anticipation;
 
broad terms used in patent's claims could not be limited to specific food conditions disclosed in written description;
 
claims limiting time frame in which patient had to ingest metaxalone had been anticipated by prior;
 
instructional limitation, that taking drug with food increased bioavailability of drug, had been anticipated;
 
printed label claim had been anticipated;
 
commercial success of patented product was not objective indication of nonobviousness;
 
patent claim directed toward methods of informing patients about and administering muscle relaxant metaxalone was obvious; and
 
actual case or controversy did not exist between competitor and corporation after corporation sold all its interests in asserted patents to another entity.
 
Affirmed and vacated in part.
