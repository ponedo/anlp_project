United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
BALL AEROSOL AND SPECIALTY CONTAINER, INC., Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.

Synopsis
Background: Assignee brought action against competitors alleging infringement of patent related to candle holder apparatus. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Samuel Der-Yeghiayan, J., construed disputed claims, 2006 WL 1049581, concluded that competitors had infringed patent, 514 F.Supp.2d 1051, and denied reconsideration, 553 F.Supp.2d 939. Competitors appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Lourie, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
phrase, "to seat," did not require engagement between feet and cover;
 
combination of putting feet on bottom of candle holder and using cover as base for candle holder was predictable variation, and thus patent was obvious;
 
minimal indications of commercial success did not outweigh clear indication of obviousness apparent from prior art; and
 
patent had not been infringed by accused product that was reasonably capable of being put into claimed configuration.
 
Reversed, vacated, and remanded.
