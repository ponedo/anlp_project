Synopsis
In action for patent infringement and breach of contract, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Reena Raggi, J., held defendants liable for infringement and breach of contract and enjoined them from further infringement. Defendants appealed. The Court of Appeals, Lourie, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) when no motions for judgment notwithstanding verdict or new trial are made in district court after jury verdict, prejudicial legal error must be shown to have occurred in conduct of trial in order for Court of Appeals to vacate judgment of district court and remand for new trial; (2) district court did not abuse its discretion in barring infringers' expert from testifying as to how claims were to be drafted to avoid prior art and that claims in suit read on prior art; (3) district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that infringement of patent was willful, warranting award of treble damages and attorney fees; and (4) defendant patent assignor was properly barred from contesting validity or enforceability of patent, even though he was also licensee under patent.
 
Affirmed.
