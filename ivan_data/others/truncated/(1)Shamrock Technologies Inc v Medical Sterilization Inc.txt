Federal Circuit.
SHAMROCK TECHNOLOGIES, INC., Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
MEDICAL STERILIZATION, INC., and Robert S. Luniewski, Defendants-Appellants.
No. 89-1711.

Synopsis
Holder of patent for apparatus and method for processing polytetrafluoroethylene with radiation brought action against former employee-inventor and former employee's current employer alleging infringement. Inventor and current employer counterclaimed for declaration of invalidity. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Jacob Mishler, J., applied doctrine of assignor estoppel and granted patent holder partial summary judgment. Appeal was taken. The Court of Appeals, Markey, Chief Judge, held that: (1) patent was infringed by radiation processing used by current employer, and (2) doctrine of assignor estoppel applied.
 
Affirmed.
