Synopsis
Background: Patentee sued competitor for infringement of its patent directed to method and apparatus for handling waste water slurries in storage tanks. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, 2002 WL 1769979, Suzanne B. Conlon, J., granted summary judgment of non-infringement, and patentee appealed. The Court of Appeals, 355 F.3d 1361,vacated and remanded. On remand, the District Court, 2005 WL 711993, entered judgment in favor of patentee, and competitor appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Gajarsa, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
substantial evidence supported determination that all 47 of competitor's storage tanks infringed structural limitations of patent;
 
evidence was sufficient to establish that there was helical flow in competitor's storage tanks, as claimed in patent;
 
evidence was sufficient to establish that competitor indented foreign purchasers to infringe the patent;
 
evidence established that patent disclosed best mode for practicing the invention;
 
evidence was sufficient to establish that the patent was enabling;
 
evidence was sufficient to finding of willful infringement; and
 
patentee's failure to disclose two prior art storage tank installations was not inequitable conduct invalidating the patent.
 
Affirmed.
