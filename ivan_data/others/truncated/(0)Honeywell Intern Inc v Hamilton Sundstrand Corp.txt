Rehearing En Banc Denied May 29, 2008.
Synopsis
Background: Owners of patents claiming technology to control airflow surge in auxiliary power units (APUs) brought infringement action against competitor. After the Court of Appeals vacated an infringement verdict in favor of owners and remanded, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Gregory M. Sleet, J., 2006 WL 2346446, barred owners from asserting doctrine of equivalents. Owners appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Rader, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
equivalent proposed by owners was foreseeable and thus precluded by prosecution history estoppel principles;
 
judicial estoppel did not apply to bar competitor from reversing its prior position that its surge control system was unique; and
 
alleged equivalent bore a direct, not merely tangential, relation to amendment, and therefore tangentiality criterion did not exempt owner from presumption of patent prosecution history estoppel.
 
Affirmed.
 
Newman, Circuit Judge, dissented and filed opinion.
