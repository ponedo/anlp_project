Synopsis
Background: Patentee brought infringement action against competitors for infringement of patents relating to a method for treating migraines by combining two drugs in a single tablet, seeking a permanent injunction against competitors from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing into the United States accused Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) products. Following claim construction, 719 F.Supp.2d 718, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Leonard Davis, J., 800 F.Supp.2d 789, entered judgment in favor of patentee, and enjoined competitors. Competitors appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Wallach, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
prior art references did not render patents invalid for obviousness;
 
district court did not clearly err in determining one of the patents satisfied the written description requirement; and
 
district court did not clearly err in concluding that accused products infringed one of the patents under doctrine of equivalents.
 
Affirmed.
 
Clevenger, Circuit Judge, filed an opinion dissenting in part.
