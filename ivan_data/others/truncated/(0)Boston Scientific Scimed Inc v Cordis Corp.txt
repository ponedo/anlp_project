Synopsis
Background: Patentee sued competitor, alleging infringement of its patent for a expandable stent with a drug-eluting coating. After jury returned verdict in favor of patentee, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Robinson, Chief Judge, denied competitor's motions for judgment as a matter of law, 434 F.Supp.2d 308, and for new trial, 2007 WL 2775087. Competitor appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Lourie, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
District Court reasonably construed "non-thrombogenic" limitation of patent;
 
District Court also reasonably construed "long term non-thrombogenicity" limitation; and
 
prior art rendered patent obvious.
 
Reversed.
