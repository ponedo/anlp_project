v.

No. 2006-1261.

March 22, 2007.
Synopsis
Background: Owner of patent for name-brand hypertension drug sued proposed manufacturer of generic version for infringement. Following a bench trial, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, James M. Rosenbaum, Chief Judge, entered a final judgment for patent owner. Manufacturer appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Michel, Chief Judge, held that:
 
clear and convincing evidence showed that a skilled artisan would have been motivated to combine prior art references to achieve the claimed invention;
 
manufacturer showed by clear and convincing evidence that a skilled artisan would have had reasonable expectation of success; and
 
clear and convincing evidence showed that it would have been obvious to optimize acid addition salt formulation for an active pharmaceutical ingredient in hypertension drug.
 
Reversed.
 
Linn, Circuit Judge, concurred in the result.
