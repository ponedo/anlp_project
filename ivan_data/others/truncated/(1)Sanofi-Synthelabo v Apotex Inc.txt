Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc Denied March 26, 2009.
Synopsis
Background: Owners of patent covering pharmaceutical product clopidogrel bisulfate brought infringement action against competitors and competitors counterclaimed that the patent was invalid and unenforceable. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Sidney H. Stein, J., 492 F.Supp.2d 353, in a bench trial, ruled that the patent was valid and enforceable. Competitors appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Newman, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
prior art patents did not anticipate patent, and
 
district court did not clearly err in making finding of nonobviousness.
 
Affirmed.
