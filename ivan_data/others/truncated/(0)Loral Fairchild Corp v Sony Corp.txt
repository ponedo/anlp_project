Synopsis
Patent assignee brought infringement action against electronics manufacturer. After jury returned verdict in favor of assignee on issues of ownership, validity, and infringement under the doctrine of equivalents, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, 931 F.Supp. 1014, granted manufacturer's motion for judgment as matter of law (JMOL), holding that manufacturer did not infringe patents. Assignee appealed. The Court of Appeals, Archer, Senior Circuit Judge, held that: (1) process patent was not infringed literally or under doctrine of equivalents; (2) patent for structure of charge coupled device (CCD) was not infringed under doctrine of equivalents; and (3) assignee was barred by prosecution history estoppel from asserting that accused devices infringed structure patent.
 
Affirmed.
