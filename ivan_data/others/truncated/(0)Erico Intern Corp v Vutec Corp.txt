Background: Patentee brought action against competitor, alleging infringement of patent claiming method of supporting a bundle of low voltage communications cable with a J-hook fastener.

Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Rader, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
patent was not invalid due to inequitable conduct;
 
patent was not invalid under the statutory on-sale bar; but
 
evidence raised substantial question as to whether patent was invalid as obvious.
 
Vacated.
