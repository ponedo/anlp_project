492 F.3d 1326
United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
The SAUNDERS GROUP, INC., Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
COMFORTRAC, INC., and Care Rehab and Orthopaedic Products Inc., Defendants-Appellees.
No. 2006-1576.

June 27, 2007.
Synopsis
Background: Patent holder brought action against competitor alleging infringement of patent directed toward relatively inexpensive and lightweight cervical traction device. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Leonie M. Brinkema, J., granted summary judgment of non-infringement. Patent holder appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Bryson, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
term "pneumatic cylinder," encompassed cylinders that did not use pressure activated seals;
 
claim differentiation doctrine supported inference that independent claim encompassed cylinders without pressure activated seals;
 
specification did not support narrowing construction that pressure activated seal was essential component of patent;
 
prosecution history of parent patent, that distinguished prior art based on presence or absence of pressure activated seal, was inapplicable to patent in suit;
 
statements in prosecution history about traction force that applied to both parent patent and patent in suit did not establish that cylinder in patent in suit had to contain pressure activated seal;
 
statements in prosecution history arguing only that particular seal disclosed in prior art would not be feasible for use in patent because it did not maintain required traction force did not demonstrate relationship between maintaining traction force and presence of pressure activated seals; and
 
inclusion of "pressure activated seal" limitation in some claims in patent in suit, and its omission from others, was sufficiently powerful indicator as to proper construction of asserted claims that it outweighed portions of specification in which invention was described narrowly.
 
Reversed and remanded.
