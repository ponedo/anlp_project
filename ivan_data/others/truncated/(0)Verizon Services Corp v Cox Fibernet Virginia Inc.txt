Synopsis
Background: Patentee brought action for infringement of patents for technology related to sending telephone calls in data packets through a network. Following jury trial, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Claude M. Hilton, Senior District Judge, entered judgment finding some the claims and valid and some of the claims not infringed, and both parties appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Linn, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
alleged infringer's arguments to the jury about claim scope did not subvert jury's ability to fairly decide the issues before it;
 
lack of instruction on incorporation by reference was harmless;
 
article on Internet telephony was enabling, as required for it to anticipate patents;
 
Internet and network protocols was a relevant field of art in determining whether patents were invalid as obvious;
 
expert testimony supported jury's determination that patents were invalid as anticipated; and
 
evidence supported jury's determination that patents were not infringed, regardless of whether district court misconstrued patent claim.
 
Affirmed.
