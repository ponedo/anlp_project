Synopsis
Patentee brought infringement action against competitor, alleging infringement of its patent covering process for binding "uncured" elastomers, such as silicone rubber, to polyolefins. The United States District Court for the Northern District of New York, Frederick J. Scullin, Jr., J., 19 F.Supp.2d 22, granted summary judgment of noninfringement, and patentee appealed. The Court of Appeals, Pauline Newman, Circuit Judge, held that prosecution history estoppel barred patentee from asserting infringement by competitor's process.
 
Affirmed.
