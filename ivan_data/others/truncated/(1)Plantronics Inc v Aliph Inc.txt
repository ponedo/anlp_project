United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
PLANTRONICS, INC., Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
ALIPH, INC. and Aliphcom, Inc., Defendants-Appellees.
No. 2012-1355.

July 31, 2013.
Synopsis
Background: Patentee filed action against competitor alleging infringement of patent directed toward concha-style headset for transmitting received sounds to ear of user, e.g., headsets used with cell phone receivers. Parties consented to final disposition by magistrate judge. The United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Bernard Zimmerman, United States Magistrate Judge, 2011 WL 4634066, construed the claims, and then ruled that patent was invalid and not infringed, 2012 WL 994636. Patentee appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Wallach, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
term, "stabilizer support member," meant structure that extended from ear cushion to concha stabilizer pad and stabilized headset;
 
term, "concha stabilizer," meant stabilizing structure dimensioned to extend between ear cushion and upper concha;
 
prosecution history disclaimer doctrine could not be applied to limit terms, "stabilizer support member" and "concha stabilizer," to elongated structure; and
 
factual issue existed as to whether patent was obvious.
 
Reversed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.
