Synopsis
Patentee brought infringement action against competitor over patent describing and claiming improved push rods for internal combustion engines. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Arthur J. Tarnow, J., granted summary judgment of invalidity. Patentee appealed. The Court of Appeals, Pauline Newman, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) usage of phrase "substantially constant wall thickness" did not of itself render claims indefinite, and (2) patent was not anticipated by prior art.
 
Reversed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.
