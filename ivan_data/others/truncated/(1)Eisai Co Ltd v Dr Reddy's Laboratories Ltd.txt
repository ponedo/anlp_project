Synopsis
Background: Patentee of patent claiming lead compound used in pharmaceutical approved for the treatment of duodenal ulcers, heartburn, and associated disorders brought infringement action against competitors. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Gerard E. Lynch, J., 472 F.Supp.2d 493, 2006 WL 2872615, granted in part and denied in part owner's motions for summary judgment, and found competitors infringed patent. Competitors appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Rader, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
prior art did not render patent obvious, and
 
patentee did not commit inequitable conduct in prosecuting patent application for patent.
 
Affirmed.
