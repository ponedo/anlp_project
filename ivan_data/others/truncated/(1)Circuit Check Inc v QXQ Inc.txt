Background: Owner of patents claiming systems and methods for marking interface plates filed patent infringement action against competitor. After jury verdict in patentee's favor, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, William C. Griesbach, J., 2014 WL 5361303, entered judgment as matter of law in competitor's favor, and patentee appealed.
 
The Court of Appeals, Moore, Circuit Judge, held that substantial evidence supported jury's determination that disputed prior art was not analogous to claimed systems and methods.
