Synopsis
Holder of two patents for single in-line memory module (SIMM) sued alleged infringer. Alleged infringer filed declaratory judgment action. Cases were consolidated. The United States District Court for the Central District of California, John G. Davies, J., granted partial summary judgment in favor of alleged infringer, 1994 WL 782694, and subsequently entered judgment on jury verdict in favor of alleged infringer, 1995 WL 491434. Parties appealed. The Court of Appeals, Rich, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) prosecution history estoppel precluded finding of infringement of one patent; (2) patentee had granted implied license to alleged infringer with respect to one patent; (3) patent was not invalid; and (4) one patent was literally infringed.
 
Affirmed.
 
Mayer, Circuit Judge, concurred in part and concurred in judgment.
