Decided: March 7, 2018
Synopsis
Background: Patentee brought action alleging that camera holders used in motor vehicles infringed its patent for removable book holder. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 1:15-cv-02465-LTS, Laura Taylor Swain, J., 230 F.Supp.3d 192, dismissed some claims, and entered summary judgment of non-infringement on remaining claims. Patentee appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Newman, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
collateral estoppel and stare decisis required that construction of term "removable mounting" in prior suit govern in subsequent action;
 
accused camera holders on motor vehicles did not infringe patent; and
 
book holder claimed by patent could not plausibly be construed to include or be equivalent of camera holder.
 
Affirmed.
 
Procedural Posture(s): On Appeal; Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim; Motion for Summary Judgment.
*1136 Appeal from the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in No. 1:15-cv-02465-LTS, Judge Laura Taylor Swain.
