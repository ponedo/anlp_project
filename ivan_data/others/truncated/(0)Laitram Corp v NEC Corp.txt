v.

No. 98-1060.

Dec. 18, 1998.
Synopsis
Patentee for electro-optical printer that printed alphanumeric characters on photosensitive recording medium brought infringement action against competitor. After jury returned verdict of infringement, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, Edith Brown Clement, J., 1994 WL 261966, granted judgment as matter of law (JMOL) for competitor as to claim of noninfringement. The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, 62 F.3d 1388. On remand, the District Court entered judgment of damages for patent infringement and denied competitor's motion for relief from judgment, 1995 WL 758904. The Court of Appeals, 115 F.3d 947, again reversed and remanded for consideration of previously unaddressed issue of claim identicality. On remand, the District Court, 1997 WL 539890,denied competitor's motion for JMOL that reexamined claims and original claims were not identical. Competitor appealed. The Court of Appeals, Lourie, Circuit Judge, held that scope of claims in reexamined patent was not identical to scope of original claims, due to addition of limitation that characters be of "type quality."
 
Reversed.
