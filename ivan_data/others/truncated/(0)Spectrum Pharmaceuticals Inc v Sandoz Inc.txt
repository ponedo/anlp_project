802 F.3d 1326
United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
SPECTRUM PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., University of Strathclyde, Plaintiffs-Appellants
v.
SANDOZ INC., Defendant-Appellee.
No. 2015-1407.
|
Oct. 2, 2015.
Synopsis
Background: In infringement suit related to patent directed to pharmaceutical compositions of substantially pure levoleucovorin, the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, Gloria M. Navarro, J., 2014 WL 7368845, granted defendant's motion for summary judgment of noninfringement with respect to certain patent claims, and, following bench trial, 2015 WL 794674, entered judgment for defendant, finding that two other patent claims were invalid as obvious. Patentee appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Lourie, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
claimed invention was obvious in light of prior art;
 
products that would be sold upon approval of defendant's Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) did not meet dosage claim limitation in subject patent; and
 
patentee was estopped from invoking doctrine of equivalents.
 
Affirmed.
