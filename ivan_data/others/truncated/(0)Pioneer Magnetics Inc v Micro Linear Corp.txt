Synopsis
Patentee brought action against competitor, alleging infringement of patent directed toward unity power factor power supply. The United States District Court for the Central District of California, Lourdes G. Baird, J., granted summary judgment of noninfringement, and patentee appealed. The Court of Appeals, Mayer, Chief Judge, affirmed, 238 F.3d 1341. Patentee appealed. The Supreme Court vacated and remanded, 535 U.S. 1108, 122 S.Ct. 2322, 153 L.Ed.2d 151. On remand, the Court of Appeals returned case for consideration to original merits panel, 42 Fed.Appx. 470. On motion for reconsideration, the Court of Appeals held that: (1) presumption arose that prosecution history estoppel applied to applicant's amendment of switching multiplier circuit claims limitations, and (2) patentee failed to overcome presumption that it surrendered non-switching multiplier circuit equivalent to switching multiplier circuit claims limitations.
 
Judgment of noninfringement affirmed.
