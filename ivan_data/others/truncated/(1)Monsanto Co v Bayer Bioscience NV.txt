Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc Denied April 17, 2008.
Synopsis
Background: Manufacturer of genetically modified corn seed brought declaratory judgment action against patentee challenging the validity and enforceability of four patents relating to the expression in plants of bacteria strains toxic to certain crop-destroying insects, and asserting its products did not infringe these patents. After the Court of Appeals, Bryson, Circuit Judge, 363 F.3d 1235,reversed and remanded the decision of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, E. Richard Webber, J., 264 F.Supp.2d 852, granting summary judgment in favor of manufacturer, the District Court, after a jury trial, declared asserted claims of one patent invalid and non-infringed, and all four patents unenforceable for inequitable conduct. Patentee appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Gajarsa, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
notes of one of patentee's employees were material to patent prosecution, and
 
District Court did not clearly err in concluding that patentee intentionally withheld notes with intent to deceive Patent and Trademark Office (PTO).
 
Affirmed.
