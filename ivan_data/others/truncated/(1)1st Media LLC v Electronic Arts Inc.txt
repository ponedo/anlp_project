Rehearing En Banc Denied Dec. 3, 2012.
Synopsis
Background: Assignee filed action against competitors alleging infringement of patent on entertainment system for use in purchasing and storing songs, videos, and multimedia karaoke information. Competitors asserted inequitable conduct defense and also counterclaimed for declaratory judgment of inequitable conduct. The United States District Court for the District of Nevada, James C. Mahan, J., granted competitors' requested declaratory judgment of inequitable conduct, held that patent was unenforceable, and dismissed action. Plaintiff appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Linn, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
assignee's motion to present its proofs first was not concession that competitors had met their threshold burden of showing intent to deceive;
 
district court clearly erred in relying on evidence showing, at best, that inventor and his lawyer knew that prior art was material, and inability of inventor and his lawyer to offer good faith explanation, as basis to infer deliberate decision to withhold prior art reference;
 
decision of district court to not credit testimony of inventor and his lawyer could not be used as affirmative evidence of selective disclosure; and
 
paying issue fee after prior art reference had been brought to their attention was not deliberate decision to withhold prior art reference.
 
Reversed.
