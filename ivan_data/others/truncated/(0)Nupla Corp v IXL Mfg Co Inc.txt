United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
NUPLA CORPORATION, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
IXL MANUFACTURING COMPANY, INC., Defendant-Appellee.
No. 96-1388.
|
May 12, 1997.
Synopsis
Licensee under reissue patent for flexible cores to be inserted into tool handles, which also owned trademark CUSH-N-GRIP for tool handles and replacement handle kits, brought action against competitor alleging patent and trademark infringement. The United States District Court for the Central District of California, Manuel L. Real, J., granted competitor's motions for partial summary judgment and dismissed complaint. Licensee appealed. The Court of Appeals, Michel, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) patent was invalid because declaration submitted with reissue application, which addressed only one of three material changes from original patent claims, was insufficient, and (2) CUSH-N-GRIP trademark was generic.
 
Affirmed.
