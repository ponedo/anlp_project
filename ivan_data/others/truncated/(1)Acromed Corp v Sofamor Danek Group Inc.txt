Synopsis
Patentee of improved surgical spinal plate and improved bone screw brought infringement action against competitor. After jury verdict that spinal plate patent was invalid for improper inventorship and that bone screw patent was valid, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Ann Aldrich, J., granted judgment as a matter of law that spinal plate patent was not invalid for improper inventorship. Competitor appealed. The Court of Appeals, Rader, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) evidence was insufficient to establish that engineer was inventor of spinal plate and bone screw; (2) evidence was insufficient to establish that engineer's cutting of recessed slots into spinal plate was inventive conception; (3) term "engage" in bone screw claim was properly construed as "fitting together"; (4) bone screw patent was not limited to screw with body portion of diameter at least as large as crest diameter of second externally threaded portion; and (5) evidence was insufficient to prove invalidation of bone screw patent by prior art.
 
Affirmed.
