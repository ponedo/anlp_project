Synopsis
Background: Owner of patent for electronic trading platform used in trading government securities sued competitor for infringement. Competitor counterclaimed that patent was unenforceable, and that suit was barred by laches. The United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Kent A. Jordan, J., 417 F.Supp.2d 580, found patent was unenforceable because of inequitable conduct, and entered final judgment in favor of competitor. Patent owner appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Moore, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
false statements in declarations submitted during prosecution, to disclose prior art and attempt to cure the earlier non-disclosure of this prior art, were material, and
 
finding that declarations were submitted with intent to deceive the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) was not clearly erroneous.
 
Affirmed.
