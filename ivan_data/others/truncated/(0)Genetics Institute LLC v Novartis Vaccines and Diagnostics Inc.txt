Rehearing En Banc Denied Nov. 9, 2011.
Synopsis
Background: Patentee of patent for recombinant human blood-clotting proteins brought interfering patents action against competitor to determine priority of invention. Competitor moved to dismiss for lack of interference. The United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Sue L. Robinson, J., 687 F.Supp.2d 486, granted motion. Patentee appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Lourie, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
expiration of patent following district court's judgment did not strip Court of Appeals of jurisdiction over patentee's appeal;
 
patent term extension was not limited to only particular claims of patent, but applied to patent as a whole; and
 
no interference in fact existed between patentee's asserted claims competitor's patents.
 
Affirmed.
 
Dyk, Circuit Judge, file an opinion concurring-in-part and dissenting-in-part.
