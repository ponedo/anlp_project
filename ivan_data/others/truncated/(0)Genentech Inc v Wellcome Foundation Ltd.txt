Synopsis
Action was filed alleging infringement of three patents describing glycoprotein tissue plasminogen activator and its production. Alleged infringers moved for judgment notwithstanding verdict in favor of patentee, or in alternative for new trial. The United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Joseph J. Farnan, Jr., J., denied motions and appeal was taken. The Court of Appeals, Plager, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) specific activity limitation appearing in claims for one patent meant specific activity as measured by using bovine fibrin plate assay; (2) considering prosecution history, specific activity of alleged infringing product did not as matter of law meet specific activity limitation appearing in claim, under doctrine of equivalents; and (3) human tissue plasminogen activator limitation appearing in two of the patents meant natural protein found only in patented product, and jury's implied conclusion that alleged infringing product met activator limitation appearing in patents under doctrine of equivalents was not supported by substantial evidence.
 
Reversed.
 
Lourie, Circuit Judge, concurred and filed opinion.
