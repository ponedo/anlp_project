United States Court of Appeals, Federal Circuit.
ZUP, LLC, Plaintiff-Appellant
v.
NASH MANUFACTURING, INC., Defendant-Appellee
2017-1601
|
Decided: July 25, 2018
Synopsis
Background: Owner of patent for water recreational device brought action against competitor, alleging contributory infringement, inducement of infringement, trade secret misappropriation, and breach of contract. Competitor counterclaimed, seeking declaration of non-infringement and invalidity. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, No. 3:16-cv-00125-HEH, Henry E. Hudson, J., 229 F.Supp.3d 430, ruled that patent was invalid for obviousness, and granted summary judgment in favor of competitor on non-patent claims. Owner appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Prost, Chief Judge, held that:
 
one of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to combine various elements of prior art in way claimed by patent;
 
District Court did not improperly shift burden to prove non-obviousness to owner; and
 
secondary considerations did not establish non-obviousness.
 
Affirmed.
 
Newman, Circuit Judge, filed dissenting opinion.
 
Procedural Posture(s): On Appeal; Motion for Summary Judgment.
*1367 Appeal from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia in No. 3:16-cv-00125-HEH, Judge Henry E. Hudson.
