Synopsis
Patentee brought action against competitor, alleging infringement of its patent concerning variable capacitance displacement sensors for use in inclinometers to measure degree of inclination or tilt. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Leonie M. Brinkema, J., granted summary judgment of noninfringement in favor of competitor, 1995 WL 799588, and patentee appealed. The Court of Appeals, Lourie, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) for purposes of patent concerning variable capacitance displacement sensors, term "conductive" in claim describing "conductive liquid-like medium" was not limited to conductivity levels inherent in examples disclosed in specification; (2) statements made in Information Disclosure Statement (IDS) can be basis for court to interpret scope of claims of granted patent; (3) to extent patent applicant distinguishes claimed invention over prior art, arguments in IDS can create estoppel, and thus preclude finding of infringement under doctrine of equivalents; and (4) genuine issue of material fact as to whether accused device used its liquid as dielectric or as capacitor plate precluded summary judgment.
 
Vacated and remanded.
