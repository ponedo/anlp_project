Background: Patentee brought an infringement action against a competitor, alleging that the competitor's processes for manufacturing drugs for treatment of hypertension infringed on its patent for the manufacture of stable moexipril magnesium tablets for the treatment of high blood pressure. The United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Donald M. Middlebrooks, J., 970 F.Supp.2d 1297, found for the competitor in a bench trial. The patentee appealed.

the inventor affirmatively misrepresented material facts regarding prior art during the prosecution of the patent, and
 
the inventor intended to deceive the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) during the prosecution of the patent.
