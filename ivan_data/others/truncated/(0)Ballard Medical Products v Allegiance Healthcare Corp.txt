DECIDED: Oct. 9, 2001.
Synopsis
Patentee brought action against maker of accused device, alleging infringement of patents drawn to ventilating and aspirating tracheobronchial catheters. The United States District Court for the District of Utah, Bruce S. Jenkins, J., granted summary judgment of noninfringement, and patentee appealed. The Court of Appeals, Bryson, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) district court's reference to prosecution history estoppel in connection with literal infringement claim did not warrant reversal; (2) valve limitation in patents was limited to vacuum valves with a static internal seal; and (3) patent was not infringed.
 
Affirmed.
