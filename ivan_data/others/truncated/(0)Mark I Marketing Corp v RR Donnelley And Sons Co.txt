Synopsis
Patentee for color printing method using two colors of ink brought infringement action against defendant producer of telephone directories. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, George W. Lindberg, J., granted summary judgment for defendant, and patentee appealed. The Court of Appeals, Lourie, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) patentee was estopped by prosecution history from asserting infringement by any process that did not involve sequential interposition of colored filters, and (2) defendant's method did not infringe patent.
 
Affirmed.
