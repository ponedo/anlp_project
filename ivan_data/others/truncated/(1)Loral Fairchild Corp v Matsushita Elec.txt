Synopsis
Patentee brought action against alleged infringers relating to patent on process for manufacturing a charge coupled device. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Randall R. Rader, J., sitting by designation, granted judgment of invalidity based on obviousness. Patentee appealed. The Court of Appeals, Michel, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) fact issue existed precluding summary judgment, and (2) patent holder presented corroborating evidence that it began production efforts using claimed process.
 
Reversed and remanded.
 
Pauline Newman, Circuit Judge, filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.
