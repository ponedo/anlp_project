United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
STRECK, INC., Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
RESEARCH & DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEMS, INC. and Techne Corporation, Defendants-Appellants.
No. 2011-1044.

Jan. 10, 2012.
Synopsis
Background: Patentee brought action for alleged infringement of three patents for hematology control technology. Competitor counterclaimed for declaratory judgment of noninfringement and invalidity. After construing patent claims, 2008 WL 4891132, the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska, Joseph F. Bataillon, Chief Judge, 658 F.Supp.2d 988, granted partial summary judgment for patentee, and, after granting judgment as a matter of law for patentee on enablement, 2010 WL 3926059,denied competitor's renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law and motion for new trial, and, finally, issued permanent injunction. Competitor appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, O'Malley, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
district court lacked jurisdiction over counterclaim seeking declaratory judgment of invalidity as to patent claims not included by patentee in its infringement allegations;
 
patents provided adequate written description for integrated controls using either true reticulocytes or reticulocyte analogs;
 
patents enabled claimed integrated hematology control using both true reticulocytes and reticulocyte analogs;
 
priority determination by Court of Appeals in companion appeal rendered moot competitor's arguments on appeal related to priority issue; and
 
permanent injunction was not overbroad.
 
Affirmed.
