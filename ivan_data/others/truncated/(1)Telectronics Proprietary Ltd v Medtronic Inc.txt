Synopsis
Client brought action seeking declaration of patent invalidity, unenforceability, and noninfringement, and assignee counterclaimed for infringement. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Peter K. Leisure, J., held that client's attorneys were not required to be disqualified, and assignee filed interlocutory appeal. The Court of Appeals, Bissell, Circuit Judge, held that attorneys who participated in original prosecution of patent were not disqualified under Code of Professional Responsibility from representing interests seeking to invalidate patent, where patent had been assigned to patentee who was not client of attorneys, proof of invalidity of patent was limited to prior art that was not known at time that application was prosecuted, and there was no showing that attorneys obtained actual confidences that would give their present client unfair advantage.
 
Affirmed.
