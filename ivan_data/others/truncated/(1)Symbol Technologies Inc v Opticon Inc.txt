Rehearing Denied Sept. 6, 1991.
Synopsis
Holder of patents for laser bar code scanners brought suit alleging that bar code scanning devices were infringing, and alleged infringer filed counterclaim for declaratory judgment that two patents were invalid and unenforceable. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Kimba M. Wood, J., concluded that patents were not proven invalid or unenforceable and found infringement. Alleged infringer appealed. The Court of Appeals, Clevenger, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) laser bar code scanner patents using "aim and shoot" feature and using repetitive self-scanning of bar code symbol until it is decoded were not shown to be invalid for obviousness, although prior art included portable laser scanning head which detected and decoded laser beams reflected from bar codes and erroneously excluded prior art reference disclosed laser scanning head for reading bar code symbols that had trigger, and (2) patent for laser bar code scanning device with "aim and shoot" feature was not available as reference against divisional patent which included "aim and shoot" feature but also additional features including means for repetitively self-scanning bar code symbol until it was decoded and termination of repetitive scan if no successful decode were achieved, so the divisional patent application was not invalid for obviousness-type double patenting.
 
Affirmed.
