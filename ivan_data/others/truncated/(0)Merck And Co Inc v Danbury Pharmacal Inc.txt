v.

Synopsis
Patent infringement action was brought. The patent was held unenforceable by the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Murray M. Schwartz, Chief Judge, 694 F.Supp. 1, and patent holder appealed. The Court of Appeals, Markey, Chief Judge, held that the patent for method of using drug as muscle relaxant was unenforceable because of inequitable conduct in its procurement, both in withholding material prior art and in misrepresenting that drug was free of side effects ordinarily associated with nervous system depressants.
 
Affirmed.
