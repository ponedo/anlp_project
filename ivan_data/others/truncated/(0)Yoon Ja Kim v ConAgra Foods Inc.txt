465 F.3d 1312
United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
YOON JA KIM, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
CONAGRA FOODS, INC., Defendant-Cross Appellant.
Nos. 05-1414, 05-1420.

Sept. 20, 2006.

Rehearing Denied Oct. 17, 2006.
Synopsis
Background: Holder of patent related to breadmaking sued competitor for infringement. Competitor filed counterclaim for declaratory judgment of invalidity and noninfringement of patent. Following jury verdict, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, William T. Hart, Senior Judge, 2005 WL 1311597, granted in part and denied in part competitor's motion for judgment as a matter of law (JMOL), and entered final judgment finding patent was not infringed and not invalid. Patent holder appealed, and competitor cross-appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Dyk, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
phrase "potassium bromate replacer composition" meant potassium bromate substitute;
 
expert's conclusory testimony that additional ingredients in accused products would not have materially affected pertinent characteristics of bread was insufficient to establish infringement;
 
substantial evidence supported verdict of noninfringement; and
 
during prosecution of original patent related to breadmaking, patent holder did not surrender disputed claims.
 
Affirmed.
 
Schall, Circuit Judge, filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.
