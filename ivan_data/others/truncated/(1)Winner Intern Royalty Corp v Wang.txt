Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc Denied March 6, 2000.
Synopsis
Owner of patent and patent application claiming automobile anti-theft device brought action challenging decision of the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences, in interference proceeding, declaring patent and application claims invalid as obvious. Competitor's motion to transfer action to California was denied, 1998 WL 268279. Following bench trial, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, Stanley Sporkin, J., 11 F.Supp.2d 18, overturned Board's decision, and competitor appealed. The Court of Appeals, Michel, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) owner's submission to district court of live testimony on all matters before the Board required court to conduct trial de novo; (2) patent was not invalid as obvious; (3) allowing allegedly late-disclosed witnesses to testify was not abuse of discretion; (4) evidence regarding nexus between commercial success of claimed invention and patentably distinct feature of invention was admissible; and (5) competitor was not entitled to transfer.
 
Affirmed.
