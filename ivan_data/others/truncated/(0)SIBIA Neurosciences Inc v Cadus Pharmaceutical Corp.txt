United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
SIBIA NEUROSCIENCES, INC., Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
CADUS PHARMACEUTICAL CORPORATION, Defendant-Appellant.
No. 99-1381.
|
Sept. 6, 2000.
Synopsis
Patentee brought suit against competitor, alleging infringement of patent for method of identifying compounds that modulate cell surface protein-mediated activity by detecting intracellular transduction of a signal generated upon interaction of the compound with the cell surface protein. The United States District Court for the Southern District of California, Irma E. Gonzales, J., denied competitor's motion for judgment as a matter of law (JMOL), and entered judgment on jury verdict for patentee. Competitor appealed. The Court of Appeals, Gajarsa, Circuit Judge, held that patent was obvious, in light of express teachings in prior art which provided motivation and suggestion to modify existing techniques to arrive at method in question, and thus was invalid.
 
Reversed.
 
Mayer, Chief Judge, dissented and filed opinion.
