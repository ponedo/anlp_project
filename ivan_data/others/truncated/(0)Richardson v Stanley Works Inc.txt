Rehearing En Banc Denied May 24, 2010.
Synopsis
Background: Patent owner filed action against competitor, alleging infringement of design patent for multi-function carpentry tool that combined conventional hammer with stud climbing tool and crowbar. Following bench trial, the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, Neil V. Wake, J., 610 F.Supp.2d 1046, entered judgment for competitor. Owner appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Lourie, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
in its claim construction, district court properly factored out functional aspects of the design;
 
patent was not infringed; and
 
owner's jury demand was untimely.
 
Affirmed.
