Synopsis
Background: Patentee which marketed a platelet aggregation inhibiting agent used to reduce thrombotic events such as heart attacks and strokes brought infringement action against competitor, which had filed Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) seeking approval to manufacture and sell generic version of agent's active ingredient, clopidogrel bisulfate. Competitor counterclaimed, alleging that patent was invalid and unenforceable. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Sidney H. Stein, J., 2006 WL 2516486,granted preliminary injunction for patentee, and competitor appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Lourie, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
patentee was likely to succeed in its defense against competitor's challenge to validity of patent based on alleged anticipation;
 
patentee was likely to succeed in its defense against competitor's obviousness challenge to patent;
 
patentee was likely to succeed in its defense against competitor's challenge to enforceability of patent;
 
patentee's entry of settlement agreement with competitor did not contract away patentee's right to prove irreparable harm;
 
balance of hardships tipped in patentee's favor;
 
public interest supported injunction;
 
competitor was not entitled to assert claim of unclean hands in opposition to patentee's request for preliminary injunction; and
 
injunction bond in amount of $400 million was adequate.
