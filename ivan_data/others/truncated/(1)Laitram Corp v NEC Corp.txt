Synopsis
In patent infringement action, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, A.J. McNamara, J., granted partial summary judgment in favor of defendant, and order was certified for immediate appeal. The Court of Appeals, Pauline Newman, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) amendments made to patent claims during reexamination are not per se substantive when the amendments are made following rejection based on prior art, and (2) material factual premises underlying interpretation of amendments made to patent claims during reexamination following rejection based on prior art were in genuine dispute, precluding summary judgment.
 
Reversed and remanded.
