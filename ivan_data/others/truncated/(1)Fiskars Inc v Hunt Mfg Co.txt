Synopsis
Patentee brought action for infringement of patent for paper cutter with circular blades. The United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin, Barbara B. Crabb, J., entered judgment on jury verdict of infringement. Alleged infringer appealed. The Court of Appeals, Pauline Newman, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) evidence supported finding that patent was infringed under doctrine of equivalents; (2) patentee did not engage in inequitable conduct in patent prosecution; and (3) infringer could be sanctioned for pursuing baseless claim of inequitable conduct.
 
Affirmed.
