Synopsis
In a patent infringement suit, the United States District Court for the District of New York, 587 F.Supp. 1495, Kevin Thomas Duffy, J., granted summary judgment on defendants' counterclaim alleging that plaintiff's reissue patent no. 31,144 for a multistation telephone switching system was invalid, and plaintiff appealed. The Court of Appeals, Pauline Newman, Circuit Judge, held that defendant failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that claims contained in reissue patent no. 31,144 for a multistation telephone switching system were invalid for obviousness.
