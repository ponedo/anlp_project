140 F.3d 1009
United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
DAWN EQUIPMENT COMPANY, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
KENTUCKY FARMS INCORPORATED, Defendant-Appellant.
No. 97-1042.
|
March 24, 1998.
Synopsis
Patentee brought action alleging infringement of patent on device for adjusting height of farm implements. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Philip G. Reinhard, J., entered judgment upon jury verdict for patentee, finding infringement under doctrine of equivalents, and denied defendant's motion for judgment as matter of law. Defendant appealed. The Court of Appeals, Plager, Circuit Judge, held that accused device, which had multiple-hole, pinned height-adjustment mechanism, did not infringe, under doctrine of equivalents, patent's locking and releasing means with structure that included rotatable shaft, pin, and slot.
