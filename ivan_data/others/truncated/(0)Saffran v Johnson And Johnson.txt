Rehearing En Banc Denied July 1, 2013.
Synopsis
Background: Patent owner filed action against competitor alleging infringement of patent on medical device directed toward treatment of damaged tissue. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, T. John Ward, J., 740 F.Supp.2d 899, construed claims, and, after jury verdict in patent owner's favor, 2011 WL 1299607, awarded damages, and, 2011 WL 1306420,denied competitor's motion for judgment as matter of law. Competitor appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Lourie, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
term "device" meant a continuous sheet and excluded stents having open mesh holes;
 
function of "means for release of at least one treating material in a directional manner" was to release a drug preferentially toward the damaged tissue;
 
structure corresponding to function of releasing drug preferentially toward damaged tissue was hydrolyzable bonds; and
 
competitor's medical stents, which both lacked a sheet covering the open mesh holes between their struts and lacked a drug affixed to their surfaces via hydrolyzable bonds, did not infringe upon patent.
 
Reversed.
 
Moore, Circuit Judge, filed opinion concurring in part.
 
O'Malley, Circuit Judge, filed opinion concurring in part.
