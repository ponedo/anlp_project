Synopsis
Background: Patentee brought infringement action against alleged infringers, claiming infringement of patent relating to the use of a high level programming language with a microcontroller. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Leonard Davis, J., 2012 WL 2505745, construed terms and granted summary judgment to the alleged infringers. The patentee appealed.
 
Holdings: The United States Court of Appeals, Dyk, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
term "memory" meant all program memory;
 
term "programmable device" meant a single semiconductor substrate integrating electronic circuit components that includes a central processing unit and all program memory making it suitable for use as an embedded system; and
 
patentee failed to establish infringement under doctrine of equivalents.
 
Affirmed.
