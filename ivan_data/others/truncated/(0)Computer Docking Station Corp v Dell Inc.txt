Synopsis
Background: Patent owner brought action against competitors alleging infringement of patent claiming portable microprocessor system with sufficient processing power, memory, and network compatibility for business applications. The United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin, Barbara B. Crabb, Chief Judge, granted judgment for competitors. Owner appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Rader, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
terms "portable computer" and "portable computer microprocessing system" limited scope of asserted claims;
 
term, "portable," meant capable of being moved about;
 
phrases, "portable computer" and "portable computer microprocessing system," excluded computers with built-in displays or keyboards;
 
examiner's citation of single connection limitation in reasons for allowability did not erase applicants' clear disavowal of laptops during prosecution;
 
applicants' clear disavowal of laptops in prosecution history, based on evidence of pre-filing activities in record, did not mean that infringement action was objectively baseless; and
 
owner's decision to continue infringement litigation after district court's adverse claim construction did not make case exceptional.
 
Affirmed.
