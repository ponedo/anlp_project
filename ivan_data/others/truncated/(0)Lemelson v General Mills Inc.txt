Synopsis
Patent infringement suit was filed against toy company alleging that its "Hot Wheels" toy car track infringed plaintiff's toy track. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Charles P. Kocoras, J., entered judgment on jury verdict in favor of plaintiff and denied defendant's motion for judgment notwithstanding verdict or for new trial. Defendant appealed. The Court of Appeals, Plager, Circuit Judge, held that Mattel's "Hot Wheels" toy car track could not be found to meet all limitations contained in allegedly infringed patent either literally or by equivalents absent sufficient evidence that track was distinguishable from prior art.
 
Reversed.
