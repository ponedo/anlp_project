Decided: September 7, 2017
Synopsis
Background: Patentee brought infringement action against competitor, alleging infringement of resealable cookie package. Competitor asserted defenses of unenforceability and invalidity. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, No. 1:13-cv-00321, Matthew F. Kennelly, J., 118 F.Supp.3d 1022, granted summary judgment for competitor regarding invalidity and against competitor regarding unenforceability. Parties appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Taranto, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
skilled artisan would have had motivation to use pull-back resealable package for discrete food items with rigid tray, as disclosed in prior art article, that was usable for variety of foods "such as" discrete items like sushi and canapes to resolve known problem of insufficiently convenient opening and reclosing arrangement for cookie packaging to be accessed from top;
 
expert testimony was not required to conclude that patent was obvious; and
 
reasonable inference that patentee knew during reexamination that critical statement in prior art article was misprint was not sufficient to permit finding of intent required for inequitable conduct.
 
Affirmed.
 
Reyna, Circuit Judge, filed opinion dissenting-in-part.
 
*1338 Appeals from the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in No. 1:13-cv-00321, Judge Matthew F. Kennelly.
