Synopsis
Owner of patents for method of, and device for, making properly balanced, injected-molded fans brought infringement action against manufacturer of radiator and condenser assemblies. After jury found that patents were valid and awarded damages for infringement, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Blanche M. Manning, J., denied manufacturer's motion for judgment as a matter of law or new trial, and manufacturer appealed. The Court of Appeals, Mayer, Chief Judge, held that: (1) whether patents were invalid under statutory on-sale bar was question for jury; (2) whether patents were invalid for obviousness was question for jury; and (3) owner was entitled to damages under entire market value rule.
 
Affirmed.
