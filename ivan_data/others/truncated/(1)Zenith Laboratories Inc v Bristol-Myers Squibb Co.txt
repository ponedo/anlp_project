Synopsis
Seller of antibiotic that allegedly converted into infringing crystal after ingested by patient brought declaratory judgment suit against owner of patent for antibiotic crystal developed to assist in preingestation encapsulation. The United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, Alfred M. Wolin, J., ruled that seller induced infringement following bench trial. Appeal was taken. The Court of Appeals, Plager, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) prosecution history did not limit patent claim to drug's preingested form; (2) absence of evidence comparing alleged infringing drug after ingestation with patented drug precluded finding that seller induced infringement; and (3) doctrine of equivalents did not apply as matter of law.
 
Reversed.
