United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
AVID IDENTIFICATION SYSTEMS, INC., Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
The CRYSTAL IMPORT CORPORATION, Datamars SA and Datamars, Inc., Defendants.
Nos. 2009-1216, 2009-1254.

Synopsis
Background: Assignee of patent directed to a multi-mode radio-frequency identification system for reading encoded biocompatible chips brought action against competitor, alleging infringement, as well as unfair competition and false advertising. After a jury found in favor of assignee, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, T. John Ward, J., granted competitor's motion to hold the patent unenforceable for inequitable conduct, 2007 WL 2901415, and, subsequently, dismissed assignee's unopposed motion for reconsideration. Assignee appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Prost, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
live controversy remained between the parties;
 
district court's finding that trade show demonstration was material prior art was not clearly erroneous; and
 
district court's finding that patent assignee's president owed duty of candor was not clearly erroneous.
 
Affirmed.
 
Linn, Circuit Judge, filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.
