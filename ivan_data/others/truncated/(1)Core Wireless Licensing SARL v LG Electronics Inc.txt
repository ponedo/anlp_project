Decided: January 25, 2018
Synopsis
Background: Patentee brought action against competitor, alleging infringement of patents disclosing improved display interfaces, particularly for electronic devices with small screens like mobile telephones. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Nos. 2:14-cv-00911-JRG-RSP, 2:14-cv-00912-JRG-SP, J. Rodney Gilstrap, J., 2016 WL 1106438, denied summary judgment that claims of patents were directed to patent ineligible subject matter, and denied judgment as matter of law that claims were not infringed, 2016 WL 4440255, after jury found all asserted claims infringed and not invalid. Competitor appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Moore, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
claims in patents were not directed to abstract idea of index;
 
reasonable jury could have concluded that claims in patents on improved user interface for computing devices were not anticipated by prior art;
 
term, "un-launched state," meant "not displayed";
 
patentee did not clearly and unmistakably disclaim or limit construction of "unlaunched state" during prosecution;
 
substantial evidence supported jury's verdict of infringement.
 
Affirmed.
 
Wallach, Circuit Judge, filed opinion concurring-in-part and dissenting-in-part.
 
Procedural Posture(s): On Appeal; Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law (JMOL)/Directed Verdict; Motion for Summary Judgment.
*1357 Appeals from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas in Nos. 2:14-cv-00911-JRG-RSP, 2:14-cv-00912-JRG-SP, Judge J. Rodney Gilstrap.
