United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
LEAPFROG ENTERPRISES, INC., Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
FISHER-PRICE, INC. and Mattel, Inc., Defendants-Appellees.
No. 06-1402.
|
May 9, 2007.
Synopsis
Background: Patent holder brought action against competitor alleging infringement of patent directed toward interactive learning device. The United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Gregory M. Sleet, J., 2006 WL 891001, entered judgment of noninfringement and invalidity. Patent holder appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Lourie, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
accused device could not practice "selection of a depicted letter";
 
claim was invalid as obvious; and
 
substantial evidence of commercial success, praise, and long-felt need was inadequate to overcome final conclusion that claim in patent would have been obvious given strength of prima facie obviousness showing.
 
Affirmed.
