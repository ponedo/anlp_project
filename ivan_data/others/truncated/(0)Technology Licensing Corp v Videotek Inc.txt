United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
TECHNOLOGY LICENSING CORPORATION, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
VIDEOTEK, INC., Defendant,
and
Gennum Corporation, Defendant-Cross Appellant.
Nos. 2007-1441, 2007-1463.

Synopsis
Background: Patent owner filed action against competitor alleging infringement of patents relating to separation of synchronization signals from video signals. Parties consented to final disposition by magistrate judge. The United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Richard Seeborg, United States Magistrate Judge, determined that one patent claim was indefinite for failure to satisfy written description requirement, and that other patent had not been infringed but was not invalid. Parties appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Plager, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
judicial efficiency and policy of repose counseled against according deference on appeal to re-determination of patent validity by Patent and Trademark Office (PTO), which acted on reissue application while appeal was pending;
 
"other circuit" claim was not entitled to benefit of original filing date of patent application for failure to satisfy written description requirement;
 
accused sync separator chips were not designed to, and did not produce in practice, claimed "clamped sync portion" at known level of fixed voltage;
 
anticipatory prior art that was cumulative to other prior art of record in patent application was not material for inequitable conduct purposes;
 
claim was not automatically indefinite due to absence of internal circuitry in written description; and
 
competitor did not carry its burden to prove claim was indefinite, and thus invalid, due to absence of internal circuitry in written description.
 
Affirmed.
