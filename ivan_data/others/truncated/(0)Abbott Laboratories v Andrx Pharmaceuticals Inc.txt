Synopsis
Background: Patentee brought action alleging infringement of its patents relating to extended release formulations of clarithromycin. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, David H. Coar, J., 2005 WL 1323435,granted patentee's motion for a preliminary injunction, and defendant appealed.
 
The Court of Appeals, Prost, Circuit Judge, held that accused infringer raised substantial questions concerning validity, on grounds of obviousness, of patent claims, and therefore patentee failed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits.
 
Vacated.
 
Newman, Circuit Judge, filed dissenting opinion.
