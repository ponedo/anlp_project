Rehearing En Banc Denied Feb. 12, 2008.*
Synopsis
Background: Patent owner brought action against competitor alleging infringement of patent for microfiltration of liquids in relatively large systems. The United States District Court for the Southern District of California, Rudi M. Brewster, Senior District Judge, granted judgment for owner. Competitor appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Lourie, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
grandparent patent anticipated, and thereby invalidated, grandchild patent due to lack of continuity of disclosure in family chain, and
 
question of whether intervening patents maintained continuity of disclosure by incorporating gas distribution system by reference that had been disclosed in grandparent patent, entitling grandchild patent to earlier filing date, was question of law subject to de novo review.
 
Reversed.
 
Newman, Circuit Judge, filed dissenting opinion.
