Synopsis
Patentee brought suit alleging infringement of its patent for sectional sofa in which control means for reclining seats were contained in fixed console separating seats had established. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi, Glen H. Davidson, Chief Judge, initially denied competitors' motion for summary judgment, 27 F.Supp.2d 686, and subsequently entered judgment that patent was not enforceable due to inequitable conduct, 88 F.Supp.2d 619. Patentee appealed. The Court of Appeals, Mayer, Chief Judge, held that: (1) testimony of patentee's counsel in earlier litigation resulted in waiver of attorney-client privilege, and (2) determination that patentee had engaged in inequitable conduct by intentionally failing to disclose material references during patent application process was within district court's discretion.
 
Affirmed.
