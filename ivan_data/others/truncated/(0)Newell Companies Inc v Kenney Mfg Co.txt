Synopsis
Holder of patent on adjustable window shades appealed from order of the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island, Francis J. Boyle, Chief Judge, 606 F.Supp. 1282, which granted alleged infringer's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the issue of obviousness. The Court of Appeals, Nies, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) where the only issue is the application of the statutory standard of obviousness to an established set of facts, there is only a question of law to be resolved by the trial judge, and (2) patent was invalid for obviousness.
 
Affirmed.
 
Pauline Newman, Circuit Judge, filed a dissenting opinion.
