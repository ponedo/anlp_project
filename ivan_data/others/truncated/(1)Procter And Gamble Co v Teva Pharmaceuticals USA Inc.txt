United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
The PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY, Plaintiff-Appellee,

Synopsis
Background: Owner of patent claiming compound risedronate, the active ingredient of an osteoporosis drug, brought infringement action against competitor. The United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Joseph J. Farnan, Jr., J., 536 F.Supp.2d 476, in a bench trial, entered judgment in favor of patent owner. Competitor appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Huff, District Judge, sitting by designation, held that:
 
district court did not clearly err in finding that competitor failed to establish prima facie case of obviousness;
 
district court did not commit clear error in concluding that secondary considerations supported a finding of non-obviousness of patent claiming risedronate;
 
patent claiming an intermittent dosing method for treating osteoporosis qualified as prior art; and
 
patent claiming risedronate was not invalid based on obviousness-type double patenting.
 
Affirmed.
