874 F.3d 1316
United States Court of Appeals, Federal Circuit.
BAYER PHARMA AG, Bayer Intellectual Property GmbH, Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Plaintiffs-Appellees
v.
WATSON LABORATORIES, INC., Actavis Pharma, Inc., Defendants-Appellants
2016-2169
|
Decided: November 1, 2017
Synopsis
Background: Patentee brought action against competitor for infringement of patent for erectile disfunction (ED) drug in the form of an oral disintegrating tablet (ODT). Competitor filed counterclaim, alleging patent was invalid for obviousness. Following bench trial, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Gregory M. Sleet, J., 183 F.Supp.3d 538, found patent valid. Competitor appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Moore, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
district court clearly erred in finding that there was no motivation to formulate ED drug as an ODT formulation;
 
district court clearly erred in finding that a person of ordinary skill in the art would not have been motivated to formulate ED drug in an ODT using sorbitol and mannitol;
 
district court erred in determining that the expected bitter taste and increased bioavailability of immediate-release ODT formulation of ED drug would have taught away from an immediate-release formulation of drug; and
 
patent for immediate-release formulation of ODT version of ED drug was invalid for obviousness.
 
Reversed.
