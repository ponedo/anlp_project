175 F.3d 974
United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
STREAMFEEDER, LLC, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
SURE-FEED SYSTEMS, INC. and Mailing Machine Service, Inc., Defendants-Appellants.
No. 98-1521.
|
April 20, 1999.
Synopsis
Assignee of patent for bottom sheet feeder brought action against competitor, alleging infringement of patent under the doctrine of equivalents. The United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, Richard H. Kyle, J., entered judgment upon jury verdict finding infringement and denied competitor's motion for judgment as a matter of law or a new trial. Competitor appealed. The Court of Appeals, Lourie, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) hypothetical claim adopted by district court was improper and, because permissible hypothetical claim read on prior art, patent was not infringed, and (2) assignee could not assert infringement of dependent claims.
 
Reversed.
