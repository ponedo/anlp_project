Synopsis
Licensee of clipless bicycle pedal and cleat patents sued manufacturer of competing clipless pedal system for patent and trade dress infringement, and defendant counterclaimed, seeking declaration that patents were invalid. The United States District Court for the Southern District of California, James F. Stiven, J., found that patents were enforceable, but that there was no infringement. Cross-appeals were filed. The Court of Appeals, Bryson, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) licensee had standing to bring infringement action in its own name; (2) defendant's pedals were neither literally nor equivalently infringing; (3) defendant's cleats were not infringing; (4) plaintiff's trade dress was not infringed; (5) patents were not unenforceable due to failure to disclose prior art; and (6) defendant was not entitled to attorney fees.
 
Affirmed.
