Synopsis
Licensee brought suit for declaration of noninfringement, invalidity, and unenforceability as to patents relating to decaffeinated coffee. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Gerard L. Goettel, J., 765 F.Supp. 121, entered judgment declaring claims of patent invalid on ground of double patenting. Patent holder appealed. The Court of Appeals, Rich, Circuit Judge, held that claims of patent describing process for decaffeination of coffee were not invalid on ground of double patenting of claims in earlier-issued patent for process of recovering caffeine for decaffeinated coffee, since the two patents did not claim the same invention, and neither claimed process was a mere obvious variation of the other.
 
Reversed and remanded.
