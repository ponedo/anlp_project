Synopsis
Assignee of patent for cough and cold medication brought infringement action against competitors, and competitors counterclaimed, alleging that patent was invalid and not infringed and that intervening rights barred recovery. After assignee's motion for judgment as matter of law on infringement issue was granted, jury entered verdict in favor of assignee. The United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Sue L. Robinson, J., 1996 WL 31209, entered judgment as matter of law for competitors, on grounds of obviousness and prior invention. Assignee appealed. The Court of Appeals, Plager, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) Court of Appeals would not merely apply same standard as district court on appeal from grant of judgment as matter of law, and (2) claim for medication comprising ibuprofen and pseudoephedrine in combinatory immixture was invalid for obviousness.
 
Affirmed.
