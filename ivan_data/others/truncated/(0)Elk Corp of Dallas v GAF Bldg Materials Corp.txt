Synopsis
Manufacturer of roofing shingles brought action against competitors, alleging infringement of design patent. Competitors counterclaimed, alleging that patent was unenforceable due to inequitable conduct. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Jorge A. Solis, J., held patent unenforceable, and manufacturer appealed. The Court of Appeals, Plager, Circuit Judge, held that manufacturer's failure to disclose to Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) two prior art patents was inequitable conduct that rendered patent unenforceable.
 
Affirmed.
