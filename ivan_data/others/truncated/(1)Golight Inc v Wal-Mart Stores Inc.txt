Synopsis
Background: Owner of patent for remote controlled portable searchlight sued retail store for infringement. The United States District Court for the District of Colorado, 216 F.Supp.2d 1175, Zita L. Weinshienk, Senior District Judge, found that patent was valid and infringed. Store appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Prost, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
patent did not require that light had to be rotatable through full 360Â°;
 
patent was not invalid as obvious;
 
evidence supported damage award;
 
evidence supported finding that infringement was willful; and
 
award of attorney fees was not abuse of discretion.
 
Affirmed.
 
Archer, Senior Circuit Judge, dissented in part and filed opinion.
