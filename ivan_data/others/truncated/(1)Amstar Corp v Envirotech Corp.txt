730 F.2d 1476
United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
AMSTAR CORPORATION, Plaintiff/Appellant,
v.
ENVIROTECH CORPORATION and Energy Fuels Nuclear, Inc., Defendants/Appellees.
Appeal No. 83-1090.
|
March 27, 1984.
Synopsis
Suit was brought charging infringement of process and apparatus designed to enable industrial enterprises to separate solids from a large volume of liquid. The United States District Court for the District of Utah, Bruce S. Jenkins, J., held that, although the patent was valid and enforceable, it was not infringed. Patent holder appealed. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, Markey, Chief Judge, held that: (1) patent was infringed, notwithstanding claim that infringement was avoided because infringer added mechanical premixing to the apparatus, and (2) because infringer's brief relied on reverse statement of law of infringement, ignored numerous and unanimous contrary authorities, distorted a quotation, and presented an estoppel argument based on that distortion, infringer would be required to pay patent holder an amount double holder's costs on appeal.
 
Reversed and remanded.
 
Davis, Circuit Judge, concurred and dissented with statement.
