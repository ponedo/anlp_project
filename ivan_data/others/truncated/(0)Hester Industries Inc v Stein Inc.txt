Synopsis
Patentee brought action for infringement of reissue patents covering steam cookers. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Ellis, J., 963 F.Supp. 1403, granted summary judgment for alleged infringer, on grounds of invalidity. Patentee appealed, and alleged infringer cross-appealed, challenging district court's claim construction. The Court of Appeals, Plager, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) reissue claims violated recapture rule, due to arguments made during patent prosecution, and thus failed to satisfy reissue statute's "error" requirement; (2) requirement that reissue patent be "for the invention disclosed in the original patent" did not require objective intent, manifested in original patent, to claim invention as claimed in reissue patent; and (3) challenge to claim construction was moot.
 
Affirmed.
