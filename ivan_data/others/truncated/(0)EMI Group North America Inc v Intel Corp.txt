Synopsis
Patentee brought infringement action against competitor, claiming infringement of its patent for an improved method of fabricating metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) field effect transistors in a large scale integrated circuit. The United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Roderick R. McKelvie, J., 928 F.Supp. 449, 936 F.Supp. 1186,granted summary judgment in favor of competitor. Patentee appealed, and competitor cross-appealed, challenging ruling that competitor was not licensed under patent. The Court of Appeals, Pauline Newman, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) claim at issue was properly construed by district court; (2) patent was not literally infringed; and (3) patent was not infringed under doctrine of equivalents.
 
Affirmed and cross-appeal dismissed.
