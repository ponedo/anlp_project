Synopsis
Patentee brought action against competitor, alleging that its patent for resistor assembly was infringed by the competitor's Vehicle Anti-Theft System (VATS) keys. The United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Lynn N. Hughes, J., entered judgment in favor of patentee and awarded patentee attorney fees. Competitor appealed. The Court of Appeals, Rich, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) patent was not literally infringed; (2) patent was not infringed under doctrine of equivalents; and (3) case was not exceptional, as required to support attorney fee award.
