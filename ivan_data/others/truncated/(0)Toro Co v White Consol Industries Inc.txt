No. 98-1334.

Dec. 10, 1999.
Synopsis
Patentee brought action against competitor alleging infringement of patent for hand-held convertible vacuum/blower. The United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, David S. Doty, J., granted summary judgment finding infringement, and competitor appealed. The Court of Appeals, Pauline Newman, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) phrase "attachment means for removably securing said inlet air cover to said housing" did not require that cover be entirely separated from housing, and (2) phrase "cover including means for increasing the pressure" required device's restriction ring to be permanently affixed to and included as part of the cover.
 
Reversed and remanded.
 
Rader, Circuit Judge, filed dissenting opinion.
