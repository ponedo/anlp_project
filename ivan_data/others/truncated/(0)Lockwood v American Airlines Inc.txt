107 F.3d 1565
United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
Lawrence B. LOCKWOOD, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
AMERICAN AIRLINES, INC., Defendant-Appellee.
No. 96-1168.
|
March 4, 1997.
Synopsis
Holder of patents for computerized system of tailoring sales presentations to travel agents' customers brought action against airline, claiming that airline's computerized reservation system was infringing. The United States District Court for Southern District of California, William B. Enright, J., held that patents were invalid and not infringed, 877 F.Supp. 500, 834 F.Supp. 1246, and patent holder appealed. The Court of Appeals, Lourie, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) one patent was invalid in light of prior art; (2) patent claim required device with compact physical dimensions that could be easily transported; (3) patent required device that could produce audio-visual presentation; (4) "customer" within meaning of patent did not include travel agents; and (5) prosecution history precluded finding of infringement under doctrine of equivalents.
 
Affirmed.
