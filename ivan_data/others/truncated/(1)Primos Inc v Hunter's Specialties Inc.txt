Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc Denied Aug. 2, 2006.
Synopsis
Background: Patent holder brought infringement action against competitor over patents that disclosed diaphragm mouth call that hunters used to simulate animal sounds. Parties consented to final disposition by magistrate judge. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Iowa, John A. Jarvey, Chief United States Magistrate Judge, granted judgment for patent holder after jury verdict in its favor. Competitor appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Lourie, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
term "engaging" meant to come into contact with;
 
amendment to term "plate," to require it to have "length," did not narrow scope of claim;
 
amendment to term "plate," which required plate to be "differentially spaced" above membrane, was merely tangential to contested element in accused device, and thus prosecution history estoppel did not apply;
 
all limitations rule did not preclude finding that dome in accused device was equivalent to claimed "plate";
 
district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding prior art device from evidence; and
 
competitor was not prejudiced by jury instruction that permitted adverse inference to be drawn against natural person who later had judgment against him vacated.
 
Affirmed.
