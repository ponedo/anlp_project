Synopsis
Background: Patentee commenced action against competitors, alleging infringement of patents directed toward methods of treating osteoporosis through once monthly administration of ibandronate. The United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, Stanley R. Chesler, J., 2011 WL 7121450, construed the patent claims, and ruled on motion for summary judgment that claims were invalid in part, 2012 WL 1637736, and denied reconsideration, 2013 WL 323335. Patentee appealed.
 
The Court of Appeals, Bryson, Circuit Judge, held that selection of once monthly oral dosing regimen of ibandronate to treat osteoporosis and to set that dose at 150 mg would have been obvious at the time of the invention.
 
Affirmed.
 
Newman, Circuit Judge, filed dissenting opinion.
