Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc Denied Jan. 30, 2008.*
Synopsis
Background: Assignee of patents related to prevention of software piracy sued competitor for infringement. After jury found that competitor had infringed patents and did not prove that patents were invalid, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Leonard Davis, J., 2006 WL 2401099,denied competitor's renewed motions for judgment as a matter of law and motion for new trial. Competitor appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Linn, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
as used in patent claims, term "user" meant "a person or a person using a computer";
 
substantial evidence supported jury verdict finding of infringement of "user" limitation, even under modified claim construction;
 
substantial evidence supported finding of infringement of patent claims' "password" and "authorization code" limitations;
 
patents' "automatic" and "electronic" claim limitations did not require that initiation of registration communication commence without any user interaction;
 
substantial evidence supported jury's determination that patents were not invalid for anticipation;
 
erroneous instruction did not warrant new trial on issue of anticipation; and
 
refusing to give competitor's requested jury instruction was not abuse of discretion.
 
Affirmed.
