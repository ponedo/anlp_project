United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
PPG INDUSTRIES, INC., Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
GUARDIAN INDUSTRIES CORPORATION, Defendant-Appellant.
No. 95-1222.
|
Feb. 6, 1996.
Synopsis
Patentee brought infringement action against competitor, alleging infringement of its patent for automotive solar control glass. The United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, Gary L. Lancaster, J., entered preliminary injunction in favor of patentee, and competitor appealed. The Court of Appeals, Bryson, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) competitor's automotive solar control glass, which filtered ultraviolet infrared radiation, could infringe patented glass, even if inventor's use of flawed testing equipment led to belief that glass having composition of competitor's glass would not satisfy patent's 31% ultraviolet transmission requirement; (2) inventors' mistaken belief at time they applied for patent for solar control glass that competitor's glass could not meet transmittance limitations in patent claims did not establish that patent claims did not accurately and distinctly set out what inventors regarded as their invention; (3) patent satisfied statutory enablement requirement; (4) sulfur content in competitor's automotive solar control glass, which was not required contained in patent, did not establish that competitor's glass was not infringing; (5) patent was not invalid on grounds of obviousness or anticipation; (6) patentee's showing that it was likely to prevail on issues of patent validity and infringement entitled it to presumption of irreparable harm necessary for preliminary injunctive relief; and (7) balance of hardships and public interest favored grant of injunctive relief.
