Synopsis
In action for infringement of patents relating to high efficiency heat exchanger designed for use with blood oxygenator, the United States District Court for the Central District of California, 601 F.Supp. 964, A Wallace Tashima, J., entered injunction permanently enjoining manufacturer from further infringing patent claims. On subsequent motion for stay of injunction pending appeal on the merits, the United States District Court for the Central District of California, denied the motion. The Court of Appeals, 782 F.2d 992dismissed an appeal. On appeal on the merits, Court of Appeals, Baldwin, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) the evidence supported jury's findings that patent owner had made no misrepresentations or omissions in dealing with Patent and Trademark Office; (2) record supported finding of willful infringement and award of double damages and attorney fees; (3) manufacturer was not entitled to new trial; and (4) jury's finding that no misrepresentation or omission was made in dealings with Patent and Trademark Office by patent owner, attorney, or agent, was supported by substantial evidence, so that questions on materiality and intent did not arise.
 
Affirmed.
