Synopsis
Patent infringement action was brought. The United States District Court for the District of Maryland, John R. Hargrove, J., refused to enforce patent's claims and awarded attorney fees to defendant. Plaintiff appealed. The Court of Appeals, Rader, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) plaintiff's inequitable conduct before Patent and Trademark Office rendered patent unenforceable, and (2) award of attorney fees was not an abuse of discretion.
 
Affirmed.
