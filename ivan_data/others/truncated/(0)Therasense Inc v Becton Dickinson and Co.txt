Synopsis
Background: Patentee brought action against competitor alleging infringement of patent directed to electrochemical sensors for measuring glucose levels in blood. In accordance with a jury verdict, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, William H. Alsup, J., found claims of patent infringed, but invalid, and subsequently denied patentee's post-trial motions for judgment as a matter of law (JMOL) and for new trial. Patentee appealed, and competitor cross-appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Linn, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
district court's jury instruction on law of anticipation was legally erroneous, but
 
district court's error did not have prejudicial effect.
 
Affirmed.
