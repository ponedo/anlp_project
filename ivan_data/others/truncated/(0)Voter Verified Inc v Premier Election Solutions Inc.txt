The United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, No. 09-CV-1968, Patricia C. Fawsett, Senior District Judge, 739 F.Supp.2d 1340, construed patent and ruled it not infringed, 745 F.Supp.2d 1237, ruled patent invalid in part, 2011 WL 233804, ruled patent invalid in part and, 2011 WL 3841580,denied patent holder's motion for reconsideration, 2011 WL 250426, ruled patent invalid in part, 2011 WL 3236023, ruled patent not infringed in part, 2011 WL 148879 and 2011 WL 108396, denied patent holder's motion to suspend case management and scheduling order, and, 2011 WL 3269595,denied patent holder's motion for summary judgment and, 2011 WL 3862450,denied reconsideration of that order. Patent holder appealed, and appeals were consolidated.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Lourie, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
article obtained from online periodical qualified as prior art printed publication;
 
article rendered patent claim obvious;
 
patent claims describing self-verifying voting system were not infringed; and
