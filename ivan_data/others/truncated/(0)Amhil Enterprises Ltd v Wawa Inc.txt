and
M & N Plastics, Inc. and Ivonis Mazzarolo, Defendants-Appellees.
No. 95-1258.

April 18, 1996.
Synopsis
Assignee of patent for plastic beverage container lids brought infringement action against convenience store chain which allegedly provided infringing lids to customers, manufacturer of those lids, and manufacturer's sole officer. The United States District Court for the District of Maryland, John R. Hargrove, Senior District Judge, dismissed officer and granted summary judgment of noninfringement, 1995 WL 131296. Assignee appealed. The Court of Appeals, Rich, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) patent claim's reference to "substantially vertical" faces, side edges, and side walls required that such components deviate only slightly, if at all, from vertical; (2) accused devices did not literally infringe patent; and (3) assignee waived right to appeal judgment of noninfringement under doctrine of equivalents.
 
Affirmed.
