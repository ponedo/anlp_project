Synopsis
Background: Holder of patent for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor) and calcium antagonist drug brought action against competitor alleging patent infringement. Following jury verdict in favor of patent holder, competitor moved for judgment as a matter of law with regard to standing, lost profits, obviousness and obviousness type double patenting. Holder moved for permanent injunction. The United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, Dennis M. Cavanaugh, 821 F.Supp.2d 681, granted patent holder's motion and denied competitor's motion. Competitor appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Newman, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
district court's judgment in patent infringement action was final and ripe for appeal;
 
substantial evidence supported finding that patent was not obvious;
 
it was within district court's discretion to give jury instruction on destruction of evidence; and
 
owner of approved new drug application (NDA) for product and its distributor had standing to participate in patent infringement suit.
 
Affirmed and remanded.
