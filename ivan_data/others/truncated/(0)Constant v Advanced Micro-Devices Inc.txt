Synopsis
Patentee sued large group of high technology companies for patent infringements. Defendants filed counterclaims for declaratory relief asking to have patents declared invalid, unenforceable and not infringed. The United States District Court for the Central District of California, Stephen V. Wilson, J., entered summary judgment declaring claims of two patents to be invalid, and patentee appealed. The Court of Appeals, Davis, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) statute permitting federal courts to adjudicate validity of patents when invalidity is raised as an affirmative defense in infringement suits is not unconstitutional; (2) government sponsorship of research and development is not unconstitutional; and (3) evidence supported district court's findings that patents were invalid on basis of prior art and obviousness.
 
Affirmed.
