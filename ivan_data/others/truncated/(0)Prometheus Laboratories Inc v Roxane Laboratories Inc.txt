Synopsis
Background: Assignee commenced action against competitor, alleging infringement of patent claiming method of treatment for diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome utilizing alosetron. The United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, Faith S. Hochberg, J., 2013 WL 6627640, ruled that claims would have been obvious over the prior art or, in the alternative, invalid on grounds of obviousness-type double patenting. Assignee appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Dyk, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
patent was obvious;
 
secondary considerations did not support conclusion that patent was not obvious; and
 
district court did not place burden of proof on assignee to demonstrate nexus between drug's commercial success and patent, in analysis of whether patent was obvious.
 
Affirmed.
