Rehearing En Banc Denied July 10, 2007.
Synopsis
Background: Patentee sued competitor for infringement of patent related to patient identification system. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of California, Frank C. Damrell, Jr., J., 2006 WL 1652518,dismissed action, finding patent unenforceable due to inequitable conduct. Patentee appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Clevenger, Senior Circuit Judge, held that:
 
prior art that applicant failed to disclose was not merely cumulative to prior art which was before examiner;
 
overwhelming circumstantial evidence, coupled with lack of any credible explanation for nondisclosure of prior art, supported finding that patentee had deceptive intent;
 
prior rejection of three-node communication claim would have been considered important by any reasonable examiner reviewing application;
 
patentee intended to deceive Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) by not disclosing to examiner adverse decisions by another examiner in a closely-related application;
 
allowance of claims to a three-node communication system was material to application and should have been disclosed to examiner; and
 
district court's holding patent unenforceable was not abuse of discretion.
 
Affirmed.
 
Newman, Circuit Judge, filed a dissenting opinion.
