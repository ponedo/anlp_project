828 F.2d 1572
United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
KORODY-COLYER CORPORATION, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
GENERAL MOTORS CORPORATION, Defendant-Appellee.
No. 87-1180.
|
Sept. 18, 1987.
Synopsis
Action was brought alleging antitrust violation. The United States District Court for the Central District of California, Mariana R. Pfaelzer, J., granted defendant partial summary judgment and dismissed as untimely certain antitrust claims and appeal was taken. The Court of Appeals, Markey, Chief Judge, held that: (1) order staying proceedings on antitrust claim pending completion of bench trial of patent validity issue did not toll running of statute of limitations on plaintiff's amended antitrust claims; (2) plaintiff's amended antitrust claims were entirely different than claims in original complaint, and thus amendment did not relate back to original complaint for statute of limitations purposes; and (3) defendant's alleged concealment of evidence from plaintiff did not toll statute of limitations on plaintiff's amended antitrust claims.
 
Affirmed.
