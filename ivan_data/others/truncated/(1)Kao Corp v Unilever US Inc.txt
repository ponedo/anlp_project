Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc Denied May 31, 2006.*
Synopsis
Background: Owners of patent for composition and method for unclogging skin pores sued competitor for infringement. The United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Sue L. Robinson, Chief Judge, 334 F.Supp.2d 527, found patent valid and enforceable, but not infringed. Parties cross-appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Gajarsa, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
patent satisfied written description requirement;
 
finding of no inequitable conduct was not abuse of discretion;
 
patent was not literally infringed; and
 
Finding that case was not exceptional, and thus did not warrant award of attorney fees, was not clearly erroneous.
 
Affirmed.
 
Newman, Circuit Judge, concurred in part, dissented in part, and filed opinion.
 
Mayer, Circuit Judge, concurred in part, dissented in part, and filed opinion.
