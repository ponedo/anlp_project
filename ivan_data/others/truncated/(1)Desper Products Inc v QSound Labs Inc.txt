157 F.3d 1325
United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
DESPER PRODUCTS, INC. and Spatializer Audio Laboratories, Inc., Plaintiffs-Appellees,
v.
QSOUND LABS, INC., Defendant-Appellant.
No. 97-1163.
|
Sept. 18, 1998.
Synopsis
Patentee's competitors brought declaratory judgment action against patentee, seeking that their product did not infringe patents for an audio sound image location system and that patents were invalid, and patentee counterclaimed for patent infringement. The United States District Court for the Central District of California, William Duffy Keller, J., entered summary judgment in favor of competitors, and patentee appealed. The Court of Appeals, Plager, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) district court correctly interpreted patent claims; (2) prosecuting attorney's remarks during prosecution of the applications could be used to interpret disputed claim language; (3) patents were not literally infringed; and (4) prosecution history estopped precluded finding of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents.
 
Affirmed.
