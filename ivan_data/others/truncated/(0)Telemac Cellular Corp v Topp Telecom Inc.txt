Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc Denied June 1, 2001.
Synopsis
Patentee brought suit against competitor for infringement of its patent for a mobile cellular telephone system having a host processor and internal accounting capabilities for performing real-time call debiting. The United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Claudia Wilken, J., granted summary judgment to competitor, finding certain claims of patent invalid and not infringed. Patentee appealed. The Court of Appeals, Gajarsa, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) claim limitation of a communication means for selectively establishing a communication link with each mobile telephone unit described the selective and automatic establishment by host processor of communications for performing activation or programming, and did not encompass systems in which user manually established communications; (2) limitation of a complex billing algorithm required the storage of phone rates for, at a minimum, local, long distance, international, and roaming calls, and a means for identifying appropriate rate category; (3) disputed claims were anticipated by prior art; and (4) claims were not infringed literally or under doctrine of equivalents.
 
Affirmed.
