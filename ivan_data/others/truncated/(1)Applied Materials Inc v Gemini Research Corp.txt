APPLIED MATERIALS, INC., Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.

As Modified on Grant of Rehearing March 14, 1988.
Synopsis
Action was brought for defendant's alleged infringement of patents related to apparatus and methods of chemical vapor deposition. The United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Robert P. Aguilar, J., granted defendant's motions for summary judgment based on alleged invalidity of patents, and appeal was taken. The Court of Appeals, Baldwin, Senior Circuit Judge, held that: (1) presumption of validity attaching to patent, which was finally issued after applicant introduced new evidence to rebut prior finding of prima facie obviousness, carried with it the assumption that new evidence was material, and (2) patent that was issued for radiation-heated reactor used in chemical vapor deposition did not anticipate later patent issued for chemical vapor deposition process and thereby render it invalid.
 
Vacated and remanded.
