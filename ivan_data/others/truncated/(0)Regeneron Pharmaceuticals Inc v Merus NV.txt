United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., Plaintiff-Appellant
v.
MERUS N.V., Defendant-Appellee
2016-1346
|
Decided: July 27, 2017
Synopsis
Background: Patent assignee brought action against competitor, alleging infringement of patent on method of modifying eukaryotic cells. Competitor counterclaimed alleging unenforceability due to patentee's conduct during patent prosecution. Following bench trial on inequitable conduct counterclaim, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 1:14-cv-01650-KBF, Katherine B. Forrest, J., 144 F.Supp.3d 530, entered judgment for competitor. Assignee appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Prost, Chief Judge, held that:
 
term "a genetically modified mouse, comprising in its germline human unrearranged variable region gene segments inserted at an endogenous mouse immunoglobulin locus" was not limited to a reverse chimeric mouse;
 
prior international patent publication on chimeric and transgenic animals capable of producing human antibodies was but-for material;
 
prior journal article on targeted insertion of a variable region gene into the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus was but-for material;
 
prior journal article on cre-loxp-mediated gene replacement was but-for material; and
 
the District Court did not abuse its discretion in drawing an adverse inference that patentee acted with a specific intent to deceive the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) when it withheld prior art references during patent prosecution.
 
Affirmed.
 
Newman, Circuit Judge, filed a dissenting opinion.
