714 F.2d 1573
United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
RICHDEL, INC., Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
SUNSPOOL CORPORATION, Defendant-Appellee.
Appeal No. 83-611.
|
Aug. 3, 1983.
Synopsis
Plaintiff appealed from a judgment of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California holding a patent claim by plaintiff invalid and unenforceable. The Court of Appeals, Rich, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) it was error for the trial court to have shifted the burden of proof and so require plaintiff to prove facts necessary to a conclusion of nonobviousness, and (2) the evidence was sufficient to sustain the finding that claim one of patent No. 4,191,166, relating to a solar water heater system, was obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made, and thus the claim was invalid.
 
Affirmed.
