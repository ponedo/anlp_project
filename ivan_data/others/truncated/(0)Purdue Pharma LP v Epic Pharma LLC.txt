Synopsis
Background: Patent owner brought action against manufacturer of generic pharmaceutical products, alleging infringement of patents reciting improved formulation of oxycodone and patents claiming technology making tablets resistant to abuse. Following bench trial, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Sidney H. Stein, J., 994 F.Supp.2d 367, found patents infringed and invalid as anticipated by or obvious over the prior art. Patent owner appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Prost, Chief Judge, held that:
 
claims reciting oxycodone active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) product with low alpha, beta unsaturated ketone (ABUK) levels were invalid for obviousness, and
 
patent covering abuse-resistant formulations was anticipated by prior art reference.
 
Affirmed.
