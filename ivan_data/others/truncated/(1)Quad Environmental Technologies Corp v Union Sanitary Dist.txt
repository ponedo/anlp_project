Suggestion for Rehearing In Banc Declined Dec. 13, 1991.
Synopsis
Action was brought alleging direct and contributory infringement of reexamined patent describing and claiming a method of removing odors from dry waste gas streams. The United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Fern M. Smith, J., granted defendant's motion for summary judgment of invalidity for obviousness. Inventor's assignee appealed. The Court of Appeals, Pauline Newman, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) assignee's filing of terminal disclaimer to obviate double patenting issue was not admission that claims of subsequent patent were obvious in view of disclosure of previous patent, and therefore assignee was not estopped from arguing that claims of subsequent patent were unobvious in view of process which embodied invention of previous patent, and (2) examiner could not have based reexamination on admission of public use, and therefore assignee was not estopped from defending validity on that ground.
 
Reversed and remanded.
