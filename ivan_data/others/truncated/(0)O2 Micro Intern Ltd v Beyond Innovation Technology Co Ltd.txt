Synopsis
Background: Owner of patents relating to inverter controllers, which convert low voltage direct current (DC) into higher voltage alternating current (AC), brought infringement action against competitors. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, T. John Ward, J., 2007 WL 869576, inter alia granted patent owner a permanent injunction. Competitors appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Prost, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
competitors did not waive on appeal any objection to claim construction determined at Markman hearing;
 
arguments regarding the meaning and legal significance of "only if" limitation were improperly submitted to the jury; and
 
prosecution history estoppel barred patent owner from relying on the doctrine of equivalents.
 
Vacated and remanded.
