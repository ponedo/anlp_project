Federal Circuit.
MARINE POLYMER TECHNOLOGIES, INC., Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
HEMCON, INC., Defendant-Appellant.
No. 2010-1548.

March 15, 2012.
Synopsis
Background: Patentee sued competitor for allegedly infringing patent for polymer that promoted hemostasis, stopping bleeding or hemorrhage. The United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire, Joseph A. DiClerico, Jr., J., 2008 WL 1995454, construed patent, subsequently granted patentee summary judgment of literal infringement, and after jury verdict in favor of patentee on invalidity defenses of anticipation and obviousness, 2010 WL 3070197, granted patentee summary judgment on competitor's inequitable conduct defense, then entered judgment awarding patentee $29,410,246 damages as reasonable royalties for past infringement and permanently enjoined future infringement, and 2010 WL 3120051, denied competitor's motion for judgment as matter of law. Competitor appealed. The Court of Appeals, Dyk, Circuit Judge, 659 F.3d 1084, reversed judgment on infringement, vacated injunction and damages award, and remanded upon concluding that competitor had acquired intervening rights based on patentee's actions during parallel reexamination proceeding. Subsequently, the Court of Appeals, 2012 WL 255331,vacated appellate judgment and granted rehearing en banc.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, en banc, Lourie, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
for an equally divided court, claim was correctly construed;
 
for an equally divided court, substantial evidence supported jury's damages award;
 
intervening rights do not apply to claims that have not been amended and are not new; and
 
competitor did not acquire intervening rights to patent.
 
Affirmed.
 
Dyk, Circuit Judge, filed opinion dissenting in part, with whom Gajarsa, Reyna, and Wallach, Circuit Judges, joined in full, and Linn, Circuit Judge, joined in part.
