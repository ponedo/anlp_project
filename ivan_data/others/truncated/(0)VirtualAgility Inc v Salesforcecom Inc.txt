Synopsis
Background: Patentee brought patent infringement claims against alleged competitors. After a competitor filed a petition with the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) for post-grant review of an alleged covered business method (CBM) patent, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, J. Rodney Gilstrap, J., 2014 WL 94371, denied the competitors' request for a stay pending CBM review. The competitors appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Moore, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
factors regarding simplification of the issues and reduced burden of litigation strongly favored a stay;
 
factor regarding the state of litigation strongly favored a stay; and
 
factor regarding undue prejudice or tactical advantage weighed slightly against a stay.
 
Reversed and remanded.
 
Newman, Circuit Judge, filed a dissenting opinion.
