Synopsis
Owner of patent for anti-ulcer drug famotidine brought infringement action against competitor, who had filed Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) for generic version. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Richard Owen, Senior Judge, 21 F.Supp.2d 366, held for owner and awarded attorney fees. On appeal, the Court of Appeals, Rader, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) patent was not invalid as obvious, and (2) filing of baseless ANDA warranted award of attorney fees.
