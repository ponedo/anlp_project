Synopsis
On appeal from judgment of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, Grady, J., for defendant in patent infringement action, the Court of Appeals, Lourie, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) patents on centerpivot arched tongue harvester and harvesting method were invalid as anticipated; (2) trial court's failure to tell jury that inventor's testimony on conception had to be corroborated did not warrant new trial; and (3) trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding defendant only one half of its attorney fees on basis of plaintiff's wrongful refusal to admit certain facts during discovery.
 
Affirmed.
