United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
NORDBERG, INC., Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
TELSMITH, INC., Defendant-Appellant.
No. 95-1316.
|
April 24, 1996.
Synopsis
Patentee for gyratory rock crusher brought infringement action against competitor. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, Rudolph T. Randa, J., 881 F.Supp. 1252, held that patent was invalid, but determined that patentee did not engage in inequitable conduct during prosecution and that case was not "exceptional" for purpose of awarding attorney fees. Competitor appealed. The Court of Appeals, Lourie, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) patentee's employees were unaware of undisclosed prior art reference; (2) patentee could not "conceal" prior art reference of which it was not aware; (3) patentee did not conceal prior use of patented device with intent to mislead Patent and Trademark Office (PTO); (4) case was not "exceptional" for purpose of attorney fees provision; and (5) counsel's outburst during oral argument was inappropriate.
 
Affirmed.
