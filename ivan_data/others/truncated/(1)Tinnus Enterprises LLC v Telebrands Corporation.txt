846 F.3d 1190
United States Court of Appeals, Federal Circuit.
TINNUS ENTERPRISES, LLC, Zuru Ltd., Plaintiffs-Appellees
v.
TELEBRANDS CORPORATION, Bed Bath & Beyond, Inc., Defendants-Appellants
2016-1410
|
Decided: January 24, 2017
Synopsis
Background: Patentee brought action alleging competitor infringed its patent for a toy that filled multiple water balloons at once by channeling water into the balloons through a set of hollow tubes, connected to housing. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Robert Schroeder, III, J., 2015 WL 11089480, adopted report and recommendation of John D. Love, United States Magistrate Judge, 2015 WL 11089479, and entered preliminary injunction barring competitor from selling its product. Competitor appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Stoll, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
application of plain and ordinary meaning to term "attached" in patent was reasonable when analyzing patentee's likelihood of success on the merits;
 
it would review district court's determination that competitor failed to raise a substantial question that patent was invalid for indefiniteness for plain error, rather than for abuse of discretion;
 
competitor failed to raise a substantial question of patent's validity by arguing that patent claim term "substantially filled" was invalid for indefiniteness;
 
competitor did not show that patent was invalid as obvious; and
 
patentee demonstrated irreparable harm as a result of competitor's allegedly infringing product.
 
Affirmed.
