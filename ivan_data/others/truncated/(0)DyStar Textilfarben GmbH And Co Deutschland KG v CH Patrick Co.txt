Synopsis
Background: Patentee brought action against chemical manufacturers, alleging direct, contributory, and induced infringement of patent disclosing a process for dyeing textile materials with catalytically hydrogenated leuco indigo. The United States District Court for the District of South Carolina, William M. Catoe, Jr., United States Magistrate Judge, denied manufacturer's motions for judgment as matter of law (JMOL) or a new trial on anticipation and obviousness, and manufacturer appealed.
 
The Court of Appeals, Michel, Chief Judge, held that patent claims were invalid for obviousness.
 
Reversed.
