Synopsis
Background: Owner of patents for animal castration tool sued competitor for infringement. Following claim construction, 217 F.Supp.2d 1101, the United States District Court for the District of Montana, Donald W. Molloy, Chief Judge, entered judgment on jury verdict finding patents invalid and not infringed. Owner appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Rader, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
competitor bound by admissions that its accused devices included all claim limitations, even after appellate court found error in claim constructions under which admissions were made, and
 
asserted patents could claim prior patent's priority date, and thus were not anticipated by intervening patent.
 
Reversed and remanded.
