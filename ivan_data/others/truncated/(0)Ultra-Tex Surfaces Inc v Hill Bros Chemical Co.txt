Synopsis
Patentee brought action for infringement of patent for processes for creating low-cost, ornamental concrete surfaces. The United States District Court for the Central District of California, Gary L. Taylor, J., ruled that patent was valid and not infringed. Parties appealed. The Court of Appeals, Lourie, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) patent was not infringed under doctrine of equivalents, and (2) patent was not obvious.
 
Affirmed.
