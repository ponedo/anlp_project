United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
OSRAM SYLVANIA, INC., Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
AMERICAN INDUCTION TECHNOLOGIES, INC., Defendant-Cross Appellant.
Nos. 2012-1091, 2012-1135.
|
Dec. 13, 2012.
Synopsis
Background: Assignee filed action against competitor alleging infringement of patent directed toward low pressure, high intensity fluorescent light. The United States District Court for the Central District of California, Manuel L. Real, J., granted summary judgment that patent had been anticipated and was obvious. Assignee appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, O'Malley, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
factual issue existed on claim that patent had been anticipated;
 
competitor did not face enhanced burden in establishing anticipation because examiner considered prior art patent during prosecution of patent in suit; and
 
factual issue existed as to whether one of ordinary skill would consider lamp shape to be irrelevant.
 
Reversed and remanded.
