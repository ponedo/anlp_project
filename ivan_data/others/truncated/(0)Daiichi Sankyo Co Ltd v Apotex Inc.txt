Synopsis
Background: Holder of patent for method of treating bacterial ear infections via topical administration of antibiotic ofloxacin brought infringement action against recipient of abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) for manufacture of generic ofloxacin ear drop. The United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, 441 F.Supp.2d 672, William G. Bassler, Senior District Judge, entered judgment for patent holder, and ANDA recipient appealed.
 
The Court of Appeals, Archer, Senior Circuit Judge, held that method of treatment that was subject of patent would have been obvious to one having ordinary skill in the art, namely otolaryngologist or similar physician with training in pharmaceutical formulations.
 
Reversed.
