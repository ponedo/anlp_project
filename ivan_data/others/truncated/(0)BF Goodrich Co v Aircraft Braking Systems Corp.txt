The B.F. GOODRICH COMPANY, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.

Synopsis
Assignee of patents for brake assembly used in aircraft brought infringement actions against competitors. Competitors counterclaimed for declaratory judgment of invalidity and unenforceability, and cases were consolidated for trial. The United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Sue L. Robinson, J., found patents to be invalid and determined that assignee did not engage in inequitable conduct before Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). Assignee appealed, and competitors cross-appealed. The Court of Appeals, Lourie, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) brake assembly was invalid as obvious, and (2) assignee did not engage in inequitable conduct.
 
Affirmed.
