Rehearing Denied March 15, 1991.
Synopsis
Patent holder sued manufacturer of decorative caps for wheel nuts, alleging infringement. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, 679 F.Supp. 648, concluded that nuts literally infringed patent. Manufacturer appealed. The Court of Appeals, 854 F.2d 1328,vacated infringement judgment and remanded. On remand, the United States District Court, Bernard A. Friedman, J., determined that wheel caps infringed patent literally and under doctrine of equivalents. Manufacturer appealed. The Court of Appeals, Rader, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) District Court improperly interpreted claim by ignoring limitations added to distinguish structure of patent from prior art; (2) manufacturer's decorative caps for wheel nuts did not infringe on patented caps either literally or under doctrine of equivalents; and (3) doctrine of equivalents did not reach accused caps, inasmuch as hypothetical claim was obvious in light of three prior art references.
