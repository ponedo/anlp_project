Synopsis
Background: Assignee brought action against competitor alleging infringement of patent that claimed technique to achieve gradual ramping up of power signal in code division multiple access (CDMA) mobile communication system. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Leonard Davis, J., 2007 WL 294176,granted summary judgment that patent was invalid as anticipated. Assignee appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Moore, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
fact issue of whether prior art reference disclosed "synchronization prior to transmission" limitation in patent could not be raised by assignee for first time on appeal;
 
assignee did not raise issue before district court of whether prior art reference disclosed "synchronization prior to transmission" limitation in patent;
 
client's selection of new counsel for making appeal did not present exceptional case or circumstance in which declining appellate review of arguments not presented to district court would result in injustice;
 
Court of Appeals could not determine in first instance on appeal what particular prior art reference disclosed; and
 
assignee's argument raised for first time on appeal without any justification, as to what prior art reference disclosed, did not warrant remand to district court.
 
Affirmed.
