Synopsis
Background: Holder of patent for process of preparing a piperidine derivative compound commonly used as active ingredient in antihistamines brought action against generic drug manufacturers, alleging patent infringement. The United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, Garrett E. Brown Jr., Chief Judge, 2011 WL 2175928, construed patent claims. Defendants stipulated that they could no longer prove infringement, and the district court entered final judgment in plaintiff's favor. Defendants appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Reyna, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
term "substantially pure" should not have been construed to have same meaning in different patent claims;
 
term "substantially pure" only applied regioisomeric impurities; and
 
term "substantially pure" meant largely, but not wholly, the para regioisomer of the intermediate of the structure shown, as compared to the meta isomer.
 
Reversed and Remanded.
 
Bryson, Circuit Judge, filed dissenting opinion.
