Synopsis
Patent holder brought action alleging infringement of patents relating to high-speed chromatography known as "perfusive" chromatography. After finding that inventorship was incorrect, and denying patent holder's motion to correct inventorship, the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, Patti B. Saris, J., 12 F.Supp.2d 69, on reconsideration, vacated denial of motion to correct inventorship and held patents unenforceable due to inequitable conduct before the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). Patent holder appealed. The Court of Appeals, Clevenger, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) finding that named inventors intended to deceive PTO was not clearly erroneous; (2) falsehoods and omissions to the PTO were material to issue of inventorship; and (3) district court did not abuse its discretion in holding patents unenforceable.
 
Affirmed.
 
Pauline Newman, Circuit Judge, filed dissenting opinion.
