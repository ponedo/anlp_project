United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
CROWN PACKAGING TECHNOLOGY, INC. and Crown Cork & Seal USA, Inc., Plaintiffs-Appellants,
v.
BALL METAL BEVERAGE CONTAINER CORPORATION, Defendant-Appellee.
No. 2010-1020.

April 1, 2011.

Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc Denied June 1, 2011.
Synopsis
Background: Patentee brought action against competitor, alleging infringement of patents related to ends of metal beverage cans. Competitor counterclaimed for invalidity and unenforceability due to inequitable conduct. Parties moved for partial summary judgment. The United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Walter Herbert Rice J., 662 F.Supp.2d 939, granted competitor's motion for summary judgment invalidating the asserted patent claims for violating the written description requirement and because the claims were anticipated. Patentee appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Whyte, District Judge sitting by designation, held that:
 
common specification of asserted claims satisfied written description requirement, and
 
genuine issue of material fact precluded summary judgment that patents were invalid as anticipated.
 
Reversed and remanded.
 
Dyk, Circuit Judge, filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.
