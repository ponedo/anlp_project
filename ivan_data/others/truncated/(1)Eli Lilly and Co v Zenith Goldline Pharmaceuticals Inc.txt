Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc Denied March 29, 2007.
Synopsis
Background: Patent holder brought infringement action after generic drug manufacturers filed Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) to manufacture patented drug. The United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, Richard L. Young, J., 364 F.Supp.2d 820, granted judgment for patent holder. Defendants appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Rader, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
prior article that identified compounds from same family of compounds as subsequently patented drug did not anticipate that drug;
 
claims in subsequently patented drug were not obvious based upon prior art compound;
 
patentee overcame any prima facie case of obviousness;
 
patentee's clinical trials of claimed invention were experimental use that negated any public use bar; and
 
patent could not be invalidated on basis of inequitable conduct.
 
Affirmed.
