90 F.3d 1576
United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
VITRONICS CORPORATION, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
CONCEPTRONIC, INC., Defendant-Appellee.
No. 96-1058.
|
July 25, 1996.
Synopsis
Patentee brought action against competitor, alleging infringement of its patented method for reflow soldering of surface mounted devices to printed circuit boards. The United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire, Martin F. Loughlin, J., entered judgment in favor of competitor, and patentee appealed. The Court of Appeals, Michel, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) "solder reflow temperature" within meaning of patent meant peak reflow temperature, rather than "liquidus temperature," and (2) trial court erred in relying on expert testimony in interpreting claim.
 
Reversed and remanded.
