Synopsis
Holder of patents for ceramic foam filters for molten metal brought action against alleged infringers, and alleged infringers counter-claimed stating violation of Sherman Act. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Will, J., 716 F.Supp. 316, held patents unenforceable and invalid and denied alleged infringer's motion for attorney fees. Appeal and cross appeal were taken. The Court of Appeals, Markey, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) failure to disclose best mode of practicing patent and disclosure of fictitious inoperable mode warranted finding patent unenforceable under doctrine of unclean hands; (2) inequitable conduct in procuring one patent rendered related patents unenforceable; and (3) trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that action was not exceptional case warranting award of attorney fees.
 
Affirmed.
