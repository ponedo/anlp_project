Synopsis
Background: Assignee and licensee of patent for a phosphorus fertilizer brought infringement action against licensee's competitor. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of California, Robert E. Coyle, Senior District Judge, entered summary judgment in favor of competitor, and plaintiffs appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Plager, Senior Circuit Judge, held that:
 
amount of phosphorous-containing acid in claim limitation referred to amount of phosphorous-containing acid actually present in the final fertilizer product, not to a chemical equivalent amount;
 
"phosphorous-containing acid or salt" in claim language referred to an aggregate amount; and
 
patentee presumptively surrendered any equivalents with respect to the amount of phosphorous-containing acid or salt present by making narrowing amendment during reexamination.
 
Affirmed.
