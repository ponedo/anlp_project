Synopsis
Patentee brought action against competitor, alleging infringement of its patent for recalibrating sensors during kidney dialysis to accurately measure impurities removed from patient's blood. The United States District Court for the District of Colorado, Jim R. Carrigan, J., ruled that patent was invalid, and patentee appealed. The Court of Appeals, Rader, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) patent was not invalid on grounds of derivation; (2) patent was not invalid as obvious; and (3) patent was not invalid on grounds of inequitable conduct.
