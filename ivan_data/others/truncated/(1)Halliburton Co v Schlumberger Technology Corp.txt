Rehearing Denied March 15, 1991.
Synopsis
Patentholder appealed from judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Sim Lake, III, J., 722 F.Supp. 324, which held patents invalid. The Court of Appeals, Rader, Circuit Judge, held that failure to disclose cumulative references which were not more material than those which were cited to the examiner was not inequitable conduct.
