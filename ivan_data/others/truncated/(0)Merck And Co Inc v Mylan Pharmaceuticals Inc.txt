United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
MERCK & CO., INC., Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
MYLAN PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., Defendant-Appellee.
No. 99-1044.
|
Sept. 3, 1999.
Synopsis
Patentee brought action against competitor for infringement of two patents directed to controlled release formulation of drug combination used to treat Parkinson's disease. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Eduardo C. Robreno, J., 19 F.Supp.2d 334, granted summary judgment of noninfringement, and patentee appealed. The Court of Appeals, Pauline Newman, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) fact that patentee was required by examiner to elect a species from proposed genus of polymers listed in patent application did not establish that resulting amendment was not made to overcome patentability rejection, and (2) infringement claim was barred by prosecution history estoppel.
 
Affirmed.
