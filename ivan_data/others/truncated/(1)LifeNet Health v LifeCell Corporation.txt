837 F.3d 1316
United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
LIFENET HEALTH, Plaintiff-Appellee
v.
LIFECELL CORPORATION, Defendant-Appellant
2015-1549
|
Decided: September 16, 2016
Synopsis
Background: Patentee brought action against a competitor, complaining that the competitor's "ready to use" plasticized soft tissue grafts infringed on its patent governing the production and use of plasticized tissue grafts. Following a jury verdict on direct infringement and patent validity, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Henry Coke Morgan, Jr., Senior District Judge, 93 F.Supp.3d 477, denied competitor's motion for judgment as a matter of law on claim construction, non-infringement, and invalidity, and for new trial. Competitor appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Prost, Chief Judge, held that:
 
competitor did not properly raise its argument that district court erred by failing to resolve legal dispute regarding scope of non-removal limitation;
 
on issue of non-infringement, whether plasticizer was removed from internal matrix of accused tissue grafts before transplantation was for jury;
 
accused tissue grafts were complete when they left competitor's hands and infringed patent in that condition, without affirmative action by any third party;
 
non-removal limitation did not mix apparatus with method using that apparatus, and thus it was not indefinite on that ground;
 
term "plasticized soft tissue graft" meant "free and loosely bound waters of hydration in the tissue have been replaced with one or more plasticizers," without requiring that graft be "dehydrated"; and
 
on issue of obviousness, whether prior art disclosed "plasticized soft tissue graft" was question for jury.
 
Affirmed.
