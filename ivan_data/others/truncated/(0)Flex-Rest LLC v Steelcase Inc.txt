455 F.3d 1351
United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
FLEX-REST, LLC, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
STEELCASE, INC., Defendant-Cross Appellant.
Nos. 05-1354, 05-1367.

July 13, 2006.
Synopsis
Background: Patentee brought action against competitor, alleging infringement of patents for a computer keyboard positioning system that positioned the keyboard in a negative tilt position. Following remand, 112 Fed.Appx. 28, the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan, David W. McKeague, J., entered judgment finding that one patent was invalid for anticipation and obviousness and another patent was not infringed. Patentee appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Linn, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
competitor did not intentionally suppress or conceal alleged prior art device;
 
patent's "sidewall" limitation meant a structure projecting or extending upward, above the plane of the support surface, from either side of the support tray; and
 
patent counsel's failure to disclose to the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) a letter from a competitor which included photographs of a keyboard support system when applying for patent was not inequitable conduct.
 
Affirmed.
