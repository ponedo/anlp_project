Feb. 8, 2012.
Synopsis
Background: Patentee filed action against competitor alleging infringement of patents relating to technology for weighing objects, such as large commercial trucks. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Keith F. Giblin, United States Magistrate Judge, 551 F.Supp.2d 576, construed the claims and then jury rendered verdict in favor of competitor. Parties appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Moore, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
appropriate structure for disputed means-plus-function claim elements in patent was multiple slope integrating analog-to-digital converter and equivalents thereof;
 
substantial evidence supported jury determination that prior art patent taught correcting for load position;
 
substantial evidence existed for jury's conclusion that prior art patent did not teach away from patent; and
 
district court did not abuse its discretion by denying sanctions for alleged discovery abuses by patentee.
 
Affirmed.
