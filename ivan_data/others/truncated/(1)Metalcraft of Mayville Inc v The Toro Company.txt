848 F.3d 1358
United States Court of Appeals, Federal Circuit.
METALCRAFT OF MAYVILLE, INC., dba Scag Power Equipment, Plaintiff-Appellee
v.
THE TORO COMPANY, Exmark Manufacturing Co., Inc., Defendants-Appellants
2016-2433
|
2016-2514
|
Decided: February 16, 2017
Synopsis
Background: Owner of patent disclosing suspended operator platform for ride-on lawnmower or other riding light utility vehicle filed infringement action against lawnmower manufacturer. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, Rudolph T. Randa, J., 2016 WL 4076894, granted patentee's motion for preliminary injunction, and the same court, Lynn Adelman, J., 2016 WL 4402021, denied manufacturer's motion to stay entry of injunction. Manufacturer appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Moore, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
phrase "operator platform that supports ... an entire body of an operator" did not require that steering controls be mounted to suspended operator platform;
 
district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that patentee established likelihood of success;
 
district court did not clearly err in finding that claimed invention was not invalid for obviousness;
 
district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that patentee was likely to suffer irreparable harm;
 
district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that harm to patentee in absence of preliminary injunction outweighed manufacturer's harm if enjoined; and
 
district court's preliminary injunction was not overly broad.
 
Affirmed.
