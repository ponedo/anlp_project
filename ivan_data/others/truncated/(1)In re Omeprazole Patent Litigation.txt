Synopsis
Background: Owner of patents for pioneer drug to treat gastrointestinal disorders brought infringement action against applicants for approval to market generic versions. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Barbara S. Jones, J., 490 F.Supp.2d 381, declaring patents enforceable, not invalid, and infringed. Applicants appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Bryson, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
post-expiration remedy existed for infringement of patent on drug due to pediatric market exclusivity period;
 
patents did not require that omeprazole be stabilized without use of desiccant;
 
limitation, "alkaline reacting compound," was met by showing that basic compound created "micro-pH" in drug core of not less than 7;
 
enhanced stability of patented pharmaceutical preparation containing omeprazole was intended result of using inert subcoating around drug core containing amount of alkaline reacting compounds (ARC) in drug core sufficient to create micro-pH of not less than 7;
 
accused formulation met "inert subcoating" limitation;
 
owner could prove infringement by showing presence of claimed structure without identifying process by which infringing subcoating had been produced;
 
formulation used had not been ready for patenting until after extensive clinical studies and real-time stability testing had been completed; and
 
person of ordinary skill would not have had any reason to apply subcoating to tablets shown in example in European patent application.
 
Affirmed.
