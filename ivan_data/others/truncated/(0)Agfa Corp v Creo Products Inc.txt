Rehearing En Banc Denied Sept. 25, 2006.
Synopsis
Background: Patentee brought action against competitor, alleging infringement of its patents for an automated computer-to-plate system for making multiple printing plates. The United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, George A. O'Toole, Jr., J., 2004 WL 2387288, declared all the asserted patents unenforceable for inequitable conduct, and patentee appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Rader, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
trial court's decision to hold a bench trial on issue of patentee's alleged inequitable conduct did not preclude the court's later grant of a jury trial on issue of patent's validity;
 
term "stack" in the patents encompassed a number of plates arranged together in an orderly fashion, regardless of the orientation of the collection as a whole;
 
undisclosed prior art during prosecution of patents was material; and
 
evidence was sufficient to establish that patentee intended to deceive patent examiner.
 
Affirmed.
 
Newman, Circuit Judge, filed dissenting opinion.
