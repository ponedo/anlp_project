United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, Children's Medical Center Corporation, Plaintiffs-Appellees
v.
SHIRE PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., NKA Shire Pharmaceuticals LLC, Shire Regenerative Medicine, Inc., Defendants-Appellants
2015-1881
|
Decided: October 13, 2016
Synopsis
Background: Patent assignees brought action alleging infringement of two patents directed to three-dimensional scaffolding for growing cells in vitro to produce organ tissue in vivo. The United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, Mark L. Wolf, Chief Judge, construed specific terms and entered final judgment of validity and infringement. Defendants appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Stoll, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
during prosecution of patents, there was no clear and unmistakable disclaimer of including skin in construction of term "vascularized organ tissue";
 
during prosecution of patents, there was no clear and unmistakable disclaimer to preclude construction of term "cells derived from a vascularized tissue" to include both parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells; and
 
term "three-dimensional scaffold" was not invalid as indefinite and thus, according to its ordinary meaning, meant "a supporting structure that allows cells to attach along its width, length, and height."
 
Affirmed.
 
O'Malley, Circuit Judge, filed concurring opinion.
