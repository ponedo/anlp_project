Synopsis
Patentee brought action alleging infringement of patents for plastic modules used to form conveyor belts. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of California, William B. Shubb, Chief Judge, granted summary judgment for alleged infringer on grounds of noninfringement but granted summary judgment for patentee on issue of validity. Patentee appealed, and alleged infringer cross-appealed. The Court of Appeals, Lourie, Circuit Judge held that: (1) claims at issue required claimed modules to have flat driving surfaces, so claims were not literally infringed by accused devices which had curved driving surfaces; (2) "sprocket recess" limitation in patent required two opposing transverse elements, and patent was thus not literally infringed by accused device which contained single transverse section; and (3) patents were not infringed under doctrine of equivalents.
 
Affirmed.
