United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
IVERA MEDICAL CORPORATION, Plaintiff-Appellant
v.
HOSPIRA, INC., Defendant-Appellee.
Nos. 2014-1613, 2014-1614.

Sept. 8, 2015.
Synopsis
Background: Patentee brought action against alleged infringer regarding patents-in-suit for cleaning device that includes a cap that, when used, reliably disinfects a medical implement. Alleged infringer moved for summary judgment of invalidity. The United States District Court for the Southern District of California, Marilyn L. Huff, granted motion. Patentee appealed.
 
The Court of Appeals, Federal Circuit, Reyna, Circuit Judge, held that genuine issue of material fact as to whether a person of ordinary skill would have been motivated to add vent to disinfecting cap precluded summary judgment in favor of alleged infringer.
 
Reversed.
