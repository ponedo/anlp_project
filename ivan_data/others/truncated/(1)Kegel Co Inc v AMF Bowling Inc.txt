No. 96-1178.

Sept. 17, 1997
Synopsis
Assignee of patent for bowling lane maintenance machine and its exclusive licensee brought infringement action against competitor. Competitor counterclaimed, alleging that patent was invalid. The United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri, Bartlett, Chief Judge, entered judgment in favor of plaintiffs, and competitor appealed. The Court of Appeals, Schall, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) competitor's machine infringed patent because claim for maintenance assembly did not encompass function of control assembly; (2) patent claim was not anticipated by prior art machine; and (3) patent claim was not obvious.
 
Affirmed.
