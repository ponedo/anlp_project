Synopsis
Patentee brought action against competitor alleging infringement of patent for mousetrap. Following bench trial, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Carol Bagley Amon, J., held that patent was valid and infringed, and competitor appealed. The Court of Appeals, Clevenger, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) patent's phrase "plastic flow temperature above 120 degrees Fahrenheit" required that trap's adhesive had to resist flow when exposed for 24 hours to 120 degrees Fahrenheit in both horizontal and vertical orientations; (2) competitor's trap did not infringe patent absent showing that it resisted flow in horizontal orientation; and (3) to show that patent was not invalid for obviousness because of commercial success of patentee's product, patentee would have to show, on remand, nexus between commercial success and claimed invention.
 
Reversed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.
 
Rader, Circuit Judge, filed dissenting opinion.
