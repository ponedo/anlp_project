Federal Circuit.
INEOS USA LLC, Plaintiff-Appellant
v.
BERRY PLASTICS CORPORATION, Defendant-Appellee.
No. 2014-1540.

April 16, 2015.
Synopsis
Background: Owner of patent for polyethylene-based compositions used to form shaped products filed infringement action against competitor. The United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Gregg Costa, J., 2014 WL 1493852, entered summary judgment of invalidity, and patentee appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Moore, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
claim requiring that composition be comprised 0.05 to 0.5% by weight of at least one saturated fatty acid amide was anticipated by prior art;
 
prior art's disclosure of optional subsidiary lubricant and optional additive satisfied patent's limitations; and
 
prior art anticipated specification for saturated fatty acid amide behenamide as primary lubricant.
 
Affirmed.
