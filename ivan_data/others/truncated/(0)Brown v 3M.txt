Synopsis
Patentee brought suit alleging infringement of its patent for computer data processing system directed at solving Year 2000 (Y2K) problem by setting computer clock to an offset time. The United States District Court for the District of Arizona, Paul G. Rosenblatt, J., granted summary judgment of invalidity to competitor. Patentee appealed. The Court of Appeals, Pauline Newman, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) patent described an apparatus capable of converting only two-digit, only three-digit, only four-digit, or any combination of two-, three-, and four-digit date-data, and (2) patent thus was anticipated by prior art, and was invalid for lack of novelty.
 
Affirmed.
 
Mayer, Chief Judge, dissented and filed opinion.
