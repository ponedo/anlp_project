Synopsis
Petroleum refiners brought action against patentee, seeking a declaratory judgment to invalidate patent claiming automotive gasoline compositions designed to reduce automobile tailpipe emissions. Patentee counterclaimed, alleging willful infringement. After declaratory judgment action was effectively converted into infringement defense, jury found for patentee on issues of validity, and the United States District Court for the Central District of California denied refiners' motion for judgment as a matter of law (JMOL). The District Court, 34 F.Supp.2d 1208, 34 F.Supp.2d 1222, determined that patent was not unenforceable for inequitable conduct and awarded attorney fees. Refiners appealed. The Court of Appeals, Rader, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) patent claims were directed to compositions of matter and were not limited to only certain uses of those compositions; (2) patent claims were not anticipated by prior art; and (3) written description was adequate.
 
Affirmed.
 
Lourie, Circuit Judge, dissented in part and filed opinion.
