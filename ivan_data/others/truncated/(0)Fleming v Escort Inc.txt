United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
Hoyt A. FLEMING, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
ESCORT INC. and Beltronics USA, Inc., Defendants-Cross-Appellants.
Nos. 2014-1331, 2014-1371.
|
Dec. 24, 2014.
Synopsis
Background: Following jury verdict of infringement and invalidity in part of reissue patents related to radar detectors for detecting police signals, parties filed cross-motions for judgment as a matter of law on invalidity determinations. The United States District Court for the District of Idaho, B. Lynn Winmill, Chief Judge, 2014 WL 713532, denied motions. Cross-appeals were taken.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Taranto, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
substantial evidence supported determinations that claims in patents related to radar detectors for detecting police signals were invalid;
 
inventor's testimony of prior invention was sufficiently corroborated; and
 
patentee established error prerequisite for reissue patents.
 
Affirmed.
