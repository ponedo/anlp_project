April 9, 2012.
Synopsis
Background: Patentee filed actions against competitors, alleging infringement of patents directed toward composition of cancer drug docetaxel with reduced risk of alcohol intoxication and anaphylactic effects compared to prior art. Actions were consolidated. Following bench trial, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Gregory M. Sleet, Chief Judge, 743 F.Supp.2d 305, entered judgment in favor of competitors.
 
Holdings: Patentee appealed The Court of Appeals, Prost, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
"perfusion" meant an injectable solution containing the active pharmaceutical ingredient and an aqueous infusion fluid;
 
perfusion claim was invalid as obvious based on the prior art;
 
district court acted within its discretion in granting competitors' motions to amend pleadings, after scheduling order deadline, to add allegations related to inequitable conduct;
 
prior art references withheld from Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) were necessarily but-for material, as required to support defense that patents were unenforceable due to inequitable conduct; and
 
district court's finding that inventor acted with specific intent to deceive PTO in withholding prior art references was not clearly erroneous.
 
Affirmed.
