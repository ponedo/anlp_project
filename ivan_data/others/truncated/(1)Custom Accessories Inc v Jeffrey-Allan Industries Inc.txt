United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
CUSTOM ACCESSORIES, INC., Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
JEFFREY-ALLAN INDUSTRIES, INC., Defendant-Appellee.
Appeal No. 85-2728.
|
Dec. 12, 1986.
Synopsis
Patent holder brought infringement action. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, James B. Moran, J., determined that claims of patent for mud flap and splash guard assemblies were obvious and invalid. Holder appealed. The Court of Appeals, Edward S. Smith, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) old or unpatentable nature of each element in claimed invention for mud flap or splash guard assemblies did not determine that invention was obvious and that patent was invalid; (2) District Court was required to consider objective evidence of nonobviousness, which included evidence of copying and commercial success; and (3) District Court failed to make sufficient, required findings with regard to scope and content of prior art, differences between prior art and claims at issue, level of ordinary skill in art, and objective evidence of nonobviousness.
 
Vacated and remanded.
