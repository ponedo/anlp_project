v.
BOSTON SCIENTIFIC CORPORATION, Scimed Life Systems, Inc., nka Boston Scientific Scimed, Inc., Defendants-Cross-Appellants

Decided: September 29, 2017
Synopsis
Background: Assignor of patent directed at coronary stent brought action alleging that patent assignee's accused device infringed certain claims of patent, thereby entitling assignor to royalty payments under assignment agreement. Following jury trial, the United States District Court for the Central District of California, No. 5:05-cv-00426-VAP-MRW, denied assignor's motion for judgment as a matter of law, vacated jury's finding that accused device infringed patent under doctrine of equivalents, and entered judgment of noninfringement. Assignor appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Chen, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
sufficient evidence supported jury's finding that accused device did not literally infringe claimed connecting strut columns;
 
hypothetical claim that added flexibility requirement narrowed scope of issued claim, precluding any ensnarement analysis on such basis;
 
hypothetical claim that stated first connecting strut had to include "at least" proximal, distal, and intermediate sections had same claim scope as issued claim, precluding any ensnarement analysis on such basis; and
 
assignor was not prejudiced by any lack of pretrial discovery as to assignee's ensnarement defense.
 
Affirmed.
