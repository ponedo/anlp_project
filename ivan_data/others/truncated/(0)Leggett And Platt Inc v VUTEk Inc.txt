Rehearing Denied Sept. 26, 2008.
Synopsis
Background: Patent owner sued competitor alleging infringement of patent that consisted of methods and apparatus for jetting, freezing, and substantially curing UV-curable inks onto substrate without deforming substrate. Competitor counterclaimed for declaratory judgments of noninfringement and invalidity. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, Catherine D. Perry, J., 2006 WL 3813677,granted summary judgment of invalidity. Owner appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Prost, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
prior art patent that may not have expressly disclosed that light emitting diodes (LEDs) cured ink to great extent nevertheless inherently disclosed LEDs that were "effective to" do so, and
 
question of whether reference taught away from patented invention was inapplicable to anticipation analysis.
 
Affirmed.
