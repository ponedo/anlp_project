Synopsis
Owner of patents for intermittent windshield wipers brought infringement action against automobile manufacturer. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Cohn, J., entered judgment on jury verdict for owner, and cross-appeals were taken. The Court of Appeals, Lourie, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) stipulation bound manufacturer to finding of patent validity in action against other manufacturers; (2) evidence supported finding of infringement; and (3) owner was entitled to reasonable royalty, but not lost profits.
 
Affirmed.
