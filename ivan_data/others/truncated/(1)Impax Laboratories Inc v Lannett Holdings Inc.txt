893 F.3d 1372
United States Court of Appeals, Federal Circuit.
IMPAX LABORATORIES INC., AstraZeneca AB, AstraZeneca UK Limited, Plaintiffs-Appellees
v.
LANNETT HOLDINGS INC., Lannett Company Inc., Defendants-Appellants
2017-2020
|
Decided: June 28, 2018
Synopsis
Background: Assignee, assignor, and exclusive licensee brought action alleging infringement of patents directed to nasal formulation for drug used to treat migraines, after alleged infringers filed Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA). Alleged infringers stipulated to infringement, but challenged plaintiffs' standing to bring suit and validity of patents. The United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Nos. 1:14-cv-00984-RGA, 1:14-cv-00999-RGA, Richard G. Andrews, J., 2015 WL 7737309, construed the claims, and held after bench trial that patents were not invalid as anticipated or obvious, 246 F.Supp.3d 1024. Infringers appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Lourie, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
district court did not clearly err in finding that skilled artisan would have looked to any other triptan before looking to zolmitriptan to develop pharmaceutical product that would not take advantage of first pass metabolism;
 
district court in its analysis of secondary considerations did not clearly err in finding that licensing agreement was at least in part attributable to patents; and
 
patents were not obvious based on prior art that mentioned zolmitriptan in connection with nasal formulations and sprays.
 
Affirmed.
 
Procedural Posture(s): On Appeal; Judgment.
*1374 Appeal from the United States District Court for the District of Delaware in Nos. 1:14-cv-00984-RGA, 1:14-cv-00999-RGA, Judge Richard G. Andrews.
