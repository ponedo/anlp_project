732 F.3d 1325
United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
BROADCOM CORPORATION, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
EMULEX CORPORATION, Defendant-Appellant.
No. 2012-1309.
|
Oct. 7, 2013.
Synopsis
Background: Patentee commenced action against competitor, alleging infringement of patent directed toward communication device configured to receive multiple serial data signals. The United States District Court for the Central District of California, James V. Selna, J., granted judgment of infringement and entered permanent injunction against competitor. Competitor appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Rader, Chief Judge, held that:
 
half-rate architecture in accused products "correspond[ed] to a frequency offset" as required by claim in patent;
 
evidence was sufficient to show that competitor infringed "at a rate so as to reduce" limitation;
 
patent was not obvious;
 
substantial evidence supported jury's finding of commercial success;
 
jury's finding of long-felt, but unsolved need was supported by substantial evidence;
 
patentee's exclusion from fair opportunity to compete for design wins constituted irreparable harm; and
 
district court did not abuse its discretion in issuing permanent injunction with 18 month sunset period.
 
Affirmed.
