799 F.3d 1372
United States Court of Appeals,
Federal Circuit.
DOME PATENT L.P., Plaintiff-Appellant
v.
Michelle K. LEE, Director, U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Defendant-Appellee.
No. 2014-1673.
|
Sept. 3, 2015.
Synopsis
Background: Patentee brought action seeking judicial review of Patent and Trademark Office's (PTO) reexamination decision canceling as obvious a patent claim disclosing a method of making a contact lens with increased oxygen permeability. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia, Paul L. Friedman, J., held that claim was invalid for obviousness. Patentee appealed.
 
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Federal Circuit, Hughes, Circuit Judge, held that:
 
PTO was required to show by a preponderance of the evidence that under ex parte reexamination the patent claim was shown to be obvious;
 
patent claim disclosed motivation to combine prior art, and thus was invalid for obviousness;
 
a person of ordinary skill would not have been dissuaded from combining prior art, and thus prior art did not teach away from combining elements of claim; and
 
PTO did not improperly shift burden onto patentee to prove nonobvious-ness once PTO established prima facie case of obviousness.
 
Affirmed.
