Nordberg , Inc. v. Telsmith , Inc. , 881 F.Supp . 1252 , 36 USPQ2d 1577 ( E.D.Wis.1995 ) . Because Telsmith has not demonstrated error in the court 's decision , we affirm . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ BACKGROUND _NEWLINE_ Nordberg , owner of the '373 patent directed to a gyratory rock crusher , sued Telsmith for infringement . Telsmith counterclaimed for a declaration that the asserted claims were invalid , unenforceable , and not infringed . After a bench trial , the district court found that the asserted claims were invalid for obviousness over the prior art , which included Nordberg 's own Saunders U.S. Patent 3,125,304 . The court also held that the claims were invalid based on Nordberg 's public use of the claimed invention at a quarry owned and operated by the Tanner Company in Phoenix , Arizona , more than one year before the filing date of the patent application . Nordberg has not appealed these determinations . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Although holding the patent invalid , the court rejected Telsmith 's claim that the patent was unenforceable because of Nordberg 's conduct . The court found that the Saunders patent and Tanner use constituted material prior art that was not disclosed to the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( `` PTO '' ) during prosecution of the '373 patent . The court also found , however , that the Nordberg employees who were under a duty of disclosure , including those who prosecuted the '373 patent , were unaware of the existence of the Saunders patent during prosecution . Thus , the court found that Nordberg did not conceal the Saunders patent . The court further found that the relevant Nordberg employees did not conceal the Tanner use from the PTO with the intent to mislead , because they believed in good faith that the field testing at Tanner occurred under a confidentiality agreement and thus was not material prior art . Because the court found no intention by Nordberg to mislead the PTO , it held that Nordberg did not engage in inequitable conduct . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ DISCUSSION _NEWLINE_ We review the district court 's conclusion concerning inequitable conduct for abuse of discretion . Molins PLC v. Textron , Inc. , 48 F.3d 1172 , 1178 , 33 USPQ2d 1823 , 1827 ( Fed.Cir.1995 ) . An abuse of discretion may be established by showing that the court based its ruling on clearly erroneous factual findings , an error of law , or a clear error of judgment . Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Telsmith challenges the court 's determination that Nordberg did not engage in inequitable conduct . * Telsmith asserts that Nordberg knew or should have known of the Saunders patent because Nordberg owned the patent , and a copy of the patent was in its files , which Nordberg allegedly routinely searched before filing patent applications . In addition , Telsmith argues that a Nordberg memorandum stating that the Tanner use might pose patentability problems in `` absolute novelty '' countries compels the inference that Nordberg knew that the Tanner use was material prior art . Telsmith further contends that the high materiality of the Saunders patent and the Tanner use requires an inference of an intent by Nordberg to mislead the PTO , which Nordberg did not rebut . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We consider these contentions to be unpersuasive . The district court found that the Nordberg employees who were under a duty of disclosure were unaware of the Saunders patent during prosecution of the '373 patent . This finding is not clearly *397 erroneous . Although a copy of the Saunders patent was in Nordberg 's files , the files contained several hundred patents and there was no showing that any Nordberg employee actually searched the files and found a copy of the Saunders patent during the pendency of the '373 patent application . Moreover , the unrebutted testimony of Nordberg 's in-house patent counsel indicated that regular searching of in-house prior art files began only recently , after the prosecution of the '373 patent . Thus , the court did not clearly err in finding that the relevant Nordberg employees were unaware of the Saunders patent during prosecution . Furthermore , since Nordberg could not have `` concealed '' a prior art reference of which it was unaware , the district court did not clearly err in finding that Nordberg did not conceal the Saunders patent with the intent to mislead the PTO . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Telsmith seeks to overcome the fatal lack of evidence that the relevant Nordberg employees knew of the Saunders patent 's existence by contending that `` Federal Circuit precedent does not require proof of actual knowledge of the withheld prior art , but only ... proof that the applicant or its representatives 'should have known of the art or information , ' `` citing our decisions in Molins PLC , 48 F.3d at 1178 , 33 USPQ2d at 1826 , and FMC Corp. v. Manitowoc Co. , 835 F.2d 1411 , 1415 , 5 USPQ2d 1112 , 1116 ( Fed.Cir.1987 ) . We long ago rejected this contention , American Hoist & Derrick Co. v. Sowa & Sons , Inc. , 725 F.2d 1350 , 1362 , 220 USPQ 763 , 772 ( Fed.Cir . ) ( `` Nor does an applicant for patent , who has no duty to conduct a prior art search , have an obligation to disclose any art of which , in the [ district ] court 's words , he 'reasonably should be aware . ' `` ) , cert . denied , 469 U.S. 821 , 105 S.Ct . 95 , 83 L.Ed.2d 41 ( 1984 ) , and neither FMC Corp. nor Molins PLC held to the contrary . Indeed , our decision in FMC Corp. , far from supporting Telsmith 's position , is directly to the contrary . There was no dispute in that case that the patentee knew of the undisclosed information 's existence ; only knowledge of the information 's materiality was in dispute . 835 F.2d at 1416 , 5 USPQ2d at 1116 . After noting that proof that the applicant knew of a reference 's materiality `` may be rebutted by a showing that ... [ the ] applicant did not know of that art or information , '' we discussed the `` should have known '' standard in connection with the reference 's materiality : _NEWLINE_ Applicant must be chargeable with knowledge of the existence of the prior art or information , for it is impossible to disclose the unknown . Similarly , an applicant must be chargeable with knowledge of the materiality of the art or information ; yet an applicant who knew of the art or information can not intentionally avoid learning of its materiality through gross negligence , i.e. , it may be found that the applicant `` should have known '' of that materiality . _NEWLINE_ Id . at 1415 , 835 F.2d 1411 , 5 USPQ2d at 1115-16 ( citation omitted ) . Similarly , in Molins PLC , we simply observed that `` [ o ] ne who alleges inequitable conduct arising from a failure to disclose prior art must offer clear and convincing proof of , '' inter alia , `` knowledge chargeable to the applicant of that prior art . '' 48 F.3d at 1178 , 33 USPQ2d at 1826 . It was undisputed that the applicant in Molins PLC knew of the existence of the undisclosed references , and the case thus can not stand for the proposition that Telsmith would have us draw from it . Telsmith 's contention that the `` failure of disclosure '' form of inequitable conduct can be shown with proof that the applicant did not but should have known of a reference 's existence runs counter to American Hoist and subsequent cases and must therefore be rejected . As we held in American Hoist , the applicant 's actual knowledge of the reference 's existence must be proved . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The court also found that the Nordberg employees who were under a duty of disclosure believed in good faith that the Tanner use occurred under a confidentiality agreement and thus was not material prior art . Again , Telsmith has not demonstrated that this finding is clearly erroneous . Telsmith relies on an internal Nordberg memorandum , which stated in relevant part : _NEWLINE_ Since the machine has been put in the field , even though a confidentiality exists between ourselves and Tanner , it could be construed because of the relatively open location near the airport and the free visiting *398 by various dealer personnel that the machine may not be patentable in the absolute novelty countries because of disclosure . This may be a negative factor in the potential and value for licensing the machine to our present licensees or for providing initial advantage to the marketing efforts of our overseas locations once the machine becomes a product . _NEWLINE_ Since the memorandum states that `` a confidentiality [ agreement ] exists between [ Nordberg ] and Tanner , '' it supports , rather than undermines , the district court 's finding that the relevant Nordberg employees believed in good faith that the Tanner use occurred under a confidentiality agreement and therefore was not material prior art . Furthermore , since the United States is not an `` absolute novelty '' country , the statement that the invention `` may not be patentable in the absolute novelty countries '' is not necessarily inconsistent with , let alone sufficient to establish clear error in , the court 's finding that Nordberg believed that the Tanner use was not material prior art . Thus , because the court did not clearly err in finding that Nordberg believed that the Tanner use was not material prior art , the court did not clearly err in finding that Nordberg did not conceal the Tanner use with the intent to mislead the PTO . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Telsmith has accordingly not shown that the district court clearly erred in finding that Nordberg did not conceal the Saunders patent and/or the Tanner use with the intent to mislead the PTO . Furthermore , because Telsmith did not make a threshold showing of intent by Nordberg to mislead the PTO , Nordberg had no burden to produce evidence of good faith and the court properly declined to balance materiality and intent . We have considered Telsmith 's remaining allegations of a `` pattern of misconduct and deception '' by Nordberg , but find them unpersuasive . We therefore conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that Nordberg did not engage in inequitable conduct . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Telsmith also argues that the district court erred in finding that this was not an `` exceptional '' case under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 285 . We disagree with Telsmith . The court did not abuse its discretion in holding that Nordberg did not engage in inequitable conduct , and it did not err in rejecting Telsmith 's contention that Nordberg commenced and continued litigating this case in bad faith . Thus , the court did not clearly err in finding that this was not an `` exceptional '' case under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 285 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In its brief , Nordberg alleges that Telsmith 's appeal was frivolous . During oral argument , however , Nordberg withdrew its allegation after the court pointed out that it was substantively and procedurally deficient . See Fed.R.App.P . 38 ( requiring separately filed motion or notice from the court and opportunity to respond ) . An allegation of a frivolous appeal should not be made cavalierly . We caution Nordberg and its counsel that `` [ u ] nfounded requests for sanctions are themselves frivolous and sanctionable . '' Atlantic Thermoplastics Co. v. Faytex Corp. , 970 F.2d 834 , 835 n. 1 , 23 USPQ2d 1481 , 1482 n. 1 ( Fed.Cir.1992 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ While Telsmith was entitled to appeal the denial of its claim , its counsel was not entitled to disrupt the oral argument with a display of temper . During his rebuttal argument , counsel turned around , pointed a finger at opposing counsel , and heatedly said : `` These two lawyers are bad lawyers . They deceived the examiners , they deceived the trial judge , and then they pull this here . '' This court is accustomed to hearing forceful argument . However , counsel 's outburst was unacceptable . Strong conviction concerning the merits of one 's case is not justification for losing one 's composure at oral argument and making pointed accusations at opposing counsel . Opposing attorneys are expected to disagree concerning the merits of their cases . However , the essence of legal process is rational and civil advocacy of one 's position . Angry , intemperate verbal attacks have no place in this court . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We caution counsel that improper conduct in the courtroom may be sanctionable . See Fed.R.App.P . 46 ( c ) ( conduct unbecoming a member of the bar is sanctionable ) . However , because counsel promptly apologized for his remarks when he was admonished from the bench during argument , we will let the *399 incident pass with a warning that such conduct is not acceptable . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ AFFIRMED . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 82 F.3d 394 , 64 USLW 2724 , 34 Fed.R.Serv.3d 1503 , 38 U.S.P.Q.2d 1593 _NEWLINE_ Footnotes _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ * _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Despite the fact that the patent has been held invalid , a holding which has not been appealed , the question of inequitable conduct is relevant to a possible award of attorney fees . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_

Re 34,162 issued January 19 , 1993 ( `` the ¡¬162 patent '' ) . The ¡¬162 patent is a reissue of U.S. Patent No . 4,728,395 , issued March 1 , 1988 to inventor George Boyd and assigned to Mr. Boyd 's employer Stackpole Fibers Company . The patent was acquired by Zoltek Corporation with its acquisition of Stackpole in 1988 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Litigation history _NEWLINE_ On March 25 , 1996 , Zoltek filed suit in the United States Court of Federal Claims ( CFC ) alleging that the process used to produce carbon fiber sheet materials for the B-2 Bomber and the F-22 Fighter Plane infringed the ¡¬162 patent . This is the third appeal in this action . The factual background is set forth in the prior opinions of the CFC and this court . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In the first appeal , this court answered a certified question to hold that the patentee has no cause of action against the United States when any step of the patented method is practiced outside of the United States , as for the F-22 Fighter . Zoltek Corporation v. United States , 442 F.3d 1345 , 1353 ( Fed.Cir.2006 ) ( Plager , J. , dissenting ) ( Zoltek I ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On remand , the CFC granted Zoltek 's request for leave to amend its complaint to substitute as defendant Lockheed Martin , the general contractor for the F-22 Fighter , and then granted Zoltek 's motion to transfer the count relating to the F-22 Fighter to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia , where it was `` reasonably plausible '' that the court had jurisdiction over an infringement suit against Lockheed . Zoltek Corporation v. United States , 85 Fed.Cl . 409 , 422 ( 2009 ) . On Lockheed 's motion , this aspect was certified for appeal . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Federal Circuit then acted en banc ( in part ) and reversed its ruling in Zoltek I . This court recognized the liability of the United States for infringement by acts that are performed with its authorization and consent . 28 U.S.C . ¡± 1498 ( a ) ( `` Whenever an invention described in and covered by a patent of the United States is used or manufactured by or for the United States without license of the owner thereof or lawful right to use or manufacture the same , the owner 's remedy shall be by action against the United States in the United States Court of Federal Claims for the recovery of his reasonable and entire compensation for such use and manufacture. '' ) . By statute the contractor is immunized from liability . Id . ( `` use or manufacture ... by a contractor ... shall be construed as use or manufacture for the United States '' ) . This court dismissed Lockheed as a party , negated the proposed transfer to Georgia , and remanded to the Court of Federal Claims for inclusion of counts for infringement with respect to both the F-22 Fighter and the B-2 Bomber . Zoltek Corporation v. United States , 672 F.3d 1309 , 1311 ( Fed.Cir.2012 ) ( en banc ) ( Zoltek II ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On remand , the CFC separated trial of the issues of validity and infringement , and denied discovery as to infringement with respect to the F-22 Fighter . Zoltek sought mandamus from this court concerning these actions ; the petition was denied . In re Zoltek Corporation , 526 Fed.Appx . 956 , 957 ( Fed.Cir.2013 ) ( non-precedential ) . Trial proceeded in the CFC , limited to validity . The government challenged the ¡¬162 patent under sections 101 , 103 , and 112 of Title 35 . The CFC sustained patent eligibility under section 101 ; that ruling is not appealed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ At trial , each side presented an expert witness , Dr. Brian Sullivan for the government and Mr. Zsolt Rumy for Zoltek . The *1305 CFC held the asserted claims invalid on the grounds of obviousness and inadequate written description . Zoltek Corporation v. United States , No . 96-166 C , 2014 WL 1279152 ( Fed.Cl . Mar . 31 , 2014 ) ( `` CFC Op. '' ) . Zoltek appeals , arguing that the CFC applied incorrect laws of written description and obviousness , that the CFC did not apply the appropriate burdens and standards of proof , and that the CFC erred in its conclusions . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Zoltek also argues that the issues were improperly bifurcated . We conclude that in the circumstances of this case , taking note of the government 's official invocation of state secret privilege , the CFC acted within its discretion in limiting trial initially to the issues of validity . However , as we next discuss , we conclude that the trial court erred in its judgment of patent invalidity . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Boyd Invention _NEWLINE_ The ¡¬162 patent is directed to a method of manufacturing carbon fiber sheet products whose electrical resistivity is pre-selected and value-controlled by the described method . This method is based on Boyd 's discovery of a non-linear relationship among the heat treatment conditions , partial carbonization , and surface resistivity1 of sheet products . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The method as claimed in the reissue patent starts with a previously oxidized and stabilized carbonizable fiber , a product known in the prior art and commercially available . This oxidized fiber is then partially carbonized in accordance with the relationship discovered by Boyd , to produce a partially carbonized fiber whose sheet products have the desired pre-selected surface electrical resistance . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This method permits production of carbonized sheets of pre-selected and uniform electrical resistance , and thus uniform pre-selected insulating properties . The ¡¬162 specification states that theretofore carbon fiber sheets having specified surface electrical resistance were available only by including other materials , such as glass or aluminum filaments , with the carbonized fibers . ¡¬162 patent , col. 1 ll.49-60 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Patent Figure 4 shows the foundation discovery of resistivity as a function of carbonizing temperature : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ? _NEWLINE_ *1306 The lower curve represents the volume resistivity for single fibers at the carbonizing temperature , and upper curves A and B show surface resistivities for one half ounce per square yard and one ounce per square yard sheet products incorporating the designated partially carbonized fibers . The patent describes and exemplifies the preparation of fibers having the preselected partial carbonization , and the production of sheet products having the desired electrical properties . Id. , col.4 ll.19-23 ( `` [ T ] he temperature-resistivity of the single carbonized fiber is translated into the preselected desired surface resistance of the resultant partially carbonized fiber sheet product produced with such fibers. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ It is not disputed that the non-linear relationship shown in Figure 4 , and its application to achieve the results described in the ¡¬162 patent , were not previously known . The government 's expert , Dr. Sullivan , stated to be one of the nation 's preeminent experts with a `` thirty-year career in research and design relating to carbon fiber science , '' U.S. Br . 22 , testified that his calculations pertaining to his reproduction of the Figure 4 curve were based on data that were not in the prior art and were selected retrospectively . No reference showed the relationship between volume or surface-resistivity of carbon fiber sheet products and treatment temperature of carbon fibers . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The CFC held claims 1-22 and 33-38 of the reissue patent invalid on two grounds , ( 1 ) that they did not meet the written description requirement , and ( 2 ) that the claimed invention would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in this field at the time of the invention . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Written Description _NEWLINE_ The claimed method is summarized in reissue claim 1 , shown as in the reissue patent , with deletions from the original claim in brackets and additions in italics-for these changes are the basis of the CFC 's ruling of invalidity on the ground of inadequate written description : _NEWLINE_ 1 . A method of manufacturing a plurality of different value controlled resistivity carbon fiber sheet products employing a carbonizable fiber starting *1307 material ; said method comprising [ oxidizing and stabilizing the carbonizable fiber starting material at an elevated temperature of the order of 220 degrees Centigrade to effect molecular aromatic rearrangement of the fibers , ] selectively partially carbonizing [ the ] previously oxidized and stabilized fiber starting material for a predetermined period in an oxygen free atmosphere within a furnace at [ a ] selected temperature values within a temperature range from 370 degrees Centigrade to about 1300 degrees Centigrade by soaking the stabilized fiber starting material at the selected temperature for the predetermined period of time to provide a [ desired ] preselected known volume electrical resistivity to the partially carbonized fibers corresponding to that volume electrical resistivity value required to provide the preselected desired surface resistance value for the finished sheet products , and thereafter processing the partially carbonized fibers into [ desired electrical resistivity ] homogeneous carbon fiber sheet products [ having the form of non-woven paper or woven or knitted fabric sheet products ] having the preselected desired surface electrical [ resistivities ] resistances . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The CFC held that the original patent did `` not support the elimination of the oxidation and stabilization step '' from the reissued claims , and that this rendered the claims `` invalid for lack of written description . '' CFC Op . at *20-21 . The CFC explained that the reissue `` impermissibly broadens the patented process by reducing the number of steps required for infringement . '' Id . at *21 . The CFC stated that `` although the step is found in the reissue patent , its elimination from the claimed process goes beyond the written description of the invention in the original ¡¬395 patent . '' Id . at n. 10 ( emphasis in original ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The elimination of the preparation of the starting material broadened the reissue . However , a broadening reissue is not improper if filed within two years of issuance . A patentee is entitled to a reissue `` enlarging the scope of the claims , '' when , as here , the reissue application is filed `` within two years from the grant of the original patent . '' 35 U.S.C . ¡± 251 ( d ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The CFC also held that the broadened claim is not supported in the specification , holding that it is irrelevant that the omitted oxidizing and stabilizing step is fully described in the specification as well as being in the prior art . The CFC held that the preparation of the known starting material must be included in the claim , that it is insufficient that the reissue claim requires that these steps be performed , and that whether these steps were known to the prior art is `` irrelevant to the question of whether the written description requirement is satisfied . '' CFC Op . at *19 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ There was no argument as to insufficiency of either the prior art or the content of the specification , in describing the starting material . There was no allegation that a person of ordinary skill in this field would not understand the description in the specification . The original specification plainly , and without dispute , describes that the starting material is an oxidized and stabilized fiber , cites references showing this known material , and describes its preparation . That a previously oxidized and stabilized starting material was known to a person of ordinary skill in the field was recognized by the reissue Examiner in his statement that : _NEWLINE_ Ex [ amine ] r agreed with applicant that partial oxidation & heat stabilization temp . need not be recited in the claims since this temp . is within the prior art & *1308 claims do not have to recite what is well known in the prior art . _NEWLINE_ Examiner Interview Summary , Reissue Application No . 07/483,531 ( May 5 , 1992 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The CFC had previously construed the reissue claims as supported by the specification , finding that the reissue claims were substantially the same as in the parent patent and properly supported . The court stated : _NEWLINE_ [ I ] t can hardly be said that the oxidizing and stabilizing step was removed from Reissue ¡¬162 . On the contrary , when the step was removed the examiner rejected the application until Zoltek added `` previously '' in the claims to refer back to this description of the method which requires it unless a previously oxidized and stabilized material is purchased . _NEWLINE_ Opinion on Defendant 's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on Matters Relating to Reissue filed on January 15 , 1999 , No . 96-166 C ( Fed.Cl . Sept. 13 , 1999 ) ( unpublished ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The government argues that the asserted claims are not supported in the specification because the specification does not state that these steps need not be performed by the same entity . The question of who performs steps of a fully described invention , including preparation of a known starting material , is not a matter of the written description requirement . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The purpose of the written description requirement is to assure that the public receives sufficient knowledge of the patented technology , and to demonstrate that the patentee is in possession of the invention claimed . See In re Skvorecz , 580 F.3d 1262 , 1269 ( Fed.Cir.2009 ) . The requirement is applied in the context of the state of knowledge at the time of the invention . Capon v. Eshhar , 418 F.3d 1349 , 1358 ( Fed.Cir.2005 ) . The written description `` need not include information that is already known and available to the experienced public . '' Space Sys./Loral , Inc. v. Lockheed Martin Corp. , 405 F.3d 985 , 987 ( Fed.Cir.2005 ) ; see Enzo Biochem , Inc. v. Gen-Probe Inc. , 323 F.3d 956 , 970 ( Fed.Cir.2002 ) ( `` [ The written ] description is the quid pro quo of the patent system ; the public must receive meaningful disclosure in exchange for being excluded from practicing the invention for a limited period of time. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Here , the ¡¬162 specification describes the preparation of the starting material , and states that it is commercially available . ¡¬162 patent , col.4 ll.45-55 ( `` [ T ] he carbonizable tow is supplied to an oxidation operation 14 where it is stabilized by being heated in atmospheric oxygen to a temperature of about 220 degrees Centigrade ... . The resulting oxidized tow is sold under the trademark 'PYRON . ' `` ) . The government does not argue that a person of ordinary skill would not be able to make or acquire the starting material based on the description in the specification . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The written description requirement relates to whether the patentee possessed the invention that is claimed . There was no suggestion that a person of ordinary skill would not have understood that Boyd was in possession of the invention that he claimed . See Centocor Ortho Biotech , Inc. v. Abbott Labs. , 636 F.3d 1341 , 1348 ( Fed.Cir.2011 ) ( `` To satisfy the written description requirement , the applicant must convey with reasonable clarity to those skilled in the art that , as of the filing date sought , he or she was in possession of the invention , and demonstrate that by disclosure in the specification of the patent . '' ) ( internal quotation marks omitted ) ; see also Alcon Research Ltd. v. Barr Labs. , Inc. , 745 F.3d 1180 , 1191-92 ( Fed.Cir.2014 ) ( `` Critically , Barr adduced no evidence , let alone clear and convincing evidence , that was probative *1309 of whether an ordinarily skilled artisan would not have understood from the disclosures of Alcon 's ... patents that the patentees invented , or possessed , the methods of the asserted claims . Without that evidence , there was no basis on which to find a lack of adequate written description. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The CFC stated its concern that the reissue patent claims could be infringed by an entity that did not itself make the starting material , but purchased the known starting material from a commercial source . However , the reissue statute provides that reissue is available `` by reason of the patentee claiming more or less than he had a right to claim ... for the invention disclosed in the original patent . '' 35 U.S.C . ¡± 251 ( a ) . A validly obtained reissue does not violate the written description requirement if the patentee can reach an enlarged scope of possible infringement . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ It is not an improper broadening amendment when a reissue applicant , with the considered agreement of the reissue Examiner , substitutes a preparatory step known to those skilled in the art at the time of the invention with a requirement to start with the product of that known preparatory step . The CFC 's emphasis on who might infringe the broadened reissue claims is an issue of infringement , not written description . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We conclude that the CFC erred in holding reissue claims 1-22 and 33-38 invalid for failure to meet the written description requirement of section 112 . That ruling is reversed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ II _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Obviousness _NEWLINE_ The science of carbonized fiber materials had been the subject of study well before the Boyd patent application was filed , as exemplified in the references cited during patent prosecution and in these proceedings . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The CFC relied on the government 's expert Dr. Sullivan , who cited references concerning carbon fiber products and developed a mathematical formula from which he generated a graph duplicating that in Figure 4 of the ¡¬162 patent . To produce this graph , Dr. Sullivan used data from the ¡¬162 patent record , from a Zoltek publication issued in 2000 , and various references and articles . He cited : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ [ 1 ] Akio Shindo , Studies on Graphite Fiber , Government Industrial Research Institute of Osaka ( 1961 ) , is a research report discusses the manufacture and use of carbon fibers of polyacrylonitrile . Shindo states that increasing heat-treatment temperature of the fiber results in increased conductivity of the fiber . Shindo does not show or suggest the non-linear relationship between temperature and resistivity that was discovered by Boyd , or the use of such relationship to control surface resistivity . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ [ 2 ] Kitago , U.S. Patent No . 3,998,689 ( Dec. 21 , 1976 ) , describes the production of carbon fiber sheets by a process that combines chopped carbon fibers with other ingredients to form a slurry , which is shaped into a sheet , saturated with a resin , and then carbonized , to form a conductive sheet product . Kitago provides data for sheets carbonized at 1000¢XC and 2000¢XC , showing significantly lower resistivity at the higher temperature . Kitago does not show or suggest the non-linear relationship discovered by Boyd , or the use of such relationship to control surface resistivity . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ [ 3 ] Layden , U.S. Patent No . 4,080,413 ( Mar . 21 , 1978 ) , shows carbonization of chopped polyacrylonitrile fiber sheets over the range of 1000¢XC to 1260¢XC , to produce hard , inflexible products with extremely *1310 low surface resistivities , suitable for use as fuel cell electrodes . Layden does not show or suggest the non-linear relationship discovered by Boyd , or the use of such relationship to control surface resistivity . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ [ 4 ] Topchjiev , U.K. Patent No . 979,122 ( Jan. 1 , 1965 ) , entitled `` Method of Producing Semiconductive Polymer Materials , '' uses oxidized and stabilized carbon fibers that are heat treated to produce materials with semiconductor properties electrical conductivity . Topchjiev does not show or suggest the non-linear relationship discovered by Boyd , or the use of such relationship to control surface resistivity . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ [ 5 ] D.B . Fischbach & Kunio Komaki , Electrical Resistance of Carbon Fibers , University of Washington ( 1979 ) , is an article that explains that increasing the treatment temperature results in decreased volume resistivity . This article does not show or suggest the non-linear relationship discovered by Boyd , or the use of such relationship to control surface resistivity . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ These references variously show the heat treatment of carbonized fibers and their resistivities or conductivities at various treatment temperatures . On cross-examination , Dr. Sullivan agreed that these references alone do not establish obviousness . The following exchange took place : _NEWLINE_ Q . And the Fischbach and Komaki article ... the Topchjiev patent ... the Layden patent ... all disclose nothing more than what was disclosed in the Otani reference before the Patent Office , correct ? _NEWLINE_ A. I believe that is correct , yes . _NEWLINE_ Q . And I believe it 's also your testimony-prior testimony that the Topchjiev patent and the Layden patent , by themselves , would not be sufficient to render the Zoltek patent obvious , correct ? _NEWLINE_ A . Yes , I think that is correct . _NEWLINE_ Trial Tr . 269:5-15 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Instead , Dr. Sullivan relied on a mathematical formula he derived from the Rule of Mixtures,2 citing several articles , viz. , `` Theory of Reinforced Materials '' by Z. Hashin ( 1972 ) , `` Analysis of Composite Materials-A Survey '' by Z. Hashin ( 1981 ) , `` An Analysis Model for Spatially Oriented Fiber Composites '' by B.W . Rosen et al . ( 1977 ) , and `` Mechanics of Composite Materials '' by R. Christensen ( 1979 ) . The position of Dr. Sullivan was summarized at trial as follows : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Q. : So , to sum up your testimony , Dr. Sullivan , you 're asserting that it would be obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art , as of October 1984 , to rely upon four publications which do not mention surface resistivity , partially carbonized or semi-conductive carbon fibers , or the method to control the surface resistivity of carbon fiber sheet products made from the-made from the partially carbonized fibers and controlling the volume resistivity of the partially carbonized fiber , the 1972 Hashin and the 1977 Rosen articles referring to structural fibers , that it would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art , as of October of 1984 , to construct the mathematical methodology you described on your direct examination to obtain carbon fiber sheet products having a controlled surface resistivity ? _NEWLINE_ [ Objection ] _NEWLINE_ THE COURT : ... . do you want the question broken out or- _NEWLINE_ *1311 THE WITNESS : No , because that is my testimony . _NEWLINE_ Trial Tr . 245:12-246:8 . _NEWLINE_ No reference mentions `` surface resistivity '' or `` the required limitation to pre-select individual fiber volume resistivities to produce sheet products with desired surface resistivities . '' Zoltek Br . 4-5 ( citing record ) . Dr. Sullivan testified that he was not aware of anyone , including himself , who had previously used the mathematical formula he created to determine carbonization temperature-resistivity relationships . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The ¡¬162 patent teaches carbonized sheets that `` require no insulating elements such as glass fiber in order to adjust the surface resistances of the sheet product to a desired surface resistance volume . '' T62 patent , col.2 ll.7-11 . The novelty of such sheets was not disputed . The patent prosecution and trial records contain a letter from George Rodgers , a materials engineer at Northrop Grumman ( the general contractor for the B-2 Bomber ) , who stated : _NEWLINE_ In December 1983 , the Material & Processes Department of Northrop Advanced Systems Division ordered four rolls of carbon fiber paper from Stackpole Fibers Co . The product was unique in that the carbon fibers were not fully carbonized , increasing the volume resistivity of the fiber which in turn increases the surface resistivity of the paper ... . At the time the order was placed , Northrop Materials & Processes had never seen a material of this type before and was not aware of any other company that could supply material in this form with varying electrical properties . _NEWLINE_ Letter from George Rodgers dated August 6 , 1987 , Prosecution File Wrapper 187 . By deposition on August 18 , 2009 , Mr. Rodgers testified that , with regard to the accuracy of the contents of that letter , viewed in hindsight , `` I would n't change anything . '' Rogers Dep . 34:6 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Dr. Sullivan also testified that he had no basis to disagree with the Rodgers letter . Specifically , he testified : _NEWLINE_ Q . Okay . And the last sentence reads , `` At the time the order was placed , Northrop Materials & Processes had never seen a material of this type and were not aware of any other company that could supply material in this form with varying electrical properties . '' Do you see that ? _NEWLINE_ A. I do . _NEWLINE_ Q . Okay . And you have no basis to disagree with that statement , do you ? _NEWLINE_ A . No , I do n't . _NEWLINE_ Trial Tr . 274:16-25 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ There is no teaching or suggestion in the prior art to select the data that Sullivan selected , and to plug the selected data into the mathematical equation that Sullivan devised . As summarized by Zoltek , `` Sullivan used the variable fiber volume resistivities shown [ in ] the file history of the ¡¬395 parent patent at various temperatures and constant volume resistivities for each remaining component of the sheet products in making his calculations . '' Zoltek Br . 23 ( citing record ) . This is not evidence of obviousness . See EWP Corp. v. Reliance Universal , Inc. , 755 F.2d 898 , 907 ( Fed.Cir.1985 ) ( `` Patentability under the statute , ¡± 103 , is a decision made on the basis of a hypothesis : Would the invention have been obvious 'to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which the subject matter pertains ' in the light of all knowledge conveyed by 'prior art ' as defined by statute and case law. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Zoltek also points to several errors made by Dr. Sullivan , to which Sullivan admitted on cross-examination . Zoltek mentions `` Sullivan 's erroneous fiber volume fraction ( 0.3 ) , fiber density ( 1.81 g/cm3 *1312 ) , and resin volume fraction ( 0.54 ) . '' Zoltek Br . 24 n.5 . With respect to Dr. Sullivan 's testimony that he used a volume fraction of 0.3 in his Rule of Mixtures calculation purportedly reflective of the Zoltek patented product , Zoltek 's expert Mr. Rumy testified : _NEWLINE_ In the paper process , you ca n't even make that kind of conduct-that kind of concentration of carbon fibers , only possibly by taking a regular paper product that is made probably no more than 10 to 15 percent carbon content , and then you compress it . But we-that's-that would be destroying our entire invention . _NEWLINE_ Trial Tr . 326:22-327:2 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As another error , while the Rule of Mixtures requires the use of volume fractions of each component of a composite mixture , Dr. Sullivan used a weight percent for each component in order to place data points on the Figure 4 template . See Zoltek Br . 28 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ These errors taint Dr. Sullivan 's reproduction of Figure 4 . Indeed , Dr. Sullivan made several confessions of error in his selection or calculation of data points to produce the graph he created to track Figure 4 . As another example : _NEWLINE_ Q ... . So , you 've inserted a uniform density of 1.81 grams per cubic centimeter , which is the density of fully carbonized fibers , when there should have been a gradually increasing density from 1.36 through the temperature range shown on [ your spreadsheet ] , correct ? _NEWLINE_ [ Objection for lack of foundation ; overruled ] _NEWLINE_ A . It is true that the carbon fiber density will change with heat treatment temperature and that it probably is true that a different value , other than a uniform 1.81 , would have been more appropriate _NEWLINE_ Q . Okay . _NEWLINE_ A. I will concede that . _NEWLINE_ Trial Tr . 257:2-19 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Zoltek also points to Dr. Sullivan 's admission that his critical fiber volume fraction , 0.3 % /30 % , fundamental to his calculations based on the Rule of Mixtures , was wrong and that Dr. Sullivan used data from a 2000 Zoltek User 's Guide directed to fully carbonized composites at a temperature of 1400¢XC , a reference published fourteen years after the ¡¬162 patent 's filing date . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Dr. Sullivan conceded that there were errors in his calculations , stating that the reason was that he did not have complete information . That is not surprising , for there was not complete information in the prior art-weighing against the government 's argument that it would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill to recreate the Boyd graph from known information . Dr. Sullivan 's plaint that he could not accurately duplicate Boyd 's discovery because of lack of information is powerful evidence of non-obviousness-not the contrary . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Dr. Sullivan stated that he obtained some of the values he used in his calculations from the ¡¬162 patent itself . However , for the volume fraction of carbon fiber , described by Dr. Sullivan as by far the most important element in the equation , he ignored the figure in the patent ( 0.83 ) and used a value of 0.3 , which he testified came from a Zoltek 2000 User 's Guide . Zoltek points out that this Guide was directed to an entirely different product , and also that the Guide was written fourteen years after the ¡¬162 patent application was filed . There was no showing that the information on which Dr. Sullivan relied was available to persons of skill at the time of the Boyd invention . Zoltek states , and Dr. Sullivan did not contradict , that Dr. Sullivan selected *1313 values from various sources in order to fit the template of Boyd 's results . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Neither the government 's attorney argument , nor Dr. Sullivan 's testimony , nor the opinion of the Court of Federal Claims , points to any suggestion in the prior art to select the data selected by Dr. Sullivan and create the mathematical formula to construct a graph to track Figure 4 . See KSR Int ' l Co. v. Teleflex , Inc. , 550 U.S. 398 , 418-19 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 , 167 L.Ed.2d 705 ( 2007 ) ( `` Although common sense directs one to look with care at a patent application that claims as innovation the combination of two known devices according to their established functions , it can be important to identify a reason that would have prompted a person of ordinary skill in the relevant field to combine the elements in the way the claimed new invention does . This is so because inventions in most , if not all , instances rely upon building blocks long since uncovered , and claimed discoveries almost of necessity will be combinations of what , in some sense , is already known. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Even Dr. Sullivan called his reconstruction of Figure 4 `` somewhat arbitrary . '' Trial Tr . 259:18 . Hindsight reconstruction for litigation ends is not of probative value . See Outside the Box Innovations , LLC v. Travel Caddy , Inc. , 695 F.3d 1285 , 1298 ( Fed.Cir.2012 ) ( `` Precedent recognizes the pitfalls of judicial hindsight exercised at the time of litigation ... . '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Court has recognized `` the distortion caused by hindsight bias '' and `` arguments reliant upon ex post reasoning '' in determining obviousness . KSR , 550 U.S. at 421 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 ; see InTouch Technologies , Inc. v. VGO Commc'ns , Inc. , 751 F.3d 1327 , 1351 ( Fed.Cir.2014 ) ( `` It appears that [ the expert ] relied on the ... patent itself as her roadmap for putting what she referred to as pieces of a jigsaw puzzle ' together . `` ) ; W.L .

Garlock , Inc. , 721 F.2d 1540 , 1553 ( Fed.Cir.1983 ) ( `` To imbue one of ordinary skill in the art with knowledge of the invention in suit , when no prior art reference or references of record convey or suggest that knowledge , is to fall victim to the insidious effect of a hindsight syndrome wherein that which only the inventor taught is used against its teacher. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The government does not attempt to rehabilitate Dr. Sullivan 's errors . Instead , the government 's argument appears to be that since Dr. Sullivan is a renowned scientist in this held , and since Dr. Sullivan was able to reproduce the Figure 4 graph , it was obvious to do so . This was error , since , as we have repeatedly cautioned , `` [ t ] hat which may be made clear and thus 'obvious ' to a court , with the invention fully diagrammed and aided ... by experts in the held , may have been a break-through of substantial dimension when first unveiled .

John Deere Co. , 383 U.S. 1 , 36 , 86 S.Ct . 684 , 15 L.Ed.2d 545 ( 1966 ) as `` warning against a temptation to read into the prior art the teachings of the invention in issue and instructing courts to guard against slipping into use of hindsight '' ) ( internal quotation marks omitted ) ; W.L .

'' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ There was not clear and convincing evidence of obviousness of the Boyd discovery and its use to produce carbon fiber sheets of pre-selected homogeneous electrical resistance . The CFC 's ruling of invalidity on the ground of obviousness is reversed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ CONCLUSION _NEWLINE_ The Court of Federal Claims erred in holding the asserted claims of the ¡¬ 162 patent invalid under sections 103 and 112 .

Chiron Corp. v. Genentech , Inc. , No . Civ . S-00-1252 WBS GGH ( Sept. 9 & Oct. 23 , 2002 ) . Because Chiron did not adequately disclose or support the subject matter of its ¡¬561 patent in its 1984 , 1985 , or 1986 applications , this court affirms the district court 's denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law ( JMOL ) and motion for a new trial . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I . _NEWLINE_ The ¡¬561 patent claims particular monoclonal antibodies . Specifically , independent claim 19 states:1 `` A monoclonal antibody that binds to human c-erbB-2 antigen . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ According to modern understanding , a monoclonal antibody is a composition with a homogeneous antibody population . An antibody is a protein generated by the immune system that is capable of recognizing and binding to a specific antigen . Described in terms of its structure , an antibody is a Y-shaped protein consisting of four amino acid chains , two heavy and two light . In a simplified model sufficient for this appeal , each antibody has primarily two regions : a variable region and a constant region . The variable region , located on the ends of the arms of the Y , binds to and interacts with the target antigen . This variable region includes a complementary determining region ( CDR ) that recognizes and binds to a specific binding site on a particular antigen . The constant region , located on the tail of the Y , is recognized by and interacts with the immune system . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A target antigen generally has numerous binding sites , also called epitopes , recognized by CDRs on multiple antibodies . Each antibody that specifically binds to a different epitope has a different structure . Thus , one antigen may have more than one corresponding antibody . In this case , claim 19 of the ¡¬ 561 patent reads on monoclonal antibodies that bind to human c-erbB-2 antigen ( also named HER2 ) -an antigen associated with breast cancer cells . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ There are various methods of producing monoclonal antibodies . One method uses hybridoma technology , which refers to a cloned cell line that produces a single type of antibody . The hybridoma method uses the cells of various species , including mice , hamsters , rats , and humans . Murine antibodies-derived from mouse cells-are particularly important for this invention . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Another method uses genetic engineering including recombinant DNA techniques . Monoclonal antibodies made from these techniques include , among others , chimeric antibodies and humanized antibodies . A chimeric antibody combines DNA encoding regions from more than one type of species . For example , a chimeric antibody may derive the variable region from a mouse and the constant region from a human . A humanized antibody comes predominantly from a human , even though it contains nonhuman portions . Like a chimeric antibody , a humanized antibody may contain a completely human constant region . But unlike a chimeric antibody , the variable region may be partially derived from a human . The nonhuman , *1251 synthetic portions of a humanized antibody often come from CDRs in murine antibodies . In any event , these regions are crucial to allow the antibody to recognize and bind to a specific antigen . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As noted , murine antibodies play an important role in these technologies . While useful for diagnostics and short-term therapies , murine antibodies can not be administered to people long-term without increasing the risk of a deleterious immunogenic response . This response , called Human Anti-Mouse Antibody ( HAMA ) , occurs when a human immune system recognizes the murine antibody as foreign and attacks it . A HAMA response can cause toxic shock or even death . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Chimeric and humanized antibodies reduce the likelihood of a HAMA response by minimizing the nonhuman portions of administered antibodies . Furthermore , chimeric and humanized antibodies have the additional benefit of activating secondary human immune responses , such as antibody dependent cellular cytoxicity . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In the early 1980s , scientists at Chiron 's predecessor corporation , Cetus Corp. , ( collectively , Chiron ) began investigating monoclonal antibodies that target human breast cancer antigens . As noted above , the antigen that facilitates diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer was eventually named HER2 . This investigational work led to a series of patent applications . The inventors filed their first application on February 8 , 1984 . Within a year , on January 11 , 1985 , they filed a continuation-in-part ( CIP ) application claiming priority based on that first 1984 application . The inventors filed another CIP application on May 21 , 1986 . Eventually , the application that led to the ¡¬ 561 patent was filed as another CIP on June 7 , 1995 . This appeal focuses on the ¡¬561 patent 's claims to priority based on the applications filed in 1984 , 1985 , and 1986 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The 1984 application discloses one monoclonal antibody ( 454C11 ) that binds to HER2 . The 454C11 is a murine antibody produced by the hybridoma method . While the application discloses the deposit of the hybridoma that produced the monoclonal antibody , the application does not identify the structure , function , or molecular weight of the antigen . Because the first publication that disclosed chimeric antibody technology did not appear until four months after this filing , it is not surprising that the 1984 application does not disclose any chimeric antibodies . Similarly , the first publication to disclose humanized antibodies appeared in May 1986 . Thus , for good reason , this 1984 application also does not mention any humanized antibodies . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The 1985 application discloses six additional monoclonal antibodies that bind to HER2 , all of which are murine antibodies . The disclosure also refers to the deposit of an additional hybridoma for one of these monoclonal antibodies , 520C9 . While the application provides an approximate antigen molecular weight of 210 kilodaltons,2 the application does not describe the identity , structure , or function of the antigen . The application does , however , note that six of the seven antibodies likely bind to the same epitope . By the time of this application , chimeric antibody technology was known in this art field . Although the application does not specifically disclose chimeric or humanized antibodies , it adds the following disclosure : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As used herein the term `` monoclonal antibody '' means an antibody composition having a homogeneous antibody population . It is not intended to be limited as regards the source of the *1252 antibody or the manner in which it is made . _NEWLINE_ The 1986 application discloses six additional murine antibodies that bind to HER2 and the deposit for three additional hybridomas . Thus , this application discloses a total of thirteen murine antibodies and deposits for five of their corresponding hybridomas , including those corresponding to 454C11 and 520C9 . The application discloses that these antibodies likely bind to at least three different epitopes on HER2 . Although still not identifying the antigen by name , the application discloses that its molecular weight is approximately 200 kilodaltons . Although the 1986 application makes no specific mention of chimeric or humanized antibodies , it quotes again the statement that the term monoclonal antibody `` is not intended to be limited as regards the source of the antibody or the manner in which it is made . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ When the ¡¬561 patent issued , Chiron sued Genentech over sales of Herceptin ( r ) , a humanized antibody useful for the long-term treatment of breast cancer . Herceptin binds to the HER2 antigen and thus inhibits the growth of cancerous cells . Because Herceptin is a humanized antibody , it minimizes any HAMA response in patients . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Before trial , the district court broadly construed the claims of the ¡¬561 patent to embrace chimeric and humanized antibodies in addition to the murine antibodies that bind to HER2 . Chiron Corp. v. Genentech , Inc. , 266 F.Supp.2d 1172 ( E.D.Cal.2002 ) . Accordingly , the district court subsequently granted Chiron 's motion for partial summary judgment of infringement . Chiron Corp. v. Genentech , Inc. , No . Civ . S-00-1252 WBS GGH , 2002 U.S. Dist . LEXIS 19126 , 2002 WL 32123930 ( E.D.Cal . June 24 , 2002 ) . Also before trial , the parties stipulated that the ¡¬561 patent would be invalid under ¡± 102 based on intervening prior art if the patent were not entitled to claim priority to the filing date of any one of the 1984 , 1985 , and 1986 applications . Thus , the thirteen-day jury trial adjudicated only whether any of the priority applications satisfy the written description and enablement requirements of 35 U.S.C . ¡± 112 , first paragraph . Specifically the trial determined whether the 1980s applications adequately disclosed , and thus supported , the claim to chimeric and humanized antibodies claimed in the ¡¬561 patent ( with its filing date in 1995 ) . The jury determined that Genentech proved by clear and convincing evidence that none of the applications satisfy both the written description and the enablement requirement for the subject matter in the ¡¬ 561 patent 's claims . The verdict form , however , did not require the jury to specify the particular requirement of ¡± 112 left unfulfilled by each disclosure of the priority applications . After trial , the district court denied Chiron 's motions for JMOL and a new trial . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Chiron appeals the denial of its post-trial motions , and Genentech conditionally `` cross-appeals '' the district court 's claim construction . Although styled as a cross-appeal , this court treats this claim construction issue as an alternative ground for affirming the judgment . A cross-appeal is only proper if `` a party seeks to enlarge its own rights under the judgment or to lessen the rights of its adversary under the judgment . '' Bailey v. Dart Container Corp. of Mich. , 292 F.3d 1360 , 1362 ( Fed.Cir.2002 ) . This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C . ¡± 1295 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ II . _NEWLINE_ A trial court should grant a motion for JMOL if substantial evidence does not support the jury 's factual findings , presumed or express , or if those factual findings can not support the legal conclusions implied from the jury 's verdict . Kearns v. *1253 Chrysler Corp. , 32 F.3d 1541 , 1547-48 ( Fed.Cir.1994 ) . This court reviews a district court 's denial of a JMOL motion without deference . Sextant Avionique , S.A. v. Analog Devices , Inc. , 172 F.3d 817 , 824 ( Fed.Cir.1999 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Section 120 of title 35 provides : `` An application for patent for an invention disclosed in the manner provided by the first paragraph of section 112 of this title in an application previously filed in the United States ... shall have the same effect , as to such invention , as though filed on the date of the prior application . '' Accordingly , the ¡¬561 patent may only claim priority to an earlier application if the earlier application fulfills the requirements of ¡± 112 , first paragraph . In turn , that paragraph requires , in part , that the application `` shall contain a written description of the invention , and of the manner and process of making and using it , in such full , clear , concise , and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains , or with which it is most nearly connected , to make and use the same . '' 35 U.S.C . ¡± 112 , ? 1 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This court has interpreted this passage as setting forth two requirements : written description and enablement . Amgen Inc. v. Hoechst Marion Roussel , Inc. , 314 F.3d 1313 , 1330 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) . As explained further below , this court affirms because neither the 1985 nor the 1986 application enables the claims of the ¡¬561 patent . The 1984 application does not support the new matter added to the ¡¬561 patent and thus does not satisfy the written description requirement . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Whether the earlier applications enable the claims of the ¡¬561 patent is a question of law based on underlying facts . In re Wands , 858 F.2d 731 , 735 ( Fed.Cir.1988 ) . This court reviews the underlying factual findings for clear error and the legal component of enablement without deference . Plant Genetic Sys . N.V. v. DeKalb Genetics Corp. , 315 F.3d 1335 , 1339 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) . Because the ¡¬561 patent is presumed valid , clear and convincing evidence must support a conclusion of invalidity . See 35 U.S.C . ¡± 282 ; Hybritech Inc. v. Monoclonal Antibodies , Inc. , 802 F.2d 1367 , 1375 ( Fed.Cir.1986 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The applications in this case satisfy the enablement requirement only if one skilled in the art , after reading their disclosures , could practice the invention claimed in the ¡¬561 patent without undue experimentation . Wands , 858 F.2d at 736-37 . `` But the question of undue experimentation is a matter of degree . The fact that some experimentation is necessary does not preclude enablement ; what is required is that the amount of experimentation 'must not be unduly extensive . ' `` PPG Indus. , Inc. v. Guardian Indus. , Corp. , 75 F.3d 1558 , 1564 ( Fed.Cir.1996 ) ( quoting Atlas Powder Co. v. E.I . du Pont De Nemours & Co. , 750 F.2d 1569 , 1576 ( Fed.Cir.1984 ) ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Moreover , the prior application must enable one of ordinary skill in the art to practice `` the full scope of the claimed invention . '' In re Wright , 999 F.2d 1557 , 1561 ( Fed.Cir.1993 ) . Clarifying this principle , this court has explained : `` That is not to say that the specification itself must necessarily describe how to make and use every possible variant of the claimed invention , for the artisan 's knowledge of the prior art and routine experimentation can often fill gaps , interpolate between embodiments , and perhaps even extrapolate beyond the disclosed embodiments , depending upon the predictability of the art . '' AK Steel Corp. v. Sollac , 344 F.3d 1234 , 1244 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) . Thus , `` [ t ] he enabling disclosure of the specification [ must ] be commensurate in scope with the claim under consideration . '' In re Hyatt , 708 F.2d 712 , 714 ( Fed.Cir.1983 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1254 Whether the earlier applications enable the claims of the ¡¬ 561 patent is determined as of the filing date of each application . See Plant Genetic Sys. , 315 F.3d at 1339 . As noted above , a patent disclosure need not enable information within the knowledge of an ordinarily skilled artisan . Thus , a patentee preferably omits from the disclosure any routine technology that is well known at the time of application . See Hybritech , 802 F.2d at 1384 . At the other end of the knowledge continuum , a patent document can not enable technology that arises after the date of application . The law does not expect an applicant to disclose knowledge invented or developed after the filing date . Such disclosure would be impossible . See In re Hogan , 559 F.2d 595 , 605-06 ( CCPA 1977 ) . Nascent technology , however , must be enabled with a `` specific and useful teaching . '' Genentech , Inc. v. Novo Nordisk , A/S , 108 F.3d 1361 , 1368 ( Fed.Cir.1997 ) . The law requires an enabling disclosure for nascent technology because a person of ordinary skill in the art has little or no knowledge independent from the patentee 's instruction . Thus , the public 's end of the bargain struck by the patent system is a full enabling disclosure of the claimed technology . See , e.g. , J.E.M . AG Supply , Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred Int ' l , Inc. , 534 U.S. 124 , 142 , 122 S.Ct . 593 , 604 , 151 L.Ed.2d 508 ( 2001 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ `` Because a patent specification must enable the full scope of a claimed invention , an enablement inquiry typically begins with a construction of the claims . '' AK Steel , 344 F.3d at 1241 ( citation omitted ) . In this case , neither party challenges the district court 's claim construction in the first instance . As a precaution , Genentech posits a `` cross-appeal '' on claim construction in the event this court reverses the denials of Chiron 's post-trial motions . Because Genentech 's arguments regarding claim construction are alternative grounds for affirming the verdict , Bailey , 292 F.3d 1360 , this court proceeds on the premise that the claim construction is correct . The district court 's claim construction reads the claims of the ¡¬561 patent to embrace not only murine antibodies but also chimeric and humanized antibodies that bind to HER2 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ At the outset , this court focuses primarily on chimeric antibodies . If the applications in this case do not enable or provide new matter support for chimeric antibodies , this court need not proceed to examine humanized antibodies . The trial record shows that genetically engineered antibodies , specifically chimeric antibodies , first appeared as a successful technology in the literature of this art field in May 1984 , four months after the February filing date of the first application . Because the first publication documenting the successful creation of chimeric antibodies occurred after the filing of the 1984 application , this sequence of events shows that this new technology arose after the filing date and thus was , by definition , outside the bounds of the enablement requirement . See Hogan , 559 F.2d at 605-06 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court in this case attempted to justify the jury 's enablement verdict on the basis that the 1984 applicants might have known about chimeric antibodies before the initial publication on that subject . The trial court cited speculative testimony in the trial about the hypothetical possibility that information may leak out in advance of an initial publication on an important academic topic . At no point did the record show that Chiron scientists actually knew of chimeric antibodies before their filing , only that it was hypothetically possible for them to have acquired some advance knowledge . Even if the record shows that scientists routinely discuss their work with others in the same art field before publication , ethics would suggest impropriety in publishing that information *1255 in advance of the actual originator of the ideas . In any event , as noted , the enablement requirement does not extend to technology that arises after the time of filing . Plant Genetic Sys. , 315 F.3d at 1340-41 . In sum , the district court erred to the extent that it attempted to create an obligation for Chiron scientists to enable nonexistent technology in the 1984 filing . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In the context of the 1984 application , the trial court and this court need not rely on enablement to support the jury 's verdict . The jury may have found that the 1984 application does not provide any support for the new matter , chimeric antibodies , claimed in the ¡¬561 patent . Because chimeric antibody technology did not even exist at the time of the 1984 filing , the record conclusively supports that the Chiron scientists did not possess and disclose this technology in the February 1984 filing . See Union Oil Co. of Cal . v. Atl . Richfield Co. , 208 F.3d 989 , 998 ( Fed.Cir.2000 ) ( A jury determined `` that , as of the filing date , the inventor conveyed with reasonable clarity to those of skill in the art that he was in possession of the subject matter of the claims. '' ) . Thus , the ¡¬561 patent can not claim priority based on the 1984 application because it fails to comply with the written description requirement . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The written description requirement prevents applicants from using the amendment process to update their disclosures ( claims or specifications ) during their pendency before the patent office . Otherwise applicants could add new matter to their disclosures and date them back to their original filing date , thus defeating an accurate accounting of the priority of invention . See 35 U.S.C . 132 . Priority is always a vital issue in patent prosecution procedures-often determining entitlement to an invention . In 1967 , this courts predecessor began to enforce priority as a component of the 35 U.S.C . 112 , first paragraph , written description requirement . In re Ruschig , 54 C.C.P.A . 1551 , 379 F.2d 990 ( 1967 ) . In the context of a new claim added `` [ a ] bout a year after the present application was filed , '' the Ruschig court sought to determine `` whether [ the new ] claim 13 is supported by the disclosure of appellants ' application . '' Id . at 991 . As later explained , `` [ t ] he function of the description requirement is to ensure that the inventor had possession , as of the filing date of the application relied on , of the specific subject matter later claimed by him . '' In re Wertheim , 541 F.2d 257 , 262 ( CCPA 1976 ) . In this case , the Chiron scientists , by definition , could not have possession of , and disclose , the subject matter of chimeric antibodies that did not even exist at the time of the 1984 application . Thus , axiomatically , Chiron can not satisfy the written description requirement for the new matter appearing in the 561 patent , namely chimeric antibodies . See , e.g. , In re Kaslow , 707 F.2d 1366 , 1375 ( Fed.Cir.1983 ) ( `` The test for determining compliance with the written description requirement is whether the disclosure of the application as originally filed reasonably conveys to the artisan that the inventor had possession at that time of the later claimed subject matter , rather than the presence or absence of literal support in the specification for the claim language . '' ( citation omitted ) ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Turning next to the 1985 and 1986 applications , this court examines compliance with the enablement requirement . For these applications , the jury was entitled to determine as a matter of fact that chimeric antibodies were not future technology , but were nascent technology requiring a `` specific and useful teaching . '' Genentech , 108 F.3d at 1368 . This question , in turn , depends on evidence that undue experimentation would be required to make and use the chimeric antibodies claimed by the ¡¬561 patent . Of course , *1256 undue experimentation `` is not a single , simple factual determination , but rather is a conclusion reached by weighing many factual considerations . '' Wands , 858 F.2d at 737 . These factual considerations include `` ( 1 ) the quantity of experimentation necessary , ( 2 ) the amount of direction or guidance presented , ( 3 ) the presence or absence of working examples , ( 4 ) the nature of the invention , ( 5 ) the state of the prior art , ( 6 ) the relative skill of those in the art , ( 7 ) the predictability or unpredictability of the art , and ( 8 ) the breadth of the claims . '' Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Evidence presented to the jury showed that creation of genetically engineered antibodies , such as chimeric antibodies , required significant experimentation in 1985 and 1986 because those antibodies were unpredictable at that early stage of development . The record also shows that only a few laboratories contained the necessary equipment to make these new antibodies-another indication of the excessive experimentation necessary to make and use that technology at that time . The 1985 and 1986 applications provide no disclosure of either how to make and use chimeric antibodies or working examples of chimeric antibodies within the scope of the ¡¬561 patent 's claims . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Moreover , as mentioned above , `` [ t ] he enabling disclosure of the specification [ must ] be commensurate in scope with the claim under consideration . '' Hyatt , 708 F.2d at 714 . Here , the scope of the claim includes not only murine but also chimeric antibodies . While Chiron 's applications certainly enable murine antibodies , they do not enable chimeric antibodies . Although an aspect of the claimed invention included the binding of an antibody to a breast cancer antigen , Chiron 's disclosure fell short of providing a `` specific and useful teaching , '' Genentech , 108 F.3d at 1368 , of all antibodies within the scope of the claim . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ By the filing date of the 1986 application , Chiron contends that chimeric antibodies were so well known that they had become routine technology . Chiron particularly highlights a number of publications before the 1986 application that disclosed methods of making chimeric antibodies . Accordingly , Chiron argues that the 1986 application need not specifically enable chimeric antibodies , because technicians of ordinary skill in this art could make and use them by that time without undue experimentation . Substantial evidence , however , supports the jury 's implicit finding that the technology was still nascent at the time of the 1986 application ( as well as , of course , at the time of the 1985 application ) and thus would have still required undue experimentation . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In particular , Genentech 's expert , Dr. French , testified that making chimeric antibodies was not routine technology in 1985 or 1986 . Dr. French also testified that , by 1986 , only a few laboratories had the capacity and expertise necessary to make genetically engineered antibodies . Dr. Larrick , another one of Genentech 's experts , testified that polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) , a technique that facilitated the manufacture of genetically engineered antibodies including chimeric antibodies , did not become widespread until sometime between 1986 and 1988 . Although PCR is not necessary to make chimeric antibodies , PCR diminishes the difficulties associated with manufacturing genetically engineered antibodies . Furthermore , by 1989 , an article authored by a pioneer in the field described techniques of chimeric antibodies as `` obviously those of a very young and very ambitious field . '' Sherie L. Morrison , Genetically Engineered ( Chimeric ) Antibodies , 24 Hosp . Practice ( No . 10 ) 65 , 75 ( Oct. 15 , 1989 ) . The article further noted : `` We are all new to the game . '' Thus , substantial evidence supports the finding that chimeric antibodies were still a nascent technology at the time the 1985 and *1257 1986 applications were filed . Accordingly , the record amply supports the jury 's conclusion that the 1985 and 1986 applications do not enable the claims of the ¡¬561 patent without undue experimentation . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ While agreeing with the conclusion that the ¡¬561 patent may not claim priority to the 1984 application , the concurrence reads Hogan and Plant Genetic as allowing an inquiry into whether an application must enable future technology . This court can not avoid the precedent of Hogan , which is binding unless overruled en banc , by virtue of the more recent Plant Genetic . See Allergan , Inc. v. Alcon Labs. , Inc. , 324 F.3d 1322 , 1332-34 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) . But even if earlier precedent could be disregarded , this court does not read Plant Genetic to hold that an application must enable unknown , future technology . Plant Genetic states : _NEWLINE_ We do not read Hogan as allowing an inventor to claim what was specifically desired but difficult to obtain at the time the application was filed , unless the patent discloses how to make and use it . In Hogan , amorphous propylene , on the record before the court , was not known or in existence when the application was filed . In the present case , however , monocots existed in 1987 and stably-transformed monocot cells were highly desirable . PGS indeed asserts that monocot cells were already being stably transformed . Thus , monocots and stably transformed monocot cells were not an unknown concept that came into existence only after 1987 . But stably transformed monocot cells were difficult to produce , and the ¡¬236 patent gave no instruction how . _NEWLINE_ 315 F.3d at 1340 ( emphasis added ) . Thus , Plant Genetic distinguishes Hogan because stably transformed monocots were nascent technology when the application was filed , unlike the unknown and nonexistent amorphous propylene in the prior case . In the present case , chimeric antibodies , like the amorphous propylene in Hogan , did not even appear for the first time until several months after the 1984 application . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Because the ¡¬561 patent is invalid for the reasons noted above , this court need not reach the question of claim construction . This case poses a particular challenge for accurate assessment of the meaning of the claim terms . In this case , the meaning of `` monoclonal antibody '' may not have been stagnant between the earlier applications and the ¡¬561 patent . The ordinary usage of `` monoclonal antibody '' in the early 1980s was narrow . For example , one treatise defines `` monoclonal antibody '' in these narrow terms : `` Antibody secreted by a hybridoma clone . Because each such clone is derived from a single B cell , all of the antibody molecules it makes are identical . '' Bruce Alberts et al. , Molecular Biology of the Cell G-15 ( 3d ed.1994 ) ; accord Bruce Alberts et al. , Molecular Biology of the Cell 182-84 ( 1983 ) . Indeed , another textbook expressly equated `` monoclonal antibody '' with `` hybridoma antibody . '' Leroy E. Hood et al. , Immunology 20 ( 1984 ) . Thus , the term `` monoclonal antibody '' in 1984 apparently referred to antibodies made with hybridoma and was not broad enough to encompass chimeric antibodies . See Alan Munro , Uses of Chimaeric Antibodies , 312 Nature 597 ( 1984 ) ( differentiating monoclonal antibodies from chimeric antibodies ) . Accordingly , when the earliest priority application was filed , `` monoclonal antibody '' apparently referred only to a hybridoma-derived antibody . The 1984 application did not expressly redefine the term.3 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1258 The ¡¬561 patent , however , included a definition for `` monoclonal antibody '' : _NEWLINE_ The term `` antibody '' encompasses polyclonal and monoclonal antibody preparations , as well as preparations including hybrid antibodies , altered antibodies , chimeric antibodies and , [ sic ] humanized antibodies . _NEWLINE_ As used herein , the term `` monoclonal antibody '' refers to an antibody composition having a homogeneous antibody population . The term is not limited regarding the species or source of the antibody , nor is it intended to be limited by the manner in which it is made . The term encompasses whole immunoglobulins . _NEWLINE_ '561 patent , col. 8 , ll . 36-45 . Thus , the ¡¬561 patent defined `` monoclonal antibody '' to include chimeric and humanized antibodies . Still only a portion of this updated meaning of `` monoclonal antibody '' can claim priority to the earliest application . If required to engage in claim construction , therefore , this court would face a dilemma : Either construe the term according to the meaning of the earliest application but contrary to the explicit definition in the ¡¬561 patent or construe the term according to the explicit definition in the ¡¬561 patent but broader than the disclosure of the earliest application . Again , the latter alternative would run afoul of the prohibition against importing new matter into later patent documents . As noted , however , the record amply supports the jury 's verdict of invalidity without reaching this complex claim construction question . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ III . _NEWLINE_ A trial court should grant a motion for a new trial if ( 1 ) the jury instructions were erroneous or inadequate , ( 2 ) the court made incorrect and prejudicial admissibility rulings , or ( 3 ) the verdict is contrary to the great weight of the evidence . Murphy v. Long Beach , 914 F.2d 183 , 186 ( 9th Cir.1990 ) ; Chalmers v. City of Los Angeles , 762 F.2d 753 , 761 ( 9th Cir.1985 ) . Chiron asserts that it is entitled to a new trial based on the first and second avenues . This court reviews the denial of a new trial motion after a jury verdict for an abuse of discretion . Advanced Cardiovascular Sys. , Inc. v. Medtronic , Inc. , 265 F.3d 1294 , 1308 ( Fed.Cir.2001 ) ; De Saracho v. Custom Food Mach. , Inc. , 206 F.3d 874 , 880 ( 9th Cir.2000 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ With respect to the jury instructions , Chiron assigns error to four separate rulings . This court reviews jury instructions in their entirety and `` only orders a new trial when errors in the instructions as a whole clearly misled the jury . '' Delta-X Corp. v. Baker Hughes Prod . Tools , Inc. , 984 F.2d 410 , 415 ( Fed.Cir.1993 ) . Furthermore , Chiron `` must show both fatal flaws in the jury instructions and a request for alternative instructions which could have corrected the flaws . '' Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ First , Chiron argues that the district court erred by instructing the jury on Genentech 's burden of proof without also adding an instruction on the presumption of the ¡¬561 patent 's validity . This court disagrees , because the presumption of validity and heightened burden of proving invalidity `` are static and in reality different expressions of the same thing-a single hurdle to be cleared . '' Am . Hoist & Derrick Co. v. Sowa & Sons , Inc. , 725 F.2d 1350 , 1360 ( Fed.Cir.1984 ) ; see also Moba , B.V. v. Diamond Automation , Inc. , 325 F.3d 1306 , 1319 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) . Moreover , this court has explained : `` [ T ] he presumption is one of law , not fact , and does not *1259 constitute 'evidence ' to be weighed against the challenger 's evidence . '' Avia Group Int ' l Inc. v. L.A. Gear Cal. , Inc. , 853 F.2d 1557 , 1562 ( Fed.Cir.1988 ) . Therefore , the district court did not err in declining to include a jury instruction on the presumption of validity because the jury applied the correct `` clear and convincing evidence '' standard . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Second , Chiron argues that the district court erred by instructing the jury on the law of written description . In particular , Chiron complains that three instructions-the first and third of which were not grouped with the written description instructions-collectively may have directed the jury to find the ¡¬561 patent invalid if the earlier applications did not describe every embodiment known to skilled artisans as of the filing dates . The first instruction set forth the construction of `` monoclonal antibody . '' The second instruction stated : `` An application satisfies the written description requirement if persons of ordinary skill in the art at the time the application was filed would recognize from the application that the inventor actually invented the full scope of the invention as finally claimed in the patent . '' The third instruction set forth that the jury would `` determine whether the forms referred to in the definition of 'monoclonal antibody ' were or were not known in the art at the time the 1984 , 1985 , and 1986 applications were filed . '' This court rejects Chiron 's challenge , because the district court instructed the jury on the proper standard for the written description requirement in the second instruction . Even though the second instruction did not echo the precise language of this court 's cases , this court has stated that `` compliance with ¡± 112 has always required sufficient information in the original disclosure to show that the inventor possessed the invention at the time of the original filing . '' Moba , 325 F.3d at 1320 . The district court 's instruction embodies the principle of this court 's statement in Moba . The district court need not use identical language to this court 's opinions in its instructions . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Separately , Chiron challenges another instruction on written description , which the district court based on Gentry Gallery , Inc. v. Berkline Corp. , 134 F.3d 1473 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) , and Cooper Cameron Corp. v. Kvaerner Oilfield Products , Inc. , 291 F.3d 1317 ( Fed.Cir.2002 ) . In particular , the court instructed the jury : _NEWLINE_ One way Genentech can meet its burden of proving that an earlier application fails to satisfy the written description requirement is to show , by clear and convincing evidence , that the entirety of the specification of an earlier application would clearly indicate to persons of ordinary skill in the art that the invention described in that application is of a much narrower scope than the invention ultimately claimed in the ¡¬561 patent . _NEWLINE_ In considering this issue , the particular question you must decide is whether the 1984 , 1985 or 1986 applications clearly indicate to a person of ordinary skill in the art that the invention described is ... narrower in scope than the claims of the ¡¬561 patent at issue . _NEWLINE_ Chiron argues that this instruction invited the jury to apply a test that does not correspond to this court 's written description law . This court again rejects Chiron 's argument . Once again , though using different words , the district court 's instruction captures the essence of the written description doctrine that a patent can not claim priority to earlier applications if it includes new matter not present in those earlier disclosures . Vas-Cath Inc. v. Mahurkar , 935 F.2d 1555 , 1563-64 ( Fed.Cir.1991 ) . Therefore , this court finds no error in the jury instructions on written description . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1260 Third , Chiron argues that the district court erred by instructing the jury on the law of enablement . In particular , Chiron complains that the district court erred in rejecting the following two proposed instructions : _NEWLINE_ The patent application need only enable what it is claimed . Features or characteristics that are not claimed need not be enabled . In this case , the novel aspect of the invention claimed in the ¡¬561 patent concerns monoclonal antibodies capable of binding to a specific breast cancer antigen . _NEWLINE_ To meet the enablement requirement , an application need not enable every way of making the claimed invention . An application meets the enablement requirement if it enables even one way of making the claimed invention . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This court rejects the notion that the district court erred by declining to include these instructions . The district court provided a succinct and correct summary of the law of enablement that Chiron does not challenge . A trial court need not further instruct the jury on what enablement does not require . Cf . Novo Nordisk A/S v. Becton Dickinson & Co. , 304 F.3d 1216 , 1219-20 ( Fed.Cir.2002 ) ( affirming a district court 's refusal to include an instruction that `` obvious to try '' is not a correct obviousness standard ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Lastly , Chiron argues that the district court erred by instructing the jury that the validity of the dependent claims stands or falls with the validity of the independent claims . Chiron correctly cites the general rule that `` a party challenging the validity of a claim , absent a pretrial agreement or stipulation , must submit evidence supporting a conclusion of invalidity of each claim the challenger seeks to destroy . '' Shelcore , Inc. v. Durham Indus. , Inc. , 745 F.2d 621 , 625 ( Fed.Cir.1984 ) ( emphasis in original ) . The district court clearly recognized and understood that general rule . The district court , however , also recognized that , in this case , the validity challenges to the independent claims coincided with the validity challenges to the dependent claims ; the sameness of the inquiries permitted the treatment of all claims at once . Cf . Nat ' l Recovery Techs. , Inc. v. Magnetic Separation Sys. , Inc. , 166 F.3d 1190 , 1198 ( Fed.Cir.1999 ) ( holding that , under the facts of that case , the dependent claims were invalid solely because their independent claim was invalid ) . Moreover , the district court 's instruction eliminated the potential for an inconsistent verdict ; this court commends such foresight . This court , therefore , holds that the district court did not err in instructing the jury , particularly when those instructions are examined as a whole and read in context . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ With respect to the prejudicial evidence , Chiron assigns error to three rulings . This court will reverse the district court 's denial of a new trial motion based on evidentiary rulings only if Chiron establishes both that the rulings were an abuse of discretion and that it suffered substantial prejudice . Ruvalcaba v. Los Angeles , 64 F.3d 1323 , 1328 ( 9th Cir.1995 ) ; Advanced Cardiovascular , 265 F.3d at 1308 ; United States v. 99.66 Acres of Land , 970 F.2d 651 , 658 ( 9th Cir.1992 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ First , Chiron argues that the district court erred in admitting evidence regarding the accused drug product Herceptin and regarding the absence of a commercial embodiment by Chiron . This court rejects Chiron 's argument , because these facts related to Genentech 's defenses . For example , post-1986 evidence , including evidence regarding Herceptin , may show what was known about making and using humanized antibodies in 1986 . The absence of a commercial embodiment by Chiron also bears on whether chimeric or humanized antibodies within the scope *1261 of the claims of the ¡¬561 patent were routine technology . Accordingly , that evidence is relevant to enablement . Moreover , the district court issued a limiting instruction on the evidence relating to Herceptin , which stated that the jury may consider it helpful in deciding whether the 1986 application meets the enablement and written description requirements . Chiron also takes issue with Genentech 's mention of this evidence in its closing argument . See Union Carbide Chems . & Plastics Tech . Corp. v. Shell Oil Co. , 308 F.3d 1167 , 1183-84 ( Fed.Cir.2002 ) . But Chiron points to no evidence of jury prejudice as a result of the identified statements , which were buried in a seventy-seven page transcript of Genentech 's closing argument . See Hemmings v. Tidyman 's Inc. , 285 F.3d 1174 , 1194 ( 9th Cir.2002 ) ( explaining that an isolated comment during sixty-six page closing argument did not warrant a new trial ) . Accordingly , this court declines to assign reversible error in denying a new trial based on this evidence . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Second , Chiron argues that the district court erred in admitting evidence relating to unclaimed features , such as binding to particular epitopes or specific therapeutic effects . Chiron particularly objects to evidence regarding the extent of the HAMA response caused by murine antibodies . This court rejects Chiron 's argument , because the district court recognized that testimony regarding the HAMA response and epitope binding was relevant to the claimed features of the monoclonal antibodies . Unless the claim construction is incorrect ( which Chiron does not assert ) , this testimony is relevant . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Finally , Chiron argues that the district court erred in excluding previously admitted documents from the prosecution of a related application assigned to Genentech ( the Drebin/Greene application ) . This court rejects Chiron 's argument . Chiron first proffered this evidence , which related to the ¡¬561 patent 's priority date , before declaration of an interference between the ¡¬561 patent and the Drebin/Greene application . When the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences issued a Notice of Interference , the district court decided that it would strike prior evidence introduced by Chiron and informed Chiron that it would be `` inclined '' to grant a mistrial . But when the court directly asked Chiron whether it was making a motion for a mistrial , Chiron expressly declined to do so . Accordingly , the district court did not err in declining Chiron 's post-trial motion for a new trial based on Chiron 's introduction of evidence that was later stricken . Thus , none of these alleged errors warrants reversing the district court 's denial of a new trial . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ IV . _NEWLINE_ Because substantial evidence supported the jury 's verdict that the ¡¬ 561 patent can not claim priority to any of the 1984 , 1985 , and 1986 applications and because the district court did not err in denying Chiron 's motion for a new trial , this court affirms the judgment of the district court . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ COSTS _NEWLINE_ Each party shall bear its own costs . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ AFFIRMED . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ BRYSON , Circuit Judge , concurring . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I concur in the judgment and in most of the court 's opinion . With respect to the issue of priority , I agree that because of a failure to satisfy the written description requirement , Chiron is not entitled to priority back to 1984 for claims broadly construed to incorporate chimeric antibodies . I disagree with the court , however , in holding that the district court erred when it sustained the jury 's verdict that the 1984 application did not enable the chimeric antibodies *1262 claimed in the ¡¬561 patent . I would uphold the jury 's verdict in that regard . In my view , the jury permissibly concluded that the 1984 application , like the 1985 and 1986 applications , did not enable chimeric antibodies . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Citing In re Hogan , 559 F.2d 595 ( CCPA 1977 ) , the court holds that because it would be impossible for an applicant `` to disclose knowledge invented or developed after the filing date '' of the application , and because `` the creation of chimeric antibodies first occurred after the 1984 application , '' the timing of the application and the development of chimeric antibody technology `` precluded any enablement analysis at all . '' To be sure , the enablement issue as to the 1984 application does not affect the outcome of this case , because the court properly finds that the 1984 application failed to satisfy the written description requirement and the patentee therefore was not entitled to priority as of the date of the 1984 application . Nonetheless , I do not agree that the enablement requirement is inapplicable to the 1984 application . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Section 112 , paragraph 1 , of the Patent Act requires that an applicant who wishes to claim property rights in an invention must bear the burden of demonstrating enablement by showing the public how to make and use the invention . As applied to this case , that principle would require the 1984 application to enable the invention claimed in that application . In my view , In re Hogan does not prevent us from reaching that conclusion . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In Hogan , the PTO rejected certain claims for lack of enablement after concluding that , in light of post-application developments , the claim scope was broad enough to read on certain embodiments that were not enabled by the application . The Court of Customs and Patent Appeals reversed , holding that it was enough that the application enabled the claims as construed in light of the state of the art at the time of filing . As the court explained , `` if appellants ' 1953 application provided sufficient enablement , considering all available evidence ( whenever that evidence became available ) of the 1953 state of the art , i.e. , of the condition of knowledge about all art-related facts existing in 1953 , then the fact of that enablement was established for all time and a later change in the state of the art can not change it . '' 559 F.2d at 605 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I have no quarrel with the holding of Hogan-that enablement must be judged in light of the state of the art at the time of the application . What must be guarded against , in my view , is to interpret Hogan to hold that claims that are enabled by the original application may be construed broadly enough to encompass technology that is not developed until later and was not enabled by the original application . Although there is language in Hogan that could be read to support such a result , this court has recently ( and properly , in my view ) expressed reservations about reading Hogan that broadly . See Plant Genetic Sys. , N.V. v. DeKalb Genetics Corp. , 315 F.3d 1335 , 1340-41 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In Plant Genetic Systems , the court explained that Hogan `` simply held that one could not use a later-existing state of the art to invalidate a patent that was enabled for what it claimed at the time of filing . '' 315 F.3d at 1340 . This makes perfect sense because , as the Hogan court explained , `` The use of a subsequently-existing improvement to show lack of enablement in an earlier-filed application on the basic invention would preclude issuance of a patent to the inventor of the thing improved , and in the case of issued patents , would invalidate all claims ... therein . '' 559 F.2d at 606 . The court in Hogan did not take the additional step of holding that the claims in that case should be construed to encompass the later-arising technology . *1263 In fact , Hogan explicitly declined to construe the claims at issue in that case , although the court suggested in dictum that the scope of the claims might be broad enough to encompass the later-arising technology that was at issue . Id . The court in Plant Genetic Systems noted that the technology that was developed after the application was filed ( and thus was not enabled by the application ) fell within the scope of the claims if the claims were broadly construed , but added that `` the claims ( albeit with a narrower scope ) might be nevertheless enabled in view of the state of the art then existing . '' 315 F.3d at 1341 ( emphasis added ) . Plant Genetic Systems further cautioned against using `` the dicta from Hogan '' to `` expand the coverage of claims , yet create a new , lower standard of enablement . '' Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I think the proper approach , suggested in the concurring opinion in Hogan and in Plant Genetic Systems , is to address cases of new technology by construing claims , where possible , as they would have been understood by one of skill in the art at the time of the invention , and not construing them to reach the as-yet-undeveloped technology that the applicant did not enable . That approach preserves the benefits of patent protection for the invention that the applicant has actually conceived and enabled , without extending those benefits for an invention that the applicant may not have conceived and certainly has not enabled . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In this case , however , the patentee is not seeking to preserve the validity of its claims by construing them in accordance with the state of the technology at the time of the invention . Instead , Chiron is arguing that the 1984 application provides support for claims covering technology that was not in existence at that time . In that setting , where the claims are accorded a scope that exceeds the scope of the enablement , I would hold that the claims are not entitled to priority as of 1984 , not only because of a failure to satisfy the written description requirement , but also because the 1984 application does not enable the asserted claims . I would therefore uphold the jury 's verdict of lack of enablement not only as to the 1985 and 1986 applications , but as to the 1984 application as well . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 363 F.3d 1247 , 70 U.S.P.Q.2d 1321 _NEWLINE_ Footnotes _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Chiron also relies upon independent claims 1 and 9 . _NEWLINE_ Claim 1 recites : _NEWLINE_ A monoclonal antibody that binds to a human breast cancer antigen that is also bound by monoclonal antibody 454C11 which is produced by the hybridoma deposited with the American Type Culture Collection having Accession No .

This court , however , need not decide that issue . In any event , the 1984 application did not exercise the lexicographer 's option of expressly defining the disputed term . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_

( collectively `` Cox '' ) . See Verizon Servs . Corp. v. Cox Fibernet Va. , Inc. , No . 08-CV-0157 ( E.D.Va . Oct. 6 , 2008 ) ( judgment ) ; Verizon Servs . v. Cox Fibernet Va. , Inc. , 08-CV-0157 ( E.D.Va . Nov. 7 , 2008 ) ( order denying cross-motions for judgment as a matter of law and new trial ) ; Verizon Servs . Corp. v. Cox Fibernet Va. , Inc. , No . 08-CV-0157 ( E.D.Va . Nov. 11 , 2008 ) ( agreed order amending and clarifying the judgment ) . On appeal , both parties challenge the district court 's denial of their respective motions for judgment as a matter of law and motions for new trial . Because the evidence introduced at trial supports the jury 's verdict , and because the district court did not err in instructing the jury on the scope of the claims , we affirm . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I . BACKGROUND _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A . The Patents at Issue _NEWLINE_ The six patents at issue in this appeal are owned by Verizon and relate generally to packet-switched telephony-technology for providing telephone calls by breaking up voice signals and sending the resulting data in packets , not all of which need traverse the same path , through a network . Packet-switched telephony increases the efficiency of the underlying network over traditional circuit switching , which relies on a dedicated path between endpoints of a call . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ To explain the technology involved in the six asserted patents , the parties divide them into three groups : the ¡¬711 and ¡¬574 patents ( the `` Feature Patents '' ) , the ¡¬275 , ¡¬869 , and ¡¬481 patents ( the `` Network Patents '' ) , and the ¡¬597 patent ( the `` Quality of Service Patent '' ) . None of the claims in any of the patents at issue in this appeal refer explicitly to the Internet or to a `` public packet data network , '' which this court has previously equated to the Internet . Verizon Servs . Corp. v. Vonage Holdings Corp. , 503 F.3d 1295 , 1305 ( Fed.Cir.2007 ) . Instead , the asserted claims refer to `` packet switched networks , '' `` circuit switched networks , '' and a `` system of interlinked packet data networks . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 . The Feature Patents ( '711 and ¡¬574 ) _NEWLINE_ The Feature Patents share a specification and involve methods for providing features such as call-forwarding over packet-switched networks . These features are made possible by an enhanced name translation server . The specification describes the existing Domain Name System ( `` DNS '' ) , which uses computers associated with the Internet , known as domain name servers , to convert textual domain names into numeric Internet Protocol ( `` IP '' ) addresses . The specification also describes software developed for use on personal computers to permit the two-way transfer of real-time voice information via an Internet data link between two personal computers ( `` VOIP '' ) . The inventions relate to a server with an expanded variety of translation *1330 services over a traditional domain name server , allowing for a wider range of routing options over packet-switched networks . This additional functionality allows providers of VOIP to offer enhanced features , such as call-forwarding and voicemail , to which users of traditional telephone service have become accustomed . Although the inventions are `` particularly advantageous for processing of voice telephone communications through the packet data network , '' they are not limited to voice services or the Internet . ¡¬711 patent col.6 ll.48-50 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 2 . The Network Patents ( '275 , ¡¬869 , and ¡¬481 ) _NEWLINE_ The Network Patents relate to an architecture for providing per-call support functionality for voice service over a packet-switched network . The inventions in this group provide for bundling the traditionally separate databases of usage recording , pricing , and authorization into a single logical database in order to ensure scalability of the system , reduce the potential for fraud , and allow mechanisms for network support infrastructure , pricing , call flow , and billing . The patents do not require this single logical database , referred to as a `` unitary logical object '' or `` ULO , '' to be implemented as a single physical system . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 3 . The Quality of Service Patent ( '597 ) _NEWLINE_ The Quality of Service Patent covers a method for providing services over a packet-switched network by dynamically allocating resources to vary the quality of service on a call-by-call basis . The invention includes an enhanced routing technique , which is more flexible than the traditional routing tables used by the public switched telephone network and allows the invention to quickly respond to changes in network configuration and network traffic . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B . The Parties and the Litigation _NEWLINE_ In 1996 , Cox began to offer telephone service . This service initially was based on traditional , circuit-switched telephony , operated over Cox 's private cable network . In 2003 , Cox began to provide telephone service over its private cable network using a packet-switched technology called PacketCable . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In January 2008 , Verizon sued Cox for willfully infringing its patents by deploying Cox 's packet-switched telephone service . Four of the six patents at issue , the Feature Patents ( the ¡¬711 and ¡¬574 patents ) and two of the three Network Patents ( the ¡¬275 and ¡¬869 patents ) , had been previously litigated in Verizon Servs . Corp. v. Vonage Holdings Corp. , No . 06-CV-1782 ( E.D.Va.2007 ) ( `` Vonage `` ) . Although different claims were asserted in Vonage , the claims at issue in that case were closely related to the asserted claims in this case and used many of the same terms . The issues relating to the Feature Patents were reviewed by this court on appeal , and the claim constructions made in connection therewith were affirmed . Verizon Servs . Corp. v. Vonage Holdings Corp. , 503 F.3d 1295 ( Fed.Cir.2007 ) . The district court adopted the relevant claim constructions from the Vonage litigation and , in addition , construed several terms that had not been at issue in the Vonage case . Verizon Servs . v. Cox Fibernet Va. , Inc. , No . 08-CV-0157 , 2008 WL 5169451 ( E.D.Va . Sept. 3 , 2008 ) ( `` Claim Construction Order `` ) . A jury found that Cox did not infringe any of the asserted claims of the six patents and that the asserted claims of the Feature Patents were invalid . Verizon Servs . v. Cox Fibernet Va. , Inc. , No . 08-CV-0157 ( E.D.Va . Oct. 6 , 2008 ) ( jury verdict ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ After the jury verdict , Verizon renewed its Rule 50 ( a ) motion for judgment as a matter of law ( `` JMOL '' ) under *1331 Rule 50 ( b ) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and , alternatively , moved for a new trial under Rule 59 ( a ) . Cox filed its own motions for JMOL under Rules 50 ( a ) and ( b ) arguing that the asserted claims of the Network Patents and the Quality of Service Patent are invalid . In the alternative , Cox requested a new trial on invalidity in the event the district court were to grant Verizon a new trial on infringement . The district court denied all of these motions and both parties appeal . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We discuss the parties ' arguments in the following order . First , we discuss Verizon 's argument that a new trial is necessary for both validity and infringement of all the asserted claims in all six patents because Cox improperly made arguments to the jury about claim scope . Second , we discuss the challenges to the jury 's verdicts on validity of the asserted claims of the Feature Patents . This includes Verizon 's request for JMOL that the Feature Patents are not invalid and , in the alternative , its request for a new trial on validity of the Feature Patents because of an allegedly improper argument by Cox . This section also includes Cox 's cross-appeal of the denial of its motion for JMOL that the Network Patents and the Quality of Service Patent are invalid and its alternative motion for new trial . Third , we discuss the challenges to the jury 's verdicts finding no infringement , including Verizon 's request for JMOL of infringement of claim 1 of the ¡¬481 patent and its request for a new trial on infringement of the asserted claims of the Quality of Service Patent based on its allegation that the district court misconstrued a claim term . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C . ¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( 2006 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ DISCUSSION _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I .

Wilkerson , 84 F.3d 692 , 696 ( 4th Cir.1996 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ II . Jury Arguments About Claim Scope _NEWLINE_ Verizon argues that we should vacate the district court 's judgment that the *1332 asserted claims of the Feature Patents are invalid and that Cox did not infringe any of the asserted claims of all six patents because Cox improperly made arguments to the jury about claim scope that subverted the jury 's ability to fairly decide the issues before it . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The scope of the claims was considered at several times leading up to trial . At the claim construction phase of the proceedings , both parties agreed that the term `` packet data network '' in the asserted claims included both public networks , like the Internet , and private networks , like that used by Cox . The construction adopted by the district court was that the term `` packet data network '' means : _NEWLINE_ a packet-switched data network , where the network transports packets of data over a non-dedicated circuit to a destination , and each packet includes source and destination addresses . _NEWLINE_ Claim Construction Order 4-5 . Neither party asserts on appeal that this construction is incorrect . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Prior to the jury charging conference , Verizon submitted a proposed jury instruction stating `` [ t ] he subjective intent of the inventor when he used a particular term is of little or no probative weight in determining the scope of a claim . It is not unusual for there to be a significant difference between what an inventor thinks his patented invention is and what the ultimate scope of the claims is after allowance by the Patent and Trademark Office . '' Verizon Servs . v. Cox Fibernet Va. , Inc. , No . 08-CV-0157 , 2008 WL 7512298 ( E.D.Va . Sept. 24 , 2008 ) ( Verizon 's proposed jury instruction No . 31 ) . The district court did not give this proposed instruction and rejected Verizon 's renewed request made prior to the initiation of jury deliberations . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ At the trial , the district court gave comprehensive instructions to the jury defining its role in claim construction . The instructions included the following : `` the scope of the patent claims is a question of law for me to decide '' ; `` you must give the claims the scope my interpretations give them '' ; `` all of the terms which I have not given you in an express interpretation are to be given by you their ordinary and customary meaning to a person of ordinary skill in the art to which the patent pertains '' ; and `` [ t ] he scope of the patent is not limited to particular embodiments ... but is limited only by what is fairly within the scope of the claims . '' Trial Tr . vol . 8 , 1694 , 1704 , Sept. 29 , 2008 . The district court also instructed the jury that `` [ f ] rom time to time in their arguments , the lawyers may have stated what law was applicable to this case . And if they made a reference ... that is contrary to what I state the law to be , you must disregard what the lawyers said and abide by what the Court states the law to be . '' Trial Tr . vol . 8 , 1717 , Sept. 29 , 2008 . Neither party argues that any of the jury instructions were incorrect . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The dispute in this case is not over the district court 's claim construction or jury instructions , but instead about arguments that Cox made to the jury about claim scope . More specifically , Verizon alleges that Cox and its experts repeatedly argued that the scope of the asserted claims was limited by the intent of the inventors . In support of this allegation , Verizon cites to several places where Cox 's counsel and its experts referred to statements of the inventors and then distinguished Cox 's system from the asserted claims based on those statements . Verizon also points to the following statement made by Cox 's counsel while he questioned an expert , `` [ Verizon ] accuse [ s ] a small part of the *1333 Cox system which has nothing to do with the purpose of the patent . '' Verizon 's Principal Br . 13 . In addition , Verizon asserts that although witness testimony about the Internet 's role in the patents was `` unobjectionable as background , '' during closing arguments Cox improperly made statements inviting the jury to use this testimony to interpret the claims . Verizon 's Reply Br . at 6-7 . The particular portion of Cox 's closing argument that Verizon finds objectionable is the following : _NEWLINE_ You will notice that the Court has construed some terms , but not all the terms . And at the bottom of each page there is a footnote that I want you to look at and read . And what it says is , `` all of the terms that the Court did not give an express interpretation , are to be given their customary and ordinary meaning to a person of ordinary skill in the art to which the patents pertain . '' _NEWLINE_ In other words , all this language that is not construed , you have got to apply as it would be understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art . Well , I certainly am not , and I assume that at least some of you are not persons of ordinary skill in this art . So , how are you to do that ? To apply these patent terms or these claims , you have got to understand what they cover , what the context is . And that 's why we put on the evidence that we have . _NEWLINE_ Trial Tr . vol . 8 , 1650 , Sept. 29 , 2008 . According to Verizon , this `` unmistakably created a dispute over claim scope by inviting the jury to limit the claims to the Internet . '' To remedy this perceived problem , Verizon requested an instruction after the district court charged the jury that `` none of the claims in this case is limited to the Internet . '' Trial Tr . vol . 8 , 1722 , Sept. 29 , 2008 . The district court denied this request . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Verizon frames its challenge on appeal as a claim construction issue governed by O2 Micro International Ltd. v. Beyond Innovation Technology Co. , Ltd. , 521 F.3d 1351 ( Fed.Cir.2007 ) . In O2 Micro , the parties disputed the specific meaning of the claim term `` only if '' at the Markman hearing . Id . at 1357 . In its Markman order , while acknowledging the parties ' dispute , the court ruled that the term had a well-understood definition and therefore needed no construction . Id . At trial , the `` only if '' limitation `` was a key issue disputed by the parties '' and both parties presented explicit arguments to the jury regarding the term 's meaning . Id . at 1358 . In O2 Micro , we held that the district court 's conclusion that the term `` only if '' need not be construed was wrong because it left the parties ' dispute over the scope of the claim term unresolved and was a question of law that should have been determined by the court and not left to the jury . Id . at 1361 . Thus , we remanded the case to the district court for proper construction of the claim term `` only if . '' Id . at 1362-63 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Several subsequent cases have clarified when a remand for additional claim construction is appropriate . For example , in Kinetic Concepts , Inc. v. Blue Sky Medical Group , Inc. , we noted that `` [ w ] hile [ O2 Micro ] permits a remand for further claim construction , it does not require one , '' particularly when the parties do not use the allegedly disputed construction in front of the jury . 554 F.3d 1010 , 1019 n. 4 ( Fed.Cir.2009 ) . Further , in Broadcom Corp. v. Qualcomm Inc. , we refused to remand a case for further construction of a claim term when the purported dispute over claim construction was raised for the first *1334 time after the jury verdict . 543 F.3d 683 , 694 ( Fed.Cir.2008 ) ( `` Unlike in O2 Micro , where the parties disputed the proper construction of a term at a pre-trial Markman hearing , 521 F.3d at 1362 , Qualcomm here has failed to offer its proposed construction of 'networks ' at or prior to trial , and we reject such arguments raised for the first time after the jury verdict . '' ) _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Verizon characterizes Cox 's closing argument as creating `` an actual dispute regarding whether the patent claims were limited to communications over the Internet and/or the particular problems the inventors were trying to solve '' and requires reversal under O2 Micro . Verizon 's Principal Br . 23 . Verizon 's reliance on O2 Micro is misplaced . Unlike O2 Micro , where the scope of a specific claim term was in dispute beginning at the Markman hearing and continuing throughout the trial , Verizon never identified at any time during the proceedings before the district court any specific claim term that was misconstrued or that needed further construction . Moreover , the allegedly improper arguments it complains that Cox made do not relate to any particular misconstrued term . Cox did not invite the jury to choose between alternative meanings of technical terms or words of art or to decide the meaning of a particular claim term , as was the case in O2 Micro . To the contrary , Cox asserts that not only did it not argue that the claim generally should be limited to the Internet , it acknowledged through its expert that the asserted claims are not limited to the Internet . Specifically , Cox 's expert , Dr. Evans , testified at the trial that : _NEWLINE_ Q . In your conclusion that the Cox system does not have a system of interlinked packet data networks but instead is one network , are you relying in any way on a distinction between the public or private interlink packet data networks ? _NEWLINE_ A . No , sir , I 'm not . _NEWLINE_ Trial Tr . vol . 4 , 839 , Sept. 23 , 2008 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Cox contends that the arguments now objected to by Verizon were not intended to limit claim scope but more broadly to distinguish its accused system , which it contended lacked any sort of `` system of interlinked packet data networks , '' from the claimed system of the Feature Patents . Cox also argues that because it believed at the time it implemented its PacketCable system that Verizon 's patents solved problems related to the Internet , it was proper to contend at the trial-as a matter unrelated to claim scope-that its actions should not be found to have been willful . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ While Verizon attempts to characterize the issue as one of claim construction , its argument is more accurately about whether Cox 's arguments to the jury about the distinction between how its system works and the Internet were improper in offering the jury `` appealingly simplifying ways to determine invalidity and infringement '' thus `` invit [ ing ] the jury to shirk its key factfinding function . '' Verizon 's Principal Br . 28-29 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On that issue , we turn , once again , to the law of the Fourth Circuit . See Juicy Whip , Inc. v. Orange Bang , Inc. , 382 F.3d 1367 , 1370-71 ( Fed.Cir.2004 ) . The Fourth Circuit reviews the refusal to set aside a verdict based on improper arguments by considering the totality of the circumstances , including `` the nature of the comments , their frequency , their possible relevancy to the real issues before the jury , the manner in which the parties and the court treated the comments , the strength of the case ( e.g. , whether it is a *1335 close case ) , and the verdict itself . '' Arnold v. E. Air Lines , Inc. , 681 F.2d 186 , 197 ( 4th Cir.1982 ) ( quoting City of Cleveland v. Peter Kiewit Sons ' Co. , 624 F.2d 749 ( 6th Cir.1980 ) ) . Only when there is a `` reasonable probability , '' that improper arguments effectively subverted `` the jury 's reason or [ ] its commitment to decide the issues on the evidence received and the law as given it by the trial court '' can an abuse of discretion in declining to set aside that verdict be found . Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On this record , we are not persuaded that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to order a new trial on the basis of Cox 's arguments to the jury . Validity and infringement were vigorously litigated , with extensive testimony , physical exhibits , and argument from both sides . Each side presented multiple expert witnesses . From thousands of pages of trial testimony , Verizon singles out snippets of testimony by Cox 's witnesses and of argument by counsel as improper . And Verizon admits that each of the cited statements `` were not necessarily objectionable on their own , '' but that somehow taken together , these statements made `` prejudice to the jury deliberations inescapable . '' Verizon 's Principal Br . 28 ; Verizon 's Reply Br . 6-7 . We disagree . We can not say that the singular or cumulative effect of these statements effectively subverted the jury 's reason or commitment to decide the issues on the evidence received and the law as given by the court . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court specifically instructed the jury that counsel 's arguments and statements were not evidence . During closing , along with the allegedly improper arguments , Cox properly described the specific claim limitations that were missing from the accused system . In addition , Verizon did not , during the trial , request a limiting instruction based on Cox 's allegedly improper claim scope arguments . Nor did Verizon object to any arguments made during Cox 's closing . Finally , Verizon had the opportunity , in its own closing , to rebut any improper or misleading statements it perceived in Cox 's closing arguments but instead said nothing . Looking at the entire record , including the extensive evidence and testimony along with the district court 's comprehensive jury instructions , we see no reason to conclude that the district court abused its discretion in finding that the jury had not been deprived of its ability to decide this case . We thus conclude that the district court properly denied Verizon 's request for a new trial . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ III . Validity _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A. JMOL _NEWLINE_ Both parties argue that the jury verdicts on validity should be overturned because the jury could not reasonably have made its decision based on the evidence advanced at trial . Verizon argues that Cox presented insufficient evidence to support the jury 's finding that the asserted claims of the Feature Patents were invalid . Cox , on the other hand , argues that the Network Patents and the Quality of Service Patent are invalid as a matter of law . At trial , Cox argued that all the asserted claims of Verizon 's six patents were invalid because of anticipation and obviousness . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 . Anticipation _NEWLINE_ To show invalidity of the asserted claims of the Feature Patents , Cox presented an expert at trial , Dr. Mark J. Handley . Dr. Handley testified that two papers he had co-authored on protocols for using the Internet for telephony , a February 1996 *1336 draft of the Session Initiation Protocol ( `` SIP Article '' ) and a November 1995 paper on Session Description Protocol ( `` SDP Article '' ) , along with another document entitled RFC 1183 , were relevant prior art . Dr. Handley testified that the Feature Patents were anticipated , as the SIP Article disclosed all the elements of the claims in the ¡¬711 patent and RFC 1183 disclosed all elements of the ¡¬574 patent . For example , after extensive explanation of how the SIP Article disclosed each element of asserted claims 1 , 3 , and 11 of the ¡¬711 patent , Dr. Handley testified : _NEWLINE_ Q. Dr. Handley , I believe we were getting ready to get to a dependent Claim 3 of the ¡¬711 patent . Did you reach an opinion as to whether that claim is embodied in your 1996 SIP article ? _NEWLINE_ A . Yes , I believe it is . _NEWLINE_ ... _NEWLINE_ Q . Do you have anything else to add to your conclusion that Claims 1 and 11 are invalid in view of the SIP article ? _NEWLINE_ A . No , I believe that that 's the key points , that all of these elements are present in the February 1996 document . _NEWLINE_ Trial Tr . vol . 4 , 909 , 914 , Sept. 23 , 2008 . Dr. Handley also provided testimony that RFC 1183 disclosed each element of the asserted claims of the ¡¬ 574 patent-independent claim 5 and dependent claim 6 , which adds to claim 5 the limitation `` wherein the reply also contains an address conforming to the first protocol '' : _NEWLINE_ Q . Okay . So , let 's look at your slides here . If you could look at Exhibit 25 , Defendant 's Exhibit 4225 [ `` Claim 5 of the ¡¬574 Patent v.1990 RFC 1183 '' J.A . 15721 ] . Does that help illustrate your point that Claim 5 of the ¡¬574 patent is embodied in this 1990 RFC ? _NEWLINE_ A . Yes . This is basically what you have already seen several times . _NEWLINE_ ... _NEWLINE_ Q . What about , we do n't have a slide for this , but what about Claim 6 's point about adding another IP address . Was that disclosed in the RFC ? _NEWLINE_ A . It is disclosed in the RFC sort of implicitly . _NEWLINE_ Trial Tr . vol . 4 , 927 , 930 , Sept. 23 , 2008 . In addition , Dr. Handley testified that the SIP Article and SDP Article , read together , anticipated the asserted claims of both of the Feature Patents . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Cox also called Dr. Williams and Dr. Helgert as expert witnesses to testify that the asserted claims of the Network Patents and the Quality of Service Patent were anticipated . Dr. Williams testified that U.S. Patent 5,233,604 ( `` the ¡¬604 patent '' ) disclosed every element of the asserted claims of the Quality of Service Patent . Dr. Helgert testified that U.S. Patent 6,310,873 ( `` the ¡¬873 patent '' ) disclosed each element of the asserted claims of the Network Patents . Verizon , in turn , presented an expert witness at trial , Pieter Zatko , who testified that the ¡¬604 patent did not disclose several limitations of the asserted claims of the Quality of Service Patent and therefore did not anticipate those claims . Verizon also called an expert , Dr. Houh , who testified that the ¡¬873 patent did not disclose several elements of the asserted claims of the Network Patents . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ For a prior art reference to anticipate a patent , it must disclose each and *1337 every limitation of the claimed invention . Schering Corp. v. Geneva Pharms. , Inc. , 339 F.3d 1373 , 1377 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) . `` [ A ] prior art reference may anticipate without disclosing a feature of the claimed invention if that missing characteristic is necessarily present , or inherent , in the single anticipating reference . '' Id . However , a patent claim `` can not be anticipated by a prior art reference if the allegedly anticipatory disclosures cited as prior art are not enabled . '' Amgen , Inc. v. Hoechst Marion Roussel , Inc. , 314 F.3d 1313 , 1354 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) . `` The standard for what constitutes proper enablement of a prior art reference for purposes of anticipation under section 102 , however , differs from the enablement standard under section 112 . '' Rasmusson v. SmithKline Beecham Corp. , 413 F.3d 1318 , 1325 ( Fed.Cir.2005 ) . It is well-settled that utility or efficacy need not be demonstrated for a reference to serve as anticipatory prior art under section 102 . See Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Ben Venue Labs. , Inc. , 246 F.3d 1368 ( Fed.Cir.2001 ) ; In re Schoenwald , 964 F.2d 1122 , 1124 ( Fed.Cir.1992 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Verizon argues that since the SIP paper refers to the SDP paper only as a `` companion draft , '' it does not properly identify the specific material it incorporates as required to treat two documents as one for anticipation purposes . Kyocera Wireless Corp. v. Int ' l Trade Comm ' n , 545 F.3d 1340 , 1352 ( Fed.Cir.2008 ) . Verizon also argues that since incorporation by reference is a matter of law , it was improperly left for the jury to decide without any instruction . Verizon is correct that if incorporation by reference comes into play in an anticipation determination , it is the court 's role to determine what material in addition to the host document constitutes the single reference . Advanced Display Sys. , Inc. v. Kent State Univ. , 212 F.3d 1272 , 1283 ( Fed.Cir.2000 ) . However , we find that Dr. Handley 's testimony , noted above , provided substantial evidence for the jury to determine that the SIP paper , by itself , anticipated the claims of the ¡¬711 patent , and the RFC 1183 paper anticipated the claims of the ¡¬574 patent . Therefore , the lack of instruction on incorporation by reference was harmless . See z4 Techs. , Inc. v. Microsoft Corp. , 507 F.3d 1340 , 1354 ( Fed.Cir.2007 ) ( holding that district court 's erroneous jury instruction was harmless because the instruction would not have affected the outcome of the case ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Verizon also argues that the SIP and SDP articles are not enabling because they do not disclose or enable the `` basic claim requirement '' of being able to make ordinary two-way telephone calls . However , none of the claims in the Feature Patents actually recite performing two-way telephone calls . The patents relate to telephony , but do not specifically recite the steps of making an actual call . Furthermore , Cox 's expert , Dr. Handley , provided testimony that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have had no problems implementing the functionality disclosed in the SIP Article . The record thus reveals that the jury had substantial evidence to find that the SIP Article was enabling in the sense of 35 U.S.C . ¡± 102 and that the Feature Patents were invalid based on anticipation . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 2 . Obviousness _NEWLINE_ Dr. Handley testified that , in addition to being anticipated , the asserted claims of the Feature Patents would have been obvious to one of skill in the art based on both the SIP Article and the SDP Article . `` In reviewing the jury verdict of obviousness , we review whether the *1338 jury was correctly instructed on the law , and whether there was substantial evidence whereby a reasonable jury could have reached its verdict upon application of the correct law to the facts , recognizing that invalidity must be proved by clear and convincing evidence . '' U.S. Surgical Corp. v. Ethicon , Inc. , 103 F.3d 1554 , 1563 ( Fed.Cir.1997 ) ( internal citations omitted ) . A determination of obviousness in this case requires an inquiry into the scope and content of the prior art , the level of ordinary skill in the art , and the differences between the claimed inventions and the prior art . Graham v. John Deere Co. , 383 U.S. 1 , 17 , 86 S.Ct . 684 , 15 L.Ed.2d 545 ( 1966 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Verizon argues that the jury could not have found that the Feature Patents would have been obvious because `` Cox offered no evidence of what an ordinary skilled artisan in the relevant art would be taught by the prior art or find obvious in light of the proper art . '' Verizon 's Principal Br . 42 . Verizon asserts that Cox 's expert , Dr. Handley , testified regarding obviousness using the wrong field of art- '' Internet and network protocols '' -instead of the art correctly defined by the district court in the jury instructions `` telephony and wireless communications . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ While it is true that the Feature Patents pertain to telephony and wireless communications , the language of the patents themselves , which make frequent reference to the Internet , makes clear that the patents also relate to the field of Internet and network protocols . In fact , Dr. Handley explained that he was describing the background of a person of ordinary skill working in the area of the `` Internet telephony industry , '' which is clearly a subset of telephone and wireless communications . `` In determining the relevant art for purposes of addressing issues of patent validity , the court must look to the nature of the problem confronting the inventor . '' Bancorp Servs. , L.L.C . v. Hartford Life Ins . Co. , 359 F.3d 1367 , 1375 ( Fed.Cir.2004 ) . The problem facing the inventors of the Network Patents was related to providing communication services , including voice telephone service , over packet-based networks , including the Internet . Therefore , the relevant art in this case plainly includes the use of network protocols and the Internet . Thus , it was not improper for the jury to rely on Dr. Handley 's testimony to find that the Feature Patents were obvious . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ * * * _NEWLINE_ Both parties assert numerous additional arguments about the reliability of the other party 's experts and the sufficiency of the other party 's evidence relating to invalidity . We do not find these arguments persuasive . The jury was presented with opposing experts expressing conflicting views about the validity of the six patents-in-suit . The jury was entitled to resolve the conflicting evidence in favor of Cox for the Feature patents and for Verizon on the Network and Quality of Service patents . Bio-Tech . Gen. Corp. v. Genentech , Inc. , 267 F.3d 1325 , 1330-31 ( Fed.Cir.2001 ) ; see also U.S. Surgical , 103 F.3d at 1559 ( affirming a jury verdict of invalidity because `` [ c ] onflicting evidence and argument must be viewed as resolved favorably to the party in whose favor the jury found . The reviewing court must give appropriate deference to the jury 's choices in weighing the evidence , in deciding between opposing positions , and in drawing factual inferences. '' ) . Looking at the record as a whole , we find that the jury had substantial *1339 evidence upon which to conclude that Cox met its burden of showing invalidity by clear and convincing evidence for the Feature patents , but that it did not meet its burden of showing invalidity of the Network and Quality of Service patents . Therefore , we find the district court correctly determined that a reasonable jury could find that the Feature Patents were invalid for anticipation or obviousness and that the Network Patents and Quality of Service Patent were not . We affirm the district court 's denial of Verizon 's motion for JMOL on validity and Cox 's motion for JMOL on invalidity . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B . New Trial _NEWLINE_ Verizon argues that a new trial is required on validity of the Feature Patents because the district court failed to correct another improper argument by Cox relating solely to validity . Verizon alleges that Cox improperly argued that the jury could find the Feature Patents invalid simply because they were identical , in all material respects , to what was taught in the prior art SIP and SDP articles . Verizon points to testimony by Dr. Handley explaining the evolution of the 1996 SIP and SDP articles to the current SIP protocol used by the accused system as improper . In addition , Verizon again points to statements in Cox 's closing argument : _NEWLINE_ Now , what is the mistake they made ? They made a mistake of accusing that protocol [ SIP ] of infringing their patent . So , what they are doing is they are saying , by using this protocol , you infringe . But the protocol predates the patent . _NEWLINE_ So , they have accused the prior art . That invalidates their patent . _NEWLINE_ Trial Tr . vol . 8 , 1673 , Sept. 29 , 2008 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ It is true that in Zenith Electronics Corp. v. PDI Communication Systems , Inc. , 522 F.3d 1348 , 1363 ( Fed.Cir.2008 ) , this court held that `` anticipation can not be proved by merely establishing that one 'practices the prior art . ' `` Instead , `` [ a ] nticipation requires a showing that each element of the claim at issue , properly construed , is found in a single prior art reference . 'It is the presence of the prior art and its relationship to the claim language that matters for invalidity . ' `` Id . ( quoting Tate Access Floors , Inc. v. Interface Architectural Res. , Inc. , 279 F.3d 1357 ( Fed.Cir.2002 ) ) . In Zenith , we remanded a finding of anticipation because the accused infringer provided no evidence whatsoever that the accused product satisfied two limitations of the asserted claim . Id . This is not the case here . As described above , Cox 's expert , Dr. Handley , detailed how the prior art disclosed each of the claim elements . Thus , a reasonable jury could conclude , based on evidence in the record and separate and apart from any alleged `` practicing the prior art '' argument , that the Feature Patents were invalid . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On cross-appeal Cox asserts that it is entitled to a new trial on validity of the Network and Quality of Service patents because the district court abused its discretion in excluding the factual testimony of Eric Voit and Kelvin Porter , named inventors of Verizon 's patents . Cox argues that the district court erred in adopting Verizon 's argument that assignor estoppel precluded inventor testimony about prior art . We need not and do not address the issue of assignor estoppel because the district court properly allowed testimony from the witnesses about the patents they invented based on their personal knowledge , and properly excluded these same witnesses from providing expert testimony on invalidity for which they had not previously *1340 provided expert reports or been qualified as an expert . The district court did not abuse its discretion in limiting inventor testimony to factual testimony that did not require expert opinion . See Kumho Tire , Ltd. v. Carmichael , 526 U.S. 137 , 152 , 119 S.Ct . 1167 , 143 L.Ed.2d 238 ( 1999 ) ( `` [ W ] e conclude that the trial judge must have considerable leeway in deciding in a particular case how to go about determining whether particular expert testimony is reliable . `` ) ; Voice Techs . Group , Inc. v. VMC Sys. , Inc. , 164 F.3d 605 , 615-16 ( Fed.Cir.1999 ) ( stating that the inventor may provide testimony explaining the claimed invention and its development , but that `` the inventor can not by later testimony change the invention and the claims from their meaning at the time the patent was drafted and granted '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ IV . Infringement _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A. JMOL _NEWLINE_ Verizon asserts that it is entitled to JMOL of infringement of claim 1 of the ¡¬481 Network Patent because it `` demonstrated that Cox 's system practices every step of that claim and Cox never disputed Verizon 's expert testimony regarding how calls were actually made on Cox 's system . '' Verizon 's Principal Br . 33-34 . A determination of infringement is a question of fact , reviewed for substantial evidence when tried to a jury . Lucent Techs. , Inc. v. Gateway , Inc. , 580 F.3d 1301 , 1309 ( Fed.Cir.2009 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Claim 1 of the ¡¬481 patent recites : _NEWLINE_ 1 . A method of establishing a communication path between terminals through a packet switched network , a circuit switched network , and at least one interface that interconnects the packet switched network and the circuit switched network , comprising the steps of : _NEWLINE_ a ) requesting from one of said terminals the establishment of said communication path through said interface ; _NEWLINE_ b ) searching a first database for the address of a second database containing a table of terminal data which includes identification of said requesting terminal ; _NEWLINE_ c ) searching said second database to obtain data regarding said requesting terminal ; _NEWLINE_ d ) responsive to data regarding said requesting terminal obtained from said search authorizing the establishment of said communication path ; and _NEWLINE_ e ) responsive to said authorization establishing said communication path between terminals through said interface . _NEWLINE_ ¡¬481 patent col.34 l.52-col.35 l.3 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Both parties provided expert testimony on infringement . Cox provided expert testimony that its accused system does not practice several of claim 1 's limitations . First , Cox 's expert , Dr. Evans explained that Cox 's system does not practice the requirement of `` searching a first database '' because it simply uses the domain name server to translate the textual domain name of a known Call Management Server ( `` CMS '' ) into its numeric IP Address and this translation is a lookup , not a search . Trial Tr . vol . 4 , 783 , Sept. 23 , 2008 . Verizon countered with expert testimony that this translation amounts to `` searching '' as required by claim 1 . Trial Tr . vol . 1 , 197-99 , Sept. 17 , 2008 . Therefore , there was a factual dispute between the experts over whether a simple database lookup for translation is equivalent to `` searching a first database . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1341 Second , Dr. Evans testified that a CMS is not a database and therefore does not qualify as the `` second database '' in the limitation `` searching a first database for the address of a second database . '' Trial Tr . vol . 4 , 783 , Sept. 23 , 2008 . In addition , another Cox witness explained that any database residing internally on a CMS was not addressable by IP address and therefore could not be returned by the domain name server lookup . Trial Tr . vol . 3 , 609-10 , Sept. 22 , 2008 . Verizon 's expert , Dr. Houh , testified that the CMS is equivalent to `` the second database '' because the CMS is a server that includes a database containing a table of terminal data . Trial Tr . vol . 1 , 197-99 , Sept. 17 , 2008 . Again , this amounted to a factual dispute between the experts over whether Cox 's system was fairly within the scope of the claims . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Both of these factual disputes were properly for the jury to decide . The jury was entitled to credit Cox 's experts over Verizon 's experts and thus it was not unreasonable for the jury to find that claim 1 of the ¡¬481 patent was not infringed . See Kinetic Concepts , Inc. v. Blue Sky Med . Group , Inc. , 554 F.3d 1010 , 1024 ( Fed.Cir.2009 ) ( finding that a jury is at liberty to accept or reject expert testimony ) ; accord Aldridge v. Balt . & Ohio R.R . Co. , 789 F.2d 1061 , 1065 ( 4th Cir.1986 ) , aff 'd en banc , 814 F.2d 157 ( 4th Cir.1987 ) . There is no basis on which to overturn the district court 's denial of Verizon 's request for JMOL on this ground . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Verizon also argues that Cox improperly argued that steps ( a ) and ( b ) in claim 1 had to be performed in sequence . Verizon points to the following testimony from Cox 's expert , Dr. Evans : _NEWLINE_ Q . You say [ step ] ( b ) occurs before ( a ) you mean in Verizon 's contentions ? _NEWLINE_ A . Yes . In the patent , ( a ) comes before ( b ) , but in time , if you look at what happens on the way Cox 's system works , ( b ) would have to occur before ( a ) . _NEWLINE_ Trial Tr . vol . 4 , 781 , Sept. 23 , 2008 . The district court found that Dr. Evans 's testimony on sequence was simply an explanation , not a part of his opinion as to why there was no infringement . Trial Tr . vol . 4 , 837-38 , Sept. 23 , 2008 . In fact , Verizon itself later clarified this with Dr. Evans : _NEWLINE_ Q . Just to clarify the last point , Dr. Evans , you were not claiming , I understand , that the various steps of the patent , and in particular , step ( b ) , has to be done in a particular order in order for the patent claim to be satisfied ; is that correct ? _NEWLINE_ A . That would be a legal conclusion , so that is correct . _NEWLINE_ The district court subsequently instructed the jury `` [ t ] here is no requirement that steps ( a ) , ( b ) or ( c ) occur in any order . '' Trial Tr . vol . 8 , 1702-03 , Sept. 29 , 2008 . Because the jury had substantial evidence to find that claim 1 of the ¡¬481 patent was not infringed based on the district court 's undisputed construction of that claim , we find the district court did not err in denying Verizon 's motion for JMOL on this issue . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B . New Trial _NEWLINE_ Verizon contends that a new trial on infringement of the ¡¬597 Quality of Service Patent is required because the district court misconstrued the term `` evaluating said set of candidate resources to find a best candidate resource . '' Verizon asserted that Cox infringed claims 12 , 13 , and 20 of the Quality of Service Patent . Independent claim 12 represents the asserted claims : _NEWLINE_ 12 . A method of providing services in a communications network , which comprises the steps of : _NEWLINE_ *1342 receiving a request for service ; _NEWLINE_ determining criteria for a resource necessary to provide the requested service ; _NEWLINE_ searching a resource data structure for a set of candidate resources meeting said criteria wherein each resource of said resource data structure comprises a resource identifier , a set of static attributes , and a set of dynamic attributes ; _NEWLINE_ evaluating said set of candidate resources to find a best candidate resource ; and _NEWLINE_ allocating said best candidate resource to meet said request for service . _NEWLINE_ ¡¬597 patent col.9 ll.1-15 ( emphasis added ) . Claims 13 and 20 are dependent from claim 12 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We need not resolve this issue because the jury had substantial evidence to find that the ¡¬597 patent was not infringed regardless of whether the district court was correct in its construction of `` evaluating said set of candidate resources to find a best candidate resource . '' We may affirm the jury 's findings on infringement `` if substantial evidence appears in the record supporting the jury 's verdict and if correction of the errors in a jury instruction on claim construction would not have changed the result , given the evidence presented . '' Teleflex Inc. v. Ficosa N. Am . Corp. , 299 F.3d 1313 , 1328 ( Fed.Cir.2002 ) . The record shows that Cox 's expert testified that many of the limitations of the ¡¬597 patent were not performed by Cox 's system , including the `` determining a criteria , '' `` searching a resource data structure , '' and `` evaluating said set of candidate resources '' limitations . For example , one of Cox 's experts testified as follows : _NEWLINE_ Q . [ C ] an you just summarize what you found was missing in terms of how Cox 's , how Cox operates ? _NEWLINE_ A . Well , in the Cox system , the very first element , which is a network based selection of a service , is not present . Cox does not do its network path selection on a network basis . _NEWLINE_ Element ( b ) , there is no determination of a criteria . All of Cox 's systems have the same criteria for a voice call . So , there is no differentiation between the types of calls . _NEWLINE_ Element ( c ) , there is no resource data structure within the Cox system . There is no resource data structure that contains the type of information we are talking about here . _NEWLINE_ Q . Then what about the last step , this evaluation step in finding the best candidate resource ? _NEWLINE_ A . So , the evaluation step , there is no evaluation of candidate resources because there are no candidate resources created . And also there is no allocation of a best resource because all of the resources that are being accused by Verizon are equivalent resources . _NEWLINE_ Trial Tr . vol . 5 , 1115 , Sept. 24 , 2008 . Because the evidence that Cox 's system does not practice several of these limitations does not depend on the disputed claim construction , the jury had substantial evidence to find that the ¡¬597 patent was not infringed independently of the disputed limitation . Moreover , because we hold that Verizon is not entitled to a new trial on infringement , we need not and do not reach Cox 's arguments that a remand on infringement would entitle it to a new trial on validity based on an allegedly erroneous construction of the claim term `` authenticating ... from a unitary logical object . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ CONCLUSION _NEWLINE_ For the foregoing reasons , we affirm the district court 's denial of Verizon 's motion *1343 for a new trial on all issues based on Cox 's allegedly improper arguments regarding claim scope . We also affirm the district court 's denial of both parties ' motions for JMOL of validity or invalidity and Verizon 's alternative request for a new trial on validity of the Feature Patents .

( `` Lucas '' ) . Ekchian v. Home Depot , Inc. , No . 95-1273-A ( E.D.Va . Dec. 8 , 1995 ) ( as corrected by Order entered on Dec. 11 , 1995 ) . Because the district court misconstrued the asserted claims and because , under a proper claim construction , genuine issues of material fact remain in dispute , we vacate and remand . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ BACKGROUND _NEWLINE_ Ekchian is the owner and a named co-inventor of U.S. Patent 4,624,140 . The '140 patent concerns variable capacitance displacement sensors which can be used as inclinometers ( such as in a carpenter 's level ) to measure degree of inclination or tilt . Variable capacitance inclinometers use an internal capacitor having a capacitance that is proportional to the degree of inclination . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A capacitor is formed by sandwiching a dielectric between two conductive surfaces or `` plates . '' Capacitors store electric charge on the `` overlapping '' portions of the two conductive plates , creating an electric field across the dielectric material . An ideal capacitor has completely conductive plates and a non-conductive dielectric material so that charges flow easily through the plates , but do not cross the dielectric , thereby accumulating at the boundaries formed by the plates and the dielectric . Because real-world materials rarely approach the ideal , capacitors generally have less than perfectly conductive plates and contain dielectric materials that conduct some charge . Generally , for a capacitor to function properly , the conductivity of the capacitor plates must be substantially greater than the conductivity of the dielectric . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The capacitance of a capacitor generally depends upon three factors . Capacitance is proportional to the area of overlap of the conductive plates and to the magnitude of the `` dielectric constant '' of the dielectric material ( a fixed value for a given material ) , and it is inversely proportional to the thickness of the dielectric . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Prior art variable capacitance inclinometers generally used two solid plates with a liquid dielectric partially filling the space between the plates . The remainder of the space was filled by a gas that typically had a substantially lower dielectric constant than the liquid . Thus , the average dielectric constant was a function of both the liquid and the gas . These inclinometers were constructed so that as they were tilted , the amount of liquid filling the space between the plates changed . As the ratio of liquid to gas changed , the average dielectric constant of the space changed , thereby affecting the measured capacitance across the plates . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The '140 invention differs from these prior art inclinometers by replacing the liquid with a solid dielectric and replacing one of the *1301 fixed capacitor plates with a conductive liquid . The patent specification discloses a vessel , partially filled with a conductive liquid , that has a solid conducting interior wall with a thin dielectric coating . A capacitor is formed by the overlap of the liquid and the vessel wall ( or fixed plate ) , which are separated from each other by the thin dielectric coating , as illustrated below . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ? _NEWLINE_ -- -- - _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As the vessel is tilted , the amount of liquid in contact with the dielectric coating changes . Instead of varying the average dielectric constant , the claimed device varies the amount of overlap between the vessel wall and the liquid in proportion to the degree of inclination . Because the thickness of the dielectric coating can be considerably less than the thickness of a liquid dielectric , the claimed device improves on the prior art by producing a substantially greater capacitance compared with the prior art devices . _NEWLINE_ Claim 1 , with emphasis added , is representative of the asserted claims and reads as follows : _NEWLINE_ 1 . A capacitive displacement sensor , comprising _NEWLINE_ a vessel having a wall including at least two adjacent conductive wall segments , _NEWLINE_ means for electrically insulating said wall segments from each other , _NEWLINE_ a dielectric coating on the interior of at least one but not all of said wall segments , the interior of at least one conductive wall segment being exposed , _NEWLINE_ a conductive liquid-like medium contained inside said vessel covering a variable part of at least one wall segment with said dielectric coating and at least one wall segment without said dielectric coating , and _NEWLINE_ electronic means electrically connected to at least one wall segment with said coating and at least one wall segment without said coating for producing an output related to the capacitance between said liquid-like medium and said one wall segment with said dielectric coating , _NEWLINE_ whereby displacement of said vessel causes relative movement between said vessel and said liquid-like medium and a concomitant detectable change in the capacitance between said liquid-like medium and the wall segment with the dielectric coating . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Ekchian filed suit against Lucas alleging that the Lucas `` Accustar '' inclinometers infringe every claim of the '140 patent . The accused device uses a vessel partially filled with liquid and has a thin film coating on an interior wall . Lucas denied infringement , claiming that the liquid in the accused device acts as a dielectric across which an electric field is generated and that , in any event , its liquid is not sufficiently conductive to be covered by the claims of the patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On Lucas 's motion for summary judgment , the district court construed the claim term `` conductive liquid-like medium '' as requiring a conductivity similar to the examples contained in the specification , which exceed the conductivity level of the liquid in the accused device . The court held that in light of its claim construction and based upon prosecution history estoppel , the accused device did not infringe the patent , literally or under the doctrine of equivalents . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1302 DISCUSSION _NEWLINE_ We review a district court 's grant of summary judgment de novo .

Conceptronic , Inc. , 90 F.3d 1576 , 1582-83 , 39 USPQ2d 1573 , 1576-77 ( Fed.Cir.1996 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Application of a properly construed claim to an accused device is a question of fact . On appeal from a grant of summary judgment of noninfringement , we must determine whether , on the patentee 's version of the facts , the district court correctly concluded that the patentee had failed to show that a reasonable jury could find infringement . See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby , Inc. , 477 U.S. 242 , 248 , 106 S.Ct . 2505 , 2510 , 91 L.Ed.2d 202 ( 1986 ) ; Conroy , 14 F.3d at 1575 , 29 USPQ2d at 1377 ( `` The moving party ... may discharge its burden by showing the district court that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party 's case. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In construing the claims of the '140 patent , the district court declined to adopt Ekchian 's proposed definition of `` conductive '' as `` the slightest ability to carry a current '' because it concluded that such an interpretation would render the limitation meaningless , essentially reading the term `` conductive '' right out of the claims . Because Ekchian 's proposal would `` include virtually all liquids ( and , indeed , all materials ) on the planet , '' the district court sought a narrower definition that would render the term meaningful . The court concluded that , as a matter of law , the claimed conductive liquid-like medium did not extend to the liquid in the accused device . In particular , it determined that the liquid in the accused device `` is vastly less conductive '' than the preferred liquid mentioned in the patent specification and that the two liquids appear to be used for different purposes , the invention employing a liquid as a capacitor plate and the accused device employing a liquid as a dielectric . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Ekchian argues that the district court erred in its claim construction by reading the conductivity of the preferred embodiment into the claims . Ekchian contends that the patent does not impart any special meaning to the term `` conductive '' and therefore that the term 's ordinary meaning to those skilled in the art should control . Lucas , on the other hand , contends that the district court properly interpreted the claim in light of the specification and that the patent defines `` conductive liquid-like medium '' as being limited to liquids having a conductivity equal to or greater than the examples listed in the specification . To support its proposition , Lucas relies on the following sentence in the specification which states , `` Accordingly , the label 'conductive liquid-like medium ' used herein shall refer to materials of whatever kind whether liquid or not , meeting the foregoing requirements of flowability , conformity , horizontal surface retention and conductivity . '' '140 patent , col. 5 , line 66-col. 6 , line 2 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Lucas argues that the examples of conductive liquids in the specification are the only *1303 `` foregoing requirements of ... conductivity '' disclosed in the patent and therefore must be read as limiting the claim term . We do not agree . Contrary to the assertion by Lucas , the expression `` the foregoing requirements '' also refers to the enumerated requirements immediately preceding the quotation , which include , `` [ i ] n addition , all points beneath the horizontal upper surface of the liquid medium must be conductive , preferably but not necessarily uniformly conductive. `` '140 patent , col. 5 , lines 60-63 . The statement thus is not a reference only to the stated examples , as Lucas asserts . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ More importantly , Lucas identifies nothing further to support its contention that the term `` conductive '' is limited to the conductivity levels inherent in the disclosed examples . While examples disclosed in the preferred embodiment may aid in the proper interpretation of a claim term , the scope of a claim is not necessarily limited by such examples . See Laitram Corp. v. Cambridge Wire Cloth Co. , 863 F.2d 855 , 865 , 9 USPQ2d 1289 , 1299 ( Fed.Cir.1988 ) ( `` References to a preferred embodiment , such as those often present in a specification , are not claim limitations . `` ) ; Texas Instruments , Inc. v. United States Int ' l Trade Comm ' n , 805 F.2d 1558 , 1563 , 231 USPQ 833 , 835 ( Fed.Cir.1986 ) ( `` This court has cautioned against limiting the claimed invention to preferred embodiments or specific examples in the specification. '' ) . We therefore conclude that the term is not so limited . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Because the specification does not use the term `` conductive '' in a special or unique way , its ordinary meaning to one skilled in the art controls . See Quantum Corp. v. Rodime , PLC , 65 F.3d 1577 , 1580 , 36 USPQ2d 1162 , 1165 ( Fed.Cir.1995 ) ( `` [ T ] he words of a claim will be given their ordinary meaning to one of skill in the art unless the inventor appeared to use them differently . `` ) ; cf . Texas Instruments , Inc. v. Cypress Semiconductor Corp. , 90 F.3d 1558 , 1564 , 39 USPQ2d 1492 , 1497 ( Fed.Cir.1996 ) ( `` Although the dictionary broadly defines 'conductor ' as any substance that conducts an electrical charge , the patent itself belies such a broad construction. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Ekchian contends that those skilled in the art would recognize that the term `` conductive liquid-like medium '' in the context of the claimed invention refers to any material that is sufficiently more conductive than the dielectric so that a capacitor is formed . We agree . There is nothing in the patent specification that suggests that Ekchian intended to limit the meaning of that term to a specific range of conductivity . This does not mean that the claim term `` conductive '' is meaningless or superfluous . Both Lucas and Ekchian agree that the term `` conductive '' ordinarily means the ability to transport electric charge . Furthermore , it is undisputed that the specification and prosecution history both state that the liquid must act as a capacitor plate , which must necessarily store electric charge . Therefore , one skilled in the art of capacitor design would recognize that the term `` conductive '' modifies `` liquid-like medium '' in the claims to indicate that the liquid must act as a capacitor plate , i.e. , that it must be sufficiently more conductive than the dielectric material so that it stores electric charge . Accordingly , we hold that the district court erred in its claim construction by incorrectly limiting the degree of conductivity permitted by the term `` conductive liquid-like medium . '' Within the context of this patent , `` conductive liquid-like medium '' means a medium sufficiently conductive to perform its function as a variable capacitor plate . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Ekchian also argues that the district court erred by holding that prosecution history estoppel precludes a finding of infringement . He first contends , and states the issue to be one of first impression , that an Information Disclosure Statement ( `` IDS '' ) can not be the basis for an estoppel because it is not submitted to the Patent Office in order to overcome a rejection by the examiner . We do not agree with this argument . An IDS is part of the prosecution history on which the examiner , the courts , and the public are entitled to rely . Ekchian distinguished his invention from the submitted prior art as a kind of preemptive strike against a potential rejection . He intended his statement to be relied on . It is reasonable to infer , absent an indication to the contrary , that an examiner will consider an IDS when *1304 determining whether to allow the claims ; the courts and the public may rely on it as well . An argument contained in an IDS which purports to distinguish an invention from the prior art thus may affect the scope of the patent ultimately granted . Accordingly , we first hold that statements made in an IDS can be the basis for a court to interpret the scope of the claims of a granted patent . See Standard Oil Co. v. American Cyanamid Co. , 774 F.2d 448 , 452 , 227 USPQ 293 , 296 ( Fed.Cir.1985 ) ( stating that the prosecution history , which includes `` all express representations made by or on behalf of the applicant to the examiner to induce a patent grant , '' limits the interpretation of the claims `` so as to exclude any interpretation that may have been disclaimed or disavowed during prosecution in order to obtain claim allowance. '' ) . Moreover , since , by distinguishing the claimed invention over the prior art , an applicant is indicating what the claims do not cover , he is by implication surrendering such protection . See Southwall Techs . Inc. v. Cardinal IG Co. , 54 F.3d 1570 , 1581 , 34 USPQ2d 1673 , 1681 ( Fed.Cir.1995 ) ( stating that the patentee , having distinguished a prior art reference in arguments made to the PTO , `` can not now escape [ the defendant 's ] reliance upon this unambiguous surrender of subject matter '' ) . To that extent , we also hold that arguments in an IDS can create an estoppel , and thus preclude a finding of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents . See , e.g. , Texas Instruments , Inc. v. United States Int ' l Trade Comm ' n , 988 F.2d 1165 , 1174 , 26 USPQ2d 1018 , 1025 ( Fed.Cir.1993 ) ( discussing impact of statements made in an invention disclosure form placed in PTO file in the context of prosecution history estoppel ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Ekchian next contends that even if the IDS is fair game for use in claim interpretation and for purposes of estoppel , the district court erred by mischaracterizing his arguments regarding the prior art . The court determined that Ekchian differentiated his device from the prior art on the ground that the liquid in his device was conducting while the liquid in the prior art patent was nonconducting . In light of the prosecution history , the court concluded that Ekchian 's claimed liquid-like medium must necessarily be more conductive than the liquid disclosed in the prior art patent . Ekchian asserts that no such distinction was made . He contends that he differentiated his invention on the ground that he uses a solid dielectric with a liquid capacitor plate while the prior art used a liquid dielectric and solid capacitor plate . We agree . The statements in the IDS distinguished the prior art 's use of a liquid dielectric from Ekchian 's invention as follows : _NEWLINE_ [ The prior art ] device differs from the inclinometer of the present invention in which a variable capacitance is established between a rigid wall of a vessel , preferably spherical , and an electrically conductive fluid , liquid , paste , or solid powder mixed in a liquid , which acts as a conductive liquid capacitor plate as the device tilts . The vessel surface has a thin coating of a solid dielectric material of uniform thickness . ( emphasis added ) _NEWLINE_ Thus , Ekchian did not distinguish the conductivity of his liquid from the conductivity of the liquid in the prior art . In fact , the prior art patent does not refer to the conductive properties of its disclosed liquid . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Lucas argues nonetheless that Ekchian , in the IDS , explicitly referred to the prior art liquid as an `` insulator '' and therefore contends that liquids having similar conductivity levels can not be construed to be conductive within the scope of the claims or be considered equivalent to the claimed liquid . We find this argument to be without merit . Ekchian did refer generally to the benefits of using a solid insulator instead of a liquid insulator as a dielectric . However , Ekchian did not characterize the specific liquid used in the prior art device as an insulator , nor did he state whether that liquid could be used as a conductor in a different device . Accordingly , the prosecution history supports the conclusion that the term `` conductive '' is not limited by the conductivity of the liquid disclosed in the prior art . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Finally , given the proper claim construction , we agree with Ekchian that genuine issues of material fact are in dispute . The district court stated that `` the Lucas liquid is employed as a non-conductive dielectric with the express purpose of regulating *1305 and/or impeding the charge flow across its capacitor plates '' and `` [ t ] he Lucas liquid operates in a manner that is virtually identical to that of the [ prior art ] patent . '' Ekchian vigorously contests these characterizations of the accused device , submitting evidence tending to indicate that the Lucas liquid does not act as a dielectric . For example , Ekchian submitted an affidavit in which he averred that ( 1 ) when the Lucas liquid is replaced by a highly conductive fluid , its capacitance remains the same and ( 2 ) when the Lucas liquid is replaced by a fluid with an extremely low conductivity , its capacitance drops substantially . Both these tests support the conclusion that the electric charges in Lucas 's accused device are stored in the liquid and not on the fixed plate . Ekchian 's tests thus support his position that the liquid in the accused device acts as a capacitor plate and not as a dielectric as the district court and Lucas both assumed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court appeared to rely on Lucas 's assertion that its device operates in the same manner as described in U.S. Patent 4,644,662 , which is assigned to Lucas . Ekchian submitted affidavits that may show that Lucas is incorrect . Because there is a genuine dispute as to whether the accused device uses its liquid as a dielectric or as a capacitor plate , the court erred by not resolving this doubt in favor of Ekchian on Lucas 's motion for summary judgment . See Conroy v. Reebok Int ' l , Ltd. , 14 F.3d 1570 , 1577 , 29 USPQ2d 1373 , 1378 ( Fed.Cir.1994 ) . On remand , it is for the fact-finder to determine whether the liquid in the accused device acts as the capacitor plate , i.e. , stores the electric charge that generates the measured capacitance . If the liquid acts as a capacitor plate , then the liquid is a `` conductive liquid-like medium '' within the meaning of the claims . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ CONCLUSION _NEWLINE_ The patent claims , specification , and prosecution history uniformly indicate that the patentee intended the term `` conductive '' to take on its ordinary and accustomed meaning . Therefore , the claim term `` conductive liquid-like medium '' requires a liquid-like medium that acts as a capacitor plate by storing electric charge . Because the district court erred in construing the term `` conductive , '' we vacate the judgment in favor of Lucas and remand for further proceedings in light of this opinion . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ VACATED AND REMANDED . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 104 F.3d 1299 , 41 U.S.P.Q.2d 1364

We reverse the court 's judgment as a matter of law and remand . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ BACKGROUND _NEWLINE_ Manufacturers of circuit boards , which are used in various electronic devices , use circuit board testers to test circuit boards before the boards are integrated into finished products . Many testers require an interface plate , which is a plastic grid with holes that permit connections between the tester and the circuit board . In order to align circuit boards during testing , it is advantageous to mark certain holes on the interface plate . Prior art methods of marking interface plates included placing Mylar masks on the surface of the interface plate , painting the surface of interface plates , and making shallow drill marks on interface plates . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The patents at issue claim systems and methods related to marking interface plates . Claim 1 of the ¡¬796 patent is representative : _NEWLINE_ 1 . An indicator interface plate configured to provide readily visible identification of predetermined holes , the plate comprising : _NEWLINE_ a surface including a plurality of holes having visually discernable markings to allow a user to visually determine which of said plurality of holes are to be populated , wherein a region of the plate said plurality of holes have a first predetermined indicia covering the surface surrounding said plurality of holes , the plate further comprising : a second removable indicia overlying said first predetermined indicia , said second indicia being different from said first predetermined indicia , wherein said second indicia is removed from areas of said plate adjacent each of said predetermined holes , said predetermined holes are visually identifiable to a user by the appearance of the first indicia . _NEWLINE_ ¡¬796 patent col.6 ll.36-51 ( emphases added ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Circuit Check sued QXQ , Inc. , alleging that QXQ 's interface plates infringed its patents . QXQ stipulated to infringement and the parties stipulated that three references describing interface plate marking techniques were prior art to the patents : the TTCI Specifications ; the Plexus Specification ; and the method depicted in Figure 1 of the ¡¬796 patent and described in its specification ( collectively , the `` stipulated prior art '' ) . J.A.1983-84 . These documents disclosed several marking techniques , such as painting near the hole or drilling near the hole and painting over the drill mark . QXQ concedes in its briefing that the stipulated prior art does not disclose an interface plate comprising `` a second removable indicia overlying said first predetermined indicia ... wherein said second indicia is removed from areas of said plate adjacent each of said predetermined holes . '' ¡¬796 patent col.6 ll.45-50 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ At trial , QXQ argued that three additional references-rock carvings , engraved signage , and a machining technique known as Prussian Blue ( collectively , the `` disputed prior art '' ) -disclose the limitation not present in the stipulated prior art and constitute analogous prior art . Circuit Check argued that the references were not analogous . With respect to rock carvings , in which a varnish is applied to rocks and then scrapped off to make designs , Circuit Check presented testimony that a skilled artisan at the time of the invention would not have considered rock carvings to have been reasonably pertinent to the marking *1334 problem . J.A . 1388 , 1447 . With respect to engraved signage , in which the top layer of a multi-layer product is removed to expose a bottom layer , Circuit Check presented testimony that engraved signage was not relevant to the problem solved by the patents . J.A . 1388 , 1434 . And with respect to Prussian Blue , a machining technique whereby dye is applied to a workpiece and then removed by a scribe or drill , Circuit Check presented testimony that Prussian Blue could not be used to make the claimed invention and had no connection to the problem solved by the patents . J.A . 1387-88 , 1397 , 1430-32 , 1443-44 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The validity of claims 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 11 , 13 , and 14 of the ¡¬ 796 patent ; claims 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 11 , 12 , and 14 of the ¡¬766 patent ; and claims 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 11 , and 12 of the ¡¬566 patent was submitted to the jury . The jury found the asserted claims not invalid for obviousness . J.A . 1995-96 . The jury also found that the infringement was willful and awarded damages . J.A . 1996-97 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ After the jury verdict , QXQ filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law that the asserted claims are invalid as obvious . The district court granted QXQ 's motion , acknowledging that QXQ 's `` obviousness argument is not premised on citing specific examples of prior art in the applicable field , nor does it rely on nuanced discussion about the level of ordinary skill in that particular field . '' J.A . 6 . It found that although there was no doubt that rock carvings `` are not technically pertinent to the 'field ' of circuit testers , '' and `` witnesses credibly testified that Prussian Blue dye had not been used on alignment plates , '' `` any layman '' would have understood that interface plates could be marked using the techniques described in the disputed prior art . J.A . 8 . It further noted that `` any vandal who has 'keyed ' a car knows that stripping the paint with a key will result in the underlying metal color showing through . '' J.A . 5 . It found that none of the objective considerations affected its conclusion that the asserted claims would have been obvious . J.A . 13 . With respect to claims 5 and 11 of the ¡¬796 patent , the court determined that even though QXQ did not present evidence that the additional limitations of the claims would have been obvious , those additional limitations were too trivial to support nonobviousness .

Smith & Nephew , Inc. , 688 F.3d 1342 , 1360 ( Fed.Cir.2012 ) . The underlying factual inquiries include : ( 1 ) the scope and content of the prior art , ( 2 ) the differences between the prior art and the claims at issue , ( 3 ) the level of ordinary skill in the art , and ( 4 ) any relevant objective considerations , such as commercial success , long felt but unsolved needs , and the failure of others . Graham v. John Deere Co. , 383 U.S. 1 , 17-18 , 86 S.Ct . 684 , 15 L.Ed.2d 545 ( 1966 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ By finding the claims nonobvious , the jury presumably found that the disputed prior art is not analogous and therefore not within the scope of the prior art . See Jurgens , 927 F.2d at 1557 . Substantial evidence supports the jury 's presumed finding . To be considered within the prior art for purposes of the obviousness analysis , a reference must be analogous . Wang Labs. , Inc. v. Toshiba Corp. , 993 F.2d 858 , 864 ( Fed.Cir.1993 ) . Whether a reference is analogous art is a question of fact . Wyers v. Master Lock Co. , 616 F.3d 1231 , 1237 ( Fed.Cir.2010 ) . Prior art is analogous if it is from the same field of endeavor or if it is reasonably pertinent to the particular problem the inventor is trying to solve . Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The jury was instructed that `` the field of the invention is circuit board testers and test fixtures used in the manufacture of electronics . '' J.A . 1984 . The disputed prior art-rock carvings , engraved signage , and Prussian Blue-is not part of the field of circuit board testers and test figures . Therefore , the disputed prior art can be analogous only if it is reasonably pertinent to the particular problem solved by the inventor . Wyers , 616 F.3d at 1237 . Although `` familiar items may have obvious uses beyond their primary purposes , '' KSR Int ' l Co. v. Teleflex , Inc. , 550 U.S. 398 , 420 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 , 167 L.Ed.2d 705 ( 2007 ) , a reference is only reasonably pertinent when it `` logically would have commended itself to an inventor 's attention in considering his problem , '' In re Clay , 966 F.2d 656 , 659 ( Fed.Cir.1992 ) . The jury heard testimony that a person of ordinary skill in the art would not have thought about rock carvings , engraved signage , or Prussian Blue in considering how to mark interface plates . J.A . 1387-88 , 1397 , 1430-32 , 1434 , 1443-44 , 1447 . The jury was entitled to weigh this testimony , find that an ordinarily skilled artisan would not find that the disputed prior art `` logically would have commended itself to an inventor 's attention , '' and thus find the disputed prior art not analogous . See In re Clay , 966 F.2d at 659 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Just because keying a car , for example , is within the common knowledge of humankind does not mean that keying a car is analogous art . An alleged infringer should not be able to transform all systems and methods within the common knowledge into analogous prior art simply by stating that anyone would have known of such a system or method . The question is not whether simple concepts such as rock carvings , engraved signage , or Prussian Blue dye are within the knowledge of lay people or even within the knowledge of a person of ordinary skill in the art . Rather , the question is whether an inventor would look to this particular art to solve the particular problem at hand . Here , Circuit Check put forward evidence that *1336 an inventor would not have considered the disputed prior art when trying to improve marking . It is not hard to arrive at that conclusion . Even though an inventor may be aware of rock carvings , it is not surprising that the inventor would not have looked to rock carvings to improve the process of painting small dots on interface plates for expensive circuit board testers . And , even though an inventor may work in an office with engraved signage , the inventor would not necessarily have considered using the techniques disclosed in engraved signage to solve the problem of marking circuit board tester interface plates . Finally , even though an inventor in this case was aware of Prussian Blue , it is not surprising that one of skill in the art would not consider using a machining technique that employed removable dye on interface plates where such dye could fall into and interfere with the underlying electronics of the circuit board testers . Because the jury 's presumed finding that the disputed references are not analogous is supported by substantial evidence , the only references within the scope of the prior art are the stipulated prior art . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Substantial evidence also supports the jury 's presumed finding that the differences between the stipulated prior art and the claims were significant . The nature of the differences between the prior art and the claims is a question of fact . Graham , 383 U.S. at 17-18 , 86 S.Ct . 684 . Indeed , as QXQ acknowledges , the stipulated prior art fails to disclose an interface plate with the claimed `` second removable indicia . '' Appellee 's Br . 29 . A reasonable jury could have concluded that QXQ did not prove by clear and convincing evidence that the differences between the prior art and the claimed invention were insignificant . The stipulated prior art does not disclose what makes the patented claims unique : placing a second removable indicia on top of the interface plate and then selectively removing that layer to identify certain holes on the interface plate . Additionally , Circuit Check presented testimony that the stipulated prior art taught away from the invention . The jury heard testimony that manufacturer specifications contemplated minimizing the amount of paint on interface plates because paint had a tendency to chip off and fall into the tester , which caused serious problems . J.A . 1362 , 1372 . It also heard testimony that the specifications counselled against covering the entire interface plate with paint . J.A . 1372-73 . Thus , substantial evidence supports the jury 's presumed finding that one of skill would not have been motivated to use more paint to cover the entire surface of the interface plate.2 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Substantial evidence supports the jury 's presumed findings that objective considerations existed to support nonobviousness . Whether objective considerations support a conclusion of nonobviousness is a question of fact . Graham , 383 U.S. at 17-18 , 86 S.Ct . 684 . Because the jury rendered a general verdict that the claims were not obvious , we must presume that they found in favor of Circuit Check on all relevant questions supported by substantial evidence . See Jurgens , 927 F.2d at 1557 . Circuit Check presented evidence of copying , long-felt need , commercial success , skepticism , and unexpected results . With respect to copying , the jury heard testimony that QXQ developed its infringing plates after a customer saw Circuit *1337 Check products embodying the invention and asked QXQ to mark its interface plates by painting the surface and then selectively removing the paint . J.A . 1409-10 , 1520-21 . With respect to long-felt need , the jury heard testimony that the industry tried multiple prior art marking methods preceding Circuit Check 's invention . J.A . 1359-62 . With respect to commercial success , the jury heard testimony that once Circuit Check 's customers received products embodying the patents , they refused to return to interface plates using the prior art marking methods . J.A . 1409 . With respect to skepticism , the jury heard testimony that Circuit Check 's customers were worried about using the new interface plates because the claimed method increased the amount of paint on the interface plate and therefore increased the likelihood that paint would flake off and damage the testers . J.A . 1373 , 1405 . And with respect to unexpected results , the jury heard testimony that a skilled artisan would have been surprised that , because paint was likely to fall into the tester , increasing the amount of paint used would produce desirable interface plates . J.A . 1370-71 , 1373 , 1379-80 . Having been presented with this testimony , the jury is entrusted to weigh evidence and credibility in making its findings . The jury 's presumed findings regarding objective considerations are therefore supported by substantial evidence . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Regarding the legal conclusion of obviousness , the jury 's presumed findings regarding the scope and content of the prior art , differences between the claimed invention and the stipulated prior art , and objective considerations of nonobviousness are supported by substantial evidence . Under these circumstances , a reasonable jury could have concluded that the subject matter as a whole would not have been obvious at the time of the invention . The court erred by granting judgment as a matter of law . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Finally , the court erred by invalidating dependent claims 5 and 11 . Although the court acknowledged that QXQ presented no evidence that the additional limitations in those claims were present in the prior art and presented no evidence that the additional limitations were trivial , it concluded that these claims were obvious because Circuit Check , the patentee , did not explain why the additional limitations rendered the claims non-obvious . J.A . 22 . The court erred in shifting the burden of production to disprove invalidity . `` Each claim of a patent ... shall be presumed valid independently of the validity of other claims ; dependent or multiple dependent claims shall be presumed valid even though dependent upon an invalid claim . '' 35 U.S.C . ¡± 282 . Additionally , `` [ t ] he burden of establishing invalidity of a patent or any claim thereof shall rest on the party asserting such invalidity . '' Id . Although `` in many cases a person of ordinary skill will be able to fit the teachings of multiple patents together like pieces of a puzzle , '' there must be evidence presented on the obviousness of the claim as a whole . KSR , 550 U.S. at 420 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 . Even assuming that the claims from which these claims depend are invalid , it was improper for the court to invalidate the claims absent any evidence regarding the additional limitations of these claims . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Whatever doubts we have about these patents , the jury verdict was supported by substantial evidence . We therefore reverse the district court 's grant of judgment as a matter of law and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ REVERSED AND REMANDED _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ COSTS _NEWLINE_ No Costs . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 795 F.3d 1331 , 115 U.S.P.Q.2d 1478 _NEWLINE_ Footnotes _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Because the patents were filed before the effective date of the America Invents Act , the earlier , pre-Act version of ¡± 103 ( a ) applies .

Geo . M. Martin Co. v. Alliance Mach . Sys . Int ' l , LLC , 634 F.Supp.2d 1024 ( 2008 ) ( JMOL Opinion ) . Because the record supports the trial court 's judgment , this court affirms . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I _NEWLINE_ A `` bundle breaker '' is a machine used to separate stacked sheets of corrugated board . The ¡¬566 patent claims an improvement over the traditional bundle breaker by providing `` compliance structures , '' which allow a bundle breaker to simultaneously break multiple stacks of corrugated board ( logs ) of different heights . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The assembly line in corrugated board manufacturing plants typically includes a number of machines that prepare stacks of corrugated board , or bundles . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ First , a rotary die cutter scores a single sheet of corrugated board , creating a series of `` weakened lines '' so that the board can be separated later into individual boxes . Next , a stacker collects multiple sheets and stacks them into a `` log . '' The stacker aligns the sheets ' weakened lines so that each log contains a series of `` weakened planes . '' The bundle breaker then separates a log into individual bundles by `` breaking '' the log along the weakened planes . Finally , a load former puts the bundles onto pallets . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The ¡¬566 patent , filed on August 28 , 2002 , and issued on December 2 , 2003 , shows a bundle breaker separating a log ( 4 ) into separate bundles ( 2 and 3 ) : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1297 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ? _NEWLINE_ A typical bundle breaker , as essentially shown in this Figure 14 , has an upstream conveyor belt ( 10 ) and a downstream conveyor belt ( 13 ) separated by a gap . When the weakened plane ( 9 ) of a log straddles the gap , or `` breaking line , '' the conveyor belts are stopped , and independent clamps ( 16 and 17 ) are lowered to hold the log in position . The downstream portion of the bundle breaker then pivots about an axis ( 103 ) to break off a bundle . Unlike the bundle breaker shown above , a typical bundle breaker might transfer the separated bundle off of the downstream conveyor before advancing the remaining portion of the log to continue the breaking process . _NEWLINE_ Bundle breakers of this sort were well known in the art when the application for the ¡¬566 patent was filed . The ¡¬566 patent specification describes one prior art bundle breaker , the Pallmac machine , as one that would feed two or more logs through its bundle breaker side by side in order to speed production . As described in the ¡¬566 patent , however , this multiple-log approach came with problems . Specifically , if one or more of the side-by-side logs were higher than the others , due perhaps to a miscount in the number of sheets , the rigid clamps used to hold the logs in position while breaking would exert a different amount of pressure on each log . The ¡¬566 patent describes the result of unequal pressure : _NEWLINE_ [ M ] ore pressure is exerted on the taller logs which can damage compressible material like corrugated cardboard . If the logs are not compressible , then insufficient pressure is placed on the shorter logs and shifting of the logs can occur when the bundles are broken off from the log ... . In the industry , this problem is called a 'lack of compliance ' problem ; i.e. , the force on all the side by side logs is not substantially equal . _NEWLINE_ ¡¬566 patent , col.2 ll.16-31 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The inventors of the ¡¬566 patent , Merrill Martin and Daniel Talken , came up with an improved clamp structure to solve the lack of compliance problem , which they called a `` compliance structure . '' An example of the inventors ' compliance structure is shown most clearly in Figure 20 of the patent : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1298 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ? _NEWLINE_ The compliance structure ( 20 ) includes a fluid-pressurized structure ( 21 ) that is connected to a plurality of rigid members ( 46-55 ) -which the parties call `` platens '' -through a flexible member ( 22 ) . _NEWLINE_ The ¡¬566 patent describes two identical compliance structures on both the upstream and downstream clamps . When each clamp is lowered during operation , the platens will contact the taller log ( 4 ' ) first . The fluid-pressurized structure will then deform the flexible member and allow the clamp to continue to lower until the platens contact the shorter log ( 4 ) . The fluid pressurized structure allows every platen that touches a log to exert an equal amount of pressure on that log , regardless of its height . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Claim 1 of the ¡¬566 patent , the only independent claim , appears in Jepson form . In other words , the preamble describes prior art bundle breakers and then claims the compliance structure mounted on each upper clamp as an improvement . See The Manual of Patent Examining Procedure ( `` MPEP '' ) ¡± 2129 ? III ( 8th ed. , rev.8 , July 2010 ) ( explaining Jepson claims ) . Claim 1 recites ( emphasis added ) : _NEWLINE_ An improvement in a bundle breaker for separating bundles from a log having a generally planar top surface , said log including a plurality of sheets each having a generally planar top surface and each sheet is formed with at least one weakened line , said weakened lines are vertically aligned in said log forming a weakened plane in said log , said bundle breaker including a first conveyor for conveying said log and having an upstream end for receiving said log and a downstream end , and a second conveyor having an upstream end positioned immediately adjacent to said downstream end of said first conveyor providing a gap therebetween defining a bundle breaking plane , said bundle breaker including first clamp means mounted for vertical reciprocating movement above said first conveyor , and second clamp means mounted above said second conveyor for vertical reciprocating movement in relation to said second conveyor and said second conveyor and said second clamp means mounted for conjoint pivotal movement in relation to said bundle breaking plane for progressively breaking a bundle from said log along said weakened plane in said log , said improvement comprising : _NEWLINE_ a. a first compliance structure mounted on said first clamp means including , _NEWLINE_ ( 1 ) a first fluid pressurized structure having a first flexible member presenting a first engagement area for operative engagement with an upstream portion of said generally planar top surface of said log and on the upstream side of said weakened plane in said log ; and _NEWLINE_ b. a second compliance structure mounted on said second clamp means including , _NEWLINE_ ( 1 ) a second fluid pressurized structure having a second flexible member presenting a second engagement area for operative engagement with a downstream portion *1299 of said generally planar top surface of said log and on the downstream side of said weakened plane in said log . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The dependent claims add various limitations that are in accordance with the description provided above . For example , Claim 2 requires that each conveyor have `` a width sufficient to simultaneously transfer and support a plurality of logs in side by side relation . '' Claim 3 further requires that the fluid pressurized structures engage the plurality of logs where `` at least one log [ has ] a height greater than at least one other log . '' Claim 4 requires the flexible members to extend `` substantially the width of said logs '' in the proximity of the weakened plane . Claim 7 requires each flexible member to have a plurality of `` closely spaced rigid members ... for engaging said logs . '' Claim 13 claims an indexing capability , which means that the downstream conveyor can `` receive and hold at least two bundles broken successively '' before discharging them from the conveyor . And claim 14 adds the same indexing improvement to a bundle breaker capable of breaking two or more logs simultaneously , meaning that the downstream conveyor is able `` to receive and hold at least two or more rows of bundles broken successively from a plurality of logs in side by side relation . '' Col.18 ll.33-38 ( emphasis added ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ II _NEWLINE_ Plaintiff The Martin Family Trust ( the `` Trust '' ) is the assignee of the ¡¬566 patent . Plaintiff George M. Martin Co. ( `` Martin '' ) sells the Quik-Break Nicked Bundle Separator ( the `` Quik-Break '' ) , which incorporates the invention claimed in the ¡¬566 patent . Martin began offering the Quik-Break for sale in 2002 and has sold approximately 60 bundle breakers . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Martin has been in the stacker business for a great deal longer than the bundle breaking business-since 1960-and has sold nearly 2,900 stackers in North America alone . In all , Martin has about 90 percent of the stacker market . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Defendant Alliance Machine Systems International LLC ( `` Alliance '' ) is Martin 's main competitor in the market for bundle breakers that break multiple bundles having uneven heights . Alliance typically sells between 10-15 bundle breakers per year . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Trust and Martin sued Alliance in February of 2007 , alleging that Alliance 's bundle breaker infringed the ¡¬566 patent . As a part of its defense , Alliance alleged that Martin lacked standing to sue because Martin did not have a sufficient license to the ¡¬566 patent . Although the Trust 's and Martin 's interests are aligned as to liability , Alliance sought to dismiss Martin because Plaintiffs only sought damages based on Martin 's lost profits ( as opposed to damages based on a reasonable royalty for the ¡¬566 patent ) . The district court held a bench trial solely on the issue of standing , ruling afterwards from the bench that Martin had a `` binding exclusive license [ to the ¡¬566 patent ] implied from the course of dealing between the Trust and ... the company '' and that therefore Martin was `` entitled to sue for lost profits in the case . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court then held a two-week trial on invalidity , infringement , and damages . Following four days of deliberation , however , the jury announced that it could not reach a unanimous verdict . In response , each side filed renewed motions for Judgment as a Matter of Law ( JMOL ) on all issues . The district court granted Alliance 's JMOL motion on the issue of invalidity , ruling that , under the Supreme Court 's decision in KSR International Co. v. Teleflex Inc. , 550 U.S. 398 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 , 167 L.Ed.2d 705 ( 2007 ) , `` [ t ] he evidence on primary considerations and on *1300 secondary considerations is so lop-sided in favor of obviousness that ... judgment [ must ] be entered as a matter of law in favor of [ Alliance ] . '' JMOL Opinion , 634 F.Supp.2d at 1040 . The court denied the remaining JMOL motions as moot . Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Trust and Martin filed a timely notice of appeal , arguing to this court , among other things , that the district court erred in its validity ruling . Alliance cross appeals the district court 's determination that Martin has standing to sue for lost profit damages . This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C . ¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ III _NEWLINE_ This court reviews the grant of a JMOL motion without deference , Ericsson , Inc. v. Harris Corp. , 352 F.3d 1369 , 1373 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) , applying the law of the regional circuit , Riverwood Int ' l Corp. v. R.A. Jones & Co. , 324 F.3d 1346 , 1352 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) . `` A jury 's inability to reach a verdict does not necessarily preclude a judgment as a matter of law . '' Headwaters Forest Defense v.

The test in the Ninth Circuit is `` whether the evidence , construed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party , permits only one reasonable conclusion ... . '' White v. Ford Motor Co. , 312 F.3d 998 , 1010 ( 9th Cir.2002 ) ( internal quotation marks omitted ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 ( a ) , a patent is invalid `` if the differences between the [ claimed ] subject matter ... and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains . '' Whether a patent is invalid as obvious is ultimately a determination of law based on underlying determinations of fact . Monarch Knitting Mach . Corp. v. Sulzer Morat GmbH , 139 F.3d 877 , 881 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) . Those underlying determinations of fact relate to `` the scope and content of the prior art , the differences between the prior art and the claimed invention , the level of ordinary skill in the art , and any relevant secondary considerations , such as commercial success , long-felt need , and the failure of others . '' Lucent Techs. , Inc. v. Gateway , Inc. , 580 F.3d 1301 , 1310 ( Fed.Cir.2009 ) ( internal quotation marks omitted ) . Thus , this court will affirm a district court 's judgment on obviousness as a matter of law if `` the content of the prior art , the scope of the patent claim and the level of ordinary skill in the art are not in material dispute , and the obviousness of the claim is apparent in light of these factors . '' KSR , 550 U.S. at 427 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A _NEWLINE_ Alliance asserts three bundle-breaking machines as prior art : the Pallmac machine , the Visy machine , and the Tecasa machine . This opinion will discuss the relevant attributes of each machine in turn . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ - The Pallmac Machine _NEWLINE_ A company called Pallmac began shipping its first bundle breaker in the United States in 1995 . Originally , the Pallmac machine featured springs and closely spaced wooden grippers , or slats , which would allow the machine to clamp simultaneously several logs with different heights . A series of narrow `` conveyor ropes '' positioned below the logs would move the logs through the machine . When the logs reached the breaking line , the conveyor ropes would stop and `` rigid members '' would rise up from in between the conveyor ropes in order to press the logs against the spring-cushioned slats . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Pallmac redesigned its bundle breaker in 1998 by eliminating the springs and *1301 slats , which required constant maintenance , and replacing them with a fixed wooden plate . In order to allow for variation in log height , Pallmac modified the bottom clamp so that the rigid members rested on an elongated air bag , or `` fire hose , '' that extended the entire width of the machine . In the modified Pallmac machine , the rigid members `` float '' along the top of the airbag . This later version of the Pallmac machine was first installed at a customer site in late 1998 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The ¡¬566 patent itself describes Pallmac 's air bag solution , but describes the following problem with the `` lifting '' approach : `` As the lifting members lower the log [ after breaking ] , a shifting of the individual sheets within the log can occur which changes the position of the weakened plane and can result in failure to break the [ next ] bundle cleanly from the log or produce poorly formed bundles . '' Col.2 ll.50-55 . The Trust highlights this lifting approach as the primary difference between the Pallmac machine and the claimed invention . In other words , while the Pallmac machine clamped incoming logs with a compliance structure from the bottom , the claimed invention does so from the top . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ - The Visy Machine _NEWLINE_ Visy Board ( `` Visy '' ) is an Australian corrugated board manufacturer . In July 1995 , Visy and a U.S. company , Thermoguard Equipment Inc. ( `` TEI '' ) , agreed that TEI would provide Visy with a bundle breaker having a compliance structure able `` to accommodate up to a 1/2 [ inch ] height difference between multiple bundles being broken simultaneously . '' As early as October of 1996 , TEI sold a number of bundle breakers to Visy with an `` air bag clamping '' feature . That feature included steel U-shaped grippers attached to the Visy machine 's upper clamping mechanism with air bags located inside the grippers . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Trust does not contest the district court 's description of how the Visy machine was supposed to work . According to the district court , _NEWLINE_ Flexible air tubing connected all of the air bags so as to allow the air pressure to equalize and to apply the same downward force across all grippers . Logs of uneven height would then come onto the conveyor belts , the grippers would lower , and as the grippers engaged the logs , air would be pushed in and out of the air bags in proportion to the pressure on each so as to redistribute and more equalize the pressure . _NEWLINE_ JMOL Opinion , 634 F.Supp.2d at 1029 . Described as such , the Trust stipulated at trial that the Visy Machine contains the `` fluid-pressurized structure '' and `` flexible member '' limitations of independent claim 1 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Notwithstanding the theory behind the Visy machine , however , the Trust argues that it would not have rendered the asserted claims obvious because it did not contain a working compliance structure . The Trust points to testimony from the on-site project engineer at Visy , Mr. Fankhauser , who stated that the Visy machine was never able to consistently break multiple bundles having uneven heights and even that `` the machine was allergic to breaking multiple logs . '' Thus , Mr. Fankhauser testified that Visy ultimately removed the air bag clamping feature because it did not work , i.e. , it did not `` commercially produce products ... at speeds that the factory was built to achieve . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The problems with the Visy machine were caused in part by the spacing of the grippers in the Visy Machine . According to Mr. Fankhauser , `` pressure is just force divided by area , so ... in a straightforward way , ... if you reduce the area [ covered by the grippers ] , you have to increase the pressure to attain a force . '' *1302 Because the grippers in the Visy machine covered a relatively small area on the surface of the logs , Mr. Fankhauser testified that they needed to exert a large pressure in order to create enough force to hold the logs in place during breaking . This pressure tended to `` bruise or damage the product '' that the Visy machine was trying to break . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ - The Tecasa Machine _NEWLINE_ Another competitor in the corrugated board industry independently made a machine called the Tecasa bundle breaker . At trial , the parties stipulated that the Tecasa machine met every limitation of every asserted claim of the ¡¬ 566 patent and that it was first known in the United States as of June 2002 , almost three months before the filing date of the ¡¬566 patent . The Trust attempted to swear behind the Tecasa machine at trial by arguing that it reduced its invention to practice before June 2002 . Specifically , the Trust presented evidence that Messrs. Martin and Talken conceived of their invention in 1999 , reduced it to practice in 2001 , and offered it for sale in early 2002 . The district court assumed that the inventors of the ¡¬566 patent had reduced their claimed improvement to practice in time to eliminate the Tecasa machine as prior art . Nevertheless , the district court relied on the Tecasa machine as `` plainly show [ ing ] 'simultaneous invention ' as an indicia of obviousness . '' JMOL Opinion , 634 F.Supp.2d at 1036 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B _NEWLINE_ The district court correctly concluded as a matter of law that the differences between the prior art and the claimed improvement were minimal . For instance , the record contains a statement by the Trust 's expert , Dr. Albert Karvelis , that there were only a discrete number of possible design options for choosing the location of the compliance structure : the top clamp , the bottom clamp , or both clamps . This record evidence discredits the Trust 's argument that the difference between the bottom-up approach in the Pallmac machine and the top-down approach in the ¡¬566 patent creates a genuine issue of fact . Bottom versus top is exactly the type of `` finite number of identified , predictable solutions '' that justifies a legal conclusion that the result , when expected , is `` the product not of innovation but of ordinary skill and common sense . '' KSR , 550 U.S. at 421 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Trust relies on the testimony of Alliance 's own Director of Research and Development that , `` from an engineering standpoint , '' one can not simply take the Pallmac design and flip it from bottom to top . That testimony , however , is irrelevant to the obviousness analysis . With one exception , discussed below , the claims themselves do not recite engineering details but merely require that the compliance structures be mounted to clamps that are `` above '' the conveyor belts . Indeed , Alliance 's witness did testify that flipping the Pallmac machine was simple `` from [ a ] concept point of view . '' Moreover , to the extent that engineering obstacles did stand in the way to constructing a machine that used a top-down approach , the Visy machine demonstrated that such obstacles could be overcome . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As noted , the Trust attacks the Visy machine as prior art , alleging that the machine did not work for its intended purpose . The district court appropriately rejected that argument . Under an obviousness analysis , a reference need not work to qualify as prior art ; `` it qualifies as prior art , regardless , for whatever is disclosed therein . '' Amgen Inc. v. Hoechst Marion Roussel , Inc. , 314 F.3d 1313 , 1357 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) . `` Even if a reference discloses an inoperative device , it is prior art for all that it teaches . '' Beckman Instruments , *1303 Inc. v. LKB Produkter AB , 892 F.2d 1547 , 1551 ( Fed.Cir.1989 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Trust concedes that the Visy machine teaches the `` fluid pressurized structure '' and `` flexible member '' limitations ; the main dispute on appeal that the court can discern is whether Visy teaches a `` compliance structure . '' The record , however , definitively warrants the trial court 's conclusion that the Visy machine teaches a `` compliance structure . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court 's construction of `` compliance structure , '' which is not at issue on appeal , is `` a structure that deforms to allow a more uniform distribution of force . '' Geo . M. Martin Co. v. Alliance Mach . Sys . Int ' l , LLC , No . 07-00692 , 2007 WL 4105832 , *4 ( Nov. 16 , 2007 ) ( emphasis added ) . Inventor Talken , Martin 's corporate representative at trial , ran tests on a Visy replica machine that showed that the Visy machine provided a distribution of force across logs of differing heights that was about 267 % more uniform than a Visy machine with immovable , flat platens . Thus , the Trust 's own tests clearly and convincingly establish that the Visy machine contains a structure that `` deforms to allow a more uniform distribution of force . '' In sum , the Visy machine discloses a `` compliance structure . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Trust also appears to argue that , because the claims are to an `` improvement in a bundle breaker , '' an accused infringer must show that any prior art must contain an improvement over and above the improvement recited in the body of the claim . As applied to this case , the Trust argues that the prior art must provide `` 'reliable breaking ' of multiple bundles of uneven heights while avoiding the 'lack of compliance ' problems found in the prior art , namely damage to the boards caused by excessive pressure and inconsistent breaking due to inadequate pressure . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This argument fails because it reads too much into the word `` improvement . '' Although `` the fact that the patentee has chosen the Jepson form of the claim evidences the intention to use the preamble to define , in part , the structural elements of his claimed invention , '' Epcon Gas Sys. , Inc. v. Bauer Compressors , Inc. , 279 F.3d 1022 , 1029 ( Fed.Cir.2002 ) ( internal quotation marks omitted ) , the extent of the claimed `` improvement '' is defined only by the body of the claim . After all , the transition of the claim contains the phrase `` said improvement comprising . '' `` Comprising '' is a term of art that indicates that only what follows is essential . Genentech , Inc. v. Chiron Corp. , 112 F.3d 495 , 501 ( Fed.Cir.1997 ) . Thus , if the patentee intended to claim an improvement that included a structure for `` reliable breaking '' measured against some kind of commercial production standard , it should have explicitly done so or argued on appeal for a construction of `` compliance structure '' that contains such a standard . The record shows that the Trust did neither . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ To be clear , prior art must teach a person of ordinary skill to make an apparatus that works for its intended purpose . Beckman Instruments , 892 F.2d at 1551 . If the Visy machine did not do so on its own , Alliance would have needed to establish that a person of ordinary skill would have nonetheless been able to make a working apparatus . In this case , however , the record shows that the Visy machine did work , insofar as it was able to do what the preamble of claim 1 required , namely , `` separate [ ] bundles from a log . '' Even Mr. Fankhauser testified that the Visy machine was able to break bundles without denting the top box of a stack if the bundles were `` sufficiently small . '' The Visy machine simply did not work at `` production speed . '' As discussed , however , the claims do not require a threshold throughput or commercial speed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1304 The one design specification contained in the asserted claims can be found in the dependent claim 7 requirement that the platens be `` closely spaced . '' The district court held that the `` simple solution '' of enlarging the surface area of the platens would have been apparent to one having ordinary skill in the art based on the `` fundamental and basic principle of physics '' that Force = Pressure x Area . JMOL Opinion , 634 F.Supp.2d at 1037 . This court again agrees with the district court . The Trust argues that if the solution were so simple , someone at Visy or Alliance would have suggested it . The record only shows that Visy and Alliance employees tried to troubleshoot or repair the Visy machine , not redesign it . Thus , their failure to suggest a redesign does not create a reasonable dispute . Indeed , Visy 's Mr. Fankhauser testified that the relationship between pressure and area was `` straightforward . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Finally , on appeal the Trust does not take issue with the district court 's invalidity holding on dependent claims 13 and 14 , both of which relate to `` indexing . '' Thus , this court need not address those points . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ C _NEWLINE_ Secondary considerations of non-obviousness must be considered when present . Sud-Chemie , Inc. v. Multisorb Techs. , Inc. , 554 F.3d 1001 , 1008 ( Fed.Cir.2009 ) . As the Supreme Court recently reaffirmed , `` ' [ s ] uch secondary considerations as commercial success , long felt but unsolved needs , failure of others , etc. , might be utilized to give light to the circumstances surrounding the origin of the subject matter sought to be patented . ' `` KSR , 550 U.S. at 406 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 ( quoting Graham v. John Deere Co. of Kansas City , 383 U.S. 1 , 17-18 , 86 S.Ct . 684 , 15 L.Ed.2d 545 ( 1966 ) ) . In some rare instances , the secondary consideration of simultaneous invention might also supply `` indicia of 'obviousness . ' `` Ecolochem , Inc. v. S. Cal . Edison Co. , 227 F.3d 1361 , 1376 ( Fed.Cir.2000 ) ( quoting Graham , 383 U.S. at 17-18 , 86 S.Ct . 684 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Here , the Trust argues that a number of secondary considerations of non-obviousness preclude a conclusion that the asserted claims are obvious as a matter of law . The district court held that the Trust 's secondary considerations could not overcome `` the fact that nearly every single person or entity who encountered the lack of compliance problems in the industry came up with the same general hydraulic design to manage it . '' JMOL Opinion , 634 F.Supp.2d at 1039 . Upon review , this court agrees that the record shows the evidence of secondary considerations in this case do not create a reasonable dispute as to obviousness . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The commercial success of a product is relevant to the non-obviousness of a claim only insofar as the success of the product is due to the claimed invention . Ormco Corp. v. Align Tech. , Inc. , 463 F.3d 1299 , 1312 ( Fed.Cir.2006 ) . Here , Alliance conclusively established that much of George Martin 's commercial success was due to Martin 's pre-existing market share in the stacker market , which , according to Martin 's president , gave it a `` huge advantage '' in selling other products because it allowed Martin to sell a `` single-source system . '' Thus , this factor carries little weight . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Evidence of a long-felt but unsolved need provides another secondary consideration of non-obviousness . Ecolochem , 227 F.3d at 1376-77 . Where the differences between the prior art and the claimed invention are as minimal as they are here , however , it can not be said that any long-felt need was unsolved . Martin presented evidence that its Quik-Break worked better than any prior art system because , for example , it could simultaneously *1305 break three bundles or more . The record shows , however , that this `` need '' had been met by prior art machines such as the Pallmac and the Visy that could break more than one bundle at a time . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Trust 's evidence of failure of others is similarly insufficient . While a jury might have credited the Trust 's evidence that other machines , such as the Visy machine , did not work as well as the Quik-Break , everything indicates that the Quik-Break 's superiority was due to its enhanced throughput over and above the claimed ability to handle a `` plurality of logs . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Industry praise must also be linked to the patented invention . Power-One , Inc. v. Artesyn Techs. , Inc. , 599 F.3d 1343 , 1352 ( Fed.Cir.2010 ) . The only evidence of industry praise on which the Trust reasonably relies-as opposed to self-serving statements by Martin 's president that the patented feature offers `` increased productivity and increased profitability '' -is an internal Alliance email in which an Alliance employee reports a customer 's statement that `` the Martin breaker is the cat 's meow . '' But that same email notes that the customer also chose the Martin Quik-Break because `` [ t ] he interface between the stacker and the breaker will be handled by a single vendor . '' As with the commercial success factor , this reference to Martin 's market share in the stacker market reduces the impact that this evidence could have in establishing industry praise . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Finally , the Trust points to evidence that Alliance copied the claimed invention , namely , Alliance 's internal `` Bundle Breaker Action Plan '' wherein Alliance analyzed the `` Geo Martin concept , '' notes that the design is patented , and then proposes adding its own `` floating platens capability '' to its bundle breaker . This court has noted , however , `` that a showing of copying is only equivocal evidence of non-obviousness in the absence of more compelling objective indicia of other secondary considerations . '' Ecolochem , 227 F.3d at 1380 . The Trust 's evidence is hardly compelling here , where the same internal memorandum suggested that Alliance 's proposed design was the `` same [ as the ] Pallmac platen concept '' but `` flipped . '' Thus , this evidence does not provide much help to the Trust . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Independently made , simultaneous inventions , made `` within a comparatively short space of time , '' are persuasive evidence that the claimed apparatus `` was the product only of ordinary mechanical or engineering skill . '' Concrete Appliances Co. v. Gomery , 269 U.S. 177 , 184 , 46 S.Ct . 42 , 70 L.Ed . 222 ( 1925 ) . But see Lindemann Maschinenfabrik GMBH v. Am . Hoist & Derrick Co. , 730 F.2d 1452 , 1460 ( Fed.Cir.1984 ) ( `` Because the statute , 35 U.S.C . ¡± 135 , ( establishing and governing interference practice ) recognizes the possibility of near simultaneous invention by two or more equally talented inventors working independently , that occurrence may or may not be an indication of obviousness when considered in light of all the circumstances. '' ) . The Trust takes issue with the district court 's reliance on the invention of the Tecasa machine as a simultaneous invention . According to the Trust , Martin and Talken reduced their claimed invention to practice as early as 2001 , whereas the parties stipulated that the Tecasa machine was first known in the United States in June 2002 . The Trust argues that this timing can not constitute `` contemporaneous '' invention as a matter of law . The Trust 's argument would have more force if the Tecasa machine provided the only evidence of simultaneous invention . The existence of the Pallmac and Visy machines , however , shows that the Tecasa machine was invented within a `` comparatively short space of time . '' As *1306 discussed , the evidence reveals that the relevant Pallmac machine was first installed in 1998 , and the Visy machine was first sold in 1996 , approximately three and five years , respectively , before the Trust alleges its invention was reduced to practice . The district court was therefore correct to conclude that the invention of the Tecasa machine , occurring only a year later than the earliest possible reduction-to-practice date of the claimed invention , qualified as a simultaneous invention . As such , `` 'though not determinative of statutory obviousness , [ it is ] strong evidence of what constitutes the level of ordinary skill in the art . ' `` Ecolochem , 227 F.3d at 1379 ( quoting The Int ' l Glass Co. v. United States , 187 Ct.Cl . 376 , 408 F.2d 395 , 405 ( 1969 ) ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Balancing all of the secondary considerations , this court agrees with the district court that , in light of the strong evidence of obviousness based on the Pallmac and Visy prior art coupled with the near-simultaneous invention of the Tecasa machine , the Trust 's objective evidence of non-obviousness , even if fully credited by a jury , would fail to make a difference in this case . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ IV _NEWLINE_ The parties raise a number of other issues , including Martin 's standing with respect to damages , the district court 's denial of the Trust 's Rule 50 ( b ) motion on infringement , and the district court 's ruling as a matter of law that the Trust failed to establish willful infringement . Because the asserted claims of the ¡¬566 patent are invalid , those remaining issues are moot . The district court 's judgment is affirmed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ AFFIRMED _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 618 F.3d 1294 , 96 U.S.P.Q.2d 1212 _NEWLINE_ Footnotes _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ * _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Randall R.

The '532 patent describes and claims a food package that , after opening , can be resealed to maintain the freshness of the food items inside . Kraft brought this patent-infringement suit against Kellogg North America Co. , Keebler Foods Co. , and affiliates ( collectively , Kellogg ) in the Northern District of Illinois . The district court held that Kellogg was entitled to summary judgment of invalidity for obviousness of the asserted claims of the '532 patent . Intercontinental Great Brands LLC v. Kellogg N. Am . Co. , 118 F.Supp.3d 1022 , 1027-42 ( N.D. Ill. 2015 ) . The court also held that Kraft was entitled to summary judgment rejecting Kellogg 's counterclaim of unenforceability of the patent due to alleged inequitable conduct by Kraft , chiefly in an ex parte reexamination proceeding . Id . at 1044-45 . We affirm . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I _NEWLINE_ The '532 patent describes a combination of two known kinds of packaging . One , common for cookies , uses a frame surrounded by a wrapper . The other , common for wet wipes , uses a package on which the label may be pulled back to access the contents , then put back in place to reseal the package to preserve the items remaining inside . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Thus , the background section of the patent begins : `` Containers for food products such as cookies and other snacks typically include a frame surrounded by an outer wrapper . The frame acts as a tray to hold the food product and to protect the food product from damage . '' '532 patent , col. 1 , lines 12-15 . A person wanting to consume some but not all of the items in the package `` normally '' does so `` by opening one end of the wrapper , withdrawing the tray from the inside thereof , and then removing the food product from the tray . '' Id. , col. 1 , lines 15-18 . `` [ T ] hese containers , '' however , `` generally do not provide a convenient opening and reclosing arrangement . For example , reclosing of the wrapper , once opened , generally includes simply folding or rolling the end down and clip-ping the end to keep the wrapper closed . '' Id. , col. 1 , lines 19-23 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ At the same time , `` [ r ] eclosable seals have been used for dispensing bags for wet tissue or disposable cleaning wipes . '' Id. , col. 1 , lines 24-25 . `` The label on these bags can be pulled back thereby exposing an opening , allowing access to the wet tissues or wipes inside . '' Id. , col. 1 , lines 25-27 . `` Typically , '' however , `` these dispensing bags '' lack a rigid internal structure , i.e. , `` are completely flexible , formed exclusively of a plastic or other suitable flexible material which closely surrounds the pack of wet tissues or wipes . '' Id. , col. 1 , lines 27-30 . Lacking an internal rigid structure , `` such known dispensing bags are not well suited for containing food products as *1340 these containers fail to provide adequate protection for storing food products . '' Id. , col. 1 , lines 34-36 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The patent then introduces the invention : _NEWLINE_ The purpose of the present invention is to provide a new and improved container for food products such as rigid food articles , for example cookies and the like , which container provides adequate protection for the contents thereof , while concurrently facilitating opening of the container wrapper and resealing the seal to protect the contents thereof until the contents are fully consumed . _NEWLINE_ Id. , col. 1 , lines 39-46 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Claim 1 , which is largely representative for purposes of this appeal , recites as follows : _NEWLINE_ 1 . A polygonal shaped food container comprising : _NEWLINE_ a frame defining the polygonal shape of the container , said container having a top , a bottom [ , ] and sides connecting the top and bottom , the frame containing a food product comprised of discrete food articles ; _NEWLINE_ a wrapper surrounding said frame , said wrapper forming the top [ , ] sides [ , ] and bottom of the container ; _NEWLINE_ said top having an access opening sufficiently large to provide hand access to substantially all of the discrete food articles contained within the frame , such that substantially any one of the discrete food articles can be accessed and removed individually through said access opening ; and _NEWLINE_ a sealing layer , adhesively sealed to said top around said opening , said sealing layer including a starter portion located near a side of the top which can be grasped by a user , said sealing layer being releasable when said starter portion is pulled in a direction away from said side to in turn pull and thereby release at least a portion of said sealing layer to provide the hand access to said top access opening and reclosable against said top to seal said opening when said sealing layer is moved back against the said top . _NEWLINE_ Id. , col. 5 , lines 29-51 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In October 2007 , about two years after the '532 patent issued , a Swedish company that produces resealable packages sought an ex parte reexamination of that patent from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office . Intercontinental , 118 F.Supp.3d at 1026 . The Office initiated the reexamination , and in April 2010 , the examiner ( in the central reexamination unit ) rejected all claims except two of the claims that Kraft added ( to which the examiner objected ) , relying centrally on a short 2001 article in Packaging News that displayed and described Re-Seal It packaging made by a Swedish firm and marketed by Paramount Packaging . In August 2011 , however , the Patent Trial and Appeal Board reversed all of the rejections . It relied critically on a particular phrase in the Packaging News article asserting the conventionality of the wrapping film to distinguish the Kraft patent claims-a phrase that does not appear in the descriptions of Paramount Re-Seal It packaging in the distinct prior-art articles that became central in the present litigation . Ex Parte Kraft Foods Global Brands LLC. , No . 2011-005770 , 2011 WL 3754634 ( P.T.A.B . Aug. 19 , 2011 ) . The resulting reexamination certificate contained the original claims 1-25 and new claims 26-67 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In 2013 , Kraft sued Kellogg for infringement of a number of claims of the '532 patent . In particular , Kraft alleged that Kellogg infringed by making , using , selling , and offering certain resealable cookie packages that a Kellogg document suggested were designed to `` 'circumvent [ ] the Kraft patent while maintaining similar properties . ' `` Intercontinental , 118 F.Supp.3d at 1026 ( alteration in original ) . *1341 Kellogg responded by alleging , among other things , that the asserted claims of the '532 patent were invalid for obviousness and that the patent was unenforceable due to inequitable conduct by Kraft before the Board in securing reversal of the examiner 's rejections during reexamination . Kellogg eventually moved for summary judgment of invalidity , and Kraft moved for summary judgment on Kellogg 's counterclaim of unenforceability due to inequitable conduct.1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court granted Kellogg 's motion for summary judgment of invalidity of all of the asserted claims ( 1 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 26 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 39 , and 42 ) under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 ( 2006 ) .2 As the patent itself makes clear , the `` frame '' element is shown by prior art , such as U.S. Patent No . 3,740,238 issued to Graham , which discloses a traditional cookie package with a frame to hold the cookies , described as prior art in the '532 patent . And while the patent makes clear that non-food prior art showed a peel-back resealable package without a rigid structure ( packaging for wet wipes ) , what the patent does not show , but the record in this litigation reveals , is prior art showing a peel-back resealable package with a rigid tray for food items ( `` such as '' discrete items like sushi and canapes ) -namely , two related articles in the Machinery Update publication describing and showing a Re-Seal It package marketed in Britain by Paramount Packaging as an agent for Real-Seal It Sweden . See Machinery Update , March/April 2002 at 59-60 ( J.A . 4423-24 ) ; Machinery Update , September/October 2001 at 46-47 ( J.A . 4708-09 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ First , considering independent claims 1 and 34 , the district court concluded that the record put beyond reasonable dispute that all claim elements except the `` frame '' element were shown in the Machinery Update articles and the `` frame '' element was shown in the prior art of cookie packaging , such as the Graham patent . Intercontinental , 118 F.Supp.3d at 1030-34 . The court then determined that the only reasonable inference on the record was that a relevant skilled artisan would have been motivated to combine those prior-art references . The court specifically stressed that the absence of a `` convenient opening and reclosing arrangement '' was a `` known problem '' for cookie packaging and that the Machinery Update resealable , tray-included packaging for foods offered a skilled artisan a solution to the problem simply by replacing the Machinery Update `` tray '' with a frame , i.e. , a tray with higher sides . More generally , the court considered the simple and clear teachings of the art , the importance of common sense and ordinary creativity , and the conclusory character of Kraft 's expert 's assertions of nonobviousness . Id . at 1034-38 . The court next analyzed the various dependent claims , finding no basis for a different conclusion about the art-based portion of the obviousness analysis . Id . at 1038-41 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Finally , the court concluded that Kraft 's evidence of certain objective indicia , though substantial , was simply not entitled to such weight in the ultimate legal assessment *1342 of obviousness as to produce a bottom-line conclusion of anything but invalidity . Id . at 1041-42 . In particular , the court determined that Kraft had strong evidence of commercial success tied to the patent-claimed packaging , industry praise , and copying by Kellogg . Id . at 1041 . Nevertheless , the court concluded , `` this is a case in which the secondary considerations do not overcome Kellogg 's extremely strong prima facie showing that the invention was obvious in light of Machinery Update . '' Id . The court explained : _NEWLINE_ In this case , the prior art references teach all of the claim limitations-all of the elements could be found in existing food packaging technology . In fact , nearly all of the elements were found in one Machinery Update article , and the rest already existed in cookie packages . Additionally , the technology is relatively simple . Based on these considerations , a person skilled in the art would have a reason to combine the elements to create the invention . In sum , the primary considerations lead to a conclusion that the invention was obvious in light of the prior art , and [ Intercontinental 's ] strong showing of secondary considerations does not outweigh this determination . _NEWLINE_ In sum , based on the undisputed facts , all of the asserted claims are invalid as obvious in light of Machinery Update when combined with existing cookie packages . _NEWLINE_ Id . at 1042 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ With regard to Kellogg 's unenforceability challenge to the '532 patent , based chiefly on alleged inequitable conduct by Kraft in the reexamination proceeding , the court granted Kraft 's motion for summary judgment rejecting the challenge . Id . at 1044-45 . The court explained that the charge of inequitable conduct during reexamination did not and could not rest on withholding by Kraft of material prior art ; in particular , `` [ i ] t is undisputed that [ the 2002 ] Machinery Update [ article ] ... [ was ] presented during reexamination . '' Id . at 1044 . The court then addressed Kellogg 's key charge-that Kraft 's counsel did not tell the Patent and Trademark Office ( PTO ) that the phrase in the Packaging News article about the conventionality of the wrapping film , on which the Board came to rely in upholding Kraft 's claims , was actually a misprint , as allegedly made evident by the opposite characterization of the film used in Re-Seal It packaging in the 2002 Machinery Update article . The district court , while agreeing that the phrase in Packaging News likely was a misprint , concluded that Kraft 's counsel `` merely restated the contents of the misprinted article '' and `` [ t ] here is no evidence that the attorney knowingly failed to identify the inconsistency between the two articles .

'' Randall , 733 F.3d at 1362 . `` [ T ] he Court required an analysis that reads the prior art in context , taking account of 'demands known to the design community , ' 'the background knowledge possessed by a person having ordinary skill in the art , ' and 'the inferences and creative steps that a person of ordinary skill in the art would employ . ' `` Id . ( quoting KSR , 550 U.S. at 418 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 ) . A `` court must ask whether the [ claimed ] improvement is more than the predictable use '' -a `` predictable variation '' - '' of prior art elements according to their established functions , '' considering whether more is involved than `` the simple substitution of one known element for another or the mere application of a known technique to a piece of prior art ready for the improvement . '' KSR , 550 U.S. at 417 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 . `` [ I ] f a technique has been used to improve one device , and a person of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that it would improve similar devices in the same way , using the technique is obvious unless its actual application is beyond his or her skill . '' Id . at 417 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 . The court should consider a range of real-world facts to determine `` whether there was an apparent reason to combine the known elements in the fashion claimed by the patent at issue .

'' Id . at 419-20 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Depending on the record , summary judgment of invalidity for obviousness may be appropriate . The Supreme Court ordered summary judgment in KSR after a careful determination of the facts put beyond genuine dispute by the record , and it explained that `` a conclusory affidavit addressing the question of obviousness '' does not `` exclude the possibility of summary judgment . '' Id . at 426 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 . Rather : _NEWLINE_ In considering summary judgment on that question the district court can and should take into account expert testimony , which may resolve or keep open certain questions of fact . That is not the end of the issue , however . The ultimate judgment of obviousness is a legal determination . Graham , 383 U.S. at 17 [ 86 S.Ct . 684 ] . Where , as here , the content of the prior art , the scope of the patent claim , and the level of ordinary skill in the art are not in material dispute , and the obviousness of the claim is apparent in light of these factors , summary judgment is appropriate . _NEWLINE_ Id . at 427 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 . Based on the required close examinations of case-specific records , this court , since KSR , has sometimes held summary judgment of obviousness unwarranted5 and sometimes *1345 held it warranted.6 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In this case , we conclude , the district court correctly determined that summary judgment was warranted on the record , for the reasons we have summarized in describing the district court 's opinion . Kraft 's arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 _NEWLINE_ Kraft turns first to the objective indicia ( secondary considerations ) bearing on obviousness . Kraft 's Opening Br . 38-42 . It contends that the district court treated the objective indicia as an `` afterthought , '' `` writing off the patent before turning to objective indicia , '' and `` repeatedly not [ ing ] its finding of obviousness before considering the objective indicia . '' Id . at 38 , 40 , 41 . That contention mischaracterizes the district court 's reasoning , which followed a sequence that accords with KSR , Graham , and this court 's precedents . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court drew its conclusion of obviousness only after , not before , considering the objective indicia . Intercontinental , 118 F.Supp.3d at 1042 . Before reviewing the objective indicia , the court concluded only that Kellogg had made a `` strong prima facie showing of obviousness . '' Intercontinental , 118 F.Supp.3d at 1037-38 ( `` Because there is no genuine dispute that all elements of claims 1 and 34 are disclosed in the prior art and it would have been predictable for a person of skill in the art to combine those elements , Kellogg has made a strong prima facie showing of obviousness as to independent claims 1 and 34 . `` ) ; see id . at 1038-41 ( same for asserted dependent claims ) . As its opinion shows , id . at 1034-37 , the court drew that conclusion based on the Graham factors directed to identifying the teachings of the prior art , as well as the considerations this court has identified as bearing on the question of motivation to combine . See , e.g. , Plantronics , 724 F.3d at 1354 ( `` [ M ] otivation to combine may be found explicitly or implicitly in market forces ; design incentives ; the 'interrelated teachings of multiple patents ' ; 'any need or problem known in the field of endeavor at the time of invention and addressed by the patent ' ; and the background knowledge , creativity , and common sense of the person of ordinary skill . '' ) ( citing Perfect Web , 587 F.3d at 1328-29 ( quoting KSR , 550 U.S. at 418-21 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 ) ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The court thus did not draw an ultimate conclusion regarding obviousness before considering the objective indicia . The contrary is not shown by the court 's not-uncommon choice of words when conducting the ultimate weighing , namely , that the objective indicia `` do not overcome Kellogg 's extremely strong prima facie showing . '' *1346 Intercontinental , 118 F.Supp.3d at 1041 . See , e.g. , Ohio Willow , 735 F.3d at 1344 ( similar usage ) ; Perfect Web , 587 F.3d at 1333 ( similar ) ; cf . KSR , 550 U.S. at 426 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 ( secondary considerations do not `` dislodge '' the determination that the claim would have been obvious ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ While withholding a conclusion as to obviousness until considering the objective indicia , the district court did draw the following conclusions before such consideration : `` there was a known problem in the cookie packaging industry , and all of the elements of the invention existed in the prior art '' ; `` [ a ] packaging expert , with knowledge of existing food packaging technology , would have thought to combine a resealable container and a frame big enough to contain cookies '' ; and the claimed `` combination 'would have been entirely predictable and grounded in common sense . ' `` Intercontinental , 118 F.Supp.3d at 1035 ( quoting Ball Aerosol & Specialty Container , 555 F.3d at 992-93 ) . The court then concluded ( before discussing objective indicia ) : `` No reasonable jury could conclude that a person skilled in packaging design would not be motivated to combine these features . '' Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Kraft contends that objective indicia must be evaluated before drawing a conclusion about whether a reasonable jury could find that a relevant skilled artisan had a motivation to combine the prior art , not merely before drawing the ultimate obviousness conclusion . But it cites no precedent so holding . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Kraft does cite authorities confirming that , in some cases , objective indicia can be important evidence of obviousness , sometimes even the most important evidence . See , e.g. , Plantronics , 724 F.3d at 1355 ; Crocs , Inc. v. Int ' l Trade Comm ' n , 598 F.3d 1294 , 1310 ( Fed . Cir . 2010 ) . And it cites authorities that say , consistent with KSR and Graham , that objective indicia must be considered and given `` fair weight '' before a legal conclusion on obviousness is drawn . Demaco Corp. v. F. Von Langsdorff Licensing Ltd. , 851 F.2d 1387 , 1391 ( Fed . Cir . 1988 ) ; see Leo Pharm . Prods. , Ltd. v. Rea , 726 F.3d 1346 , 1357-58 ( Fed . Cir . 2013 ) ; Plantronics , 724 F.3d at 1355 ; Power Integrations , Inc. v. Fairchild Semiconductor Int ' l , Inc. , 711 F.3d 1348 , 1368 ( Fed . Cir . 2013 ) ; In re Cyclobenzaprine Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsule Patent Litig. , 676 F.3d 1063 , 1076 ( Fed . Cir . 2012 ) ; see also Apple , 839 F.3d at 1058 ; Kinetic Concepts , Inc. v. Smith & Nephew , Inc. , 688 F.3d 1342 , 1368-71 ( Fed . Cir . 2012 ) ; Ecolochem , Inc. v. S. Cal . Edison Co. , 227 F.3d 1361 , 1380-81 ( Fed . Cir . 2000 ) . But the district court here did just that . And Kraft cites no authority that requires consideration of objective indicia as part of the motivation-to-combine factual analysis . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The staged consideration undertaken by the district court , and reflected in our cases , makes sense within the motivation-to-combine framework , a framework with which Kraft does not take issue . When a challenger shows that a `` motivation '' existed for a relevant skilled artisan to combine prior art in the way claimed in the patent at issue , such a showing commonly supports and leads readily to the further , ultimate determination that such an artisan , using ordinary creativity , would actually have found the claimed invention obvious . But the latter conclusion does not follow automatically from the former finding , and additional evidence may prevent drawing it . Identification of a `` motivation '' to make the combination may not give a complete picture of what a skilled artisan , exercising ordinary creativity without the incentive of patent protection , would actually have found it obvious to `` disclose [ ] or devise [ ] '' at the relevant time . See Graham , 383 U.S. at 11 , 86 S.Ct . 684 ( explaining that when Congress *1347 adopted ¡± 103 , and even before , `` [ t ] he inherent problem was to develop some means of weeding out those inventions which would not be disclosed or devised but for the inducement of a patent '' ) . Even with a motivation proved , the record may reveal reasons that , after all , the court should not conclude that the combination would have been obvious , i.e. , already part of the public domain.7 One type of such additional evidence consists of evidence of objective indicia-commercial success traceable to the claimed invention , industry praise , copying , and certain other facts concerning people 's actions and statements . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This way of structuring the analysis implements the requirement that the approach to determining obviousness be `` expansive '' and `` flexible . '' See KSR , 550 U.S. at 415 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 . It reflects an understanding of the role of `` motivation '' that fits our consistent treatment of that element of the analysis as factual in nature . And it fits the Supreme Court 's treatment of objective indicia as evidence to be weighed in the overall legal determination of obviousness . We see no error in the sequence of steps the district court took in arriving at its ultimate obviousness determination . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Kraft 's only argument about the objective indicia thus fails . Kraft can not complain that the district court failed to credit its evidence regarding objective indicia : the district court accepted the facts Kraft asserted about commercial success , industry praise , and copying . What remains for the objective indicia , therefore , is a weighing to produce a legal conclusion . But Kraft does not additionally argue to us , certainly not in a meaningful way , that in this particular case the objective indicia accepted by the district court require a legal conclusion of nonobviousness if we agree with the district court as to the prior-art and motivation-to-combine elements of the analysis . Any implicit , undeveloped suggestion to that effect by Kraft is not enough on the record here , given the strength of the record on those elements , including the simplicity of the technology and combination at issue , the recognized problem of resealing for cookie packaging , and the strong teaching of the prior art just before the claimed priority date . See , e.g. , Ohio Willow , 735 F.3d at 1344 ( `` [ W ] here a claimed invention represents no more than the predictable use of prior art elements according to established functions , as here , evidence of secondary indicia are frequently deemed inadequate to establish nonobviousness. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 2 _NEWLINE_ Kraft next argues that the district court improperly resolved genuine factual disputes . The district court concluded that the following were the only reasonable findings on the record : the Machinery Update articles ( published shortly before Kraft 's priority date ) disclose all the elements of the claims in combination-including , notably , a pull-back resealable package for discrete food items with a rigid tray-except the required `` frame '' that was common for cookies , as shown by Graham ; the absence of a satisfactory resealable package was a known problem for cookies ; and the ordinary creativity of the relevant skilled packaging artisan motivated and made predictable the use of the Machinery Update package with a cookie-protecting frame as a solution to that known problem . Kraft has not shown any *1348 basis in the record for reasonable contrary findings . Those findings , in this case , suffice to justify the overall legal conclusion of obviousness , there being no meaningful argument that the objective indicia , when weighed in Kraft 's favor ( as the district court did ) , can change the ultimate conclusion . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Kraft argues that the district court failed to provide `` explicit and clear reasoning providing some rational underpinning '' for its invocation of common sense in its motivation-to-combine analysis . Kraft 's Opening Br . 43 ( quoting Plantronics , 724 F.3d at 1354 ) . We disagree . The court relied on the record demonstrating the `` known problem '' of an insufficiently `` convenient opening and reclosing arrangement '' for cookie packaging and the suggestion in Machinery Update itself that its packaging , with a tray , was usable for a variety of foods , `` such as '' discrete items like sushi and canapes . Intercontinental , 118 F.Supp.3d at 1035-36 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Kraft also points to the absence of expert testimony for Kellogg on this point . Kraft 's Opening Br . 43 . But we have recognized that some cases involve technologies and prior art that are simple enough that no expert testimony is needed . See Wyers , 616 F.3d at 1239 ( `` KSR and our later cases establish that the legal determination of obviousness may include recourse to logic , judgment , and common sense , in lieu of expert testimony . `` ) ; Perfect Web , 587 F.3d at 1329 ; Sundance , Inc. v. DeMonte Fabricating Ltd. , 550 F.3d 1356 , 1365 ( Fed . Cir . 2008 ) . What is claimed and described in the '532 patent-which does not include any new manufacturing equipment or instructions to produce the described and claimed packaging-makes this such a case . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Kraft next contends that the evidence in the record shows that there was more than one reasonable inference about whether a relevant skilled artisan had a motivation to use the Machinery Update packaging with a frame for cookies . Kraft begins by relying on the assertion that `` Kellogg personnel rejected the idea of combining a traditional cookie package with the resealable technology '' of the Machinery Update articles . Kraft 's Opening Br . 45 . But the record does not support the suggested inference . At best , the cited deposition testimony could establish that a group of Kellogg employees viewed a sample of the Re-Seal It packaging technology at an internal meeting along with other packaging samples brought back from a trade show and Kellogg did not immediately adopt the technology for cookies . See J.A . 6328-29 , 6347 , 6366-69 . But the only evidence in the record about the reason behind that initial decision is that Kellogg did not possess the required equipment and did not then wish to purchase new equipment . J.A . 6329 . One company 's temporary decision about an equipment investment is not sufficient to defeat the otherwise-compelled inference that combining the Re-Seal It packaging with familiar cookie-package frames ( as in Graham ) was a predictable technological solution to the relevant known market problem . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Kraft does not dispute , as its own evidence recited by the district court confirms , that the invention disclosed in its patent helps solve a known problem with cookie packaging ( experienced by those consumers who want the option of eating less than a full package of cookies in one sitting ) . Intercontinental , 118 F.Supp.3d at 1035 . The packaging in the Machinery Update articles , with an internal tray to protect the contents and convenient resealing functionality , and its suggestion of use for a variety of discrete food items , makes readily predictable its use for cookies by raising the sides of the tray to form a `` frame . '' Kraft points to statements by its packaging expert ( or Kraft filings based on *1349 such statements ) as allegedly supporting a contrary finding . Kraft 's Opening Br . 46-52 ( citing portions of J.A . 1769-75 , 6134-35 , 6146-53 , 6156 , 6159-60 , 6163-64 6166-67 ) . But the expert 's statements in this case are insufficient to support a reasonable contrary finding . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Kraft 's expert , especially in the PTO , devoted relatively little attention to the Machinery Update articles . He focused instead on the Packaging News article , which ( unlike the Machinery Update articles ) stated that the Re-Seal It packaging described and shown did not use conventional wrapping-the statement that led the Board on reexamination to reverse the examiner 's rejection of Kraft 's claims . Regardless , to the extent that his statements apply directly or indirectly to the Machinery Update packaging , they rest on misreadings of the articles and disregard of the plain significance of other evidence from Kraft itself . See Novartis Corp. v. Ben Venue Labs. , Inc. , 271 F.3d 1043 , 1050-51 ( Fed . Cir . 2001 ) ( determining that expert declaration not based on reasonable inferences from the material record facts amounts to a conclusory opinion insufficient to prevent summary judgment ) ; see also Scott , 550 U.S. at 380 , 127 S.Ct . 1769 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ For example , the expert suggested that the Machinery Update articles are focused on layered items like sliced meats and suggest use of a tray only to be removed from the side of the package , not for items like cookies to be accessed from the top by peeling back the resealable flap . Kraft 's Opening Br . 46-52 . But the district court correctly explained why the Machinery Update articles do teach top access to trays with unstacked discrete items , giving sushi and canapes as mere examples ( `` such as '' ) , as well as parallel perimeter portions at the top for the sealing layer to stick to . Intercontinental , 118 F.Supp.3d at 1030-34 . We fail to see any other reasonable reading of the Machinery Update articles on these points.8 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Likewise , the expert noted `` many reclosure variations , '' as Kraft summarizes the point , such as `` tin ties , twist ties , adhesive tape for reclosing one end , a clip to pinch the end of the package , a zipper strip added to the end or side of the package , and a pinch seal strip added to an end or side of the package . '' Kraft Opening Br . 47 . But as far as the record shows , those were among the very alternatives in the prior art that left consumers with the `` known problem '' with cookie packaging that motivated turning to the resealable Machinery Update packaging . Such known-to-be-unsatisfactory alternatives provide no basis for questioning the predictability of picking out the Machinery Update packaging as a new solution to the known problem . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Kraft asserts , based on declarations submitted to the PTO ( relied on by its expert in this case ) , that `` [ a ] skilled artisan would not add a reclosure feature to Graham because it is designed for one-time use , by 'opening at one of its ends , ' `` and `` the Graham tray is inexpensive and 'resiliently flexible ' to conform to the cookies , '' whereas the Packaging News packaging `` is designed for multiple openings and reclosings '' and its `` tray is expensive , 'significantly more rigid , ' and 'not conformable to the food products . ' `` Kraft 's Opening Br . 46 . But those assertions provide no *1350 reasonable basis for denying the predictability of using prior-art cookie frames like Graham 's in the Machinery Update packaging . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ It was a `` known problem '' for cookie consumers that Graham-like packages did not satisfactorily provide for the `` multiple openings and closings '' that consumers wanted-and that the Machinery Update packaging made more convenient . As Kraft says , `` [ c ] onsumer dissatisfaction with this traditional frame-in-wrapper package was well-known . '' Id . at 4 . That is what motivated looking to the multiple-use Machinery Update packaging . Moreover , Kraft points to no evidence that the Graham-like frames would not work with the Machinery Update packaging . Nor does the relied-on testimony say anything actually material about cost : it does not say that the resulting cookie package would cost cookie consumers more than the prior-art cookie package or that any increase would be sufficient to deter the combination . The expert 's only point about cost was that the cookie frame was less expensive than the Machinery Update tray . But that point says nothing to the effect that the relevant ( cookie ) consumers would face a cost increase were the cookie makers to use the old frame but replace the surrounding wrappers with the Machinery Update package . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On this record , we conclude , there is no basis for overturning the district court 's conclusion that any reasonable jury would have to find a motivation to combine . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 3 _NEWLINE_ Kraft 's final argument invokes this court 's recognition that a `` party challenging validity shoulders an enhanced burden if the invalidity argument relies on the same prior art considered during examination . '' Tokai , 632 F.3d at 1367 . According to Kraft , that proposition applies here based on the reexamination , in which Graham , the 2002 Machinery Update article , and the Packaging News article ( containing the same photograph as appeared in the 2001 Machinery Update article ) were considered . See Kraft Opening Br . 56-60 . It suffices to say , however , that in this case the `` enhanced burden '' proposition provides no basis for a different result . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The `` enhanced burden '' point certainly confirms a practical truth about litigation : persuading a fact finder that an expert agency is incorrect on a proposition is likely to be a greater forensic challenge to the advocate than showing the proposition to be incorrect in the absence of a contrary expert-agency determination . See Sciele Pharma Inc. v. Lupin Ltd. , 684 F.3d 1253 , 1260-61 ( Fed . Cir . 2012 ) ( `` [ I ] t may be harder to meet the clear and convincing burden when the invalidity contention is based upon the same argument on the same reference that the PTO already considered . Importantly , whether a reference was before the PTO goes to the weight of the evidence , and the parties are of course free to , and generally do , make these arguments to the fact finder. '' ) . This court has not , however , ascribed any larger meaning to the `` enhanced burden '' point , which , the court has explained , does not mean that something more than clear and convincing evidence is required . Id . In any event , this is not a case in which what the PTO concluded makes a difference , for at least two reasons . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ First , as the district court explained , the only express analysis of the Machinery Update articles was by the examiner , who rejected the claims . The Board , which upheld the claims , did not expressly consider those articles , but relied instead on a sentence in Packaging News that does not appear in the Machinery Update articles . Intercontinental , 118 F.Supp.3d at 1028-29 . There is no basis for attributing to the *1351 Board an implied assessment of the Machinery Update articles . The record before the Board indicates that the Board simply accepted a premise that those articles were redundant of Packaging News , requiring no separate consideration . There is no specific PTO determination of nonobviousness based on the particular prior art now at issue . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Second , in this case , we think that the showing of obviousness is sufficiently strong that no PTO contrary determination could alter the conclusion about summary judgment . If the substantive evidentiary and other arguments made by Kraft do not create a triable issue , as we ( and the district court ) have concluded , neither could a bare assumption , otherwise unexplained , that the PTO reached a different conclusion based on the prior art here at issue . For that reason as well , we reject Kraft 's final deference-invoking argument against summary judgment of obviousness . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ * * * _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In Tokai , this court drew the following conclusion on the record before it in affirming a summary judgment of obviousness : `` [ T ] he undisputed facts in this case-including the state of the prior art , the simplicity and availability of the components making up the claimed invention , and an explicit need in the prior art for [ the asserted invention ] -compel a conclusion of obviousness as to the subject matter of each of the asserted claims . '' 632 F.3d at 1371 . For the reasons we have set forth , we agree with the district court that the same conclusion is warranted in this case . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B _NEWLINE_ In its cross-appeal , Kellogg argues that the district court erred when it granted Kraft summary judgment rejecting Kellogg 's inequitable-conduct charge.9 The only issue here concerns the arguments Kraft made about Packaging News to the Board during reexamination . We see no reversible error in the district court 's conclusion that Kellogg 's evidence was insufficient to permit a finding of the intent required for inequitable conduct based on Kraft 's reexamination arguments . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Kellogg 's charge rests on a sentence in the Packaging News article-a short article that was the central focus before the Board , including during oral argument , when the Board was specifically looking at and asking about the brief text . The relevant sentence in that article describes the Re-Seal It packaging as not using `` conventional wrapping film . '' J.A . 4713 . Kellogg says that the sentence is a misprint and that Kraft committed inequitable conduct by not so informing the Board . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ There is no doubt that the Packaging Material sentence was important to the Board 's decision : the Board relied on that sentence to reverse the examiner 's rejections of Kraft 's claims . But to prevail , Kellogg had to prove that Kraft , in what it did not say about the sentence that was the focus of the Board 's attention , had a `` specific intent to mislead or deceive the PTO . '' In re Rosuvastatin Calcium Patent Litig. , 703 F.3d 511 , 519 ( Fed . Cir . 2012 ) ( citing Therasense , 649 F.3d at 1287 ) . The intent requirement is demanding : the evidence must be `` sufficient to require a finding of deceitful intent in the light of all the circumstances '' ; deceptive intent `` must be the single most reasonable inference able to be drawn from the evidence '' ; and `` when there are multiple reasonable inferences that may be drawn , intent to deceive can not be found . '' Therasense , 649 F.3d at 1290-91 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) ; *1352 see Ohio Willow , 735 F.3d at 1351 ; Ohio Willow Wood Co. v. Alps South , LLC , 813 F.3d 1350 , 1358-59 ( Fed . Cir . 2016 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Unlike Ohio Willow , this is not a case of withholding documents from the PTO ( in Ohio Willow , documents key to corroboration of inventorship ) or of making affirmative misrepresentations ( in Ohio Willow , about a key participant 's supposed admission somewhere in the record ) . The Board had the 2002 Machinery Update article in the record , but it was not a basis for the examiner 's rejections on review and so was not the subject of any discussion before the Board.10 The alleged wrong , moreover , is not what Kraft affirmatively stated about Packaging News . The only alleged wrong is Kraft 's omission of any statement that the sentence in the Packaging News reference on which the Board was directly focusing was actually a misprint . But even if the sentence was a misprint , the district court properly concluded that the record does not support an inference of deceptive intent under the Therasense standard . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Kellogg presents no admission or anything similar indicating that any relevant Kraft officer or representative during the reexamination actually believed the sentence to be a misprint . Kellogg asks for an inference as to what Kraft had to believe , given the disparity of language between the Packaging News article ( `` without conventional wrapping film , '' J.A . 4713 ) and the 2002 Machinery Update article ( `` with conventional wrapping film , '' J.A . 4424 ) , that Kraft 's counsel had read both articles , and that a representative of a company selling packaging machines that counts Kraft as one of its biggest customers ( affiliated with the reexamination requester ) testified that , since `` we run with conventional film , '' it was obvious that the Packaging News sentence was a misprint , J.A . 6427 , 6441 . But without more evidence of Kraft 's belief , one reasonable inference on the record-especially given Kellogg 's burden of persuasion-is that Kraft did not believe that there was a misprint . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Kellogg 's evidence from the deposition of Kraft 's counsel provides no suggestion of any awareness of a misprint . See J.A . 6941-45 . The same is true as to Kraft 's inventor-appearing also as Kraft 's official company witness under Fed . R. Civ . P. 30 ( b ) ( 6 ) -who testified that she did not recognize a misprint in Packaging News at all , much less one based on the difference in language between it and the 2002 Machinery Update , believing that `` they were different packaging in different articles , '' J.A . 6388 , and that if there had been a misprint , it would have been corrected , J.A . 6382-83 . In the reexamination , moreover , neither the ex parte requester nor the examiner suggested that the Packaging News article contained a misprint . The absence of such a statement indicates that the alleged misprint was not as obvious as Kellogg claims . The rejections that were then appealed did not involve Machinery Update , which therefore need not have been the subject of reinspection by Kraft during the appeal . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In these circumstances , we think that the district court properly concluded that the Therasense intent standard could not be met . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ III _NEWLINE_ For the foregoing reasons , we affirm the judgment of the district court . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ No costs awarded to either party . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ AFFIRMED _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1353 Reyna , Circuit Judge , dissenting-in-part . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ For too long , this court has turned a blind eye to what I consider to be a grave concern : the application of a prima facie test that necessarily achieves a legal determination of obviousness prior to full and fair consideration of evidence of objective indicia of non-obviousness.1 There should be no prima facie rule or test in the obviousness inquiry . Stated differently , the burden of persuasion should not shift from the challenger to the patent holder after a legal determination of obviousness has already been made . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I agree with the majority 's decision to affirm the district court 's grant of summary judgment of no inequitable conduct . Thus , I join Part IIB of the majority opinion . I disagree , however , with the majority 's decision that affirms the district court 's grant of summary judgment of obviousness . I would find that the district court improperly found a prima facie case of obviousness before considering Kraft 's evidence of objective indicia of nonobviousness . I therefore respectfully dissent from Part IIA of the majority opinion . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Because the majority affirms on obviousness , it does not address the district court 's finding of no literal infringement . Because I believe the district court erred on obviousness , I would address the infringement issue . The district court changed its construction of the claim term `` sealing layer '' between its Markman order and summary judgment order , resulting in a conclusion of non-infringement . That midstream change was dispositive , and because Kraft had no opportunity to address the new construction , the district court 's summary judgment was erroneous . I dissent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A. Statutory Requirement of Non-Obviousness _NEWLINE_ In 1952 , Congress amended the Patent Act to , inter alia , require that patents be non-obvious . 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 ; 2 Donald S. Chisum , Chisum on Patents ¡± 5.02 [ 4 ] ( `` In Section 103 of the Patent Act of 1952 , Congress for the first time gave express legislative recognition to the judicially-developed doctrine that something more than strict novelty is required in order to support a patent. '' ) . Section 103 codified what the common law already had required for a century . See Hotchkiss v. M. Greenwood & Co. , 52 U.S. ( 11 How . ) 248 , 13 L.Ed . 683 ( 1850 ) . A claimed invention is unpatentable `` if the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art are such that the claimed invention as a whole would have been obvious before the effective filing date of the claimed invention to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which the claimed invention pertains . '' 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103.2 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1354 B . Supreme Court Precedent _NEWLINE_ The Supreme Court first addressed ¡± 103 in Graham v. John Deere Co. , 383 U.S. 1 , 86 S.Ct . 684 , 15 L.Ed.2d 545 ( 1966 ) . The Court set forth the framework for determining whether patent claims would have been obvious : _NEWLINE_ Under ¡± 103 , the scope and content of the prior art are to be determined ; differences between the prior art and the claims at issue are to be ascertained ; and the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art resolved . Against this background , the obviousness or nonobviousness of the subject matter is determined . Such secondary considerations as commercial success , long felt but unsolved needs , failure of others , etc. , might be utilized to give light to the circumstances surrounding the origin of the subject matter sought to be patented . As indicia of obviousness or nonobviousness , these inquiries may have relevancy . _NEWLINE_ Id . at 17-18 , 86 S.Ct . 684 ( citation omitted ) . The Court noted that objective indicia of non-obviousness are `` more susceptible of judicial treatment '' than the other `` highly technical facts '' relevant to an obviousness analysis . Id . at 36 , 86 S.Ct . 684 . Objective indicia `` may lend a helping hand to the judiciary '' that `` is most ill-fitted to discharge the technological duties cast upon it by patent legislation . '' Id . Objective indicia , the Court wrote , help guard against hindsight and `` the temptation to read into the prior art the teachings of the invention in issue . '' Id.3 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ More recently , the Supreme Court clarified the obviousness analysis in KSR International Co. v. Teleflex Inc. , 550 U.S. 398 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 , 167 L.Ed.2d 705 ( 2007 ) . It explained that trial courts must consider the four Graham factors to determine whether an asserted claim would have been obvious : ( 1 ) the scope and content of prior art ; ( 2 ) the differences between the prior art and asserted claims ; ( 3 ) the level of ordinary skill ; and ( 4 ) objective indicia of non-obviousness . KSR , 550 U.S. at 406 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 ( citing Graham , 383 U.S. at 17-18 , 86 S.Ct . 684 ) . The Court noted that `` the sequence of these questions might be reordered in any particular case . '' Id . at 407 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 . It also cautioned factfinders to consider `` the distortion caused by hindsight bias '' and `` be cautious of arguments reliant upon ex post reasoning . '' Id . at 421 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 . In KSR , however , the patentee 's minimal evidence of objective indicia did not `` dislodge '' the obviousness determination . Id . at 426 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 . Thus , the Supreme Court held that the asserted claim would have been obvious . Id.4 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ To be clear , nothing in Graham or KSR requires courts to analyze the first three Graham factors first , make a prima facie determination of obviousness , and only then examine objective indicia of non-obviousness . Such a prima facie framework excludes objective indicia in the primary *1355 analysis and artificially creates a heightened standard of proof for objective indicia . I am not aware of any Supreme Court authority that endorses-let alone requires-the prima facie framework . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ C. Federal Circuit Precedent _NEWLINE_ This court explained the basic obviousness analysis in Stratoflex , Inc. v. Aeroquip Corp. , 713 F.2d 1530 ( Fed . Cir . 1983 ) . In Stratoflex , the district court concluded that the claimed inventions were `` plainly obvious . '' 713 F.2d at 1539 . As a result , it refused to analyze objective indicia of non-obviousness . Id . We held that such an approach was error , noting that each Graham factor `` is but an aid '' in determining whether the claimed invention would have been obvious . Id . at 1537 . And although we discussed objective indicia after the other three Graham factors , we elaborated at length about their importance : _NEWLINE_ It is jurisprudentially inappropriate to disregard any relevant evidence on any issue in any case , patent cases included . Thus evidence rising out of the so-called `` secondary considerations '' must always when present be considered en route to a determination of obviousness . Indeed , evidence of secondary considerations may often be the most probative and cogent evidence in the record . It may often establish that an invention appearing to have been obvious in light of the prior art was not . It is to be considered as part of all the evidence , not just when the decisionmaker remains in doubt after reviewing the art . ... En route to a conclusion on obviousness , a court must not stop until all pieces of evidence on that issue have been fully considered and each has been given its appropriate weight . Along the way , some pieces will weigh more heavily than others , but decision should be held in abeyance , and doubt maintained , until all the evidence has had its say . _NEWLINE_ Id . at 1538-39 ( citations omitted ) . In light of the district court 's failure to consider the objective indicia , we did so in the first instance . Id . at 1539 . Giving `` full consideration '' of objective indicia such as alleged commercial success , industry praise , and long-felt but unmet need , we concluded that the claims would have been obvious and thus affirmed the district court under the harmless error rule . Id . at 1540 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ More recently , we discussed the role of objective indicia in Cyclobenzaprine , 676 F.3d at 1063 . In that case , the district court engaged in a three-step analysis to determine whether a certain drug extended-delivery method would have been obvious . First , under the heading `` Prior art , '' it described four prior art references . In re Cyclobenzaprine , 794 F.Supp.2d 517 , 534-35 ( D. Del . 2011 ) , rev 'd in part , 676 F.3d 1063 ( Fed . Cir . 2012 ) . In the next section , with the heading `` Prima facie case , '' the district court determined that `` a person of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to take a group of known elements to create an extended release version of cyclobenzaprine , and to have a reasonable expectation of success in doing so . '' Id . at 537 . It also concluded that certain properties and delivery methods would have been obvious . Id . at 536-37 . Only later , under the heading `` Secondary considerations , '' did the court analyze the patentee 's objective indicia of non-obviousness . Id . at 537 . Finding that the objective indicia did not `` overcome the prima facie case of obviousness , '' the district court granted summary judgment of obviousness . Id . at 536 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On appeal , we reversed the district court 's obviousness determination . We explained that the purpose of objective indicia of non-obviousness is to refute the evidence of obviousness . Cyclobenzaprine , 676 F.3d at 1077 . That a patent owner may submit this evidence on objective indicia *1356 does not mean , however , that the burden shifts to the patent owner to prove non-obviousness . Cyclobenzaprine , 676 F.3d at 1079-80 . The district court must consider all evidence , including objective indicia of non-obviousness , before making an ultimate conclusion of obviousness . Id . at 1080 . We criticized the district court for `` impos [ ing ] a burden-shifting framework in a context in which none exists . '' Id . at 1075 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In Cyclobenzaprine , we emphasized our earlier statement that `` 'evidence of secondary considerations may often be the most probative and cogent evidence in the record . It may often establish that an invention appearing to be obvious in light of the prior art was not . ' `` Id . at 1075-76 ( quoting Stratoflex , 713 F.2d at 1538 ) . We noted that some Federal Circuit opinions have used the `` prima facie '' and `` rebuttal '' language , but we cautioned that `` those cases should not be interpreted as establishing a formal burden-shifting framework . '' Id . at 1077 . Instead , we interpreted our precedent to hold that `` all evidence relevant to obviousness or nonobviousness [ must ] be considered , and considered collectively . '' Id . at 1078 . Objective indicia of non-obviousness , we stated , are not mere , after-the-fact considerations relegated to secondary status . Id . They are essential safeguards against hindsight bias . Id . at 1079 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ D. Post-Cyclobenzaprine Use Of Prima Facie Framework _NEWLINE_ After Cyclobenzaprine , some of this court 's decisions have continued to endorse the prima facie framework . See , e.g. , Cubist Pharm. , Inc. v. Hospira , Inc. , 805 F.3d 1112 , 1130 ( Fed . Cir . 2015 ) ( `` We sustain the district court 's determination that the secondary consideration evidence did not overcome the showing of obviousness based on the prior art . `` ) ; Novo Nordisk A/S v. Caraco Pharm . Labs. , Ltd. , 719 F.3d 1346 , 1353-54 ( Fed . Cir . 2013 ) ( `` The mere fact that the court conducted [ the obviousness ] analysis using terms such as 'overcome ' and 'prima facie ' does not necessarily imply that it shifted the burden of persuasion onto [ the patent owner ] . '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In light of mixed messages coming from our court-endorsement of a prima facie framework on one hand but insistence to view the evidence as a whole on the other-trial courts have continued to find a prima facie case of obviousness before turning to objective indicia as rebuttal evidence . Despite Cyclobenzaprine 's warnings , burden-shifting remains common among trial courts . See , e.g. , Bayer Pharma AG v. Watson Labs. , Inc. , 183 F.Supp.3d 579 , 589 ( D. Del . 2016 ) ( `` Under relevant law , once a prima facie case of obviousness has been established , the burden then shifts to the applicant to present evidence of secondary considerations of non-obviousness to overcome this prima facie showing . `` ) ; B-K Lighting , Inc. v. Vision3 Lighting , 930 F.Supp.2d 1102 , 1116-17 ( C.D . Cal . 2013 ) ( stating that the patent owner bears the burden of presenting evidence to rebut a prima facie case of obviousness ) ; Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Teva Pharm . USA , Inc. , 923 F.Supp.2d 602 , 675 ( D. Del . 2013 ) ( `` With [ the alleged infringer ] having met its burden to establish a prima facie case of obviousness , the Court will go on to consider the fourth Graham factor : facts regarding objective indicia of nonobviousness . `` ) ; Hitkansut LLC v. United States , 127 Fed.Cl . 101 , 113 ( 2016 ) ( stating that the patent owner `` incorrectly assumes that secondary considerations are part of [ the alleged infringer 's ] burden in proving obviousness . Instead , evidence of secondary considerations is in the nature of rebuttal evidence . ... A patentee typically comes forward with proof of secondary considerations of validity , or 'non-obviousness , ' in rebuttal to a patent challenger 's prima facie case of obviousness . '' ) *1357 ( alterations , quotation marks , and citation omitted ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ E. This Court 's `` Prima Facie '' Framework Does Not Comport With Supreme Court Precedent _NEWLINE_ Although this court highlighted the dangers associated with the prima facie framework in Cyclobenzaprine , we have not diligently instructed trial courts to abandon the framework altogether.5 The time to do so has come . One commentator has stated that `` Cyclobenzaprine was unrealistic '' if it intended to ban district courts from making prima facie findings of obviousness prior to consideration of objective indicia . Chisum ¡± 5.05 . I am not the first member of this court to state that such a ban is necessary . See Galderma Labs. , L.P. v. Tolmar , Inc. , 737 F.3d 731 , 748 ( Fed . Cir . 2013 ) ( Newman , J. , dissenting ) ( `` [ T ] he proper analysis of obviousness under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 requires that all evidence relevant to obviousness or nonobviousness be considered , and be considered collectively , without resort to presumptions of prima facie obviousness or burden-shifting . '' ) ( quotation marks omitted ) ; Wm . Wrigley Jr. Co. v. Cadbury Adams USA LLC , 683 F.3d 1356 , 1367 ( Fed . Cir . 2012 ) ( Newman , J. , dissenting ) ( `` The district court , holding that a prima facie case of obviousness was established on the prior art alone , shifted the burden of proof to the patentee to rebut the asserted , but improper , prima facie case with the evidence of commercial success and copying . This is a distortion of the burden of proof , which never leaves the challenger. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Objective indicia of non-obviousness must be considered from the outset , and the burden of proof should never leave the challenger . The purpose of our patent system is the promotion of the progress of science and useful arts . U.S. Const . art . 1 , ¡± 8 , cl . 8 . This purpose is undermined by premature findings of obviousness and over-invalidation of innovative patents . Novo Nordisk , 719 F.3d at 1365 ( Newman , J. , dissenting ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The prima facie approach to obviousness jumbles the proper order of operations . `` Prima facie '' refers to evidence that is `` [ s ] ufficient to establish a fact or raise a presumption unless disproved or rebutted . '' Prima Facie , Black 's Law Dictionary ( 10th ed . 2014 ) . Whether a party has made a prima facie case is a legal determination . See Takeda Chem . Indus. , Ltd. v. Alphapharm Pty. , 492 F.3d 1350 , 1356 ( Fed . Cir . 2007 ) ( calling the prima facie test `` consistent with the legal principles enunciated in KSR '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Consistent with the prima facie approach endorsed by some of our past decisions , the district court here proceeded in four steps : it ( 1 ) considered the first three Graham factors ; ( 2 ) made a legal prima facie determination of obviousness ; ( 3 ) considered objective indicia of nonobviousness ; and ( 4 ) made an ultimate conclusion of obviousness . Steps one and three are factual , whereas steps two and four are legal . It is clear to me that courts are making a legal determination of obviousness at step two . As a result , all of the facts concerning patentability are not considered . This is error . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I read Supreme Court and Federal Circuit precedent to require all factual analysis to occur prior to achieving a legal conclusion on non-obviousness . This should be done without resort to an intermediate *1358 prima facie conclusion . See , e.g. , Graham , 383 U.S. at 36 , 86 S.Ct . 684 ( not making a prima facie conclusion and instead reserving any legal conclusion until after discussion of all factual predicates ) ; KSR , 550 U.S. at 426 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 ( same ) ; Apple , 839 F.3d at 1058 ( same ) ; Cyclobenzaprine , 676 F.3d at 1081-83 ( same ) ; Stratoflex , 713 F.2d at 1539 ( same ) . Thus , I would instruct the district court to abandon the prima facie framework and instead proceed in two steps : ( 1 ) consider all factual evidence , both favoring and disfavoring a finding of obviousness ; and ( 2 ) make a legal conclusion of obviousness . Accord Wm . Wrigley Jr. Co. , 683 F.3d at 1370 ( Newman , J. , dissenting ) ; Robert A. Matthews , Jr. , Annotated Patent Digest ¡± 18:93 ( `` A court should consider evidence of secondary considerations together with the evidence alleged to create a prima facie case of obviousness before determining whether an invention is or is not obvious . In other words , secondary considerations do not come into play only to rebut a prima facie case of obvious , ( even though that is often how they are considered during prosecution ) . Rather , the considerations factor in to the initial determination of obviousness. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I recognize there are practical limitations of legal analysis and writing . A court 's opinion must be linear and cover only one issue at a time . Typically , discussion of the objective indicia of non-obviousness comes last in an obviousness analysis . There is nothing inherently wrong with this order per se . Again , Supreme Court precedent is instructive . The Court discussed objective indicia of non-obviousness last in Graham . 383 U.S. at 35-36 , 86 S.Ct . 684 . So too in KSR . 550 U.S. at 426 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 . But in both cases , the Court made no `` prima facie '' finding of obviousness , did not relegate objective indicia into an afterthought , and reserved its legal conclusion for after discussion of all relevant factual inquiries . Id . Our seminal Federal Circuit decisions have done the same . See Apple , 839 F.3d at 1058 ; Cyclobenzaprine , 676 F.3d at 1081-83 ; Stratoflex , 713 F.2d at 1539 . But the notion that objective criteria are considered after a legal prima facie showing is made has taken root like a spreading vine . This gives rise to cases , such as this case on appeal , where a court determines that a particularly `` strong '' prima facie showing has been made , making it difficult if not impossible for adequate weighing of evidence of objective indicia of non-obviousness . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This case presents a textbook example of why courts should not make any determinations of obviousness , prima facie or otherwise , prior to considering objective indicia of non-obviousness . Here , Kellogg responded to Kraft 's patent infringement suit by alleging that Kraft 's patent was invalid for obviousness . Kellogg presented evidence of prior art that it alleged a person of ordinary skill would have been motivated to combine . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In response to Kellogg 's evidence of obviousness , Kraft presented at least three objective indicia of nonobviousness . The district court wrote that Kraft `` has offered substantial evidence from which a jury could find that its invention has been commercially successful . '' J.A . 29 . Kraft presented evidence that its sales volume increased four percent due to the invention . J.A . 28 . It also presented `` evidence of positive consumer feedback '' and survey results showing that the invention `` was a clear favorite for nearly all '' survey respondents . J.A . 29 . The court also found that Kraft introduced evidence of long-felt but unsolved need . Id . It explained that Kraft won `` one of the highest industry awards innovative packaging technology can receive '' and pointed to `` many industry publications '' praising the technology . Id . Finally , Kraft presented evidence `` show [ ing ] that Kellogg intentionally copied *1359 [ Kraft 's ] packaging . '' Id . The court found this evidence of copying to be `` compelling . '' Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I am left to wonder how `` substantial '' and `` compelling '' evidence of objective indicia can not overcome a prima facie showing . If such significant evidence does not make a difference in this case , it is hard to imagine a situation in which it would . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ An observer noted that `` the law , with respect to the importance of secondary considerations or objective indicia , is going through a transformation . '' J. Jeffrey Hawley , The Resurgence of `` Secondary Considerations '' , 16 FLA. COASTAL L. REV . 1 , 23 ( 2014 ) . I hope so . Cyclobenzaprine was a step in the right direction . We should finish what Cyclobenzaprine started and prohibit prima facie findings of obviousness prior to consideration of objective indicia of non-obviousness . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ II . _NEWLINE_ Because it affirms on obviousness grounds , the majority does not discuss the district court 's grant of summary judgment of no literal infringement . Because I would reverse the obviousness determination , I would review the infringement finding . I would find reversible error in the district court 's claim construction , which led to its finding of no literal infringement . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Kraft sued Kellogg for , inter alia , literal infringement of the '532 patent . Central to Kraft 's infringement allegation was the claim term `` sealing layer , '' which appears in claim 1 of the '532 patent . The parties disputed the construction of `` sealing layer '' in their claim construction briefs and at the claim construction hearing . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Following briefing and argument , the district court issued a Markman order construing `` sealing layer . '' The court concluded that the '532 patent claims require `` the sealing layer to be a distinct layer from the top of the container . '' J.A . 44 . The court went on : _NEWLINE_ This does not mean , however , that the sealing layer must be physically separated from the top of the container or , more specifically , from the wrapper that forms the top of the container as described in claim 1 . In particular , the requirement of a distinct layer does not preclude the sealing layer from being laminated to another layer or layers of the wrapper . One layer of material that is laminated to another is no less a distinct layer . In other words , `` distinct '' and `` separate '' have different meanings in this context . _NEWLINE_ J.A . 45 ( emphases added ) . Neither party disputes that this construction , as expressed in the Markman order , is correct . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In its subsequent summary judgment order , however , the court construed `` sealing layer '' differently . The summary judgment order stated that the sealing layer `` must be a separate piece of material . '' J.A . 32 . This construction was outcome-determinative : The court noted that it granted summary judgment of no literal infringement `` based on [ its ] construction of the claim term , 'sealing layer .

This distinction is critical because if the sealing layer need not be separate from the top of the container , then a reasonable jury could conclude that Kellogg literally infringed the '532 patent . The majority opinion fails to address this issue at all , either in its recitation of the facts or its analysis of the law .

Because Kraft did not have an opportunity to respond to the midstream change in the meaning of `` sealing layer , '' I would reverse the grant of summary judgment of no literal infringement . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I respectfully dissent from judgment of the majority to : ( 1 ) affirm the district court 's grant of summary judgment of obviousness and ( 2 ) not address the court 's claim construction error . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 869 F.3d 1336 , 124 U.S.P.Q.2d 1081 _NEWLINE_ Footnotes _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Kellogg also sought summary judgment of non-infringement , but the district court agreed only as to literal infringement , concluding that the record presented a triable issue as to infringement by equivalence .

Bentley Laboratories , Inc. , 601 F.Supp . 964 , 225 USPQ 1013 ( C.D.Cal.1985 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Bentley appeals from the trial court 's entry of judgment on the jury verdict and charges the district court with abuse of discretion in calculating the damage award based on the issuance date of the '264 patent , in doubling the damage award based on the finding of willful infringement , and in denying Bentley 's motion for new trial based on prejudicial error . We affirm . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Background _NEWLINE_ The patents in suit relate to a high efficiency heat exchanger designed for use with a blood oxygenator ( the `` lung '' portion of the heart-lung machine employed during open heart surgery ) . The heat exchanger is used to lower the temperature of the blood prior to and during surgery , and then to rewarm the blood to normal temperature . The cooled blood induces a condition called hypothermia , characterized by slowed functioning of the vital organs and overall reduced oxygen consumption by the patient . Hypothermia gives the surgeon time to perform a surgical procedure and enhances the patient 's likelihood of survival . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The heat exchanger of this invention can be formed from tubing which has a hollow , helical ( spiral ) rib along its length . The tubing is wrapped around a cylinder and then encased in a tight-fitting shell . Heated or cooled water flows through the inside of the tubing , while the blood flows along the outside . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1565 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ? _NEWLINE_ *1566 The combination of the rib and the surfaces of the cylinder and shell confines blood flow to a number of small , long paths . Temperature control is very efficient , due in part to the large heat exchange surface contacted by a relatively small volume of blood . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The helically ribbed tubing , known by the trade name Turbotec , is made of metal . The Shiley patent specifications referred to U.S. Patent Nos . RE24 , 783 and 3,015,355 for methods and apparatus for manufacture of such tubing . Both aluminum and stainless steel are mentioned in the Shiley patents as possible materials for construction of the tubing . Stainless steel is compatible with a blood environment but is expensive and has poor heat conductivity . Aluminum is toxic to human blood but has good heat conductivity and is relatively inexpensive . The Shiley patents disclosed that the toxic properties of aluminum may be overcome by application of a thin coating of polyurethane . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ An alternative form of the tubing may have a series of individual ring-like ribs . The claims that refer to this type of tubing are 7 , 8 , 19 and 24 of the '288 patent , and are referred to as the bellows claims . The district court held that these claims were not in suit because no evidence was presented that defendant was making an oxygenator according to these claims . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The heat exchanger may be mounted within a blood chamber separate from the blood oxygenator , or incorporated within the oxygenator . The preferred embodiment of both Shiley patents , the Shiley product ( S-100 ) and Bentley 's accused device ( BOS-10 ) all have the heat exchanger located within the mixing chamber of a bubble blood oxygenator . A bubble blood oxygenator uses a device such as a sparge tube to introduce fine bubbles of oxygen and other gases into the blood . What actually travels through the heat exchanger is blood foam , not ordinary blood , and a subsequent defoaming step is required . During prosecution of the Shiley patents , the applicant demonstrated to the satisfaction of the examiner that the placement of this particular heat exchanger within the mixing tank of a bubble oxygenator results in enhanced blood-gas transfer . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Issues _NEWLINE_ The issues before this court are whether the district court erred in denying defendant 's motion for JNOV , and denying defendant 's motion for new trial , as well as issues relating to damages . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Judgment Non Obstante Veredicto ( JNOV ) _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Inequitable Conduct _NEWLINE_ Bentley argues that it is entitled to JNOV because the jury finding that Shiley made no misrepresentation or omission in dealing with the PTO is clearly erroneous , not supported by substantial evidence , and contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence . This argument is based on the ground of nondisclosure to the PTO of : ( 1 ) advertisements for the Turbotec tubing used in the Shiley patent , and ( 2 ) a drawing of a bubble blood oxygenator with a heat exchanger in the form of a helical coil as employed by Dr. Frank Gollan , a pioneer in the field of cardiac surgery . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Bentley argues that because the Turbotec ads contained a drawing of tubing that formed a helical coil , the jury finding of no omission was erroneous as a matter of law . The jury was presented evidence from the file wrapper that the patents for the Turbotec tubing were considered by the examiner and that the PTO viewed the Turbotec patents as disclosing a heat exchanger design identical to that claimed , but that the applicant had made a sound case for patentability based on unexpectedly efficient gas interchange resulting from the specific design of the device . We conclude that a reasonable jury could have found that no omission or misrepresentation occurred with respect to the Turbotec ads , and that the district court did not err in denying JNOV on this ground . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1567 Bentley 's argument with respect to the drawing is similarly without merit . The drawing was published by Dr. Frank Gollan in his book , Physiology of Cardiac Surgery ( 1959 ) . It is a schematic drawing applicable to several oxygenators designed and tested by Dr. Gollan which employed a heat exchanger in the form of a helical coil to simultaneously oxygenate and regulate the temperature of the blood . Bentley claims this information was never presented to the PTO . Dr. Gollan is well recognized in the field of blood hypothermia . His work has been described in other publications presented to the jury by Bentley : Dr. Pierre M. Galletti 's book , Heart-Lung Bypass ( 1962 ) ; and DeWall , et al. , `` Theme and Variations on Blood Oxygenators '' ( Surgery , December 1961 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Research on the use of hypothermia for surgical procedures has been conducted since the 1950 's . A number of different types of heat exchangers have been reported , and applicant , in both patent applications , cited `` Heart-Lung Bypass '' by Pierre M. Galletti , M.D . et al. , pp . 165-170 ( 1962 ) , for a comparison of different types of heat exchangers . The following text appears on page 167 : _NEWLINE_ Use has been made of this [ heat transfer by conduction ] with different geometrical configurations : coils , cylinders or plates . Each of these three types feature advantages and drawbacks . _NEWLINE_ 1 . A simple silver coil immersed in the pump oxygenator has served successfully for cooling and warming of the entire circulation of dogs by Gollan , et al . ( 1952 ) ( see fig . 21 . A ) . Peirce and Polley ( 1953 , 1956 ) , Dietman ( 1955 ) and Oselladore , et al . 1957 found the same type of heat exchanger reliable . For autogenous lung oxygenation , Shields and Lewis ( 1959 ) inserted a stainless steel coil in both right heart bypass and left heart bypass circuits . A double lumen coil , with the blood circulating inside and the water outside , was proposed by Ross ( 1954 a ) . Zuhdi , et al . ( 1960 b . 1961 ) astutely thought of a long stainless steel spiral wound in the helix settling chamber of the DeWall-Lilleher bubble oxygenator ( fig . 59 C ) . * * * . [ Emphasis added . ] _NEWLINE_ The citation to figure `` 21 . A '' refers to page 70 of that same text , and to a drawing of the Gollan oxygenator . Applicant did not cite directly to page 70 of `` Heart-Lung Bypass , '' an omission that is the substantive basis for Bentley 's contention that Shiley engaged in inequitable conduct before the PTO . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The jury was presented considerable evidence on the issue of whether an omission had been made . It heard evidence that the Gollan oxygenators were used in pioneer work on open heart surgery in animals . It heard further evidence that the PTO had reviewed more current prior art , including Patent No . 3,437,450 to Greenwood , which Bentley admitted on appeal does disclose simultaneous temperature control and oxygenation of the blood . The jury watched a film of a Gollan oxygenator in operation , showing how it operates differently from the invention claimed in the patent in suit , and that it has areas of stagnation , a potentially deadly flaw . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The jury was presented voluminous evidence during trial before reaching its conclusion that no omission had been made . Substantial evidence supports the jury findings . Bentley 's argument , which selectively presents what favorable evidence may exist , does not warrant reversal of that fact finding . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Willfulness _NEWLINE_ Bentley argues that the district court should have granted Bentley 's JNOV motion on willful infringement because the undisputed facts establish that Bentley did not willfully infringe as a matter of law . In this case , the jury found willful infringement and the judge independently found willful infringement . See Shiley , Inc. v. Bentley Laboratories , Inc. , 601 F.Supp . 964 , 968 , 225 USPQ 1013 , 1016 ( C.D.Cal.1985 ) . The findings are in agreement and *1568 are amply supported by the record . The trial court exercised its discretion to award double damages based on its finding of willful infringement . We find no abuse of discretion in this award , see Kori Corp. v. Wilco Marsh Buggies and Draglines , Inc. , 761 F.2d 649 , 656-57 , 225 USPQ 985 , 989-90 ( Fed.Cir . ) , cert . denied , 474 U.S. 902 , 106 S.Ct . 230 , 88 L.Ed.2d 229 ( 1985 ) , or in the award of attorney fees on this basis see Rosemount , Inc. v. Beckman Instruments , Inc. , 727 F.2d 1540 , 1547-48 , 221 USPQ 1 , 8-9 ( Fed.Cir.1984 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The trial court apparently deemed it necessary to label as `` advisory '' one of the jury 's fact findings on willful infringement , and to make its own finding of fact , to enable it to exercise the court 's statutory discretion to award increased damages . 35 U.S.C . ¡± 284 . * That step was neither appropriate nor necessary . All fact findings of a jury are non-advisory , unless made in an area expressly removed from jury verdict . The first sentence of ¡± 284 deals with actual damages , which , if not found by the jury , must be found by the court . The second sentence deals with increasing damages , which is assigned to the court , whether the facts of willful infringement justifying an increase are found by a jury , or by a court in a non-jury trial . Thus , if a jury finding of willful infringement is not overturned on a motion for JNOV , the court has discretion to award increased damages on the basis of the jury 's finding ; if the jury finding is that willful infringement did not occur and that finding is not overturned on a motion for JNOV , no basis for assessing increased damages for willful infringement exists ; if the jury finding is that willful infringement did not occur , and the court does overturn that finding on a motion for JNOV because no reasonable jury could on all the facts find an absence of willful infringement , the court may increase damages within its discretion under ¡± 284 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Bentley argues that since it began to market its infringing device a month before any of Shiley 's patents issued , its infringement can not be willful as a matter of law under State Industries , Inc. v. A.O . Smith Corp. , 751 F.2d 1226 , 224 USPQ 418 ( Fed.Cir.1985 ) . We disagree . State does not , as Bentley contends , hold that a finding of willful infringement can not stand whenever manufacture of an accused device begins prior to the issuance of a patent . On the contrary , State is in harmony with our prior and subsequent case law , which looks to the `` totality of the circumstances presented in the case , '' Central Soya Co. v. George A. Hormel & Co. , 723 F.2d 1573 , 220 USPQ 490 ( Fed.Cir.1983 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Obviousness/Manner of Making Invention _NEWLINE_ Bentley argues that the district court should have granted Bentley 's JNOV motion because the inventions of the Shiley patents would have been obvious as a matter of law . It argues that John Lewin , the inventor , was a mechanical engineer who had no work experience with blood or blood oxygenators , and that he necessarily had less than ordinary skill in the art ; that he saw a Turbotec tubing ad and immediately conceived the successful design to obtain a known result . Extensive evidence on these and related factual issues pertinent to obviousness was presented to the jury , who were correctly instructed that patentability of an invention does not depend on how the invention was made . 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 . We see no reversible error in the district court 's refusal to grant JNOV on the basis of Bentley 's argument . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Motion for New Trial _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Denial of Declaratory Judgment Counterclaim _NEWLINE_ Bentley argues on appeal that its motion for new trial should have been granted *1569 because the district court refused to try its declaratory judgment counterclaim with respect to claims 6 , 7 , 19 , and 24 ( bellows claims ) of the '288 patent . Bentley asserts ( 1 ) it presented evidence to the trial court that a bellows oxygenator was being made by Bentley at that time ; ( 2 ) it was prepared to prove that Shiley had engaged in inequitable conduct in its dealings with the PTO by concealing an on-sale bar with respect to these claims ; and ( 3 ) the district court refused to admit evidence with respect to the allegedly inequitable conduct . These assertions are not supported by the record . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ One month prior to trial , Bentley 's counsel sought declaratory judgment of non-infringement with respect to the bellows claims . Shiley objected because Bentley had successfully prevented discovery with respect to its experimental bellows oxygenators by raising the attorney/client privilege . The trial court attempted to determine what effect denial of the counterclaim would have on Bentley 's rights . In response to the trial court 's statement that it did not know how the doctrine of res judicata applied in patent cases ( i.e. , whether a defendant could later proceed against unadjudicated claims of a patent ) and an invitation to counsel to comment , counsel for Bentley stated : _NEWLINE_ MR. LYON : There is one problem that worries me , your Honor . _NEWLINE_ That is , if after this trial , we decided to make a bellows-type device , will we be precluded from asserting invalidity of those claims in view of the proceedings today ? _NEWLINE_ If your ruling is such that that might be preserved to us , then we have no objection to your Honor so ruling . _NEWLINE_ Contrary to Bentley 's appellate brief , Bentley presented no evidence to the trial court that the bellows oxygenator was being made . Instead , Bentley stated only that they might be made in the future , and did not object to the court 's ruling . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Bentley 's second assertion that it was prepared to prove that Shiley engaged in inequitable conduct in its dealings with the PTO by concealing an on-sale bar with respect to the bellows claims , is not supported by evidence . The evidence consists of two documents written by Bentley 's counsel , and a proposed issue of fact for the jury . One document is defendant 's exhibit 298 , a copy of a memorandum to file containing a statement that `` discovery has established that the S-100 was on sale , in public use and illustrated in printed publications more than a year prior to that date , '' without elaboration . The other document is defendant 's exhibit 297 , a letter which contains no mention of the on-sale bar . The proposed jury question , of course , is not evidence . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Even if these documents could have raised the issue of an on-sale bar , Bentley is unable to argue prejudice from the district court 's refusal to admit them , because these exhibits were offered and accepted into evidence . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Bentley also argues that the district court 's denial of the declaratory judgment counterclaim allowed Shiley to narrow the scope of the adjudicated claims during trial , thereby precluding Bentley from asserting certain prior art against the claims in issue . Bentley 's argument with respect to its allegedly invalidating prior art falls because the prior art was offered and accepted into evidence at trial . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Jury Interrogatories/Inequitable Conduct _NEWLINE_ Bentley argues that Shiley engaged in inequitable conduct by concealing material prior art from the PTO during prosecution of its patents , and that it is entitled to a new trial because the jury made no findings of materiality and intent .

This approach is not error . See Weinar v. Rollform , Inc. , 744 F.2d 797 , 223 USPQ 369 ( Fed.Cir.1984 ) , cert . denied , 470 U.S. 1084 , 105 S.Ct . 1844 , 85 L.Ed.2d 143 ( 1985 ) . Had the jury found that a misrepresentation or omission had been made , then questions of materiality and intent would arise . Since the jury answered no to interrogatory 9 ( a ) , supra , and this finding was supported by substantial evidence , no further inquiry was necessary . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Inflammatory Statement _NEWLINE_ Bentley argues that its motion for new trial should have been granted because the district court committed prejudicial error by allowing Shiley 's counsel to cross examine Mr. Bentley and elicit an admission that his company had been adjudged a willful infringer in prior litigation with a third party . As Shiley points out , Bentley neglects to mention that it laid the groundwork for Shiley 's questions during its own direct examination . Mr. Bentley testified on direct examination that Bentley had not copied the Shiley S-100 , that he had not seen the S-100 prior to the production of the BOS-10 , that he was President , Chief Executive Officer , and Chairman of the Board of Bentley , and that he was intimately involved in the development of Bentley devices . He also testified as to his integrity and personal involvement in avoiding `` conflict '' with other patents . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Bentley had made a pre-trial admission that it had possession of four models of the S-100 prior to the development of the BOS-10 . Mr. Bentley 's credibility was squarely placed in issue by his direct testimony . He stated on cross-examination that he personally maintained a policy of avoiding infringement of other firms ' patents . The district court , over timely objection , permitted Shiley to impeach the witness using a detailed recitation of Mr. Bentley 's activities as recorded in the opinion in Deknatel , Inc. v. Bentley Sales , Inc. , 173 USPQ 129 ( C.D.Calif.1971 ) . We find no error in the judge 's ruling under these circumstances . Fed.R.Evid . 608 and 611 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Jury Instruction/Damages _NEWLINE_ Bentley argues it is entitled to a new trial because the district court 's instruction *1571 on damages , over objection , asked the jury to assess damages from December 27 , 1977 , the issue date of the '264 product patent . Bentley claims that Shiley did not prove marking of the S-100 with notice of the '264 patent , and pursuant to 35 U.S.C . ¡± 287 , Shiley may only rely upon February 6 , 1979 , the issue date of the '288 method patent , as the commencement date for any damages . An examination of the record reveals that the objection Bentley made was to `` all parts of the verdict form '' [ emphasis ours ] . This objection does not conform to the requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P . 51 and is insufficient to preserve this type of error on appeal . Further , it appears from the record that marking of the S-100 was not in issue at trial . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We have considered Bentley 's arguments with regard to prejudgment interest and find them without merit . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We have carefully considered Bentley 's other arguments and citations to precedent and the record .

Terlep ( `` Terlep '' ) appeals from the decision of the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas ( `` district court '' ) granting the motion of The Brinkmann Corp. , Wal-Mart Stores , Inc. , and Home Depot , U.S.A. , Inc. ( collectively , `` Brinkmann '' ) for summary judgment of non-infringement of U.S. Patent No . 5,594,433 ( `` the '433 patent '' ) . Terlep v. Brinkmann Corp. , No . 02-CV-5127 ( W.D.Ark . March 29 , 2004 ) ( `` Order I '' ) . Because the district court correctly construed the claim term `` clear '' and properly granted Brinkmann 's motion for summary judgment of non-infringement , we affirm . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I . BACKGROUND _NEWLINE_ The '433 patent relates to omni-directional light emitting diode ( `` LED '' ) lamps . LEDs are a desirable substitute for traditional incandescent lamps because of their increased lifetime , higher resistance to shock and vibration , and lower cost of production . However , in contrast to an incandescent lamp , which emits light omni-directionally , the light from an LED is emitted in a forward cone of less than 90 degrees . The '433 patent is directed to the production of omni-directional light by reflecting the cone of light from an LED off a semi-spherical convex reflector . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Independent claim 1 recites , with the terms at issue underlined : _NEWLINE_ 1 . An omni-directional LED lamp useful for traffic control and warning devices that reflects light in a 360 degree circumferential direction without having to rotate any components , comprising : _NEWLINE_ a first LED ; _NEWLINE_ a first semi-spherical reflector having a continuous convex reflective surface , the first semi-spherical reflector mounted above the first LED , wherein light from the first LED is reflected substantially in a 360 degree circumference rendering the first LED omni-directional ; and _NEWLINE_ *1381 a first clear plastic tubular holder for tightly holding the first semi-spherical reflector oriented directly above the first LED in a stationary non rotating position , wherein the first semi-spherical reflector reflects light in a 360 degree circumferential direction . _NEWLINE_ '433 patent , col. 6 , ll . 13-28 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Claim 4 depends from claim 1 and recites that the `` first semi-spherical reflector includes : a mirror finish deposited on a plastic shape . '' Id . at col. 6 , ll . 57-59 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On November 28 , 1997 , Terlep filed suit against Brinkmann , alleging that Brinkmann 's products infringed claims 1 and 4 of the '433 patent literally and under the doctrine of equivalents . The accused products are solar-powered lamps for pathway lighting . The lamps were sold through retailers Wal-Mart and Home Depot . These lamps use an LED and a convex reflector that is less than a full half sphere . Further , because they are used for pathway lighting , the relative orientation between the reflector and the LED when the product is in use is such that the reflector is located below the LED . Finally , the Brinkmann lights use a ribbed holder to align and position the reflector in front of the LED . Brinkmann denied infringement and filed a counterclaim alleging invalidity . The district court construed a number of disputed terms and , based on the claim construction , granted Brinkmann 's motion for summary judgment of non-infringement and dismissed the claims with prejudice . Order I . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On April 14 , 2004 , Terlep filed a notice of appeal . Because the district court 's initial order did not address Brinkmann 's invalidity counterclaim , this court determined that it lacked jurisdiction and dismissed the appeal . Terlep v. Brinkmann Corp. , 127 Fed.Appx . 498 ( Fed.Cir.2005 ) . Thereafter , following a stipulation by the parties , the district court dismissed Brinkmann 's counterclaim without prejudice , leaving no issues unresolved . Terlep v. Brinkmann Corp. , No . 02-CV-5127 ( W.D.Ark . March 24 , 2005 ) ( `` Order II '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On March 10 , 2005 , Terlep filed a new notice of appeal and a motion to reinstate . In an Order entered April 11 , 2005 , this court recalled the mandate and reinstated the appeal . The appeal is now properly before us , and we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C . ¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ II . ANALYSIS _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A . Standard of Review _NEWLINE_ `` We review a district court 's grant of summary judgment de novo . '' See Ethicon Endo-Surgery , Inc. v. United States Surgical Corp. , 149 F.3d 1309 , 1315 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) . Summary judgment is appropriate only when there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law . See Fed.R.Civ.P . 56 ( c ) . `` In determining whether there is a genuine issue of material fact , the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion , with doubts resolved in favor of the opponent . '' Chiuminatta Concrete Concepts , Inc. v. Cardinal Indus. , Inc. , 145 F.3d 1303 , 1307 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) . If there are no material facts in dispute precluding summary judgment , `` our task is to determine whether the judgment granted is correct as a matter of law . '' Marathon Oil Co. v. United States , 177 F.3d 1331 , 1337 ( Fed.Cir.1999 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A determination of infringement requires a two-step analysis . `` First , the claim must be properly construed to determine its scope and meaning . Second , the claim as properly construed must be compared to the accused device or process . '' Carroll Touch , Inc. v. Electro Mech . Sys. , Inc. , 15 F.3d 1573 , 1576 ( Fed.Cir.1993 ) .

L & L Wings , Inc. , 160 F.3d 1350 , 1353 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B . Discussion _NEWLINE_ Terlep argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment by concluding that the preamble of claim 1 of the '433 patent was a limitation , and that Brinkmann did not meet the `` above '' and `` clear '' limitations of claim 1 . Brinkman responds that the district court correctly construed these limitations and , further , that the district court 's judgment should be affirmed on the additional grounds that the limitations `` semi-spherical , '' `` directly , '' `` plastic , '' and `` tubular '' have not been met . Because we conclude that the district court correctly construed the `` clear '' limitation of claim 1 , and because summary judgment of non-infringement was proper on that basis , we do not consider Terlep 's other arguments or Brinkman 's additional grounds for affirmance . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 . Claim Construction _NEWLINE_ `` The construction of claims is simply a way of elaborating the normally terse claim language in order to understand and explain , but not to change , the scope of the claims . '' Embrex , Inc. , v. Serv . Eng ' g Corp. , 216 F.3d 1343 , 1347 ( Fed.Cir.2000 ) ( internal quotations and citation omitted ) . Interpreting the asserted claims entails a review of the intrinsic evidence , which consists of the claim language , the written description , and the prosecution history . See id . ; Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic , Inc. , 90 F.3d 1576 , 1582 ( Fed.Cir.1996 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ `` [ T ] he specification is always highly relevant to the claim construction analysis . Usually , it is dispositive ; it is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term . '' Phillips v. AWH Corp. , 415 F.3d 1303 , 1314 ( Fed.Cir.2005 ) ( en banc ) ( internal quotations omitted ) . `` [ T ] he prosecution history can often inform the meaning of the claim language by demonstrating how the inventor understood the invention and whether the inventor limited the invention in the course of prosecution , making the claim scope narrower than it would otherwise be . '' Id . at 1317 . Extrinsic evidence such as dictionaries also `` may be considered if the court deems it helpful in determining the true meaning of the language used in the patent claims , '' id . at 1318 ( internal quotations omitted ) , provided the court `` attach [ es ] the appropriate weight ... to those sources in light of the statutes and policies that inform patent law , '' id . at 1324 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court construed the term `` clear '' of independent claim 1 to mean `` transparent '' or `` having the property of transmitting light without appreciable scattering so that bodies lying beyond are seen clearly . '' Order I at 7 . Terlep challenges the district court 's interpretation arguing that the term should be construed to also cover translucent holders . Terlep contends that the intrinsic record requires only that the word `` clear '' be construed to permit the passage of light . Brinkmann responds that the district court 's construction is correctly informed by the written description , which states that the purpose of the holder is to maximize light output , and that any other interpretation would be inconsistent with the '433 patent . Brinkmann adds that the `` translucent '' argument was not made to the district court and , thus , was waived . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1383 Claim 1 recites an omni-directional LED lamp that has three elements : an LED ; a semi-spherical reflector ; and a clear plastic tubular holder . The claim sets forth the positional relation between these elements such that the light emitted from the LED is rendered omni-directional after reflecting off the semi-spherical reflector . See '433 patent , col. 6 , ll . 26-27 . The reflected light passes through the holder , which holds the semi-spherical reflector . See id . at ll . 24-28 . The text of claim 1 and the other claims provide little guidance on the meaning of the term `` clear . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The written description discloses a preferred embodiment in which the LED is surrounded by `` tubular canopies '' or holders that are made of `` clear and pliable plastic material . '' Id . at col. 3 , ll . 58-59 . Another embodiment describes a colored lens cover that is made `` from clear colored plastic . '' Id . at col. 5 , l. 1 . While these passages are not particularly helpful in discerning the meaning of the term `` clear , '' other portions of the written description provide greater guidance . The Background and Prior Art sections state that various techniques for applying diffusion directly to the LED surfaces had been attempted in the past and were unsuccessful in rendering the light emitted from the LED omni-directional . Id . at col. 1 , ll . 37-45 . The Summary of the Invention section describes the invention as an omni-directional LED lamp that does not use a diffusion lens over the LEDs . Id . at col. 2 , ll . 5-7 . Implicit in these passages is the distinction between lenses or holders that diffuse or scatter light and those that transmit light without obstruction . The written description is thus consistent with and supports the district court 's construction of the term `` clear '' to refer to holders that are `` transparent or [ have ] the property of transmitting light without appreciable scattering so that bodies lying beyond are seen clearly . '' Order I at 7 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Terlep argues that the written description also is consistent with a `` translucent '' holder because it refers to an embodiment in which `` the lens cover ... can include a phosphorescent coating which glows when the LED ... is on so as to diffuse light evenly over a wide viewing angle and amplify visibility . '' See '433 patent , col. 5 , ll . 54-57 . However , the text quoted by Terlep relates to the embodiment of Figures 4A-4C , which does not include a `` clear plastic tubular holder '' as recited in claim 1 , at issue in this case . Because the `` lens cover '' described supra is not the same structure as the `` clear plastic tubular holder , '' compare id. , Figures 4A-4C & col. 5 , ll . 54-57 , with id. , Figure 2A & col. 3 , ll . 57-65 , Terlep 's argument is misplaced . Moreover , there is nothing in the description of the phosphorescent coating embodiment to warrant construction of the term `` clear '' as it relates to the `` clear plastic tubular holder '' of claim 1 to include translucent holders . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The prosecution history further supports the district court 's construction . On August 9 , 1995 , the application that issued as the '433 patent was filed . In a February 7 , 1996 Office Action , the Examiner , inter alia , rejected claim 1 under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 ( a ) as being unpatentable over U.S. Patent No . 5,469,157 to Carpenter et al . in view of U.S. Patent No . 1,198,734 to Ludescher . In a May 6 , 1996 Response ( `` Response '' ) , Terlep amended claim 1 to add , inter alia , `` a clear plastic tubular holder . '' Response at 1 . Terlep distinguished the claimed invention from the prior art stating that the prior art disclosed rotating LEDs and LEDs having a top `` flattened and ... side surface ( s ) ... sandblasted or otherwise roughened to diffuse the light output , '' whereas the `` subject invention did not use any 'flattened ' tops and/or 'sandblasted or roughened ' sides . '' Response at 5 . Because the `` clear plastic *1384 tubular holder '' limitation helped distinguish the prior art from the claimed invention , the prosecution history supports construing the term `` clear '' to exclude plastic holders that are translucent or otherwise diffuse the light emitted from the LED . See Seachange Int ' l , Inc. v. C-COR Inc. , 413 F.3d 1361 , 1372-73 ( Fed.Cir.2005 ) ( `` Where an applicant argues that a claim possesses a feature that the prior art does not possess in order to overcome a prior art rejection , the argument may serve to narrow the scope of otherwise broad claim language. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In construing the claims , the parties have cited several dictionaries . District courts are authorized `` to rely on extrinsic evidence , which consists of all evidence external to the patent and prosecution history , including ... dictionaries '' as one of many claim construction tools . Phillips , 415 F.3d at 1317 ( internal citations omitted ) . The dictionary defines `` clear '' as `` giving free passage to light or to the sight : easily seen through : not cloudy , turbid , or opaque . '' Webster 's Third Int ' l Dictionary 419 ( 1993 ) . This definition lists `` transparent '' and `` translucent '' as synonyms . The definition also sets forth an express distinction between transparent and translucent : `` transparent stresses complete absence of obstruction to vision '' and `` translucent applies to that which permits passage of light but bars clear and complete vision . '' Id . The distinction between these synonyms can not be ignored . See Int ' l Rectifier Corp. v. IXYS Corp. , 361 F.3d 1363 , 1374 ( 2004 ) ( holding that it was improper for the district court to adopt a definition that was attributed to a synonym of the disputed term while disregarding the distinction set forth in the usage note ) . Moreover , the distinction mirrors the distinction reflected in the written description and prosecution history between the unobstructed passage of light of the holder of the patented invention and the prior art structures that diffuse light . Here , the district court `` attached appropriate weight '' to the dictionary definitions in the context of the intrinsic evidence in reaching its construction of the claim term `` clear . '' Phillips , 415 F.3d at 1324 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Finally , Terlep argues that to define `` clear '' so as to exclude `` translucent '' is to import a functional limitation into the claim . Terlep asserts that `` clear plastic tubular holder '' is merely a structural limitation and that the district court erred in importing a functional limitation into a structural term . However , Terlep fails to recognize that the construction properly adopted by the district court merely assigned meaning to the claim term `` clear '' and did not impermissibly import a functional limitation . Merck & Co. v. Teva Pharms . USA , Inc. , 395 F.3d 1364 , 1372 ( Fed.Cir.2005 ) ( `` A claim construction that gives meaning to all the terms of the claim is preferred over one that does not do so. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We conclude that the district court correctly construed the term `` clear '' to mean `` transparent or having the property of transmitting light without appreciable scattering so that bodies lying beyond are seen clearly , '' and that nothing in the claims or the written description warranted giving the term `` clear '' an expansive meaning that would cover `` translucent '' holders . Because Terlep 's `` translucent '' argument is without merit , we need not consider Brinkmann 's additional argument of waiver . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 2 . Infringement _NEWLINE_ `` [ F ] or a court to find infringement , the plaintiff must show the presence of every element or its substantial equivalent in the accused device . '' Wolverine World Wide , Inc. v. Nike , Inc. , 38 F.3d 1192 , 1199 ( Fed.Cir.1994 ) ; see also Warner-Jenkinson *1385 Co. v. Hilton Davis Chem . Co. , 520 U.S. 17 , 40 , 117 S.Ct . 1040 , 137 L.Ed.2d 146 ( 1997 ) ( noting that because each limitation contained in a patent claim is material to defining the scope of the patented invention , a doctrine of equivalents analysis must be applied to individual claim limitations , not to the invention as a whole ) . `` Application of the rule precluding use of the doctrine of equivalents to recapture claim scope surrendered during patent acquisition is a question of law . '' KCJ Corp. v. Kinetic Concepts , Inc. , 223 F.3d 1351 , 1359 ( Fed.Cir.2000 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Claim 1 recites a `` clear plastic tubular holder . '' The district court concluded that there was no genuine issue of material fact that none of the accused products had a transparent holder . Order I at 10 . Terlep argues that some of the Brinkmann products have a clear plastic cover . However , Terlep does not dispute the fact that , although some of Brinkmann 's products have a transparent cover , none of them have a transparent holder . Terlep also does not contest that the Brinkmann products are ribbed and that the ribbed holders scatter the light shining from inside to prevent bodies inside the holder from being seen clearly . Id . Thus , Terlep has failed to provide any basis for us to conclude that the district court erred in determining that there was no genuine issue of material fact that the accused devices do not meet the `` clear plastic tubular holder '' limitation of claim 1 . Because claim 4 depends from claim 1 and also possesses this limitation , it too is not literally infringed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Terlep also challenges the district court 's grant of summary judgment of non-infringement under the doctrine of equivalents . Specifically , Terlep argues that the district court erred in foreclosing its assertion of the doctrine of equivalents by reason of prosecution history estoppel . It asserts this argument despite its acknowledgement that the `` clear plastic tubular holder '' limitation was added during prosecution to help overcome the prior art . Terlep claims that this amendment does not bar it from asserting equivalents under the doctrine announced in Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co. , Ltd. , 535 U.S. 722 , 733 , 122 S.Ct . 1831 , 152 L.Ed.2d 944 ( 2002 ) . Under Festo , a narrowing amendment made to satisfy a requirement of the Patent Act may give rise to an estoppel . Id . at 736 , 122 S.Ct . 1831 . Such a narrowing amendment creates a presumption that the patentee surrendered the territory between the original claims and the amended claims . Id . at 741 , 122 S.Ct . 1831 . The patentee may rebut that presumption by showing that the alleged equivalent was unforeseeable at the time the amendment was made , that the alleged equivalent was tangential to the purpose of that amendment , or that there was some other reason suggesting that the patentee could not reasonably be expected to have described the insubstantial substitute in question . Id . at 740-41 , 122 S.Ct . 1831 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Terlep argues that its amendment of claim 1 to include the limitation `` clear plastic tubular holder '' does not estop it from asserting infringement under the doctrine of equivalents because the equivalent in question was tangential to the purpose of the amendment . The primary consideration in determining when an amendment bears only a tangential relation to the equivalent in question is `` whether the reason for the amendment is peripheral , or not directly relevant , to the alleged equivalent . '' Insituform Techs. , Inc. v. CAT Constr. , Inc. , 385 F.3d 1360 , 1370 ( Fed.Cir.2004 ) ( citing Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co. , Ltd. , 344 F.3d 1359 , 1365 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) ( en banc ) ) . Terlep asserts that the prosecution *1386 history shows that the addition of the term `` clear '' was merely to describe the plastic used for the claimed `` plastic holder , '' and thus the addition of that term is not directly relevant to the accused equivalent . However , as discussed supra , Terlep amended claim 1 and argued patentability based on the diffusion characteristics of prior art LED devices and the absence of diffusion in the clear plastic tubular holder of the claimed invention . Thus , it can not be said that the reason for adding `` clear '' was tangential to the accused equivalents , which are holders that are ribbed and diffuse light . See Festo , 344 F.3d at 1369 ( noting that `` the inquiry into whether a patentee can rebut the Festo presumption under the 'tangantial ' criterion focuses on the patentee 's objectively apparent reason for the narrowing amendment '' ) . Thus , Terlep has failed to rebut the Festo presumption , and we affirm the district court 's grant of summary judgment of non-infringement under the doctrine of equivalents as a matter of law . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ III . CONCLUSION _NEWLINE_ For the foregoing reasons , we affirm the district court 's construction of the term `` clear . '' We also affirm the district court 's grant of Brinkmann 's motion of summary judgment of non-infringement . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ AFFIRMED _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 418 F.3d 1379 , 76 U.S.P.Q.2d 1053

We reverse and remand . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Background _NEWLINE_ In January 1979 , Amstar Corporation ( Amstar ) sued Envirotech Corporation ( Envirotech ) and Energy Fuels Nuclear , Inc. ( EFN ) , charging infringement of process and apparatus claims 1 through 10 of the '889 patent , active inducement of others to infringe , and contributory infringement . Envirotech and EFN asserted defenses of non-infringement , invalidity under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 , and unenforceability for failure to disclose certain prior art to the Patent and Trademark Office ( PTO ) , and counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment of invalidity , non-infringement , and unenforceability . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The action was tried to the court from June 22 through June 30 , 1981 . The trial transcript ran over 1,150 pages . Some 300 exhibits totaled over 4,000 pages of technical diagrams , photos , and articles . In-court and videotaped experiments were demonstrated , and the court conducted an on-site inspection of a laboratory version of Envirotech equipment . After submission of counsels ' supplemental memoranda , the court issued a Memorandum Decision and judgment on May 3 , 1983 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Validity _NEWLINE_ In its 66-page Memorandum Decision , the district court devoted 59 pages to a thorough discussion of the facts and law governing the validity issue . Though the court confessed to a felt inadequacy respecting the involved technology , much of its discussion thereof was flawless . Finding that the inventions claimed in the '889 patent ( Eis inventions ) clearly survived certain nonstatutory ( and thus erroneous ) tests , the court held the patent valid and enforceable.1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The subject matter of the inventions in suit and the real-world milieu surrounding their nature , their birth and growth , and the reaction of experts to these inventions , and the reactions of the industry and of Envirotech , were set forth in the court 's Memorandum Decision . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The court generally described the subject matter of the '889 patent : _NEWLINE_ [ A ] process and apparatus designed to enable industrial enterprises to separate solids from a large volume of liquid over a relatively short period of time . Far from letting muddy waters settle in their own good time , [ the '889 patent discloses ] a continuous flow process that takes advantage of the efficacy of chemical flocculating agents in separating solids-especially finely-divided solids-out of a liquid suspension or emulsion , enhanced further by the design of the apparatus and by the specific steps taken in the process . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Citing 29 internal memoranda in evidence as illustrating the skepticism of Envirotech 's engineers ( `` re-written the laws of gravity '' ; `` a new concept ... verdict ... undecided '' ) , and the `` great effort '' of Envirotech 's engineers , technicians , and specialists to gather and analyze data in an attempt `` to discern the mechanism by which the Enviro-clear2 clarifier/thickener operates '' , the district court stated : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Having expended such great efforts to discover if and how the Enviro-Clear method works , it is ironic at least to some extent for Envirotech to now assert that the Eis process was obvious to those *1479 skilled in the art . Perhaps , like a brilliant move in a game of chess , it seems so obvious and simple-after you have once seen it played.3 _NEWLINE_ The district court : carefully made the findings required by Graham v. John Deere Co. , 383 U.S. 1 , 86 S.Ct . 684 , 15 L.Ed.2d 545 , 148 USPQ 459 ( 1966 ) ; avoided the hindsight approach on which it said Envirotech depended ; rejected the improper each-element-is-old approach ; found that the Eis inventions passed the erroneously `` required '' tests of `` synergism '' or `` unexpected results '' ; found that the Eis inventions filled a long felt need unmet by others who tried and failed , caused abandonment of long standing traditional testing methods for this type of equipment , achieved commercial success and trade acceptance , and ran contrary to the teachings of the prior art as synthesized in Envirotech 's Manual just before Eis made his inventions ; found that Eis proceeded `` afoul of the rule '' taught by the prior art against introduction of feed into the settling zone ; found ( without designating ) that some of the non-PTO considered prior art was cumulative and some was not ; and reached the conclusion that the Eis inventions would not have been obvious `` based upon a preponderance of all the evidence as independently weighed and considered by this court '' .4 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Claims _NEWLINE_ Though claims 1-10 were asserted , the appeal can be determined on consideration of independent claims 1 , 8 , and 9 : _NEWLINE_ 1 . A continuous process for rapidly separating finely divided suspended solid materials from liquids at a predetermined controlled rate , comprising the steps of forming a slurry of solid agglomerates in an influent feed of liquid containing finely divided and suspended solids by the addition of a settling aid , forming a settling zone having a relatively stationary upper boundary and containing previously formed solid agglomerates , introducing said influent liquid slurry at a central position within said settling zone and centrally of said previously formed solid agglomerates , arresting the motion of the influent feed and displacing the same outwardly through said previously formed agglomerates to cause additional agglomeration of the solids and the formation without additional agitation of a dense settleable mass of the solids and agglomerates , continuously removing a dense underflow from beneath said settling zone at a rate to maintain said relatively stationary upper boundary , and continuously removing an overflow of clarified liquid from above said upper boundary of said settling zone , whereby separation of the solids and liquids rapidly occurs in said settling zone . _NEWLINE_ 8 . A continuous process for treating liquids to remove substances therefrom in the form of solid particles and agglomerated solid particles , which comprises forming and maintaining a settling zone *1480 of concentrated slurry containing suspended solid particles and agglomerated solid particles of like nature to those to be formed and sep [ sic ] separated , mixing solids-containing liquid to be processed with a settling and agglomerating agent , said mixing producing a liquid slurry containing freshly agglomerating solids , introducing said liquid slurry as an influent feed at a central position within said settling zone , arresting the motion of said influent feed and displacing the same outwardly through the concentrated slurry in said settling zone to effect additional agglomerations of the solid particles , whereby relatively large agglomerates of solid particles are formed which settle rapidly without additional agitation to form a dense underflow of agglomerates and entrained solid particles , the point of arresting said influent feed being close to said central point of introduction of the influent feed , controlling the depth of said settling zone by withdrawal of said dense underflow so that said settling zone of concentrated slurry is provided with a relatively stationary upper boundary , the rate of withdrawal of said dense underflow being such that said upper boundary of the settling zone is above the point of arresting the motion of the influent feed , and withdrawing clarified liquid from above said settling zone of concentrated slurry . _NEWLINE_ 9 . In an apparatus for rapidly and continuously separating finely divided and suspended solid materials from liquids at a predetermined and controlled rate , a settling vessel having top on bottom outlet means , inlet means including conduit means extending to a centralized position within said settling vessel , means for introducing a substantally [ sic ] vertical flow of influent feed of liquid containing freshly agglomerating solid materials to said centralized point of entry established by said conduit means , unitary substantially horizontal baffle means adjacent the point of entry established by said conduit means for arresting and altering the direction of motion of said influent feed whereby the influent feed is directed in a horizontally outward direction with respect to said centralized point of entry , means controlling the rate of discharge of solid materials through said bottom outlet means to control and thereby establish settling and sludge zones above and below said centralized point of entry of influent feed , and means for withdrawing a clarified effluent through said top outlet . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ INFRINGEMENT _NEWLINE_ As shown by unchallenged evidence , the accused product performs each of the process steps set forth in claims 1 and 8 and contains each of the elements set forth in claim 9 . The district court 's attention , however , became focused on a mechanical mixer inserted in the feedwell of the accused product , and on the process step performed by it , namely mechanical pre-mixing of the slurry . Led to the erroneous belief that Amstar had argued for patentability on the basis that Eis avoided all mechanical mixing anywhere in the system , under the apparent impression that infringement is avoided when an element of an accused device is not found in the claims , and failing to note the presence in claim 8 of the step of pre-mixing in the slurry , the district court stated : _NEWLINE_ The combinative nature of Amstar 's patent rights effectively limits the scope of enforceable claims under the Eis patent . If Envirotech 's combination of elements differs in a material way from that described by Eis , there is no infringement . _NEWLINE_ A crucial area of difference between the Amstar and Envirotech equipment is the use of sophisticated mechanical mixing to promote flocculation . The Envirotech device is constructed around the multichamber impeller mixing system ; Amstar 's Enviroclear equipment uses no mixing blades , relying instead upon inflow injection of flocculant solution into the feed launder or feed pipe using specially designed nozzles . _NEWLINE_ Following initial rejection of the Eis application , the inventor emphatically argued *1481 that one reason why the Enviroclear process was novel , non-obvious and patentable was its use of other than mechanical means : _NEWLINE_ One point particularly stressed during the interview was the fact that applicant 's claimed process and apparatus effects a separation of finely divided and suspended solids from an influent feed at an unusually rapid rate , without relying upon either the accretion or growth of agglomerates through forced agitation or the use of a free settling zone . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ? ? _NEWLINE_ ? _NEWLINE_ While counsel for Eis was not specifically referring to the mixing apparatus now described in the Emmett Patent and used in the Hi-Capacity Thickeners , it seems plain that Envirotech relies upon mechanical stirring to achieve good flocculation while the Eis/Amstar equipment does not . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ? ? _NEWLINE_ ? _NEWLINE_ Disclaimer of mechanical mixing to achieve good flocculation , made in the course of the prosecution of the Eis patent , would exclude mechanical mixing as an `` equivalent '' as a consequence of this doctrine of `` file wrapper estoppel . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ? ? _NEWLINE_ ? _NEWLINE_ The Eis patent as issued makes no claim which by its terms encompasses mechanical mixing to achieve optimum flocculation . To even accept the argument that the Emmett apparatus is an equivalent , one would have to wholly disregard the positive effects of the mechanical mixing system . This can not reasonably be done in light of all of the evidence . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ? ? _NEWLINE_ ? _NEWLINE_ This Court finds as a matter of fact that the Emmett/Envirotech invention is not the Eis/Amstar invention and concludes as a matter of law that the former does not infringe upon the plaintiff 's valid rights in the latter within the meaning of 35 U.S.C . ¡± 271 . Amstar retains enforceable legal rights in its specific process , but not in the general result . It must be remembered that combination patents are to be carefully scrutinized [ citations omitted ] . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ? ? _NEWLINE_ ? _NEWLINE_ Even assuming that some initial diagrams and models of the Envirotech equipment followed too closely the outline first propounded by Eis , the paths of the parties have long since diverged and initial resemblance , now avoided , has done the plaintiff no cognizable injury or wrong . Plaintiff 's complaint should be dismissed . Defendants ' claims of patent invalidity should be dismissed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Issue _NEWLINE_ Whether the district court erred in reaching its determination of non-infringement . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ OPINION _NEWLINE_ Though literal infringement of a properly interpreted claim is a fact question , its determination may be rendered clearly erroneous through an improper interpretation and application of the governing law . In that event , as here , the determination must be overturned as having resulted from error as a matter of law . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The law of infringement requires that the asserted claims be compared with the products or processes accused of infringement . Graver Tank & Mfg . Co. v. Linde Air Products Co. , 339 U.S. 605 , 70 S.Ct . 854 , 94 L.Ed . 1097 , 85 USPQ 328 ( 1950 ) ; Rel-Reeves , Inc. v. United States , 534 F.2d 274 , 209 Ct.Cl . 595 ( 1976 ) ; Astra-Sjuco , A.B . v. U.S. International Trade Commission , 629 F.2d 682 , 207 USPQ 1 ( CCPA 1980 ) . That was not done here . On the contrary , in the seven pages of the Memorandum Decision devoted to the infringement issue , it is made clear that the district court was led to take a wrong turn in determining the infringement issue . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Infringement is not determined by comparison between parts of the description in a patent and the accused process or product , or by comparison between commercial *1482 products sold by the parties . Accused products made , sold , or used , and accused processes performed , before suit must be compared with the claims . That products may have been modified after suit is brought , and may or may not be accused of infringement , does not remove the need for that comparison . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Modification by mere addition of elements of functions , whenever made , can not negate infringement without disregard of the long-established , hornbook law expressed in Cochrane v. Deener , 94 U.S. 780 , 786 , 24 L.Ed . 139 ( 1876 ) ; Eastern Rotorcraft Corp. v. United States , 397 F.2d 978 , 981 , 104 Ct.Cl . 709 , 154 USPQ 43 , 45 ( Ct.Cl.1968 ) ( infringement not avoided by adding an additional element ) ; McCullough Tool Co. v. Well Surveys , Inc. , 343 F.2d 381 , 402 , 145 USPQ 6 , 22 ( 10th Cir.1965 ) , cert . denied 383 U.S. 933 , 86 S.Ct . 1061 , 15 L.Ed.2d 851 , 148 USPQ 772 ( 1966 ) ( `` But infringement can not be avoided by the mere fact that the accused device is more or less efficient or performs additional functions . `` ) ; Acme Highway Products Corp. v. D.S . Brown Co. , 473 F.2d 849 , 855 , 177 USPQ 130 , 135 ( 6th Cir . ) , cert . denied 414 U.S. 824 , 94 S.Ct . 125 , 38 L.Ed.2d 57 , 179 USPQ 321 ( 1973 ) ( `` An accused device can not escape infringement by merely adding features , if it otherwise has adopted the basic features of the patent. '' ) . Further , the law recognizes the irrelevance of apparatus distinctions in determining infringement of process claims . International Glass Co. v. United States , 408 F.2d 395 , 400 , 187 Ct.Cl . 376 , 161 USPQ 116 ( Ct.Cl.1969 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Thus an accused product could not be found non-infringing because it lacked a flared outlet feed pipe , that element being irrelevant because it is present only in non-asserted claim 11 . Nor could substitution of a rotating disc for the baffle of claim 9 escape infringement , the two being equivalent and the substitution bearing no relation to claims 1 and 8 . Nor could absence from the claims of a limitation to mechanical mixing before introduction of the slurry into the settling zone be thought controlling , when claim 8 specifically mentions pre-mixing ( whether or not mechanical ) and pre-mixing bears no relation whatever to claims 1 and 9 . Similarly , the presence of additional ( `` lamella '' ) plates in some Envirotech drawings can not negate infringement , lamella plates being irrelevant because they are not included in the accused products as sold , because they have no effect on the processes of claims 1 and 8 , and because they are not an element of product claim 9 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Often , as here , consideration of the infringement issue may be benefitted by recognition of the findings made in considering the validity issue ( Envirotech tried various schemes to `` neutralize Enviro-clear 's influence '' and `` counteract the Enviro-clear threat '' ; Envirotech 's apparatus and process `` [ bear ] a striking resemblance to the preferred embodiment of the Amstar apparatus and process described in the Eis patent '' .5 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1483 Important to determination of the infringement issue , also , are the findings establishing the pioneer nature of the Eis inventions ( Eis abandoned the traditional design of thickening equipment ; results obtained were `` surprising '' , `` striking '' , `` unexpected '' and `` synergistic '' ; Eis ' process is `` far more effective '' than conventional equipment ; `` Nothing ... indicated the kind of results one could obtain if the Eis process was used '' ; the entire industry testing procedure was modified or abandoned `` wholly dependent upon the teachings of the Eis patent '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The statute provides no support for the district court 's statement that `` the combinative nature of Amstar 's patent rights effectively limits the scope of enforceable claims under the Eis patent '' . There is no separate classification of `` combination patents '' and no basis for considering claims to combinations of elements differently from any other . Richdel , Inc. v. Sunspool Corp. , 714 F.2d 1573 , 1579 , 219 USPQ 8 , 12 ( Fed.Cir.1983 ) ; Medtronic , Inc. v. Cardiac Pacemakers , 721 F.2d 1563 , 220 USPQ 97 , 100 ( Fed.Cir.1983 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As discussed infra , a statement made during prosecution of the application for the '889 patent which related to avoidance of mixing in the settling zone , can not be applied as a form of estoppel precluding application of the claims to Envirotech 's apparatus which also avoided mixing in the settling zone . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court 's Memorandum Decision overlooked the claim charts ( Px 32 ) introduced and analyzed at trial and presented here as part of Amstar 's brief on appeal . Those charts establish unequivocally that the accused apparatus employed at Envirotech 's pilot plants , and as originally sold to Eagle Coal and Dock and to EFN , constituted literal infringements of claims 1 , 8 , and 9 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The record further illustrates that the modifications assertedly made by Envirotech , whenever they may have been made , are either irrelevant or fail to escape infringement . The accused products , including those modified , are the same , they perform the same function in the same way , and they achieve , as the district court found , the same result as the claimed inventions . See Sanitary Refrigerator Co. v. Winters , 280 U.S. 30 , 41-42 , 50 S.Ct . 9 , 12-13 , 74 L.Ed . 147 , 3 USPQ 40 , 44 ( 1929 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In this case , the merely colorable variations so vigorously pressed by Envirotech are of a kind with those described by the Supreme Court as fostering `` the piracy '' and consequent defeat of the disclosure purpose of the patent system . Graver Tank , supra , 339 U.S. at 607 , 70 S.Ct . at 855 , 85 USPQ at 330 . Infringement is clear on this record.6 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Envirotech 's Brief7 _NEWLINE_ The brief filed by Envirotech on this appeal , presented to assist this court in determining that the finding of non-infringement was not clearly erroneous , contains not one reference to any step of process claims 1 and 8 , or to any element of product claim 9 , that is even asserted to be absent from the accused processes and products of Envirotech . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Unable to point to any part of Eis ' claimed inventions not appropriated by it , Envirotech says it avoided infringement solely because it added mechanical pre-mixing *1484 in the feedwell.8 Unable to escape or distinguish any of the many authorities cited in Amstar 's brief clearly explaining why that position is contrary to law , Envirotech simply ignores them all . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Envirotech 's brief says the modifications discussed by the district court played no role in its non-infringement finding , and that the district court properly found non-infringement because it held that the claims of the '889 patent , in Envirotech 's words , `` did not encompass the mechanical mixing employed by Envirotech to achieve optimum flocculation '' . Envirotech 's brief then describes its pre-mixing impellers and baffles and says `` They can not therefore infringe any claim of the Eis patent '' ( emphasis added ) . Of course `` they '' can not infringe , `` they '' are not charged as infringements , `` they '' , as the authorities make plain , are simply and totally irrelevant , see , e.g. , Eastern Rotorcraft , supra , 397 F.2d at 981 , 104 Ct.Cl . 709 , 154 USPQ at 45 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Envirotech 's brief repeatedly states ( without record citation ) that the district court `` compared the Envirotech apparatus with the Eis claims '' , and , at the same time , that `` a claim-by-claim determination would have been superfluous once the court found a feature [ Envirotech 's mechanical pre-mixing ] missing from all the claims '' . That view would stand the law of infringement on its head , and would fatally undermine the long-established legal principle that non-infringement is shown when an element or step in the claims is missing from the accused product or process , not vice-versa . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Envirotech then says that the district court interpreted the scope of the claims in suit as excluding Envirotech 's mechanical pre-mixing in the feedwell , and that the claims can not therefore be expanded to include a functional equivalent of that pre-mixing in the feedwell . The argument is , in all charity , disingenuous . The list of elements and steps `` excluded '' by the claims in suit , as by every patent claim , is infinite . Nor is there any need whatever to `` expand '' the claims to `` include '' a functional equivalent of Envirotech 's pre-mixing in the feedwell . The existence and function of pre-mixing in the feedwell ( though the district court was led astray respecting them ) are simply of no moment whatever . It is not the law that each element of Envirotech 's accused process and product , or an equivalent of each element , must be found in the claims . The claims are not accused of infringing anything . Envirotech is obviously free to use its pre-mixing chamber per se to its heart 's content.9 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Pre-mixing would be relevant only if it were listed as an element or step in a claim and if it were absent from Envirotech 's apparatus and process . When , as here , Envirotech adds its pre-mixing chamber to apparatus that , in its structure and in the process it performs , literally infringes claims 1 , 8 , and 9 , infringement is not by that addition avoided . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Envirotech says Amstar seeks to define a `` gossamer '' boundary for the claims , and attempts a `` total eclipse of the technology where the district court found the penumbra of the claims strictly delineated '' . As sole support for that statement , Envirotech quotes the district court : `` Amstar retains enforceable legal rights in its specific process , but not in the general result '' , and its statements that the claims `` exclude '' and do not `` encompass '' mechanical mixing in the feedwell . Nowhere does or can Envirotech indicate wherein it is not employing precisely the claimed `` specific process '' , or wherein an unpatentable `` general result '' *1485 is at all relevant . Nor , as above indicated , does Envirotech support the district court 's misinterpretation of the law of infringement reflected in its `` exclude '' and `` does not encompass '' statements.10 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Envirotech 's effort to create a prosecution history ( `` file wrapper '' ) estoppel wastes the court 's and opposing counsel 's time , because the effort is devoted to `` proving '' what is unchallenged and irrelevant , i.e. , that claims 1 and 9 `` clearly '' do not `` include '' mechanical mixing in the feedwell.11 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Moreover , Envirotech argues ( contrary to the record ) that exclusion of such pre-mixing was the sole basis for allowance , and goes on to employ a distorted quotation from Eis ' prosecution history , the distortion constituting a deletion of precisely the language which totally undermines its argument : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As presented to the court by Envirotech , the quote is : _NEWLINE_ ... [ F ] orced hydraulic or mechanical agitation to obtain growth or accretion of agglomerate particles ... is entirely contrary to the concept of applicant 's invention , and would defeat applicant 's purpose through action of fluid forces in shear which would disrupt and break up the dense clumps of agglomerates which form as a result of applicant 's processing . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As it appears in the prosecution history , the full segment reads ( material underlined is that deleted by Envirotech ) : _NEWLINE_ With respect to the cited prior art , it was pointed out that each of the patents to Robinson , Parker et al . and McBride relied upon a forced hydraulic or mechanical agitation to obtain a growth or accretion of agglomerate particles which were then forced upward by the fluid flow to a sludge or solids collector near the top of the liquid-solids contact zone . Such concept is entirely contrary to the concept of applicant 's invention , and would defeat applicant 's purpose through action of fluid forces in shear which would disrupt and break up the dense clumps of agglomerates which form as a result of applicant 's processing . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The portions deleted by Envirotech make clear that the remarks were directed to reactor-clarifiers of the prior art , in which agglomerate particles are `` forced upward '' . That prior art did not deal with `` thickeners '' in which solids are settled by gravity in a settling zone . Indeed , that prior art was so remote from the claimed inventions that Envirotech presented no testimony whatever about them at trial . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Though its Memorandum Decision contains conflicting statements touching the matter , the district court was clearly influenced by the effort of Envirotech to construct a fog of a false estoppel . The district court said , `` Disclaimer of mechanical mixing to achieve good flocculation , made in the course of the prosecution of the Eis patent , would exclude mechanical mixing as an 'equivalent ' as a consequence of this doctrine of 'file wrapper estoppel ' `` . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ It is absolutely clear from the uncropped quote above , and from the prior art listed in the full quotation , that Eis ' counsel was distinguishing from that prior art on the basis that Eis ' inventions avoided mixing in the settling zone , and that counsel 's remarks had nothing whatever to do with mixing of the slurry before it entered that zone . That fact is further confirmed by the submission , contemporaneously with the quoted remarks , of claim 1 with its introduction of the slurry into the settling zone `` without additional agitation '' of the solids mass in that zone , of claim 8 with its additional step of `` mixing producing a liquid slurry '' to be introduced into the settling zone ( a claimed step can hardly be held to have been `` disclaimed '' ) , and of claim 9 which makes no reference whatever *1486 to mixing . Confirmation resides also in the findings of the district court that the Eis process is one for `` settling slurries of finely divided solids without reliance on mechanical agitation '' ( emphasis added ) and that `` counsel for Eis was not specifically referring to the mixing apparatus now described in the Emmet [ Envirotech ] patent and used [ in the accused products ] '' . Envirotech simply ignores the clear showing in the record which directly refutes its `` estoppel '' argument . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Envirotech , as the claims specify , avoids mechanical agitation where the inventions are , i.e. , in the settling zone . Envirotech 's `` estoppel '' argument is simply devoid of merit . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Distortion of the record , by deletion of critical language in quoting from the record , reflects a lack of the candor required by the MODEL RULES OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT , Rule 3.3 ( 1983 ) , wastes the time of the court and of opposing counsel , and imposes unnecessary costs on the parties and on fellow citizens whose taxes support this court and its staff . A quotation containing deletions that so clearly distort the meaning and relevance of the quotation as to render it misleading will not in this court be encouraged by acquiescence.12 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Costs _NEWLINE_ Because Envirotech 's brief relies on a reverse statement of the law of infringement , ignores the numerous and unanimous contrary authorities called to its attention by Amstar 's main brief , distorts a quotation , and presents an estoppel argument based on that distortion , Envirotech shall pay to Amstar an amount equating to double Amstar 's costs on this appeal . Asberry v. United States Postal Service , 692 F.2d 1378 , 215 USPQ 921 ( Fed.Cir.1982 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Remand _NEWLINE_ The case is remanded for consideration of an injunction against further infringement by Envirotech and for an accounting of damages `` adequate to compensate '' Amstar for infringement . 35 U.S.C . ¡± 284 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ REVERSED and REMANDED . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ DAVIS , Circuit Judge , concurring and dissenting . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I concur in the result on the merits and in the opinion with the exception of the parts headed `` Envirotech 's Brief '' and `` Costs '' , but dissent from the award of double costs though I certainly agree that the appellee 's quotation from the prosecution file should not have been cropped . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 730 F.2d 1476 , 221 U.S.P.Q . 649 _NEWLINE_ Footnotes _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As indicated in Environmental Designs , Ltd. v.

Hardy , 727 F.2d 1524 at 1529 n. 3 ( Fed.Cir.1984 ) , the court need only have held that Envirotech failed to carry its burden of proving invalidity . 35 U.S.C . ¡± 282 . A determination that a patent challenger has failed to carry the ¡± 282 burden equates with the reality that the result of a patent trial , like that of any other , binds only the parties and those in privity with them . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 2 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ `` Enviro-clear '' is a registered trademark of Amstar , Registration No . 1,093,696 , dated June 20 , 1978 , for its commercial embodiments of the inventions claimed in the '889 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 3 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ An abuse of the judicial process resides as much in the presentation of a knowingly frivolous defense as in the filing of a knowingly frivolous complaint or appeal . No cross appeal was filed and validity is not challenged on appeal . Apparently , Amstar presented to the district court no claim for attorney fees and costs specifically relating to this `` ironic '' defense . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 4 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court : unnecessarily undertook the extra effort involved in independently re-determining validity ab initio , rather than determining on all the evidence whether Envirotech had carried its burden of proving invalidity as the statute requires , 35 U.S.C . ¡± 282 ; spoke of `` synergism '' and `` unexpected results '' as requirements rather than evidence , see Kansas Jack , Inc. v. Kuhn , 719 F.2d 1144 , 1150 , 219 USPQ 857 , 860 ( Fed.Cir.1983 ) ; quoted indications that `` combination patents '' are somehow different and require special scrutiny , see Medtronic , Inc. v. Cardiac Pacemakers , Inc. , 721 F.2d 1563 , 220 USPQ 97 , 99-100 ( Fed.Cir.1983 ) ; stated that the presumption of validity is `` weakened '' when non-considered pertinent art is introduced ; discussed the obviousness of the `` patent '' rather than of the claimed inventions ; and used the present tense `` is obvious '' rather than the statutorily required `` would have been obvious '' , see Rosemount , Inc. v. Beckman Instruments Inc. , 727 F.2d 1540 at 1543 n. 3 ( Fed.Cir.1984 ) . Those errors , however , tilted in favor of Envirotech and do not in this case affect the district court 's holding of validity . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 5 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Amstar 's brief refers to Envirotech 's `` willful and deliberate infringement '' . Envirotech 's brief makes no claim that counsel was consulted before it elected to produce and sell the accused products . The district court 's findings would appear to support the `` willful and deliberate '' characterization . Nonetheless , no finding of willful infringement was made , and the question is therefore not before us . Presumably , the district court will consider on remand Amstar 's requests for such findings and for costs , treble damages , and attorney fees . _NEWLINE_ Similarly , though Amstar points to Envirotech 's corporate policy of disregarding the patent rights of others , as reflected in its being held in contempt of court four times in a patent case , Peterson Filters & Engineering Co. v. Eimco Corp. , 155 USPQ 89 ( D.Utah 1967 ) , aff 'd , 406 F.2d 431 ( 10th Cir.1968 ) , cert . denied 395 U.S. 963 , 89 S.Ct . 2105 , 23 L.Ed.2d 749 ( 1969 ) ; 166 USPQ 425 ( D.Utah 1970 ) ; 174 USPQ 185 ( D.Utah 1972 ) ; 178 USPQ 337 ( D.Utah 1973 ) , that policy is not before us . Envirotech 's approach to the patent system and its disregard of plaintiff 's patent rights and court orders in Peterson Filters is of general interest , however , in light of its having sought and obtained a patent on one of its modified versions ( Emmet ) . Though that happened seven years after the '889 patent issued , Envirotech did not cite the Eis inventions to the PTO , a lapse on which the district court commented : `` Ironically , the Emmet patent does not list the Eis patent as a relevant prior art example '' . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 6 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court 's treatment of differences in the Amstar and Envirotech commercial products included a statement ( repeated in Envirotech 's brief here ) that Amstar 's approach to equivalence could lead to a conclusion that , except for a simple design difference , `` a Phillips head screwdriver is a standard screwdriver '' . The district court 's error of law , repetition of which is sought here by Envirotech , lies in the failure , as above indicated , to compare the accused products and processes with the claimed products and processes . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 7 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Envirotech challenges none of the findings on which rests the district court 's conclusion that the '889 patent is valid . Nor does Envirotech challenge the district court 's finding that it produced the accused products because its thickener business was `` in jeopardy '' as a result of Amstar 's presence in what Envirotech 's engineers called its `` sandbox '' . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 8 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The equally irrelevant presence of lamella plates and absence of a flared feedwell outlet or a flat baffle plate are not mentioned in Envirotech 's brief . At oral argument it was asserted , without support in the record , that some product of Envirotech discharged the slurry longitudinally rather than outwardly into the settling zone . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 9 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Or to refrain from its use . The uncontradicted testimony at trial was that Envirotech 's customers simply deactivated or removed the mechanical mixers in the feedwell of Envirotech 's products . Whether mixers in the feedwell were or were not used is , however , totally irrelevant . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 10 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Envirotech says its pre-mixing in the feedwell `` promote [ s ] flocculation throughout the apparatus '' , but there is no evidence of record to support that statement . If there were , the assertion would nevertheless be irrelevant in view of the clear infringement of the claimed process and product claims . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 11 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The effort could never establish an absence of `` mixing '' from claim 8 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 12 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In the words of Elihu Root , `` [ a ] bout half of the practice of a decent lawyer is telling would-be clients that they are damned fools and should stop '' . See McCandless v. Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company , 697 F.2d 198 , 201 ( 7th Cir.1983 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_

( `` Teva '' ) alleging infringement of its patents relating to extended release formulations of clarithromycin . Abbott moved for a preliminary injunction against Teva on the grounds that Teva was infringing claims 2 , 4 , and 6 of U.S. Patent No . 6,010,718 ( `` '718 patent '' ) and claim 2 of U.S. Patent No . 6,551,616 ( `` '616 patent '' ) . Teva resisted the motion primarily by arguing that substantial questions existed as to the validity of Abbott 's asserted claims under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 . The district court agreed that Teva had raised a substantial question as to the validity of claim 2 of the '616 patent but it rejected Teva 's invalidity arguments as to the asserted claims of the '718 patent . Accordingly , the district court granted Abbott 's motion for a preliminary injunction . Teva appealed . We have jurisdiction to review the district court 's order under 28 U.S.C . ¡± 1292 ( c ) ( 1 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On appeal , Teva has raised substantial issues as to the validity of each of the asserted claims relied upon for the preliminary injunction . We vacate the preliminary injunction . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I . _NEWLINE_ Clarithromycin is a broad spectrum antibiotic from the macrolide family of antibiotics , all of which are derived from erythromycin A. Taisho Pharmaceuticals Ltd. received U.S. Patent No . 4,331,803 ( `` '803 patent '' ) for clarithromycin in 1982 . In 1991 , Abbott , the exclusive licensee of the '803 patent , introduced Biaxin , an immediate release dosage form of clarithromycin . The '803 patent expired on May 23 , 2005 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1333 In 1997 , Abbott filed for a patent claiming an extended release formulation of clarithromycin . The patent describes and claims extended release ( `` ER '' ) formulations comprising erythromycin derivatives combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable polymer . The resulting drug-polymer matrix leads to the extended release properties of the formulation . The ER formulation enabled patients to take one pill per day rather than twice , as had been required with the immediate release ( `` IR '' ) formulation . That patent issued on January 4 , 2000 as the '718 patent . Further , based on the '718 patent application , Abbott filed a continuation-in-part application that claims a method of reducing adverse gastrointestinal ( `` GI '' ) side effects of erythromycin-derived drug formulations by using extended release formulations . This continuation-in-part issued as the '616 patent . In 2000 , Abbott introduced its ER clarithromycin formulation , Biaxin XL . As of May 2005 , Abbott estimated that , as between Biaxin and Biaxin XL , Biaxin XL accounted for 70 % of sales in the Biaxin market . As the original patent on clarithromycin expired on May 23 , 2005 , generic competitors entered the market for immediate release clarithromycin on May 24 , 2005 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In December 2002 , Teva filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application ( `` ANDA '' ) seeking approval to market an extended release form of clarithromycin similar to Abbott 's ER clarithromycin drug , Biaxin XL . On March 14 , 2005 , Abbott sued Teva for infringement of the '718 and '616 patents.1 On May 18 , 2005 , Abbott moved for a preliminary injunction against Teva . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On May 26 and June 1 , 2005 , the district court held oral argument on Abbott 's motion for the preliminary injunction and thereafter , on June 3 , issued its memorandum opinion . It listed the four factor test for the grant of a preliminary injunction , namely that the party seeking the preliminary injunction must show _NEWLINE_ ( 1 ) the movant has some likelihood of success on the merits of the underlying litigation ; ( 2 ) immediate irreparable harm will result if the relief is not granted ; ( 3 ) the balance of hardships to the parties weighs in the movant 's favor ; and ( 4 ) the public interest is best served by granting the injunctive relief . _NEWLINE_ Abbott Labs . v. Andrx Pharms. , Inc. , No . 05-1433 , slip op . at 3 ( N.D. Ill. June 3 , 2005 ) ( citing Polymer Techs. , Inc. v. Bridwell , 103 F.3d 970 , 973 ( Fed.Cir.1996 ) ) . The district court began its analysis and evaluated Abbott 's likelihood of success on the merits by considering Abbott 's infringement contentions and Teva 's invalidity defenses . Teva did not dispute that its generic ER formulation of clarithromycin infringed Abbott 's '718 and '616 patent claims . Rather , Teva alleged that the asserted patent claims were invalid for obviousness under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 . The court focused on Teva 's invalidity arguments and concluded that Teva had raised a substantial question as to the validity of claim 2 of the '616 patent but it `` ha [ d ] not established that claims 2 , 4 , and 6 of the '718 patent are invalid for obviousness . '' Abbott Labs. , slip op . at 32 . Thus as to the asserted claims of the '718 patent , Abbott had established a likelihood of success on the merits . As to irreparable harm , the *1334 district court first noted that because of its finding that Abbott had proved a likelihood of success on the merits of infringement for the '718 patent claims , there was a presumption of irreparable harm that Teva had to rebut . Furthermore , Abbott contended that it will face `` irreversible market share losses [ if ] ... it loses its preferred position on pharmacy and insurance formularies . '' Abbott Labs. , slip op . at 25 . As a result , the district court concluded that `` entry of the generic extended release formulation competitor will likely crush the market '' and therefore absent the preliminary injunction Abbott would suffer irreparable harm . Abbott Labs. , slip op . at 27 . As to the third factor , the district court stated that Teva was `` reluctan [ t ] or inab [ le ] to quantify the hardship , if any , it will face if an injunction is incorrectly entered '' and `` there is little choice but to conclude that the balance of hardships favors [ Abbott ] . '' Abbott Labs. , slip op . at 30-31 . Lastly , the district court determined that `` [ t ] o the extent that this court has found that the patents in suit are valid , the public interest is best served by enforcing them . '' Id . Based on these considerations , the court issued its order entering the preliminary injunction with respect to the asserted claims of the '718 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ II . _NEWLINE_ On appeal , Teva argues that the district court erred in holding that Abbott had demonstrated that Teva 's invalidity defense to claims 2 , 4 and 6 of the '718 patent lacked substantial merit . Teva also argues that the district court erred in finding that Abbott had established that it would suffer irreparable harm if Teva were not enjoined . As a result of those two errors , Teva alleges that the district court abused its discretion in granting Abbott 's motion for preliminary injunction . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In response , Abbott contends that , as to claims 2 , 4 , and 6 of the '718 patent , it made a clear showing of likelihood of success on the merits and it is entitled to the presumption that it would suffer irreparable harm absent the preliminary injunction . Furthermore , Abbott argues that the preliminary injunction ruling could be affirmed on the alternate grounds that Teva failed to raise a substantial challenge to the validity of claim 2 of the '616 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The grant or denial of a preliminary injunction under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 283 is within the sound discretion of the district court . Amazon.com , Inc. v. Barnesandnoble.com , 239 F.3d 1343 , 1350 ( Fed.Cir.2001 ) . As the Supreme Court recently held on the closely related topic of permanent injunctions , `` [ t ] he decision to grant or deny permanent injunctive relief is an act of equitable discretion by the district court , reviewable on appeal for abuse of discretion . '' eBay , Inc. v. MercExchange , L.L.C. , 547 U.S. 388 , -- -- , 126 S.Ct . 1837 , 1839 , 164 L.Ed.2d 641 ( 2006 ) . `` These familiar principles apply with equal force to disputes arising under the Patent Act ... .. [ T ] he Patent Act expressly provides that injunctions 'may ' issue 'in accordance with the principles of equity . ' `` Id . ( quoting 35 U.S.C . ¡± 283 ) . As the moving party , Abbott had to establish its right to a preliminary injunction in light of four factors : _NEWLINE_ ( 1 ) the movant has some likelihood of success on the merits of the underlying litigation ; ( 2 ) immediate irreparable harm will result if the relief is not granted ; ( 3 ) the balance of hardships to the parties weighs in the movant 's favor ; and ( 4 ) the public interest is best served by granting the injunctive relief . _NEWLINE_ Polymer Techs. , Inc. v. Bridwell , 103 F.3d 970 , 973 ( Fed.Cir.1996 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1335 An abuse of discretion in granting or denying a preliminary injunction may be found `` by showing that the court made a clear error of judgment in weighing relevant factors or exercised its discretion based upon an error of law or clearly erroneous factual findings . '' Id . ( quoting Novo Nordisk of N . Am. , Inc. v. Genentech , Inc. , 77 F.3d 1364 , 1367 ( Fed.Cir.1996 ) ) . We now turn to the factors relevant to a motion for a preliminary injunction . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ III . _NEWLINE_ As to Abbott 's likelihood of success on the merits , `` Teva does not dispute that its generic clarithromycin extended release formulation infringes Abbott 's '718 and '616 patents . Teva asserts that those patents ... are invalid for obviousness under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 ( 2004 ) . '' Abbott Labs. , slip op . at 3 . As a result , `` if [ the defendant ] raises a substantial question concerning ... validity , i.e ... . [ an ] invalidity defense that the patentee can not prove 'lacks substantial merit ' `` then the patentee has not established a likelihood of success on the merits.2 Amazon.com , 239 F.3d at 1350-51 ( citing Genentech , Inc. v. Novo Nordisk , A/S , 108 F.3d 1361 , 1364 ( Fed.Cir.1997 ) ) . Furthermore , as this case involves multiple patent claims , `` the patentee must demonstrate that ... at least one of [ the ] allegedly infringed claims will ... likely withstand the validity challenges presented by the accused infringer . '' Id . As to the burden regarding invalidity allegations , `` [ v ] alidity challenges during preliminary injunction proceedings can be successful , that is , they may raise substantial questions of invalidity , on evidence that would not suffice to support a judgment of invalidity at trial . '' Id . at 1358 ( citing Helifix , 208 F.3d at 1352 ) . As this court has stated _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In resisting a preliminary injunction , however , one need not make out a case of actual invalidity . Vulnerability is the issue at the preliminary injunction stage , while validity is the issue at trial . The showing of a substantial question as to invalidity thus requires less proof than the clear and convincing showing necessary to establish invalidity itself . _NEWLINE_ Id . at 1359 . `` When moving for the extraordinary relief of a preliminary injunction , a patentee need not establish the validity of a patent beyond question . The patentee must , however , present a clear case supporting the validity of the patent in suit . '' Id . ( citations omitted ) . _NEWLINE_ Turning to Teva 's invalidity contentions based on obviousness , `` 'the first step *1336 is to determine the meaning and scope of each claim in suit . ' `` Id . ( quoting Lemelson v. Gen. Mills , Inc. , 968 F.2d 1202 , 1206 ( Fed.Cir.1992 ) ) . `` Only when a claim is properly understood can a determination be made ... whether the prior art ... renders obvious the claimed invention . '' Id . We have stated that `` [ q ] uite apart from the written description and the prosecution history , the claims themselves provide substantial guidance as to the meaning of particular claim terms . '' Phillips v. AWH Corp. , 415 F.3d 1303 , 1314 ( Fed.Cir.2005 ) . `` First , we look to the words of the claims themselves , both asserted and nonasserted , to define the scope of the patented invention . '' Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic , Inc. , 90 F.3d 1576 , 1582 ( Fed.Cir.1996 ) . Where claim terms are ambiguous or disputed , then we turn to the specification as `` the specification 'is always highly relevant to the claim construction analysis . Usually , it is dispositive ; it is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term . ' `` Phillips , 415 F.3d at 1315 ( quoting Vitronics , 90 F.3d at 1582 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Once the scope of the claims are determined , the actual obviousness determination under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 begins . Recently this court re-iterated the proper standards for making determinations under ¡± 103 . In re Kahn , 441 F.3d 977 ( Fed.Cir.2006 ) . First , the court _NEWLINE_ determines the scope and content of the prior art , and ascertains the differences between the prior art and the claims at issue , and resolves the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art . Against this background , the [ court ] determines whether the subject matter would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the asserted invention . _NEWLINE_ Id . at 985 ( citing Dann v. Johnston , 425 U.S. 219 , 226 , 96 S.Ct . 1393 , 47 L.Ed.2d 692 ( 1976 ) and Graham v. John Deere Co. , 383 U.S. 1 , 13-14 , 86 S.Ct . 684 , 15 L.Ed.2d 545 ( 1966 ) ) . In making this determination , we noted in Kahn that `` [ m ] ost inventions arise from a combination of old elements and each element may often be found in the prior art . '' Id . at 986 . The prior art that is considered is drawn from references `` either in the field of the applicant 's endeavor or is reasonably pertinent to the problem with which the inventor was concerned . '' Id . at 987 . _NEWLINE_ However , mere identification in the prior art of each element is insufficient to defeat the patentability of the combined subject matter as a whole . Rather , a party alleging invalidity due to obviousness must articulate the reasons one of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to select the references and to combine them to render the claimed invention obvious . _NEWLINE_ Id . at 986 . _NEWLINE_ This 'motivation-suggestion-teaching ' test asks not merely what the references disclose , but whether a person of ordinary skill in the art , possessed with the understandings and knowledge reflected in the prior art , and motivated by the general problem facing the inventor , would have been led to make the combination recited in the claims . _NEWLINE_ Id . at 988 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In analyzing Teva 's obviousness contentions as to claims 2 , 4 , and 6 of the '718 patent and Abbott 's alternative grounds for affirming the preliminary injunction under claim 2 of '616 patent , we separate the analysis into two parts . Claim 2 and 4 of the '718 patent are closely related and are addressed first . Claim 6 of the '718 patent and claim 2 of the '616 patent are dealt with next . For each pair of claims , *1337 we construe the claims and we determine if the allegations raise substantial questions of obviousness . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A . _NEWLINE_ We begin by examining claim 2 and 4 of the '718 patent and the district court 's analysis regarding these claims . Claim 2 of the '718 patent claims3 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ a pharmaceutical composition for extended release of an erythromycin derivative in the gastrointestinal environment , comprising _NEWLINE_ an erythromycin derivative and _NEWLINE_ from about 5 to about 50 % by weight of a pharmaceutically acceptable polymer , wherein the polymer is a hydrophilic water-soluble polymer , so that when ingested orally , the composition induces statistically significantly lower mean fluctuation index in the plasma than an immediate release composition of the erythromycin derivative while maintaining bioavailability substantially equivalent to that of the immediate release composition of the erythromycin derivative . _NEWLINE_ '718 patent , col. 11 , ll . 28-40 . In short , claim 2 has three basic elements . First , the extended release composition includes an erythromycin derivative . Second , it includes a polymer . Third , the claim includes specific pharmacokinetic parameters that the erythromycin derivative and polymer composition must meet . _NEWLINE_ Similarly , claim 4 claims _NEWLINE_ a pharmaceutical composition for extended release of an erythromycin derivative in the gastrointestinal environment , comprising _NEWLINE_ an erythromycin derivative and _NEWLINE_ from about 5 to about 50 % by weight of a pharmaceutically acceptable polymer , _NEWLINE_ so that upon oral ingestion , maximum peak concentrations of the erythromycin derivative are lower than those produced by an immediate release pharmaceutical composition , and area under the concentration-time curve and the minimum plasma concentration are substantially equivalent to that of the immediate release pharmaceutical composition . _NEWLINE_ '718 patent , col. 11 , ll . 48-58 . As can be seen , claim 4 also has three basic elements : the erythromycin derivative , the polymer , and specific ( but different from claim 2 ) pharmacokinetic parameters . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ From the specification , the district court defined erythromycin derivative in both claims as meaning `` 'erythromycin having no substituent groups , or having conventional substituent groups , in organic synthesis , in place of a hydrogen atom of the hydroxy groups and/or a methyl group of the 3'-dimethylamino group , which is prepared according to the conventional manner . ' `` Abbott Labs. , slip op . at 10 ( quoting '718 patent , col. 3 , ll . 34-39 ) . Notably , this definition of erythromycin derivative includes clarithromycin but excludes azithromycin , a related macrolide antibiotic sold by Pfizer as the drug Zithromax . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Then , construing `` pharmaceutically acceptable polymer , '' the district court again properly turned to the '718 patent specification . The specification describes this as `` a water-soluble hydrophilic polymer selected from the group consisting of polyvinylpyrrolidine , hydroxypropyl cellulose , hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose , methyl cellulose , vinyl acetate/crotonic acid copolymers , *1338 methacrylic acids copolymers , maleic anhydride/methyl vinyl either copolymers and derivatives and mixtures thereof . '' Id . ( quoting '718 patent , col. 3 , l. 65-col. 4 , l. 4 ) . Furthermore , the specification describes the `` 'more preferabl [ e ] ' `` polymer as hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose ( `` HPMC '' ) . Id . ( quoting '718 patent , col. 4 , l. 7 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court also construed the more technical limitations in the claims . In claim 4 the pharmacokinetic limitations require that _NEWLINE_ upon oral ingestion , maximum peak concentrations of the erythromycin derivative are lower than those produced by an immediate release pharmaceutical composition , and area under the concentration-time curve and the minimum plasma concentration are substantially equivalent to that of the immediate release pharmaceutical composition . _NEWLINE_ The district court elaborated on this language by stating that _NEWLINE_ [ t ] his means that the concentration-time curve representing the concentration of drug in blood plasma will be flatter and lower for the extended release formulation than for the immediate release formulation , but will have an area under the curve ( `` AUC '' ) that is substantially equivalent to that of its immediate release corollary . At the same time , the minimum plasma concentration for the extended release formulation will be substantially the same as that of the immediate release formulation , meaning that the drug will be present in the blood at the same minimum level at all times for both the immediate release and extended release formulations . _NEWLINE_ Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court did not address the pharmacokinetic limitations of claim 2 explicitly . Below , in our analysis , we turn to the specification to aid in defining the pharmacokinetic parameters of claim 2 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In making its invalidity contentions , Teva pointed to a number of prior art references . These included published Patent Cooperation Treaty application WO 95/30422 ( `` the '422 publication '' ) . It pertained to controlled-release dosage forms of azithromycin with HPMC that , among other things , was meant to address the GI side effects of azithromycin . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Teva also pointed to Abbott 's own U.S. Patent No . 5,705,190 ( `` '190 patent '' ) which disclosed a controlled release pharmaceutical formulation of clarithromycin combined with a water soluble alginate salt . Furthermore , Teva also cited a number of other prior art references including textbooks and government and trade publications that discussed controlled release pharmaceuticals . The district court characterized these more general sources as `` sources in the prior art discussing extended release formulations and seeking ways to develop formulations that achieved desirable pharmacokinetic goals . '' Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Considering its tentative claim construction and after reviewing these prior art references , the district court determined that _NEWLINE_ Teva has failed to raise a substantial question as to the validity of Abbott 's claim 2 and 4 . The prior art cited by Teva discloses discrete portions of the asserted claims , but Teva fails to demonstrate that this would be sufficient to give a person of ordinary skill in the art a reasonable expectation of success . Teva 's prior art references reveal that using HPMC was a logical line of inquiry but the dissimilarities between the drugs with which HPMC had been successfully *1339 combined and clarithromycin defeat Teva 's claim of obviousness ... . Abbott has provided ample evidence that its invention was not obvious and that there were many other extended release formulations known in the prior art . _NEWLINE_ Abbott Labs. , slip op . at 17-18 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 . _NEWLINE_ On appeal , we begin , as did the district court , with the claims . We agree with the district court 's preliminary claim construction as to `` erythromycin derivative '' and `` pharmaceutically acceptable polymer '' in both claims 2 and 4 . Furthermore , we agree with the district court 's elaboration on the pharmacokinetic parameters of claim 4 . In short , the parameters of claim 4 require three things : _NEWLINE_ [ 1 ] maximum peak concentrations of the erythromycin derivative are lower than those produced by an immediate release pharmaceutical composition , [ 2 ] area under the concentration-time curve are substantially equivalent to that of the immediate release pharmaceutical composition and , [ 3 ] the minimum plasma concentration are substantially equivalent to that of the immediate release pharmaceutical composition . _NEWLINE_ '718 patent , col. 11 , ll . 48-58 . In order to more fully understand these specific parameters , we turn to the specification . It defines a number of the relevant pharmacokinetic parameters used in these claims . The specification defines the `` maximum plasma concentration of the erythromycin derivative , produced by the ingestion of the composition of the invention or the IR comparator '' as CMax . '718 patent , col. 3 , ll . 13-15 . Likewise , the minimum plasma concentration is defined as CMin . '718 patent , col. 3 , ll . 15-19 . The specification defines the area under the curve , AUC , `` as the area under the plasma concentration-time curve , as calculated by the trapezoidal rule over the complete 24-hour interval for all the formulations . '' '718 patent , col. 3 , ll . 26-29 . From these definitions given in the specification , we can describe the three pharmacokinetic limitations of claim 4 as CMax_ER < CMax_IR , AUCER = AUCIR , and CMin_ER = CMin_IR.4 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As to claim 2 , the district court did not explicitly discuss that claim 's pharmacokinetic parameters . Nonetheless , just as with claim 4 , the parameters in claim 2 are defined in the specification . Claim 2 requires that _NEWLINE_ the composition [ 1 ] induces statistically significantly lower mean fluctuation index in the plasma than an immediate release composition of the erythromycin derivative while [ 2 ] maintaining bioavailability substantially equivalent to that of the immediate release composition of the erythromycin derivative . _NEWLINE_ The specification defines the `` degree of fluctuation '' or DFL as DFL = ( CMax-CMin ) /CAv , '718 patent , col. 3 , l. 33 . CAv is the average concentration of the drug over a twenty-four hour interval , '718 patent , col. 3 , ll . 19-22 , and generally is defined as CAv = AUC/£n where £n > > > > > > > > is twenty-four hours . See Shargel & Yu , Applied Biopharmaceutics and Pharmacokinetics 252 ( 3d ed.1993 ) . The '718 patent specification defines `` bioavailability '' as the log-transformed *1340 AUC . '718 patent , col. 7 , l. 17 . Based on this logarithm-based definition , it follows that , at a minimum , where AUCER = AUCIR then the two compositions would have substantially equivalent bioavailability . Thus , sufficient conditions for satisfying claim 2 's pharmacokinetic parameters are that : DFLER < DFLIR and AUCER = AUCIR . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 2 . _NEWLINE_ We now turn to the relevant prior art and begin by focusing on the invalidity allegations surrounding claim 4 . As described above , the prior art includes the '190 patent owned by Abbott . The patent , inter alia , describes and claims compositions of clarithromycin in an alginate matrix . Abbott itself describes that `` the formulations are administered once a day and are directed towards increasing the bioavailability of the active ingredient so that it is bioequivalent with the current immediate release , twice a-day compositions. `` '190 patent , col. 1 , ll . 43-47 . Several disclosures in this patent merit attention . Claim 4 of the '190 patent claims `` a controlled release , solid pharmaceutical composition ... comprising : a therapeutically effective amount of a macrolide ... [ and ] a water-soluble alginate salt ... . '' Furthermore , claim 5 of the '190 patent claims `` [ t ] he composition of claim 4 wherein the macrolide is clarithromycin . '' Thus , the '190 patent discloses an extended release formulation of clarithromycin wherein the polymer used is alginate as opposed to the polymers like HPMC claimed in the '718 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The '190 patent also discloses particular pharmacokinetic parameters for its controlled release clarithromycin and alginate compositions . For example , as pointed out by Teva , a side-by-side comparison of Formula C of the '190 patent with an IR formulation shows that Formula C exhibited a lower CMax ( 2.00 £gg/mL ) than the immediate release formulation ( 2.28 £gg/mL ) and substantially equivalent AUC ( 28.69 ranging from 24.61 to 32.74 £gg h/mL vs. 32.16 ranging from 25.66 to 42.70 £ggh/mL ) and substantially equivalent CMin ( 0.66 ranging from 0.37 to 0.91 £gg/mL vs. 0.72 ranging from .54 to 1.05 £g g/mL ) . '190 patent , col. 7 , table 2 . Thus , Teva makes substantial arguments that the '190 patent discloses a clarithromycin composition with alginate ( as opposed to a polymer like HPMC ) that arguably has the pharmacokinetic parameters required in claim 4 of the '718 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Of the claim limitations in claim 4 of the '718 patent , the '190 patent does not disclose the claimed polymers of the '718 patent . The '190 patent only discloses the use of alginate in making controlled release formulations . Other prior art , though , does disclose extended release formulations with pharmaceutically acceptable polymers like HPMC . For example , the '422 publication filed by Pfizer Inc. , discloses controlled-release dosage forms of azithromycin . In particular , the application disclosed controlled release formulations created from combining azithromycin with HPMC . Abbott Labs. , slip op . at 14 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On appeal , Teva argues that , based on the '422 publication , a person of ordinary skill in the art would replace the alginate of the '190 patent with HPMC because the '422 publication disclosed using HPMC with azithromycin , a compound related to clarithromycin . In response , Abbott points out that most inventions arise from a combination of old elements and that `` identification in the prior art of each individual part claimed is insufficient to defeat patentability of the whole claimed invention . '' *1341 Abbott Labs. , slip op . at 15 ( quoting In re Kotzab , 217 F.3d 1365 , 1370 ( Fed.Cir.2000 ) ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As mentioned above , there must be some motivation , suggestion , or teaching of the desirability of making the specific compound . Abbott argues that such a motivation is lacking here because the compounds azithromycin and clarithromycin are so different that the '422 publication would not reasonably motivate a person of skill in the art to interchange the components of the formulations in the '422 publication with those of the '190 patent with a reasonable expectation of success . The district court agreed with Abbott and found that because of the chemical and metabolic differences between azithromycin and clarithromycin , `` a person of ordinary skill in the art would not have had a reasonable expectation that the azithromycin formulation in the '422 publication ... would lead to the features claimed in the '718 patent . '' Id . at 16 . It is in this conclusion that the district court erred . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court concluded that Teva had not raised a substantial question that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have had a reasonable expectation of success in making the claimed invention . The prior art , however , especially Abbott 's own '190 patent , contradicts that conclusion . As argued by Teva , another claim from the '190 patent merits close attention . Not only does the '190 patent claim compositions with clarithromycin , but claim 14 of the '190 patent claims `` [ t ] he composition of claim 4 , wherein the macrolide is selected from the group consisting of erythromycin , dirithromycin , azithromycin , roxithromycin , and ABT-229 . '' This claim is relevant because it describes Abbott 's own view of the ordinary skill in the art at the time it filed the application that led to the '190 patent and it does so not by what the '190 patent discloses but by what it does not disclose . Claim 4 and 14 of the '190 patent cover compositions that include azithromycin or clarithromycin . Despite these claims to varied compositions , the specification only explicitly describes compositions made from clarithromycin . We presume that Abbott filed and prosecuted the '190 patent representing that claim 14 of the '190 patent satisfies the written description and enablement requirements of 35 U.S.C . ¡± 112 . See Amgen Inc. v. Hoechst Marion Roussel , Inc. , 314 F.3d 1313 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) ( `` [ W ] e hold a presumption arises that both the claimed and unclaimed disclosures in a prior art patent are enabled. '' ) . Because the '190 patent explicitly discloses only clarithromycin controlled release compositions , yet claims azithromycin compositions , we conclude that Abbott has represented to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ( `` PTO '' ) that the differences between clarithromycin and azithromycin were such that azithromycin could be substituted into a controlled release clarithromycin composition by a person of ordinary skill in the art without undue experimentation . See Invitrogen Corp. v. Clontech Labs. , Inc. , 429 F.3d 1052 , 1070-71 ( Fed.Cir.2005 ) ( `` Section 112 requires that the patent specification enable those skilled in the art to make and use the full scope of the claimed invention without undue experimentation ... . The scope of enablement , in turn , is that which is disclosed in the specification plus the scope of what would be known to one of ordinary skill in the art without undue experimentation. '' ) . As a result , based on Abbott 's own '190 patent , there exists a substantial argument that a person of ordinary skill in the art would be motivated to combine the '422 publication , namely the use of HPMC in extended release macrolide *1342 compositions , with the '190 patent with a reasonable expectation of success . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Furthermore , the district court also erred by focusing on the drugs ' chemical dissimilarities , while not properly accounting for their similarities . It appears to have focused on the presence of differences per se , rather than on those differences that would be relevant vel non to one of ordinary skill in the art . For example , the court appears to have been influenced by Abbott 's expert , Dr. Banker , who pointed out that the half-life of azithromycin is longer than that of clarithromycin . Dr. Banker also noted that clarithromycin exhibits an extensive `` first-pass '' metabolism to an active metabolite , whereas azithromycin does not . However , the court appears to have inexplicably discounted the testimony of Dr. Lee . As Dr. Lee noted , because the drug is transformed into an active metabolite , `` a person skilled in the art would have expected that clarithromycin would work even better than azithromycin in an extended release formulation . '' Addressing the drugs ' differences in half-life and metabolism , Dr. Lee concluded that `` these characteristics further support the expectation that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have motivation and a reasonable expectation of success in making a successful ER formulation of clarithromycin ... . '' ( emphasis added ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In light of the record , Teva has raised a substantial question that claim 4 is vulnerable to allegations of invalidity . The '190 patent itself demonstrates that Abbott has represented to the PTO and the public in general that a person of ordinary skill in the art can expect to successfully substitute azithromycin into a clarithromycin controlled release composition without undue experimentation . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Claim 2 presents a slightly different analysis . The prior art and the obviousness discussion from claim 4 could be applied directly to claim 2 but for the differences in pharmacokinetic limitations . Upon inspection , the '422 publication and the '190 patent disclose compositions satisfying the pharmacokinetic limitations of claim 2 and therefore the obviousness arguments from above do apply and provide a substantial argument as to the invalidity of claim 2 . As discussed above , where two compositions have similar AUCs , these compositions have similar bioavailability . The '190 patent discloses compositions with similar AUC 's and therefore there exists a substantial argument that it discloses compositions with substantially equivalent bioavailability . '190 patent , col. 7 , table 2 . Thus , the '190 patent discloses compositions that satisfy the second of the pharmacokinetic limitations of claim 2 . Furthermore , although the '190 patent does not explicitly disclose compositions with a lower fluctuation index , the '190 patent , nonetheless , does so implicitly . By comparing the disclosed pharmacokinetic parameters from the '190 patent , a substantial argument exists that the '190 patent also discloses compositions satisfying DFLER < DFLIR . As discussed above , the '190 patent discloses pharmacokinetic parameters that satisfy claim 4 . In other words , the '190 patent discloses a composition that satisfies : CMax_ER < CMax_IR , AUCER = AUCIR , and CMin_ER = CMin_IR . By examining the definitions given in the specification , we conclude that the disclosed composition from the '190 patent also implicitly satisfies the condition from claim 2 that DFLER < DFLIR . By subtracting claim 4 's third condition from the first , one can infer that the composition from the '190 patent also satisfies CMaxER-CMinER < CMaxIR-CMinIR . This inequality , *1343 with the definition of the fluctuation index , and with the second limitation from claim 4 , establishes that : _NEWLINE_ DFLER= CMaxER-CMinER/CAvER = CMaxER-CMinER/AUCER / £n < CMaxIR-CMinIR/AUCIR / £n = CMaxIR-CMinIR/CAvIR = DFLIR _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In other words , because the '190 patent disclosed a composition satisfying the pharmacokinetic limitations of claim 4 , the '190 patent also disclosed compositions that satisfy DFLER < DFLIR and are substantially bioequivalent.5 Thus , the obviousness arguments relating to the '190 patent and the '422 publication made above for claim 4 can be applied in similar fashion to claim 2 . As a result , Teva has also raised substantial questions as to the validity of claim 2 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B . _NEWLINE_ We now turn to claim 6 of the '718 patent and claim 2 of '616 patent.6 In its analysis , the district began by looking to the claims . Claim 2 of the '616 patent sets forth _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ a method of reducing gastrointestinal adverse side effects comprising administering an effective amount of an extended release pharmaceutical composition comprising an erythromycin derivative and a pharmaceutically acceptable polymer , wherein the erythromycin derivative is clarithromycin . _NEWLINE_ '616 patent , col. 12 , ll . 39-46 . For these claims , `` erythromycin derivative '' and `` pharmaceutically acceptable polymer '' are construed as they are construed in claims 2 and 4 of the '718 patent discussed above . As to claim 2 , the district court relied on the plain meaning of `` reducing gastrointestinal adverse side effects . '' _NEWLINE_ At the district court , Teva argued that _NEWLINE_ [ w ] ell before the invention of the patent , adverse gastrointestinal effects were widely known as side effects of both erythromycin and clarithromycin and , to a lesser degree , azithromycin . In addition , persons skilled in the art knew that one way to reduce these gastrointestinal effects was to formulate the drug in a polymer matrix , e.g. , an extended release formulation . The GI side effects of clarithromycin were known to be dependent on the drug concentration in the blood . Moreover , the '422 [ publication ] for extended release azithromycin disclosed that extended release compositions of that closely-related compound reduced gastrointestinal side effects . _NEWLINE_ Abbott Labs. , slip op . at 21 . In contrast , Abbott argued , inter alia , that `` the gastrointestinal side effects of different active pharmaceutical agents are so distinct that *1344 the pharmacokinetic properties of a formulation with one drug are not predictive of a similar formulation with another drug . '' Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ After reviewing the prior art , the district court concluded that _NEWLINE_ Abbott has failed to meet its burden of demonstrating that Teva 's opposition lacks substantial merit . This court finds that the prior art , specifically the discussions in industry treatises and medical journals of formulations that reduced GI irritation , the teachings of the '422 [ publication ] , and the reference material in the Physicians ' Desk Reference regarding side effects , would lead a person of ordinary skill in the art to expect that an extended release formulation of clarithromycin would reduce adverse GI side effects . _NEWLINE_ Id . at 22 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Claim 6 of the '718 patent claims _NEWLINE_ an extended release pharmaceutical composition comprising an erythromycin derivative and a pharmaceutically acceptable polymer , the composition having an improved taste profile as compared to the immediate release formulation . _NEWLINE_ '718 patent , col. 12 , ll . 23-27 . As to claim 6 , the district court specifically construed the term `` taste profile '' noting that the specification of the '718 patent describes `` taste profile '' in parentheses immediately following the words `` taste perversion . '' '718 patent , col. 9 , ll . 23-24 . The specification defines `` taste perversion '' as `` the perception of a bitter metallic taste normally associated with the erythromycin derivatives , particularly , with clarithromycin . '' '718 patent , col. 3 , ll . 53-55 . Based on this usage in the specification , the district court concluded that `` taste perversion '' and `` taste profile '' are `` used synonymously . '' Abbott Labs. , slip op . at 19 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ At the district court , Teva argued that `` [ i ] t was known that clarithromycin caused taste perversion and this created a motivation for formulators to try to create an extended release formulation that would have a [ n ] improved taste profile . As support , Teva cited a 1993 article written by Abbott researchers , discussing the pharmacokinetics of single- and multiple-dose clarithromycin . '' Id . at 19 ( citations omitted ) . Furthermore , Teva also relied on Pfizer 's '422 publication which , as discussed above , disclosed extended release formulations for amelioration of other macrolide related side effects . Abbott argued that only its own study by its researchers mentioned taste perversion . The other references , like the '422 publication , either describe other non-taste related side effects or they describe `` taste masking '' rather than `` taste perversion . '' Id . Furthermore , as to its one study , Abbott argued that the mere fact that taste perversion is mentioned does not make claim 6 obvious and , additionally , that Teva had not even shown evidence that taste perversion is dose dependent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ After weighing the prior art , the district court _NEWLINE_ agree [ d ] with Abbott that Teva has not met its burden of raising a substantial question as to the validity of claim 6 . Teva relies primarily on only one study , cited apparently in only one article , that mentions taste perversion as a known side effect of clarithromycin , and even then , in only one of thirty-eight research subjects . This court finds that Teva has failed to provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that improved taste profile as a result of an extended release formulation of clarithromycin would have been *1345 obvious to an ordinary person skilled in the art . _NEWLINE_ Id . at 20 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court concluded that Teva failed to raise a substantial question as to claim 6 of the '718 patent but the district court found Teva had raised a substantial question as to the validity of claim 2 of the '616 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 . _NEWLINE_ The district court properly construed the claims for the purposes of the preliminary injunction . `` Erythromycin derivative '' and `` pharmaceutically acceptable polymer '' are construed as above . Furthermore , for claim 2 of the '616 patent , reducing gastrointestinal side effects is given its plain meaning while for claim 6 of the '718 patent , `` taste profile '' is read as synonymous with `` taste perversion . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 2 . _NEWLINE_ We now turn to the obviousness contentions based on the above construction of claim 2 and 6 . Even though claim 2 is a method claim and claim 6 is a composition , they both deal with ER compositions of erythromycin derivatives combined with pharmaceutically acceptable polymers that can improve adverse side effects compared to the IR compositions . As a result , the obviousness analysis is quite similar for both claims . Claim 2 addresses reducing adverse GI side effects while claim 6 addresses improving the taste profile . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ These two claims have three major components . They require an erythromycin derivative , a polymer , and they each recite improvement of a side effect ( taste perversion for claim 6 of the '718 patent and GI side effects for claim 2 of the '616 patent ) . Following the discussion above of claim 2 and 4 of the '718 patent , there are substantial arguments that an extended release formulation with an erythromycin derivative and an acceptable polymer would have been obvious in light of the prior art.7 The validity of claim 2 and claim 6 likely hinges on the extra limitations regarding the claimed improved side-effects . In its brief on appeal , Abbott contends that `` [ t ] he inventions of the patents in suit decrease the incidence and severity of two primary side effects of clarithromycin : taste perversion and gastrointestinal distress ... . [ T ] hese discoveries form the basis of claim 6 of the '718 patent and claim 2 of the '616 patent respectively . '' As to such claims , this court has stated that `` when unexpected results are used as evidence of nonobviousness , the results must be shown to be unexpected compared with the closest prior art . '' In re Baxter Travenol Labs. , 952 F.2d 388 , 392 ( Fed.Cir.1991 ) ( citing In re De Blauwe , 736 F.2d 699 , 705 ( Fed.Cir.1984 ) ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The prior art and Abbott 's own statements in its briefs indicate that the reduction of systemic side effects would not be surprising and would not be unexpected . This , therefore , raises a substantial question as to the validity of the claims . First , as to the GI side-effects , the district court found that the `` GI side effects of clarithromycin were known to be dependent on the drug concentration in the blood . '' Abbott Labs. , slip op . at 21 . Furthermore , the district court found that Abbott contended that `` an extended release formulation *1346 would reduce the maximum blood plasma concentration of the drug . '' Id . Thus , the resulting reduction in GI side-effects can not be said to be unexpected and the district court correctly found that Teva raised a substantial question as to the invalidity of claim 2 of the '616 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Second , as to taste perversion , Teva points to a number of prior art references including a study conducted by Abbott described in S.-y . Chu et al. , Single- and Multiple-dose Pharmacokinetics of Clarithromycin , a New Macrolide Antimicrobial , 33 J. Clin . Pharmacol . 719-26 ( 1993 ) . The article describes a study of single and multiple dose trials of clarithromycin and it reported the side effects encountered by participants including taste perversion . At the district court , Abbott argued `` that Teva 's reliance on [ this ] Abbott study disclosed in the Journal of Clinical Pharmacology overstates its case . Only one of thirty eight subjects reported taste perversion as a side effect , and only at one of four different dosage levels . '' Abbott Labs. , slip op . at 19 . The district court seemingly agreeing with Abbott 's view of that reference concluded that `` this court agrees with Abbott that Teva has not met its burden of raising a substantial question as to the validity of claim 6 . Teva relies primarily on only one study , cited apparently in only one article , that mentions taste perversion as a known side effect of clarithromycin , and even then , in only one of thirty-eight research subjects . '' Abbott Labs. , slip op . at 20 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Upon examining that reference , we can not agree with Abbott 's or the district court 's characterization . In the study , two groups of participants underwent differing treatment protocols . See Chu , supra , at 721 . A group of twenty underwent both a single 250 mg clarithromycin protocol and a multiple 250 mg clarithromycin protocol . Id . From among these two 250 mg protocols , no participants reported taste perversion as a side-effect . Id . Another group of eighteen participants underwent both a single 500 mg protocol and a multiple 500 mg dose protocol . Id . From among these protocols , one participant in each of the 500 mg protocols reported taste perversion . Id . Thus , out of the four trials , neither of 250 mg protocols produced taste perversion as a side-effect while each 500 mg trial produced one reported case of taste perversion . Therefore , Abbott is incorrect in stating that the study only reported taste perversion at one of four dosage levels . Admittedly , finding 0 out of 20 cases in neither 250 mg dosage protocols and 1 out of 18 cases in each 500 mg protocol does not establish that taste perversion is dose dependent but it does support such arguments . Furthermore , as a general matter , the prior art also suggests that a known advantage of a sustained-release formulation is `` a decrease or elimination of both local and systemic side effects . '' Charles S.L . Chiao & Joseph R. Robinson , Sustained-Released Drug Delivery Systems , in Remington : The Science and Practice of Pharmacy , 1660 , 1662 ( A.R.Gennaro , ed.1995 ) . Lastly , Abbott states that `` taste perversion is different from simply an 'unpleasant taste ' of the drug when first ingested ... . Rather , it refers 'to the continuing effect of the drug upon the sense of taste while the drug remains in the bloodstream ... . ' `` In other words , taste perversion is not related to a direct , local taste sensation from the drug on the tongue but is rather a systemic side effect . In regard to systemic side effects generally , Abbott states that `` side effects can be either systemic-in which case they correlate to overall drug levels in blood-or local-in which case they correlate *1347 with the levels of drug being released at the site of irritation . '' From these statements , Abbot suggests that systemic side effects like taste perversion correlate with overall drug blood levels . Thus , Abbott 's own statements from its brief support the argument that reduction of taste perversion would not be unexpected when an extended release formulation lowers the concentration of the drug in the blood.8 Based , on these references and statements , a substantial question exists that the improvement of the taste perversion side-effect would not be unexpected in an extended release formulation of clarithromycin . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Teva has raised a substantial question as to the validity of claim 6 of the '718 patent and claim 2 of the '616 patent.9 The district court was correct in concluding that Teva had also raised a substantial question as to invalidity of claim 2 of the '616 patent and , therefore , claim 2 can not provide an alternative grounds for affirming the preliminary injunction . Furthermore , as discussed above , Teva has raised a substantial question as to the validity of claims 2 and 4 of the '718 patent . As a result it has raised a substantial question of validity with each of the asserted claims but as in Amazon.com , our decision today in no way resolves the ultimate question of invalidity . Nonetheless , for the purposes of the preliminary injunction Abbott as the moving party has not established a likelihood of success on the merits . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ IV . _NEWLINE_ Turning now to the other factors in a motion for preliminary injunction , the district court concluded that Abbott established irreparable harm . See eBay , Inc. , 126 S.Ct . at 1839 ( `` According to well-established principles of equity , a plaintiff seeking a permanent injunction must satisfy a four-factor test before a court may grant such relief ... . These familiar principles apply with equal force to disputes arising under the Patent Act. '' ) . The district court presumed Abbott would suffer irreparable harm absent the injunction because of its conclusion regarding likelihood of success on the merits . Furthermore , and in addition to the presumption , the district court considered Abbott 's economic consequences of denying the injunction and it concluded that `` entry of the generic extended release formulation competitor will likely crush the market . '' Abbott Labs. , slip op . at 27 . On appeal the parties dispute whether the district court properly concluded that Abbott would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction were not issued . Teva argues that any harm that Abbott may suffer could be remedied by monetary compensation . Abbott responds by contending that the sharp economic consequences of open competition from generic drugs establish the inadequacy of monetary damages and irreparable harm . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ First , as noted above , we conclude that Abbott has not established a likelihood of success on the merits . As a result , Abbott is no longer entitled to a presumption of irreparable harm . See Reebok Int ' l Ltd. v. J. Baker , Inc. , 32 F.3d 1552 , 1556 ( Fed.Cir.1994 ) . And as to Abbott 's economic *1348 arguments , we do not doubt that generic competition will impact Abbott 's sales of Biaxin XL , but that alone does not establish that Abbott 's harm will be irreparable . As we stated in Illinois Tool Works , Inc. v. Grip-Pak , Inc. , if this court were to accept a patentee 's `` argu [ ments ] that , 'apart from the presumption , ' its 'potential lost sales ' alone demonstrate 'manifest irreparable harm ' , acceptance of that position would require a finding of irreparable harm to every manufacturer/patentee , regardless of circumstances . '' 906 F.2d 679 ( Fed.Cir.1990 ) . On the other hand , we also note that the district court found that `` the parties ' models of how the market will react to generic competition for extended release clarithromycin remain highly speculative '' and Teva has not proven that monetary damages will suffice . Abbott Labs. , slip op . at 27 . Therefore , where a patentee has not shown a likelihood of success on the merits , and where the patentee has not clearly established that monetary damages could not suffice but the defendant has not established that monetary damages do suffice , we can not say that the irreparable harm prong of the analysis favors either party . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As to the third prong of the analysis , the district court stated that Teva was `` reluctan [ t ] or inab [ le ] to quantify the hardship , if any , it will face if an injunction is incorrectly entered '' and `` there is little choice but to conclude that the balance of hardships favors [ Abbott ] . '' Abbott Labs. , slip op . at 30-31 . As Teva does not appeal this issue , we also conclude that the district court properly found that the balance of hardships favors Abbott . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Lastly , as to the public interest factor , the district court determined that `` [ t ] o the extent that this court has found that the patents in suit are valid , the public interest is best served by enforcing them . '' Id. , slip op . at 32 . Although the public interest inquiry is not necessarily or always bound to the likelihood of success of the merits , in this case absent any other relevant concerns , we agree with the district court that the public is best served by enforcing patents that are likely valid and infringed . As Abbott did not establish a likelihood of success on the merits , we conclude that the public interest is best served by denying the preliminary injunction . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ V. _NEWLINE_ First , in determining Abbott 's likelihood of success on the merits , the district court clearly erred in assessing the content of the prior art . The prior art supports Teva arguments and Teva has raised a substantial question regarding the validity of claims 2 , 4 , and 6 of the '718 and claim 2 of the '616 patent . We conclude that Abbott has not established a likelihood of success on the merits and this supports denying the injunction . Second , absent the presumption of irreparable harm and in light of the arguable sufficiency of monetary damages , Abbott has not established that irreparable harm supports the grant of the injunction . Third , as the issue was uncontested , the balance of hardship still supports the grant of the injunction . Fourth and lastly , as a substantial question of patent validity has been raised by Teva , the public interest benefits from a denial of the injunction . As result of these considerations , we vacate the preliminary injunction . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ VACATED _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ NEWMAN , Circuit Judge , dissenting . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ It has been confirmed that the remedy of injunction in patent cases is subject to *1349 the sound discretion of the district court , upon application of the traditional criteria by which injunctive relief is evaluated and applied . eBay , Inc. v. MercExchange , L.L.C. , 547 U.S. 388 , -- -- , 126 S.Ct . 1837 , 1841 , 164 L.Ed.2d 641 ( 2006 ) ( `` We hold only that the decision whether to grant or deny injunctive relief rests within the equitable discretion of the district courts , and that such discretion must be exercised consistent with traditional principles of equity , in patent disputes no less than in other cases governed by such standards . '' ) _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ These traditional principles are no less applicable when a preliminary injunction is at issue , particularly when the purpose is to preserve-not to change-the relationship of the litigants during the litigation . `` The purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the relative positions of the parties until a trial on the merits can be held . '' Univ . of Texas v. Camenisch , 451 U.S. 390 , 395 , 101 S.Ct . 1830 , 68 L.Ed.2d 175 ( 1981 ) ; Smith Int ' l , Inc. v. Hughes Tool Co. , 718 F.2d 1573 , 1578 ( Fed.Cir.1983 ) ( `` A preliminary injunction will normally issue only for the purpose of preserving the status quo and protecting the respective rights of the parties pending final disposition of the litigation . '' ) Precedent counsels against making an important change in the relationship of the parties while their dispute is being litigated , while recognizing that there may be circumstances warranting such change , when all of the legal and equitable aspects relevant to a particular case are considered . See , e.g. , Mikohn Gaming Corp. v. Acres Gaming , Inc. , 165 F.3d 891 , 895 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) ( the preliminary injunction serves to preserve the status quo `` lest one side prevent resolution of the questions or execution of any judgment by altering the status quo '' ) ; Globetrotter Software , Inc. v. Elan Computer Group , Inc. , 236 F.3d 1363 , 1367 ( Fed.Cir.2001 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The trial court 's decision with respect to the discretionary grant of a preliminary injunction warrants significant deference , for equitable considerations weigh heavily in matters of change or stability pendente lite . See Deckert v. Independence Shares Corp. , 311 U.S. 282 , 290 , 61 S.Ct . 229 , 85 L.Ed . 189 ( 1940 ) ( `` 'It is well settled that the granting of a temporary injunction , pending final hearing , is within the sound discretion of the trial court ; and that , upon appeal , an order granting such an injunction will not be disturbed unless contrary to some rule of equity , or the result of improvident exercise of judicial discretion . ' `` ) ; Meccano , Ltd. v. John Wanamaker , New York , 253 U.S. 136 , 141 , 40 S.Ct . 463 , 64 L.Ed . 822 ( 1920 ) ( `` The correct general doctrine is that whether a preliminary injunction shall be awarded rests in sound discretion of the trial court. '' ) . It is particularly irregular for an appellate court to reverse this discretionary decision and thereby to make a significant change in the relationship of the parties , while presenting no explanation of how the district court abused its discretion . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Reversal of a preliminary injunction that preserves the status quo requires a clear showing that the district court exceeded its discretionary authority . See We Care , Inc. v. Ultra-Mark Int ' l Corp. , 930 F.2d 1567 , 1570 ( Fed.Cir.1991 ) ( `` The court 's determination can be overturned only on a showing that it abused its discretion , committed an error of law , or seriously misjudged the evidence . '' ) My colleagues do not discuss the trial judge 's careful explanations , but , upon finding that Teva has raised a `` substantial question '' about patent validity , they hold that Teva should be permitted to practice the Abbott invention before patent validity is decided . With all respect to my colleagues ' concerns , they misapply not only the criteria of the preliminary injunction *1350 but also the standard of appellate review : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ First , as to patent validity , the panel majority rejects the requirement that in determining the likelihood that the patent will be proved invalid it is necessary to consider the burdens of proof that would inhere at trial . See Canon Computer Sys. , Inc. v. Nu-Kote Int ' l. , Inc. , 134 F.3d 1085 , 1088 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) ( `` However , a patent is presumed valid , and this presumption exists at every stage of the litigation . `` ) ; Genentech , Inc. v. Novo Nordisk , A/S , 108 F.3d 1361 , 1364 ( Fed.Cir.1997 ) ( criterion `` substantial questions of validity '' means that `` in light of the presumptions and burdens that will inhere at trial on the merits '' the attacker has `` a likelihood of success '' in invalidating the patent ) ; PPG Indus. , Inc. v. Guardian Indus. , Inc. , 75 F.3d 1558 ( Fed.Cir.1996 ) ( `` The ultimate question , however , is whether the challenger 's evidence of invalidity is sufficiently persuasive that it is likely to overcome the presumption of patent validity . '' ) In the case now before us the district court analyzed the evidence , in which technologically complex questions are presented , and concluded that Teva was not likely to prove the patent invalid by clear and convincing evidence . In contrast , the panel majority holds that if the attacker raises no more than a `` substantial question '' of invalidity , that suffices to establish the likelihood that the attacker will succeed on the merits . That is incorrect in law and in procedure . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Next , even as the panel majority states its agreement with the district court 's finding that `` the balance of hardships favors Abbott , '' maj. op . at 30 , the majority declines to weigh this factor in its decision . See Chrysler Motors Corp. v. Auto Body Panels of Ohio , Inc. , 908 F.2d 951 ( Fed.Cir.1990 ) ( `` Our rule regarding whether a preliminary injunction should be granted or denied is that the trial court should weigh and measure each of the four factors against the other factors and against the magnitude of the relief requested. '' ) . Abbott points out that the status quo ante will not easily be recoverable if interim infringement is authorized ; Abbott also points out that there is no patent barrier to Teva 's entry into commerce with its own extended release formulation instead of that of Abbott , for the basic patent on clarithromycin has expired . Thus the panel majority again applies a flawed methodology , for `` Where it is clear that the moving party will suffer substantially greater harm by the denial of the preliminary injunction than the non-moving party would by its grant , it will ordinarily be sufficient that the movant has raised 'serious , substantial , difficult and doubtful ' questions that are the proper subject of litigation . '' Ugine-Savoie Imphy v. United States , 121 F.Supp.2d 684 , 689 ( Ct. Int ' l Trade 2000 ) . The district court 's consideration of this aspect was proper , and warrants appellate deference . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Next , the panel majority states that the question of the sufficiency of money damages is `` arguable '' -ignoring the district court 's finding that this aspect may also favor Abbott . Instead , the majority opinion announces that this aspect will not be considered at all . On this accumulation of flaws , and with no reference to the district court 's well reasoned opinion , my colleagues reverse the preliminary injunction , change the status quo , and authorize infringement before validity is decided . I must , respectfully , dissent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Considerations Pendente Lite _NEWLINE_ At issue are claims 2 , 4 , and 6 of U.S. Patent No . 6,010,718 ( the '718 patent ) and claim 2 of *1351 U.S. Patent No . 6,551,616 ( the '616 patent ) . The claims are directed to an extended-release formulation of erythromycin in a polymer matrix , and require that the minimum plasma concentration for the extended release formulation is substantially equivalent to that of the immediate release formulation ; that is , the drug is released so as to be present in the plasma at the same minimum level for both the immediate release and extended release formulations , and with less fluctuation for the extended release product . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In the challenge to validity , Teva and Abbott both presented extensive argument and briefing , citing various references . The district court , explaining its decision on the question of Teva 's likelihood of success in proving the patents invalid , analyzed the evidence and concluded : _NEWLINE_ This court finds that Teva has failed to raise a substantial question as to the validity of Abbott 's claims 2 and 4 . The prior art cited by Teva discloses discrete portions of the asserted claims , but Teva fails to demonstrate that this would be sufficient to give a person of ordinary skill in the art a reasonable expectation of success . Teva 's prior art references reveal that using HPMC was a logical line of inquiry but the dissimilarities between the drugs with which HPMC had been successfully combined and clarithromycin defeat Teva 's claim of obviousness . _NEWLINE_ The district court included discussion of the issues and arguments presented by the parties , remarked on the uses of various known release agents , and the unpredictability of achieving successful extended release as to any particular product . The record shows discussion at the district court that the metabolic pathway of the active ingredient must be determined , as well as the physical and chemical properties and physiologic behavior and effectiveness of the metabolites and their interaction with the materials in the extended release formulation . The record shows discussion at the district court of the need for extended release performance that will produce an effective drug exposure in the bloodstream over the entire release period , and the unpredictability of this performance . The record shows discussion of the non-linear pharmacokinetics1 exhibited by clarithromycin . The district court explained its decision that Teva had not shown that it was likely to prove invalidity of the claimed formulations : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This court is mindful of the Federal Circuit 's warning about the risk of the `` hindsight trap , '' or the post facto belief that an invention , which seems obvious once created , would have been obvious to people skilled in the art at the time . Abbott has provided ample evidence that its invention was not obvious and that there were many other extended release formulation methods known in the prior art . In fact , the existence of alternate methods and the attempted exploitation of some of those methods provide secondary considerations of nonobviousness . These factors suggest that there was a long-felt need for the invention , that others , including Abbott , initially failed to develop the invention , and go a long way to account for the commercial success that Abbott has unquestionably enjoyed with its BIAXIN XL product . _NEWLINE_ The panel majority does not discuss , and assigns no flaw , to the district court 's refusal *1352 to apply judicial hindsight ; nonetheless , the majority applies such hindsight for itself , starting with the template of the Abbott invention and then selecting portions of references to reconstruct the invention within that template . To guard against such incorrect analysis , precedent teaches that references can not be selected , and selected elements from selected references can not be combined , without some suggestion , motivation , or teaching that would make obvious that selection and that combination . See , e.g. , Karsten Mfg . Corp. v. Cleveland Golf Co. , 242 F.3d 1376 , 1385 , 58 USPQ2d 1286 , 1293 ( Fed.Cir.2001 ) ( `` In holding an invention obvious in view of a combination of references , there must be some suggestion , motivation , or teaching in the prior art that would have led a person of ordinary skill in the art to select the references and combine them in the way that would produce the claimed invention . `` ) ; Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. v. Philip Morris Inc. , 229 F.3d 1120 , 1124-25 ( Fed.Cir.2000 ) ( `` a showing of a suggestion , teaching , or motivation to combine the prior art references is an 'essential component of an obviousness holding ' `` ) . _NEWLINE_ The panel majority acknowledges the law , but finds a motivation to make the claimed formulation by combining the information in Abbott 's prior art Patent No . 5,705,190 , which shows extended release formulations of clarithromycin and azithromycin in `` alginate , '' a known release agent derived from seaweed , with a Pfizer publication designated WO 95/30422 , which shows the HPMC ( hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose ) of the '718 patent used with azithromycin . Abbott stated at the preliminary injunction hearing that what works for a product in an alginate matrix is not predictably applicable to other products ; this statement was not contradicted . The district court analyzed the interchangeability of clarithromycin and azithromycin , stating : _NEWLINE_ The questions are : how similar and dissimilar are the two molecules ; and what are the implications of these similarities and dissimilarities to a person of ordinary skill in the art in light of prior art at the time of the invention . Specifically , would a person of ordinary skill in the art have had a reasonable expectation of success in creating an extended release formulation of clarithromycin using a hydrophilic water-soluble polymer based on the prior art , including the '422 patent for an extended release formulation of azithromycin with such a polymer ? _NEWLINE_ The court concluded that they were not so similar as to be interchangeable in the context of polymers like HPMC , correctly rejecting the argument that `` obvious to try '' can establish obviousness . The court stated : _NEWLINE_ Teva 's prior art references reveal that using HPMC was a logical line of inquiry but the dissimilarities between the drugs with which HPMC had been successfully combined and clarithromycin defeat Teva 's claim of obviousness . _NEWLINE_ My colleagues ignore the district court 's analysis , offering neither deference nor acknowledgment . Instead , the panel majority explains that its finding of likelihood of success in proving obviousness is supported `` not by what the '190 patent discloses but what it does not disclose '' ( emphasis in maj . op . ) , proposing that : `` Abbott has represented to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office that the differences between clarithromycin and azithromycin were such that azithromycin could be substituted into a controlled release clarithromycin composition by a person of *1353 ordinary skill in the art without undue experimentation . '' Maj. op . at 17-18 . Thus my colleagues conclude that claim 4 of the '718 patent is `` vulnerable to allegations of invalidity , '' and find `` a substantial argument '' as to other claims . These are not the criteria of likelihood of success . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Reversible error has not been shown in the district court 's analysis , and no basis whatsoever has been shown for overturning the court 's discretionary decision to preserve the status quo while the matter is litigated . Even if Teva had raised a substantial argument , as my colleagues find , the criteria of abuse of discretion have not been met . To support a change in the status quo before the merits are decided , it must be shown to be likely that the patent will be held invalid under the presumptions and burdens in effect at trial . The panel majority is incorrect in holding that it `` require [ s ] less proof '' to authorize infringement before the merits are decided ; such a rule , whereby a patent is deprived of exclusivity during litigation , is not readily invoked , for it is excessively disruptive of the processes of law . As the Court said in eBay v. MercExchange : `` As this Court has long recognized , ' a major departure from the long tradition of equity practice should not be lightly implied . ' `` 126 S.Ct . at 1839 ( quoting Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo , 456 U.S. 305 , 320 , 102 S.Ct . 1798 , 72 L.Ed.2d 91 ( 1982 ) ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Conclusion _NEWLINE_ The district court 's conclusion as to the challenger 's likelihood of success in invalidating all of the claims in suit , and the district court 's view of the balance of harms , are well reasoned and fully supported by precedent . The district court 's ruling , preserving the status quo during litigation , warrants , and requires , our deference . From my colleagues de novo and incorrect contrary ruling , I must , respectfully , dissent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 452 F.3d 1331 , 79 U.S.P.Q.2d 1321 _NEWLINE_ Footnotes _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Abbott also alleged infringement of U.S. Patent No . 6,872,407 and U.S. Patent 4,680,386 but as this case is a limited appeal of the district court 's grant of a preliminary injunction under 28 U.S.C . ¡± 1292 ( c ) ( 1 ) and that preliminary injunction did not extend to the claims of the 6,872,407 or 4,680,386 patent , those two patents are not before us today and will not be discussed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 2 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The dissent appears to take issue with the conclusion that a likelihood of success on the merits is not found where there exists a substantial question of validity . The majority opinion , however , is duty bound by our precedent which states exactly this proposition . In Genentech , Inc. v. Novo Nordisk , A/S , this court stated that _NEWLINE_ In order to demonstrate that it has a likelihood of success , Genentech must show that , in light of the presumptions and burdens that will inhere at trial on the merits , ( 1 ) it will likely prove that Novo infringes the '199 patent and ( 2 ) its infringement claim will likely withstand Novo 's challenges to the validity and enforceability of the '199 patent . In other words , if Novo raises a 'substantial question ' concerning validity , enforceability , or infringement ( i.e. , asserts a defense that Genentech can not show 'lacks substantial merit ' ) the preliminary injunction should not issue . More specifically , with regard to Novo 's validity defenses , the question on appeal is whether the [ defenses have ] substantial merit ... . _NEWLINE_ 108 F.3d 1361 , 1364 ( Fed.Cir.1997 ) ; see also Tate Access Floors , Inc. v. Interface Architectural Res. , Inc. , 279 F.3d 1357 , 1365 ( Fed.Cir.2002 ) , Purdue Pharma L.P. v. Boehringer Ingelheim GMBH , 237 F.3d 1359 , 1363 ( Fed.Cir.2001 ) , Helifix Ltd. v. Blok-Lok , Ltd. , 208 F.3d 1339 , 1351 ( Fed.Cir.2000 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 3 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Claim 2 of the '718 patent depends from independent claim 1 . The language recited for claim 2 includes the combined limitations of claim 1 and claim 2 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 4 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ There is little in the patent itself that establishes the differences ( if any ) between parameters that are simply `` lower '' rather than `` statistically significantly lower '' and the specification does not explicitly define when two parameters are `` substantially equivalent . '' For purposes of this preliminary injunction , we do not reach these more nuanced issues in claim construction . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 5 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As mentioned above , though the inequality follows strictly from satisfying the conditions of claim 4 , this does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the fluctuation index of the extended release formulation is `` statistically significantly lower '' than the immediate release . But nonetheless , the result derived here is enough to show that Teva has produced substantial argument as to the invalidity of claim 2 . This is true despite the example given in the '718 patent analyzing Formula A from the '190 patent for its pharmacokinetic parameters , '718 patent , col. 10 , ll . 62-67 , most notably , because Formula C not Formula A from the '190 patent appears to satisfy the pharmacokinetic limitations of claims 2 and 4 of the '718 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 6 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court concluded that Teva had made a substantial argument as to the invalidity of claim 2 of the '616 patent . In this appeal , Abbott argues that claim 2 of the '616 could form an alternative basis for upholding the preliminary injunction and therefore we also review the parties ' arguments as to the validity of claim 2 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 7 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As opposed to claim 2 and 4 of the '718 patent , claim 6 of the '718 and claim 2 of the '616 do not limit their claimed extended release formulations with any specific pharmacokinetic parameters . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 8 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This does not mean to suggest that lowering drug concentration will lead inexorably to improved side effects ; rather , it only suggests that such an improvement would not be unexpected . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 9 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Other arguments as to obviousness may also have merit such as arguments relating to inherency . See , e.g. , In re Wiseman , 596 F.2d 1019 ( CCPA 1979 ) . But as the arguments relating to unexpected results demonstrate the vulnerability of the claims to invalidity , we do not reach these other , related obviousness arguments . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Abbott explains that `` non-linear '' here means that the amount of drug in the blood is not directly proportional to the dosage amount , but increases disproportionately with higher doses . This is not a characteristic of azithromycin , the product whose formulation is relied on by the panel majority , as discussed infra . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_

Wawa Inc. , 34 USPQ2d 1640 , 1994 WL 750535 ( D.Md.1994 ) [ hereinafter Amhil I ] ; Amhil Enters . Ltd. v. Wawa Inc. , 34 USPQ2d 1645 , 1995 WL 131296 ( D.Md.1995 ) [ hereinafter Amhil II ] . In Amhil I , the district court granted defendant Ivonis Mazzarolo 's ( Mazzarolo 's ) motion to dismiss the complaint as to him for lack of personal jurisdiction . In Amhil II , the court granted defendant M & N Plastics , Inc. 's ( M & N 's ) motion for summary judgment of noninfringement of Amhil 's U.S. Patent No . 4,421,244 ( '244 patent ) , both literally and under the doctrine of equivalents . Amhil had previously dismissed its infringement claim against the other defendant , Wawa , Inc. , d/b/a Wawa Food Market , ( Wawa ) by stipulation and order dated 4 March 1994 . In that same stipulation , M & N conceded that it was properly before the district court . We affirm Amhil II and do not reach Amhil I , which is mooted by our affirmance of Amhil II . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Background _NEWLINE_ Amhil , a Canadian corporation , is the assignee of the '244 patent , which is entitled `` Plastic Lids for Containers '' and which lists Hubert Van Melle as the inventor .

The patent professes that the lids are an improvement over prior lids because , in manufacture , they facilitate fabrication by improving the strip ability from the mold , in shipping and storage , they require a smaller volume than prior lids *1557 required , and , in use , they have enhanced rim-gripping ability for a secure hold . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Amhil filed suit against three defendants alleging infringement of its '244 patent : Wawa , M & N , and Mazzarolo . Wawa , a New Jersey corporation , is primarily a middle Atlantic regional convenience store chain with several stores located in Maryland . Wawa was providing one type of allegedly infringing cup lids to its customers to cover beverages purchased in Wawa stores . M & N , a Florida corporation , manufactures the allegedly infringing cup lids used by Wawa . Two partial cross-sectional drawings of M & N accused lids are depicted below in figure 4 . Mazzarolo is a Canadian citizen who resides in Vaudreuil , Quebec , Canada .

Cramer , 192 U.S. 265 , 275 , 24 S.Ct . 291 , 295 , 48 L.Ed . 437 ( 1904 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B . District Court 's Decision _NEWLINE_ The district court granted , without a hearing , M & N 's motion for summary judgment of noninfringement . In its motion , M & N asserted that the '244 patent did not cover its lids because the accused lids do not have a `` cavity '' that opens `` downwardly and inwardly '' or `` outwardly extending projections , '' each having a `` substantially vertical face '' with `` substantially vertical side edges '' and `` substantially vertical side walls . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court properly applied a two-step infringement analysis : it first construed independent claim 1 and then decided whether claim 1 , when properly construed , covered the accused M & N lids . See Markman , 52 F.3d at 976 , 34 USPQ2d at 1326 ( citations omitted ) . According to Amhil , the district court misconstrued the claim , misapplied the misinterpreted claim , disregarded evidence before it , and improperly drew inferences in favor of M & N , the moving party . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As to the district court 's claim construction , Amhil first asserts that the district court improperly restricted the scope of the claims in suit , making an erroneous `` inside fit '' distinction . Amhil next asserts that the patented lids are used for both hot and cold cups , and there is no hot/cold distinction in the patent or in the claims at issue as found by the district court . Thus , according to Amhil , the district court improperly limited the claims to `` cold '' cups . Third , Amhil argues that the district court improperly found that the patented lids lack flexibility , which is contrary to the specification and claims . Fourth , Amhil contends that the district court erroneously interpreted the `` substantially vertical '' limitation to mean vertical per se . Finally , Amhil asserts that the district court improperly limited the claims to a particular shape . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In support of the district court , M & N argues that the `` outwardly extending projections '' of the accused lids do not have a `` substantially vertical face with substantially vertical side edges and substantially vertical side walls . '' M & N further argues that the accused lids do not have a cavity that opens `` downwardly and inwardly '' as required by claim 1 . Finally , M & N contends that the district correctly concluded that M & N does not infringe , either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ C. Claim Construction _NEWLINE_ `` Because claim construction is a matter of law , the construction given the claims is reviewed de novo on appeal . '' Markman , 52 F.3d at 979 , 34 USPQ2d at 1329 . Claim 1 , the only independent claim in the '244 patent and the only claim at issue here , Amhil II , 34 USPQ2d at 1647 , reads as follows ( material in parentheses and brackets added ) ( emphasis added to contested language ) : _NEWLINE_ 1 . A lid ( 10 ) for containers ( 12 ) , made of thin , flexible plastic , for mounting on and receiving the bead ( 14 ) of a container ( 12 ) , comprising : _NEWLINE_ a central panel ( 16 ) ; _NEWLINE_ a cavity ( 20 ) extending around the periphery of the lid ( 10 ) and opening downwardly and inwardly to receive the bead ( 14 ) of a container ( 12 ) to which said lid ( 10 ) is fitted ; _NEWLINE_ means ( 22,24 ) connecting said cavity ( 20 ) to said central panel ( 16 ) ; _NEWLINE_ a skirt portion ( 26 ) extending downwardly from said cavity ( 20 ) ; _NEWLINE_ said skirt portion ( 26 ) having a plurality of outwardly extending projections ( 28 ) , each having a substantially vertical face ( 1001 ) with substantially vertical side edges ( 102 ) , and substantially vertical side walls ( 30 ) extending inwardly from said face ( 100 ) ; _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ the portions ( 32 ) of said skirt ( 26 ) that are between said outwardly extending projections *1559 ( 28 ) extending inwardly to a waist portion ( 34 ) having [ sic , having ] a plurality of interruptions ( 104 ) , one at each projection ( 28 ) , and forming an undercut defining said cavity ( 20 ) in said waist portion ( 34 ) [ sic , said lid ( 10 ) ] ; _NEWLINE_ said outwardly extending projections ( 28 ) and said waist portion ( 34 ) [ sic , said portions ( 32 ) -see col. 4 , ll . 33-36 and figures 1-3 above ] all terminating in their lower extremities at a downwardly and outwardly sloped lower band portion ( 36 ) ; _NEWLINE_ and said outwardly extending projections ( 28 ) terminating in their upper extremities at a respective upper , band portion ( 42 ) extending inwardly and upwardly from the upper edge [ edge between each portion ( 42 ) and projection ( 28 ) ] of each said respective vertical face ( 100 ) and terminating at said cavity ( 20 ) in an upper undercut ( 44 ) which is higher and less inwardly extending than the undercut of said waist portion ( 34 ) , and which defines the peripheral cavity [ part of entire cavity ( 20 ) ] over said outwardly extending projections ( 28 ) . _NEWLINE_ M & N and Amhil focus their claim construction arguments on two primary issues : _NEWLINE_ ( 1 ) whether the `` cavity '' ( compare element 20 in figures 2 and 3 above , which are figures from the '244 patent , with element 20 in figure 4 above , which depicts the accused M & N lid ) of the accused lids opens `` downwardly and inwardly '' as required by the third paragraph of claim 1 , and _NEWLINE_ ( 2 ) whether the `` outwardly extending projections '' of the accused lids have `` substantially vertical '' faces ( compare element 100 in figures 1-3 above , which are figures from the '244 patent , with element 100 in figure 4 and the portion labeled `` Face '' in figure 8 below , which depict the accused M & N lid ) , side edges , and side walls as required by the sixth paragraph of claim 1 . _NEWLINE_ Looking at issue ( 2 ) , we note that the sixth paragraph of claim 1 requires the skirt portion to comprise a plurality of `` outwardly extending projections , '' each having a `` substantially vertical face '' with `` substantially vertical side edges , '' and `` substantially vertical side walls . '' It is clear from the specification that the adverb `` outwardly '' means in a direction from inside the container to outside the container and perpendicular to the container 's longitudinal axis . The parties hotly contest how to define the effect of the `` substantially vertical '' limitation as it relates to the faces , side edges , and side walls on the outwardly extending projections . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ It is apparent that the faces 100 of the outwardly extending projections 28 in the preferred embodiment of the '244 patent are vertical . This may be seen , for example , in figures 2 and 3 above and is also evident from the description of the side edges 102 in the preferred embodiment as being vertical . A preferred embodiment , however , is just that , and the scope of a patentee 's claims is not necessarily or automatically limited to the preferred embodiment . The entire specification , including all of the claims , the prosecution history , and the prior art may all affect the interpretation ultimately placed on claim language . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We first review the entire specification , including all of the claims . In the specification , the patentee used `` substantially vertical '' and `` vertical '' interchangeably when describing the faces of the projections . Even within claim 1 , the patentee used `` substantially vertical face '' interchangeably with `` vertical face . '' Compare ? 6 ( `` substantially vertical face '' ) with ? 9 ( `` vertical face '' ) . The entire specification thus leaves its reader with the impression that `` substantially vertical '' and `` vertical '' mean essentially the same thing in the '244 patent , at least as to the faces . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We next review the prosecution history of the '244 patent to ascertain the true meaning or effect in the claims of the adverb `` substantially '' in the claim limitation `` substantially vertical faces . '' The prosecution history , in addition to being used while considering the factual issue of infringement and whether prosecution history estoppel places any limitations on what infringes a claim , should also be used when considering the legal issue of proper claim construction . SSIH Equip . S.A. v. United States Int ' l Trade Comm ' n , 718 F.2d 365 , 376 , 218 USPQ 678 , 688 , 1 Fed . Cir . ( T ) 90 , 102 ( 1983 ) ( prosecution *1560 history `` is always relevant to a proper interpretation of a claim '' ) ( citing Astra Sjuco A.B . v. United States Int ' l Trade Comm ' n , 67 C.C.P.A . 128 , 629 F.2d 682 , 686 , 207 USPQ 1 , 5 ( 1980 ) ; Autogiro Co. of Am . v. United States , 181 Ct.Cl . 55 , 384 F.2d 391 , 395-99 , 155 USPQ 697 , 701-04 ( 1967 ) ) . An examination of the prosecution history is particularly important where , as in the instant case , the claimed invention is in a crowded art . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ During prosecution of the application for the '244 patent ( '244 application ) , the examiner , inter alia , rejected the claims under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 as unpatentable over U.S. Patent No . 4,194,645 ( Zabner '645 ) in view of U.S. Patent No . 3,353,708 ( Davis '708 ) . Fig . 3 of Zabner '645 is reproduced below as figure 5 . Figs . 1 and 4 of Davis '708 are reproduced below as figure 6 . According to the examiner , `` [ t ] o modify [ Zabner '645 ] by providing portion 44 as discontinuous portions with a substantially vertical face , side edges and side walls would be obvious in view of [ Davis '708 ] . '' Portion 44 of Zabner '645 corresponds to face 100 in the '244 patent . The examiner thus opined that the lid described in Zabner '645 closely approximated the lid claimed in the '244 application , the main difference between the two being the claimed substantially vertical faces , side edges , and side walls . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ? _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1561 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ? _NEWLINE_ In response to the ¡± 103 rejection , the patentee asserted that , unlike Zabner '645 , the lid claimed in the '244 application had projections with substantially vertical faces and side edges , making the '244 lid easy to strip from the mold , while providing a much deeper undercut . Since the patentee distinguished Zabner '645 based in part on the slope of the projection faces , `` substantially vertical '' may be properly interpreted as not including lids with sloping faces like those of Zabner '645 . In this regard , one should also note the sloped faces of the Mahaffy '036 lid depicted in figure 7 below . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ? _NEWLINE_ *1562 We also note that , during prosecution of the '244 application , the patentee again used `` substantially vertical '' and `` vertical '' interchangeably when describing the faces of the projections . For example , in his response to the first office action , the patentee alternated , first referring to the faces as `` substantially vertical '' then `` vertical '' then `` substantially vertical '' then `` vertical '' then `` substantially vertical . '' This provides a further indication that the patentee thought of his substantially vertical faces as essentially vertical . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Finally , it is apparent from our review of the prior art of record that lids of the general construction claimed in the '244 patent were common in the industry . Several prior art lids depict outwardly extending projections with variously sloped outward faces as may be seen in the figures from some prior art lid patents reproduced in the attached appendix . In order for claim 1 of the '244 patent to `` avoid '' these prior art lids , `` substantially vertical face '' must be construed as the same as or very close to `` vertical face . '' See ACS Hosp . Sys. , Inc. v. Montefiore Hosp. , 732 F.2d 1572 , 1577 , 221 USPQ 929 , 932 ( Fed.Cir.1984 ) ( `` claims should be so construed , if possible , as to sustain their validity '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We conclude from our review of the district court 's opinion and from our de novo review of the entire specification , the prosecution history , and the prior art that claim 1 does not permit Amhil to exclude from the marketplace lids having protrusions with sloping faces like the faces shown , for example , in Zabner '645 and Mahaffy '036 . In particular , we interpret claim 1 to include only lids wherein the outwardly extending projections have well-defined faces that deviate only slightly , if at all , from the vertical . Any other construction of claim 1 would render it invalid . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ D. Literal Infringement _NEWLINE_ Literal infringement of a claim exists when every limitation recited in the claim is found in the accused device , i.e. , when the properly construed claim reads on the accused device exactly . Johnston v. IVAC Corp. , 885 F.2d 1574 , 1580 , 12 USPQ2d 1382 , 1386 ( Fed.Cir.1989 ) ( citing cases ) . Whether the properly construed claim in issue reads on the devices accused of infringing is a question of fact , which we review for clear error . Hilton Davis Chem . Co. v. Warner-Jenkinson Co. , 62 F.3d 1512 , 1520 , 35 USPQ2d 1641 , 1647 ( Fed.Cir.1995 ) ( in banc ) ( `` Infringement , whether literal or under the doctrine of equivalents , is a question of fact . '' ) ( citing Winans v. Denmead , 56 U.S. ( 15 How . ) 330 , 338 , 14 L.Ed . 717 ( 1853 ) ; SRI Int ' l v. Matsushita Elec . Corp. of Am. , 775 F.2d 1107 , 1125 , 227 USPQ 577 , 589 ( Fed.Cir.1985 ) ( in banc ) ) , cert . granted , -- - U.S. -- -- , 116 S.Ct . 1014 , 134 L.Ed.2d 95 ( 1996 ) . `` A finding is 'clearly erroneous ' when although there is evidence to support it , the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed . '' United States v. United States Gypsum Co. , 333 U.S. 364 , 395 , 68 S.Ct . 525 , 542 , 92 L.Ed . 746 , 76 USPQ 430 , 443 ( 1948 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We agree with the district court 's observation that `` the 'outwardly extending projections ' on the accused lids slope upwardly and inwardly towards the peripheral cavity . '' Amhil II , 34 USPQ2d at 1648 . The faces of the projections thus slope upwardly and inwardly . `` Substantially vertical faces '' are not present , therefore , in the M & N lids as we have construed that claim limitation above . A comparison of figure 5 above with figure 8 below supports this . Figure 8 depicts the composite rendering of two scale tracings of the accused M & N lid . Except for the `` face '' label that we added , this drawing was attached to Van Melle 's declaration filed in opposition to M & N 's motion for summary judgment . Figure 5 depicts the Zabner '645 lid , wherein portion 44 corresponds to the `` face '' in figure 8 . It is apparent that the slopes of these `` faces '' are very similar . Consequently , on the entire evidence , we are not left with a definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a mistake in finding that M & N 's lids do not literally infringe the '244 patent . The district court 's finding of no literal infringement is not clearly erroneous and is affirmed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1563 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ? _NEWLINE_ In light of this holding , we find it unnecessary to determine whether the accused M & N lids comprise `` substantially vertical side edges '' or `` substantially vertical side walls . '' Similarly , we find it unnecessary to analyze whether the accused M & N lids comprise the disputed `` downwardly and inwardly '' opening cavity extending around the periphery of the lid . We also find it unnecessary to reach Amhil 's assertions that the district court improperly read a cold-use limitation into the claims , that the district court improperly distinguished the accused lids because they employ a plug-fit or inside-fit design , or that the district court improperly found that the accused lids are formed from material that lacks flexibility . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ E. Infringement Under the Doctrine of Equivalents _NEWLINE_ After deciding that there was no literal infringement of the '244 patent , the district court correctly went on to decide whether there was infringement under the doctrine of equivalents . See Hilton Davis , 62 F.3d at 1522 , 35 USPQ2d at 1648 ( `` The trial judge does not have discretion to choose whether to apply the doctrine of equivalents when the record shows no literal infringement. '' ) . Like literal infringement , infringement under the doctrine of equivalents is an issue of fact . Id . at 1521 , 35 USPQ2d at 1647 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Nowhere in its opening brief did appellant Amhil mention infringement under the doctrine of equivalents . Amhil 's only mention of the doctrine of equivalents appears in one paragraph on the penultimate page of its reply brief . A reply brief , which should `` reply to the brief of the appellee , '' see Fed . R.App . P. 28 ( c ) , is not the appropriate place to raise , for the first time , an issue for appellate review . We hold , therefore , that Amhil has waived its right to appeal that portion of the district court 's grant of summary judgment of noninfringement under the doctrine of equivalents . See *1564 Becton Dickinson & Co. v. C.R . Bard , Inc. , 922 F.2d 792 , 800 , 17 USPQ2d 1097 , 1103 ( Fed.Cir.1990 ) ( `` an issue not raised by an appellant in its opening brief ... is waived '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ III _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Amhil I : Personal Jurisdiction Over Mazzarolo _NEWLINE_ As a result of our holdings above , that the M & N lids do not infringe the '244 patent , we need not decide whether the district court , in Amhil I , properly granted Mazzarolo 's motion to dismiss the complaint as to him for lack of personal jurisdiction . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ IV _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Conclusion _NEWLINE_ For the above reasons , we affirm Amhil II 's summary judgment of no infringement . The appeal in Amhil I and the issue of personal jurisdiction over Mazzarolo are now moot . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Each party shall bear its own costs . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ AFFIRMED . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1565 Appendix _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ? _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 81 F.3d 1554 , 38 U.S.P.Q.2d 1471 _NEWLINE_ Footnotes _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The '244 patent does not contain reference numbers for the faces , the side edges , or the interruptions .

( together `` White '' ) appeal the decision1 of the United *1297 States District Court for the District of Minnesota granting summary judgment that White infringed United States Patent No . 4,694,528 , assigned to The Toro Company ( `` Toro '' ) . We have construed the claims de novo , as precedent requires . On the correct claim construction , the judgment of literal infringement can not stand . We reverse the judgment , and remand for determination of infringement by application of the doctrine of equivalents . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ BACKGROUND _NEWLINE_ The '528 patent describes and claims a hand-held convertible vacuum/blower , an implement for yard work that can be used both as a vacuum cleaner for collecting leaves and other debris , and as a blower for dispersing the same . In both modes a centrifugal fan ( called an impeller ) rotating in a housing moves air through the device in a constant direction , sucking air in through an air inlet , and blowing air out through an air outlet or exhaust . For use in vacuum cleaner mode , the operator connects a vacuum tube and nozzle to the air inlet and places a collection bag over the air outlet . Debris is sucked into the impeller where it is mulched by action of the fan and then blown through the air outlet into the collection bag . For use as a blower , the operator connects a directing tube to the air outlet and places a protective cover over the air inlet opening to keep hands , clothing and debris clear of the fan . Such devices were known to the prior art . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The '528 patent is directed to a vacuum/blower wherein the air velocity is adjusted depending on whether the device is used as a vacuum cleaner or as a blower . The velocity of the air during use as a blower is increased by reducing the size of the air inlet.2 In vacuum mode , however , such reduction of the air inlet opening is not desired , for twigs and other debris can more easily clog the inlet , thus impeding operation of the device . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In the device as claimed in the '528 patent , the cover is fitted with a ring that restricts the size of the air inlet in blower mode and prevents air spill between the high pressure side and the low pressure side of the impeller blades . As illustrated in patent Figure 4 , this restriction ring ( 76 ) is attached to the air inlet cover , which itself has apertures through which air passes . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ FIG . 4 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ? _NEWLINE_ *1298 In blower mode the air inlet cover bearing the restriction ring is placed on the air inlet opening , whereby the ring reduces the total air inlet , thus optimizing operation as a blower . In vacuum mode the air inlet cover is removed and replaced by the vacuum nozzle , the inlet having the larger aperture desirable for vacuum operation . The '528 patent emphasizes that by attaching the air flow restriction ring to the air inlet cover , i.e. , `` as part of the air inlet cover , '' the ring will always be located precisely where it is needed to automatically restrict the air flow when the air inlet cover is in place . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ White , a manufacturer of similar devices , upon Toro 's introduction of its improved model embodying the patented structure , attempted to design around the '528 patent . In White 's design the air inlet is also restricted by a ring that is present during operation as a blower and absent in vacuum mode , as in the '528 patent . But unlike Toro 's vacuum/blower , White 's restriction ring is not attached as part of the air inlet cover but is a separate part . White 's ring is manually inserted into the air inlet opening under the cover during blower operation , and removed along with the cover for vacuum operation . White 's restriction ring is not automatically removed with White 's cover , but must be separately lifted out . In addition , White 's cover is not completely separable from the housing , but swings open on a hinge . White states that its overall design does not incorporate the invention of the '528 patent and constitutes a successful attempt to design around its claims . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Toro charged White with infringement of claims 16 and 17 of the '528 patent ( bracketed numerals added ) : _NEWLINE_ 16 . A convertible vacuum-blower comprising : _NEWLINE_ [ 1 ] a housing having an air inlet and an air outlet ; _NEWLINE_ [ 2 ] a motor supported in said housing _NEWLINE_ [ 3 ] an impeller having a plurality of impeller blades supported for rotary motion in said housing , in fluid communication with said air inlet and said air outlet , and rotatably driven by said motor ; _NEWLINE_ [ 4 ] a removable air inlet cover for covering said air inlet , said air inlet cover having apertures for passage of air through the cover ; _NEWLINE_ [ 5 ] attachment means for removably securing said air inlet cover to said housing ; and _NEWLINE_ [ 6 ] said cover including means for increasing the pressure developed by said vacuum-blower during operation as a blower when air is being supplied to said impeller through said apertured cover . _NEWLINE_ 17 . A convertible vacuum-blower in accordance with claim 16 wherein _NEWLINE_ [ 7 ] said pressure differential increasing means includes a ring carried by said cover and disposed sufficiently close to said impeller to prevent air spill over between the high pressure side and low pressure side of said impeller blades during rotation of said impeller . _NEWLINE_ The district court construed the claims , as mandated by Markman v. Westview Instruments , Inc. , 517 U.S. 370 , 116 S.Ct . 1384 , 134 L.Ed.2d 577 , 38 USPQ2d 1461 ( 1996 ) . The court then granted Toro 's motion for summary judgment that claim 16 of the '528 patent was literally infringed by the accused devices . Toro conceded that claim 17 was not literally infringed . The charge of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents was not reached during the summary proceedings . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ CLAIM CONSTRUCTION _NEWLINE_ White argues that the district court incorrectly construed the terms `` air inlet cover '' and `` attachment means for removably securing '' in claim clause [ 5 ] , and `` cover including means for increasing the pressure '' in clause [ 6 ] . White states that on this incorrect construction , summary judgment of infringement was improperly granted . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1299 The district court applied the general rule that words in patent claims are given their ordinary meaning in the usage of the field of the invention , unless the text of the patent makes clear that a word was used with a special meaning . See Multiform Desiccants , Inc. v. Medzam , Ltd. , 133 F.3d 1473 , 1477 , 45 USPQ2d 1429 , 1432 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) ( `` It is the person of ordinary skill in the field of the invention through whose eyes the claims are construed . Such person is deemed to read the words used in the patent documents with an understanding of their meaning in the field , and to have knowledge of any special meaning and usage in the field . `` ) ; Hoechst Celanese Corp. v. B.P . Chems . Ltd. , 78 F.3d 1575 , 1578 , 38 USPQ2d 1126 , 1129 ( Fed.Cir.1996 ) ( `` A technical term used in a patent document is interpreted as having the meaning that it would be given by persons experienced in the field of the invention , unless it is apparent from the patent and the prosecution history that the inventor used the term with a different meaning . `` ) ; Carroll Touch , Inc. v. Electro Mechanical Sys. , Inc. , 15 F.3d 1573 , 1577 , 27 USPQ2d 1836 , 1840 ( Fed.Cir.1993 ) . In the '528 specification no special meaning in the field of the invention is attributed to the words `` cover , '' `` included , '' `` attachment , '' and `` removable . '' However , words of ordinary usage must nonetheless be construed in the context of the patent documents . Thus the court must determine how a person of experience in the field of this invention would , upon reading the patent documents , understand the words used to define the invention . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Toro and White had each relied on dictionary definitions of the common words `` cover , '' `` attachment , '' `` removable , '' and `` included , '' each choosing definitions that favored its position . As this case well illustrates , the dictionary definitions of common words are often less useful than the patent documents themselves in establishing the usage of ordinary words in connection with the claimed subject matter . This is not an issue of the richness of language , or variety or imprecision in the usage of words . Determining the limits of a patent claim requires understanding its terms in the context in which they were used by the inventor , considered by the examiner , and understood in the field of the invention . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In judicial `` claim construction '' the court must achieve the same understanding of the patent , as a document whose meaning and scope have legal consequences , as would a person experienced in the technology of the invention . Such a person would not rely solely on a dictionary of general linguistic usage , but would understand the claims in light of the specification and the prior art , guided by the prosecution history and experience in the technologic field . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A _NEWLINE_ The district court relied on the dictionary definition of `` cover '' as `` something that protects , shelters or guards ; ... something that is placed over or about another thing , '' and construed `` cover '' as it relates to the claimed vacuum/blower as `` that which functions to overlay and conceal the air inlet and serves to guard the impeller . '' White does not challenge this definition , but argues that its device does not have an `` attachment means '' whereby its cover is `` removably secured '' to the housing , as required by clause [ 5 ] . White states that its cover is hinged and latched and thus is different from and not equivalent to the `` attachment means for removably securing '' the cover , shown in the specification as a twist-lock tab and detent system . White states that its hinged cover is shown in a prior art patent to Mattson , and suggests that the tab and detent system was adopted by Toro in order to differentiate its device from that of Mattson . Toro agrees that a hinged cover is shown in Mattson , which is mentioned in column 1 of the '528 patent . However , Toro argues that this reference provides support for viewing the hinge as an equivalent attachment means in terms of '112 ? 6 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1300 The district court construed the `` attachment means for removably securing said air inlet cover to said housing '' of clause [ 5 ] as including the hinge of the White device whereby the cover , when lifted from the air inlet , remains attached to the housing . White points out that the cover in its device is not removable from but remains attached to the impeller housing , and argues that the specification of the '528 patent shows that the Toro inventor did not intend to include such structures , which were in the prior art Mattson patent . The district court held that `` White fails to distinguish between the cover and the attachment means . With the use of a hinge and latch , the cover is removable from the housing covering the air inlet , even though the attachment means , the hinge and latch , are still attached to the housing . '' The court held that the term `` removably securing '' does not require that the cover be entirely separated from the housing , but simply refers to removal of the cover from the air inlet . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This question can not be decided by a dictionary . Dictionaries are useful additional sources , as is the guidance of technical/scientific experts and other relevant evidence , in addition to the patent documents themselves , that may aid the judge in achieving the understanding and viewpoint of a person having experience in the field of the invention . However , dictionaries provide general definitions , rarely in sufficient detail to resolve close questions in particular contexts . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ White argues that the attachment means of clause [ 5 ] , illustrated in the specification as a tab-and-detent structure , does not reach the latch and hinge whereby the cover is attached to the housing and secured to the air inlet opening in the White device . The district court correctly held that it is irrelevant whether the cover in the accused device is attached to the housing , for clause [ 5 ] relates only to the attachment means for removably securing the cover to the air inlet opening . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Applying '112 ? 6 , the district court did not clearly err in ruling that the hinge and latch of the accused device is equivalent to the tab-and-detent illustrated in the '528 patent . The use of a latch with a hinged cover is shown in the prior art , performing the identical function of securing the cover to the air inlet during use as a blower , using known interchangeable structures . Cf . Rite-Hite Corp. v. Kelley Co. , 819 F.2d 1120 , 1124 , 2 USPQ2d 1915 , 1918 ( Fed.Cir.1987 ) ( equivalence of rack-and-pinion with ratchet-and-pawl ) . Although White argues that section 112 ? 6 requires that the asserted equivalent is described in the specification , that is an incorrect statutory interpretation , for such a requirement would render the statutory provision meaningless . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court 's interpretation of the attachment means of clause [ 5 ] is affirmed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B _NEWLINE_ White also argues that its pressure increasing means , the restriction ring , is not `` includ [ ed ] '' in the cover as required by claim clause [ 6 ] because the ring is not attached to the cover but is an entirely separate component . The district court held that the term `` including , '' correctly construed , `` suggests the containment of something as a component or subordinate part of a larger whole , '' and comprehends a separate restriction ring that is not part of the cover but is separately inserted and removed . The court construed `` cover '' to `` include '' both the flap that closes over the air inlet and the restriction ring , explaining that each `` overlays '' and `` guards '' the impeller . Thus the court construed clause [ 6 ] to mean that the cover includes the restriction ring whether or not the ring is attached to the cover . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The dictionary definitions of `` cover '' and of `` including '' do not shed dispositive light on whether the phrase `` cover including means for increasing the pressure '' is correctly construed as requiring a mechanical attachment between the cover and the restriction ring . Whether clause [ 6 ] requires *1301 that the ring be attached to the cover is not a question of '112 ? 6 . It is a matter of interpretation of the words `` including '' and `` cover '' to determine whether , as a matter of law , the claim requires that the cover and the ring are attached to each other . The specification and drawings show the restriction ring as `` part of '' and permanently attached to the cover . No other structure is illustrated or described . The specification describes the restriction ring as `` buil [ t ] ... as part of the air inlet cover , '' and does not suggest that the cover and the ring may be two distinct components to be inserted and removed separately . To the contrary , the specification describes the advantages of the unitary structure as important to the invention . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The specification shows only a structure whereby the restriction ring is `` part of '' the cover , in permanent attachment . This is not simply the preferred embodiment ; it is the only embodiment . Thus although Toro argues that it is irrelevant whether the ring and the cover are one part or two , in the specification Toro stressed that they are one : _NEWLINE_ Accordingly , building the flow restriction ring as part of the air inlet cover , on which it is needed , but leaving a similarly shaped ring off the vacuum nozzle is also advantageous in that it automatically restricts the size of air inlet depending upon which operation is being conducted without having the operator manually insert or remove a replaceable ring . _NEWLINE_ '528 patent col. 7 lines 6-12 ( citations to drawings omitted ) . The description of the invention states that the ring is inserted and removed `` automatically '' when the cover is inserted or removed . Thus when the cover is closed for operation in the blower mode , the ring that is `` attached to the inside of the air inlet cover by a plurality of screws '' is thereby put into place . It is inserted simply by closing the cover ; it is removed by opening the cover . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The specification does not describe an invention broader than this description of the cover and the restriction ring `` automatically '' inserted and removed together . Nowhere in the specification , including its twenty-one drawings , is the cover shown without the restriction ring attached to it . Nor is the restriction ring shown other than attached to the cover . The specification states that the restricting ring is automatically inserted and removed by the cover to which it is attached , and illustrates only this structure in the drawings . See 37 C.F.R . ¡± 1.83 ( a ) ( `` The drawing in a nonprovisional application must show every feature of the invention specified in the claims . `` ) ; M.P.E.P . 608.02 ( d ) ( Complete Illustration in Drawings ) . No other , broader concept was described as embodying the applicant 's invention , or shown in any of the drawings , or presented for examination . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The claim word `` including '' is not construed in a lexicographic vacuum , but in the context of the specification and drawings . E.g. , United States v. Adams , 383 U.S. 39 , 49 , 86 S.Ct . 708 , 15 L.Ed.2d 572 ( 1966 ) ( `` it is fundamental that claims are to be construed in light of the specifications and both are to be read with a view to ascertaining the invention '' ) ; Smith v. Snow , 294 U.S. 1 , 14 , 55 S.Ct . 279 , 79 L.Ed . 721 ( 1935 ) ( `` if the claim were fairly susceptible to two constructions , that should be adopted which will secure to the patentee his actual invention '' ) ; Abtox , Inc. v. Exitron Corp. , 122 F.3d 1019 , 1027 , 43 USPQ2d 1545 , 1551 ( Fed.Cir.1997 ) ( `` because the claim language , as interpreted in light of the specification , limits the microwave devices to a single gas-confining chamber , this court affirms the district court 's grant of summary judgment '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This is not a case of limiting the claims to a `` preferred embodiment '' of an invention that has been more broadly disclosed . It is well established that the preferred embodiment does not limit broader claims that are supported by the written description . E.g. , Laitram Corp. v. Cambridge Wire Cloth Co. , 863 F.2d 855 , 865 , 9 USPQ2d 1289 , 1299 ( Fed.Cir.1988 ) ( `` References *1302 to a preferred embodiment , such as those often present in a specification , are not claim limitations. '' ) . Nor is this a case of limiting claims to immaterial details of a broader invention as set forth in the specification . See , e.g. , SRI International v. Matsushita Electric Corp. , 775 F.2d 1107 , 1118 , 227 USPQ 577 , 583 ( Fed.Cir.1985 ) ( method of operation described in specification improperly read into structural claims ) . No such broader invention is here described . Instead , the invention is described throughout the specification as it is claimed , whereby the cover `` includes '' the ring , so that the ring is inserted by closing the cover and removed by opening the cover , `` automatically . '' There is no basis for construing `` including '' the ring to mean not including the ring . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Toro invokes the doctrine of claim differentiation , pointing to claim 17 which is specific to the restriction ring as `` carried by the cover , '' as supporting a broader scope for the word `` including '' in claim 16 . White responds that there is no support in the body of the specification for such broader meaning of `` including , '' and points out that claim 17 not only replaces `` including '' with `` carried by , '' but also specifies that the restriction ring is `` disposed sufficiently close to said impeller to prevent air spillover between the high pressure side and low pressure side of said impeller blades . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The doctrine of claim differentiation can shed light on the proper scope to be afforded a claim limitation , for `` [ t ] here is presumed to be a difference in meaning and scope when different words or phrases are used in separate claims . To the extent that the absence of such difference in meaning and scope would make a claim superfluous , the doctrine of claim differentiation states the presumption that the difference between claims is significant . '' Tandon Corp. v. United States Int ' l Trade Comm ' n , 831 F.2d 1017 , 1023 , 4 USPQ2d 1283 , 1288 ( Fed.Cir.1987 ) . However , the doctrine of claim differentiation does not serve to broaden claims beyond their meaning in light of the specification , see Multiform Desiccants Inc. v. Medzam Ltd. , 133 F.3d 1473 , 1480 , 45 USPQ2d 1429 , 1434 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) , and does not override clear statements of scope in the specification and the prosecution history . These documents require that clause [ 6 ] be construed to mean that the restriction ring is permanently affixed to and included as part of the cover . On this construction , the claims can not be literally infringed by a device having a separate restriction ring that is inserted and removed as a separate part . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The summary judgment of literal infringement is reversed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Doctrine of Equivalents _NEWLINE_ Toro argues that even if there is not literal infringement , there is infringement under the doctrine of equivalents . Toro states that White has merely separated into two components that which the patentee achieved with one . See , e.g. , Richardson v. Suzuki Motor Co. , 868 F.2d 1226 , 1239 , 9 USPQ2d 1913 , 1923 ( Fed.Cir.1989 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The court did not reach the question of whether the use of separate components for cover and ring would nonetheless infringe under the doctrine of equivalents . On this factual question of equivalency , material facts were in dispute . We remand for determination of this issue . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ No costs . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ REVERSED AND REMANDED _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ RADER , Circuit Judge , dissenting . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The court today determines that the verb `` include '' in the '528 patent requires an `` attachment relationship . '' However , the court 's interpretation of `` including '' can not be justified by examination of the ordinary meaning of that word or of its accepted use in patent claims , or , especially , by a careful reading of the '528 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ It is axiomatic that terms in a claim must be given their ordinary meaning unless it is apparent that the inventor used them differently in the patent . Intellicall , *1303 Inc. v. Phonometrics , Inc. , 952 F.2d 1384 , 1387 ( Fed.Cir.1992 ) . While the court acknowledges that `` [ d ] ictionaries are useful additional sources , '' it did not consult one to establish the ordinary meaning of `` include , '' a procedure suggested by Hoganas AB v. Dresser Indus. , Inc. , 9 F.3d 948 , 951 ( Fed.Cir.1993 ) . When the parties themselves consulted dictionaries , both emerged with similar definitions of `` include , '' incorporating the concept of `` take in or comprise as a whole . '' Combining this modern definition with the origin of `` include '' in the Latin Inclaudere , to shut in , confine within , or hold as in an enclosure , BLACK 'S LAW DICTIONARY , 6th ed . ( 1990 ) , leaves no doubt that the ordinary meaning of `` include '' does not require physical attachment . * _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In patent claims , `` including '' is normally a comprehensive term , used in a way similar to `` having '' or `` comprising . '' JOHN LANDIS , MECHANICS OF PATENT CLAIM DRAFTING , section 7 . In a claim element , use of the forms `` comprising , '' `` having , '' or `` including , '' commonly means that whatever element is comprised , had , or included , is not necessarily the only element encompassed by the subject of the clause that contains that verb . See Robert C. Faber , The Winning Mechanical Claim , 426 PLI/P 231 , 353 ( 1995 ) . `` Including , '' in a claim , thus signifies a relationship broader than `` attachment . '' In the invention of the '528 patent the concept of the flow restrictor , which allows the user to adjust the air flow during the blower mode of operation , is original . '528 patent , col. 2 , ll . 29-32 . Thus , the choice of the word `` including '' was appropriate to give the applicant the broad coverage sought and deserved for his original concept . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Finally , a careful reading of the '528 patent also demonstrates that `` including '' does not here require attachment . The court mistakenly takes the described embodiment to be unique , inferring that the specification teaches that embodiment alone . The court notes that `` [ t ] he specification shows only a structure whereby cover and ring are permanently attached to each other . This was not simply the preferred embodiment ; it was the only embodiment . '' On the contrary , the specification does not claim such uniqueness and describes another embodiment , specifically one in which the flow restriction ring is not permanently attached to the cover . Everywhere the word `` embodiment '' is used to denote what is described in the specification of the '528 patent , it is used in the phrase `` a preferred embodiment . '' More important , the inventor contrasts the preferred embodiment not , as the court thinks , with disadvantageous prior art , but rather with a less-preferred embodiment of the invention at hand : a blower with a replaceable , i.e. , non-attached , ring . As the inventor states , the method of construction of the preferred embodiment , in which the flow restriction ring is indeed built into , and thus `` part of , '' the air inlet cover , is advantageous in that `` it automatically restricts the size of air inlet ... without having the operator manually insert or remove a replaceable ring . '' '528 patent , col. 7 , ll.6-12 . But as noted above , there is no prior art for the flow restriction ring , so that such a ring in any form was part of the invention . In particular , an owner-replaceable ring , i.e. , one not attached , was clearly part of the invention , and is described by element [ 6 ] of claim 16 of the '528 patent . In short , an `` included '' but definitely not `` attached '' flow restriction ring is a feature of an embodiment of *1304 the invention , but not the preferred embodiment . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The term `` including , '' in the context of the '528 patent , does not imply `` attachment , '' and the claims of this patent should not be limited to the preferred embodiment with its attached restricting ring . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 199 F.3d 1295 , 53 U.S.P.Q.2d 1065 _NEWLINE_ Footnotes _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ * _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Pursuant to Fed .

'' However , the court admits that `` no special meaning in the field ... is attributed to the words ... 'included , ' [ and ] 'attachment . ' `` Nor does the court rely on any testimony by either party on the question of whether any meaning , other than the ordinary meaning , is appropriate for these words in the context of the patent _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_

No . 98-417 , 98 Stat . 1585 ( `` the Act '' ) , on appeal from the United States District Court for the District of Delaware . Pursuant to the Act , plaintiffs-appellants Senju Pharmaceutical Co. , Ltd. , Kyorin Pharmaceutical Co. , Ltd. , and Allergan , Inc. ( collectively `` Senju '' ) sued defendants-appellees Lupin Limited and Lupin Pharmaceuticals , Inc. ( collectively `` Lupin '' ) and Hi-Tech Pharmacal Co. , Inc. ( `` Hi-Tech '' ) for infringement of asserted claims 6 and 12-16 of reexamined U.S. Patent No . 6,333,045 ( `` the ¡¬045 patent '' ) . Defendants counterclaimed seeking *1339 a declaratory judgment of non-infringement and invalidity . The district court , Judge Sue L. Robinson , adjudged the claims infringed but invalid for obviousness . Plaintiffs appeal the invalidity judgment.1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I . INTRODUCTION _NEWLINE_ The invention at issue relates to gatifloxacin , an aqueous liquid pharmaceutical eye drop composition , with added disodium edetate ( `` EDTA '' ) . Seven prior art patents are alleged as the basis for the obviousness determination , each containing some of the same chemistry as the claimed invention . In addition , there are several prior patent infringement suits involving the same chemistry and the same ¡¬045 patent ; these suits are relevant , though to some extent the issues and parties vary . Three of these infringement suits , including this one , have all been tried before and decided by the same district judge in the District of Delaware . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The underlying issues in this case-constructive infringement under Hatch-Waxman , countered by alleged non-infringement and invalidity for obviousness-are familiar patent issues . Yet , the combination of the chemistry and the prior litigation has produced here a complex of arguments by both parties . We address below in detail only those arguments that we believe have saliency with regard to the outcome . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Regarding the prior law suits , the first began in 2007 . Pursuant to the Hatch-Waxman Act , a manufacturer of generic drugs , Apotex Inc. and Apotex Corp. ( `` Apotex '' ) , filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application ( `` ANDA '' ) with the Food and Drug Administration ( `` FDA '' ) , seeking to market generic versions of Allergan 's gatifloxacin product Zymar ( r ) . The patent on Zymar ( r ) was listed in the FDA 's record of Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic Equivalence , what is known as the `` Orange Book . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In this first suit , the district court in 2010 ruled that the asserted claims were infringed , but that claims 1-3 and 6-9 were invalid as obvious over the prior art . However , the court found that defendant Apotex failed to demonstrate that claims 6 and 7 were invalid for lack of enablement and failed to demonstrate inequitable conduct . Senju Pharm . Co. v. Apotex Inc. , 717 F.Supp.2d 404 , 433 ( D.Del.2010 ) ( `` Apotex 1 `` ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Following a motion for a new trial , or , alternatively , to amend judgment and findings regarding claim 7 , the court reopened the case to consider additional evidence regarding claim 7 . Thereafter , the court in 2011 found claim 7 obvious by clear and convincing evidence . Senju Pharm . Co. v. Apotex Inc. , 836 F.Supp.2d 196 , 210-11 ( D.Del.2011 ) ( `` Apotex 2 `` ) . On appeal of the judgment regarding claim 7 , this court affirmed the judgment of invalidity in a summary affirmance , Senju Pharm . Co. v. Apotex Inc. , 485 Fed.Appx . 433 ( Fed.Cir.2012 ) ( `` Apotex I `` ) ; the other parts of the district judge 's rulings were not appealed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Meanwhile , in February 2011 , before final judgment was entered in that litigation , the Senju plaintiffs petitioned the Patent and Trademark Office ( `` PTO '' ) for ex-parte re-examination of the ¡¬045 patent . Plaintiffs submitted the prior art , the arguments relied upon by the court and parties , and the court 's opinion . However , plaintiffs did not notify either the defendants or the court that they were seeking re-examination ; it was not until shortly *1340 before the re-examination was completed that the trial court was informed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On initial reexamination , the PTO agreed with the district court that the original claims would have been obvious in light of the cited prior art patents . Subsequently , in October 2011 , the PTO issued a reexamination certificate for the ¡¬045 patent which cancelled claims 1-3 and 8-11 , allowed amended claim 6 , and added claims 1216 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Then plaintiff Senju filed another suit against Apotex , alleging infringement of the reexamined claims and seeking a declaratory judgment of infringement based on the same ANDA filing at issue in the first litigation . Apotex responded to the new action by seeking dismissal on the grounds of res judicata , or claim preclusion ( `` claim '' here referring to the civil procedure concept , not the patent law meaning ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Ultimately the district court sided with Apotex and gave judgment against Senju on the grounds of claim preclusion : `` the reexamination of the patent-at-issue did not create a new cause of action against the same previous defendants and accused product . '' Senju Pharm . Co. v. Apotex Inc. , 891 F.Supp.2d 656 , 662 ( D.Del.2012 ) ( `` Apotex 3 `` ) . On appeal , this judgment was upheld in an extensive opinion by the Federal Circuit , Senju Pharm . Co. v. Apotex Inc. , 746 F.3d 1344 ( Fed.Cir.2014 ) ( `` Apotex II `` ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ While all this was going on , Senju , in 2011 , filed the suit at issue here against the Lupin and Hi-Tech defendants , asserting infringement under the Hatch-Waxman Act of the ¡¬045 patent.2 As in the second suit against Apotex , Senju specifically alleged infringement of the reexamined claims 6 and 12-16 , this time based on Lupin 's earlier-filed ANDA Nos . 202-653 , 0.5 w/v % gatifloxacin and 202-709 , 0.3 w/v % gatifloxacin , as well as Hi-Tech 's ANDA Nos . 203189 , 0.5 w/v % gatifloxacin and 203190 , 0.3 w/v % gatifloxacin . The Lupin and Hi-Tech defendants had sought FDA approval to market and sell generic copies of Senju 's FDA approved gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Lupin moved for judgment on the pleadings , alleging that the narrower reexamined claims of the ¡¬045 patent were invalid for obviousness , and that plaintiffs should be collaterally estopped from relitigating these claims based on the court 's findings in Apotex 3 . The district court ruled that , although Lupin might later at trial succeed in showing that the reexamined claims were invalid for obviousness , Senju in the Apotex 1 & 2 litigations had not fully litigated a claim with a limitation of 0.01 w/v % EDTA and , therefore , collateral estoppel would not apply.3 J.A . 7 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As noted earlier , the ¡¬045 patent is directed to aqueous liquid pharmaceutical compositions comprising gatifloxacin and EDTA , as well as various methods utilizing these compositions . The ¡¬045 patent 's original U.S. filing date is April 21 , 2000 . The reexamined claims at issue are : _NEWLINE_ 6 . A method for raising corneal permeability of an aqueous pharmaceutical Gatifloxacin eye drop solution comprising Gatifloxacin or its salt , having a pH of from above 5 to about 6 containing from about 0.3 to about 0.8 w/v % Gatifloxacin or its salt , which comprises incorporating *1341 about 0.01 w/v % disodium edetate into said Gatifloxacin eye drop solution . _NEWLINE_ 12 . An aqueous liquid pharmaceutical eye drop composition which comprises from about 0.3 to about 0.8 w/v % Gatifloxacin or its salt , about 0.01 w/v % disodium edetate , and wherein the aqueous liquid pharmaceutical composition has a pH of from about 5 to about 6 . _NEWLINE_ 13 . The aqueous liquid pharmaceutical eye drop composition according to claim 12 , comprising about 0.3 w/v % Gatifloxacin or its salt . _NEWLINE_ 14 . The aqueous liquid pharmaceutical eye drop composition according to claim 12 , comprising about 0.5 w/v % Gatifloxacin or its salt . _NEWLINE_ 15 . The aqueous liquid pharmaceutical eye drop composition according to claim 12 , comprising at least one isotonic agent selected from the group consisting of sodium chloride , potassium chloride , glycerin , mannitol and glucose . _NEWLINE_ 16 . The aqueous liquid pharmaceutical eye drop composition according to claim 14 , wherein the at least one isotonic agent is sodium chloride . _NEWLINE_ ¡¬045 patent Reexamination Certificate , 1:25-2:24 ; J.A . 2702 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court , having reserved the question of infringement and the validity of the reexamined claims in light of the prior art of record , proceeded to trial . The court 's ultimate judgment was that the reexamined claims were infringed , but were invalid for obviousness . Thus , the question before us is in this appeal is whether the district court erred when , in the current suit against Lupin and Hi-Tech , it concluded that reexamined claims 6 and 12-16 of the ¡¬045 patent were invalid for obviousness . We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C . ¡±¡± 1292 ( c ) ( 2 ) and 1295 ( a ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ II . DISCUSSION _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A . Standard of Review _NEWLINE_ Obviousness is a question of law that we review without deference . Pozen Inc. v. Par Pharm. , Inc. , 696 F.3d 1151 , 1160 ( Fed.Cir.2012 ) . Following a bench trial , we review underlying factual determinations for clear error . Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ An obviousness inquiry assesses `` the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art '' to ascertain whether `` the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains . '' 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 ( a ) ( 1994 ) . `` [ A ] patent composed of several elements is not proved obvious merely by demonstrating that each of its elements was , independently , known in the prior art .

Thus , a defendant asserting obviousness in view of a combination of references has the burden to show by clear and convincing evidence that a person of ordinary skill in the relevant field had reason to combine the elements in the manner claimed . Id . at 418-19 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 .

Analysis _NEWLINE_ The Senju appellants make two main arguments relating to obviousness : ( 1 ) the district court erred by finding that the prior art taught using 0.01 w/v % EDTA in an ophthalmic formulation would work to increase corneal permeability ; and ( 2 ) the *1342 district court erred by finding appellants ' proffer of evidence of unexpected results unavailing . We will consider each of these arguments in turn . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 . Obviousness _NEWLINE_ Before addressing the substantive obviousness analysis conducted by the district court , we address Senju 's arguments regarding the methodology the district court used in its analysis . First , appellants argue that the district court improperly utilized its obviousness findings from its decision in Apotex 1 as the basis from which to begin its invalidity inquiries in this case , essentially lessening appellees ' burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the reexamined claims asserted in the present case would have been obvious . Appellants argue that the district court 's factual findings in Apotex 1 should have played no role in the invalidity inquiry in this case because the currently asserted reexamined claims contain new limitations and disclose only a narrow subset of the original claimed invention , commensurate with objective evidence of unexpected results . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Appellants argue that the district court relied upon findings from Apotex 1 regarding EDTA concentrations and pH range to conclude that the new limitations in the reexamined claims do not distinguish the claimed inventions from the prior art . They argue that the court analyzed the claims in piecemeal fashion , violating the requirement in section 103 of the Patent Act that courts analyze the obviousness of an invention `` as a whole . '' See 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 ( a ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Appellants argue that the district court by this method of analysis effectively applied a presumption of invalidity to the reexamined claims , resulting in the district court 's failure to evaluate the limitations holistically . In effect , appellants argue , the district court used the predecessor claims as prior art to the present claims even though such methodology is erroneous as a matter of law . Appellant Br . 63-64 ( citing Interconnect Planning Corp. v. Feil , 774 F.2d 1132 , 1137 ( Fed.Cir.1985 ) ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Appellees respond that appellants ' pursuit of reexamined claims 6 and 12-16 was merely a failed attempt to bypass the district court 's Apotex 1 invalidity judgment and prior art teachings and that appellants can not now claim the district court 's methodology is the reason for their failings . Appellees argue that the district court did not err by declining to repeat the identical reasoning for identical factual findings that appellants never appealed in Apotex 1 . Appellees note that appellants ' singular focus at trial was the 0.01 w/v % EDTA for corneal permeability and that appellants never raised the arguments rejected in Apotex 1 , or new arguments outside this issue . Thus , appellees argue , the district court properly declined to `` find '' anew facts appellants did not dispute at trial or those already found and not appealed in Apotex 1 because such facts are undisputed . Nevertheless , appellees point out that the district court properly made new fact findings specific to the reexamined claims as a whole , even beyond the 0.01 w/v % EDTA issue appellants pursued at trial , repeating a complete obviousness analysis for each claim appellants asserted , and supporting all of its findings with evidence of record from this case . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In support of their position that the district court used the predecessor claims as prior art to the present claims and failed to analyze the reexamined claims holistically , appellants cite Interconnect Planning Corp. , 774 F.2d 1132 . In Interconnect , we held that the district court improperly weighed the changes in the reissue claim against the original claim and failed to consider the differences between *1343 the prior art and the reissue claim as a whole . Id . at 1137 . This case is distinguishable from the present case . Contrary to appellants ' characterization , the district court in the present case did not handpick limitations in the reexamined claims to analyze . Instead , the district court focused on appellants ' own arguments , which highlighted key claim limitations that distinguished the reexamined claims from the prior art generally . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We conclude that the district court properly considered as a whole all of the limitations in appellants ' amended and newly-added claims , including `` using 0.3 w/v % to 0.8 w/v % gatifloxacin ; '' a `` pH of above 5 to about 6 ; '' and `` using 0.01 w/v % EDTA , '' including `` to increase corneal permeability '' in the context of the prior art . Specifically , the district court stepped through the disputed claim limitations and pointed out where each is found in the prior art , along with the reasoning for combining the prior art to reach the disclosure in the asserted claims . See , e.g. , J.A . 25-34 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Moving on to the conclusion of obviousness by the district court , we address first the obviousness of claims 1216 , the composition claims , and then the obviousness of claim 6 , a method claim . The four prior art references from the Apotex 1 & 2 cases , U.S. Patent Nos . 4,551,456 ( `` the ¡¬456 patent '' ) , 4,780,465 ( `` the ¡¬465 patent '' ) , and 4,980,470 ( `` the ¡¬470 patent '' ) , and Grass 19854 , are again at issue in this case . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The earliest of the prior art patents , the ¡¬456 patent , issued on November 5 , 1985 , teaches that then-known quinolones are both `` compatible with ocular tissue '' and useful in treating bacterial ocular infections through topical administration . ¡¬456 patent , 1:13-17 . The ¡¬456 patent also discloses an exemplary ophthalmic composition that comprises an aqueous solution of 0.3 w/v % norfloxacin and 0.01 w/v % EDTA , as well as the use of EDTA as one of 8 conventional excipients . Id . at 2:5-10 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The ¡¬465 patent , issued on October 25 , 1988 , discloses aqueous compositions for the quinolone lomefloxacin , also characterizing EDTA as a conventional excipient . ¡¬465 patent , 2:31-46 . The ¡¬465 patent describes two exemplary ophthalmic compositions , similar to the ophthalmic composition disclosed by the ¡¬456 patent , containing 0.3 w/v % lomefloxacin and 0.01 w/v % EDTA . Id . at 4:1-23 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The ¡¬470 patent , issued on December 25 , 1990 , teaches that gatifloxacin represents an improvement over the prior art quinolones in that it exhibits a broader antibacterial activity , higher selective toxicity and safe oral and parenteral administration . ¡¬470 patent , 1:32-61 . The ¡¬470 patent also teaches that each of the disclosed quinolones have `` similar substituents , '' id . at 1:41-43 , and that pharmaceutical formulations of gatifloxacin follow `` the routes well known '' with respect to `` oral [ ] and parenteral [ ] '' administration , including `` liquids [ and ] eye drops . '' Id . at 7:21-26 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Grass 1985 reference is directed to the study of EDTA 's impact on the permeability of organic and inorganic compounds with respect to the corneal epithelia . J.A . 2707 . Grass 1985 teaches that EDTA can reduce the number of calcium ions through chelation , thus creating small channels between corneal epithelial cells , which allow polar molecules to penetrate through the cornea into the aqueous humor of the eye . Grass 1985 specifically reports that the addition of 0.5 w/v % EDTA to separate solutions of glycerol and cromolyn resulted in increased corneal permeability in both solutions . A lower unspecified concentration *1344 of EDTA was also shown to function in this manner , albeit to a lesser extent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In addition to these four references , appellees also raise the Grass 1988-I5 , Grass 1988-II6 , and Rojanasakul7 references , mainly to address the additional claim limitations in the narrower , reexamined claims . The Grass 1988-I and Grass 1988-II references build on the work in Grass 1985 ( collectively , `` Grass references '' ) , testing lower concentrations of 0.1 , 0.05 , and 0.01 w/v % EDTA , finding increased corneal permeability at these lower concentrations . The Rojanasakul reference is directed to studying the promoting mechanisms of various penetration enhancers , including EDTA , in the cornea , as well as to developing methods for evaluating tissue damage and viability . J.A . 2788 . This reference builds further on the teachings of the Grass references by testing EDTA concentrations as low as 0.00037 w/v % EDTA , and finding that even these very low concentrations increased corneal permeability to some degree . J.A . 2795-96 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Appellants also raise two additional references , the Mitra reference and the Kompella reference , as evidence of nonobviousness . The Mitra reference is a comprehensive review of ophthalmic drug delivery systems . J.A . 2768-72 . The Mitra reference specifically studies the mechanisms of EDTA for corneal drug penetration examining the concentrations at which increases in permeability of the cornea occur . J.A . 2772 . The Kompella reference is a peer-reviewed abstract that reinforces the teachings of Mitra , studying the impact of EDTA on corneal permeability . J.A . 2810-11 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ First , appellants argue that the seven prior art references relied upon by the district court predate the claimed invention by at least eight years , which , `` is itself evidence of nonobviousness . '' Appellant Br . 25 ( citing Panduit Corp. v. Dennison Mfg . Co. , 810 F.2d 1561 , 1577 ( Fed.Cir.1987 ) ) . Second , appellants argue that the district court misconstrued the teachings of the prior art . Specifically , with respect to claims 12-16 , appellants argue that a skilled artisan would not have been motivated to cherry-pick individual limitations from the ¡¬456 , ¡¬465 , and ¡¬470 patents and combine them to achieve the compositions of claims 12-16 . Appellants argue that the district court erred in selectively excerpting teachings from these three prior art references to reverse-engineer the claimed invention . In its analysis , appellants argue , the district court failed to consider whether an ordinary practitioner would have had a reason to make the multiple selections , combinations , and modifications needed under its analysis to arrive at the claimed compositions . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Appellants also argue that the district court improperly declined to consider evidence on corneal permeability with reference to the composition claims . Appellants point out that corneal permeability is relevant to these claims because the claimed compositions embody the method *1345 of reexamined claim 6 and the purpose of the composition and the functions of its limitations can not be divorced from the obviousness inquiry . Appellant Reply Br . 19 ( citing Leo Pharmaceutical Products , Ltd. v. Rea , 726 F.3d 1346 , 1353 , 1356 ( Fed.Cir.2013 ) ) . Because , according to appellants , no prior art disclosed 0.01 w/v % EDTA as preferred for the purpose of raising corneal permeability , appellants argue that they did more than merely seek to patent a combination of known ingredients to achieve established functions . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Appellants argue that the district court improperly found claims 12-16 obvious without finding that the ¡¬456 , ¡¬465 , and ¡¬470 patents actually teach any gatifloxacin formulations for ocular administration . Appellants argue that the district court improperly surmised that the ¡¬456 patent teaches that quinolones are useful in treating bacterial infections , the ¡¬465 patent teaches that EDTA is a conventional excipient for use with the quinolone lomefloxacin , and the ¡¬470 patent teaches that gatifloxacin formulations can be used in known routes of oral and parenteral administration , including liquid eye drops . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Based on these conclusions , appellants argue that the district court then improperly relied on the fact that gatifloxacin is a member of the quinolone family of compounds to combine the ¡¬456 and ¡¬470 patents and arrive at the idea of an ophthalmic gatifloxacin solution , pulling teachings of gatifloxacin concentrations and pH from the ¡¬456 and ¡¬465 patents and 0.01 w/v % EDTA from the ¡¬456 patent to arrive at the specific ranges recited in the claims . Essentially , appellants argue that the district court selectively excerpted teachings from each of the three prior art patents to improperly reverse-engineer the claimed invention . Appellants point out that this is improper hindsight bias because the ¡¬456 , ¡¬465 , and ¡¬470 patents themselves do not disclose anything about corneal permeability of gatifloxacin solutions and , therefore , provide no reason to arrive at the claimed compositions . Appellants argue that the district court failed to identify any reasons for a skilled artisan to combine the prior art to achieve the claimed invention , finding only that a skilled artisan would have been motivated to use gatifloxacin and EDTA together and that the claimed pH and EDTA concentration limitations are found in the prior art . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Appellees respond that , with respect to claims 12-16 , not only did appellants waive the issue of the years between the publication of the prior art and the filing date of the ¡¬045 patent application being `` itself evidence of nonobviousness '' by raising this issue for the first time on appeal , but also that the Panduit case appellants cite in support of their position is not comparable to the current case . Appellees point out that in the Panduit case , there were no prior art references at issue that disclosed or suggested all of the claimed structural limitations , while in this case several prior art references do just that . Appellee Br . 38 ( citing Panduit , 810 F.2d at 1577 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ With respect to appellants ' main obviousness arguments , appellees point out that because the composition claims do not contain the corneal permeability limitation found in method claim 6 , the corneal permeability teaching away arguments are irrelevant to claims 12-16 . Appellees argue that the only composition element appellants deemed missing from the ¡¬456 and ¡¬465 quinolone ophthalmic formulation patents was an express mention of gatifloxacin for improving corneal permeability of any drug . Appellees argue , however , that when combined with the ¡¬470 patent , this limitation of the claims is obvious . Additionally , appellees argue there was sufficient reason to combine the claims in these *1346 three patents to render the asserted claims obvious . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Appellees characterize the ¡¬456 patent as teaching using norfloxacin and structurally related antibodies in topical ocular formulations , while the ¡¬ 465 patent taught preparing stable ophthalmic fluoroquinolone compositions , with both patents containing ingredient ranges encompassing those claimed . Both the ¡¬456 and ¡¬465 patents also taught topical ocular formulations containing various features encompassed by the composition claims , such as 0.01 w/v % EDTA and 5.2 pH . Because the art viewed gatifloxacin as an improved fluoroquinolone , appellees argue that one of ordinary skill in the art would have had reason to combine the ¡¬470 patent 's gatifloxacin disclosure to improve the ¡¬456 and ¡¬465 patents ' formulations . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Appellees also argue that these disclosures combined with appellants failure to dispute that the art viewed gatifloxacin as an improved fluoroquinolone , provides the reason why one of ordinary skill would want to improve the ¡¬456 and ¡¬465 patents by incorporating the ¡¬470 patent 's gatifloxacin . Appellees point out that the ¡¬470 patent 's gatifloxacin eye drop teaching is directed to the same drug class as the ¡¬456 and ¡¬465 patents and provides evidence that gatifloxacin should work in the ¡¬456 patent 's formulation . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ With respect to claims 12-16 , we conclude that the district court properly held these claims obvious . Appellants ' argument relating to the eight year gap between the prior art and the filing of the ¡¬045 patent application is unconvincing and not properly raised . Appellants only show of support for this issue being raised prior to this appeal is a single citation to the district court opinion in which appellants argue , in a footnote , that the district court `` acknowledged the vintage of the prior art , '' citing to portions of the district court opinion that merely recite the years in which the prior art was published . Appellant Br . 19 n. 4 ( citing J.A . 10-14 ) . This is insufficient discussion to consider this argument raised at the district court , and this argument is , therefore , waived . See Sage Prods. , Inc. v. Devon Indus. , Inc. , 126 F.3d 1420 , 1426 ( Fed.Cir.1997 ) ( finding that `` [ w ] ith few notable exceptions ... appellate courts do not consider a party 's new theories , lodged first on appeal '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ For the purpose of claims 12-16 , the main focus of appellants ' appeal brief was on the inclusion of the corneal permeability limitation in the analysis of the validity of these claims . We conclude that the district court properly found that corneal permeability is not relevant in the discussion of composition claims 12-16 because these claims do not contain the corneal permeability limitation found in method claim 6 , discussed below . J.A . 24 n. 25 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We do not find persuasive appellants ' argument that it is necessary to consider corneal permeability when analyzing claims 12-16 because the claimed compositions embody the method of reexamined claim 6 . The Leo Pharmaceutical Products , Ltd. v. Rea , 726 F.3d 1346 , 1349-50 ( Fed.Cir.2013 ) , case appellants cite in support of their argument examines a composition claim that includes as a limitation the function of the composition . In composition claims 12-16 of the ¡¬045 patent , there is no limitation denoting the function of the composition and we decline to import this limitation into the claims . See Phillips v. AWH Corp. , 415 F.3d 1303 , 1323 ( Fed.Cir.2005 ) ( stating that we have repeatedly warned against confining the claims to particular embodiments in the written description ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Further , there were several other factors in Leo Pharmaceutical that led the court to conclude that the claims were nonobvious , including a lack of reasons for *1347 one of ordinary skill in the art to combine the asserted prior art references . Leo Pharm. , 726 F.3d at 1354 . In the present case , there were sufficient reasons to improve upon the ¡¬456 and ¡¬465 patents by utilizing gatifloxacin , as disclosed in the ¡¬470 patent , and described fully below . All three of these patents relate to quinolones and their derivatives for use as antibacterial agents , and we conclude that the district court properly determined that combining them would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The ¡¬045 and ¡¬456 patents disclose ophthalmic quinolone compositions in topical ocular formulations , which gave reasons to one of ordinary skill in the art to combine with the gatifloxacin disclosure of the ¡¬470 patent because gatifloxacin was recognized in the art as an improved fluoroquinolone . Appellants never disputed that the art viewed gatifloxacin as an improved fluoroquinolone . Thus , it would have been obvious to improve the ¡¬ 456 and ¡¬465 patent formulations by incorporating the ¡¬470 pa-tent 's gatifloxacin . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Many of appellants ' arguments on the lack of reasons to combine the teachings of these three patents rely on the fact that they do not disclose anything about corneal permeability of gatifloxacin solutions . As discussed above , this is not a limitation of claims 12-16 and , therefore , is not relevant to the obviousness determination . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Lastly , the use of gatifloxacin with EDTA would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art . EDTA is listed among eight `` conventional ingredients '' in the ¡¬456 patent and a similar group of excipients . ¡¬456 patent , 2:1-16 ; ¡¬456 patent , 2:36-49 . Further , the use of 0.3 to 0.8 w/v % of gatifloxacin is outlined in the prior art , such as in the ¡¬456 patent , 1:37-43 ( `` from about 0.03 to 3 % '' ) , and in the ¡¬465 patent , 2:22-25 ( `` preferably about 0.3 % to 5 % w/v '' ) . As the district court pointed out the use of 0.01 w/v % EDTA was also known from the ¡¬456 patent , which discloses an exemplary formulation of 0.3 % quinolone solution that incorporates 0.01 w/v % EDTA , and teaches using `` from about 0.03 to 3 % and especially 0.15 % to 0.6 % of medicament although higher or lower dosages can be employed . '' ¡¬456 patent at 1:37-40 , 4:1-23 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Based on the foregoing , we conclude that the district court properly held that claims 12-16 were invalid as obvious . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Next , we analyze whether method claim 6 would have been obvious . In general , appellants argue that the district court improperly found that all of the features of claim 6 of the ¡¬045 patent are disclosed in the prior art , and that appellees failed to prove invalidity of claim 6 by clear and convincing evidence . Specifically , appellants argue that nothing in the prior art reasonably suggested that the claimed limitations of 0.01 w/v % EDTA at pH 5-6 would have any effect in improving gatifloxacin 's corneal permeability in vivo . In fact , appellants argue , the prior art expressly taught that these claimed limitations would have no effect on corneal permeability . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Appellants argue that several prior art references which teach away from the claimed invention , including the Mitra and Kompella references , are notably absent from the district court 's invalidity analysis . Appellants argue that the district court 's boilerplate language stating that it had `` considered the documentary evidence and testimony '' is insufficient to discharge the challenger 's burden of proving obviousness . Appellant Reply Br . 3 ( citing In re Cyclobenzaprine Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsule Patent Litig. , 676 F.3d 1063 , 1075 , 1077 ( Fed.Cir.2012 ) ) . Appellants argue that , by addressing only those references that , in the view of the district court , pointed towards obviousness , the *1348 district court failed to weigh all of the evidence on both sides of the question of invalidity . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Appellants argue that the prior art taught the use of high EDTA concentrations to increase corneal permeability , not the use of low EDTA concentrations , such as those disclosed in the ¡¬045 patent . For example , appellants argue that in the Kompella reference , researchers used EDTA at a concentration of 0.5 w/v % , fifty times that of the ¡¬045 patent , to increase corneal permeability of several beta-blockers , while also teaching that increasing pH to 8.4-well above the claimed pH range of 5-6-improved corneal permeability . Appellants further argue that the Mitra reference expressly discouraged seeking to improve corneal permeability using the claimed EDTA concentration in vivo , reporting that such concentrations are `` devoid of any effects '' in in vitro experiments . Thus , appellants argue , both Mitra and Kompella suggest a line of development pointing towards higher EDTA concentrations and higher pH levels to increase corneal permeability-and thus away from the claimed invention . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Appellants also argue that the Grass references do not render claim 6 obvious . Specifically , appellants argue that Grass 1985 did not study the corneal permeability of gatifloxacin or any quinolone , nor did it employ concentrations and conditions resembling those specified in the reexamined claims . Further , appellants argue that Grass 1988-I explicitly reported that 0.01 w/v % EDTA has `` 0 '' effect on corneal permeability in vitro , reporting the results for 0.01 w/v % EDTA statistically indistinguishable from zero . Appellants argue that the district court improperly focused on the Grass 1988-I raw data to find increased permeability even though the percentage change was reported as zero . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Appellants further argue that the district court 's reliance on the Rojanasakul reference was misplaced . Appellants point out that Rojanasakul did not measure the passage of any molecule through the corneal membrane , rather , Rojanasakul measured changes in the electrical resistance of corneal tissue , using electrical resistance as a general proxy for membrane permeability of ions . According to appellants , appellees did not deny that Rojanasakul did not measure the corneal permeability of any molecule , relying only on attorney argument to support its position that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have expected electrical resistance to correlate with the corneal transport of gatifloxacin based on Rojanasakul . Further , appellants argue that the district court misconstrued Rojanasakul , which uses `` permeability '' to refer not only to the permeability of the corneal membrane comprising the surface of the eye , but also to permeability of the plasma membrane surrounding individual cells . Thus , the increase in permeability disclosed in Rojanasakul is not applicable to the asserted claims . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Appellants argue that because none of the ¡¬456 , ¡¬465 , and ¡¬470 patents even mention corneal permeability , these prior art patents would not have provided a reason for a skilled artisan to seek improved corneal permeability using low EDTA concentrations . Appellants argue that if it was as simple as incorporating gatifloxacin into existing formulations , as appellees contend , this invention would have likely been achieved within months as opposed to the eight years that passed before anyone conceived the claimed compositions . Appellants argue that the inclusion of EDTA among the possible excipients mentioned in the ¡¬456 and ¡¬465 patents does not render its eventual use in raising corneal permeability of gatifloxacin unpatentable , because the asserted claims , at a minimum , *1349 present a new way of using an existing drug . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Lastly , appellants argue that the prior art taught the use of higher pH , not lower pH , to improve corneal permeability . Appellants argue that the prior art uniformly taught using pH levels higher than the claimed range of 5-6 , citing Grass 1985 ( pH 7.4 ) , Grass 1988-I ( pH 7.4-7.6 ) , Grass 1988-II ( pH 7.4 ) , Kompella ( pH 8.4 ) , and Rojanasakul ( pH 7.4 ) . Appellants point out that the only evidence appellees have of a change in permeability is a decrease in permeability when lowering the pH , not an increase in permeability with a decrease in pH as claimed in the patent . Thus , appellants argue that the evidence confirms the surprising nature of the inventors ' discovery that 0.01 % w/v % EDTA formulations significantly increase gatifloxacin concentrations in the aqueous humor , even at relatively low pH levels . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Appellees respond that appellants ' experts offered no opinions defending the non-obviousness of the claim elements relating to pH , gatifloxacin percentages , use of isotonic agents , or the combination thereof in an ophthalmic formulation . Instead , appellees argue , appellants ' expert opined solely upon the question of whether one of ordinary skill would expect 0.01 w/v % EDTA to work to increase corneal permeability . Thus the district court correctly found that all of the features of the asserted claims of the ¡¬045 patent are disclosed in the prior art . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Appellees argue that the district court was not obligated to cite the Kompella and Mitra references in its opinion . Appellee Br . 45 ( citing MySpace , Inc. v. GraphOn Corp. , 672 F.3d 1250 , 1263-64 ( Fed.Cir.2012 ) ; Plant Genetic Sys. , N.V. v. DeKalb Genetics Corp. , 315 F.3d 1335 , 1343 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) ) . Appellees point out that the district court explained that it considered the documentary evidence and testimony , along with the parties ' post-trial briefing , which discussed both of these references . Thus , appellees argue , the references were presumptively considered . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Further , appellees argue that neither the Kompella or Mitra references teach away from the claimed invention . According to appellees , the Kompella reference says nothing derogatory about 0.01 w/v % EDTA or lower pH ranges , never even testing or commenting on 0.01 w/v % EDTA formulations . Appellees also argue that the Mitra reference nowhere discourages investigation or dissuades the development of 0.01 w/v % EDTA formulations for polar drugs , such as gatifloxacin , which has an ability to readily ionize and contains several polar moieties . J.A . 10 . In fact , appellees argue , appellants mischaracterize the disclosure in Mitra that 0.2 and 5 mM EDTA doses are devoid of any effects , omitting the important fact that the numbers for these tests were with a different compound , even without EDTA , that had no transport across the membranes . Appellees argue that Mitra supports Grass 's teachings that a range of EDTA levels increased corneal permeability , recognizing that an EDTA drug combination deserves some consideration in improving the bioavailability of poorly penetrating drugs . Appellee Br . 16 ( citing J.A . 2772 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Appellees add that Grass 1985 taught the broad effect of EDTA 's corneal permeability-increasing properties , recognizing that since `` chelating agents are added routinely to ophthalmic medications for stability purposes , '' the results of the Grass tests would have a `` direct bearing upon ophthalmic solutions currently in use '' even though such solutions used EDTA amounts `` at lower concentrations . '' Appellee Br . 10-11 ( citing J.A . 2707 , 2709-10 ) . Appellees also argue that appellants mischaracterize the Grass 1988-I and Grass 1988-II references as establishing a 0.01 *1350 w/v % threshold where EDTA 's effect on corneal permeability was zero . Instead , as Lupin 's expert explained , it is appellees position that the art showed the skilled person that `` EDTA works at exceedingly low concentrations '' and did not `` magically start '' at a specific number . Appellee Br . 12-13 ( citing J.A . 1695 ) . Appellees further point out that there is no support for appellants ' argument that the `` 0 '' assigned to the 0.01 w/v % EDTA numbers in Table XIII of Grass 1988-I means that the measured result is unreliable . Instead , appellees argue , this `` 0 '' simply signifies that the data did not reach statistical significance , even though one of ordinary skill reading Grass 1988-I observed raw data confirming an actual measured increase of corneal permeability , even at 0.01 w/v % EDTA levels . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As characterized by appellees , Senju 's arguments with respect to Rojanasakul include a variety of uncited attorney characterizations about the reference 's teachings that no trial witness offered . Appellees point to Rojanasakul 's teaching that changes in electrical resistance and capacitance correlate well with changes in the aqueous intercellular space and membrane surface integrity , respectively , to support the relevance of Rojanasakul 's finding that electrical resistance changed after being exposed to EDTA levels as low as 0.00037 w/v % . Because appellants admit that intercellular space is the space between cells through which gatifloxacin travels , appellees argue that a person of ordinary skill in the art could reasonably conclude that even very low EDTA levels would impact the cellular junctions , thereby promoting transport of gatifloxacin . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ With respect to claim 6 , we conclude that the district court properly held this claim invalid as obvious in light of the ¡¬456 , ¡¬465 , and ¡¬470 patents , along with the Grass 1985 , Grass 1988-I , Grass 1988-II , and Rojanasakul references.8 We find that the district court applied correct legal standards , accepting that the ¡¬045 patent was entitled to a presumption of validity ; that appellees had to establish the underlying factual proofs of obviousness by clear and convincing evidence ; and that the court properly considered all of the relevant evidence . See Sciele Pharma Inc. v. Lupin Ltd. , 684 F.3d 1253 , 1260 ( Fed.Cir.2012 ) ( `` Whether a reference was previously considered by the PTO , the burden is the same : clear and convincing evidence of invalidity. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Though the district court did not specifically cite to Kompella and Mitra in its opinion , this is not fatal because neither the Mitra nor the Kompella reference actually teach away from utilizing a lower EDTA concentration at the claimed pH level . While both references find success at higher EDTA concentrations , they do not provide any indication that lower EDTA concentrations would not also work . See J.A . 2811 , 2772 . Because the district court was not required to directly address these references and the references do not provide evidence of teaching away from the ¡¬045 patent disclosure , the district court did not commit clear error in its analysis . See MySpace , Inc. , 672 F.3d at 1263 ( finding that `` [ w ] here the record adequately supports the judgment , the district court does not have an obligation to recite every detail of its reasoning '' ) ( citing Lexion Med. , LLC v. Northgate Techs. , Inc. , 641 F.3d 1352 , 1359 ( Fed.Cir.2011 ) ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1351 Appellants focus on the use of 0.01 w/v % EDTA to increase corneal permeability as the distinguishing feature of claim 6 . However , this feature does not sufficiently distinguish claim 6 from the prior art . The asserted references demonstrate that one of ordinary skill in the art would have known that using 0.01 w/v % EDTA would result in an increase in corneal permeability . Specifically , we look to Grass 1985 , which suggests that EDTA concentrations lower than 0.5 w/v % would be effective in view of the increased corneal permeability of the 0.5 w/v % EDTA formulation to which calcium was added . J.A . 2710 . This disclosure in Grass 1985 would lead one of ordinary skill to apply this teaching in conjunction with the pre-existing quinolone formulations , which incorporated between 0.05 and 0.1 w/v % EDTA , in arriving at a gatifloxacin formulation characterized by increased corneal permeability . See , e.g. , J.A . 2712-13 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Contrary to appellants ' arguments that the prior art teaches that the use of 0.01 w/v % EDTA fails to increase corneal permeability of either of the polar compounds tested , the prior art actually teaches that adding EDTA to any polar compound will increase corneal permeability dose-dependently . For example , after experimenting with higher concentrations , Grass 1988-I tested 0.1 , 0.05 , and 0.01 w/v % EDTA , finding that each concentration raised corneal permeability , even though not all of the increases were statistically significant . J.A . 2780 . Appellants improperly focus on the percentage change in permeability over the control , which was zero for both methanol and glycerol , to conclude that the data showed no increase in corneal permeability . In reality , though the percent changes were not statistically significant , appellees set forth expert testimony that a person of ordinary skill would have recognized from the data that 0.01 w/v % EDTA would increase corneal permeability . J.A . 1695 . This testimony is consistent with other prior art , such as Rojanasakul , which confirmed a dose dependent relationship between EDTA concentration and corneal permeability , testing concentrations of EDTA as low as 0.00037 w/v % . J.A . 2795-96 . Thus , the prior art suggests that the use of concentrations as low as 0.01 w/v % EDTA would be effective to increase corneal permeability . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ At bottom , the district court 's analysis rests largely on a determination that Lupin 's experts were more credible than Senju 's experts . J.A . 30-31 . Based on this determination , the district court found that Grass 1988-I , along with the other cited references , taught that 0.01 w/v % EDTA would be effective to increase corneal permeability . J.A . 31 . On the evidence before us , that determination by the district court falls well within the wide discretion the court has to weigh expert credibility . Ordinarily , and absent compelling reason otherwise , an appellate court defers to such credibility determinations . See Celsis In Vitro , Inc. v. CellzDirect , Inc. , 664 F.3d 922 , 929 ( Fed.Cir.2012 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 2 . Unexpected Results _NEWLINE_ Appellants argue that the district court engaged in an improper post hoc analysis of appellants ' evidence of unexpected results , concluding that the claims were obvious before fully considering evidence of unexpected results and without making any finding of the results a skilled artisan would have expected . Appellants point out that a complete administrative record-including the Senju studies and the Grass 1985 and Grass 1988-I references-was before the PTO at the reexamination and that the examiners ' decision to grant the amended and new claims `` 'carries with it a presumption that [ each ] Examiner did his duty and knew what claims he *1352 was allowing . ' `` Appellant Br . 53 ( citing Al-Site Corp. v. VSI Int ' l , Inc. , 174 F.3d 1308 , 1323 ( Fed.Cir.1999 ) ( quoting Intervet Am. , Inc. v. Kee-Vet Labs. , Inc. , 887 F.2d 1050 , 1054 ( Fed.Cir.1989 ) ) ) . Thus , appellants argue , the district court erred in failing to give weight to the PTO 's factual findings on validity and unexpected results . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Appellants argue that two pre-litigation studies conducted by Senju in 2006 ( the `` ¡¬901 study '' and the `` ¡¬904 study '' ) measured and compared corneal concentrations of gatifloxacin after administering the compound in solutions with and without EDTA , demonstrating the expected and surprising benefits of the claimed invention . Appellants expound that these studies provide undisputed results demonstrating that the addition of 0.01 % w/v % EDTA results in a 27-40 % increase in gatifloxacin in the aqueous humor . The Grass 1988-I reference , appellants argue , reported a zero percent change in permeability of glycerol upon addition of 0.01 w/v % EDTA in vitro , and the Grass 1988-II article taught that concentrations of EDTA about 0.01 w/v % were needed in vitro to show an effect on corneal permeability of glycerol . Appellants point out that even if Grass 1998-I was interpreted as teaching some miniscule increase in corneal permeability of gatifloxacin with 0.01 w/v % EDTA , the sheer magnitude of improvement observed in Senju 's ¡¬901 and ¡¬904 studies would have been unexpected and surprising . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Appellants further argue that appellees presented no evidence that anyone in 1998 would have expected a low concentration of EDTA to produce a significant increase in gatifloxacin 's corneal permeability . In fact , appellants argue , the remainder of the prior art references , including Grass 1985 , Mitra , and Rojanasakul , reinforce the surprising results of Senju 's ¡¬901 and ¡¬904 studies , as none of these references suggest that the claimed EDTA concentration would result in an increase in aqueous humor concentrations of glycerol and cromolyn . Additionally , the prior art uniformly taught using pH levels higher than the claimed range of 5-6 , confirming the surprising nature of the inventor 's discovery that 0.01 w/v % EDTA formulations significantly increase gatifloxacin concentrations in the aqueous humor even at relatively low pH levels . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Appellees respond that the district court properly found the claims obvious only after considering appellants ' unexpected results evidence and finding it unpersuasive . Despite Senju setting forth a persuasive case before the Examiner at the USPTO , their theories collapsed before the district court . Appellees point out testimony from appellants ' expert who testified that the ¡¬ 901 study did not show the gatifloxacin-0.01 w/v % EDTA solution produced corneal permeability benefits that were statistically significant compared to a non-EDTA solution . Appellees argue that the district court heard testimony from both experts , weighed their credibility , and reviewed Grass 1988-I as a whole before finding more credible Lupin 's expert 's opinions that the skilled person would not interpret Grass 1988-I as teaching `` no increase '' occurred at 0.01 w/v % EDTA . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Appellees also argue that the raw data reported in Grass 1988-I shows that numerically , the corneal permeability levels did increase compared to control even with the 0.01 w/v % EDTA formulations . Appellees point out that the 27 and 40 % permeability increase numbers in the raw data appellants rely on for evidence of unexpected success occurred in studies where all of the numbers ( including control values ) widely varied , with large , unexplained error bars . Appellees argue that if a mere pH adjustment of one unit can produce a 30 % difference in corneal *1353 permeability , and pH adjustments are routinely done , appellants ' 27-40 % change in corneal permeability with 0.01 w/v % EDTA has a magnitude achievable by other formulation tweaks and routine practice . Further , appellees argue , the district court properly found that achieving changes on this order of magnitude reflected the `` product of routine optimization . '' J.A . 33-34 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Appellees argue that the district court properly found the unexpected results evidence unpersuasive because the results of the ¡¬901 and ¡¬904 studies were not statistically significant and merely reported numerical increases that were unsurprising in light of Grass 1988-I . Appellees point out that Dr. Grass only acknowledged that the Senju ¡¬901 study reports a single time point that the study claimed was statistically significant , but that Lupin 's statistician demonstrated this time point was statistically insignificant under a correct analysis . Appellees argue that Senju 's studies achieved nothing better than Grass 1988-I in which 0.01 w/v % EDTA solutions were tested as single doses and showed concentration and time dependence where the 30 minutes ' permeability numbers quadrupled or more than the 20 minute permeability numbers . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We conclude that the district court properly considered evidence of unexpected results , J.A . 32-34 , and did not err in finding that , based on the record and testimony offered , the increase in corneal permeability shown by plaintiffs using a 0.01 w/v % EDTA is not unexpected or surprising , but is a product of routine optimization that would have been obvious to one of skill in the art . J.A . 3334 . These determinations , much like many of the obviousness determinations , were based on credibility judgments on which , on the evidence before us , we defer to the district court . See Celsis In Vitro , 664 F.3d at 929 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We further conclude that the district court properly applied a presumption of validity , considering both the evidence of obviousness and the evidence of unexpected results , to find that appellees set forth clear and convincing evidence of invalidity in this case . See Sciele Pharma Inc. , 684 F.3d at 1260 . We agree that it was not clear error for the district court to conclude that the unexpected results evidence that Senju relied upon during reexamination , J.A . 2692 , did not withstand scrutiny by Lupin 's experts and the district court . Ultimately , the district court properly concluded that the theories presented during reexamination proved too weak when challenged in a judicial forum to rise to the level of unexpected results sufficient to rebut a strong case of obviousness . See Procter & Gamble Co. v. Teva Pharms . USA , Inc. , 566 F.3d 989 , 994 ( Fed.Cir.2009 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We have considered and find unpersuasive the remainder of appellants ' arguments . Concluding that the district court did not err in its judgment that the reexamined claims at issue are invalid for obviousness , we need not reach the issues of infringement and estoppel . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ III . CONCLUSION _NEWLINE_ The judgment of the district court is affirmed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ AFFIRMED _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ NEWMAN , Circuit Judge , dissenting . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In prior litigation , the district court held Senju 's patent claims invalid on the ground of obviousness . Before that decision reached finality , Senju requested PTO reexamination , presenting new claims of significantly narrowed scope . The PTO reexamined Senju 's *1354 U.S. Patent No . 6,333,045 ( `` the ¡¬045 patent '' ) , and held the narrowed claims patentable . In this subsequent litigation , the district court gave no deference to the PTO 's review of the restricted claim scope or the unexpected results at that scope , and held the narrowed claims invalid on the same grounds it previously applied to the original claims.1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ My colleagues on this panel repeat that flawed analysis : they do not consider the scope of the reexamined claims , the unexpected results at that scope , and the teaching-away of the prior art . I respectfully dissent , for these claims have not been shown to be invalid . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ DISCUSSION _NEWLINE_ The Senju inventors discovered that a composition containing the antibiotic gatifloxacin enhances corneal permeability when combined with very low amounts of ethylenediaminetetracetic acid ( EDTA ) at a specific pH . This is the appellants ' Zymar ( r ) product , whose commercial and medicinal success is the impetus for this Hatch-Waxman Act challenge to Senju 's patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The prior art is crowded . It contains much data on quinolones , the family of which gatifloxacin is a member . The prior art also shows the use of chelating agents , such as EDTA , as excipients that enhance stability of ophthalmic medications . However , no combination of prior art references shows or suggests the use of very low concentrations of EDTA to enhance the corneal permeability of antibiotic formulations of gatifloxacin , or of any other quinolone . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In this crowded field , the specific combination and concentration here claimed is not shown , and the published scientific data lead away from the claimed subject matter . These inventors discovered that , when using EDTA at a concentration of 0.01 w/v % , the formulation is not only effective as an antibiotic , but , contrary to the prior art , increases the corneal permeability of gatifloxacin . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I focus specifically on reexamined claim 6 : _NEWLINE_ 6 . A method for raising corneal permeability of an aqueous pharmaceutical Gatifloxacin eye drop solution comprising Gatifloxacin or its salt , having a pH of from above 5 to about 6 containing from about 0.3 to about 0.8 w/v % Gatifloxacin or its salt , which comprises incorporating about 0.01 w/v % disodium edetate into [ eye drops containing Gatifloxacin or its salt ] said Gatifloxacin eye drop solution . _NEWLINE_ ¡¬045 patent , col. 1 l. 25-col. 2 l. 5 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ During reexamination , the PTO examiner found that no reference or combination of references teaches or suggests the improved corneal permeability obtained using EDTA at the low concentration of 0.01 w/v % . The prior art experimental data show either no effect at 0.01 w/v % or enhanced permeability at concentrations above 0.01 w/v % . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ No reference shows improved corneal permeability at such low concentrations of EDTA ; all indications are that the EDTA concentration should be above 0.01 w/v % . The Senju discovery contradicts the observations reported in the prior art . Nonetheless , the panel majority holds that it was obvious that superior results would be obtained by reducing the concentration . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Grass et al . Scientific Articles _NEWLINE_ Of primary import to the district court 's opinion are three publications by Dr. *1355 George M. Grass , et al . The panel majority states that these publications render the claimed combination obvious . To the contrary , these publications teach away from the direction taken by the Senju inventors . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Grass et al. , Mechanisms of Corneal Drug Penetration I : In Vivo and In Vitro Kinetics , 77 J. Pharm . Sci . 3 ( 1988 ) ( `` Grass 1988-T '' ) : _NEWLINE_ The panel majority states that the Grass 1988-I reference shows that the three concentrations of EDTA tested ( 0.1 , 0.05 and 0.01 w/v % ) are effective at enhancing corneal permeability . That is incorrect . Grass 1988-I shows that EDTA at a concentration of 0.01 w/v % produced a zero percent increase in corneal permeability , measured for both methanol and glycerol . Grass 1988-I also states that the in vitro experiments were performed at exposures ( 3 hours ) significantly longer than most topical applications would provide , yet the reported data are that EDTA at 0.01 w/v % was totally ineffective . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Grass 1988-I discusses the work of other investigators , and reports no corneal penetration of mannitol using EDTA at concentrations of 0.2 and 5 mM . Grass 1988-I concludes that corneal permeability increases with increased concentration of EDTA . This leads directly away from any suggestion or expectation of improved permeability of gatifloxacin formulations with concentrations of EDTA as low as 0.01 w/v % . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The appellees concede that Grass 1988-I shows no statistically significant increase in corneal permeability at the low concentration of 0.01 w/v % : `` the data did not reach statistical significance . '' Appellee Br . at 13 . Yet , the panel majority affirms the district court 's unsupported finding that the `` prior art suggests the use of concentrations as low as 0.01 w/v % EDTA would be effective to increase corneal permeability . '' Dist . Ct. Op . at *11 . This finding is contrary to the record . The most that Grass 1988-I can be deemed to `` suggest '' is that the EDTA concentration should be higher than 0.01 w/v % . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The two other cited Grass publications reinforce the `` teaching away '' of the prior art : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Grass et al. , Effects of Calcium Chelating Agents on Corneal Permeability , 26 Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Sci . 110 ( 1985 ) ( `` Grass 1985 '' ) : _NEWLINE_ Grass 1985 describes the effects of the chelating agents EDTA and Cromolyn on corneal permeability of glycerol and progesterone in rabbit eyes . Grass 1985 reports that EDTA at concentrations of 0.5 w/v % increased glycerol concentration in the aqueous humour , and concludes that the addition of chelators at high concentrations or by frequent application may increase the permeability of the corneal epithelium . This reference shows enhanced effects at higher concentrations , not the low concentration in claim 6 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Grass et al. , Mechanisms of Corneal Drug Penetration II : Ultrastructural Analysis of Potential Pathways for Drug Movement , 77 J. Pharm . Sci . 15 ( 1988 ) ( `` Grass 1988-II '' ) : _NEWLINE_ Grass 1988-II describes electron microscope studies of rabbit eyes exposed to EDTA and glycerol , specifically analyzing corneal epithelial cell junctions after treatment with EDTA and glycerol . Grass 1988-II reports that the effects of EDTA depend on concentration and exposure time , and that at concentrations of 0.01 w/v % EDTA , the epithelial tissue showed no visible expansion of the intercellular spaces , which is described as correlating with corneal permeability . The authors interpret these results as showing that `` in vitro concentrations of EDTA above 0.01 % caused increased permeability of the cornea to glycerol . '' Grass 1988-II at 22 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1356 Collectively , the Grass references show or suggest that EDTA must be used at concentrations higher than 0.01 w/v % to effectively increase corneal permeability . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ OPTHALMIC DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEMS , ( Ashim K. Mitra ed. , Marcell Dekker , Inc. , 1993 ) ( `` Mitra '' ) : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Mitra book summarizes the research and knowledge in this field , and states that experiments using low concentrations of EDTA were `` devoid of any effects ( 62 ) , suggesting a concentration dependence . '' Mitra at 188 . Mitra states that EDTA-drug combinations `` deserve investigation , '' but that `` [ i ] t seems likely that the high concentration of divalent cations in the tear film would prevent EDTA from enhancing permeability . '' Id . Mitra adds that while improving drug transport across the cornea found some success , `` it is in the modification of the drug that has generated greater interest . '' Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The panel majority rejects the argument that Mitra teaches away from Senju 's discovery , stating that Mitra does not `` provide any indication that lower EDTA concentrations would not also work . '' Maj. Op . at 1350 . That is not the law of `` teaching away . '' A reference need not foresee a later-discovered invention and warn against it , to teach away from the discovery . Spectralytics , Inc. v. Cordis Corp. , 649 F.3d 1336 , 1343 ( Fed.Cir.2011 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A reference teaches away when it leads to a path divergent from that taken by the patentee . Pozen , Inc. v. Par Pharm. , Inc. , 696 F.3d 1151 , 1165 ( Fed.Cir.2012 ) . Mitra explicitly sets forth two separate paths for investigation-high concentrations of EDTA and drug modification-both of which diverge from the path in claim 6 . The entire body of prior art leads in the direction opposite to reducing the EDTA concentration , for the body of prior art points toward higher , not lower , concentrations of EDTA to enhance corneal permeability . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Other References _NEWLINE_ Three other references relied on by the district court ( U.S. Patent Nos . 4,551,456 ; 4,780,465 ; and 4,980,470 ) make no mention of improving corneal permeability . Those references describe gatifloxacin as an antibiotic and EDTA as a traditional excipient , i.e. , as an inactive drug ingredient ; they contain no teaching or suggestion related to corneal permeability . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Legal Conclusion of Obviousness _NEWLINE_ Obviousness is a matter of foresight , not hindsight . A determination of obviousness requires some reason or suggestion , in the prior art or in common sense , that the claimed subject matter is likely to be effective for its intended purpose . KSR Int ' l Corp. v. Teleflex Inc. , 550 U.S. 398 , 420-22 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 , 167 L.Ed.2d 705 ( 2007 ) . Here , the prior art taught away from the claimed combination when it indicated that higher concentrations of EDTA are needed to enhance corneal permeability . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The panel majority relies on the unsupported opinion of Lupin 's expert witness , and gives that unsupported opinion greater weight than the experimental data . Such reliance is discredited . See Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm. , Inc. , 509 U.S. 579 , 589 , 113 S.Ct . 2786 , 125 L.Ed.2d 469 ( 1993 ) ( `` Proposed testimony must be supported by appropriate validation-i.e. , 'good grounds , ' based on what is known . In short , the requirement that an expert 's testimony pertain to 'scientific knowledge ' establishes a standard of evidentiary reliability. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Contrary to the theory of Lupin 's expert , the extensive Grass data show no statistically significant enhancement of corneal permeability in the experiments using EDTA at low concentrations , or for other chelating agents at low concentrations . *1357 The prior art did not test the specific combination of gatifloxacin and 0.01 w/v % of EDTA and did not discover the subject matter that is here claimed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Notwithstanding the published contrary data , the panel majority calls upon judicial hindsight and finds that persons skilled in the field of the invention would have recognized that 0.01 w/v % EDTA would increase corneal permeability of gatifloxacin formulations . However , the scientists conducting the Grass studies interpreted their data to `` suggest that under conditions of sufficient calcium chelation , either by high enough concentrations of one or more chelators or frequent application at short intervals , preservatives may indeed enter anterior segment tissue . '' Gras 1988-I at 11 . Grass suggested `` high enough concentrations , '' not very low concentrations . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The published contemporaneous statements of scientists interpreting their experiments warrant more weight than unsupported opinions appearing for the first time in litigation . Grass did not test the composition here patented , and reported to be a product now of medical choice . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Senju 's pre-litigation experiments further support the conclusion that one skilled in the art would not have expected to enhance corneal permeability using the method of claim 6 . The district court acknowledged that the claimed levels of EDTA were shown in Senju 's experiments to produce a significant increase in the concentration of gatifloxacin in the aqueous humour . Nevertheless , the court faulted Senju 's expert because he did not use statistical analysis to show that the effects were unexpected . Statistical analysis can indeed be helpful at times , but the perspective of those skilled in the art can not be ignored . With the exception of Lupin 's expert witnesses , those skilled in the art interpreted Senju 's experiments as demonstrating unexpected results . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ CONCLUSION _NEWLINE_ The scientific references , the experimental record , and the commercial success all support the conclusion that the subject matter of claim 6 would not have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill at the time of the invention . The PTO on reexamination correctly applied the law of obviousness . Invalidity of reexamined claim 6 was not proved by clear and convincing evidence .

The United States District Court for the District of New Jersey , Faith S. Hochberg , J. , 16 F.Supp.3d 385 , entered judgment in favor of competitor , and patent holder appealed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Holdings : The Court of Appeals , Hughes , Circuit Judge , held that : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ evidence established that samples of plasma-fluorinated filtration membrane given out at a trade show was a public disclosure that invalidated the patents ; _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ evidence established that patentee engaged in inequitable conduct in obtaining patents ; _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ evidence supported competitor 's antitrust claim ; and _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ attorney fees incurred by competitor defending prior infringement suit were antitrust injury and thus could form the basis for treble damages under the Clayton Act . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Affirmed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Attorneys and Law Firms _NEWLINE_ *1299 Michael Ernest Williams , Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan , LLP , Los Angeles , CA , argued for plaintiff-appellee .

Petty , Boston , MA . _NEWLINE_ Before WALLACH , BRYSON , and HUGHES , Circuit Judges . _NEWLINE_ Opinion _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ HUGHES , Circuit Judge . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 3M sued TransWeb for infringement of several patents . TransWeb sued for declaratory judgment of invalidity and non-infringement of the patents . A jury found the patents to be invalid based on TransWeb 's prior public use of the patented method . In accordance with an advisory verdict from the jury , the district court found the patents unenforceable due to inequitable conduct . The jury also found 3M to be liable for a Walker Process antitrust violation and that attorney fees were an appropriate antitrust remedy . The district court awarded approximately $ 26 million to TransWeb , including trebled attorney fees as antitrust damages . The primary issues are whether sufficient corroborating evidence exists to support the finding of prior public use by TransWeb , and whether the attorney fees are an appropriate basis for damages under the antitrust laws in this context . We hold in the affirmative on both issues . For the latter issue , we find that TransWeb 's attorney fees appropriately flow from the unlawful aspect of 3M 's antitrust violation and thus are an antitrust injury that can properly serve as the basis for antitrust damages . For these reasons , we affirm the district court 's judgment . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I _NEWLINE_ TransWeb and 3M are both manufacturers of filters for respirators , such as might be worn by workers in a dirty or otherwise contaminated worksite . The filter media at issue in this case consist of `` nonwoven fibrous webs , '' which rely on a `` web '' of fibers rather than traditional woven material . Both TransWeb and 3M use a process of melting pellets of a filter material , such as polypropylene , blowing the melted material into a thin film , and then allowing the material to cool and solidify into the nonwoven fibrous web . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ It had been known in the art for some time that a filter medium could be improved by imparting upon it an electrical charge . In this way , the filter medium can repel or capture particulates both by mechanical and electromagnetic means . A filter medium on which a semipermanent electrical charge has been imparted is referred to as an `` electret . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ TransWeb and 3M independently developed a technique for imparting this electret characteristic by using plasma fluorination . Fluorination involves introducing fluorine atoms into the chemical structure of the filter web . Previously known techniques involved mixing fluorine compounds *1300 into the melted filter material , but this proved disadvantageous . Instead , TransWeb and 3M both discovered that it would be advantageous to first form the fibrous web and then introduce the fluorine atoms into the chemical structure . This technique involves exposing a gaseous fluorine compound to the surface of the filter web in the presence of plasma . The intense heat and electromagnetic energy introduced by the plasma cause some of the chemical bonds on the surface of the filter web to break , and the fluorine atoms fill in those bonds to form fluorine compounds on the surface of the filter web . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Plasma-fluorinated filter media are particularly effective in oily environments , where other types of filter media might perform poorly or quickly degrade . The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) provides a rating and approval service for oily environment respirators , categorizing them as : not resistant to oil ; resistant to oil ; or oil proof . The Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) provides regulations governing what NIOSH rating of respirators must be used in certain types of worksites within the United States . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The present appeal focuses largely on the events surrounding a filtration industry exposition that occurred in late April and early May of 1997 . It is uncontested that TransWeb 's founder , Kumar Ogale , attended the expo and handed out samples of filter material . The filter material included samples of TransWeb 's `` T-Melt '' products , an identifier for the general class of melt-blown , i.e. , nonwoven fibrous web , media . The primary dispute is whether Mr. Ogale handed out , more specifically , samples of the `` T-Melt P '' products , which is the specific class of plasma-fluorinated T-Melt products . Mr. Ogale testified at trial that he did in fact hand out T-Melt P samples at the expo , though no independent documents or testimony evidence this fact . The parties do not contest that if Mr. Ogale handed out T-Melt P samples at the expo , then they would serve as prior art to the plasma fluorination technique of the claimed methods . The expo occurred more than one year prior to the priority date of the patents asserted in this case , so any public disclosure of plasma fluorination at the expo would be a statutory bar to patentability , at least based on that feature . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In July of 1998 , 3M filed U.S. Patent Application 09/109,497 , to which both of U.S . Patents 6,397,458 and 6,808,551 claim earliest priority . 3M asserted both the ¡¬458 and ¡¬551 patents against TransWeb . In addition to the plasma fluorination of nonwoven fibrous webs described above , the patent family discloses use of `` hydro-charging , '' which is a technique that uses water to impart the electrical charge on the filter medium . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 3M initially filed suit in Minnesota against TransWeb for patent infringement . After 3M voluntarily dismissed that suit due to an apparent personal jurisdiction issue , TransWeb filed suit in New Jersey for declaratory judgment . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court in New Jersey ultimately presented the following issues to a jury : infringement of claims 31 and 57 of the ¡¬458 patent ; invalidity for obviousness of claims 31 and 57 ; unenforceability of the ¡¬458 and ¡¬551 patents due to inequitable conduct ; Walker Process antitrust violation based on fraudulent procurement and subsequent assertion of the ¡¬458 and ¡¬ 551 patents ; sham litigation antitrust violation based on assertion of the ¡¬458 and ¡¬551 patents ; entitlement to lost profits damages for antitrust violations ; and entitlement to attorney fees as damages for antitrust violations . The jury delivered the following verdicts : claims 31 and 57 are not infringed ; claims 31 and 57 are invalid ; both patents are unenforceable ; *1301 3M committed a Walker Process violation but not a sham litigation violation ; and TransWeb is entitled to lost profits and attorney fees as antitrust damages . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court entered judgment in accordance with the jury verdicts . 3M moved for judgment as a matter of law , which the district court denied . 3M appeals . We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C . ¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ II _NEWLINE_ This court reviews denial of a JMOL motion de novo , applying the law of the regional circuit . Am . Calcar , Inc. v. Am . Honda Motor Co. , 651 F.3d 1318 , 1341 ( Fed.Cir.2011 ) . In the Third Circuit , courts assess `` whether there is evidence upon which a reasonable jury could properly have found its verdict . '' Gomez v. Allegheny Health Servs. , 71 F.3d 1079 , 1083 ( 3d Cir.1995 ) . JMOL `` should be granted only if , viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant and giving it the advantage of every fair and reasonable inference , there is insufficient evidence from which a jury reasonably could find '' for the nonmovant .

Eaton Corp. , 696 F.3d 254 , 268 ( 3d Cir.2012 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On appeal , 3M challenges the district court 's judgment on validity , inequitable conduct , and antitrust liability . We address each argument in turn . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ III _NEWLINE_ The jury found both claims of the ¡¬458 patent invalid , and the district court denied 3M 's motion for JMOL of non-invalidity . 3M contests this judgment based on a purported lack of corroboration of Mr. Ogale 's public use testimony and based on alleged non-obviousness of the claims even if there were public use of the plasma-fluorinated material . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A _NEWLINE_ Oral testimony by an interested party on its own will generally not suffice as `` clear and convincing '' evidence of invalidity . See Lazare Kaplan Int ' l v. Photoscribe Techs. , 628 F.3d 1359 , 1374 ( Fed.Cir.2010 ) ; Price v. Symsek , 988 F.2d 1187 , 1194 ( Fed.Cir.1993 ) . Rather , such oral testimony must be corroborated by some other evidence . See Woodland Tr . v. Flowertree Nursery , Inc. , 148 F.3d 1368 , 1371 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) . The corroborating evidence can include documents and testimonial evidence . See Lazare Kaplan , 628 F.3d at 1374-75 , Adenta GmbH v. OrthoArm , Inc. , 501 F.3d 1364 , 1371 ( Fed.Cir.2007 ) , Sandt Tech . v. Resco Metal & Plastics Corp. , 264 F.3d 1344 , 1350-51 ( Fed.Cir.2001 ) . Circumstantial evidence can be sufficient . See Sandt , 264 F.3d at 1351 ; Knorr v. Pearson , 671 F.2d 1368 , 1373 ( C.C.P.A.1982 ) . This corroboration requirement for testimony by an interested party is based on the sometimes unreliable nature of oral testimony , due to the `` forgetfulness of witnesses , their liability to mistakes , their proneness to recollect things as the party calling them would have them recollect , aside from the temptation to actual perjury . '' Lazare Kaplan , 628 F.3d at 1374 ( quoting Washburn & Moen Mfg . Co. v. Beat 'Em All Barbed-Wire Co. , 143 U.S. 275 , 284 , 12 S.Ct . 443 , 36 L.Ed . 154 ( 1892 ) ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A `` rule of reason '' analysis is used to determine the sufficiency of corroboration , under which `` all pertinent evidence is examined in order to determine whether the inventor 's story is credible . '' Sandt , 264 F.3d at 1350 ( quoting Price , 988 F.2d at 1195 ) ( internal quotation marks omitted ) . Importantly , this analysis `` does not require that every detail of *1302 the testimony be independently and conclusively supported '' by the corroborating evidence . Ohio Willow Wood Co. v. Alps South , 735 F.3d 1333 , 1348 ( Fed.Cir.2013 ) . Such a requirement would indeed be `` the antithesis of the rule of reason . '' Cooper v. Goldfarb , 154 F.3d 1321 , 1331 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) . We have generally been most skeptical of oral testimony that is supported only by testimonial evidence of other interested persons . Compare Allergan , Inc. v. Apotex Inc. , 754 F.3d 952 , 968 ( Fed.Cir.2014 ) , and Lacks Indus . v. McKechnie Vehicle Components USA , 322 F.3d 1335 , 1350 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) , with Adenta , 501 F.3d at 1371-73 , and Sandt , 264 F.3d at 1351-52 . We have repeatedly noted that contemporaneous documentary evidence provides greater corroborative value . See Medichem , S.A. v. Rolabo , S.L. , 437 F.3d 1157 , 1169-70 ( Fed.Cir.2006 ) ; Sandt , 264 F.3d at 1350-51 ; Finnigan Corp. v. Int ' l Trade Comm ' n , 180 F.3d 1354 , 1366 ( Fed.Cir.1999 ) ; Woodland Tr. , 148 F.3d at 1373 ; Price , 988 F.2d at 1196 . But there are no hard and fast rules as to what constitutes sufficient corroboration , and each case must be decided on its own facts . See Sandt , 264 F.3d at 1350 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We treat the ultimate determination of whether such oral testimony is sufficiently corroborated as a question of fact , which we review for clear error . See Fleming v. Escort , Inc. , 774 F.3d 1371 , 1377 ( Fed.Cir.2014 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 3M 's arguments against sufficiency of corroboration can be summed up as follows : as a legal matter , TransWeb must independently evidence all `` material facts '' of the purported invalidating public use ; and as a factual matter , TransWeb provided no corroborating evidence for one of the material facts , viz. , that it was the plasma-fluorinated material that was distributed at the expo . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 3M 's legal argument attempts to lead us to a legal conclusion that this court has repeatedly rejected . 3M asks us to focus on one particular detail of the oral testimony and determine whether that detail is independently evidenced . But we have repeatedly rejected an element-wise attack on corroboration of oral testimony . See Fleming , 774 F.3d at 1377 ; Ohio Willow Wood , 735 F.3d at 1348 ( characterizing as `` misplaced '' an argument that a particular claim feature in oral testimony was not separately evidenced , and finding the argument incompatible with the rule of reason ) ; Lazare Kaplan , 628 F.3d at 1373-75 ; Adenta , 501 F.3d at 1371-73 . We stated this in clear terms most recently in Fleming : _NEWLINE_ Fleming is correct that none of the corroborating evidence constitutes definitive proof of Orr 's account or discloses each claim limitation as written . But the corroboration requirement has never been so demanding . It is a flexible , rule-of-reason demand for independent evidence that , as a whole , makes credible the testimony of the purported prior inventor with regard to conception and reduction to practice of the invention as claimed . _NEWLINE_ Fleming , 774 F.3d at 1377 ( citations omitted ) . As applied to this case , our rule of reason analysis requires that independent evidence , taken as a whole , makes credible Mr. Ogale 's testimony that he distributed the plasma-fluorinated material at the expo . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In any event , 3M 's factual argument that TransWeb provided no corroborating evidence that it was the plasma-fluorinated material that Mr. Ogale distributed at the expo is incorrect . The correspondence with Fourth State demonstrates that TransWeb had produced the plasma-fluorinated material at least three months prior to the expo . TransWeb 's own patent application , filed at the same time as the expo , demonstrates that Mr. Ogale had *1303 invented and was seeking patent protection for the plasma-fluorinated material at least by the time of the expo . The correspondence with Filtration Group demonstrates that Mr. Ogale was sending out samples of the plasma-fluorinated T-Melt product shortly after the expo . The numerous correspondences contemporaneous with the Filtration Group correspondence , each accompanying samples of filter material not specifically identified as T-Melt , show that Mr. Ogale was sending out other samples of filter material that may have been plasma-fluorinated . The correspondence with Gerson demonstrates that TransWeb was offering for sale large quantities of the plasma-fluorinated product within two months of the expo . Considered in its totality , this body of evidence provides abundant support for the credibility of Mr. Ogale 's claim that he distributed the plasma-fluorinated material at the expo . As such , we find no clear error in the district court 's determination that Mr. Ogale 's testimony was sufficiently corroborated . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B _NEWLINE_ 3M argues that , even if TransWeb publicly used plasma-fluorinated material at the expo , the claims are still non-obvious . 3M 's argument rests on two contentions : for claim 31 , it was not obvious to use hydrocharging on a plasma-fluorinated material ; and for both claims 31 and 57 , objective indicia demonstrate the non-obviousness of the claims . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 3M admits that hydrocharging was well-known in the art , at least based on U.S. Patent 5,496,507 to Angadjivand . But 3M notes that the Angadjivand patent counsels against `` any unnecessary treatment which might increase [ the filter material 's ] electrical connectivity '' including `` ultraviolet irradiation . '' Angadjivand patent col. 3 ll . 26-30 . Based on the testimony of both TransWeb 's and 3M 's expert witnesses , the filter material is exposed to some ultraviolet radiation during plasma fluorination . But TransWeb 's expert witness also testified that the amount of ultraviolet radiation emitted during plasma fluorination was minimal , refuting the notion that the above-quoted passage of the Angadjivand patent would have significantly discouraged a person having ordinary skill in the art from using hydrocharging on plasma-fluorinated material . The jury was free to credit this testimony and conclude based on the evidence presented that claim 31 was obvious . We see no error in this determination . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 3M further contends that unexpected results and commercial success demonstrate the non-obviousness of the claims . For commercial success , 3M relies on a single , confused exchange between its attorney and TransWeb 's expert witness at trial , wherein the witness says that he does not know about the commercial success of 3M 's products , though maybe he said he did in the past . J.A . 2105-06 . Similarly with unexpected results , 3M relies on a single , self-serving annotation in the ¡¬458 patent inventor 's notebook and a corresponding statement at trial . The jury heard and rejected this evidence in concluding that the claims were obvious . None of these arguments as to objective indicia demonstrate that the jury was unreasonable in finding the claims obvious , so we will not disturb that verdict . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ IV _NEWLINE_ The jury reached an advisory verdict that both the ¡¬458 and ¡¬551 patents were unenforceable for inequitable conduct . The district court reached the same conclusion . 3M contests this judgment on all of the required elements of inequitable conduct . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A judgment of inequitable conduct requires clear and convincing evidence *1304 of materiality , knowledge of materiality , and a deliberate decision to deceive . Therasense , Inc. v. Becton , Dickinson & Co. , 649 F.3d 1276 , 1290 ( Fed.Cir.2011 ) ( en banc ) . Except in cases of egregious misconduct , the materiality must reach the level of but-for materiality , meaning that `` the PTO would not have allowed a claim had it been aware of the undisclosed prior art . '' Id . at 1291-92 . Intent to deceive may be found only if specific intent to deceive is `` the single most reasonable inference able to be drawn from the evidence . '' Id . at 1290 . If more than one reasonable inference is possible , `` intent to deceive can not be found . '' Id . at 1290-91 . A court `` may infer intent from indirect and circumstantial evidence '' because `` direct evidence of deceptive intent is rare . '' Id . at 1290 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This court reviews the district court 's ultimate determination of inequitable conduct for abuse of discretion and underlying factual determinations for clear error . Star Scientific v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco , 537 F.3d 1357 , 1365 ( Fed.Cir.2008 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A _NEWLINE_ The expo samples present a definitional case of but-for materiality . During prosecution of the ¡¬497 application , the examiner initially allowed all claims . When 3M notified the examiner of one of the TransWeb samples that it had on hand , the examiner rejected all claims as obvious over that disclosure and the Angadjivand patent . Only when 3M clarified its dubious assertion that the TransWeb samples were only received after signing of a confidentiality agreement and thus were not prior art did the examiner allow the claims . Because the examiner would not have allowed the claims had the TransWeb samples been properly disclosed as prior art , the TransWeb samples are but-for material . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B _NEWLINE_ The district court concluded based on a detailed review of the record that Marvin Jones , an inventor for the asserted patents , and Karl Hanson , an in-house attorney at 3M , both acted with specific intent to deceive the patent office as to the TransWeb materials . The jury unanimously reached the same conclusion . While it is not necessary for us to recount the entire treatment of the factual record performed so thoroughly by the district court , see TransWeb , LLC v. 3M Innovative Properties Co. , 16 F.Supp.3d 385 , 398-407 ( D.N.J.2014 ) , we note a few particular details that demonstrate that the district court did not clearly err in finding a specific intent to deceive on the part of Mr. Jones and Mr. Hanson . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The record makes abundantly clear that 3M generally and Mr. Jones particularly were very much aware of the samples TransWeb was distributing at the expo . A week prior to the expo , a group of six 3M employees was party to a lengthy email coordinating 3M 's efforts to gather information from TransWeb at the expo . The email identified two employees as the `` point people '' in gathering information from TransWeb . J.A . 6860 . The other parties to the email and their subordinates were to channel any questions through the point people . One of the point people had already met with TransWeb and received `` quite a bit of information and non-production samples . '' Id . The email also included an article from Nonwovens Industry briefly mentioning TransWeb 's T-Melt products . One of the parties to the email was Mr. Jones 's supervisor , and she forwarded the email to Mr. Jones on the day that the expo began . Mr. Jones attended the expo . While he professed at trial to have no recollection of visiting the TransWeb booth , the district court found his testimony `` simply not credible '' and noted that *1305 `` his demeanor was one of a witness trying to distance himself from any knowledge of TransWeb 's presence and activities at the Expo . '' TransWeb , 16 F.Supp.3d at 399 . Mr. Jones 's supervisor again sent him an email within a month after the expo detailing the information and samples received from TransWeb by the point people . This email noted that TransWeb 's production operations were up and running , that it was sending samples to potential clients , that 3M already had a small sample , and that 3M was expecting a larger sample soon thereafter . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Further evidence shows that Mr. Jones knew not only that TransWeb distributed material at the expo , but that it was plasma-fluorinated material . Within a year of the expo , Mr. Jones was told directly by an employee of Racal-an independent filtration company at the time of the expo that was acquired by 3M in the following year-that TransWeb had been producing plasma-fluorinated material and that TransWeb had provided samples of such to Racal . The district court noted that the 3M employees seemed to proceed with a newfound earnest in preparing their own patent application and supporting lab notebooks around this same time . The Racal employee eventually sent the samples received from TransWeb to Mr. Jones , identifying them as being plasma-fluorinated . Around the same time , another 3M employee forwarded the original expo planning email to Mr. Jones and Mr. Hanson , noting that it did not explicitly indicate plasma fluorination . The district court found that this email indicated a follow-up to some sort of oral conversation between Mr. Jones , Mr. Hanson , and the other 3M employee regarding what TransWeb was distributing at the time of the expo . Another 3M employee later requested samples of the plasma-fluorinated material from TransWeb on behalf of Mr. Jones and Mr. Hanson , noting that some of the products had been mentioned in the pre-expo Nonwovens Industry publication . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court found that Mr. Hanson undertook an intentional scheme to paper over the potentially prior art nature of the Racal-received samples . The Racal employees received the plasma-fluorinated samples from TransWeb at latest one month after the expo . Therefore , these samples were highly relevant to what TransWeb distributed at the expo . The record casts great doubt on whether Racal had received the samples before or after execution of a confidentiality agreement , thereby potentially rendering them public disclosures and prior art to the ¡¬497 application . At around the same time that 3M was requesting further samples from TransWeb and learning of the potential prior art nature of the Racal samples , Mr. Hanson sent a confusing letter to Mr. Ogale purporting to clarify some issues as to the confidentially agreements between TransWeb and 3M and between TransWeb and Racal . Mr. Hanson had never had any communication with TransWeb , and the district court concluded that the only possible purpose for the letter was to get an admission from Mr. Ogale that the Racal-received samples were covered by a confidentiality agreement , even though this point was itself dubious . Mr. Hanson subsequently did submit this letter to the patent office as definitive proof that the TransWeb samples were not prior art to the ¡¬497 application . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court noted other circumstantial evidence suggesting a specific intent by 3M employees to hide the prior art nature of the TransWeb products . The district court noted that only after Mr. Hanson met with the Racal employee did that employee type meeting notes from his original meeting with Mr. Ogale after the expo . Those typed notes contained additional information regarding patents that *1306 had not been in the original handwritten notes . The district court noted that Mr. Hanson waited several years between learning of the potential TransWeb prior art and informing the patent office . In fact , Mr. Hanson did not disclose the TransWeb material to the patent office until after negotiations for 3M to purchase TransWeb had broken down . Further , Mr. Hanson waited until the last possible moment , when a notice of allowance had already been mailed , to submit the TransWeb material in a request for continued prosecution . The district court found Mr. Hanson 's testimony at trial attempting to explain this delay wholly incredible . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Based on these factual findings , the district court concluded that the only reasonable inference that explains the actions of Mr. Hanson and Mr. Jones is that they strategically delayed in disclosing the TransWeb prior art and then intentionally made an inaccurate disclosure of that material . We can find no clear error in this conclusion , particularly as the district court 's findings are based in large degree on its determinations that Mr. Jones and Mr. Hanson were not credible during relevant parts of their testimony . See In re Rosuvastatin Calcium Patent Litig. , 703 F.3d 511 , 521 ( Fed.Cir.2012 ) ( `` 'This court may not reassess , and indeed is incapable of reassessing , witness credibility and motive issues on review . ' `` ( quoting LNP Eng ' g Plastics , Inc. v. Miller Waste Mills , Inc. , 275 F.3d 1347 , 1361 ( Fed.Cir.2001 ) ) ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Finding no clear error in the district court 's determinations on both materiality and specific intent , and finding no other improprieties in the district court 's analysis , we see no abuse of discretion in the district court 's ultimate conclusion of unenforceability for inequitable conduct . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ V _NEWLINE_ The jury found that 3M committed a Walker Process antitrust violation , and awarded TransWeb damages of lost profits and attorney fees . The district court denied 3M 's motion for JMOL . 3M contests this judgment based on several purported flaws in market definitions for the antitrust claim and based on the theory that TransWeb 's attorney fees are not appropriate antitrust damages for the Walker Process violation . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In Walker Process , the Supreme Court held that a plaintiff could bring an action under ¡± 2 of the Sherman Act based on the alleged maintenance and enforcement of a fraudulently-obtained patent . See Walker Process Equip . v. Food Mach . & Chem . Corp. , 382 U.S. 172 , 173-74 , 86 S.Ct . 347 , 15 L.Ed.2d 247 ( 1965 ) . In order to prevail on a Walker Process claim , the antitrust-plaintiff must show two things : first , that the antitrust-defendant obtained the patent by knowing and willful fraud on the patent office and maintained and enforced the patent with knowledge of the fraudulent procurement ; and second , all the other elements necessary to establish a Sherman Act monopolization claim . See Ritz Camera & Image v. SanDisk Corp. , 700 F.3d 503 , 506 ( Fed.Cir.2012 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ TransWeb 's monopolization claim arises under ¡± 2 of the Sherman Act as an `` attempt to monopolize . '' 15 U.S.C . ¡± 2 ( 2012 ) . The `` other elements '' necessary to establish an attempted monopolization claim are : `` ( 1 ) that the defendant has engaged in predatory or anticompetitive conduct with ( 2 ) a specific intent to monopolize and ( 3 ) a dangerous probability of achieving monopoly power . '' Spectrum Sports , Inc. v. McQuillan , 506 U.S. 447 , 456 , 113 S.Ct . 884 , 122 L.Ed.2d 247 ( 1993 ) . In determining the dangerous probability of achieving monopoly power for element ( 3 ) , the courts look at `` the relevant market and the defendant 's ability to lessen or destroy competition in that market . '' Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1307 In this case , 3M does not contest that TransWeb 's inequitable conduct showing , if affirmed , along with 3M 's bringing of the infringement suit proves the first Walker Process requirement , as well as elements ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of the second Walker Process requirement . We have previously explained that Walker Process liability requires a higher , more specific showing of `` knowing and willful fraud '' than the more inclusive inequitable conduct doctrine . Nobelpharma AB v. Implant Innovations , 141 F.3d 1059 , 1069 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) ; see also Dippin ' Dots , Inc. v. Mosey , 476 F.3d 1337 , 1346-48 ( Fed.Cir.2007 ) . After Therasense , the showing required for proving inequitable conduct and the showing required for proving the fraud component of Walker Process liability may be nearly identical . See , e.g. , Gideon Mark & T. Leigh Anenson , Inequitable Conduct and Walker Process Claims After Therasense and the America Invents Act , 16 U. PA. J . BUS . L. 361 , 402 n. 258 ( 2014 ) . Regardless , because 3M does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury 's Walker Process fraud finding beyond challenging the inequitable conduct finding , we will accept as admitted that TransWeb sufficiently demonstrated the Walker Process fraud component . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Instead , 3M challenges whether the district court properly defined the relevant market for determining dangerous probability of monopoly power in element ( 3 ) , and whether the award of TransWeb 's attorney fees is appropriate even if the Walker Process case were proven . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A _NEWLINE_ The relevant market is defined by both a product market and a geographic market . See Brown Shoe Co. v. United States , 370 U.S. 294 , 324 , 82 S.Ct . 1502 , 8 L.Ed.2d 510 ( 1962 ) . This court applies the law of the regional circuit as to market definition . See Nobelpharma , 141 F.3d at 1068 . Under Third Circuit law , the definition of both the product and geographic boundaries of the relevant market is a question of fact . See Gordon v. Lewistown Hosp. , 423 F.3d 184 , 212 ( 3d Cir.2005 ) ; Weiss v. York Hosp. , 745 F.2d 786 , 825 ( 3d Cir.1984 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ TransWeb defined two distinct markets : an `` upstream '' market for `` fluorinated polymeric material '' and a `` downstream '' market for NIOSH-certified respirators in the United States . 3M challenges the scope of the relevant products for the former and the geographic scope for the latter . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ i _NEWLINE_ The relevant product market consists of all products that are `` reasonably interchangeable by consumers for the same purposes . '' United States v. E.I . du Pont de Nemours & Co. , 351 U.S. 377 , 395 , 76 S.Ct . 994 , 100 L.Ed . 1264 ( 1956 ) ; see also Queen City Pizza v. Domino 's Pizza , 124 F.3d 430 , 436 ( 3d Cir.1997 ) . `` Reasonable interchangeability '' may be determined by looking at price , use , and qualities of the products . See E.I . du Pont de Nemours , 351 U.S. at 404 , 76 S.Ct . 994 ; Tunis Bros. Co. v. Ford Motor Co. , 952 F.2d 715 , 722 ( 3d Cir.1991 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 3M argues that the district court erred in limiting the upstream market to fluorinated products . In particular , 3M argues that non-fluorinated filter media , such as fiberglass and pleated material , are interchangeable with fluorinated media , and that TransWeb 's expert admitted as much . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ While 3M points to evidence supporting a conclusion that fluorinated material does not form a distinct market , this does not undermine the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury 's conclusion to the contrary . Evidence demonstrated that : fluorinated material has a lower pressure drop while maintaining high filtration , as compared *1308 to other filter media ; fluorinated material has a longer service life than other filter media ; and customers would pay more for respirators with the fluorinated media . Taken together , this evidence provides a sufficient basis on which a reasonable jury could conclude that the price , use , and qualities of fluorinated material render it a distinct market from other filter media . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ii _NEWLINE_ `` The relevant geographic market is the area in which a potential buyer may rationally look for the goods or services he or she seeks .

Ass ' n of Pa. , 745 F.2d 248 , 260 ( 3d Cir.1984 ) ) . `` Consequently , the geographic market is not comprised of the region in which the seller attempts to sell its product , but rather is comprised of the area where his customers would look to buy such a product . '' Id . at 726 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 3M argues that the district court erred in limiting the downstream market for NIOSH-certified respirators to the United States . In particular , 3M argues that buyers look to overseas companies to purchase NIOSH-certified respirators , and that TransWeb 's expert testimony on the relevant geographic market was without basis . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 3M 's argument is based primarily on an artificial distinction . By repeatedly pointing to the potential for buyers to purchase NIOSH-certified respirators from foreign manufacturers , 3M implies that the `` United States '' market only includes respirators manufactured in the United States . But TransWeb 's expert clarified that sales of NIOSH-certified respirators in the United States by foreign manufacturers were already included in his calculations for the `` United States '' geographic market . See J.A . 2299 . As such , the flaw proffered by 3M in the definition of the geographic market is not present . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Beyond this artificial distinction , there is also no lack of evidence to support the jury 's verdict . The district court noted that the NIOSH certifications are relevant to companies operating in the United States , as the United States OSHA promulgates regulations regarding the use of NIOSH-certified respirators by employees . As such , the jury could have reasonably concluded that NIOSH certification is most relevant to buyers in the United States , given that OSHA 's regulations are limited to the United States . Evidence also demonstrated that 3M itself reviewed sales in the United States market distinct from other markets . Finally , while 3M notes that TransWeb 's expert did not perform any `` calculations '' to determine that the United States is the relevant geographic market , his testimony was still based on expert opinion on which the jury was entitled to rely . Therefore , there was a sufficient basis on which a reasonable jury could conclude that the United States was the relevant geographic market for the NIOSH-certified respirators . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B _NEWLINE_ 3M 's final challenge is to the district court 's award of attorney fees as antitrust damages . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Section 4 of the Clayton Act provides that `` any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws ... shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained , and the cost of suit , including a reasonable attorney 's fee . '' 15 U.S.C . ¡± 15 ( a ) ( 2012 ) . The jury concluded that TransWeb was entitled to its lost profits and attorney fees in recompense for 3M 's antitrust violation . The jury found 3M liable for approximately $ 34,000 in lost profits , which the district court *1309 awarded to TransWeb as the trebled amount of approximately $ 103,000 . After review by a special master , the district court concluded that TransWeb incurred approximately $ 3.2 million in attorney fees prosecuting the antitrust claim and approximately $ 7.7 million defending the infringement suit . The district court awarded the $ 3.2 million on a one-for-one basis as `` cost of suit '' fees . The district court awarded the $ 7.7 million trebled to approximately $ 23 million as damages . 3M does not appeal the lost profits or cost of suit fees . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 3M argues that the district court erred in awarding the $ 23 million of attorney-fees damages , because TransWeb failed to show any link between those attorney fees and an impact on competition . 3M argues that those attorney fees had no effect on competition because they did not force TransWeb out of the market or otherwise affect prices in the market . On this basis , 3M argues that those attorney fees are not an antitrust injury and thus can not be a proper basis for antitrust damages . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Section 4 of the Clayton Act does not provide recompense for any injury causally linked to a violation of the antitrust laws , but rather only for antitrust injury . See Atl . Richfield Co. v. USA Petroleum Co. , 495 U.S. 328 , 334 , 110 S.Ct . 1884 , 109 L.Ed.2d 333 ( 1990 ) ; Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat , Inc. , 429 U.S. 477 , 489 , 97 S.Ct . 690 , 50 L.Ed.2d 701 ( 1977 ) . TransWeb 's injury-in-fact of $ 7.7 million must be `` attributable to an anti-competitive aspect of the practice under scrutiny '' in order to qualify as an antitrust injury . Atl . Richfield , 495 U.S. at 334 , 110 S.Ct . 1884 . Stated another way , TransWeb 's injury-in-fact must `` stem [ ] from a competition-reducing aspect or effect of the defendant 's behavior , '' not from competition-increasing or competition-neutral aspects . Id . at 344 , 110 S.Ct . 1884 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 3M 's argument focuses on the fact that the harmful effect on competition proven by TransWeb at trial never actually came about . TransWeb proved at trial that increased prices for fluorinated filter media and respirators would have resulted had 3M succeeded in its suit . However , because TransWeb prevailed , these effects never materialized . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We do not read the antitrust injury requirement from Atlantic Richfield , Brunswick , and similar cases to so narrowly define the scope of antitrust injury . Those cases dealt with situations where the antitrust-defendants ' actions , though unlawful , would not have actually reduced competition . See , e.g. , Atl . Richfield , 495 U.S. at 337-38 , 110 S.Ct . 1884 ( rejecting attempt to recover profits lost due to an increase in competition and reduction in prices caused by vertical , maximum-price-fixing arrangement ) ; Cargill , Inc. v. Monfort of Colo. , Inc. , 479 U.S. 104 , 114-17 , 107 S.Ct . 484 , 93 L.Ed.2d 427 ( 1986 ) ( rejecting attempt to block merger on the theory that the merged companies would increase competition and lower prices ) ; Brunswick , 429 U.S. at 487-88 , 97 S.Ct . 690 ( rejecting attempt to recover lost marginal profits that were not achieved because an acquiring company purchased a failing company , thus maintaining competition with the antitrust-plaintiff ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In this case , however , 3M 's unlawful act was in fact aimed at reducing competition and would have done so had the suit been successful . 3M 's unlawful act was the bringing of suit based on a patent known to be fraudulently obtained . What made this act unlawful under the antitrust laws was its attempt to gain a monopoly based on this fraudulently-obtained patent . TransWeb 's attorney fees flow directly from this unlawful aspect of 3M 's act . That is , TransWeb 's attorney fees `` flow [ ] from that which makes [ 3M 's ] acts unlawful , '' *1310 Brunswick , 429 U.S. at 489 , 97 S.Ct . 690 , and are `` attributable to [ this ] anti-competitive aspect of the practice under scrutiny , '' Atl . Richfield , 495 U.S. at 334 , 110 S.Ct . 1884 . The `` competition-reducing aspect , '' id . at 344 , 110 S.Ct . 1884 , of 3M 's behavior was its attempt at achieving a monopoly by bringing the subject lawsuit . 3M 's failure to prevail in that lawsuit does not make the resultant attorney fees any less attributable to that behavior , and the attorney fees are precisely `` the type of loss that the claimed violations would be likely to cause , '' Brunswick , 429 U.S. at 489 , 97 S.Ct . 690 ( quoting Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research , Inc. , 395 U.S. 100 , 125 , 89 S.Ct . 1562 , 23 L.Ed.2d 129 ( 1969 ) ) ( internal ellipses omitted ) . Therefore , TransWeb 's attorney fees are both injury-in-fact and antitrust injury . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 3M relies on Comcast Corp. v. Behrend , -- - U.S. -- -- , 133 S.Ct . 1426 , 185 L.Ed.2d 515 ( 2013 ) , as foreclosing TransWeb 's recovery of attorney fees as antitrust damages . But 3M relies on Comcast primarily to refute TransWeb 's notion that it can separate the antitrust injury in ¡± 4 from the injury-in-fact used for the basis of damages in ¡± 4 . On this point we agree with 3M . Section 4 only contemplates a single injury , i.e. , it does not allow one antitrust injury and a separate injury-in-fact that is used for the basis of damages . But this flaw in TransWeb 's position does not undo the damages award . TransWeb 's attorney fees are themselves both injury-in-fact and sufficiently stemming from the competition-reducing aspect of 3M 's behavior to qualify as antitrust injury . The district court instructed the jury in accordance with this proper interpretation of the law , and TransWeb presented sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that these requirements of ¡± 4 were met . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This conclusion is supported by the only persuasive authority that addresses the award of attorney fees as damages for a Walker Process violation : Kearney & Trecker Corp. v. Cincinnati Milacron Inc. , 562 F.2d 365 , ( 6th Cir.1977 ) . In Kearney , the district court found the patentee liable under ¡± 2 of the Sherman Act based on the Walker Process theory of liability . See id . at 372-73 . The patentee had obtained a patent through inequitable conduct and later sued the defendant for infringement of that patent . See id . at 368-69 , 371-72 . The appeals court held that the defendant 's attorney fees could be awarded as ¡± 4 damages even though `` [ the defendant ] did not prove direct market place damages resulting from [ the patentee 's ] anticompetitive acts . '' Id . at 374-75 . The court relied on the reasoning from the district court that the patentee forced the defendant into a position of having to choose from three alternatives : cease competition , take a license , or defend the infringement action . See id . at 374 . The appeals court held that `` one who has established or is attempting to establish an illegal monopoly by fraud on the Patent Office or misuse of a patent should not be permitted to further this goal by means of an infringement suit . When the antitrust violations are causally connected to the infringement action it is permissible to include the expenses of defending that action in the award of damages . '' Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ While a causal connection is no longer a sufficient connection after Brunswick , 429 U.S. at 489 , 97 S.Ct . 690 , decided that same year , the core logic in Kearney is still valid : the patentee instigated an anticompetitive suit that forced the defendant to choose between ceasing competition , taking a disadvantageous position in competition ( taking a license ) , or defending the suit . Because the injury suffered by the antitrust-plaintiff under each choice flows from the anticompetitive aspect of the patent owner 's behavior , each can be recovered as antitrust damages . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1311 3M had indicated that it would not license its patents to TransWeb . Therefore , in response to 3M 's anticompetitive infringement suit , TransWeb had only the options of ceasing competition altogether or defending the suit . Had TransWeb chosen the first option , evidence at trial demonstrated that TransWeb would have been forced out of the market and higher prices would have resulted . So , harmful effects on competition would have resulted and TransWeb would have undoubtedly suffered antitrust injury . TransWeb chose the second option . This prevented the harmful impacts to consumers of the relevant products but caused TransWeb to suffer a very real injury of its own , the cost of defending the suit . Both the lost profits suffered under option one and the attorney fees suffered under option two were attributable to what made 3M 's behavior unlawful , i.e. , bringing the lawsuit on a fraudulently-obtained patent in pursuit of a monopoly . Therefore , the injury suffered by TransWeb under either option qualifies as antitrust injury and thus can form the basis of damages under ¡± 4 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We are further persuaded to our conclusion by the multitude of regional circuit precedents finding that attorney fees incurred defending an anticompetitive lawsuit can form the basis for antitrust damages . See Premier Elec . Constr . Co. v. Nat ' l Elec . Contractors Ass ' n , 814 F.2d 358 , 371-76 ( 7th Cir.1987 ) ( permitting recovery of attorney fees for defending anticompetitive cartel suit even though sham litigation was not present ) ; Rickards v. Canine Eye Registration Found. , 783 F.2d 1329 , 1334-35 ( 9th Cir.1986 ) ( permitting recovery of attorney fees for defense of sham litigation ) ; CVD , Inc. v. Raytheon Co. , 769 F.2d 842 , 857-58 ( 1st Cir.1985 ) ( permitting recovery of attorney fees for defending bad faith assertion of trade secrets ) ; Handgards , Inc. v. Ethicon , Inc. , 743 F.2d 1282 , 1295-98 ( 9th Cir.1984 ) ( permitting recovery of attorney fees for defending bad faith prosecution of patent infringement suit ) ; Handgards , Inc. v. Ethicon , Inc. , 601 F.2d 986 , 996-97 ( 9th Cir.1979 ) ( same ) ; American Infra-Red Radiant Co. v. Lambert Indus. , 360 F.2d 977 , 996-97 ( 8th Cir.1966 ) ( permitting recovery of attorney fees when a patent suit is in furtherance of an illegal monopolistic scheme , though the suit itself may not be sham litigation ) ; Dairy Foods Inc. v. Dairy Maid Prods . Coop. , 297 F.2d 805 , 808-10 ( 7th Cir.1961 ) ( same ) ; Clapper v. Original Tractor Cab Co. , 270 F.2d 616 , 623-24 ( 7th Cir.1959 ) ( same ) ; Kobe , Inc. v. Dempsey Pump Co. , 198 F.2d 416 , 424-25 ( 10th Cir.1952 ) ( same ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 3M criticizes TransWeb 's reliance on cases such as Handgards that did not deal with Walker Process violations in particular . According to 3M , because some cases relied on by TransWeb dealt with sham litigation , the holdings are inapposite here . It is true that we have held that sham litigation and Walker Process are distinct avenues by which a party can lose Noerr-Pennington immunity . See Nobelpharma , 141 F.3d at 1071-72 . In Nobelpharma , we noted that the Supreme Court had declined to explain how sham litigation and Walker Process liability relate to one another , so we declined to merge the two doctrines . See id . ( discussing Prof ' l Real Estate Inv'rs , Inc. v. Columbia Pictures Indus. , Inc. , 508 U.S. 49 , 61 n. 6 , 113 S.Ct . 1920 , 123 L.Ed.2d 611 ( 1993 ) ( `` PRE `` ) ) . We reasoned that the objective baselessness and subjective bad faith requirements for sham litigation laid out in PRE are one way that a party can lose antitrust immunity , while the `` very specific conduct that is clearly reprehensible '' and defined in Walker Process is another way . Id . at 1071 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ But that distinction does not make the regional circuit cases dealing with sham litigation or other antitrust violations uninformative *1312 to the present issue of damages . While there are distinctions between the various types of antitrust violations , the logic underlying the award of attorney fees as antitrust damages is sufficiently similar to make those holdings relevant in the Walker Process context . In particular , it is the abuse of the legal process by the antitrust-defendant that makes the attorney fees incurred by the antitrust-plaintiff during that legal process a relevant antitrust injury . See Premier Electric , 814 F.2d at 375-76 ( explaining that fraud in litigation seeks to obtain more than authorized by the political branches and that `` litigation costs incurred to combat the consequences of acts exceeding the authorization granted by the political branches could be the basis of liability '' ) ; Handgards , 601 F.2d at 997 ( `` In a suit alleging antitrust injury based upon a bad faith prosecution theory it is obvious that the costs incurred in defense of the prior patent infringement suit are an injury which 'flows ' from the antitrust wrong. '' ) . Cf . PRE , 508 U.S. at 58 , 113 S.Ct . 1920 ( `` Indeed , we recognized that recourse to agencies and courts should not be condemned as sham until a reviewing court has discerned and drawn the difficult line separating objectively reasonable claims from a pattern of baseless , repetitive claims which leads the factfinder to conclude that the administrative and judicial processes have been abused . '' ( internal quotation marks and modifications omitted ) ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ No assertion of a patent known to be fraudulently-obtained can be a proper use of legal process . No successful outcome of that litigation , regardless of how much the patentee subjectively desires it , would save that suit from being improper due to its tainted origin . Therefore , we find the holdings of our sister circuits allowing attorney fees as antitrust damages in contexts such as sham litigation and lawsuits in furtherance of a broader anticompetitive scheme to be persuasive arguments in favor of allowing TransWeb to recover its attorney fees as ¡± 4 damages in this case . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ To conclude otherwise would be contrary to the purpose of the antitrust laws . The antitrust laws exist to protect competition . See Brown Shoe , 370 U.S. at 320 , 82 S.Ct . 1502 ( 1962 ) . If we were to hold that TransWeb can seek antitrust damages only under option one , forfeiture of competition , but not option two , defending the anticompetitive suit , then we would be incentivizing the former over the latter . This would amount to incentivizing TransWeb to forfeit competition rather than continue it . This is not in accord with the purpose of those very same antitrust laws . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Furthermore , it furthers the purpose of the antitrust laws to encourage TransWeb to bring its antitrust suit under option two instead of waiting to be excluded from the market under option one . If TransWeb proceeds only after being excluded from the market under option one , then the injury-in-fact will no longer be borne by TransWeb alone , but rather would be shared by all consumers in the relevant markets . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ For these reasons , we find that TransWeb 's attorney fees incurred defending the infringement suit are antitrust injury and thus can form the basis for damages under ¡± 4 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ VI _NEWLINE_ Based on the foregoing , we affirm the district court 's denial of JMOL on non-invalidity and on the antitrust counts , as well as the district court 's judgment of unenforceability due to inequitable conduct . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ AFFIRMED _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 812 F.3d 1295 , 2016-1 Trade Cases P 79,496 , 117 U.S.P.Q.2d 1617

See Streamfeeder , LLC v. Sure-Feed Sys. , Inc. , Civ . No . 97-03/RHK/FLN ( D.Minn . July 22 , 1998 ) . Because we conclude that the district court erred in adopting the jury 's finding of infringement , we reverse , and thus do not reach the other issues raised on appeal . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ BACKGROUND _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A . The Invention _NEWLINE_ The patent at issue involves devices known as `` bottom sheet feeders '' which collate paper and other thin materials for processing in a number of industrial applications , including mass mailing , printing , and binding . See U.S. Patent 5,601,282 , col. 1 , ll . 12-23 . Due to its widespread industrial application , bottom sheet feeder technology is a crowded art and is the subject of hundreds of patents . Streamfeeder is the assignee of U.S. Patent 4,991,831 , which is directed to a `` paper sheet feeding apparatus and , more particularly , to an apparatus for serially feeding flat sheets of paper from the bottom of a vertical stack of such sheets and so on to permit subsequent processing of each individual sheet . '' See '831 patent , col. 1 , ll . 5-9 . Independent claim 1 , the only such claim at issue , reads as follows : _NEWLINE_ 1 . An apparatus for serially feeding sheets in a forward direction from the bottom of a generally vertical stack of such sheets comprising : _NEWLINE_ *976 means for supporting the generally vertical stack of sheets and so that the stack defines a forward side composed of aligned forward edges of the sheets , and a bottom , said supporting means including endless belt means and means rotatably mounting said endless belt means so as to have an upper run positioned to extend across the bottom of said stack ; _NEWLINE_ drive means for rotating said endless belt so that said upper run moves in the forward direction ; and _NEWLINE_ means including a stationary gate forming member positioned above said upper run of said belt means and adjacent the forward side of said stack and so as to define a nip which forms a gap between said gate forming member and said upper run , for permitting the lowermost sheet of the stack to pass forwardly from the stack through said nip , said gate forming member including first surface means facing toward forward side of said stack so as to engage the forward edges of the sheets in the stack , and second surface means at said nip and having a coefficient of friction which is higher than that of said first surface means , and such that the lowermost sheet is free to pass through said nip without significant frictional resistance while the sheet immediately above the lowermost sheet is retarded in moving through said gap by its frictional engagement with said second surface means . _NEWLINE_ Id . at col. 7 , l. 48 to col. 8 , l. 10 . Dependent claim 2 more particularly claims a sheet feeding apparatus with a `` rear support member , '' see id . at col. 8 , ll . 11-20 , and dependent claim 8 more particularly claims a sheet feeding apparatus with a `` sensing means '' to monitor paper feeding , see id . at ll . 42-44 . Figure 4 of the '831 patent depicts the apparatus as follows : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *977 Fig . 4 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ? _NEWLINE_ The accused device is the commercial embodiment of U.S. Patent 5,601,282 , which is assigned to Sure-Feed . This embodiment is shown in Figure 1 of the '282 patent : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *978 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ? _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Fig . 1 _NEWLINE_ Both devices operate by taking a stack of paper , see '282 patent , fig . 1 at 25 , '831 patent , fig . 4 at S , and feeding the bottom-most sheet forward through the machine by way of `` endless belts '' upon which the stack of paper rests , see '282 patent , fig . 1 at 20 , '831 patent , fig . 4 at 30 . A `` gate '' prevents any additional sheets from traveling with the bottom-most sheet , thereby enabling the sheets to be processed one at a time . See '282 patent , fig . 1 at 24 , '831 patent , fig . 4 at 51 . The space between the belt and the gate through which the sheets individually pass is referred to as the `` nip . '' See '282 patent , fig . 1 ( not numbered ) , '831 patent , fig . 4 at 52 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The equivalency of the gate element of the accused device and the gate limitation in the claims is at the center of the dispute between the parties . The circular , stationary gate disclosed in Streamfeeder 's '831 patent is depicted in detail in Figure 5 : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *979 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ? _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Fig . 5 _NEWLINE_ Figure 5 indicates ( albeit not as clearly as might be desired ) that the circular gate has two surfaces , a surface facing the stack of papers ( Surface 1 ) and a surface at the nip ( Surface 2 ) . The written description describes the creation of these two surfaces in the following manner : _NEWLINE_ [ T ] he gate forming member comprises a generally cylindrical roll 51 [ with ] ... a plurality of annular grooves 58 extending about the circumference thereof ... . [ T ] he grooves are relatively deep along a first half of the peripheral surface of the roll [ Surface 1 ] , and relatively shallow along a second half of the peripheral surface [ Surface 2 ] ... . The roll 51 further includes a [ n ] [ O ] ring 62 disposed in each of the grooves , with the rings being composed of a material having a higher coefficient of friction than that of the material of the roll . _NEWLINE_ '831 patent , col. 4 , ll . 42-64 . Thus , the gate 's grooves , within which the O rings fit , are deeper on the side facing the stack of paper , such that the O rings are not exposed . This design creates Surface 1 , which is simply the acetal , metallic , or other smooth material of which the gate is constructed . See id . at col. 5 , ll . 10-11 , 14-15 . Surface 1 has a relatively low coefficient of friction ( £g ) associated with it , thus allowing the sheets in the stack to slide easily downward toward the nip . See id . at col. 7 , ll . 10-14 . At the nip , however , the grooves are raised , exposing the elastomeric or other material of which the O rings are fabricated . This design creates Surface 2 , which has a relatively high ( £g ) when compared with Surface 1 . The higher ( £g ) value prevents the sheet above the lowermost sheet from moving through the nip with the lowermost sheet , see id . at col. 7 , ll . 16-22 , i.e. , the sheets are prevented from `` double-feeding . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In contrast , the design of the pivotable gate of Sure-Feed 's device , see '282 patent , fig . 1 , differs in two main respects from the gate disclosed in the '831 patent : the Sure-Feed gate is elliptical and the grooves in which its O rings fit are of uniform depth . The '282 patent discloses that the elliptical design is meant to enhance the `` shingling '' of the sheets of paper , see id . at col. 1 , ll . 39-43 , whereby the sloping , elliptically shaped gate causes the sheets to move in a staggered fashion as they approach the nip , each sheet moving slightly further in the direction of feeding than the one above it . See id. , fig . 1 at 25 *980 ( illustrating shingling ) . Shingling enhances the separability of sheets as they are fed individually through the nip , a process which is particularly advantageous in cases where the sheets being fed are slick . See '831 patent , col. 7 , ll . 24-26 . As to the gate 's grooves , their uniform depth exposes the O rings equally across the surface of the ellipse , resulting in a gate with a uniformly high ( £g ) on all surfaces that come in contact with the sheets being fed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Streamfeeder alleged that in view of the uniformly high about the surface of the elliptical gate , a different factor is responsible for causing the sheets to feed individually in the Sure-Feed device , namely , differing normal forces . Normal force ( N ) is simply the force applied perpendicular to a surface ; here , according to Streamfeeder , a normal force is being applied by the elliptical gate to the sheets of paper with which it comes in contact . More specifically , Streamfeeder continues , the elliptical shape of the gate results in a higher N being applied by the gate 's surface at the nip when compared to the surface facing the paper . As a result , the sheets move readily down toward the nip but are prevented from double-feeding by the higher N at the nip . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B . The District Court _NEWLINE_ Streamfeeder sued Sure-Feed , alleging that Sure-Feed 's device infringes claims 1 , 2 , and 8 of the '831 patent under the doctrine of equivalents . Literal infringement was not alleged . The parties ' arguments focused on the accused device 's gate element , and specifically on whether that element functioned the same way as the gate limitation in the claims at issue . Streamfeeder contended that although the claimed gate employs surfaces with different ( £g ) values and the accused device 's gate employs surfaces with different N values , both gates prevent double-feeding in the same way via surfaces with different frictional force values . Streamfeeder based this argument on the equation _NEWLINE_ F = N ( £g ) _NEWLINE_ which relates frictional force ( F ) to normal force ( N ) and coefficient of friction ( £g ) . The equation reveals that an increase in either ( £g ) or N results in a proportional increase in F. Thus , Streamfeeder argued , the equation shows that Sure-Feed 's device , which varies N , functions in the same way as the claimed gate , which varies ( £g ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Sure-Feed moved for summary judgment of noninfringement . Focusing its arguments on claim 1 , Sure-feed asserted , inter alia , that if the claims were `` expanded '' under the doctrine of equivalents to read on the accused device , they would impermissibly read on the prior art .

David Geoffrey & Associates , 904 F.2d 677 , 14 U.S.P.Q.2d 1942 ( Fed.Cir.1990 ) , Streamfeeder responded by providing a hypothetical claim based on claim 1 . The court denied Sure-Feed 's motion , holding that `` Streamfeeder 's hypothetical claim does not 'ensnare the prior art ' and could have been allowed by the PTO . '' See Streamfeeder , LLC v. Sure-Feed Sys. , Inc. , Civ . No . 97-03/RHK/JMM , at 10 ( D.Minn . Apr . 17 , 1998 ) . The district court found that Streamfeeder 's proposed `` hypothetical claim could have been patentable and , therefore , there is no bar to the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the instant case . '' See id . The court further held that a genuine issue of fact existed as to whether the gate element of the accused device functions in the same way as the gate limitation in the claims at issue . See id . at 11 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Shortly thereafter , the court ruled on Streamfeeder 's seven motions in limine ; only Motion No . 1 is relevant here . In Motion No . 1 , Streamfeeder sought to exclude 195 of 203 prior art patents which were submitted by Sure-Feed under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 282 ( 1994 ) . The court granted the motion , concluding that , under the discovery rules of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure , the patents were disclosed in *981 an untimely fashion . See Streamfeeder , LLC v. Sure-Feed Sys. , Inc. , Civ . No . 97-03/RHK/JMM , at 1 ( D.Minn . May 19 , 1998 ) . This ruling became one of the bases for Sure-Feed 's motion for a new trial . See Def . 's Mem . in Supp . of Mot . for J. as a Matter of Law or , in the Alternative , a New Trial at 22-23 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The case was tried before a jury which found that Sure-Feed 's device infringed claims 1 , 2 , and 8 of the patent . In a subsequent order , the district court adopted the jury 's findings of fact and denied Sure-Feed 's JMOL/new trial motion . See Streamfeeder , LLC v. Sure-Feed Sys. , Inc. , Civ . No . 97-03/RHK/FLN , at 1-2 ( D.Minn . July 22 , 1998 ) . Sure-Feed appealed to this court . We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C . ¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( 1994 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ DISCUSSION _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A . Standards of Review _NEWLINE_ Infringement analysis is a two-step process . The first step is claim construction , which involves ascertaining the scope and meaning of the claims at issue , while the second step involves determining whether the claims as construed read on the accused device . See Personalized Media Communications , L.L.C . v. International Trade Comm ' n , 161 F.3d 696 , 702 , 48 U.S.P.Q.2d 1880 , 1885 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) . Claim construction is a question of law , while infringement , either literal or under the doctrine of equivalents , is a question of fact . See Bai v. L & L Wings , Inc. , 160 F.3d 1350 , 1353 , 48 U.S.P.Q.2d 1674 , 1676 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) . `` Hypothetical claim analysis '' is a methodology that may facilitate the determination whether an asserted scope of equivalents is permissible in view of the prior art . See Wilson , 904 F.2d at 677 , 14 U.S.P.Q.2d at 1942 . Determining whether the scope of equivalents accorded to a particular claim would encompass the prior art is an issue of law which we review de novo . See id . at 683 , 904 F.2d 677 , 14 U.S.P.Q.2d at 1948 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B . The Doctrine of Equivalents and Hypothetical Claim Analysis _NEWLINE_ Sure-Feed argues that the court erred in adopting Streamfeeder 's hypothetical claim because the scope of equivalents sought by Streamfeeder is prohibited by the prior art . Streamfeeder responds that Sure-Feed never asked the court to enter JMOL on this ground , thereby waiving this argument . Streamfeeder contends that even if this argument was not waived , Sure-Feed failed to carry its burden of showing that the scope of equivalents is prohibited by the prior art by merely showing that one of the limitations of the hypothetical claim is in the prior art . Sure-Feed replies that the burden is on the patentee to show that its asserted range of equivalents does not cover the prior art . Moreover , Sure-Feed argues that Streamfeeder improperly `` expanded '' one limitation and `` narrowed '' another limitation in constructing its hypothetical claim.1 We agree with Sure-Feed that the court erred in adopting Streamfeeder 's hypothetical claim , and we further conclude that a legally-acceptable hypothetical claim that would encompass Sure-Feed 's device would read on the prior art . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In Wilson , we set forth a hypothetical claim methodology to aid in determining whether a particular claim may be infringed under the doctrine of equivalents . See Wilson , 904 F.2d at 684 , 14 U.S.P.Q.2d at 1948 ; see also Key Mfg . Group , Inc. v. Microdot , Inc. , 925 F.2d 1444 , 1449 , 17 U.S.P.Q.2d 1806 , 1810 ( Fed.Cir.1991 ) . Under that methodology , the patentee may propose a hypothetical claim which is broad enough in scope to literally read on the accused device . See Wilson , 904 F.2d at 684 , 14 U.S.P.Q.2d at 1948 . If *982 the hypothetical claim could have been allowed by the Patent and Trademark Office ( PTO ) in view of the prior art , then the prior art does not preclude the application of the doctrine of equivalents and infringement may be found . See id . On the other hand , as in the PTO 's examination process , references may be combined to prove that the hypothetical claim would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art and thus would not have been allowed . See Key Mfg. , 925 F.2d at 1449 , 17 U.S.P.Q.2d at 1810 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Following the direction of Wilson , Streamfeeder presented the district court with a hypothetical claim in response to Sure-Feed 's motion for summary judgment of noninfringement . That claim , hypothetical claim 1 , is a modified version of original claim 1 , with additions indicated by underlining and deletions indicated by brackets : _NEWLINE_ 1 . An apparatus for serially feeding sheets in a forward direction from the bottom of a generally vertical stack of such sheets comprising : _NEWLINE_ means for supporting the generally vertical stack of sheets and so that the stack defines a forward side composed of aligned forward edges of the sheets , _NEWLINE_ and a bottom , said supporting means including endless belt means and means rotatably mounting said endless belt means so as to have an upper run positioned to extend across the bottom of said stack ; _NEWLINE_ drive means for rotating said endless belt so that said upper run moves in the forward direction ; and _NEWLINE_ means including a stationary gate forming member positioned above said upper run of said belt means and adjacent the forward side of said stack and so as to define a nip which forms a gap between said gate forming member and said upper run , for permitting the lowermost sheet of the stack to pass forwardly from the stack through said nip , said gate forming member comprising a cylindrical member having a plurality of annular grooves formed inwardly from a periphery thereof at regularly spaced intervals and with elastomeric bands disposed in said annular grooves and including first surface means facing toward forward side of said stack so as to engage the forward edges of the sheets in the stack , and second surface means at said nip [ and having a coefficient of friction which is higher than that of said first surface means ] , said plurality of elastomeric bands and said cylindrical member being arranged to present higher frictional resistance to the forward edges of the sheets at said second surface means than at said first surface means and such that the lowermost sheet is free to pass through said nip without significant frictional resistance while the sheet immediately above the lowermost sheet is retarded in moving through said gap by its frictional engagement with said second surface means . _NEWLINE_ See Streamfeeder 's Mem . of Law in Opp ' n to Def . 's Mot . for Summ . J. at 30 . Streamfeeder 's hypothetical claim is nearly identical to original claim 1 , except for two differences : first , the gate limitation has been narrowed to consist specifically of a cylindrical member containing elastomeric bands , and second , the limitation requiring two surfaces with two different coefficient of friction values has been broadened to recite two surfaces with two different frictional force values . Sure-Feed contends that by simultaneously broadening one limitation of original claim 1 and narrowing another Streamfeeder has in effect `` rewritten '' the claim . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Before proceeding further with the merits of the hypothetical claim analysis , we must first address the procedural question as to which party bears the burden of proving whether the hypothetical claim does or does not read on the prior art . Citing National Presto Industries , Inc. v. West Bend Co. , Streamfeeder contends that the burden rested on Sure-Feed to prove that the claim reads on the prior art . See National Presto Indus. , Inc. v. West *983 Bend Co. , 76 F.3d 1185 , 1192 , 37 U.S.P.Q.2d 1685 , 1689 ( Fed.Cir.1996 ) . In National Presto we stated : _NEWLINE_ When the patentee has made a prima facie case of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents , the burden of coming forward with evidence to show that the accused device is in the prior art is upon the accused infringer , not the trial judge . _NEWLINE_ National Presto , 76 F.3d at 1192 , 37 U.S.P.Q.2d at 1689 . Streamfeeder 's reliance on National Presto is misplaced , however , because while the burden of going forward rests with the accused infringer , the burden of persuasion that the hypothetical claim does not ensnare the prior art remains with the patentee : _NEWLINE_ In this context it is important to remember that the burden is on Wilson [ the patentee ] to prove that the range of equivalents which it seeks would not ensnare the prior art ... . The patent owner has always borne the burden of proving infringement , see Under Sea Indus. , Inc. v. Dacor Corp. , 833 F.2d 1551 , 1557 , 4 U.S.P.Q.2d 1772 , 1776 ( Fed.Cir.1987 ) , and there is no logical reason why that burden should shift to the accused infringer simply because infringement in this context might require inquiry into the patentability of a hypothetical claim . Any other approach would ignore the realities of what happens in the PTO and violate established patent law . _NEWLINE_ Wilson , 904 F.2d at 685 , 14 U.S.P.Q.2d 1948-49 . Thus , after the accused infringer satisfies its burden of going forward ( here , by presenting prior art which shows that the asserted range of equivalence would encompass the prior art ) , Wilson indicates that `` the burden to prove , '' i.e. , the burden of persuasion , rests on the patentee to show that its claim does not cover the prior art . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Turning to the merits , we agree with Sure-Feed and conclude that the district court erred as a matter of law in adopting Streamfeeder 's hypothetical claim , because such a claim impermissibly narrowed the gate member limitation . A hypothetical claim analysis is not an opportunity to freely redraft granted claims . That opportunity existed in the PTO , where the submitted claims were examined for patentability . Other statutorily prescribed procedures exist for post-grant modification of claims in the PTO in appropriate circumstances . See , e.g. , 35 U.S.C . ¡± 252 ( 1994 ) ( reissue ) ; 35 U.S.C . ¡± 307 ( 1994 ) ( reexamination ) . While use of a hypothetical claim may permit a minor extension of a claim to cover subject matter that is substantially equivalent to that literally claimed , one can not , in the course of litigation and outside of the PTO , cut and trim , expanding here , and narrowing there , to arrive at a claim that encompasses an accused device , but avoids the prior art . Slight broadening is permitted at that point , but not narrowing . See Jurgens v. McKasy , 927 F.2d 1552 , 1561 , 18 U.S.P.Q.2d 1031 , 1038 ( Fed.Cir.1991 ) ( `` [ I ] t may be helpful to 'conceptualize ' the prior art limitation on the doctrine of equivalents by envisioning a hypothetical patent claim-similar to the asserted claim but broad enough to literally cover the accused products-and testing whether that claim would have been patentable in view of the prior art . '' ) ( emphasis added ) . Wholesale redrafting of granted claims during litigation by narrowing and expanding the claims at the same time in creating a hypothetical claim is not supported by our case law and it avoids the examination process . It is contrary to the statutory requirement that an applicant `` particularly point [ ] out and distinctly claim [ ] the subject matter which the applicant regards as his [ or her ] invention , '' 35 U.S.C . ¡± 112 ( 1994 ) , a requirement that presupposes a PTO examination , which does not occur with a hypothetical claim . Hypothetical claim analysis thus can not be used to redraft granted claims in litigation by narrowing and broadening a claim at the same time . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ When one considers a permissible hypothetical claim in this case , i.e. , Streamfeeder 's hypothetical claim without the narrowed limitation , it is clear that the *984 hypothetical claim reads on the prior art ; Streamfeeder failed to satisfy its ultimate burden of persuasion to the contrary.2 Sure-Feed satisfied its burden of coming forward with evidence that the hypothetical claim reads on the prior art by presenting a number of prior art patents . U.S. Patent 4,715,593 ( Godlewski ) , in view of U.S. Patent 4,606,535 ( Larson ) , are the key patents , and we are satisfied that these references are sufficiently important , i.e. , significant to the bottom sheet feeder art , that those skilled in that art would have been motivated to combine them , see In re Rouffet , 149 F.3d 1350 , 1355-56 , 47 U.S.P.Q.2d 1453 , 1456 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) ( stating that motivation to combine references may come from `` the ordinary knowledge of those skilled in the art that certain references are of special importance in a particular field. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Sure-Feed correctly observes that Streamfeeder conceded that Godlewski contains all of the limitations of original claim 1 except for the `` endless belt means '' and the `` second surface means at said nip ... having a coefficient of friction that is higher than that of said first surface means . '' See Streamfeeder Resp . Br . at 14-15 . The endless belt means , however , is clearly disclosed in Larson . See '535 patent , col. 3 , l. 65 . As to the `` second surface means at said nip ... having a coefficient of friction that is higher than that of said first surface means '' limitation , this was broadened in the hypothetical claim by essentially replacing `` coefficient of friction '' with `` frictional resistance , '' i.e. , frictional force . This broadening encompasses Larson , which discloses a gate containing two surfaces which vary in normal force . See id . at ll . 40-50 . Thus , Sure-Feed successfully carried its burden of going forward by providing prior art which , by disclosing all of the limitations of the hypothetical claim , would have rendered it unpatentable . Streamfeeder , in contrast , failed to carry its burden of persuasion , simply arguing in various ways that Sure-Feed failed to carry its burden . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As a final matter , we must address whether to affirm the judgment with respect to dependent claims 2 and 8 on the ground that Sure-Feed failed to argue noninfringement of those claims in its briefing before this court or in its motion for summary judgment . Sure-Feed perhaps chose that strategy based on the axiomatic principle that if an accused infringer does not infringe an independent claim , it can not infringe claims that depend on that independent claim . See Wahpeton Canvas Co. , Inc. v. Frontier , Inc. , 870 F.2d 1546 , 1552 n. 9 , 10 U.S.P.Q.2d 1201 , 1208 n. 9 ( Fed.Cir.1989 ) . Streamfeeder agreed , stating in its summary judgment response : `` Streamfeeder contends that dependent claims 5 , 8 , 9 , and 11 [ sic , issued claims 2 and 8 ] are infringed , but agrees that defendants ' motion stands or falls based on whether a reasonable jury could find that claim 1 is infringed . '' See Streamfeeder 's Mem . of Law in Opp ' n to Def . 's Mot . for Summ . J. at 8 n. 3 . Thus , the parties staked the outcome regarding the dependent claims on the outcome of claim 1 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In Wilson , we noted a narrow , counterintuitive exception to the general principle that , when one does not infringe a broader *985 claim , one can not infringe a dependent claim containing all of that broader claim 's limitations plus more : _NEWLINE_ While this proposition is no doubt generally correct , it does not apply in the circumstances of this case . Here , we have reversed the judgment of infringement of independent claim 1 solely because the asserted range of equivalents of the claim limitations would encompass the prior art Uniroyal ball . The dependent claims , of course , are narrower than claim 1 ; therefore , it does not automatically follow that the ranges of equivalents of these narrower claims would encompass the prior art , because of their added limitations . _NEWLINE_ Wilson , 904 F.2d at 686 , 14 U.S.P.Q.2d at 1949 . Because Streamfeeder acknowledged in the district court that the dependent claims stand or fall with claim 1 , Streamfeeder can not now seek to sustain the judgment on claims 2 and 8 alone on the basis of that exception.3 We therefore reverse the judgment of infringement of claims 1 , 2 , and 8 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ CONCLUSION _NEWLINE_ The district court erred in adopting the jury 's finding of infringement of claim 1 , since the hypothetical claim proposed by Streamfeeder encompassing the accused device would not have been patentable over the Godlewski patent in view of the Larson patent . Furthermore , Streamfeeder can not seek to sustain judgment as to claims 2 and 8 , because it previously argued that these claims stand or fall with claim 1 . In view of these conclusions , we need not review the denial of Sure-Feed 's JMOL/new trial motion . Accordingly , we _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ REVERSE . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 175 F.3d 974 , 50 U.S.P.Q.2d 1515 _NEWLINE_ Footnotes _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In Wilson , we observed that the doctrine of equivalents does not `` expand '' or `` broaden '' claims , but instead expands the right to exclude . See Wilson , 904 F.2d at 684 , 14 U.S.P.Q.2d at 1948 . For convenience , however , we will utilize these terms , cognizant of the fact that it is the right to exclude which is being expanded , not the claims . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 2 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Streamfeeder urges that Sure-Feed raised its argument that the hypothetical claim encroaches upon the prior art only in its summary judgment motion but not in its JMOL motion , and that accordingly , this argument was waived . We do not agree . Because this is a procedural issue which is not unique to patent law , we must apply the law of the regional circuit in which the district court sits . See Engel Indus. , Inc. v. Lockformer Co. , 166 F.3d 1379 , 1384 , 49 U.S.P.Q.2d 1618 , 1622 ( Fed.Cir.1999 ) . Under Eighth Circuit law , Streamfeeder 's argument is clearly without merit . Sure-Feed raised this issue of law prior to the case going to the jury , so it was therefore unnecessary for it to have been raised subsequently in its JMOL motion . See Porous Media Corp. v. Pall Corp. , 110 F.3d 1329 , 1338 n. 12 ( 8th Cir.1997 ) ( `` [ T ] his legal question ... was preserved for appeal because it was argued to the district court before the case was submitted to the jury . '' ( citing Bottineau Farmers Elevator v. Woodward-Clyde Consultants , 963 F.2d 1064 , 1073 ( 8th Cir.1992 ) ( holding that issue of law raised in summary judgment motion was preserved for appeal despite not being reasserted in motions for directed verdict or JNOV ) ) ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 3 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Moreover , we note that even if Streamfeeder had asserted hypothetical claims for claims 2 and 8 , Sure-Feed would almost certainly have prevailed . The `` rear support member '' limitation of claim 2 is disclosed as a `` retainer bar '' in U.S. Patent 3,908,983 , see '983 patent , col. 2 , ll . 34-49 , and the sensor limitation in claim 11 is disclosed in Larson , see '535 patent , col. 5 , ll . 17-26 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_

Feil , 587 F.Supp . 1495 , 223 USPQ 961 ( S.D.N.Y.1984 ) , holding invalid all the claims of IPC 's Reissue Patent No . 31,144 entitled `` Multi Station Telephone Switching System '' , invention of Thomas E. Feil , for failure to meet the conditions for patent validity under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 , and dismissing IPC 's count for patent infringement . We hold that invalidity under ¡± 103 has not been proven , as a matter of law . We vacate the summary judgment of invalidity and dismissal of the infringement count , and remand to the district court . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Background _NEWLINE_ The claims of Reissue Patent No . 31,144 are for certain telephone systems known as `` trader turrets '' , which are multi-line telephone consoles used by the financial community in trading networks for securities , commodities , currency , and the like . The purpose of these systems is to facilitate concurrent telephone connections for traders requiring multiple sources of price information , conducting multiple transactions , and generally meeting the communication demands of busy , often hectic , financial trading enterprises . Trading rooms may house a hundred or more trader turrets . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Because of the large number of lines and connections required and the specific needs of these communication networks , these systems are complex . A high degree of reliability is required in their operation , because even momentary failures can be extremely costly . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The record shows that the Feil trader turrets rapidly achieved commercial success , displacing other systems then in use . IPC attributes the success of the Feil invention to its novel system `` architecture '' , which enabled ease of operation , high capacity , and improved reliability over the systems then available . IPC 's sales of the Feil trader turrets , according to the record , grew from $ 320,000 for 20 units in 1974 , its first year , to $ 27,900,000 for 3500 units in 1983 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Thomas Feil , the inventor , was formerly an officer and part owner of IPC . In 1977 Mr. Feil formed the defendant company V Band Systems , Inc. , and in 1980 Mr. Feil left IPC and joined V Band , of which he is president and chief executive officer . Defendants make and sell the trader turrets that are here accused of patent infringement . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On November 21 , 1980 IPC filed suit in the Southern District of New York asserting infringement of U.S. Patent No . 3,991,282 ( the '282 patent ) , invention of Thomas Feil . Defendants Feil and V Band raised the defense this patent was invalid in terms of 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 . IPC 's count for unfair competition was dismissed by the court and is not before us . Various counterclaims were separated and are apparently still pending . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In May of 1981 IPC filed in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ( the PTO ) an application to reissue the '282 patent . IPC cited to the examiner articles by M.E . Ozenberger and W.H . Keith , both of the Bell Telephone Laboratories , on which articles defendants were relying before the district court , and which had not previously been before the examiner . The district court refused to stay the action before it pending completion of the reissue examination , and therefore the reissue examination was suspended by the PTO in accordance with its rules . On defendants ' motion for summary judgment , the district court on June 1 , 1982 held all claims of the '282 patent invalid for obviousness under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 . Interconnect Planning Corp. v. Feil , 543 F.Supp . 610 , 614-19 , 215 USPQ 734 , 736-41 ( S.D.N.Y.1982 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Following this decision , at IPC 's request the PTO resumed examination of the reissue application . The court 's decision was provided to and considered by the examiner . *1135 A supplemental reissue declaration by IPC referred to this decision as a basis for the reissue application . The '282 patent was surrendered , and on February 8 , 1983 the PTO granted the reissue patent , RE 31,144 , IPC having restricted its claims in various ways and having overcome the newly cited prior art . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Defendants moved for summary judgment of invalidity of the reissue patent , asserting collateral estoppel based on the court 's decision on the '282 patent , and also asserting invalidity under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 . IPC resisted the motion , and the parties ' memoranda , affidavits , depositions , and other documents are of record . For reasons similar to those of the 1982 decision , the motion for summary judgment was granted on June 20 , 1984 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ That decision , holding all of the reissue claims invalid , was certified and made final under Fed.R.Civ.P . 54 ( b ) , with instructions by the court that IPC `` attempt to have any appeal ... heard at the same time and before the same panel '' as any appeal from a decision on the same patent by the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.1 We agreed . Both appeals are decided this day . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Although both appeals involved similar issues and argument , specific to the New York suit are certain procedural issues , as discussed infra . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Collateral Estoppel _NEWLINE_ Defendants argue that IPC 's appeal rights are curtailed on the basis of collateral estoppel . Two separate but related issues of estoppel are raised , both arising out of the district court 's 1982 decision on the '282 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A . _NEWLINE_ Defendants assert first that IPC can not now appeal from or argue those aspects of the 1984 decision on the reissue patent which are `` common to '' the 1982 decision on the '282 patent , on the ground that those aspects could have been appealed earlier , and that it is too late to do so now . IPC asserts in response that ( 1 ) the issues are not the same , ( 2 ) a different patent is involved , and ( 3 ) the 1982 decision was not final . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Considering the finality issue , for collateral estoppel to arise the prior decision need not have been final in the sense of 28 U.S.C . ¡± 1291 but , in the words of the Restatement , the prior adjudication must have been `` sufficiently firm to be accorded conclusive effect '' . Restatement ( Second ) of Judgments ¡± 13 ( 1982 ) . Sufficient firmness , according to the Restatement , requires that the party against whom the estoppel is asserted have had the right , even if not exercised , to challenge on appeal the correctness of the earlier decision . Restatement ( Second ) of Judgment , ¡± 13 reporter 's note comment f ( 1982 ) . Defendants argue that IPC had three such opportunities : appeal under 28 U.S.C . ¡± 1292 ( a ) ( 1 ) , which governs appeals from interlocutory orders involving injunctions ; appeal under 28 U.S.C . ¡± 1292 ( c ) ( 2 ) , which governs appeals in patent infringement cases final except for an accounting ; and appeal under Fed.R.Civ.P . 54 ( b ) , which governs judgment on fewer than all of multiple claims in an action . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ None of these situations controls the case before us . 28 U.S.C . ¡± 1292 ( a ) ( 1 ) relates to orders involving injunctions , and although defendants argue that IPC 's complaint necessarily invokes this section , this does not impart automatic appealability to interlocutory orders that do not involve injunctions . As for 28 U.S.C . ¡± 1292 ( c ) ( 2 ) , the district court 's judgment was not final except for an accounting , in light of the pendency of counterclaims . 9 J. Moore , B . Ward , & J. Lucas , Moore 's Federal Practice , ? 110.19 [ 4 ] , at 220 ( 1985 ) . Fed.R.Civ.Proc . 54 ( b ) requires that the court have expressly directed entry of a final judgment , and that `` [ i ] n the absence of such determination and direction , any [ decision ] which adjudicates fewer than all the claims *1136 ... shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims '' . See also 6 Moore 's Federal Practice ? 54.42 , at 813 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Neither IPC nor the defendants asked the district court to enter a final judgment on its decision holding the '282 patent invalid , and the court did not do so . Defendants assert , however , that IPC should now be estopped because it did not move for finality of the ruling nor request that the judgment be certified for interlocutory appeal . An application for certification is by no means certain to be granted and , in this case , IPC 's eventual request for certification of the original decision was opposed by defendants and was refused by the court . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The law of collateral estoppel is not intended to penalize a party for declining to try to take a piecemeal appeal . Further , the '282 patent had been placed in reissue , and an appeal on the merits of patent claims for which reissue was being sought would have been a meaningless exercise , as may have been recognized at the time . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We conclude that the district court 's 1982 decision on the '282 patent claims , a decision not final , not certified , not appealed , and mooted by subsequent events , lacks collateral estoppel effect for the purpose urged by defendants . The issue here on appeal is the validity of the claims of the reissue patent , an issue that did not exist at the time of the decision on validity of the '282 patent claims . There is no estoppel against appellate review of all aspects pertinent to the decision on the reissue claims . 1B Moore 's Federal Practice ? 0.441 [ 3.-3 ] , at 737 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B . _NEWLINE_ IPC asserts that the district court incorrectly invoked collateral estoppel when it analyzed the reissue claims by comparing them with the original claims of the '282 patent , then applying prior art only to the differences between the reissue claims and the original claims . Our predecessor court , the U.S. Court of Claims,2 has confronted related situations , wherein estoppel was raised as to unadjudicated claims of a patent whose other claims had been adjudicated in an earlier action . The Court of Claims adopted a pragmatic approach , stating that the first step was to determine whether any new issues were raised as to the nonlitigated claims . In Westwood Chemical , Inc. v. United States , 525 F.2d 1367 , 1375 , 207 Ct.Cl . 791 , 187 USPQ 656 ( 1975 ) , adopting 186 USPQ 383 , 389 ( Ct.Cl.Tr.Div.1975 ) , the court said : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Where obviousness is the basis for the prior invalidity holding , an inquiry into the identity of the validity issue is more properly phrased in terms of the factual inquiries mandated by Graham v. John Deere Co. , 383 U.S. 1 , 17 , 86 S.Ct . 684 , 15 L.Ed.2d 545 ( 1966 ) , as a prerequisite to such a validity determination . _NEWLINE_ Applying the Graham guidelines , the court said : _NEWLINE_ Thus , the inquiry should be whether the nonlitigated claims present new issues as to the art pertinent to the nonlitigated claims ; as to the scope and content of that art ; as to the differences between the prior art and the nonlitigated claims ; and as to the level of ordinary skill in that art . If none of these inquiries raises any new triable issues , then the obviousness determination in the prior proceeding should be equally applicable to the nonlitigated claims . _NEWLINE_ Id . See also Bourns , Inc. v. United States , 537 F.2d 486 , 210 Ct.Cl . 642 , 199 USPQ 256 ( 1976 ) , adopting 187 USPQ 174 ( Ct.Cl.Tr.Div.1975 ) ; Carter-Wallace , Inc. v. United States , 496 F.2d 535 , 538 , 204 Ct.Cl . 341 , 182 USPQ 172 , 175 ( 1974 ) ( in determining the applicability of the estoppel , the first consideration is `` whether the issue of invalidity common to each action is substantially identical. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ The question of substantial identity of reissue claims arose in Plastic Container Corp. v. Continental Plastics of Oklahoma , *1137 Inc. , 607 F.2d 885 , 203 USPQ 27 ( 10th Cir.1979 ) , cert . denied , 444 U.S. 1018 , 100 S.Ct . 672 , 62 L.Ed.2d 648 , 204 USPQ 696 ( 1980 ) , wherein the court determined that the reissue claims were not substantially identical to the original claims , and therefore that collateral estoppel did not apply . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In Bourns , responding to plaintiff 's argument that according collateral estoppel effect to non-identical adjudicated claims would amount to treating the claims previously held to be invalid as prior art , the court agreed that this would be inappropriate : _NEWLINE_ A domino approach in which each successively narrower claim is compared with the one before it , not with the prior art , is inappropriate since it improperly gives prior-art effect to the subject matter of an invalid claim . In re Craig and Street , Cust . & Pat.App. , 411 F.2d 1333 , 1335 ( 1969 ) . _NEWLINE_ 537 F.2d at 493 , 187 USPQ at 179 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court compared the reissue claims with the '282 claims , and erroneously concluded that reissue claims 1 through 6 were substantially identical to the original claims , and that reissue claims 7 through 9 , although not substantially identical , involved some substantially identical `` issues '' . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This erroneous legal conclusion may have compounded the error in the next step , wherein the court compared the differences between the original and the reissue claims with prior art that was pertinent only to those differences , thus effectively giving the original claims prior art effect-the pitfall against which Bourns cautioned : _NEWLINE_ A claim may be invalid for obviousness under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 but still describe a combination not found in the prior art . Moreover , it is well settled that each claim of a patent is entitled to a presumption of validity and is to be treated as a complete and independent invention . 35 U.S.C . ¡±¡± 282 , 288 .

Hughes Tool Co. , 396 F.2d 735 , 736 ( 5th Cir.1968 ) . _NEWLINE_ Id . When a patent has been reissued with claims that are not substantially identical to the original claims , the invention as a whole , as now claimed , must be evaluated in terms of 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 . The original claims , whether valid or invalid , are not prior art against the reissued claims . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Summary Judgment _NEWLINE_ The proceeding from which this appeal is taken was styled `` summary '' , in that the court 's decision was made on defendants ' motion for summary judgment . The earlier decision on the '282 patent was also made on defendants ' motion for summary judgment . IPC contends that the matter was inappropriate to summary judgment , in view of the presence of disputed issues of material fact . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Defendants Feil and V Band argued before the district court , and repeat before us , that no material fact is in dispute , that the questions before the district court and before us in this appeal are purely legal ones , and that the issue was properly dealt with summarily . In its discussion of reissue claims 7 through 9 , which claims had no counterpart in the original patent , the district court referred to `` claims and issues that have not yet been subjected to a full and fair adjudication '' , 587 F.Supp . at 1500 , 223 USPQ at 965 ; the court viewed both proceedings as `` full '' as well as fair , a process not always accomodated by summary proceedings on a documentary record . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Obviousness vel non under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 is a question of law , whose conclusion requires preliminary determination of several underlying factual issues , as set out in Graham v. John Deere Co. , 338 U.S. 1 , 69 S.Ct . 1434 , 93 L.Ed . 1765 , 148 USPQ 459 ( 1966 ) . See also Gardner v. TEC Systems , Inc. 725 F.2d 1338 , 1344-45 , 220 USPQ 777 , 782-83 ( Fed.Cir . ) ( in banc ) , cert . denied , 105 S.Ct . 116 , 105 S.Ct . 116 , 83 L.Ed.2d 60 , 225 USPQ 232 ( 1984 ) . These factual issues relate to the scope and *1138 content of the prior art , the differences between the prior art and the claimed invention as a whole , the level of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made , and the so-called `` secondary considerations '' that reflect the contemporaneous response to the invention . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In reviewing IPC 's assertions that there were genuine issues of material fact relating to the Graham inquiries , we have reviewed the submissions of the parties . Before the court , according to the record , were all the references cited as prior art ; as well as the depositions of Examiner Randall P. Myers of the United States Patent and Trademark Office , engineer John Fitzmaurice of New York Telephone , and inventor/defendant Thomas E. Feil ; and various documentary exhibits . Also of record were the affidavits of Alan R. Fitzpatrick , president of American Telecommunications Concepts ; IPC 's technical experts Dennis Maywald and Herbert Goldwag ; Thomas P. Bradbury , vice president and treasurer of IPC ; and extensive written submissions and arguments . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Although fact and opinion are intertwined in many of these documents , the factual considerations required by the Graham analysis appear to have been adequately presented in the record . The technological structure and operation of the devices of the prior art were not in material dispute,3 although there was strong dispute about the relationship of the teachings of the references to the problems solved by the Feil system , and the weight to be given to evidence of the Feil invention 's commercial success . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court stated that expert testimony was unnecessary , Interconnect Planning Corp. v. Feil , 587 F.2d at 1497 , 223 USPQ at 963 , and held all of the reissue claims invalid . As will be discussed , we think that the district court reached this conclusion by incorrectly applying the law of 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 _NEWLINE_ Those charged with determining compliance with 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 are required to place themselves in the minds of those of ordinary skill in the relevant art at the time the invention was made , to determine whether that which is now plainly at hand would have been obvious at such earlier time . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The invention must be viewed not with the blueprint drawn by the inventor , but in the state of the art that existed at the time . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The invention must be evaluated not through the eyes of the inventor , who may have been of exceptional skill , but as by one of `` ordinary skill '' . See Stewart-Warner Corp. v. City of Pontiac , Michigan , 767 F.2d 1563 , 1570 , 226 USPQ 676 , 680-81 ( Fed.Cir.1985 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This is not a facile statutory interpretation . The quality of non-obviousness is not easy to measure , particularly when challenged years after the invention was made . That which may be made clear and thus `` obvious '' to a court , with the invention fully diagrammed and aided , in this case , by a hostile inventor seeking to eliminate his own invention , may have been a breakthrough of substantial dimension when first unveiled . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The judicial application of uniform standards for determining compliance with 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 is essential , because the technological incentives fostered by the patent system depend on consistent interpretation of the law . To this end , faithful adherence to the patent statute and guiding precedent fosters uniformity in result . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1139 A . _NEWLINE_ Following examination by the Patent and Trademark Office , a duly issued patent is presumed valid , as is a duly reissued patent . The burden of proving otherwise resides with the person challenging its validity . 35 U.S.C . ¡± 282 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This statutory presumption derives in part from recognition of the technological expertise of the patent examiners . A reissue application receives a fresh examination , normally concentrated on those references and reasons that occasioned its filing . The record shows that this reissue application received a supplemental internal review by three examiners because it was involved in litigation . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Although IPC 's view is incorrect that the PTO 's decision must be given controlling weight , we do agree that the examination procedure and result should be given appropriate consideration and due weight by the court . As stated in Fromson v. Advance Offset Plate , Inc. , 755 F.2d 1549 , 1555 , 225 USPQ 26 , 31 ( Fed.Cir.1985 ) , `` [ t ] he Examiner 's decision , on an original or reissue application , is never binding on the court . It is , however , evidence the court must consider in determining whether the party asserting invalidity has met its statutory burden by clear and convincing evidence '' . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Upon reissue the `` burden of proving invalidity was made heavier '' , as stated in Fromson , supra . This burden must be met by the party asserting invalidity . The district court here relied on the identical references that had been before the reissue examiners , and disdaining the need for expert testimony , reached a different conclusion in law . Although we affirm the obligation of the district court to reach an independent conclusion , the reissue patent reaches the court clothed in a statutory presumption of validity , and clear and convincing evidence is required to surmount this presumption . American Hoist & Derrick Co. v. Sowa & Sons , Inc. , 725 F.2d 1350 , 1359-60 , 220 USPQ 763 , 770 ( Fed.Cir . ) , cert . denied , 469 U.S. 821 , 105 S.Ct . 95 , 83 L.Ed.2d 41 , 224 USPQ 520 ( 1984 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B . _NEWLINE_ The court referred to the content of the prior art references in broad terms , occasionally using the title of a reference to explain its pertinence . In this crowded art of telephone systems , as IPC correctly pointed out , it is not enough to show that each of the components used by Feil was known , and had been used in other telephone systems . Feil did not claim to have invented any of the components of his claimed system . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ From its discussion of the prior art it appears to us that the court , guided by the defendants , treated each reference as teaching one or more of the specific components for use in the Feil system , although the Feil system did not then exist . Thus the court reconstructed the Feil system , using the blueprint of the Feil claims . As is well established , this is legal error . Kalman v. Kimberly-Clark Corp. , 713 F.2d 760 , 774 , 218 USPQ 781 , 791 ( Fed.Cir.1983 ) , cert . denied , 465 U.S. 1026 , 104 S.Ct . 1284 , 79 L.Ed.2d 687 , 224 USPQ 520 ( 1984 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Illustrative is the court 's analysis of reissue claim 1 . Pertinent is not only its analysis of the differences between the reissue claim and the prior art , but also the differences between the reissue claim and the original claim . In claim 1 , matter enclosed in brackets appeared in the original claim but forms no part of the reissue claim , and matter printed in italics was added by reissue : _NEWLINE_ 1 . For a telephone system in which telephone communication is capable of being established for each telephone station of a plurality of telephone stations over a standard telephone line by directly connecting each telephone station to a selected standard telephone line of a plurality of standard telephone lines , each of said plurality of standard telephone lines capable of being directly connected to each of said plurality of telephone stations , an improvement comprising : _NEWLINE_ a plurality of pairs of contacts , with respective pairs of said contacts being *1140 connected with respective ones of said standard telephone lines for allowing said communication ; _NEWLINE_ a plurality of relay coils , with respective ones of said relay coils controlling respective pairs of said contacts to be opened or closed ; _NEWLINE_ a plurality of sets of non-locking pushbutton [ switch means ] switches with each set of pushbutton [ switch means ] switches connected to respective ones of said telephone stations with respective ones of said pushbutton [ switch means ] switches of said sets of pushbutton [ switch means ] switches corresponding to respective ones of said standard telephone lines and being connected with respective ones of said relay coils and being depressed for energizing a selected one of said relay coils for closing a corresponding pair of contacts to allow said telephone communication ; [ and ] _NEWLINE_ an electronic holding circuit for each of said relay coils , said holding circuits being operative _NEWLINE_ to establish a held state after initial energization of the associated relay coil by momentarily depressing the associated pushbutton switch , and _NEWLINE_ to maintain said corresponding pair of contacts closed while in the held state ; _NEWLINE_ a logic circuit for each station connected to said holding circuits to detect conditions for releasing the held state ; _NEWLINE_ each of said stations comprising [ first light display means ] a set of status lights , connection means connecting corresponding pushbuttons of said sets of pushbutton [ switch means ] switches in each of said stations and to said [ first light display means ] status lights for energizing said [ first light display means ] status lights in each station to display the status of each of said plurality of standard telephone lines in each of said stations , _NEWLINE_ said station further comprising [ first light display means ] an active line indicator separate from said status lights connected to said pushbutton [ switch means ] switches for identifying the standard telephone line of said plurality of standard telephone lines that the telephone station is using for said telephone communication . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Reissue claim 1 was held invalid on two grounds . The first ground was that it was substantially identical to claim 1 of the '282 patent , and thus invalid on the basis of collateral estoppel . The court in its 1982 decision referred to Carter U.S. Patent No . 3,150,238 and Foulkes U.S. Patent No . 3,757,056 as disclosing `` non-locking buttons , relay coils and pairs of contacts '' as applied to the original claim 1 . In the 1984 decision the court stated that `` Claim 1 has not been changed in such a way that alters the above finding of disclosure by prior art '' . 587 F.Supp . at 1499 , 223 USPQ at 964 . This treatment of the reissue claim is not supported by the claim content , as will be apparent from the court 's further discussion of claim 1 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As the second ground for its holding of invalidity the court analyzed the changes made by reissue . The court identified three areas as new to reissue claim 1 , and applied five references to these areas as follows : `` See Defendants ' Exhs . C13 , D4-D6 ( non-locking buttons ) ; Defendants ' Exhs . C4 , C7 ( holding circuits ) ; Defendants ' Exhs . C16 , C13 ( separate active lines ) . '' Id . at 1499 , 223 USPQ at 964 ( footnotes omitted ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The first set of cited exhibits refers to articles by Keith , `` A New Switching System for 'Right of Way ' Companies '' , Bell Laboratories Record , Apr . 1968 , and Ozenberger , `` Voice Communication System for Air Traffic Control '' , Bell Laboratories Record , May 1961 , which the court stated taught the use of non-locking pushbuttons . The second set refers to the Carter patent , which the district court said teaches a `` Relay Control Circuit '' ( the title of the Carter patent ) , and the Foulkes patent which `` recites that ' [ e ] ach of these [ control ] circuits may take any desired and presently known form ... to perform a recognized control *1141 function ... evaluat [ ing ] the 'hold ' feature ' `` . Id . at 1499 n. 6 , 223 USPQ at 946 n. 6 . The third set of exhibits refers to Simon U.S. Patent No . 3,928,732 , which the district court described by its title , `` Extension and Line Indicating Display System for Key Telephone System '' , and Keith , which the district court stated `` also discloses separate active lines '' . Id . at 1499 n. 7 , 223 USPQ at 964 n. 7 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The court 's analysis of the scope of the new material in reissue claim 1 in itself shows the error in the court 's conclusion that as a matter of law reissue claim 1 is substantially identical to its parent claim . The claim limitations of the electronic holding circuits for each relay coil , the logic circuit , and separate active line indicator , in combination with the non-locking pushbutton switches connected to the relay coils , were added by reissue . Observing these differences , their relationship to the invention as a whole , and the prior art , we conclude as a matter of law that reissue claim 1 is not substantially identical to the original claim . The 1982 decision , which was directed to the original claims , does not apply to the reissue claims . Collateral estoppel as a basis for the court 's holding of invalidity is not supported in law . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Having determined that a reissue claim is not substantially identical to the parent , the parent claim is of no further moment . As stated in Wayne-Gossard Corp. v. Moretz Hosiery Mills , Inc. , 539 F.2d 986 , 991 , 191 USPQ 543 , 546-47 ( 4th Cir.1976 ) , `` the original claim was at an end , denuded of all potency save as a bench mark of interpretation , at the time of the reissue 's infringement . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The original claim is not prior art against the reissue claim . It is not correct to weigh the reissue claim against the original claim . It is not correct to weigh the changes in the reissue claim against the original claim . It is the reissue claim alone that is to be analyzed in accordance with the Graham guidelines , and the differences to be considered are the differences between the reissue claim as a whole and the prior art . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In the court 's 1982 analysis of the original claims , to which the court referred in its 1984 decision , the court had identified `` six principal features which plaintiff argues are not obvious '' and explained why the court concluded that these features are obvious by referring to various prior art references showing various of the features in various contexts . Interconnect Planning Corp. v. Feil , 543 F.Supp . at 617 , 215 USPQ at 739 . As we have observed , it is the emphasis on the obviousness of `` features '' , rather than the claimed telephone system as a whole , that constitutes the flaw in the application of section 103 to the Feil claims . As stated in In re Shuman , 361 F.2d 1008 , 1012 , 150 USPQ 54 , 57 ( CCPA 1966 ) : _NEWLINE_ It is impermissible to first ascertain factually what appellants did and then view the prior art in such a manner as to select from the random facts of that art only those which may be modified and then utilized to reconstruct appellants ' invention from such prior art . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The court in 1982 summarized its conclusion with respect to these six `` features '' by observing ( 1 ) that although the pairs of contacts and relay coils `` is not disclosed in either the Keith Article or the Ozenberger Article '' , the Foulkes and Carter patents do disclose them ; ( 2 ) that Keith , Ozenberger , and Foulkes refer to pushbutton switches ; ( 3 ) that Keith shows a set of display lamps although Ozenberger uses a single lamp , and that Paraskevakos ( U.S. Patent No . 3,727,003 ) and Simon et al . show either a digital display or the incoming line number ; ( 4 ) that Paraskevakos shows a decoder and that `` the diode matrix was no mystery to one engineer '' ( Thomas Fitzmaurice , of Bell Labs , who testified that he readily understood the Feil system after he was shown it ) ; ( 5 ) that Keith shows which lines are active ; and ( 6 ) that the asserted unique master station hook up with blocking means is shown in Ozenberger and a Verdon patent ( U.S. Patent No . 3,819,871 ) . Interconnect Planning Corp. v. Feil , 543 F.Supp . at 617-19 , 215 USPQ at 739-40 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1142 In its 1984 decision the court added the additional citations of references pertinent to the changes in the reissue claims , as discussed above . As in its citation of references against the various features of the original claims , the court selected from each reference a feature or features that also appeared in the reissue claims . No reference , however , suggested the overall arrangement , the `` architecture '' , of the Feil system . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ IPC presented affidavit testimony explaining the references in the context of the state of the telephone systems art at the time , none of which testimony was controverted other than by attorney argument . The most advanced multi-line devices at the time the invention was made , according to this record , used the then state-of-the-art crossbar switching equipment , and electrical or mechanical interconnections or interlocks . The two Bell Labs publications of Keith and Ozenberger , on which defendants and the district court placed substantial emphasis , used crossbar switching . Feil did not . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Mr. Feil 's affidavit filed with the district court states `` The Ozenberger and Keith articles disclose what I thought I invented in 1974 '' . Mr. Feil made no reference to the crossbar switches required by these references , and offered no discussion of either differences or similarities between his system and those of these references . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Carter patent used relay switches in the telephone switching system it describes . Carter , of Bell Laboratories , taught the use of quick-release control relays in combination with slow-release work relays , to achieve the specific purposes desired by Carter . Carter also required use of a `` locking chain '' rather than independently operating relays , and a more complex communication path as compared with Feil 's direct connections . Feil established multiple direct connections in a system where theretofore it was believed , according to the record , that crossbar switches would be required . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Feil system eliminated both crossbar switches and mechanical interlocks or mechanically locking pushbuttons , and instead used relays , a well-known type of switch . But Feil avoided the need ( of Carter ) to establish potentially large numbers of contacts and operate a concomitantly large number of relays in series in order to connect stations within the system . As IPC 's uncontroverted testimony shows , Feil avoided interconnections and interlocks , both of which , according to the Maywald affidavit , had previously been considered necessary to lock out faults . The Maywald affidavit stated that Carter 's approach would be `` impossible and impractical '' in the trader turret application because `` [ t ] o try and accurately control the release times of different relays over a long period of time would be virtually impossible considering the wear and deterioration of components '' in a `` trader turret network involving some 20,000 or more relays '' . Maywald 's explanation of the technical operation of the references is uncontradicted , although defendants take issue in attorney argument with Maywald 's conclusions . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Foulkes patent , on which the district court also relies , described a `` bipolar multiplexing circuit '' based on a `` contact tree '' relay switching arrangement . Foulkes taught a telephone system that Maywald avers , without contradiction , `` could not be realistically expanded into large systems like trader turrets '' . The district court did not explain how the Foulkes or other systems of different circuitry made obvious the different system of Feil 's claims . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Keith and Ozenberger systems , as previously discussed , are different systems from that of Feil . Like the systems of the other references , they contain some elements in common with that of Feil . The Ozenberger system , based on crossbar switches , was designed for air traffic control . The Keith system is described as tailored to the specific needs of `` right-of-way '' companies , and is a cordless system limited to up to eight consoles of up to a hundred lines . As Keith says , `` [ a ] system of crossbar switches is the heart of the switching system '' . Neither Keith nor Ozenberger suggests that the crossbars be *1143 replaced with relays and that the other changes be made to produce the admittedly different Feil system . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The novelty of the Feil system is not controverted by the defendants . Its value in trader turret systems has received the ultimate recognition , market success and imitation . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 requires that obviousness be determined with respect to the invention as a whole . See , e.g. , Jones v. Hardy , 727 F.2d 1524 , 1528 , 220 USPQ 1021 , 1024 ( Fed.Cir.1984 ) ; W.L . Gore & Assocs. , Inc. v. Garlock , Inc. , 721 F.2d 1540 , 1548 , 220 USPQ 303 , 309 ( Fed.Cir.1983 ) , cert . denied , 105 S.Ct . 172 ( 1984 ) ; Stratoflex , Inc. v. Aeroquip Corp. , 713 F.2d 1530 , 1537 , 218 USPQ 871 , 877 ( Fed.Cir.1983 ) . This is essential for combination inventions , for generally all combinations are of known elements . Environmental Designs , Ltd. v. Union Oil Co. of California , 713 F.2d 693 , 698 , 218 USPQ 865 , 870 ( Fed.Cir.1983 ) , cert . denied , 464 U.S. 1043 , 104 S.Ct . 709 , 79 L.Ed.2d 173 , 224 USPQ 520 ( 1984 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ When prior art references require selective combination by the court to render obvious a subsequent invention , there must be some reason for the combination other than the hindsight gleaned from the invention itself . ACS Hospital Systems , Inc. v. Montefiore Hospital , 732 F.2d 1572 , 1577 & n. 14 , 221 USPQ 929 , 933 & n. 14 ( Fed.Cir.1984 ) . There must be `` something in the prior art as a whole to suggest the desirability , and thus the obviousness , of making the combination '' . Lindemann Maschinenfabrik GmbH v. American Hoist and Derrick Co. , 730 F.2d 1452 , 1462 , 221 USPQ 481 , 488 ( Fed.Cir.1984 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Critical to the analysis is an understanding of the particular results achieved by the new combination . The claims here at issue are directed to a combination of known components of telephone systems in an admittedly new way to achieve a new total system . Neither the district court in its opinion , nor the defendants , identified any suggestion in the prior art that the components be combined as they were by Feil or that such combination could achieve the advantages of the Feil system . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Not only must the claimed invention as a whole be evaluated , but so also must the references as a whole , so that their teachings are applied in the context of their significance to a technician at the time-a technician without our knowledge of the solution . The defendants propounded and the district court appears to have followed an analytical method that well illustrates the `` mosaic '' analogy discussed in W.L . Gore & Assocs. , 721 F.2d at 1552 , 220 USPQ at 312 , where this court said : _NEWLINE_ [ T ] he claims were used as a frame , and individual , naked parts of separate prior art references were employed as a mosaic to recreate a facsimile of the claimed invention . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Defendants refer to the decision of the Supreme Court in Sakraida v. Ag Pro , Inc. , 425 U.S. 273 , 96 S.Ct . 1532 , 47 L.Ed.2d 784 , 189 USPQ 449 ( 1976 ) . As the Court there held , Sakraida 's combination of old elements to wash barn floors with flowing water did not produce a new or different function , and affirmed the district court 's holding that `` 'all of the elements of [ the combination ] are old ... and the combination of them ... being neither new nor meeting the test of non-obviousness . ' `` Id . at 274 , 96 S.Ct . 1533-34 , 189 USPQ at 450 . In the Feil invention the combination was admittedly new , and it produced a new system having theretofore unavailable attributes . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Recognizing the difficulty of casting one 's mind back to the state of technology at the time the invention was made , courts have long recognized the usefulness of evidence of the contemporaneous attitude toward the asserted invention . A retrospective view of the invention is best gleaned from those who were there at the time . Mr. Feil , the inventor impugning his own invention , now avers that he did no more than did the prior art , specifically the Keith and Ozenberger articles . Mr. Feil 's disavowal of his invention is staunch , although he less modestly commented in 1977 , before *1144 he left IPC , on the reaction of Bell Labs ' engineer at that earlier time : _NEWLINE_ He [ Fitzmaurice ] showed too much enthusiasm . I mean , he was really excited by the thing . Like this is incredible . You guys are geniuses . You 're 50 miles ahead of Bell Labs . ( App.Vol . VI , F357 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ? ? _NEWLINE_ ? _NEWLINE_ You know what he said . He said You 're 50 miles ahead of Bell Lab ? He said `` miles '' , not years , he made it in miles . You 're 50 miles ahead of the Bell Labs . ( App.Vol . VI , F355 ) . _NEWLINE_ Mr. Elia of the Republic Bank , one of IPC 's customers , attested : _NEWLINE_ Upon viewing the equipment , the AT & T people indicated that it was unbelievable . They did not think it could be done . They were surprised that it was done . ( App.Vol . VI , F360 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Although the district court remarked in its 1982 decision that evidence of commercial success `` can not be afforded any weight '' `` in light of my finding of obviousness '' , 543 F.2d at 619 , 215 USPQ at 741 , such evidence when present must be considered and afforded appropriate weight .

It is not pertinent that the invention was easily understood after it was made-a factor that appears to have been considered significant by the district court , see 543 F.Supp . at 619 , 215 USPQ at 741-but whether it would have been obvious to make the invention at the time . Giving due weight to the market success and contemporaneous reaction to the Feil trader turret system , the record does not contain clear and convincing evidence that the Feil invention of the reissue claims would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in this art at the time the invention was made . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Reissue claims 2-9 are either dependent on reissue claim 1 , include similar limitations , or include additional limitations .

( `` Solvay '' ) appeals from a judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Delaware in favor of defendant Honeywell International ( `` Honeywell '' ) . The district court held that asserted claim 1 of Solvay 's U.S. Patent No . 6,730,817 ( `` the ¡¬817 patent '' ) was invalid under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 102 ( g ) ( 2 ) ( 2006 ) . This was so because engineers working at the Russian Scientific Center for Applied Chemistry ( `` RSCAC '' ) first conceived the invention , which was reduced to practice in this country by Honeywell personnel pursuant to the RSCAC 's instructions , and did not abandon , suppress , or conceal it . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ BACKGROUND _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I _NEWLINE_ The question at the heart of this appeal is when an invention conceived by a foreign inventor and reduced to practice in the United States qualifies as prior art *1000 under ¡± 102 ( g ) ( 2 ) .1 That section provides , `` [ a ] person shall be entitled to a patent unless ... before such person 's invention thereof , the invention was made in this country by another inventor who had not abandoned , suppressed , or concealed it . '' 35 U.S.C . ¡± 102 ( g ) ( 2 ) . Although section 102 ( g ) initially was designed for determining priority of invention in interference proceedings , it is settled that the section has `` independent significance as a basis for prior art outside of the interference context . '' Thomson , S.A. v. Quixote Corp. , 166 F.3d 1172 , 1175 n. 3 ( Fed.Cir.1999 ) ; see also Solvay v. Honeywell International , Inc. ( `` Solvay I `` ) , 622 F.3d 1367 , 1375-76 ( Fed.Cir.2010 ) . A patent is invalid under that section if the claimed invention was made in this country by another inventor before the patent 's priority date . See , e.g. , Solvay I , 622 F.3d at 1375 n. 3 ( describing 1999 amendments to ¡± 102 ( g ) ) . Making the invention requires conception and reduction to practice . While conception is the `` formation , in the mind of the inventor , of a definite and permanent idea of a complete and operative invention , '' reduction to practice `` requires that the claimed invention work for its intended purpose . '' Id . at 1376 ( citing Hybritech , Inc. v. Monoclonal Antibodies , Inc. , 802 F.2d 1367 , 1376 ( Fed.Cir.1986 ) ) . It is also necessary that the invention not be suppressed , abandoned , or concealed . See , e.g. , Apotex USA , Inc. v. Merck & Co. , 254 F.3d 1031 , 1036 ( Fed.Cir.2001 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Our prior cases have illuminated what is meant by `` made in this country . '' See , e.g. , Solvay I , 622 F.3d at 1376 ( citing Mycogen Plant Sci. , Inc. v. Monsanto Co. , 243 F.3d 1316 , 1331 ( Fed.Cir.2001 ) ; Apotex , 254 F.3d at 1036 ) . Although the inventors may reside in a foreign country and conceive the invention abroad , a reduction to practice made outside the United States is beyond the scope of ¡± 102 ( g ) ( 2 ) prior art . In other words , ¡± 102 ( g ) ( 2 ) allows conception to occur in another country , but in such circumstances requires the work constituting the reduction to practice to be performed in the United States by or on behalf of the inventor.2 However , `` there is no requirement that the inventor be the one to reduce the invention to practice so long as the reduction to practice was done on his behalf '' in the United States . In re DeBaun , 687 F.2d 459 , 463 ( CCPA 1982 ) ( citing Litchfield v. Eigen , 535 F.2d 72 , 76 ( CCPA 1976 ) ) . Consistent with that principle , `` [ a ] cts by others working explicitly or implicitly at the inventor 's request will inure to his benefit . '' 3A Donald S. Chisum , Chisum on Patents ¡± 10.06 [ 3 ] . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Here , Honeywell contends that the invention was conceived by Russian inventors outside the United States and reduced to practice in the United States by Honeywell *1001 personnel following the Russian inventors ' instructions before the ¡¬817 patent 's priority date . It follows , argues Honeywell , that the invention qualifies as ¡± 102 ( g ) ( 2 ) prior art . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ II _NEWLINE_ Solvay 's ¡¬817 patent claims an improvement to a method of making a hydrofluorocarbon ( `` HFC '' ) known as HFC-245fa.3 ¡¬817 patent col. 1 ll . 4-5 . HFC-245fa belongs to a group of HFCs that do not deplete the ozone layer and for that reason , are legislatively mandated to replace ozone-depleting alternatives . HFC-245fa is especially useful in preparing polymeric materials commonly used for insulation in refrigeration and heat storage systems . The ¡¬817 patent has a priority date of October 23 , 1995 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In 1994 , before Solvay 's priority date , Honeywell and RSCAC personnel entered into a research contract . Pursuant to that agreement , RSCAC engineers , working in Russia , conducted process development studies for the commercial production of HFC-245fa . In July 1994 , the RSCAC sent Honeywell a report documenting the development of a continuous process capable of producing high yields of HFC-245fa by reacting HCC-240fa4 with hydrogen fluoride in the presence of a catalyst . Honeywell personnel in the United States used the RSCAC 's report to run the same process in this country in 1995 , before the ¡¬817 patent 's October priority date.5 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Solvay sued Honeywell in the District of Delaware , alleging that the process Honeywell was using to manufacture HFC-245fa infringed certain claims of the ¡¬ 817 patent . Independent claim 1 , the only claim at issue on appeal , reads : _NEWLINE_ In a process for the preparation of [ HFC-245fa ] comprising reaction of [ HCC-240fa ] with hydrogen fluoride in the presence of a hydrofluorination catalyst , the improvement which comprises carrying out the reaction at a temperature and under a pressure at which [ HFC-245fa ] is gaseous and isolating ... [ HFC-245fa ] from the reaction mixture by drawing off [ HFC-245fa ] and hydrogen chloride [ HCl ] in a gaseous phase as each of said [ HFC245fa ] and [ HCl ] is being formed . _NEWLINE_ ¡¬817 patent , col. 5 ll . 36-46 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Honeywell defended , inter alia , on the ground that independent claim 1 and dependent claims 5 , 7 , 10 , and 11 of the ¡¬817 patent were invalid under ¡± 102 ( g ) ( 2 ) . Honeywell 's initial theory was that its engineers had reduced the invention to practice in the United States and that this made the Honeywell engineers inventors under ¡± 102 ( g ) ( 2 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In 2008 , the district court construed the `` isolating '' limitation in claim 1 to read : _NEWLINE_ The process for making HFC-245fa includes a reaction at a temperature and under a pressure whereby HFC-245fa and HCl are produced in gaseous form and separated from the reaction mixture in a gas stream that can include other compounds , such as unconverted reactants and chlorofluoropropanes possibly formed by incomplete fluorination of HCC-240fa . _NEWLINE_ *1002 J.A . 4 ( emphasis added ) . The district court thus construed `` isolating '' to require `` separating '' HFC-245fa and HCl from the reaction mixture . Id . It did not require separating only those components from the reactor . Id . Based on that claim construction , the district court ruled on summary judgment that Honeywell 's process infringed claims 1 , 5-7 , 10 , and 11 . However , the district court granted summary judgment of invalidity as to claims 1 , 5 , 7 , 10 , and 11 under ¡± 102 ( g ) ( 2 ) on the ground that the Honeywell engineers were other inventors who made the invention in this country without abandoning , suppressing , or concealing it.6 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court 's judgment was appealed to this court . On appeal , we agreed with the district court 's claim construction of the term `` isolating '' in claim 1 , explaining that `` claim 1 is not limited to 'isolating ' only HFC-245fa and HCl and residual amounts of other compounds . '' Solvay I , 622 F.3d at 1382 . We affirmed the district court 's ruling on summary judgment that claims 1 , 5 , 7 , 10 , and 11 were infringed . However , we reversed the finding that claims 1 , 5 , 7 , 10 , and 11 were invalid under ¡± 102 ( g ) ( 2 ) , explaining that Honeywell personnel could not qualify as `` another inventor '' because they `` did not conceive the invention of the ¡¬817 patent , but derived it from others , '' specifically , the RSCAC engineers who `` first conceived the invention in Russia . '' Id . at 1378-79 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On remand , Honeywell asserted an alternative theory as to why ¡± 102 ( g ) ( 2 ) applied , arguing that the Russian inventors made the invention in this country by sending instructions to Honeywell personnel who used the instructions to reduce the invention to practice in this country . The parties did not dispute the fact that , under the district court 's claim construction , the RSCAC process corresponded to the invention recited in claim 1 of the ¡¬817 patent or that the RSCAC engineers first conceived the invention and reduced it to practice in Russia . But the parties disputed whether ( 1 ) the Honeywell reduction to practice should be attributed to the Russian inventors and ( 2 ) whether the Russian inventors had disclosed the invention rather than abandoning , suppressing , or concealing it . Although the district court held that , as a matter of law , the RSCAC engineers should be treated as inventors who made the invention in the United States under ¡± 102 ( g ) ( 2 ) , it denied summary judgment on the invalidity of claim 1 because of genuine issues of material fact as to whether the RSCAC engineers disclosed their invention in a 1994 Russian patent application rather than abandoning , suppressing , or concealing it . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Eventually , a jury determined that , as required by ¡± 102 ( g ) ( 2 ) , the RSCAC did disclose the invention of claim 1 in the 1994 Russian patent application such that they did not abandon , suppress , or conceal it . Based on the jury verdict , the district court entered judgment for Honeywell , finding asserted claim 1 invalid under ¡± 102 ( g ) ( 2 ) .7 Solvay appealed . We have *1003 jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C . ¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ DISCUSSION _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I _NEWLINE_ The priority date for Solvay 's ¡¬817 patent is October 23 , 1995 . The parties do not dispute that if the Russians conceived the invention and reduced it to practice in this country before that date without abandoning , suppressing , or concealing it , claim 1 of Solvay 's ¡¬817 patent is invalid under ¡± 102 ( g ) ( 2 ) . On appeal , Solvay does not dispute that the Russians were first to conceive the invention recited in claim 1 or that Honeywell reduced it to practice in this country before Solvay 's October 23 , 1995 , priority date , but challenges ( 1 ) the jury 's finding of nonsuppression , and ( 2 ) the district court 's ruling that the Russians made the invention in this country . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As to the first issue , Solvay argues that the district court erroneously construed claim 1 and that the resulting instructions tainted the jury 's finding that the Russians disclosed the invention in a 1994 Russian patent application and , therefore , did not suppress or conceal it . In other words , Solvay argues that the application did not satisfy ¡± 102 ( g ) ( 2 ) because the application did not disclose the full scope of the claims if they were properly construed . Before addressing the merits of Solvay 's claim construction contention , we consider whether Solvay has waived its objection by failing to request in the district court the construction it now advocates . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A _NEWLINE_ The general rule is that `` an appellate court does not give consideration to issues not raised below . '' Hormel v. Helvering , 312 U.S. 552 , 556 , 61 S.Ct . 719 , 85 L.Ed . 1037 ( 1941 ) ; see also Singleton v. Wulff , 428 U.S. 106 , 120 , 96 S.Ct . 2868 , 49 L.Ed.2d 826 ( 1976 ) . The doctrine of waiver `` has been applied to preclude a party from adopting a new claim construction position on appeal . '' Interactive Gift Express , Inc. v. Compuserve Inc. , 256 F.3d 1323 , 1346 ( Fed.Cir.2001 ) . A claim construction argument is considered `` new '' if a party `` change [ s ] the scope of the claim construction '' rather than `` clarifying or defending the original scope of its claim construction '' or `` supporting its existing claim construction position with new citations to the specification . '' Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ According to Solvay , claim 1 requires that HFC-245fa and HCl be removed from the reaction mixture permanently so that the HFC-245fa and HCl are not recycled back into the reactor . Claim 1 reads : _NEWLINE_ In a process for the preparation of [ HFC-245fa ] comprising reaction of [ HCC-240fa ] with [ HF ] in the presence of a hydrofluorination catalyst , the improvement which comprises carrying out the reaction at a temperature and under a pressure at which [ HFC-245fa ] is gaseous and isolating ... [ HFC-245fa ] from the reaction mixture by drawing off [ HFC-245fa ] and [ HCl ] in a gaseous phase as each of said [ HFC-245fa ] and [ HCl ] is being formed . _NEWLINE_ ¡¬817 patent col. 5 ll . 36-46 ( emphasis added ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ When this case was first appealed , this court upheld the district court 's construction of the term `` isolating '' in claim 1 of the ¡¬817 patent to mean `` drawing off '' or `` separating '' HFC-245fa and HCl from the reaction , but not necessarily `` purifying '' the drawn-off material . Solvay I , 622 F.3d at 1382 . As a result , the gas stream conveying HFC-245fa from the reactor can include other compounds from the reaction mixture , not only HFC-245fa and HCl . The parties did not raise , and this court did not address , the issue of whether the *1004 HFC-245fa and HCl could return to the reactor after being drawn off initially . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Near the end of the validity trial , however , a disagreement between the parties arose as to whether the reaction products had to be permanently isolated from the reaction mixture . Solvay argued that `` isolating '' the reaction products necessarily required keeping them separated . In response , Honeywell argued that requiring permanent separation contradicted the district court 's claim construction , affirmed by this court , as well as the plain language of the claim . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court held that , based on claim language , specification references , and this court 's construction of the term `` isolating , '' the reaction products did not have to be permanently isolated from the reaction mixture . The court granted Honeywell 's request for a standard jury instruction that the term `` comprising '' means that `` the claim is not limited to a process that includes only what is in the claim and nothing else . '' J.A . 49 . At trial , Honeywell argued that the ¡¬817 patent could read on processes in which HFC-245fa and HCl return to the reaction mixture through additional steps after the initial separation . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Solvay contends that the district court 's instruction reflected an erroneous interpretation of `` isolating . '' According to Solvay , if given the correct interpretation , `` the jury might well have found that the Russian application did not disclose Solvay 's invention '' because in the RSCAC process , some gaseous HFC-245fa condenses back into a liquid and drips back into the reaction mixture after the initial separation . Reply Br . 34 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The problem is that Solvay did not ask the district court to modify the claim construction or accompanying jury instruction to require `` isolating '' to mean `` isolating permanently . '' When the issue surfaced at trial , it was raised by Honeywell in response to Solvay 's questioning of its expert witness . Honeywell argued that Solvay was attempting to make improper claim construction arguments to the jury . In response , Solvay insisted that the isolating limitation necessarily implied permanence notwithstanding the ambiguity that the disagreement between the parties made apparent . The district court , which had not previously been asked to consider the issue of permanence , asked the parties to submit briefs on the issue . Solvay , in its brief , still did not request any modification or clarification of the claim construction , `` reassert [ ing ] that it agree [ d ] with the Court 's proposed construction . '' J.A . 5263 . Because Solvay failed to object to the court 's construction or jury instruction with respect to the term `` isolating , '' 8 it waived the issue and can not now raise novel arguments to redefine the scope of claim 1 . See LizardTech , Inc. v. Earth Res . Mapping , Inc. , 424 F.3d 1336 , 1341 ( Fed.Cir.2005 ) ( a party that `` agreed to the district court 's construction at the time ... can not [ on appeal ] argue against that claim construction simply because it resulted in an adverse ruling '' ) .9 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B _NEWLINE_ Even if the claim construction issue had been properly raised , we see no *1005 error in the district court 's construction . Claim construction is a question of law reviewed de novo . Cybor Corp. v. FAS Techs. , Inc. , 138 F.3d 1448 , 1451 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) . The conclusion that `` isolating '' means `` separating , '' and therefore does not preclude additional steps that could occur after the initial isolation , is consistent with the claims and specification . Claim 1 of the ¡¬817 patent uses the transitional term `` comprises '' to define the bounds of the patented improvement . See ¡¬ 817 patent col. 5 l.40 . The well-established meaning of `` 'comprising ' in a method claim indicates that the claim is open-ended and allows for additional steps . '' Invitrogen Corp. v. Biocrest Mfg. , L.P. , 327 F.3d 1364 , 1368 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) ( citing Vivid Techs. , Inc. v. Am . Sci . & Eng ' g , Inc. , 200 F.3d 795 , 811 ( Fed.Cir.1999 ) ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We agree with the district court that nothing in the claims or specification overcomes the well-established meaning of `` comprises '' as a transitional term allowing for additional steps . Solvay supports its position by pointing to a portion of the specification stating that `` [ i ] t is advantageous to separate the [ HFC-245fa ] and the [ HCl ] from the reaction mixture as they are being formed and to keep in , or return to , the reactor the unconverted reactants , as well as the chlorofluoropropanes possibly formed by incomplete fluorination of [ HCC-240fa ] . '' ¡¬817 patent col. 2 l. 64 to col. 3 l. 2 . On its face , the statement pertains to recycling reactants , not reaction products , and does not expressly or impliedly preclude recycling reaction products to the reaction mixture as well . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Solvay attempts to buttress its argument by pointing out that the reference in the specification corresponds to a statement in the ¡¬817 patent 's prosecution history that purportedly `` shows that the isolation limitation was intended to distinguish '' the invention from the prior art , specifically the ¡¬ 192 patent . Reply Br . 32 . According to Solvay , it amended claim 1 to avoid rejection in view of the ¡¬192 patent and thus explained to the examiner that its invention `` enables [ HFC-245fa ] to be easily separated from the reaction mixture , which is an advantage as it makes it possible to retain or to return to the reactor the unconverted reactants and [ products of incomplete fluorination ] . '' J.A . 8364 . As with the specification reference , the statement pertains only to recycling reactants and incomplete reaction products and does not require HFC245fa or HCl to be isolated once and for all time when they first leave the reaction mixture in gaseous form . It does not follow that distinguishing a process on the basis of the continuous removal of reaction products also requires such removal to be permanent . Continuous removal pertains to the status of the reaction and does not connote or require permanence with respect to steps occurring after products are formed and removed while the reaction is still ongoing . We find no legal error in the court 's claim construction . Under this claim construction , Solvay does not on appeal contest that the Russian patent application sufficiently disclosed the invention.10 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ II _NEWLINE_ Solvay urges that , even under the district court 's claim construction , the requirements of ¡± 102 ( g ) ( 2 ) are not satisfied . Solvay does not dispute that Honeywell fully performed the RSCAC 's process for making HFC-245fa in the United States *1006 before the ¡¬817 patent 's October 1995 priority date . Nor is it disputed that , under the district court 's claim construction , the RSCAC process corresponds to the invention claimed by the ¡¬817 patent . Instead , Solvay argues that ( 1 ) the doctrine of inurement , defining when the activities of others inure to the benefit of the inventor , controls the question of whether Honeywell 's work can be attributed to the RSCAC engineers , and ( 2 ) the undisputed facts do not establish inurement because the RSCAC engineers did not expressly ask the Honeywell researchers to perform the inventive process . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Assuming that the inurement doctrine governs , inurement does not require that the inventor expressly request or direct the non-inventor to perform reductive work . To be sure , no inurement can arise from a third party 's `` unwarranted and hostile use '' of another 's invention , Burgess v. Wetmore , 1879 Dec. Comm ' r Pat . 237 , 240 ( no inurement of reduction to practice built by rival applicant ) , but an express request or direction is not required . The request may be `` implicit [ ] . '' Cooper v. Goldfarb , 154 F.3d 1321 , 1332 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) . In Hogue v. Cowling , 26 CCPA 874 , 101 F.2d 541 , 542 , 544 , 550 ( 1939 ) , a third party 's reduction to practice inured to the benefit of the inventor , who disclosed his idea for a `` confection making apparatus '' to the manager of a popsicle company and suggested that the latter sketch the invention . The manager did not merely make a sketch , but built and tested a working device , believing he was `` acting in accordance '' with the inventor 's wishes . Id . at 550 . The inventor knew nothing about the third party 's work , but was still able to claim it as his own to establish the priority of his invention . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Similarly , in Learned v. Thompson , 39 C.C.P.A . 730 , 191 F.2d 409 , 410-11 , 415 ( 1951 ) , an inventor benefited from work performed by a third party with whom he had no direct communication . The inventor , Learned , disclosed his invention and offered it to the United States government , which then turned the disclosure over to an employee , who reduced the invention to practice . Id . at 410-11 . The employee even filed his own patent application for improvements he made , although he later abandoned that application in the first inventor 's favor . Id . at 410 . The court treated the reduction to practice as the inventor 's because he had given `` authorization to the Government '' to use his invention . Id . at 415 . The inventor 's authorization was sufficient even though he never asked the government or its employee to reduce the invention to practice nor supervised the reductive work . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In Kendall v. Searles , 36 C.C.P.A . 1045 , 173 F.2d 986 , 992 ( 1949 ) , as with Honeywell and the RSCAC , Fafnir and Westinghouse had a `` joint program of development . '' The inventor , an official at Fafnir , conceived the invention and communicated his conception to Westinghouse , which conducted tests necessary to establish the inventor 's reduction to practice and the priority of his invention . Id . at 991-92 . Although it appears that the inventor did not have `` anything to do with the tests conducted by Westinghouse , '' those tests were held to inure to his benefit . Id . at 992 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Thus , our case law does not support Solvay 's contention that an inventor must make an express directive or request to benefit from a third party 's reduction to practice . Rather , inurement exists if the inventor authorizes another to reduce his invention to practice . Here , the research agreement between the RSCAC and Honeywell confirms that the RSCAC authorized Honeywell to practice its invention in the United States and contemplated that Honeywell would do so . The contract *1007 stated that `` RSCAC will assist [ Honeywell ] in the development of manufacturing processes for hydrofluorocarbon compounds ( HFCs ) ... or hydrofluorocarbon ethers ( HFC ethers ) . '' J.A . 3355 . Pursuant to that agreement , Honeywell promised to provide yearly compensation , information , and equipment , while the Russians agreed to produce 1,000 kg of HFC-245fa , develop production processes , and send regular reports to Honeywell detailing their results and progress . While title and rights to inventions would belong to Honeywell , the RSCAC could make , use , and sell those inventions in Russia . The collaborative research arrangement between Honeywell and the RSCAC thus parallels the joint development program in Kendall , 173 F.2d at 992 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Solvay does not suggest that the RSCAC did not intend for Honeywell to use the information it sent or that it did not authorize Honeywell to reproduce the process it described . The undisputed facts show that the RSCAC authorized Honeywell to practice its invention and specifically contemplated that it would do so under the companies ' joint research agreement aimed at developing commercial processes for the production of HFC-245fa . The RSCAC engineers gave Honeywell personnel the information they needed to perform the inventive process in this country in July 1994 , and Honeywell relied on that information in so doing . As we noted in our earlier decision , `` in early 1995 , Honeywell replicated the Russian process by following the information provided by RSCAC , thereby practicing the invention in the United States before the ¡¬817 patent 's priority date . '' Solvay I , 622 F.3d at 1374 ( emphasis added ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Solvay argues that there can be no inurement here because Honeywell independently benefited from performing the RSCAC process . Solvay in particular points to Honeywell 's subsequent filing of its own patent application and notes that in Burgess , the existence of a rival patent application was held , in part , to defeat inurement . But Learned shows that the mere filing of a related patent application does not in itself preclude inurement . Here , the Russians applied for and received a patent in Russia , while Honeywell filed a patent application in the United States . The parties did not view these applications as rivals , providing that Honeywell was entitled to exclusive rights to inventions resulting from the collaboration while the Russians were entitled only to sublicenses . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We therefore agree with the district court that the process invented by the Russian engineers was made in this country when Honeywell successfully performed the process because the Russians authorized Honeywell personnel to practice the invention and specifically contemplated that they would do so.11 We affirm *1008 the district court 's judgment that the ¡¬817 patent is invalid under ¡± 102 ( g ) ( 2 ) .12 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ AFFIRMED . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ NEWMAN , Circuit Judge , dissenting . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The court today creates a new class of secret prior art , holding that a privately performed experiment , without publication or public knowledge or use or sale or inclusion in a United States patent application , is invalidating `` prior art . '' Heretofore the role of secret prior art has been carefully circumscribed . The new general rule here adopted contravenes the policy and the letter of patent law , wherein inventors are charged only with knowledge of what is known or knowable as defined by statute , subject to special limited circumstances . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The panel majority holds that private secret activity-in this case Honeywell 's evaluation of Russian technology that had been invented in Russia and placed in an unpublished Russian patent application-is `` prior art '' against all others , thereby invalidating the Solvay patent . The panel majority does not recognize the unavailability of an interference contest , for there is no United States counterpart to the Russian patent application . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In the prior appeal of this case , Solvay S.A. v. Honeywell Int ' l , Inc. , 622 F.3d 1367 ( Fed.Cir.2010 ) ( Solvay I ) , this court confirmed that the Russian invention was conceived and reduced to practice in Russia , and that Honeywell 's repetition of the process in the United States was not an invention made in the United States . Testing the invention of another is not an act of invention by the tester . This aspect was finally resolved in Solvay I , the court describing Honeywell 's work in the United States as a `` derivation '' of the Russian invention . The matter was finally decided ; it is not open for redetermination . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Undaunted , the panel majority now rules that Honeywell 's activity was a `` reduction to practice '' of the Russian process . The private/secret duplication of the prior invention of another does not convert either that prior invention or its duplication into prior art . The issue here is not priority between the Russian invention and the Solvay invention ; the issue is prior art against the world . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Honeywell test of the Russian process was a private experiment . No United States patent application was filed on the Russian process , not by Honeywell and not by the Russian inventors . A private experiment is not prior art , when it is not published , nor used , sold or otherwise made known , nor included in a United States patent application . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The panel majority concedes that the Russian process was conceived and reduced to practice in Russia and placed in a Russian patent application , for which no corresponding United States application was filed . Nonetheless the panel majority holds that the Russian invention was `` made in this country , '' maj. op . at 1007 , because it was privately communicated to Honeywell , who tested it in this country . The panel majority states that the Honeywell test `` inured '' to the benefit of the Russians . However , the Russians had no United States patent application that could benefit from `` inurement , '' even if my colleagues had not created the theory ( for *1009 Honeywell does not so state ) that Honeywell performed this evaluation on behalf of the Russian inventors . My colleagues simply rule that due to `` inurement '' the secret Honeywell test converts the still secret Russian technology into `` prior art . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In the earlier appeal in this case , the status of Honeywell 's test of the Russian technology was established , by final judgment , as `` derivation . '' Honeywell 's private testing did not convert the subject technology into prior art . The court 's new class of secret prior art enlarges the situations in which unknowable private activity may serve to invalidate the independent inventions of third parties . From the confused and incorrect new law announced by the court , I respectfully dissent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ DISCUSSION _NEWLINE_ In the prior appeal in this action , the court considered Honeywell 's status in the context of ¡± 102 ( g ) ( 2 ) : _NEWLINE_ Since it is undisputed that Honeywell did not originate the invention , but reproduced it in the United States by following RSCAC 's instructions , Honeywell can not be said to have conceived of the invention and can not , consequently , be an inventor for purposes of ¡± 102 ( g ) ( 2 ) . _NEWLINE_ Solvay I , 622 F.3d at 1378 . The court decided , unequivocally and finally , that Honeywell was not the inventor of the Russian technology _NEWLINE_ but , rather , derived it from RSCAC [ Russian Scientific Center for Applied Chemistry ] , whose engineers invented it in Russia . _NEWLINE_ Id . at 1374 . These rulings are the law of this case . It is no longer before this court to attempt to treat the Russian technology as if it were invented in the United States . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Also , I must correct the court 's erroneous statement concerning Honeywell 's later-filed United States patent application on its subsequent improvement and development of the Russian process . It is misleading to state that `` the Russians applied for and received a patent in Russia , while Honeywell filed a patent application in the United States . '' Maj. op . at 1007 . The Honeywell patent application was not on the Russian invention but on the later Honeywell invention , as explained in Solvay I : _NEWLINE_ Throughout the summer of 1995 , Honeywell continued working to develop and perfect its process for the preparation of HFC-245fa . The work included finding optimum operating conditions for the process , as well as designing and enabling downstream purification of the HFC-245fa product . Development of a pilot plant to test a commercially viable manufacturing process for HFC-245fa was begun by Honeywell , and the plant was in successful operation by February 1996 . In March 1996 , Honeywell began drafting a patent application on an improvement process for making HFC-245fa . The application was filed on July 3 , 1996 , and eventually issued as U.S. Patent No . 5,763,706 ( `` the ¡¬706 patent '' ) . The ¡¬706 patent discloses a process for the continuous preparation of HFC-245fa , using optimal conditions for downstream purification , so that the HFC-245fa recovered by distillation has a high purity ( at least about 99.5 % ) . See ¡¬706 patent , col.1 l.60-col.2 l.25 ; col.4 ll.40-42 . _NEWLINE_ Solvay I , 622 F.3d at 1372 ( citations omitted ) . My colleagues ' suggestion that this Honeywell patent was the United States counterpart of the Russian patent application , or somehow converted Honeywell 's evaluation of the Russian invention into `` prior art '' against Solvay and all others , is untenable . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The court in Solvay I resolved that the Russian invention was not made in the United States . The panel majority now *1010 concedes that the Russian process was conceived and reduced to practice in Russia , maj. op . at 1002 , but states that `` ¡± 102 ( g ) ( 2 ) allows conception to occur in another country , but in such circumstances requires the work constituting the reduction to practice to be performed in the United States by or on behalf of the inventor . '' Maj. op . at 1000 . This is incorrect on two fronts . First , this court has never held that an invention conceived in a foreign country is `` made in this country '' under ¡± 102 ( g ) ( 2 ) . And second , it was not shown that Honeywell 's work in the United States was `` by or on behalf of '' the Russian inventors . Honeywell never so stated ; that is a postulate of the panel majority . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In priority contests between conflicting United States patent applications under ¡± 102 ( g ) ( 1 ) , reliance for priority has occasionally been authorized on activity conducted in the United States on behalf of a foreign applicant . Here there is no priority contest , no United States patent application , and no domestic activity on behalf of a foreign inventor . The cases cited by the panel majority are inapplicable . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The majority cites Holmwood v. Sugavanam for the thesis that a `` foreign inventor was 'another inventor ' under ¡± 102 ( g ) ( 2 ) when the invention was reduced to practice in the United States on his behalf . '' Maj. op . at 1000 n. 2 . Holmwood was an interference case under ¡± 102 ( g ) ( 1 ) . Section 102 ( g ) ( 2 ) was not at issue , nor did the foreign inventor claim to be `` another inventor . '' The majority 's citation is out of context , for the case is not applicable to any of the issues before us . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The other cases cited to support the ruling that Honeywell 's private/secret activity in the United States converted the Russian process into `` prior art '' are all `` interference '' contests , where United States activity served as evidence of priority of invention . E.g. , Shurie v. Richmond , 699 F.2d 1156 , 1158 ( Fed.Cir.1983 ) ( evidence that the process in interference was performed on behalf of the inventor in the United States ) ; Scott v. Koyama , 281 F.3d 1243 ( Fed.Cir.2002 ) ( evidence of disclosure in the United States to show conception by a party to the interference ) ; Tyler Refrigeration Corp. v. Kysor Industrial Corp. , 601 F.Supp . 590 ( D.Del.1985 ) , aff 'd on other grounds , 777 F.2d 687 ( Fed.Cir.1985 ) ( an actual reduction to practice in the United States could be relied on by a foreign inventor to support interference priority ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The panel majority 's reliance on `` inurement '' is thus irrelevant , for there is no United States application to which the Honeywell experiment could inure . Whether activity in the United States can support a foreign inventor 's interference priority has no relation to whether that activity is prior art against the world . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The panel majority insists that the Russian invention was merely conceived in Russia , and although reduced to practice in Russia , was also `` reduced to practice '' by Honeywell in the United States , whereby the panel majority concludes that the Russian invention was `` made in this country . '' Maj. op . at 1007 . Not even Honeywell made that argument , and there was no evidence or argument that Honeywell 's work was done at the request of and on behalf of the Russians . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The panel majority makes much of the conclusion that the Russians did not `` abandon , suppress , or conceal '' their invention . No one argued otherwise . However , the unpublished , unused , unknown , Russian invention , contained in a Russian patent application with no United States counterpart , does not thereby become prior art . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1011 Unpublished private activity in a foreign country is not prior art . Foreign inventions may of course be the subject of a United States patent , and the benefit of a foreign filing date may be obtained in accordance with 35 U.S.C . ¡± 119 . Here , however , there is no corresponding United States patent . The Russian patent application , filed on May 28 , 1994 , would , according to Russian law , have been `` laid open '' eighteen months later , on November 28 , 1995 , after Solvay 's priority date of October 23 , 1995 . Whether or not Honeywell 's work with the Russian process in the United States `` inured '' to the Russians , it could not convert the unpublished Russian application , or its unpublished evaluation in the United States , into prior art . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The issue here is not whether Honeywell has a personal defense to infringement , as the panel majority states : `` We have repeatedly held that prior invention by another is a defense to infringement . '' Maj. op . at 1007-08 n. 11 . The issue is whether the Russian secret process became prior art against the world when Honeywell secretly reproduced it in the United States . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Checkpoint case , relied on by the panel majority , is misapplied , first because Checkpoint confirms that ¡± 102 ( g ) relates to inventions `` made in this country , '' and second because Checkpoint on its facts offers no guidance here . In Checkpoint the question was patent validity related to inventorship , and the court stated , citing ¡± 102 ( g ) , that : `` Checkpoint does not contest that Kaltner completed the subject invention in this country . '' Checkpoint Sys. , Inc. v. U.S. Int ' l Trade Comm ' n , 54 F.3d 756 , 761 ( Fed.Cir.1995 ) . The court explained that `` a first inventor may seek to avoid a determination of abandonment by showing that he or she marketed or sold a commercial embodiment of the invention or described the invention in a publicly disseminated document , '' id . at 762 , none of which is here asserted . The only possible relevance of Checkpoint would be to show that the Russian invention was indeed abandoned by the Russians in the United States . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Amgen and New Idea decisions that the majority cites to support its flawed reliance on Checkpoint concern inventions made in this country . In Amgen the question was whether conception and reduction to practice occurred together or separately for DNA sequence identification work done in this country . Amgen , Inc. v. Chugai Pharm . Co. , Ltd. , 927 F.2d 1200 , 1205 ( Fed.Cir.1991 ) . And New Idea discussed the inventor 's work in this country , stating that `` Burkhart 's testimony further showed that in early 1971 , a prototype harvester was built with an arched tongue and a center pivot connection to the harvester . '' New Idea Farm Equip . Corp. v. Sperry Corp. , 916 F.2d , 1561 , 1566 ( Fed.Cir.1990 ) . There was no issue of foreign invention . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Invalidation by secret prior art is disfavored . See OddzOn Prods. , Inc. v. Just Toys , Inc. , 122 F.3d 1396 , 1402 ( Fed.Cir.1997 ) ( `` Thus , the patent laws have not generally recognized as prior art that which is not accessible to the public . `` ) ; Kimberly-Clark Corp. v. Johnson & Johnson , 745 F.2d 1437 , 1446 ( Fed.Cir.1984 ) ( defining ¡± 102 `` prior art '' as `` technology already available to the public , '' and stating that `` secret prior art '' may not be used to invalidate a patent under ¡± 102 ( g ) ) . The majority 's spin on ¡± 102 ( g ) takes `` secret prior art '' into unintended territory . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ There is no issue before us of whether Honeywell might have a personal defense against the Solvay patent ; the only issue is whether the secret Honeywell test of the unpublished Russian process is prior art against the world . The court 's ruling that prior art includes secret information is of far-reaching potential impact . It is as unnecessary *1012 as it is inappropriate to so enlarge the scope of secret prior art . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I respectfully dissent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 742 F.3d 998 , 109 U.S.P.Q.2d 1609 _NEWLINE_ Footnotes _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The activities at issue occurred before the enactment of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act ( `` AIA '' ) , Pub.L .

Richmond , 699 F.2d 1156 , 1158 ( Fed.Cir.1983 ) ( no reduction to practice where the inventive process was carried out in Canada , not the United States ) ; Breuer v. DeMarinis , 558 F.2d 22 , 27 ( CCPA 1977 ) ( foreign inventors reduced the invention to practice in this country when reduction to practice was done on their behalf in the United States ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 3 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The chemical name for HFC-245fa , used in the ¡¬817 patent , is 1 , 1 , 1 , 3 , 3-pentafluoropropane . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 4 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The chemical name for HCC-240fa , used in the ¡¬817 patent , is 1 , 1 , 1 , 3 , 3-pentachloropropane . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 5 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Honeywell eventually filed a patent application covering a refined version of the RSCAC process in July 1996 , which issued as U.S. Patent No . 5,763,706 ( `` the ¡¬706 patent '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 6 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Although the district court 's invalidity ruling did not include claim 6 , the parties stipulated that claim 6 would be withdrawn , and that Solvay could reassert it if only if claims 1 , 5 , 7 , 10 , and 11 were held not invalid . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 7 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The jury also determined that claim 1 , the only claim asserted at trial , was anticipated in view of U.S. Patent No . 5,574,192 ( `` the ¡¬ 192 patent '' ) and obvious in view of the ¡¬192 patent and U.S. Patent No . 5,202,509 . The district court entered a judgment of invalidity on those grounds as well . In light of our disposition on appeal , we need not reach these other issues . The parties do not explain why on remand only claim 1 was the subject of the invalidity trial . It appears likely that the parties agreed that the remaining claims found to be infringed would stand or fall together with claim 1 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 8 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Solvay did not preserve the issue by objecting to the `` comprising '' instruction . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 9 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ At trial , Solvay asserted that the phrase `` as each of said [ HFC-245fa ] and [ HCl ] is being formed '' should have been added to the jury instruction on claim 1 . J.A . 96 . In its motion for a new trial , Solvay did not renew that objection . The final jury instruction on claim 1 was modified only slightly to include `` continuously '' and `` or drawn off . '' J.A . 96 . On appeal , Solvay concedes that `` [ t ] his instruction is consistent with the claim limitation requiring 'isolati [ on ] ' . '' Reply Br . 27 ( second alteration in original ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 10 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On appeal , there is no contention that disclosure of the reduction to practice was required . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 11 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The dissent argues that the majority is improperly incorporating concepts from interferences into the infringement context , and is allowing `` secret prior art '' to invalidate a patent . Dissent at 1008-09 , 1011-12 . The dissent is incorrect . We have repeatedly held that prior invention by another is a defense to infringement . See , e.g. , Checkpoint Sys. , Inc. v. U.S. Int ' l Trade Comm ' n , 54 F.3d 756 , 761-62 ( Fed.Cir.1995 ) ( `` However , ¡± 102 ( g ) is applicable in other contexts as well , such as when it is asserted as a basis for invalidating a patent in defense to an infringement suit . '' ) ( citing Amgen , Inc. v. Chugai Pharm . Co. , 927 F.2d 1200 , 1203 ( Fed.Cir.1991 ) ; New Idea Farm Equip . Corp. v. Sperry Corp. , 916 F.2d 1561 , 1565 ( Fed.Cir.1990 ) ) . The invention was described in the Russian patent application . It is also established that ¡± 102 ( g ) requires that the prior inventor not `` abandon , suppress , or conceal '' his invention . See , e.g. , Apotex , 254 F.3d at 1037 ( `` A ¡± 102 ( g ) prior invention defense is governed by the identical 'suppressed or concealed ' language applicable to priority determinations in interference proceedings. '' ) . Here , the jury specifically found that the Russian inventors did not abandon , suppress , or conceal their invention , a conclusion the dissent does not dispute . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 12 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We need not consider the district court 's exclusion of statements made by an attorney prosecuting a patent for Honeywell given Solvay 's admission , during oral argument , that this issue has no bearing on invalidity under ¡± 102 ( g ) ( 2 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_

The effect of such assemblies is to allow the bicyclists to increase the power transmitted to the wheels by simultaneously applying a downward , pushing force with one foot and an upward , pulling force with the other . Clip-less pedal and cleat assemblies offer one method of performing that function . With clip-less pedals and cleats , a rider can attach his feet securely to the pedals yet release them easily , in contrast to earlier systems using straps or cages . The cleats attach to the rider 's shoes and engage the pedals , which are specially designed to interact with the cleats . In most clip-less pedal systems , the rider attaches his foot to the pedal by stepping straight *1249 down on the pedal until the cleat engages with the pedal . The rider typically releases his foot by rotating his foot to the side , which disengages the cleat from the pedal . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Richard Bryne , the chief executive officer and founder of Speedplay , Inc. , is the inventor and primary designer of Speedplay 's bicycle pedals . He obtained U.S. Patent No . 4,942,778 ( the '778 patent ) on a clip-less pedal and cleat system , and in 1992 entered the market with a product based on that patent . Shortly thereafter , Bryne was issued U.S. Patent No . 5,213,009 ( the '009 patent ) , which claims a multilayered cleat design . Within two years of its founding , Speedplay entered into two agreements with Bryne . The first granted Speedplay a license under the '778 patent and improvements thereon , while the second assigned to Speedplay all of Bryne 's bicycle-related inventions made during his employment with the company . Steven Zoumaras , who held a 50 % interest in the '778 patent in return for financing its procurement , was also a party to the license , but he assigned his entire interest to Speedplay during the course of the trial . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ John Steinberg , the president and founder of Bebop , Inc. , is the inventor of the Bebop bicycle pedals . In 1989 , Steinberg conceived the basic idea for the Bebop pedal , which features a hollow , cylindrical body . Over the next few years , Steinberg refined the concept , obtained a patent on the invention , and marketed two Bebop pedal designs . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Shortly after Bryne saw a Bebop prototype in 1993 , the parties clashed over intellectual property and commercial tort issues . The dispute led to the present lawsuit , in which Speedplay claimed that Bebop was infringing the '778 and '009 patents by manufacturing and marketing the Bebop clip-less bicycle pedals . In addition , Speedplay alleged that Bebop was infringing Speedplay 's trade dress under section 43 ( a ) of the Lanham Act , 15 U.S.C . ¡± 1125 ( a ) , was engaging in unfair competition under California common law , and was violating the California Business and Professions Code . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Bebop counterclaimed , seeking a declaration that the '778 and '009 patents were invalid , that they were not infringed by Bebop 's products , and that Bebop 's products did not infringe Speedplay 's trade dress . Bebop also sought relief for alleged unfair competition and intentional interference with prospective economic advantage . While the case was pending , Bryne was issued U.S. Patent No . 5,606,894 ( the '894 patent ) on a clip-less bicycle pedal , and Speedplay amended its complaint to add an allegation of infringement of the '894 patent . Bebop responded by alleging that the '894 patent was invalid and that all three patents were unenforceable because of inequitable conduct . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Following a 10-day bench trial , the trial court entered judgment against Speedplay on all the claims in its amended complaint . With respect to Bebop 's counterclaims , the court held the '894 patent invalid because the invention was on sale more than one year before the patent application was filed . See 35 U.S.C . ¡± 102 ( b ) . The court denied relief to Bebop , however , on its state law claims , on its request to hold Speedplay 's other two patents invalid and all three patents unenforceable , and on its request for attorney fees . Both parties appealed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ II _NEWLINE_ Bebop raises a threshold issue concerning Speedplay 's right to bring an action for infringement of the '778 , '009 , and '894 patents in its own name . The trial judge concluded that Bryne had transferred `` all right , title , and interest to the inventions '' to Speedplay , thereby securing to Speedplay the right to sue individually for infringement of the patents . We agree that Speedplay has standing to maintain this suit . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A party may bring an action for patent infringement only if it is the `` patentee , '' i.e. , if it owns the patent , either by *1250 issuance or by assignment . See 35 U.S.C . ¡±¡± 100 ( d ) , 261 , 281 . A party that has been granted all substantial rights under the patent is considered the owner regardless of how the parties characterize the transaction that conveyed those rights . Thus , in Vaupel Textilmaschinen KG v. Meccanica Euro Italia S.P.A. , 944 F.2d 870 , 874 , 873-76 , 20 USPQ2d 1045 , 1048 , 1047-50 ( Fed.Cir.1991 ) , this court held that the proper focus is on `` the substance of what was granted , '' and that the grantee of an exclusive license could sue in its own name without joining the grantor if the license had the effect of conveying all substantial rights in the patent to the licensee . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Speedplay asserts that it obtained all substantial rights in the '778 , '009 , and '894 patents from Bryne , and that it may therefore sue for infringement in its own name . To support that assertion , Speedplay must produce a written instrument documenting the transfer of proprietary rights in the patents . See 35 U.S.C . ¡± 261 ; Enzo APA & Son , Inc. v. Geapag A.G. , 134 F.3d 1090 , 1093 , 45 USPQ2d 1368 , 1370-71 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) . Speedplay relies on two documents , a Contribution and License Agreement and a Confidentiality and Inventions Agreement , to support its assertion of patent rights . Bebop contends that those two documents are insufficient to allow Speedplay to sue in its own name . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A _NEWLINE_ Through the Contribution and License Agreement ( CLA ) , Speedplay issued common stock to Bryne and Zoumaras in exchange for broad rights in Bryne 's initial pedal technology . The CLA defines two categories of rights . First , it defines `` Licensed Product '' as follows : _NEWLINE_ Bryne and Zoumaras are the owners of a design for a clipless bicycle pedal system as described and claimed in the United States Letters Patent 4,942,778 , issued July 24 , 1990 to Richard M. Bryne and entitled CLIPLESS BICYCLE PEDAL SYSTEM ( `` Licensed Product '' ) ... . _NEWLINE_ Second , it defines `` Licensed Patents '' as follows : _NEWLINE_ Bryne is the inventor and title holder of United States Letters Patent 4,522,221 , and related foreign patent applications ( collectively , the `` Licensed Patents '' ) ... . _NEWLINE_ Based on those definitions , the grant to Speedplay consists of an `` exclusive worldwide , royalty-free , right and license under and to the Licensed Patents and the exclusive rights and license to manufacture , have manufactured , distribute , market , use and sell the Licensed Product and any other apparatus , instrument , device or product covered in whole or in part by the Licensed Patents . '' In addition , the agreement permits Speedplay to exercise its granted rights through agents and sublicensees . All rights under the CLA terminate with the last to expire of the Licensed Patents , unless terminated earlier for various specified reasons such as breach or insolvency . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The primary problem with the CLA derives from the patent number cited in the definition of Licensed Patents . Although naming Bryne as the inventor , the definition refers to U.S. Patent No . 4,522,221 , which is an unrelated patent on unrelated technology issued and assigned to some unknown third parties . Speedplay asserted at oral argument that the reference to that patent was a scrivener 's error and that a reference to the '778 patent was intended . That contention finds support in the portion of the CLA that refers to `` the Licensed Product and any other apparatus . . . covered . . . by the Licensed Patents , '' which indicates that the term Licensed Patents was meant to refer to patents that covered the Licensed Product . In addition , another provision of the CLA requires Speedplay to mark each Licensed Product with a notice `` identifying by U.S. patent number the Licensed Patent . '' Because a Licensed Product is a pedal system `` described and claimed '' by the *1251 '778 patent , the CLA could not logically require such a product to be marked with any patent number other than 4,942,778 . Consequently , we agree with Speedplay that despite the patent number erroneously set forth in the CLA , the explicitly defined Licensed Patents must be construed to mean the '778 and related foreign patents . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The conclusion that Licensed Patents include the '778 patent undermines Bebop 's main argument that the CLA did not transfer all substantial patent rights to Speedplay because Speedplay did not receive the right to enforce the '778 patent . Under the CLA , Speedplay has the `` sole right to enforce the Licensed Patents , '' which we construe as giving Speedplay the right to enforce the '778 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Bebop argues in the alternative that Bryne and Zoumaras retained other substantial rights in the '778 patent that would prevent Speedplay from suing on that patent in its own name . Bebop 's strongest argument on this point derives from the following language of the CLA : `` In the event that [ Speedplay ] fails to halt an infringement . . . within three ( 3 ) months , '' then `` Bryne and/or Zoumaras shall have the option to initiate appropriate legal proceedings in his/their own name . '' Relying on Abbott Laboratories v. Diamedix Corp. , 47 F.3d 1128 , 33 USPQ2d 1771 ( Fed.Cir.1995 ) , Bebop claims that the grantors ' retention of that option is dispositive . We disagree . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In Abbott , the licensor retained an option to sue an infringer if the exclusive licensee did not . Even if the licensee brought suit , it could not manage the action in a manner that would compromise the licensor 's rights in the patent and could not prevent the licensor from participating in the suit . In addition , the grant to the licensee was subject to prior-granted licenses and to a limited right of the licensor to make , use , and sell products embodying the patented invention . Finally , the licensee could not freely assign its license . Considering all the rights retained by the licensor , the court concluded that the licensor was a necessary party to the infringement action brought by the licensee . Abbott , 47 F.3d at 1132 , 33 USPQ2d at 1775 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Abbott does not control this case . Unlike in Abbott , the license grant was not subject to any prior-granted licenses or to any retained rights by the licensor to practice the patent . Moreover , the CLA does not grant Bryne and Zoumaras the right to participate in an infringement action brought by Speedplay , nor does it limit Speedplay 's management of any such action . In addition , Bryne and Zoumaras 's right to sue an infringer if Speedplay does not is illusory , because Speedplay can render that right nugatory by granting the alleged infringer a royalty-free sublicense . Although the licensee in Abbott could grant sublicenses , its right to do so was not unfettered , because it was liable for annual royalties on the sales of the sublicensees . Abbott , 47 F.3d at 1129 , 33 USPQ2d at 1772 . Speedplay thus controls enforcement of the '778 patent for all practical purposes . Even though Bryne and Zoumaras retained the right to sue , that right would not hinder Speedplay 's enjoyment of the patent rights in any meaningful way . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Bebop next contends that under the CLA Speedplay can not assign its interest in the license without the consent of Bryne and Zoumaras , and that Speedplay 's rights in the patent are therefore curtailed . To be sure , the licensee 's inability to assign its interest was a factor important to the holding in Abbott . But again the factual differences between Abbott and this case dictate a different outcome . The licensor in Abbott had an absolute right to veto any assignment proposed by the licensee , other than to a successor in business . Abbott , 47 F.3d at 1132 , 33 USPQ2d at 1775 . Under the CLA , however , Bryne and Zoumaras 's consent to an assignment `` shall not be withheld unreasonably . '' Bryne and Zoumaras 's only reasonable basis for refusing consent would be the impairment *1252 of their consideration for entering the CLA . As we held in Vaupel , 944 F.2d at 875 , 20 USPQ2d at 1049 , a licensor does not retain a substantial right in a patent merely by reserving a reversion in the patent contingent upon the licensee 's financial distress or the licensee 's cessation of production of machines embodying the patented invention . In effect , the Vaupel termination provision simply protected the licensor 's consideration , which consisted in part of an ongoing royalty stream . Although the form of the protective mechanism differs in this case , the principle of Vaupel compels a conclusion that the consent requirement does not significantly restrict the scope of Speedplay 's rights in the '778 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Bebop next argues that the `` Improvements '' clause of the CLA leaves a significant right in Bryne and Zoumaras . The CLA defines an `` improvement '' to include `` any invention or development that falls within the fair scope of any of the claims of the Licensed Patent . '' If Speedplay makes improvements during the term of the agreement , it is required to `` assign to Bryne and Zoumaras , as tenants in common , all right , title and interest in and to the Improvements , '' including any related patents and patent applications . That right of Bryne and Zoumaras is limited , however , by the further provision of the CLA that `` [ t ] he Improvements shall become part of the Licensed Patent for purposes of this Agreement . '' As a consequence of that provision , any party 's successful effort to improve the pedal technology covered by the '778 patent during the term of the agreement would redound to Speedplay 's exclusive benefit for that term . The Improvements clause thus serves to protect Bryne and Zoumaras 's reversionary interest in any improvements , but not to limit Speedplay 's proprietary interests in improvements made during the pendency of the agreement . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Finally , Bebop claims that Bryne and Zoumaras retain two additional substantial rights in the '778 patent . The CLA requires Speedplay to mark products intended for foreign sale `` in accordance with written instructions '' from Bryne and Zoumaras . The right to dictate the markings on products sold abroad may or may not be significant as a practical matter , but the right is certainly not one that interferes with the rights in a U.S. patent , which are limited in reach to the United States . See Vaupel , 944 F.2d at 875 , 20 USPQ2d at 1049 ( finding that the licensor 's right to obtain foreign patents did not affect the patent-standing inquiry ) . The CLA also requires Speedplay to allow Bryne and Zoumaras to inspect Speedplay 's books and records regarding the exercise of rights under the agreement . Given the CLA 's provision for termination upon the insolvency of Speedplay , which is consistent with Vaupel 's provision for termination upon bankruptcy , see id. , the inspection provision constitutes a policing mechanism , not a substantial proprietary right . Accordingly , we conclude that Bryne and Zoumaras retained no substantial rights in the '778 patent , and that Speedplay therefore may sue in its own name for infringement of that patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B _NEWLINE_ Because the '009 patent claims a cleat that Speedplay and Bryne contend improves upon the cleat claimed in the '778 patent , Speedplay argues that it obtained all significant rights to the '009 patent pursuant to the Improvements clause of the CLA . Bebop does not challenge the basic factual contention that the '009 patent is an improvement on the '778 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As noted above , Speedplay obtains the rights to improvements made after the effective date of the CLA by any party to that agreement . Bryne , Zoumaras , and Speedplay executed the CLA on December 15 , 1991 , with an agreed effective date of September 20 , 1991 . Bryne applied for the '009 patent on October 18 , 1991 , subsequent to the effective date of the CLA . *1253 Speedplay therefore obtained all substantial rights to the '009 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ C _NEWLINE_ Speedplay traces its rights in the '894 patent to the Confidentiality and Inventions Agreement ( CIA ) entered into on September 17 , 1992 , by Bryne as employee and Speedplay as employer . The CIA defines an `` Invention '' to be any intellectual property conceived or developed by Bryne within the scope of his employment and during the term of the agreement . All inventions covered by the CIA `` shall belong exclusively to [ Speedplay ] and [ Bryne ] hereby conveys , transfers and assigns to [ Speedplay ] .-.- . all right , title and interest in and to Inventions . '' As the '894 parent application was submitted on April 29 , 1994 , Speedplay argues that it automatically obtained title to the '894 patent pursuant to the CIA . We agree . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Bebop challenges Speedplay 's rights in the '894 patent on two grounds . First , Bebop contends that the CIA is merely a `` promise to assign a future invention . '' That contention invokes this court 's decision in Arachnid , Inc. v. Merit Industries , Inc. , 939 F.2d 1574 , 1576 , 19 USPQ2d 1513 , 1514 ( Fed.Cir.1991 ) , in which a contractor agreed that any inventions it conceived `` 'shall be the property of [ the client ] , and all rights thereto will be assigned ' `` by the contractor to the client . Holding that the client could not bring an infringement action based on that contractual language , the Arachnid court characterized the promise as `` an agreement to assign , not an assignment . '' Id . at 1580 , 1580-81 , 19 USPQ2d at 1518 , 1518-19 . The language in the CIA , however , differs significantly from the language at issue in Arachnid . It provides that inventions `` shall belong '' to Speedplay , and that Bryne `` hereby conveys , transfers and assigns '' the inventions to Speedplay . Therefore , this case is not controlled by Arachnid , but by Filmtec Corp. v. Allied-Signal Inc. , 939 F.2d 1568 , 1570 , 19 USPQ2d 1508 , 1509 ( Fed.Cir.1991 ) , in which the contractor agreed `` 'to grant and does hereby grant ' `` to the client the rights and title to any invention , whether patentable or not . In Filmtec , this court stated that `` no further act would be required once an invention came into being ; the transfer of title would occur by operation of law . '' Id . at 1573 , 939 F.2d 1568 , 19 USPQ2d at 1512 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Second , Bebop seeks to distinguish between the assignment of a future invention and the assignment of the patent on that invention , implying that the CIA does not cover the latter . Filmtec , which linked title to the invention and title to the ensuing patent , also disposes of that argument . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ D _NEWLINE_ Our disposition of the standing issue in this case does not expose Bebop to the risk of prejudice that can result from improper joinder of parties in a suit for patent infringement . By restricting the availability of a remedy for infringement to the de facto owner of the patent , the standing doctrine serves `` to enable the alleged infringer to respond in one action to all claims of infringement for his act , and thus either to defeat all claims in the one action , or by satisfying one adverse decree to bar all subsequent actions . '' Independent Wireless Telephone Co. v. Radio Corp. of America , 269 U.S. 459 , 468 , 46 S.Ct . 166 , 70 L.Ed . 357 ( 1926 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Bebop will not be exposed to a successive suit on the same subject matter brought by Bryne in his own name . Confirming inferences drawn from the record , counsel for Speedplay admitted at oral argument that Speedplay is a closely held corporation and that Bryne controls the operation of Speedplay . Also , the record clearly shows that Bryne participated actively in the conduct of the action on behalf of the corporation . Consequently , the judgment in this case will have preclusive effect with respect to any parallel claim that might be brought by Bryne . See , e.g. , Rhode Island Hosp . Trust Nat ' l Bank v. *1254 Bogosian ( In re Belmont Realty Corp. ) , 11 F.3d 1092 , 1097 ( 1st Cir.1993 ) ; Kreager v. General Elec . Co. , 497 F.2d 468 , 472 ( 2d Cir.1974 ) ; Restatement ( Second ) of Judgments ¡± 59 ( 3 ) ( a ) ( 1982 ) . In addition , Speedplay offered before trial to join Bryne as a party , but Bebop resisted that motion . Bebop therefore can not now reasonably complain that it is prejudiced by having to defend a lawsuit brought by Speedplay without the participation of Bryne as a party . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ III _NEWLINE_ Speedplay alleges that two of Bebop 's products infringed the '778 and '009 patents . The first , designated the Bebop-1 , was sold between 1995 and 1997 . The second , designated the Bebop-2 , first sold in 1997 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Bebop-1 pedal consists of a spindle that penetrates through a rotating metal cylinder that is open on the top and bottom and partially open on the sides . Either of the roughly circular edges that constitute the top and bottom of the cylinder can engage with the cleat , whereupon spring-loaded tongues on each side of the cleat secure the pedal to the cleat by protruding into the openings in the sides of the cylinder . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In the Bebop-2 , the cylindrical portion of the pedal does not consist of a single piece of metal , but comprises two circular metal rings that correspond generally to the two edge-portions of the Bebop-1 cylinder . The two rings are connected by screws to each other and to the spindle housing , so that the space between the two rings is largely open except for the spindle housing . Either of the two rings can engage with the spring-loaded tongues in the cleat in the same way that the top or bottom edge of the Bebop-1 cylinder can engage with the cleat . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ? _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A _NEWLINE_ Speedplay alleged infringement of 12 of the '778 patent 's claims , including independent claim 1 , which reads in relevant part as follows : _NEWLINE_ A clipless bicycle pedal system for releasably binding the sole of a rider 's shoe to a pedal which comprises : _NEWLINE_ a pedal comprising : _NEWLINE_ an axle fixedly attached to the end of a crank arm of a bicycle ; and _NEWLINE_ a block rotatably mounted on said axle , said block having a top , a bottom and a circumferential edge , said top and said bottom each being a generally convex surface , said block being generally circular in the lateral plane with said circumferential edges joining said top to [ said ] bottom and a leading edge and a trailing edge oppositely disposed within said circumferential edge , and having a plurality of grooves formed in said circumferential edge of said pedal and aligned with longitudinal and lateral planes of a bicycle on which said pedal system is mounted , *1255 at least one of said grooves toward said trailing edge of said pedal block and one toward said leading edge ... . _NEWLINE_ The critical language of the claim , for purposes of this case , is the reference to the body of the pedal as consisting of a `` block having a top , a bottom , and a circumferential edge , said top and said bottom each being a generally convex surface . '' Relevant drawings showing the pedal block ( item 12 ) and convex surfaces ( item 13 ) of the '778 patent embodiment are set forth below . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ? _NEWLINE_ Speedplay alleges that the trial court erred in finding no infringement of the '778 patent , either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents . Given the requirement that the pedal consist of a block with top and bottom surfaces that are generally convex , however , the trial court was plainly correct in finding that neither the Bebop-1 nor the Bebop-2 literally infringes claim 1 of the '778 patent . Neither the open ends of the Bebop-1 cylinder nor the open rings of the Bebop-2 structure have generally convex surfaces that serve as the top or bottom of a block , as is required by the '778 patent . Therefore , the Bebop pedals do not embody every limitation of the pertinent claims of the '778 patent and can not literally infringe . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In order to find infringement of the '778 patent under the doctrine of equivalents , the court would have to find every limitation of claim 1 present in the Bebop pedals , either literally or equivalently . See Ethicon Endo-Surgery , Inc. v. United States Surgical Corp. , 149 F.3d 1309 , 1315-19 , 47 USPQ2d 1272 , 1276-79 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) . As in the case of literal infringement , the `` convex surface '' limitation of claim 1 defeats Speedplay 's argument that the Bebop pedals infringe under the doctrine of equivalents . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Bebop 's patent expert testified at trial that the convex surface of the block recited in the claim performs two functions . First , the convex surface compresses the tongues in the cleat as the cleat descends on the pedal ; the tongues then resile upon encountering the open groove in the circumference of the pedal . Second , the convex surface causes the pedal to align with the cleat as the cleat descends onto it . Speedplay 's patent expert agreed that the convex surface limitation performed both of those functions , and Bebop introduced evidence that a convex surface would promote self-alignment . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The patent specification and a statement made by Bryne in a reissue application for the '778 patent also focus on the self-alignment function of the convex-surface limitation . In a section entitled `` Detailed Description of the Invention , '' the patent specification describes the cooperation between the pedal and the cleat as follows ( numbers refer to items in the '778 drawings set forth above ) : _NEWLINE_ The rider places the shoe 25 with cleat 4 over pedal [ assembly ] 12 . The symmetrical curved top surface of the pedal centers the recessed area 11 over pedal 12 , guiding cleat 4 to its proper position . Even if the pedal is not parallel to [ the ] lateral plane ... at the time the rider initially attempts to engage cleat 4 and pedal 12 , the curved surface 13 of pedal *1256 12 will cause block 12 ' [ i.e. , the body of the pedal assembly ] to rotate so that cleat 4 is centered over pedal 12 . _NEWLINE_ In the reissue application , Bryne described the importance of the critical limitation as follows : _NEWLINE_ Clearly , the convex nature of the top and the bottom is essential to the function of the overall pedal system in order to properly interact with the cleat ... . The convex surface of the top and the bottom situated on either side of a pedal platform ... [ allows the pedal ] to engage the cleat ... , even if the top or bottom is not perfectly vertically positioned immediately prior to attempted engagement of the pedal and cleat . _NEWLINE_ In deposition and trial testimony Bryne appeared to retreat from these comments , stating that the convex surface primarily serves to compress the tongues of the cleat and that `` self-locating comes from having a circular shape in a circular shape . '' The trial court , however , was entitled to accord little weight to the `` litigation-induced pronouncements of the inventor , '' which were contrary to clear statements in the written description and reissue application . Vehicular Techs . Corp. v. Titan Wheel Int ' l , Inc. , 141 F.3d 1084 , 1092 , 46 USPQ2d 1257 , 1263 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) . Consequently , the trial court correctly determined that the convex surface limitation requires an equivalent structure in the Bebop pedals to perform a self-alignment function . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Although primarily focusing on the Bebop-2 pedal , the trial court determined that the Bebop pedals do not perform a self-aligning function , and the evidence supports that factual finding . Speedplay 's expert claimed that a small bevel on the edges and rings of the Bebop pedal `` enable [ s ] the initial engagement , ... the initial seating [ of the pedal ] into the recess . '' Bebop 's witnesses , however , denied that the Bebop pedals perform a self-alignment function , and it was not clearly erroneous for the trial court to accept Bebop 's evidence on that point and reject Speedplay 's contrary evidence . We therefore affirm the trial judge 's ruling that Bebop 's products do not infringe the '778 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B _NEWLINE_ Speedplay alleged that the Bebop products infringe three claims of the '009 patent under the doctrine of equivalents : independent claim 17 , and dependent claims 20 and 21 . Claim 17 provides in relevant part as follows ( emphasis added ) : _NEWLINE_ A cleat for attachment to a sole of a bicycle shoe for use with a clipless bicycle pedal , said sole having a toe end and a heel end and a plurality of bores having a spacing according to an industry standard and being generally flat at its lower surface , said cleat comprising : _NEWLINE_ a first plate having a cavity at its center , a first plurality of slots generally aligned with said plurality of bores and at least one channel adjacent to said cavity , said cavity having a diameter for receiving at least a portion of said clipless bicycle pedal ; _NEWLINE_ at least one spring means to be retained in said at least one channel so that a portion of said at least one spring means extends into said cavity ; _NEWLINE_ a second plate abutting said first plate and having a perimeter corresponding to the perimeter of said first plate , a second plurality of slots aligned with said first plurality of slots and an opening corresponding to said cavity ; and _NEWLINE_ a fastening means inserted through each slot of said second plurality and through each corresponding slot of said first plurality to be received in each bore of said plurality ; _NEWLINE_ wherein insertion of said at least a portion of said clipless bicycle pedal into said cavity causes said spring means to releasably retain said clipless bicycle pedal adjacent to said sole . _NEWLINE_ The emphasized limitations resolve the infringement issue . The trial court construed `` slot '' to mean a `` narrow notch , *1257 groove or opening in a plate . '' Speedplay does not contest that construction . Relevant drawings from the '009 patent are set forth below , showing the first ( item 50 ) and second ( item 62 ) plurality of slots : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ? _NEWLINE_ The cleats of the Bebop-1 and Bebop-2 are essentially identical for purposes of this case . Each has a metal base plate that attaches to the sole of the rider 's shoe with two fasteners that pass through a two-hole washer and through each end of an elongated aperture in the base plate of the cleat . Two small crescent-shaped metal plates are mounted on either end of the base plate , accommodating the top edge of the cylindrical portion of the Bebop-1 pedal or top ring of the Bebop-2 pedal within the generally circular recess formed by the crescent plates ' inner edges . Each crescent is attached with three fasteners and supported away from the base plate by spacers and by the stationary end of the spring-loaded tongue that secures the pedal to the cleat . The floating end of the spring-loaded tongue resides in the area under the crescent-shaped pieces of metal . Assembled and exploded views of the Bebop cleat are shown below . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ? _NEWLINE_ Speedplay 's expert offered a limitation-by-limitation comparison of the '009 patent with the Bebop cleats . According to Speedplay 's expert , the `` first plate '' limitation of claim 17 is met equivalently by combining Bebop 's base plate and the spacers supporting the crescents . In the expert 's view , the aperture in the base plate functions as the claimed `` plurality of slots '' by allowing the two fasteners to pass through the base plate and secure the cleat to the shoe . The second plate , the expert contended , comprises the two crescent-shaped plates and the two-hole washer that retains the base plate . The `` second plurality of slots '' limitation , according to the expert , is met equivalently by the two holes in the washer . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Although Speedplay 's expert identified the structures in the Bebop cleats that he alleged to be equivalents of the two plurality-of-slots limitations in the patent , the expert did not identify the way the slot limitations perform the function of accommodating the fasteners that secure the cleat to the shoe . Therefore , his testimony did not establish that the corresponding structures in the Bebop cleat perform that *1258 function in a substantially identical way . Speedplay 's trial brief and the claim chart attached to it likewise failed to satisfy the legal standard for a finding of equivalence with respect to the slot limitations . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Strong and unrebutted evidence in the record supports the conclusion that the slots in claim 17 allow adjustment of the cleat 's position on the sole , either forward-and-backward or side-to-side . For example , the '009 patent specification mentions adjustment frequently when referring to a slot , noting that the slots allow adjustment `` to match the individual rider 's foot and knee rotation for comfort , and to optimize energy transfer from the foot to the pedal . '' Discussing his development of the invention that resulted in the '009 patent , Bryne testified that the slots allow adjustment of the cleat on the sole . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Bebop 's founder also testified that he understood the claimed slots to allow adjustment . As to the Bebop cleats , however , he testified that the single elongated aperture in the base plate allows `` virtually no adjustability of the location of the fasteners . '' No evidence was offered to rebut that testimony . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Because the evidence indicates that the slot limitations in the '009 patent allow the fasteners to secure the cleat to the shoe in an adjustable way and that the corresponding structure on the base plate of the Bebop cleats-the elongated aperture-does not accommodate the fasteners in an adjustable way , the trial judge permissibly found that the Bebop cleats did not infringe the '009 patent under the doctrine of equivalents . See Dawn Equipment Co. v. Kentucky Farms Inc. , 140 F.3d 1009 , 1016-17 , 46 USPQ2d 1109 , 1113-14 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) ; Wolverine World Wide , Inc. v. Nike , Inc. , 38 F.3d 1192 , 1199 , 32 USPQ2d 1338 , 1341-42 ( Fed.Cir.1994 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ IV _NEWLINE_ The trial court rejected Speedplay 's claim that Bebop infringed its trade dress rights . Under Ninth Circuit law , which applies to Speedplay 's Lanham Act claim , Speedplay was required to prove that its trade dress is distinctive and nonfunctional , and that consumers are likely to confuse Bebop 's pedals with Speedplay 's pedals . See Disc Golf Ass ' n v. Champion Discs , Inc. , 158 F.3d 1002 , 1005 , 48 USPQ2d 1132 , 1134 ( 9th Cir.1998 ) . The trial court found that Speedplay proved its design to be distinctive , but did not prove nonfunctionality or likelihood of confusion . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Despite Speedplay 's contrary assertion , the trial court considered the evidence offered by Speedplay and found that evidence insufficient to support a conclusion that confusion was likely . The court , unpersuaded by Speedplay 's contrary evidence , determined that the two products are sold in distinct markets . In addition , the court acknowledged the isolated instances of actual confusion cited by Speedplay , but accorded them little weight under the circumstances . Cf . Nutri/System , Inc. v. Con-Stan Indus. , Inc. , 809 F.2d 601 , 606-07 , 1 USPQ2d 1809 , 1813 ( 9th Cir.1987 ) ( concluding that the evidence of actual confusion was de minimis in light of the nature of the instances and the volume of the parties ' business ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The trial court 's finding that there was little likelihood of confusion is not clearly erroneous , which is the standard of review that the Ninth Circuit applies to a trial court 's finding on that issue . See Levi Strauss & Co. v. Blue Bell , Inc. , 778 F.2d 1352 , 1355-56 , 228 USPQ 346 , 348-49 ( 9th Cir.1985 ) ( en banc ) . We therefore uphold the court 's ruling on the trade dress issue without addressing the court 's alternative ruling on the issue of functionality . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ V _NEWLINE_ At trial , Bebop sought to have Speedplay 's patents declared unenforceable because of inequitable conduct on Speedplay 's part . The trial court determined that Bebop did not show by clear and convincing evidence that Speedplay and its *1259 counsel intended to mislead the Patent and Trademark Office ( PTO ) and therefore refused to hold the patents unenforceable . In its cross-appeal , Bebop claims that Speedplay and its counsel intentionally failed to disclose material prior art to the PTO during prosecution of the '778 , '009 , and '894 patents . In addition , Bebop alleges that the pendency of the present litigation was material information that Speedplay should have disclosed to the PTO in connection with the prosecution of the '894 patent . For those reasons , Bebop argues , the three patents should be held unenforceable . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A party alleging that a patent is unenforceable because of the patentee 's failure to disclose material information to the PTO must offer clear and convincing evidence that the patentee intended to mislead the PTO . See Molins PLC v. Textron , Inc. , 48 F.3d 1172 , 1178 , 33 USPQ2d 1823 , 1826 ( Fed.Cir.1995 ) . The omission must be made with the specific intent to mislead , not merely from carelessness in the performance of a duty . Id . at 1181 , 48 F.3d 1172 , 33 USPQ2d at 1829 . When a trial court makes a finding on the issue of intent in deciding an inequitable-conduct claim , we review that finding for clear error . Id . at 1178 , 48 F.3d 1172 , 33 USPQ2d at 1827 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Bryne and his patent counsel testified that they did not intend to deceive the PTO . Although they admitted familiarity with much of the prior art cited by Bebop , they contended that the prior art was not material . The trial judge credited their testimony regarding their opinions of the prior art , citing supporting evidence that some of the art taught away from the claimed invention , that similar patents had issued over the prior art , and that Speedplay 's patent specifications discussed , in general terms , much of the prior art . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Although we agree with Bebop that a `` mere denial of intent to mislead '' does not suffice , see Critikon , Inc. v. Becton Dickinson Vascular Access , Inc. , 120 F.3d 1253 , 1257 , 43 USPQ2d 1666 , 1669 ( Fed.Cir.1997 ) , the trial judge 's finding of lack of intent was supported by adequate evidence and was not clearly erroneous . The cases on which Bebop relies all involve stronger circumstantial evidence of deceptive intent . See , e.g. , Elk Corp. v. GAF Bldg . Materials Corp. , 168 F.3d 28 , 30-32 , 49 USPQ2d 1853 , 1855-57 ( Fed.Cir . ) ( relying on the facts that the application claimed an improvement over the prior art , that the inventor 's request for a patentability search noted the similarity of the art , and that the prosecuting attorney 's testimony indicated knowledge that the prior art was material ) , cert . denied , 528 U.S. 873 , 120 S.Ct . 178 , 145 L.Ed.2d 150 ( 1999 ) ; Critikon , 120 F.3d at 1256 , 43 USPQ2d at 1669 ( citing the patentee 's knowledge that the prior-art reference read on a point of novelty that the examiner relied upon in prosecution ) ; Molins , 48 F.3d at 1181-82 , 33 USPQ2d at 1829 ( drawing an inference of intent from the fact that the patentee had cited the art in foreign applications , but not in the U.S. application ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Bebop further contends that Speedplay engaged in a pattern of inequitable conduct that requires holding all three patents unenforceable . In Consolidated Aluminum Corp. v. Foseco International Ltd. , 910 F.2d 804 , 812 , 15 USPQ2d 1481 , 1487 ( Fed.Cir.1990 ) , this court held that the intentional fabrication of a fictitious best mode in one patent rendered unenforceable three other patents in which the earlier concealment of best mode `` permeated the prosecution . '' Our analysis in Consolidated Aluminum made clear , however , that we would have to find inequitable conduct sufficient to hold at least one patent unenforceable before considering whether to hold an entire group of related patents unenforceable . Because we have sustained the trial court 's conclusion that no such inequitable conduct occurred in this case , we decline Bebop 's invitation to hold all three of Speedplay 's patents unenforceable because of an alleged pattern of inequitable conduct . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1260 VI _NEWLINE_ Finally , Bebop claims that it is entitled to its attorney fees under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 285 and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37 ( c ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In support of its claim for an award of fees under section 285 , Bebop alleges that Speedplay acted inequitably and failed to conduct an adequate investigation before bringing suit . We have already upheld the trial court 's ruling that Speedplay did not engage in inequitable conduct . With respect to the failure to investigate , Bebop contends that it incurred unnecessary legal fees preparing for trial on issues involving the '894 patent , which was held invalid because the invention was on sale more than one year before the patent application was filed . The court 's ruling on the on-sale bar issue was based on an invoice that Speedplay produced during trial . Bebop claims that Speedplay did not adequately search its records in response to discovery requests regarding the first-sale date . Bebop also claims that it incurred additional , unnecessary expenses because Speedplay did not adequately determine whether the patent claims read on Bebop 's products . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Bebop cites several cases for the proposition that section 285 fees should be imposed because Speedplay brought an action that it knew or `` on reasonable investigation '' should have known was unfounded . Those cases all involved more extreme conduct than was present here . In Eltech Systems Corp. v. PPG Industries , Inc. , 903 F.2d 805 , 810 , 14 USPQ2d 1965 , 1969 ( Fed.Cir.1990 ) , for example , we affirmed an award of fees because the trial court had before it evidence that the patentee knew its action was unfounded . Similarly , in Judin v. United States , 110 F.3d 780 , 784 , 42 USPQ2d 1300 , 1304 ( Fed.Cir.1997 ) , we upheld the imposition of sanctions because the patentee had not procured a sample of the allegedly infringing device before filing suit , and in Hughes v. Novi American , Inc. , 724 F.2d 122 , 124 , 220 USPQ 707 , 709 ( Fed.Cir.1984 ) , an award of fees was affirmed because the patentee had undertaken widespread sales more than two years before the date of the patent application , yet resisted the defendant 's efforts to have the patent declared invalid based on the on-sale bar . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The trial court in this case did not abuse its discretion by declining to award attorney fees to Bebop . Speedplay 's attorneys engaged a qualified expert to prepare for trial on the patent infringement issues , and its discovery of an invoice for a sale that predated by two months the date previously given for its first sale does not constitute such egregious conduct as to compel the court to treat this as an exceptional case . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Bebop bases its request for fees under rule 37 ( c ) on Speedplay 's refusal to make certain admissions in response to Bebop 's requests for admission . We have examined Bebop 's list of requests and conclude that all of Speedplay 's denials appear to have been made in good faith , based on a reasonable belief in the possibility of success at trial . Construing the trial court 's denial of fees as a ruling on the rule 37 issue , we find that Bebop has failed to show that the court abused its discretion in denying Bebop 's request for sanctions . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ AFFIRMED . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 211 F.3d 1245 , 53 U.S.P.Q.2d 1984

( `` Amazon '' ) against barnesandnoble.com , inc. , and barnesandnoble.com llc ( together , `` BN '' ) . Amazon moved for a preliminary injunction to prohibit BN 's use of a feature of its web site called `` Express Lane . '' BN resisted *1347 the preliminary injunction on several grounds , including that its Express Lane feature did not infringe the claims of Amazon 's patent , and that substantial questions exist as to the validity of Amazon 's patent . The United States District Court for the Western District of Washington rejected BN 's contentions . Instead , the district court held that Amazon had presented a case showing a likelihood of infringement by BN , and that BN 's challenges to the validity of the patent in suit lacked sufficient merit to avoid awarding extraordinary preliminary injunctive relief to Amazon . The district court granted Amazon 's motion , and now BN brings its timely appeal from the order entering the preliminary injunction . We have jurisdiction to review the district court 's order under 28 U.S.C . ¡± 1292 ( c ) ( 1 ) ( 1994 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ After careful review of the district court 's opinion , the record , and the arguments advanced by the parties , we conclude that BN has mounted a substantial challenge to the validity of the patent in suit . Because Amazon is not entitled to preliminary injunctive relief under these circumstances , we vacate the order of the district court that set the preliminary injunction in place and remand the case for further proceedings . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I _NEWLINE_ This case involves United States Patent No . 5,960,411 ( `` the ¡¬411 patent '' ) , which issued on September 28 , 1999 , and is assigned to Amazon . On October 21 , 1999 , Amazon brought suit against BN alleging infringement of the patent and seeking a preliminary injunction . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Amazon 's patent is directed to a method and system for `` single action '' ordering of items in a client/server environment such as the Internet . In the context of the ¡¬411 patent , a client/server environment describes the relationship between two computer systems in which a program executing on a client computer system makes a service request from another program executing on a server computer system , which fulfills the request . See col. 1 , ll . 10-31 ; col. 3 , ll . 31-33 ; col. 5 , l. 56 to col. 6 , l. 21 ; Fig . 2 . Typically , the client computer system and the server computer system are located remotely from each other and communicate via a data communication network . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The ¡¬411 patent describes a method and system in which a consumer can complete a purchase order for an item via an electronic network using only a `` single action , '' such as the click of a computer mouse button on the client computer system . Amazon developed the patent to cope with what it considered to be frustrations presented by what is known as the `` shopping cart model '' purchase system for electronic commerce purchasing events . In previous incarnations of the shopping cart model , a purchaser using a client computer system ( such as a personal computer executing a web browser program ) could select an item from an electronic catalog , typically by clicking on an `` Add to Shopping Cart '' icon , thereby placing the item in the `` virtual '' shopping cart . Other items from the catalog could be added to the shopping cart in the same manner . When the shopper completed the selecting process , the electronic commercial event would move to the check-out counter , so to speak . Then , information regarding the purchaser 's identity , billing and shipping addresses , and credit payment method would be inserted into the transactional information base by the soon-to-be purchaser . Finally , the purchaser would `` click '' on a button displayed on the screen or somehow issue a command to execute the completed order , and the server computer system would verify and store the information concerning the transaction . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As is evident from the foregoing , an electronic commerce purchaser using the shopping cart model is required to perform *1348 several actions before achieving the ultimate goal of the placed order . The ¡¬411 patent sought to reduce the number of actions required from a consumer to effect a placed order . In the words of the written description of the ¡¬411 patent : _NEWLINE_ The present invention provides a method and system for single-action ordering of items in a client/server environment . The single-action ordering system of the present invention reduces the number of purchaser interactions needed to place an order and reduces the amount of sensitive information that is transmitted between a client system and a server system . _NEWLINE_ Col. 3 , ll . 31-37 . How , one may ask , is the number of purchaser interactions reduced ? The answer is that the number of purchaser interactions is reduced because the purchaser has previously visited the seller 's web site and has previously entered into the database of the seller all of the required billing and shipping information that is needed to effect a sales transaction . Thereafter , when the purchaser visits the seller 's web site and wishes to purchase a product from that site , the patent specifies that only a single action is necessary to place the order for the item . In the words of the written description , `` once the description of an item is displayed , the purchaser need only take a single action to place the order to purchase that item . '' Col. 3 , ll . 64-66 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ II _NEWLINE_ The ¡¬411 patent has 26 claims , 4 of which are independent . Independent claims 1 and 11 are method claims directed to placing an order for an item , while independent claim 6 is an apparatus claim directed to a client system for ordering an item , and independent claim 9 is an apparatus claim directed to a server system for generating an order . Amazon asserted claims 1-3 , 5-12 , 14-17 , and 21-24 against BN . Although there are significant differences among the various independent and dependent claims in issue , for purposes of this appeal we may initially direct our primary focus on the `` single action '' limitation that is included in each claim . This focus is appropriate because BN 's appeal attacks the injunction on the grounds that either its accused method does not infringe the `` single action '' limitation present in all of the claims , that the `` single action '' feature of the patent is invalid , or both . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We set forth below the text of the claims pertinent to our deliberations ( i.e. , claims 1 , 2 , 6 , 9 , and 11 ) , with emphasis added to highlight the disputed claim terms : _NEWLINE_ 1 . A method of placing an order for an item comprising : _NEWLINE_ under control of a client system , _NEWLINE_ displaying information identifying the item ; and in response to only a single action being performed , sending a request to order the item along with an identifier of a purchaser of the item to a server system ; under control of a single-action ordering component of the server system , receiving the request ; retrieving additional information previously stored for the purchaser identified by the identifier in the received request ; and generating an order to purchase the requested item for the purchaser identified by the identifier in the received request using the retrieved additional information ; and fulfilling the generated order to complete purchase of the item whereby the item is ordered without using a shopping cart ordering model . _NEWLINE_ 2 . The method of claim 1 wherein the displaying of information includes displaying information indicating the single action . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ . . . . . _NEWLINE_ 6 . A client system for ordering an item comprising : an identifier that *1349 identifies a customer ; a display component for displaying information identifying the item ; _NEWLINE_ a single-action ordering component that in response to performance of only a single action , sends a request to a server system to order the identified item , the request including the identifier so that the server system can locate additional information needed to complete the order and so that the server system can fulfill the generated order to complete purchase of the item ; and _NEWLINE_ a shopping cart ordering component that in response to performance of an add-to-shopping-cart action , sends a request to the server system to add the item to a shopping cart . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ . . . . . _NEWLINE_ 9 . A server system for generating an order comprising : _NEWLINE_ a shopping cart ordering component ; and _NEWLINE_ a single-action ordering component including : _NEWLINE_ a data storage medium storing information for a plurality of users ; _NEWLINE_ a receiving component for receiving requests to order an item , a request including an indication of one of the plurality of users , the request being sent in response to only a single action being performed ; and _NEWLINE_ an order placement component that retrieves from the data storage medium information for the indicated user and that uses the retrieved information to place an order for the indicated user for the item ; and an order fulfillment component that completes a purchase of the item in accordance with the order placed by the single-action ordering component . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ . . . . . _NEWLINE_ 11 . A method for ordering an item using a client system , the method comprising : _NEWLINE_ displaying information identifying the item and displaying an indication of a single action that is to be performed to order the identified item ; and _NEWLINE_ in response to only the indicated single action being performed , sending to a server system a request to order the identified item _NEWLINE_ whereby the item is ordered independently of a shopping cart model and the order is fulfilled to complete a purchase of the item . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court interpreted the key `` single action '' claim limitation , which appears in each of the pertinent claims , to mean : _NEWLINE_ The term `` single action '' is not defined by the patent specification ... . As a result , the term `` single action '' as used in the ¡¬411 patent appears to refer to one action ( such as clicking a mouse button ) that a user takes to purchase an item once the following information is displayed to the user : ( 1 ) a description of the item ; and ( 2 ) a description of the single action the user must take to complete a purchase order for that item . _NEWLINE_ With this interpretation of the key claim limitation in hand , the district court turned to BN 's accused ordering system . BN 's short-cut ordering system , called `` Express Lane , '' like the system contemplated by the patent , contains previously entered billing and shipping information for the customer . In one implementation , after a person is presented with BN 's initial web page ( referred to as the `` menu page '' or `` home page '' ) , the person can click on an icon on the menu page to get to what is called the `` product page . '' BN 's product page displays an image and a description of the selected product , and also presents the person with a description of a single action that can be taken to complete a purchase order for the item . If the single action described is taken , for example by a mouse click , the person will have effected a *1350 purchase order using BN 's Express Lane feature . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ BN 's Express Lane thus presents a product page that contains the description of the item to be purchased and a `` description '' of the single action to be taken to effect placement of the order . Because only a single action need be taken to complete the purchase order once the product page is displayed , the district court concluded that Amazon had made a showing of likelihood of success on its allegation of patent infringement . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In response to BN 's contention that substantial questions exist as to the validity of the ¡¬411 patent , the district court reviewed the prior art references upon which BN 's validity challenge rested . The district court concluded that none of the prior art references anticipated the claims of the ¡¬ 411 patent under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 102 ( 1994 ) or rendered the claimed invention obvious under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 ( 1994 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ III _NEWLINE_ The grant or denial of a preliminary injunction under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 283 ( 1994 ) is within the sound discretion of the district court . Novo Nordisk of N . Am. , Inc. v. Genentech , Inc. , 77 F.3d 1364 , 1367 , 37 USPQ2d 1773 , 1775 ( Fed.Cir.1996 ) . `` An abuse of discretion may be established by showing that the court made a clear error of judgment in weighing relevant factors or exercised its discretion based upon an error of law or clearly erroneous factual findings . '' Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As the moving party , Amazon is entitled to a preliminary injunction if it can succeed in showing : ( 1 ) a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits ; ( 2 ) irreparable harm if an injunction is not granted ; ( 3 ) a balance of hardships tipping in its favor ; and ( 4 ) the injunction 's favorable impact on the public interest . Reebok Int ' l Ltd. v. J. Baker , Inc. , 32 F.3d 1552 , 1555 , 31 USPQ2d 1781 , 1783 ( Fed.Cir.1994 ) . `` These factors , taken individually , are not dispositive ; rather , the district court must weigh and measure each factor against the other factors and against the form and magnitude of the relief requested . '' Hybritech , Inc. v. Abbott Labs. , 849 F.2d 1446 , 1451 , 7 USPQ2d 1191 , 1195 ( Fed.Cir.1988 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Irreparable harm is presumed when a clear showing of patent validity and infringement has been made . Bell & Howell Document Mgmt . Prods . Co. v. Altek Sys. , 132 F.3d 701 , 708 , 45 USPQ2d 1033 , 1039-40 ( Fed.Cir.1997 ) ( citing H.H . Robertson v. United Steel Deck , Inc. , 820 F.2d 384 , 390 , 2 USPQ2d 1926 , 1929-30 ( Fed.Cir.1987 ) ) . `` This presumption derives in part from the finite term of the patent grant , for patent expiration is not suspended during litigation , and the passage of time can work irremediable harm . '' Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Our case law and logic both require that a movant can not be granted a preliminary injunction unless it establishes both of the first two factors , i.e. , likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable harm . Vehicular Techs . Corp. v. Titan Wheel Int ' l , Inc. , 141 F.3d 1084 , 1088 , 46 USPQ2d 1257 , 1259-60 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) ( citing Reebok Int ' l , 32 F.3d at 1555 , 31 USPQ2d at 1783 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In order to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits , Amazon must show that , in light of the presumptions and burdens that will inhere at trial on the merits , ( 1 ) Amazon will likely prove that BN infringes the ¡¬411 patent , and ( 2 ) Amazon 's infringement claim will likely withstand BN 's challenges to the validity and enforceability of the ¡¬411 patent . Genentech , Inc. v. Novo Nordisk , A/S , 108 F.3d 1361 , 1364 , 42 USPQ2d 1001 , 1003 ( Fed.Cir.1997 ) . If BN raises a substantial question concerning either infringement or validity , i.e. , asserts an infringement or invalidity defense that the patentee can not *1351 prove `` lacks substantial merit , '' the preliminary injunction should not issue . Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Of course , whether performed at the preliminary injunction stage or at some later stage in the course of a particular case , infringement and validity analyses must be performed on a claim-by-claim basis . See , e.g. , Bayer AG v. Elan Pharm . Research Corp. , 212 F.3d 1241 , 1247 , 54 USPQ2d 1711 , 1715 ( Fed.Cir.2000 ) ( `` Literal infringement requires the patentee to prove that the accused device contains each limitation of the asserted claim ( s ) . '' ( citations omitted ) ) ; Ortho Pharm . Corp. v. Smith , 959 F.2d 936 , 942 , 22 USPQ2d 1119 , 1124 ( Fed.Cir.1992 ) ( concluding that all grounds of invalidity must be evaluated against individual claims , as required by the plain language of 35 U.S.C . ¡± 282 ( 1994 ) ) . Therefore , in cases involving multiple patent claims , to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits , the patentee must demonstrate that it will likely prove infringement of one or more claims of the patents-in-suit , and that at least one of those same allegedly infringed claims will also likely withstand the validity challenges presented by the accused infringer . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Both infringement and validity are at issue in this appeal . It is well settled that an infringement analysis involves two steps : the claim scope is first determined , and then the properly construed claim is compared with the accused device to determine whether all of the claim limitations are present either literally or by a substantial equivalent . See , e.g. , Young Dental Mfg . Co. v. Q3 Special Prods. , Inc. , 112 F.3d 1137 , 1141 , 42 USPQ2d 1589 , 1592 ( Fed.Cir.1997 ) . Conceptually , the first step of an invalidity analysis based on anticipation and/or obviousness in view of prior art references is no different from that of an infringement analysis . `` It is elementary in patent law that , in determining whether a patent is valid and , if valid , infringed , the first step is to determine the meaning and scope of each claim in suit . '' Lemelson v. Gen.

In particular , BN asserts that the district court construed key claim limitations one way for purposes of its infringement analysis , and another way when considering BN 's validity challenges . *1352 BN asserts that under a consistent claim interpretation , its Express Lane feature either does not infringe the ¡¬411 patent , or that if the patent is interpreted so as to support the charge of infringement , then the claims of the patent are subject to a severe validity challenge . When the key claim limitations are properly interpreted , BN thus asserts , it will be clear that Amazon is not likely to succeed on the merits of its infringement claim , or that BN has succeeded in calling the validity of the ¡¬411 patent into serious question . In addition , BN asserts that the district court misunderstood the teaching of the prior art references , thereby committing clear error in the factual predicates it established for comprehension of the prior art references . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Amazon understandably aligns itself with the district court , asserting that no error of claim interpretation and no clear error in fact-finding has occurred that would undermine the grant of the preliminary injunction . We thus turn to the legal gist of this appeal . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ V _NEWLINE_ It is clear from the district court 's opinion that the meaning it ascribed to the `` single action '' limitation includes a temporal consideration . The `` single action '' to be taken to complete the purchase order , according to the district court , only occurs after other events have transpired . These preliminary events required pursuant to the district court 's claim interpretation are the presentation of a description of the item to be purchased and the presentation of the single action the user must take to complete the purchase order for the item . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Amazon defends this temporal interpretation based on statements made by the applicant during prosecution of the patent . These statements , set forth below , are significant , because they were made at the point in the file history where the claims were amended to include the single action limitation . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In remarks accompanying an amendment dated February 26 , 1999 , Amazon provided the following comments ( not limited to specific claims ) to explain proposed amendments to the claims and to `` clarify that the claimed single-action ordering technology is different from the shopping cart metaphor '' : _NEWLINE_ Applicants ' single action ordering technology facilitates electronic ordering of items by reducing the number of purchaser interactions needed to place an order and reducing the amount of sensitive information that is transmitted between a client computer and a server computer when placing an order . To order an item using single-action ordering technology , the purchaser first locates the item by browsing through a catalog of items , by searching for the item , by selecting a link to the item , or by using any other means for locating the item . Once the item is located , the purchaser need only perform a single action to generate an order for the item and to fulfill that generated order . The single action may be , for example , the selecting of a button that is displayed on the web page or the speaking of a command . Because information ( e.g. , billing and shipping ) about the purchaser has been saved ( e.g. , from a previous purchase ) , that information can be combined with the identification of the located item to generate and fulfill an order when the single action is performed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On its face , this passage from the file history establishes that once a purchaser has located an item by any means , only a single action is required to generate an order for the item . Amazon , however , would put a special reading on the concept of a purchaser locating an item by any means . In Amazon 's view of the file history , a purchaser has not located the item , for the purpose of counting the number of steps thereafter to generate the order , until the purchaser has made the decision to *1353 purchase the item . As applied to the present case , Amazon argues that display of information about an item on BN 's menu page does not indicate an item located with an intent to place the order ; only after one moves from BN 's menu page to its product page has one `` located '' the item for purposes of placing the order by a single action . Since it only takes a single action on BN 's product page to place the order , Amazon contends that BN likely infringes the ¡¬411 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Amazon 's reading of the key passage from the file history injects subjective notions into the infringement analysis . For example , if a would-be purchaser has made the decision to purchase an item before coming to BN 's menu page , and there the purchaser sees the item displayed , Amazon would have to concede that no single action taken after the item display would achieve placement of the order . Instead , the purchaser would need to take a first action to advance from the menu page to the product page , and then a second action to place the order . We are not prepared to assign a meaning to a patent claim that depends on the state of mind of the accused infringer . We thus reject Amazon 's special meaning for the location of an item to be purchased . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ However , as we now discuss in detail , we ultimately agree with Amazon and construe all four independent claims ( i.e. , claims 1 , 6 , 9 , and 11 ) to call for the single action to be performed immediately after a display of information about an item and without any intervening action , but not necessarily immediately after the first display or every display . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Our analysis begins with the plain language of the claims themselves . The term `` single action '' appears in the independent claims of the ¡¬411 patent in the following forms : `` in response to only a single action being performed '' ( claims 1 and 9 ) , `` single-action ordering component '' ( claims 1 , 6 , and 9 ) , `` in response to performance of only a single action '' ( claim 6 ) , `` in response to only the indicated single action being performed '' ( claim 11 ) , and `` displaying an indication of a single action that is to be performed to order the identified item '' ( claim 11 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In claims 1 , 6 , and 11 , the context of the claim makes it clear that the single action is performed after some information about the item is displayed . Claim 1 provides for `` displaying information identifying the item , '' and then immediately recites that `` in response to only a single action being performed , '' a request to purchase the item is sent to a server system . Claim 6 provides for `` a display component for displaying information identifying the item , '' and then immediately recites `` the single action ordering component that in response to performance of only a single action '' sends a request to purchase the item to a server system . Claim 11 provides for `` displaying information identifying the item and displaying an indication of the single action , '' and then immediately recites that `` in response to only the indicated single action being performed '' a request to purchase the item is sent to a server system . The context also indicates that the single action is performed , or is capable of being performed , after information about the item is displayed , without any intervening action . Nothing suggests , however , that the single action must be performed after every display or even immediately after the first display of information . Claim 9 does not explicitly provide for displaying information . It merely recites that a request to order an item is `` sent in response to only a single action being performed . '' However , although claim 9 does not recite `` displaying , '' the written description defines the claim 9 language of `` single action being performed '' to require that information has been displayed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The ordinary meaning of `` single action '' as used in the various claims is straightforward , *1354 but the phrase alone does not indicate when to start counting actions . Therefore , we must look first to the written description of the ¡¬411 patent for further guidance . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The written description supports a construction that after information is `` displayed , '' single-action ordering is an option available to the user , and the counting falls within the scope of the claim when single-action ordering is actually selected by the user . To the extent that the claims are considered ambiguous on this point , the written description defines `` single action '' to require as much . In the Summary of the Invention , the written description describes an embodiment that `` displays information that identifies the item and displays an indication of an action ... [ and ] [ i ] n response to the indicated action being performed '' orders the item . Col. 2 , ll . 54-59 . Similarly , in the Detailed Description of the Invention , the written description states that `` [ o ] nce the description of an item is displayed , the purchaser need only take a single action . '' Col. 3 , ll . 65-66 . This is consistent for all of the disclosed embodiments . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Therefore , neither the written description nor the plain meaning of the claims require that single action ordering be possible after each and every display of information ( or even immediately after the first display of information ) . The plain language of the claims and the written description require only that single action ordering be possible after some display of information . Indeed , the written description allows for and suggests the possibility that previous displays of information will have occurred before the display immediately preceding an order . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Detailed Description of the Invention describes the first figure ( Fig.1A ) by stating that `` this example Web page [ containing a summary description of the item ] was sent ... when the purchaser requested to review detailed information about the item . '' Col. 4 , ll . 7-9 ( emphasis added ) . Given that the written description earlier described on-line purchasing as involving `` browsing '' ( col.1 , l.55 ) , it is reasonable to conclude that some less detailed information about the item has already been displayed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This passage also allows for the possibility that the purchaser sees a display of the less detailed information on an item , decides to browse elsewhere , then ultimately returns to obtain more detailed information on the item and to finally order it . Thus , there could be intermittent displays of information on an item , in addition to successive displays of information on an item , and each and every display need not have single action ordering capability . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The above passages indicate that the written description is not concerned with what happens on every display of information , or even immediately after the first display , but only that there be some display from which single action ordering can be performed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The prosecution history of the ¡¬411 patent also supports the above claim construction . In response to an office action , in the passage from the prosecution history cited earlier in this opinion , the patentee stated `` a purchaser first locates the item [ 1 ] by browsing through a catalog of items , [ 2 ] by searching for the item , [ 3 ] by selecting a link to the item , or [ 4 ] by using any other means for locating the item . Once the item is located , the purchaser need only perform a single action to generate an order '' ( enumeration added ) . This enumeration of the various ways an item may be located allows for information on the item to be displayed prior to single action ordering being enabled . This is seen most clearly in the third enumerated method , `` selecting a link to the item . '' If it is to serve as `` a link to the item '' ( emphasis added ) , then there must be some display of *1355 information on the item either in the link or around the link . Thus , information on the item may sometimes be displayed before `` locating '' the item ( and , hence , before single action ordering is enabled ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Likewise , the first enumerated method ( browsing ) is explained in the written description to entail requesting `` detailed information '' about an item before single action ordering is enabled . This presumes that `` un-detailed '' or general information was previously displayed . Similarly , the second enumerated method ( searching ) commonly entails first displaying information on various items that match a search string , such as a list of all books written by a particular author or dealing with a particular subject . The purchaser than typically selects one of these items to receive more detailed information , at which point the selected item is presumably `` located '' and single action ordering is enabled . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ VI _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A _NEWLINE_ When the correct meaning of the single action limitation is read on the accused BN system , it becomes apparent that the limitations of claim 1 are likely met by the accused system . The evidence on the record concerning the operation of BN 's `` Express Lane '' feature is not in dispute . At the time that the ¡¬411 patent was issued , BN offered customers two purchasing options . One was called `` Shopping Cart , '' and the other was called `` Express Lane . '' The Shopping Cart option involved the steps of adding items to a `` virtual '' shopping cart and then `` checking out '' to complete the purchase . In contrast , the Express Lane option allowed customers who had registered for the feature to purchase items simply by `` clicking '' on the `` Express Lane '' button provided on the `` detail page '' or `` product page '' describing and identifying the book or other item to be purchased . The text beneath the Express Lane button invited users to `` Buy it now with just 1 click ! '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ BN 's allegedly infringing web site thus may be characterized as having `` page 1 , '' ( the `` menu '' page ) which displays a catalog listing several items but which does not contain an `` order '' icon , and `` page 2 , '' ( the `` product '' or `` detail '' page ) which includes information on one item and also shows an order icon . Someone shopping at this web site would look at the catalog on page 1 and perform a first click to go to page 2 . Once at page 2 , a second click on the ordering icon would cause the order request to be sent . Under the claim construction set forth herein , BN likely infringes claim 1 because on page 2 , the item is there displayed ( meeting step 1 of the claim ) and only a single action thereafter causes the order request to be transmitted ( meeting step 2 ) . The method implemented on page 1 of the BN web site does not infringe , but the method on page 2 does . This has nothing to do with the state of mind of the purchaser , but simply reflects the ordinary meaning of the words of the claim in the context of the written description and in light of the prosecution history . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We recognize that under this construction , claim 1 would appear to read on the prior art shopping cart model ( because the final page of a shopping cart model both displays the item to be purchased in a list of selected products and sends the order request signal in response to the single next action of clicking on the `` confirm purchase '' icon ) . However , the shopping cart model is expressly excluded from claim 1 by the whereby clause at the end of the claim . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We note that the district court concluded that `` [ b ] arnesandnoble.com infringes claims 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 11 , 12 , 12 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 21 , 22 , 23 , [ and ] 24 , '' and `` also infringes claims 6-10 of the ¡¬411 patent . '' However , the relevant determination at *1356 the preliminary injunction stage is substantial likelihood of success by Amazon of its infringement claims , not a legal conclusion as to the ultimate issue of infringement . We therefore interpret the district court 's conclusions as determining that Amazon had demonstrated a substantial likelihood of establishing literal infringement of the enumerated claims . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B _NEWLINE_ According to the plain language of claim 2 , the point of reference from which to start `` counting clicks '' does not begin until `` information indicating the single action '' to be performed is displayed ( i.e. , when the `` EXPRESS LANE '' or `` BUY NOW '' button is displayed ) . Amazon is thus correct in its assertion that only a single action is required after that point to send a request to order an item using BN 's Express Lane feature . For this reason , we can not say that BN raised a substantial question of noninfringement of claim 2 in the ¡¬ 411 patent with respect to the `` single action '' limitation at this stage in the litigation . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We point out that BN mounted an additional noninfringement argument with respect to claims 1 , 2 , and 11 based on the term `` shopping cart model '' in the `` whereby '' clause of those claims . Claims 1 and 2 require that the item be ordered `` without using a shopping cart model . '' Similarly , claim 11 requires that the item be ordered `` independently of a shopping cart model . '' Thus , according to BN , even if an ordering system accused of infringement used the claimed `` single action '' technology , it would still not infringe claims 1 , 2 , or 11 so long as the single action technology was used within the paradigm of a `` shopping cart model . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Accordingly , BN argues that , even if its Express Lane feature is said to use single action technology within the scope of the claims in the ¡¬411 patent , the Express Lane feature is nevertheless a `` shopping cart model '' because , according to the written description , `` shopping cart model '' should be construed to include models in which checkout happens automatically when an item is selected for purchase . In fact , the written description of the ¡¬411 patent does mention alternative prior art shopping cart models having the feature that `` when a purchaser selects any one item , then that item is 'checked out ' by automatically prompting the user for the billing and shipment information . '' Col. 2 , ll . 24-27 . Thus , BN argues that its Express Lane system does not infringe because it is an embodiment of such an alternative shopping cart model admitted to be prior art in the written description of the ¡¬411 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court construed `` shopping cart model '' to mean `` a method for on-line ordering in which a user selects and accumulates items to be purchased while browsing a merchant 's site and then must proceed to one or more checkout or confirmation steps in order to complete the purchase . '' BN argues that this interpretation contradicts the written description of the ¡¬411 patent because it allegedly excludes the alternative shopping cart models mentioned in the written description . However , we discern no error with the district court 's interpretation of `` shopping cart model , '' because it is consistent with the written description and with the comments made by Amazon discussing the term during prosecution of the ¡¬411 patent , as discussed earlier with reference to the `` single action '' limitation . The district court 's interpretation does not improperly exclude the alternative shopping cart models mentioned by BN , because although an item may be checked out automatically when using these alternative shopping cart models , the written description states that the user must still provide billing and shipping information ( unless the information is `` pre-filled '' with information that was provided by the user when placing a previous *1357 order ) . Additionally , regardless of whether the `` purchaser-specific order information '' is pre-filled or not , the user must still perform at least one confirmation step once the purchaser is presented with the order web page to complete the purchase . See col. 2 , ll . 24-36 . It follows , then , that BN 's noninfringement argument based on characterizing its Express Lane feature as a `` shopping cart model '' fails because once a purchaser clicks on the `` Express Lane '' ordering button , no additional checkout or confirmation steps are required before a request to order the item is sent to the server system . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Having considered and rejected BN 's alternative noninfringement arguments , we find that Amazon has carried its merits burden with respect to likely infringement of Claim 2 . We note there is some redundancy between claims 1 and 2 under the claim interpretation set forth herein . However , the two claims are not identical in scope . For example , claim 2 would not read on a method where the first page of a web site includes a textual message such as `` click directly on the picture of any item displayed on any of the following pages to place an order . '' Under such a method , there would never be a page where both the item and the single action to be taken to order the item would be displayed . Claim 2 would not be infringed by such a system , but claim 1 would . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ C _NEWLINE_ We note further that Amazon has also made out its likelihood of success case with respect to infringement of claim 11 . Claim 11 is similar to claim 2 because it also includes the limitation requiring `` displaying an indication of a single action that is to be performed . '' For the reasons noted above with respect to claim 2 , the district court was correct in concluding that BN had not raised a substantial question of noninfringement regarding claim 11 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ D _NEWLINE_ In view of our interpretation of `` single action , '' we find that the district court correctly concluded that BN had not raised a substantial question of noninfringement regarding claims 6 and 9 with respect to the `` single action '' limitation . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ However , we note that BN also mounted an additional noninfringement argument with respect to claims 6 and 9 based on the terms `` fulfill '' and `` fulfillment '' in those claims . Claim 6 requires that the server system have the capability to `` fulfill the generated order to complete purchase of the item . '' Similarly , claim 9 requires that the single action ordering component of the server system must include `` an order fulfillment component that completes a purchase of the item . '' BN argues that `` fulfill '' and `` fulfillment '' refer to all of the steps required to pick the product from a warehouse shelf , pack it for shipment , and ship it to the customer . Presumably , BN believes that such an interpretation would lead to noninfringement of claims 6 and 9 , at least under a theory of direct infringement . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court ruled that the various forms of `` fulfill '' throughout the claims refer to order fulfillment application software executing on the server system , as opposed to the physical steps of handling or packing tangible items . We discern no error with this interpretation . As BN admits , the plain language of claims 6 and 9 require that the fulfillment steps be capable of being performed by the server system ( as in claim 6 ) and that the order fulfillment component be part of the server system ( as in claim 9 ) . Obviously a server system , as the term is used in the ¡¬411 patent to refer to a computer system ( see , e.g. , col. 1 , ll . 15-16 ) , is incapable of picking a product from a warehouse shelf , packing it for shipment , and shipping it to the customer . Therefore the terms `` fulfill '' and its cognates are properly limited to *1358 refer to order fulfillment application software executed on the server system . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ E _NEWLINE_ After full review of the record before us , we conclude that under a proper claim interpretation , Amazon has made the showing that it is likely to succeed at trial on its infringement case . Given that we conclude that Amazon has demonstrated likely literal infringement of at least the four independent claims in the ¡¬411 patent , we need not consider infringement under the doctrine of equivalents . The question remaining , however , is whether the district court correctly determined that BN failed to mount a substantial challenge to the validity of the claims in the ¡¬411 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ VII _NEWLINE_ The district court considered , but ultimately rejected , the potentially invalidating impact of several prior art references cited by BN . Because the district court determined that BN likely infringed all of the asserted claims , it did not focus its analysis of the validity issue on any particular claim . Instead , in its validity analysis , the district court appears to have primarily directed its attention to determining whether the references cited by BN implemented the single action limitation . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ At the preliminary injunction stage of the litigation , the district court sits to deliver an equitable determination , and issues of fact naturally play into the final judgment of the district court . For example , in an invalidity analysis , the district court must assess the meaning of the prior art references cited to support the validity challenge . However , what a reference teaches is a question of fact . In re Beattie , 974 F.2d 1309 , 1311 , 24 USPQ2d 1040 , 1041-42 ( Fed.Cir.1992 ) . Consequently , the district court necessarily makes fact-findings , explicitly or implicitly , concerning the meaning of the asserted references . On the basis of the district court 's reading of the references , it makes judgments as to the validity of the patent in suit . We review the district court 's assessment of the prior art references for clear error . See id . ; Novo Nordisk , 77 F.3d at 1367 , 37 USPQ2d at 1775 ( Fed.Cir.1996 ) ( stating that an abuse of discretion in granting a preliminary injunction may be established by showing that the court made a clear error of judgment in weighing relevant factors or exercised its discretion based upon an error of law or clearly erroneous factual findings ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In this case , we find that the district court committed clear error by misreading the factual content of the prior art references cited by BN and by failing to recognize that BN had raised a substantial question of invalidity of the asserted claims in view of these prior art references . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Validity challenges during preliminary injunction proceedings can be successful , that is , they may raise substantial questions of invalidity , on evidence that would not suffice to support a judgment of invalidity at trial . See , e.g. , Helifix Ltd. v. Blok-Lok , Ltd. , 208 F.3d 1339 , 1352 , 54 USPQ2d 1299 , 1308 ( Fed.Cir.2000 ) ( holding that the allegedly anticipatory prior art references sufficiently raised a question of invalidity to deny a preliminary injunction , even though summary judgment of anticipation based on the same references was not supported ) . The test for invalidity at trial is by evidence that is clear and convincing . WMS Gaming , Inc. v. Int ' l Game Tech. , 184 F.3d 1339 , 1355 , 51 USPQ2d 1385 , 1396-97 ( Fed.Cir.1999 ) . To succeed with a summary judgment motion of invalidity , for example , the movant must demonstrate a lack of genuine dispute about material facts and show that the facts not in dispute are clear and convincing in demonstrating *1359 invalidity . Robotic Vision Sys. , Inc. v. View Eng ' g , Inc. , 112 F.3d 1163 , 1165 , 42 USPQ2d 1619 , 1621 ( Fed.Cir.1997 ) . In resisting a preliminary injunction , however , one need not make out a case of actual invalidity . Vulnerability is the issue at the preliminary injunction stage , while validity is the issue at trial . The showing of a substantial question as to invalidity thus requires less proof than the clear and convincing showing necessary to establish invalidity itself . That this is so is plain from our cases . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ When moving for the extraordinary relief of a preliminary injunction , a patentee need not establish the validity of a patent beyond question . Atlas Powder Co. v. Ireco Chems. , 773 F.2d , 1230 , 1233 , 227 USPQ 289 , 292 ( Fed.Cir.1985 ) . The patentee must , however , present a clear case supporting the validity of the patent in suit . See Nutrition 21 v. United States , 930 F.2d 867 , 871 , 18 USPQ2d 1347 , 1349 ( Fed.Cir.1991 ) . Such a case might be supported , for example , by showing that the patent in suit had successfully withstood previous validity challenges in other proceedings . Further support for such a clear case might come from a long period of industry acquiescence in the patent 's validity . See 7 Donald S. Chisum , Chisum on Patents ¡± 20.04 [ 1 ] [ c ] , at 20-673 to 20-693 ( 1998 ) ( citing cases ) . Neither of those considerations benefit Amazon in this case , however , because the ¡¬411 patent has yet to be tested by trial , and it was issued only a few weeks before the start of this litigation . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In Helifix , we recently confronted the situation in which a district court had granted a motion of summary judgment of invalidity based on allegedly anticipatory prior art references , and shortly thereafter denied a motion for a preliminary injunction based on a validity challenge using the same prior art references . 208 F.3d at 1344-45 , 54 USPQ2d at 1302 . On appeal , the patentee sought reversal of the summary judgment and claimed entitlement to a preliminary injunction . We held that the summary judgment could not stand , because disputed issues of material fact on invalidity remained for resolution at trial . Id . at 208 F.3d 1352 , 54 USPQ2d 1308 . Nonetheless , we expressly held that the quantum of evidence put forth-while falling short of demonstrating invalidity itself-was sufficient to prevent issuance of the preliminary injunction . Id . Particularly instructive for purposes of this case is the treatment of the anticipation issue in Helifix . A particular reference which did not on its face disclose all the limitations of the claim in suit was argued to be anticipatory , even though there was a conflict in the testimony as to whether the reference would have taught one of ordinary skill in the art the claim limitations not expressly stated on the face of the reference . Although insufficient to demonstrate invalidity for the purposes of the summary judgment motion , the reference was enough to prevent issuance of the preliminary injunction . Id . at 208 F.3d 1351-52 , 54 USPQ2d at 1307-08 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The situation before us is similar . Here , we have several references that were urged upon the court as invalidating the asserted claims . The district court dismissed those references , for purposes of its invalidity analysis , because it did not perceive them to recite each and every limitation of the claims in suit . As we explain below in our review of the asserted prior art in this case , each of the asserted references clearly teaches key limitations of the claims of the patent in suit . BN argued to the district court that one of ordinary skill in the art could fill in the gaps in the asserted references , given the opportunity to do so at trial . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ When the heft of the asserted prior art is assessed in light of the correct legal standards , we conclude that BN has *1360 mounted a serious challenge to the validity of Amazon 's patent . We hasten to add , however , that this conclusion only undermines the prerequisite for entry of a preliminary injunction . Our decision today on the validity issue in no way resolves the ultimate question of invalidity . That is a matter for resolution at trial . It remains to be learned whether there are other references that may be cited against the patent , and it surely remains to be learned whether any shortcomings in BN 's initial preliminary validity challenge will be magnified or dissipated at trial . All we hold , in the meantime , is that BN cast enough doubt on the validity of the ¡¬411 patent to avoid a preliminary injunction , and that the validity issue should be resolved finally at trial . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A _NEWLINE_ One of the references cited by BN was the `` CompuServe Trend System . '' The undisputed evidence indicates that in the mid-1990s , CompuServe offered a service called `` Trend '' whereby CompuServe subscribers could obtain stock charts for a surcharge of 50 cents per chart . Before the district court , BN argued that this system anticipated claim 11 of the ¡¬411 patent . The district court failed to recognize the substantial question of invalidity raised by BN in citing the CompuServe Trend reference , in that this system appears to have used `` single action ordering technology '' within the scope of the claims in the ¡¬411 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ First , the district court dismissed the significance of this system partly on the basis that `` [ t ] he CompuServe system was not a world wide web application . '' This distinction is irrelevant , since none of the claims mention either the Internet or the World Wide Web ( with the possible exception of dependent claim 15 , which mentions HTML , a program commonly associated with both the Internet and the World Wide Web ) . Moreover , the ¡¬411 patent specification explicitly notes that `` [ o ] ne skilled in the art would appreciate that the single-action ordering techniques can be used in various environments other than the Internet . '' Col. 6 , ll . 22-24 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ More importantly , one of the screen shots in the record ( reproduced below ) indicates that with the CompuServe Trend system , once the `` item '' to be purchased ( i.e. , a stock chart ) has been displayed ( by typing in a valid stock symbol ) , only a single action ( i.e. , a single mouse click on the button labeled `` C hart ( $ .50 ) '' ) is required to obtain immediate electronic delivery ( i.e. , `` fulfillment '' ) of the item . Once the button labeled `` C hart ( $ .50 ) '' was activated by a purchaser , an electronic version of the requested stock chart would be transmitted to the purchaser and displayed on the purchaser 's computer screen , and an automatic process to charge the purchaser 's account 50 cents for the transaction would be initiated . In terms of the language of claims 2 and 11 in the CompuServe Trend system , the item to be ordered is `` displayed '' when the screen echoes back the characters of the stock symbol typed in by the purchaser before clicking on the ordering button . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1361 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ? _NEWLINE_ The evidence before us indicates that the billing process for the electronic stock chart would not actually commence until the client system sent a message to the server system indicating that the electronic stock chart had been received at the client system . In its brief , Amazon argues that this feature of the CompuServe Trend system amounts to an additional `` confirmation step necessary to complete the ordering process , '' and that the CompuServe Trend system therefore does not use `` single action '' technology within the scope of the claims in the ¡¬411 patent . However , all of the claims only require sending a request to order an item in response to performance of only a single action . In the CompuServe Trend system , this requirement is satisfied when a purchaser performs the single action of `` clicking '' on the button labeled `` C hart ( $ .50 ) . '' The claims do not require that the billing process for the item must also be initiated in response to performance of the single action . Furthermore , in the CompuServe Trend system , the `` action '' of sending a message from the client system to the server system confirming successful reception of the electronic stock chart is performed automatically , without user intervention . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ At oral argument , Amazon 's counsel articulated three differences between the CompuServe Trend system and the claimed invention . First , Amazon 's counsel repeated the district court 's reasoning , and asserted that the CompuServe Trend system is not on the Internet or the World Wide Web . As mentioned above , the ¡¬ 411 patent specification indicates that this distinction is irrelevant . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Second , Amazon 's counsel claimed that the CompuServe Trend system was different from the claims of the ¡¬411 patent because it required a user to `` log in '' at the beginning of each session , and therefore would not send the claimed `` identifier '' along with a request to purchase each item . However , claim 11 does not require transmission of an identifier along with a request to order an item . This requirement *1362 is found only in claims 1 , 6 , and 9 , and their respective dependent claims . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On its face , the CompuServe Trend reference does not mention transmission of the claimed identifier along with a request to purchase each item . Nor does the evidence in the record at this stage indicate that the CompuServe Trend system transmitted such an identifier . BN has therefore not demonstrated that the CompuServe Trend reference anticipates the asserted claims of the ¡¬411 patent requiring transmission of such an identifier with the degree of precision necessary to obtain summary judgment on this point . However , as noted above , validity challenges during preliminary injunction proceedings can be successful on evidence that would not suffice to support a judgment of invalidity at trial . See Helifix , 208 F.3d at 1352 , 54 USPQ2d at 1308 . The record in this case is simply not yet developed to the point where a determination can be made whether the CompuServe Trend system transmits the claimed identifier along with a request to order an item , or whether this limitation is obvious in view of the prior art . For example , United States Patent No . 5,708,780 ( `` the ¡¬780 patent '' ) ( a reference cited by BN which is discussed more fully below ) , describes `` forwarding a service request from the client to the server and appending a session identification ( SID ) to the request and to subsequent service requests from the client to the server within a session of requests . '' See ¡¬780 patent , col. 3 , ll . 12-16 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Moreover , the ¡¬411 patent specification itself dismisses the distinction between ordering systems in which an identifier is transmitted along with each request to order an item , and systems in which a user logs in once at the beginning of each session . See ¡¬411 patent at col. 10 , ll . 6-10 ( `` [ T ] he purchaser can be alternatively identified by a unique customer identifier that is provided by the customer when the customer initiates access to the server system and sent to the server system with each message. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The final distinction drawn by Amazon 's counsel between the claimed invention and the CompuServe Trend system was that-according to Amazon-the only reason that a purchaser would `` call up '' the screen would be to actually order an electronic stock chart , and that therefore an earlier action taken by a purchaser to invoke the screen should count as an extra purchaser action . According to this argument , the CompuServe Trend system would not meet the `` single action '' limitation because at least two actions would need to be taken to order an item : one action to invoke the ordering screen , and a second action to click on the ordering button . However , as the screen shot plainly indicates , a purchaser could use the display screen for purposes other than to order an electronic stock chart ( e.g. , to `` L ookup '' a stock symbol ) . Furthermore , to the extent that Amazon argues that the CompuServe Trend fails to meet the `` single action '' limitation due to the `` click '' necessary to activate the stock chart ordering screen in the first place , Amazon also admits that BN 's Express Lane feature fails to meet the same limitation because of the `` click '' required to proceed from a menu page to a product page when using the Express Lane feature . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As the CompuServe Trend stock chart ordering screen indicates , we note that once a purchaser types in a valid stock symbol , the screen displays both `` information identifying the item '' ( i.e. , the stock symbol identifying the desired electronic stock chart ) and an indication of the `` single action '' to be performed to order the identified item ( i.e. , clicking on the button labeled `` C hart ( $ .50 ) '' ) . Therefore , the substantial question of invalidity raised by the CompuServe Trend reference is the same regardless of whether one considers claims explicitly requiring that both of *1363 these pieces of information be displayed ( i.e. , claims 2 and 11 ) or claims requiring that only the `` information identifying the item '' be displayed ( i.e. , claims 1 , 6 , and 9 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In view of the above , we conclude that the district court erred in failing to recognize that the CompuServe Trend reference raises a substantial question of invalidity . Whether the CompuServe Trend reference either anticipates and/or renders obvious the claimed invention in view of the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the relevant art is a matter for decision at trial . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B _NEWLINE_ In addition to the CompuServe Trend system , other prior art references were cited by BN , but ultimately rejected by the district court . For example , BN 's expert , Dr. Lockwood , testified that he developed an on-line ordering system called `` Web Basket '' in or around August 1996 . The Web Basket system appears to be an embodiment of a `` shopping cart ordering component '' : it requires users to accumulate items into a virtual shopping basket and to check these items out when they are finished shopping . Because it is an implementation of a shopping cart model , Web Basket requires several confirmation steps for even pre-registered users to complete their purchases . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ However , despite the fact that Web-Basket is an embodiment of a shopping cart model , it is undisputed that Web-Basket implemented the Internet Engineering Task Force ( `` IETF '' ) draft `` cookie '' specification , and stored a customer identifier in a cookie for use by a web server to retrieve information from a database . In other words , when a user first visited the Web-Basket site , a cookie ( i.e. , a file stored by the server system on the client system for subsequent use ) was used to store an identifier on the user 's computer . The first time that a user purchased an item on the Web Basket site , the information entered by the user necessary to complete the purchase ( e.g. , name , address ) would be stored in a database on the server system indexed by an identifier stored in the cookie on the client system . On subsequent visits , the cookie could be used to retrieve the user identifier , which would serve as the key to retrieve the user 's information from the database on the server system . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ At the preliminary injunction stage , based on Dr. Lockwood 's declaration and testimony during the hearing , BN argued that the Web Basket reference-combined with the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art at the relevant time-renders obvious the claimed invention.1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court concluded that the Web Basket system was `` inconsistent with the single-action requirements of the ¡¬411 patent '' because `` it requires a multiple-step ordering process from the time that an item to be purchased is displayed . '' However , as discussed earlier , the undisputed evidence demonstrates that the accused BN Express Lane feature also requires a multiple-step ordering process ( i.e. , at least two `` clicks '' ) from the time that an item to be purchased is first displayed on the menu page , yet the district court concluded that BN 's Express Lane feature infringed all of the asserted claims of the ¡¬411 patent . The district court 's failure to recognize the inconsistency in these two conclusions was erroneous . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Moreover , the district court did not address the `` cookie '' aspects of the Web Basket reference , and failed to recognize *1364 that a reasonable jury could find that the step of storing purchaser data on the server system for subsequent retrieval indexed by an identifier transmitted from the client system was anticipated and/or rendered obvious by the Web Basket reference . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court dismissed BN 's obviousness defense , apparently based on an alleged `` admission '' by BN 's expert . In a section of its opinion entitled `` Summary of Prior Art , '' the district court stated : _NEWLINE_ On the question of obviousness , the Court finds that the differences between the prior art references submitted by Defendants and the ¡¬411 patent claims are significant . Moreover , there is insufficient evidence in the record regarding a teaching , suggestion , or motivation in the prior art that would lead one of ordinary skill in the art of e-commerce to combine the references . The Court finds particularly telling Dr. Lockwood 's admission that it never occurred to him to modify his Web Basket program to enable single-action ordering , despite his testimony that such a modification would be easy to implement . This admission serves to negate Dr. Lockwood 's conclusory statements that prior art references teach to one of ordinary skill in the art the invention of the ¡¬411 patent . _NEWLINE_ Thus , the district court apparently based its conclusion of nonobviousness on Dr. Lockwood 's `` admission '' that he personally never thought of combining or modifying the prior art to come up with the claimed `` single action '' invention . This approach was erroneous as a matter of law . Whatever Dr. Lockwood did or did not personally realize at the time based on his actual knowledge is irrelevant . The relevant inquiry is what a hypothetical ordinarily skilled artisan would have gleaned from the cited references at the time that the patent application leading to the ¡¬411 patent was filed . See Kimberly-Clark Corp. v. Johnson & Johnson , 745 F.2d 1437 , 1453 , 223 USPQ 603 , 612-14 ( Fed.Cir.1984 ) ( discussing the origin and significance of the hypothetical ordinarily skilled artisan in detail ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ C _NEWLINE_ BN also presented as a prior art reference an excerpt from a book written by Magdalena Yesil entitled Creating the Virtual Store that was copyrighted in 1996 . Before the district court , BN argued that this reference anticipated every limitation of claim 11 . Before this court , BN also alleges that many other claim limitations are disclosed in the reference , but that there was insufficient time to prepare testimony concerning these limitations , given the district court 's accelerated briefing and hearing schedule at the preliminary injunction stage . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In general terms , the reference apparently discusses software to implement a shopping cart ordering model . However , BN focuses on the following passage from Appendix F of the book : _NEWLINE_ Instant Buy Option _NEWLINE_ Merchants also can provide shoppers with an Instant Buy button for some or all items , enabling them to skip check out review . This provides added appeal for customers who already know the single item they want to purchase during their shopping excursion . _NEWLINE_ The district court dismissed the significance of this passage , stating that `` [ r ] ead in context , the few lines relied on by Defendants appear to describe only the elimination of the checkout review step , leaving at least two other required steps to complete a purchase . '' However , the district court failed to recognize that a reasonable jury could find that this passage provides a motivation to modify shopping cart ordering software to skip unnecessary steps . *1365 Thus , we find that this passage , viewed in light of the rest of the reference and the other prior art references cited by BN , raises a substantial question of validity with respect to the asserted claims of the ¡¬ 411 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ D _NEWLINE_ Another reference cited by BN , a print-out from a web page describing the `` Oliver 's Market '' ordering system , generally describes a prior art multi-step shopping cart model . BN argued that this reference anticipates at least claim 9 . The reference begins with an intriguing sentence : _NEWLINE_ A single click on its picture is all it takes to order an item . _NEWLINE_ Read in context , the quote emphasizes how easy it is to order things on-line . The district court failed to recognize that a reasonable jury could find that this sentence provides a motivation to modify a shopping cart model to implement `` single-click '' ordering as claimed in the ¡¬411 patent . In addition , the district court failed to recognize that other passages from this reference could be construed by a reasonable jury as anticipating and/or rendering obvious the allegedly novel `` single action ordering technology '' of the ¡¬411 patent . For example , the reference states that `` [ o ] ur solution allows one-click ordering anywhere you see a product picture or a price . '' The reference also describes a system in which a user 's identifying information ( e.g. , username and password ) and purchasing information ( e.g. , name , phone number , payment method , delivery address ) is captured and stored in a database `` the very first time a user clicks on an item to order , '' and in which a corresponding cookie is stored on the client system . In this system , the stored information may be retrieved automatically during subsequent visits by reading the cookie . All of these passages further support BN 's argument that a substantial question of validity is raised by this prior art reference , either alone or in combination with the other cited references . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ E _NEWLINE_ The final reference considered by the district court is the ¡¬ 780 patent , entitled `` Internet server access control and monitoring systems . '' Based on a patent application filed in the United States before the application that matured into Amazon 's ¡¬411 patent , the ¡¬780 patent qualifies as prior art pursuant to 35 U.S.C . ¡± 102 ( e ) ( 1994 ) . Before the district court , BN argued that this reference anticipated at least claim 1 of the ¡¬411 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In the preferred embodiment described in the ¡¬780 patent , a user browses the web conventionally , and a content server provides web documents to the user and determines when the user seeks access to `` controlled '' content , i.e. , web pages for which the user needs authorization to browse . ¡¬780 patent , col. 7 , ll . 35-38 . The ¡¬780 patent describes a system in which controlled pages are returned to the user 's browser when an authorized request is received by the content server . We note that the ¡¬780 patent describes `` forwarding a service request from the client to the server and appending a session identification ( SID ) to the request and to subsequent service requests from the client to the server within a session of requests . '' Id . at col. 3 , ll . 12-16 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We conclude that the district court failed to recognize that a reasonable jury could find that such `` items '' ( i.e. , controlled pages ) fall within the scope of the claimed invention , and that delivery of these controlled pages based on receiving an authorized request from a user 's browser may constitute a `` single action ordering component '' within the meaning of the claims in the ¡¬411 patent . Therefore , the ¡¬780 patent is yet another prior art reference cited by BN which tends to raise a substantial *1366 question of validity , either alone or in combination with the other cited references . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court also cited certain `` secondary considerations '' to support its conclusion of nonobviousness . Specifically , the district court cited ( 1 ) `` copying of the invention '' by BN and other e-commerce retailers following Amazon 's introduction of its `` 1-Click ( r ) '' feature , and ( 2 ) `` the need to solve the problem of abandoned shopping carts . '' First , we note that evidence of copying Amazon 's `` 1-Click ( r ) '' feature is legally irrelevant unless the `` 1-Click ( r ) '' feature is shown to be an embodiment of the claims . To the extent Amazon can demonstrate that its `` 1-Click ( r ) '' feature embodies any asserted claims of the ¡¬411 patent under the correct claim interpretation , evidence of copying by BN and others is not sufficient to demonstrate nonobviousness of the claimed invention , in view of the substantial question of validity raised by the prior art references cited by BN and discussed herein . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ With respect to the abandoned shopping carts , this problem is not even mentioned in the ¡¬411 patent . Moreover , Amazon did not submit any evidence to show either that its commercial success was related to the `` 1-Click ( r ) '' ordering feature , or that single-action ordering caused a reduction in the number of abandoned shopping carts . Therefore , we fail to see how this `` consideration '' supports Amazon 's nonobviousness argument . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ CONCLUSION _NEWLINE_ While it appears on the record before us that Amazon has carried its burden with respect to demonstrating the likelihood of success on infringement , it is also true that BN has raised substantial questions as to the validity of the ¡¬411 patent . For that reason , we must conclude that the necessary prerequisites for entry of a preliminary injunction are presently lacking . We therefore vacate the preliminary injunction and remand the case for further proceedings . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ COSTS _NEWLINE_ VACATED AND REMANDED _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 239 F.3d 1343 , 57 U.S.P.Q.2d 1747 _NEWLINE_ Footnotes _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On appeal , BN asserts that a defense of anticipation had been raised based on the Web Basket system by Dr. Lockwood 's claim charts . However , our review of the record indicates that Dr. Lockwood admitted that at least one claim limitation in each of the independent claims may not have been anticipated by the Web Basket system . Therefore , at this stage , we address only the obviousness issues related to the Web Basket system . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_

The United States District Court for the District of Idaho , B. Lynn Winmill , Chief Judge , 2014 WL 713532 , denied motions . Cross-appeals were taken . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Holdings : The Court of Appeals , Taranto , Circuit Judge , held that : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ substantial evidence supported determinations that claims in patents related to radar detectors for detecting police signals were invalid ; _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ inventor 's testimony of prior invention was sufficiently corroborated ; and _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ patentee established error prerequisite for reissue patents . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Affirmed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Attorneys and Law Firms _NEWLINE_ *1373 Michael S.

The jury found for the patentee on infringement and validity as to most of the asserted claims , but it invalidated five claims . The patentee , Hoyt Fleming , appeals the five invalidity determinations , arguing that ( 1 ) the testimony offered to establish invalidity was insufficiently specific to support the verdict ; ( 2 ) there was insufficient corroboration of the prior invention relied on for the invalidity determinations ; and ( 3 ) the prior invention , if it existed , was abandoned , suppressed , or concealed , disqualifying it from invalidating the claims . The adjudicated infringers , Escort , Inc. , and Beltronics USA , Inc. ( collectively , Escort ) , cross-appeal on the ground that all of the asserted claims are invalid because Fleming 's reason for seeking reissue did not meet the `` error '' precondition for obtaining reissue . We affirm . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ BACKGROUND _NEWLINE_ Hoyt Fleming owns two reissue patents-U.S. Patent Nos . RE39,038 ( issued Mar . 28 , 2006 ) and RE40,653 ( issued Mar . 10 , 2009 ) -issued under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 251 . Both relate to radar detectors for detecting police signals . They claim methods for incorporating , as well as apparatuses that *1374 incorporate , a Global Positioning Satellite ( GPS ) unit into a radar detector . The incorporated GPS can reduce false alarms ( i.e. , the signaling of a police presence when none exists ) by allowing the detector to disregard , or `` lock out , '' certain signals from an identified location known to produce such false alarms ( e.g. , a storefront door opener transmitting a radar signal that can be mistaken for a police presence ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Claim 1 of the ¡¬038 patent is representative of the method claims . It reads : _NEWLINE_ 1 . A method , executed by a device having a position , of generating an alert to an incoming radar signal having a frequency and a signal strength , the method comprising the acts of : _NEWLINE_ ( a ) detecting the incoming radar signal ; _NEWLINE_ ( b ) determining the position of the device that detected the incoming radar signal ; and _NEWLINE_ ( c ) generating an alert if the position of the device is not within a predetermined distance of a predetermined position . _NEWLINE_ ¡¬038 patent , col. 6 , lines 49-58 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Claim 18 of the ¡¬038 patent is representative of the apparatus claims . It reads : _NEWLINE_ 18 . A radar detector for alerting an operator of a motor vehicle to an incoming police radar signal comprising : _NEWLINE_ ( a ) a microprocessor ; _NEWLINE_ ( b ) a circuit coupled to the microprocessor for detecting the incoming police radar signal ; and _NEWLINE_ ( c ) a global positioning system receiver coupled to the microprocessor and operable to provide the microprocessor with data that indicates the position of the radar detector . _NEWLINE_ ¡¬038 patent , col. 7 , lines 53-61 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On March 10 , 2009 , Fleming sued Escort for infringement of his two patents . At the heart of Escort 's defenses was the contention that Steven Orr , who works for Escort as a consultant , had invented a GPS-incorporating radar detector before Fleming did-a prior invention Escort invoked to support anticipation and obviousness challenges under 35 U.S.C . ¡±¡± 102 ( g ) and 103 ( 2006 ) .1 Fleming 's claimed priority date is April 14 , 1999-the filing date of his original patent application . Orr alleged that he conceived his invention in 1988 and made a working embodiment that reduced it to practice in April 1996 . From 1988 to 1996 , Orr was working at Cincinnati Microwave , which owned the potential patent rights to the alleged invention at issue . Cincinnati Microwave entered bankruptcy on February 14 , 1997 . With Orr assisting in the bankruptcy process , Escort acquired Cincinnati Microwave 's assets , including the potential patent rights to the alleged Orr invention , during the summer of 1997 . Escort sought Orr 's assistance in the new enterprise , and Orr began working at Escort in July 1998 . He filed a patent application to claim his alleged invention , with Escort as assignee , on June 14 , 1999 , two months after Fleming filed his application . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The jury in this case found most of Fleming 's asserted claims to be infringed by Escort and not to be invalid . It found invalidity , however , as to five claims of the ¡¬038 patent-claims 1 , 18 , 45 , 47 , and 48 . The jury invalidated claim 45 as anticipated *1375 by Orr 's prior invention . It invalidated claim 18 as anticipated by the Orr invention and also for obviousness in light of Orr 's invention and two prior-art patents , Hoffberg ( U.S. Patent No . 6,252,544 ) and Ross ( U.S. Patent No . 5,977,884 ) . And it invalidated claims 1 , 47 , and 48 for obviousness in light of Orr 's prior invention and two prior-art patents , Hoffberg and Valentine ( U.S. Patent No . 5,146,226 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Fleming subsequently sought judgment as a matter of law to reverse the jury 's five invalidity determinations . He argued that the testimony regarding invalidity was conclusory , that Orr 's testimony regarding his prior invention was insufficiently corroborated , and that Orr 's prior invention-even if it existed-had been abandoned , suppressed , or concealed within the meaning of 35 U.S.C . ¡± 102 ( g ) ( 2 ) , disqualifying it as a basis for invalidity . Escort , in turn , sought judgment that Fleming 's patents were invalid , arguing that Fleming had not identified an `` error '' in his original patent ( U.S. Patent No . 6,204,798 ) , a prerequisite to securing a reissue patent under section 251 . The district court denied both sides ' motions . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Both parties appeal the district court 's decision . We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C . ¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ DISCUSSION _NEWLINE_ We review the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo , applying the same standards as did the district court in deciding whether the jury verdict must be reversed . See Enovsys LLC v. Nextel Commc'ns , Inc. , 614 F.3d 1333 , 1341 ( Fed.Cir.2010 ) ( applying Ninth Circuit law ) . In doing so , we accept express or implied jury factual determinations , if supported by substantial evidence , and assess whether those facts support the judgment under the governing legal standards , whose interpretation we review de novo . See , e.g. , Baxter Healthcare Corp. v. Spectramed , Inc. , 49 F.3d 1575 , 1582 ( Fed.Cir.1995 ) ( applying Ninth Circuit law ) ; Pierce v. Underwood , 487 U.S. 552 , 558 , 108 S.Ct . 2541 , 101 L.Ed.2d 490 ( 1988 ) . `` Substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as reasonable minds might accept as adequate to support a conclusion even if it is possible to draw two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence . '' Landes Const . Co. , Inc. v. Royal Bank of Can. , 833 F.2d 1365 , 1371 ( 9th Cir.1987 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 _NEWLINE_ Fleming 's first contention on appeal from the five invalidity verdicts is that Escort 's evidence in support of invalidity was insufficiently specific to support the verdict . Fleming 's argument invokes our rulings that `` [ g ] eneral and conclusory testimony ... does not suffice as substantial evidence of invalidity . '' Koito Mfg . Co. v. Turn-Key-Tech , LLC , 381 F.3d 1142 , 1152 ( Fed.Cir.2004 ) ; see CytoLogix Corp. v. Ventana Med . Sys. , Inc. , 424 F.3d 1168 , 1176 ( Fed.Cir.2005 ) ; Motorola , Inc. v. Interdigital Tech . Corp. , 121 F.3d 1461 , 1473 ( Fed.Cir.1997 ) . It is not enough simply to introduce a prior-art reference into the record , with no testimony showing where the limitations of the claims are to be found . Koito , 381 F.3d at 1151-52 ; see also Fresenius USA , Inc. v. Baxter Int ' l , Inc. , 582 F.3d 1288 , 1300 ( Fed.Cir.2009 ) . In this case , the principal prior art was not a patent or publication but the prior invention of Orr , who testified extensively about it . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We conclude that there was sufficiently specific factual support for the invalidity determinations . The jury 's verdict on invalidity rested on two overlapping classes of findings . The first concerned Orr 's prior invention , which the jury found *1376 to anticipate claims 18 and 45-a question of fact . TI Grp . Auto . Sys . ( N . Am . ) , Inc. v. VDO N . Am. , LLC , 375 F.3d 1126 , 1133 ( Fed.Cir.2004 ) . The second concerned the teachings of the asserted combinations of Orr 's prior invention and Hoffberg , Ross , and/or Valentine . The content of those teachings and the motivation to combine are fact questions , see Kinetic Concepts , Inc. v. Smith & Nephew , Inc. , 688 F.3d 1342 , 1360 , 1367 ( Fed.Cir.2012 ) , which we assume the jury answered in Escort 's favor in finding claims 1 , 18 , 47 , and 48 invalid for obviousness . Sufficiently specific evidence supported the jury 's findings . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The invalidated claims do not contain a large number of limitations , so extensive testimony was not required . Nevertheless , Orr and Escort 's expert , Dr. Grindon , together provided testimony that explained how the prior art taught the limitations of each invalidated claim . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ For example , claim 45 recites two limitations : ( 1 ) `` a circuit operable to detect an incoming radar signal '' and ( 2 ) `` a microprocessor operable to disable an alert to the incoming radar signal based at least in part upon the position of the radar detector . '' ¡¬038 patent , col. 10 , lines 24-30 . As to the first limitation , Orr explained that part of his invention consisted of a radar detector that received frequency information , allowing the detection of radar signals . J.A . 6198 . As to the second limitation , Orr explained that the radar detector was connected to a GPS navigational card and a laptop , allowing the muting of certain signals `` when [ he ] hit the spacebar '' based on position information expressed in cylindrical coordinates . J.A . 6198 . As to both limitations , Dr. Grindon evaluated evidence of Orr 's prior invention , including files that showed `` routes that [ Orr ] took driving around under different conditions to collect ... position and velocity information from a GPS device in his car , '' J.A . 6324 , and explained that Orr 's invention `` definitely shows and discloses ... the combination for a radar detector with a GPS system ... combined with a processor , in this case a laptop computer ... [ to ] suppress [ ] ... false alerts ... based upon location ... [ and ] the speed of the car ... [ by ] press [ ing ] the space bar on the laptop , '' J.A . 6325 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ With regard to the other invalidated claims , Dr. Grindon testified in some detail to the aspects of Hoffberg , Ross , and Valentine-as well as the motivation to combine-that would have made the claimed subject matter obvious at the relevant time . E.g. , J.A . 6328-29 ( describing how Hoffberg `` teach [ es ] ... radar detection ... in ... various frequency bands '' and `` stor [ ing ] information ... to discriminate against false alarms '' ) ; J.A . 6330-31 ( describing how Ross `` integrat [ es ] a system with a radar detector and a GPS , and then a processor ... [ to ] address [ ] the same problem of false alarms and false alerts '' through a comparison of `` [ t ] he speed of the vehicle , which is derived from the GPS unit , ... with [ a ] preset maximum '' ) ; J.A . 6332-33 ( describing how Valentine `` address [ es ] the problem of false alerts in a very similar , but slightly different , way [ from Hoffberg ] , '' by `` discriminat [ ing ] the signals based on frequency ... in the same way [ as Orr 's prior invention ] '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In light of this and other testimony , we can not say that the invalidity challenge was supported by only conclusory testimony and unexplained prior-art documents . There was specific evidence sufficient to support the verdict . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 2 _NEWLINE_ Fleming also challenges the proof of Orr 's prior invention by invoking the principle that `` oral testimony by an alleged inventor asserting priority over a *1377 patentee 's rights ... must be supported by some type of corroborating evidence . '' Woodland Trust v. Flowertree Nursery , Inc. , 148 F.3d 1368 , 1371 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) ( citation and internal quotation marks omitted ) . Such evidence is evaluated under `` the rule of reason , '' whereby `` all pertinent evidence is examined in order to determine whether the inventor 's story is credible . '' Sandt Tech. , Ltd. v. Resco Metal & Plastics Corp. , 264 F.3d 1344 , 1350 ( Fed.Cir.2001 ) ( citations and internal quotation marks omitted ) ; see also Medichem , S.A. v. Rolabo , S.L. , 437 F.3d 1157 , 1171 ( Fed.Cir.2006 ) ( `` corroboration is fundamentally about 'credibility ' `` ) . Importantly , `` [ t ] he law does not impose an impossible standard of independence on corroborative evidence by requiring that every point of a reduction to practice be corroborated by evidence having a source totally independent of the inventor ; indeed , such a standard is the antithesis of the rule of reason . '' Cooper v. Goldfarb , 154 F.3d 1321 , 1331 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) ( citation and internal quotation marks omitted ) . We have treated the sufficiency of corroboration as a question of fact , with the district court 's determination subject to review for clear error . Medichem , 437 F.3d at 1171-72 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Here , Orr 's testimony of prior invention was sufficiently corroborated by the documentary evidence . The record contains 1992 data from GPS experiments that Orr ran at the time , e.g. , J.A . 7757 ( frequency plot entitled `` Ka band in False Region Record '' ) , and 1996 notes and correspondence from Orr pertaining to GPS and , more specifically , to `` realizing product features identified in ... [ a ] brainstorming meeting ... [ by ] integrat [ ing ] a radar detector into ... automotive navigation systems , '' J.A . 7352-53 . Most tellingly , perhaps , the record contains a 1996 letter from Greg Blair , Vice President of Cincinnati Microwave , addressed to Orr and other employees , which refers to `` entering the ETAK [ a type of automotive navigation system ] business ... to get speed and position to silence a detector '' and to `` patent [ ing ] the concept of ... vehicle position muting and then working with the ETAK folks for a data link to our detectors , '' J.A . 7354 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This evidence makes credible Orr 's general account : in 1988 , when he had his specific conception , various industry participants were thinking generally about equipping radar detectors with GPS to reduce false alarms ; Cincinnati Microwave , in particular , was interested in the idea ; by 1992 , Orr was collecting data and working toward reducing the conception to practice ; and in 1996 , spurred by great interest in his project , Orr reduced his invention to practice . The evidence , in referring to frequencies and to using a GPS-given location to mute a detector alarm , also provides substantial corroboration of the more specific claim limitations concerning lockout frequencies and distances that Fleming has highlighted in his argument . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Fleming is correct that none of the corroborating evidence constitutes definitive proof of Orr 's account or discloses each claim limitation as written . But the corroboration requirement has never been so demanding . See Cooper , 154 F.3d at 1331 . It is a flexible , rule-of-reason demand for independent evidence that , as a whole , makes credible the testimony of the purported prior inventor with regard to conception and reduction to practice of the invention as claimed . Sandt , 264 F.3d at 1350-51 . The evidence presented here sufficiently does that . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 3 _NEWLINE_ Fleming 's final challenge is that , even if Orr had priority of invention by virtue of his activities through 1996 , he lost priority *1378 under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 102 ( g ) ( 2 ) 's disqualification of prior inventions that have been `` abandoned , suppressed , or concealed . '' Although we accept the facts as found by the jury where ( as here ) they are supported by substantial evidence , we have said that `` [ s ] uppression or concealment is a question of law which we review de novo . '' Fujikawa v. Wattanasin , 93 F.3d 1559 , 1567 ( Fed.Cir.1996 ) . We reject Fleming 's challenge . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Abandonment , suppression , or concealment may be shown by proof of the prior inventor 's active efforts to do so or `` may be inferred based upon the prior inventor 's unreasonable delay in making the invention publicly known . '' Dow Chem . Co. v. Astro-Valcour , Inc. , 267 F.3d 1334 , 1342 ( Fed.Cir.2001 ) ; see also Fox Grp. , Inc. v. Cree , Inc. , 700 F.3d 1300 , 1305-06 ( Fed.Cir.2012 ) . Whether a delay is sufficiently reasonable to avoid the inference `` has consistently been based on equitable principles and public policy as applied to the facts of each case . '' Checkpoint Sys. , Inc. v. U.S. Int ' l Trade Comm ' n , 54 F.3d 756 , 761 ( Fed.Cir.1995 ) ( citation and internal quotation marks omitted ) . For example , `` delay between the first reduction to practice and public disclosure '' is excused `` if the inventor continued to refine , perfect , or improve the invention . '' Eolas Techs . Inc. v. Microsoft Corp. , 399 F.3d 1325 , 1333 ( Fed.Cir.2005 ) . Moreover , even `` a long period of inactivity need not be a fatal forfeiture , if the first inventor resumes work on the invention before the second inventor enters the field . '' Paulik v. Rizkalla , 760 F.2d 1270 , 1272 ( Fed.Cir.1985 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In this case , there is no evidence of any active efforts to suppress or conceal . And we find the timing of Orr 's activities leading to his June 1999 patent application not to warrant an inference of abandonment , suppression , or concealment . The evidence is sufficient to establish the following facts , covering three periods starting from the April 1996 reduction to practice . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In the first period , before the February 1997 date of Cincinnati Microwave 's bankruptcy , Cincinnati Microwave had great interest in the project , J.A . 6094 , and Orr studied , refined , and improved his invention : he studied `` selective availability , '' i.e. , signal interference by the military that impaired the use of his invention , J.A . 6095 , and conducted field testing and wrote additional code to perfect his invention , J.A . 6104-22 . In the third period , after Orr started working at Escort in the summer of 1998 , he was immediately put to work on his invention , and he continued this work at least until he filed for his own patent in June 1999 . E.g. , J.A . 6293 ( Escort 's Kuhn testifying that Escort was motivated to hire Orr because of Orr 's expertise in radar/GPS , and that Kuhn told Orr to work on his invention once he joined Escort ) , J.A . 7494-546 ( Orr 's timesheets at Escort from July 1998 to July 1999 , mentioning work on radar/GPS work , including `` Ka falsing improvements '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ What happened in the middle period-between February 1997 and summer 1998-is this : For a period of `` approximately 13 months after the bankruptcy , '' Orr joined another firm to work with `` a group of engineers that were designing a cordless telephone . '' J.A . 6123 . The patent rights to Orr 's radar/GPS prior invention , created at Cincinnati Microwave , were acquired by Escort in the bankruptcy , and Escort set priorities to get its new business going but , even so , was interested in developing this invention . Orr testified that , from the middle of 1997 to the middle of 1998 , while working elsewhere , he was giving Escort information about his invention , J.A . 6182 , and that Escort was pursuing Orr 's invention and conferring with *1379 Orr about it during that period , J.A . 6184 . Escort 's Kuhn testified that , from the start , Escort was motivated to hire Orr because of Orr 's expertise in radar/GPS , was seeking to hire him during its startup period , and finally did hire Orr , in July 1998 , to adapt his invention to `` a new detection scheme '' to resolve performance issues . J.A . 6287-93 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In these circumstances , we do not infer suppression , concealment , or abandonment for two reasons . First : In making his argument in this court and in the district court , Fleming 's position has been that his priority date is April 14 , 1999 , when he filed his patent application . That date is later than the dates of Orr 's conception ( 1988 ) and reduction to practice ( 1996 ) -not in dispute for purposes of the present issue . It also is later than the latest possible date-summer 1998-that the evidence establishes Orr resumed work on his prior invention when joining Escort . Even if the focus were solely on Orr ( thus disregarding Escort , the patent-rights owner ) , and even if Orr had abandoned his invention before summer 1998 , the defense of abandonment is properly rejected on the ground that Orr resumed his active work before Fleming 's April 1999 priority date . See Paulik , 760 F.2d at 1272 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Second : Although Fleming has not made an argument based on a pre-1999 priority date , the conclusion would not change even if we assumed a May 1998 conception date for Fleming ( for which there is evidence ) . On that assumption , the crucial period for the abandonment analysis would be the time between Cincinnati Micro-wave 's February 1997 bankruptcy and Orr 's July 1998 employment at Escort . But what occurred during that period does not warrant an inference of suppression , concealment , or abandonment . At most , there was a reasonable pause in active work : the rights to the invention were transferred from one owner to a new owner during a period of bankruptcy ; the new owner concentrated its initial efforts on products ready for immediate sale ; and even during that period , the new owner maintained communication with Orr and made efforts to bring him to the firm precisely to resume the work needed to perfect the prior invention . The delay of active work in these circumstances was not unreasonable and was consistent with a continuing commitment to pursuing the project to the full extent conditions allowed . In brief , the concepts of abandonment , suppression , and concealment do not fit the facts as reasonably found by the jury . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B _NEWLINE_ Escort , in its cross-appeal , argues that Fleming 's reissue patents are invalid because there was no `` error '' in the original patent , a prerequisite to obtaining a reissue patent . `` Determining whether an applicant has met the statutory requirements of 35 U.S.C . ¡± 251 is a question of law , which we review de novo . '' In re Clement , 131 F.3d 1464 , 1468 ( Fed.Cir.1997 ) . We reject Escort 's contention . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The version of section 251 applicable here reads : _NEWLINE_ Whenever any patent is , through error without any deceptive intention , deemed wholly or partly inoperative or invalid , by reason of a defective specification or drawing , or by reason of the patentee claiming more or less than he had a right to claim in the patent , the Director shall , on the surrender of such patent and the payment of the fee required by law , reissue the patent for the invention disclosed in the original patent , and in accordance with a new and amended *1380 application , for the unexpired part of the term of the original patent . _NEWLINE_ 35 U.S.C . ¡± 251 ( 2006 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Escort invokes the requirement that there have been an `` error '' in the original patent . Errors are not limited to slips of the pen but encompass-and most often are-deliberate drafting choices . See In re Dinsmore , 757 F.3d 1343 , 1347-48 ( Fed.Cir.2014 ) . Not all choices qualify , though : `` it is important whether deficient understandings , by the applicants or their agents , gave rise to the patenting choice that reissue is being invoked to correct . '' Id . at 1348 . A drafting choice that rested on `` no cognizable false or deficient understanding of fact or law , '' but that was , say , an eyes-open choice made to secure the patent , `` is not 'error ' as required by section 251 . '' Id . at 1347 . That kind of choice is nothing but a `` now-regretted choice , '' which is not error . Id . But this case does not fall into that category . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The asserted error here is that , when drafting his original patent , Fleming failed to appreciate the full scope of his invention and the inadequacy of the original claims for properly capturing the full scope . This is a classic reason that qualifies as error . Id . at 1348 . It identifies a deficient understanding of some combination of fact and law bearing on the meaning of claim language , the inventions disclosed in the written description , and how particular language does or does not map onto products or processes that could be claimed under section 251 consistent with the written description . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Escort suggests otherwise by noting Fleming 's explanation that he wrote his original patent from the perspective of a `` programmer . '' J.A . 5947 , 5980 . That fact , however , in no way undermines the premise of a mistaken understanding of the scope of the written description and/or claims-it actually helps explain the origin of the error . Likewise , the fact that it was marketplace developments that prompted Fleming to reassess his issued claims and to see their deficiencies , J.A . 5926-27 , 5945 , does not alter the qualifying character of the reason for reissue . Erroneous understandings of the written description or claims are just that , regardless of what triggered the recognition of error in those understandings . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Any reissue patent , of course , must meet all of section 251 's requirements . But the only challenge presented by Escort is the lack of `` error . '' That challenge is meritless . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ CONCLUSION _NEWLINE_ For the foregoing reasons , we affirm the district court 's judgment upholding the jury 's verdict . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ AFFIRMED _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 774 F.3d 1371 , 113 U.S.P.Q.2d 1426 _NEWLINE_ Footnotes _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This case is governed by the statutory provisions in effect before the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act ( AIA ) , Pub.L .

Alleged infringers moved for judgment notwithstanding verdict in favor of patentee , or in alternative for new trial . The United States District Court for the District of Delaware , Joseph J.

The Court of Appeals , Plager , Circuit Judge , held that : ( 1 ) specific activity limitation appearing in claims for one patent meant specific activity as measured by using bovine fibrin plate assay ; ( 2 ) considering prosecution history , specific activity of alleged infringing product did not as matter of law meet specific activity limitation appearing in claim , under doctrine of equivalents ; and ( 3 ) human tissue plasminogen activator limitation appearing in two of the patents meant natural protein found only in patented product , and jury 's implied conclusion that alleged infringing product met activator limitation appearing in patents under doctrine of equivalents was not supported by substantial evidence . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Reversed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Lourie , Circuit Judge , concurred and filed opinion . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Attorneys and Law Firms _NEWLINE_ *1557 Stephen F.

The United States District Court for the District of Delaware found in favor of the patent owners/licensees ( and their agent ) , plaintiffs Genentech , Inc. ( Genentech ) , Innovi N.V. ( Innovi ) , and Leuven Research & Development VZW ( Leuven ) , holding that the Genetics defendants , to wit , Genetics Institute , Inc. ( Institute ) and Genetics Manufacturing , Inc. ( GI Manufacturing ) , infringed under the doctrine of equivalents U.S. Patent Nos . 4,752,603 ( the '603 patent ) , 4,766,075 ( the '075 patent ) , and 4,853,330 ( the '330 patent ) . That judgment was entered by the court on April 6 , 1990 in consolidated Civil Action Nos . 88-330 and 89-407 following a jury trial , and became final on July 15 , 1992 when the court denied defendants ' motions for judgment as a matter of law ( JMOL ) 1 or , in the alternative , a new trial . Genentech Inc. v. Wellcome Foundation Ltd. , 798 F.Supp . 213 , 24 USPQ2d 1782 ( D.Del.1992 ) . The Genetics defendants appeal . We find that the judgment of the trial court is not sustainable under the law , and reverse . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ BACKGROUND _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 . _NEWLINE_ The protein tissue plasminogen activator ( t-PA ) plays an important role in the dissolution of fibrin clots in the human body . The body forms such clots typically to breach a rupture in a blood vessel . When they are no longer needed , they are dissolved through the action of plasmin , an enzyme which binds to the fibrin and severs the bonds between the fibrin molecules . Since plasmin circulates through the blood in an inactive form called plasminogen , a mechanism must be provided to activate the plasminogen and convert it to plasmin when a clot is targeted for dissolution by the body . The protein t-PA serves as that mechanism . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Unfortunately , a pathological clot known as a 'thrombus ' sometimes forms in intact vessels and causes life-threatening conditions . When a thrombus occurs , the normal amount of t-PA circulating in the body may not be effective to produce plasmin fast enough to dissolve the clot , and avoid the risk of heart muscle damage or death . An additional dosage of a material which activates the plasminogen is often necessary to dissolve the clot rapidly . Several materials , such as natural t-PA extracted from human cells , streptokinase , or urokinase , were known to perform *1558 this function , although imperfectly , either because , in the case of streptokinase and urokinase , of undesirable side effects and low affinity to fibrin , and in the case of natural t-PA , the inability to derive clinically effective volumes from known sources . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Plaintiff Leuven then set to work to find a way to produce natural t-PA in a commercially useful way , i.e. , in sufficient quantities and at a sufficient level of purity and effectiveness to meet commercial demands . This task was assigned to three of Leuven 's scientists-Drs . Collen , Rijken , and Matsuo . They discovered that a commercially useful quantity and purity of natural t-PA could be produced from human melanoma cell cultures . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This discovery is the subject of the '603 patent , the sole independent claim of which reads : _NEWLINE_ 1 . Human plasminogen activator , having thrombolytic properties , immunologically distinct from urokinase and having a specific activity of about 500,000 IU/mg . using the WHO First International Reference Preparation of t-PA ( tissue plasminogen activator ) as assay standard or a specific activity of about 90,000 IU/mg . using the WHO First International Reference Preparation of urokinase as assay standard . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Meanwhile , plaintiff Genentech set about pursuing the same objective , a commercially useful process for producing natural t-PA , but by a different route-recombinant DNA technology.2 That task was assigned to four Genentech scientists-Drs . Goeddel , Kohr , Vehar , and Pennica . They ultimately discovered such a process as well as the intermediate products used in the process , i.e. , the DNA sequence encoding human t-PA , the expression vector containing that sequence , and the microorganism or cell culture capable of expressing human t-PA using that vector . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The intermediate products are the subject of the claims of the '075 patent , of which claims 1 , 3 , and 8 are representative : _NEWLINE_ 1 . A DNA isolate consisting essentially of a DNA sequence encoding human tissue plasminogen activator . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ * * * * * * _NEWLINE_ 3 . A recombinant expression vector containing a DNA sequence encoding human tissue plasminogen activator , wherein the vector is capable of expressing human tissue plasminogen activator in a transformed microorganism or cell culture . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ * * * * * * _NEWLINE_ 8 . A cell culture capable of expressing human tissue plasminogen activator , obtained by transforming a mammalian cell line with a vector according to claim 3 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The process itself is the subject of the claims of the '330 patent , of which claims 1 , 8 , and 12 are representative : _NEWLINE_ 1 . A process which comprises expressing a DNA sequence encoding human tissue plasminogen activator in a recombinant host cell , said recombinant host cell being a microorganism or cell culture transformed with an expression vector containing said DNA sequence . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ * * * * * * _NEWLINE_ 8 . A process for producing recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator comprising : _NEWLINE_ ( a ) growing recombinant cells in a growth medium , said cells being a microorganism or cell culture transformed with an expression vector containing DNA encoding human tissue plasminogen activator ; and _NEWLINE_ ( b ) simultaneously expressing said DNA , thereby producing recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ * * * * * * _NEWLINE_ 12 . A process for producing recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator comprising : _NEWLINE_ ( a ) transforming a microorganism or cell culture with a replicable vector containing DNA encoding human tissue plasminogen activator ; and _NEWLINE_ *1559 ( b ) expressing said DNA in said transformed microorganism or cell culture . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 2 . _NEWLINE_ The plaintiffs in this action consist of Leuven , the owner of the '603 patent ; Genentech , the owner of the '075 and '330 patents , and the exclusive licensee of the '603 patent ; and Innovi , Leuven 's agent to assist it in licensing its technology rights . They initiated this action on June 21 , 1988 , the day the '603 patent issued , alleging infringement of the '603 patent , and subsequently amended their complaint after the '075 patent issued on August 23 , 1988 to allege infringement of that patent . When the '330 patent issued on August 1 , 1989 , plaintiffs initiated a separate action against defendants alleging infringement of that patent ; that action was subsequently consolidated with the other . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The original defendants consisted of the Genetics defendants-Institute and GI Manufacturing-as well as the Wellcome defendants-The Wellcome Foundation Ltd. ( Foundation ) ; Wellcome Biotechnology Ltd. ( Biotechnology ) ; Burroughs Wellcome Co. ( Burroughs ) ; BW Manufacturing , Inc. ( BW Manufacturing ) ; and WelGen Manufacturing , Inc. ( WelGen ) .3 GI Manufacturing is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Institute . BW Manufacturing is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Burroughs , which in turn is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Foundation . GI Manufacturing and BW Manufacturing jointly own WelGen . That entity was , at the time this action was initiated , admittedly constructing a facility in the United States for the commercial production of t-PA. _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ According to plaintiffs ' allegations , the Genetics and Wellcome defendants acted in concert to make , use , and import into the United States natural t-PA , or variants of natural t-PA , produced through recombinant DNA technology that infringe the patents-in-suit . There are two accused products-met-t-PA and FE1X-both of which are structurally distinct from natural t-PA.4 The Genetics defendants are alleged to have manufactured in the United States the FE1X product for commercial purposes . The Wellcome defendants are alleged to have manufactured in the United Kingdom the met-t-PA product , and imported that product into the United States for commercial purposes . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In response to plaintiffs ' allegations , defendants denied infringement and asserted the affirmative defenses that the three patents-in-suit were invalid , and unenforceable due to inequitable and fraudulent conduct during prosecution . Defendants also asserted counterclaims alleging that plaintiffs ' procurement and enforcement of the three patents-in-suit against them constituted an antitrust violation and unfair competition . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The parties then filed cross-motions for summary judgment on the infringement question in relation to the '603 and '075 patents . The '330 patent was not the subject of those motions . Shortly before trial was to commence , on March 8 , 1990 , the court granted defendants ' motions in part . Specifically , it found that the accused products did not literally infringe the '603 and '075 patents , but it reserved the doctrine of equivalents issue for trial . Genentech Inc. v. The Wellcome Foundation Ltd. , 14 USPQ2d 1363 , 1990 WL 69187 ( D.Del.1990 ) . In concluding that defendants ' products did not literally infringe the '603 and '075 patents , the court focused on the `` human plasminogen activator '' limitation recited in the '603 claims *1560 and the `` human tissue plasminogen activator '' limitation appearing in the '075 claims . It interpreted these phrases to mean the full length amino acid sequence of human t-PA plus any `` naturally-occurring allelic variant '' thereof . Id . at 1369 . Since neither of the accused products contains the full length sequence of natural t-PA or any naturally-occurring variant thereof , the court concluded they did not literally meet that limitation . Id . at 1369-70 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The court also focussed on the `` specific activity of about 500,000 IU/mg . '' limitation recited in the '603 claims . Although that limitation is not expressly recited in the '075 claims , the court found it was implicit in those claims . Id . at 1368 . Based on representations made to the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( PTO ) during the '603 prosecution , the court interpreted that phrase to mean something `` significantly above '' a specific activity of about 266,000 IU/mg. , to distinguish the '603 claims from prior work of one of the '603 inventors , Dr. Rijken , in which natural t-PA with a specific activity of 266,000 IU/mg . had been isolated . Id . at 1368 . It found that that limitation was likewise not literally met by either of the accused products , FE1X , because of plaintiff 's failure to prove the specific activity level of that product , and met-t-PA , because the proven specific activity level was not `` about 500,000 IU/mg. '' . Id . at 1369-70 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Subsequently , on March 15 , 1990 , the court commenced a jury trial on the doctrine of equivalents issue . After 15 days of testimony , the trial court instructed the jury . Although the court issued general instructions on the issues of claim construction , the doctrine of equivalents , and prosecution history estoppel , the court refused defendants ' request that the court instruct the jury on the construction and interpretation of the claims it had previously utilized in resolving the literal infringement issue . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ After deliberating for two hours and forty-eight minutes , the jury returned special verdicts finding that ( 1 ) the accused product manufactured by the Wellcome defendants-met-t-PA-infringed under the doctrine of equivalents the '603 and '330 patents ; ( 2 ) the accused product manufactured by the Genetics defendants-FE1X-infringed under the doctrine of equivalents the '603 , '075 , and '330 patents ; 5 and ( 3 ) all three patents were not proved invalid or unenforceable . In addition , the jury determined that defendants had not shown plaintiffs committed antitrust violations or unfair competition . On April 6 , 1990 , the court entered judgment in accordance with the jury 's special verdicts . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On April 20 , 1990 , defendants filed their motions for JMOL or , in the alternative , for a new trial . Some two years later , in the decision that gave rise to this appeal , the trial court denied those motions . The Genetics defendants then filed this appeal . One of the Wellcome defendants-WelGen , the joint venture-also appealed ; however , on October 22 , 1992 , it dismissed its appeal with prejudice . None of the other Wellcome defendants appealed . While this appeal was pending , the Wellcome defendants announced their intention to discontinue development of a t-PA product . Thus the issue of infringement by met-t-PA is not involved in this appeal . Nor did plaintiffs/appellees cross-appeal the partial summary judgment against them on the literal infringement question . The only issues now on appeal then are whether FE1X infringes one or more of the '603 , '075 , or '330 patents under the doctrine of equivalents . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ DISCUSSION _NEWLINE_ The Genetics defendants state three separate grounds upon which they assert that the judgment of the trial court should be reversed . First , there was a lack of substantial evidence showing that FE1X met under the doctrine of equivalents the specific activity limitation expressly recited in the '603 claims and implicit in the claims of the other two patents-in-suit . Second , there was a failure to provide particularized testimony sufficient to support the equivalence finding in relation to the `` human tissue plasminogen activator '' limitation recited in the '075 and '330 claims *1561 as required by Malta v. Schulmerich Carillons , Inc. , 952 F.2d 1320 , 21 USPQ2d 1161 ( Fed.Cir.1991 ) , cert . denied , 504 U.S. 974 , 112 S.Ct . 2942 , 119 L.Ed.2d 566 ( 1992 ) . Third , there was a complete absence of proof of any involvement by GI Manufacturing in infringing activity . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In the alternative , the Genetics defendants state four separate grounds upon which they assert they are entitled to a new trial . First , the jury was not provided sufficient guidance-including an instruction informing it of the construction and interpretation of the '603 and '075 claims the court had adopted in resolving on summary judgment the literal infringement question in relation to those patents-with which to fairly resolve the doctrine of equivalents issue . Second , the jury was not advised of the adverse consequences to defendants of a finding of infringement . Third , relevant portions of the prosecution histories of the patents-in-suit-relating to the treatment received in the British courts by the British counterparts of the patents-in-suit-were improperly excluded . Fourth , the verdict is against the great weight of the evidence and would stifle research and development in the field of biotechnology . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Before addressing these points , it is necessary to resolve three threshold issues of claim construction or interpretation.6 First , whether , as the Genetics defendants assert , the specific activity limitation appearing in the '603 claims is implicit in the '075 and '330 claims . Second , whether , as the Genetics defendants further assert , the 500,000 figure appearing as part of that limitation means 500,000 IU/mg . as measured using the bovine fibrin plate assay . Third , what is the literal meaning of the phrase `` human tissue plasminogen activator '' appearing in the '075 and '330 claims . These issues are issues of law-they are classic issues of claim construction , that is , what do the claims mean . See North American Vaccine v. American Cyanamid Co. , 7 F.3d 1571 , 1575 , 28 USPQ2d 1333 , 1336 ( Fed.Cir.1993 ) , cert . denied , 511 U.S. 1069 , 114 S.Ct . 1645 , 128 L.Ed.2d 365 ( 1994 ) ; Johnston v. IVAC Corp. , 885 F.2d 1574 , 1579-80 , 12 USPQ2d 1382 , 1385-86 ( Fed.Cir.1989 ) . They are for the court to decide and explicate on the record . See Read Corp. v. Portec Inc. , 970 F.2d 816 , 822 , 23 USPQ2d 1426 , 1432 ( Fed.Cir.1992 ) . Since the trial court did not instruct the jury on these issues , and did not appear to have utilized its prior claim interpretation in ruling on the motions for JMOL , it is necessary for us to resolve these issues now in ruling on the court 's denial of Genetics ' motions for JMOL . Id . at 822-23 , 23 USPQ2d at 1432 . We address each of these threshold points in order . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 3 . Claim Construction _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ a . The specific activity limitation _NEWLINE_ We begin with the question of whether , as the Genetics defendants assert , the specific activity limitation appearing in the '603 claims is implicit in the '075 and '330 claims . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Genetics defendants first assert that plaintiffs/appellees are precluded from arguing that the limitation is not implicit in those claims due to plaintiffs ' failure to appeal the district court 's grant of summary judgment ( by filing a cross-appeal to the present appeal ) . As noted previously , in that decision , the trial court determined that the limitation was implicit in the '075 claims . Thus , according to the Genetics defendants , that determination is `` law of the case . `` 7 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1562 We disagree . `` The general rule is that , without taking a cross-appeal , the prevailing party may present any argument that supports the judgment in its favor . '' Radio Steel & Mfg . Co. v. MTD Products , Inc. , 731 F.2d 840 , 843 , 221 USPQ 657 , 660 ( Fed.Cir . ) , cert . denied , 469 U.S. 831 , 105 S.Ct . 119 , 83 L.Ed.2d 62 ( 1984 ) ; see 9 James W. Moore , Moore 's Federal Practice , ? 204.11 [ 3 ] , at 4-47 ( 2d ed . 1993 ) . Here , were we to adopt a claim construction more favorable to plaintiffs ' case than the construction adopted by the district court on summary judgment , that would have no different result than affirmance of the trial court 's April 6 , 1990 judgment . Accordingly , plaintiffs are not precluded from arguing a construction in support of the judgment that is different from that announced by the trial court . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In any event , the Genetics defendants argue , the specific activity limitation appearing in the '603 claims is inherent in the phrase `` human tissue plasminogen activator '' appearing in the '075 and '330 claims . Again , we disagree . Assuming for the sake of argument that the phrase `` human tissue plasminogen activator '' is ambiguous , there is no basis in the '330 and '075 specifications and prosecution histories for reading a specific activity limitation into the phrase . The only evidence identified by the Genetics defendants as a plausible basis for doing so is the '603 specification and prosecution history . However , that patent is completely unrelated to the '330 and '075 patents . It was prosecuted by a different entity than the others . The underlying research was conducted by different individuals than the research underlying the others . And finally , while the specific activity concept is a definition of purity critical to the patentability of the '603 claims-it is the critical distinction of those claims over the less purified materials constituting the relevant prior art8-the same can not be said of the '330 and '075 claims , in which other limitations serve to distinguish the claimed subject matter over the prior art . Thus , that documentation can not serve as the basis for reading the limitation into the phrase . We conclude that the '330 and '075 patents contain no implied specific activity limitation . The avoidance of this limitation by FE1X thus can not provide the basis for a finding of non-infringement under the doctrine of equivalents in relation to these patents . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ b . The meaning of `` 500,000 IU/mg . '' _NEWLINE_ The next question to resolve is the meaning of the numerical figure `` 500,000 IU/mg . '' appearing as part of the specific activity limitation of the '603 claims . The Genetics defendants argue that the figure means 500,000 IU/mg . as measured using a bovine fibrin plate assay . The plaintiffs , by contrast , argue that the figure is not limited to any specific assay type . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We agree with the Genetics defendants . According to the prior art of record , the numerical measurement of specific activity of t-PA can vary by more than a factor of three depending on the specific assay used.9 Thus , in order for the 500,000 figure to serve its intended purpose of distinguishing over the prior art value of 266,000 IU/mg. , it is necessary to assign that figure a specific assay type . Since the claim is silent on this point10 , we must look elsewhere for the answer . See Hormone Research Found . v. Genentech , Inc. , 904 F.2d 1558 , 1562 , 15 USPQ2d 1039 , 1043 ( Fed.Cir.1990 ) , cert . dismissed , 499 U.S. 955 , 111 S.Ct . 1434 , 113 L.Ed.2d 485 ( 1991 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The '603 prosecution history reveals that the 500,000 figure was added to the '603 claims during prosecution to distinguish over prior work of Dr. Rijken 's . That work had resulted in a specific activity of 48,000 IU/mg. , when expressed in terms of the prevailing urokinase standard , and 266,000 IU/mg. , when expressed in terms of the new and *1563 preferred t-PA standard that had evolved after the '603 filing date.11 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The specific activity of the claimed product was initially only available in terms of the urokinase standard . When so expressed , the figure was 90,000 IU/mg . Dr. Collen was assigned the task of expressing the figure in terms of the new standard . That work resulted in the 500,000 figure . An article contained in the '603 prosecution history shows that this figure was determined using `` bovine fibrin films '' , i.e. , a bovine fibrin plate assay.12 Apparently , that assay was used so that the figure would be compatible with Dr. Rijken 's prior work , in which specific activity was measured using the bovine fibrin plate assay13 , and with the work which gave rise to the filing of the '603 patent , in which specific activity was likewise measured using the bovine fibrin plate assay . Col. 5 , ll . 1-6 . Accordingly , we conclude that the 500,000 figure means IU/mg . as measured using the bovine fibrin plate assay . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ c. The definition of `` human tissue plasminogen activator '' _NEWLINE_ We next address the question of the meaning of the phrase `` human tissue plasminogen activator '' appearing in the '075 and '330 claims . Since a definition of that phrase can not be extracted from the claims themselves , we look to the specification14 for guidance . See McGill Inc. v. John Zink Co. , 736 F.2d 666 , 674 , 221 USPQ 944 , 949 ( Fed.Cir.1984 ) , cert . denied , 469 U.S. 1037 , 105 S.Ct . 514 , 83 L.Ed.2d 404 ( 1984 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A problem now arises because there are at least four possible definitions of the phrase set forth in the specification.15 First , there is a narrow structural definition : t-PA produced through recombinant DNA technology but having the same structure as natural t-PA.16 Second , there is a broader structural definition : all products containing the `` essential '' 17 Kringle region , and the Serine Protease region.18 Third , there is an even *1564 broader structural definition : all products containing just the enzymatically active portion , i.e. , the Serine Protease portion.19 Fourth , there is a functional definition : `` [ I ] t is capable of catalyzing the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin , binds to fibrin , and is classified as a t-PA based on immunological properties as set forth hereinabove . '' Col. 6 , ll . 15-19 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ These diverse definitions reflect either inartful drafting , a conscious attempt to create ambiguity about the scope of the claims , or a desire to claim a wide variety of materials not described or enabled in the specification . For example , it appears that some of the products contained within the third definition will not be capable of binding to fibrin because they lack the regions which have been identified as playing a role in the fibrin binding process.20 Yet , the fourth definition identifies fibrin binding as an essential functional attribute of human t-PA. _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ An appropriate method for resolving the issue is to avoid those definitions upon which the PTO could not reasonably have relied when it issued the patent . That is an appropriate method to follow because it avoids the possibility of an applicant obtaining in court a scope of protection which encompasses subject matter that , through the conscious efforts of the applicant , the PTO did not examine.21 An applicant should not be able deliberately to narrow the scope of examination to avoid during prosecution scrutiny by the PTO of subject matter with the objective of more quickly obtaining a patent ( or avoiding the risk of an estoppel ) , and then obtain in court , either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents , a scope of protection which encompasses that subject matter . See North American Vaccine Inc. , 7 F.3d at 1577 , 28 USPQ2d at 1337 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Under this approach , the first definition is the appropriate one to adopt because of the four , it is the most consistent with the limited form in which the claims are drafted22 , and the others are hopelessly overbroad . As Dr. Goeddel testified , an infinite number of permutations of natural t-PA are covered by these other definitions . Many of these permutations would not be capable of binding to fibrin and would thus be inoperative . There is no basis provided in the specification for determining which of these permutations are operative and which are not . The point is supported by Dr. Larsen 's testimony to the effect that the properties of these permutations were `` totally unpredictable . '' Genentech acknowledged this point in two international patent applications it filed directed to the structural features which define FE1X in relation to natural t-PA.23 The determination of which permutations are operative would thus require an undue amount of experimentation.24 Thus , we are unwilling to *1565 say that the specification satisfies the enablement requirement of 35 U.S.C . ¡± 112 ? 1 ( 1988 ) with respect to these broader definitions25 , or that the PTO could have relied on these definitions in issuing the patent . See In re Fisher , 427 F.2d 833 , 838-40 , 166 USPQ 18 , 23-24 ( CCPA 1970 ) ; see also Amgen Inc. v. Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. , 927 F.2d 1200 , 1212-14 , 18 USPQ2d 1016 , 1026-28 ( Fed.Cir . ) , cert . denied sub nom. , Genetics Inst. , Inc. v. Amgen , Inc. , 502 U.S. 856 , 112 S.Ct . 169 , 116 L.Ed.2d 132 ( 1991 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Plaintiffs argue that a protein ( 25E10 ) discussed in the specification provides a basis for interpreting the phrase `` human tissue plasminogen activator '' appearing in the claims broadly , on the theory that claims are to be interpreted in light of the disclosure of examples in the specification . See SmithKline Diagnostics Inc. v. Helena Laboratories Corp. , 859 F.2d 878 , 8 USPQ2d 1468 ( Fed.Cir.1988 ) . The difficulty with that argument is that 25E10 is not natural t-PA , and its disclosure therefore does not aid in interpreting the claims.26 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We conclude therefore that the phrase `` human tissue plasminogen activator '' appearing in the '075 and '330 claims means natural t-PA.27 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 4 . The Jury Findings Regarding the Specific Activity Limitation _NEWLINE_ Having completed our resolution of the three threshold claim interpretation questions , we consider in order the points raised by the Genetics defendants keeping in mind our standard of review : whether the jury 's express or implied findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence . See Read , 970 F.2d at 821 , 23 USPQ2d at 1431 . We begin with the question of whether the jury 's implied conclusion-that the specific activity limitation appearing in the '603 claims was met by FE1X either literally or equivalently-is supported by substantial evidence.28 We conclude that it is not . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As we have said , `` substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla . It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion . '' Biodex Corp. v. Loredan Biomedical Inc. , 946 F.2d 850 , 859 , 20 USPQ2d 1252 , 1259 ( Fed.Cir.1991 ) , cert . denied , 504 U.S. 980 , 112 S.Ct . 2957 , 119 L.Ed.2d 579 ( 1992 ) ( quoting Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB , 305 U.S. 197 , 229 , 59 S.Ct . 206 , 216 , 83 L.Ed . 126 ( 1938 ) ) . Plaintiffs point to the following three pieces of evidence : ( 1 ) Dr. Larsen 's testimony that the specific activity of FE1X is in the range from 350,000 to 450,000 IU/mg. , ( 2 ) statements in an internal Institute document to the effect that the specific activity of FE1X is `` similar '' to that of natural t-PA29 , and ( 3 ) a publication co-authored by Dr. Collen stating that *1566 the specific activity of FE1X is 440,000 IU/mg.30 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ To begin with , the specific activity measurements reported by Dr. Larsen were made using the chromogenic substrate assay , and there is no evidence that measurements made using this assay are comparable to those made using the bovine fibrin plate assay . In fact , all the evidence of record addressing this subject indicates that the two methods are not comparable . Dr. Larsen 's testimony on this point is representative : _NEWLINE_ A Excuse me , I believe [ the chromogenic assay measurements ] requires a clarification . You 're really talking about two totally different assays . _NEWLINE_ Q I understand that . _NEWLINE_ A So it 's apples and oranges . You can not compare the two numbers ... . _NEWLINE_ Q I understand . And at your deposition when you were asked about the specific activity for FE1X was measured against the international t-PA , you said it ranged from 350,000 to 450,000 IU 's per milligram ? _NEWLINE_ A Using a chromogenic substrate assay , and not the fibrin plate assay which appears to be the standard for measuring plasminogen activator activity with respect to these patent disputes . So it is completely distinct from anything that appears to be relevant to me in this trial . _NEWLINE_ Plaintiffs assert that a publication co-authored by Dr. Larsen shows that results obtained using the chromogenic assay are comparable to those obtained using the bovine assay.31 We can not agree . Although that document presents results obtained using the two methods , it hardly establishes that the two methods are comparable . In fact , it implies just the opposite . The two figures reported for FE1X are very different : 334 ¡Ó 45 units/ug . for the chromogenic assay , and 440 units/ug . for the bovine fibrin plate assay . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Likewise , the statements in the internal Institute report do not provide the necessary support . First , they are qualitative whereas the necessary comparison is quantitative . Second , they are based on a synthetic assay which , unlike the bovine fibrin plate assay , does not measure the ability to dissolve clots . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Finally , the 440,000 figure reported in the publication co-authored by Dr. Collen was measured from material prepared by Leuven ; it is not clear what relationship that material bears to the accused product that is the subject of this lawsuit . Dr. Collen 's testimony on this precise point was equivocal . When asked whether this material was the same substance as the accused product , he merely said the `` description '' was the same . Moreover , other measurements reported in that publication and taken in the same manner fall outside the range of permissible scientific error and thus bring into question all the measurements reported.32 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The only evidence in the record which is probative on the question of the specific activity of FE1X is the testimony of plaintiffs ' expert Dr. Mann . According to that testimony , the specific activity of FE1X using the bovine fibrin plate assay is 253,800 IU/mg . plus or minus 18 % , i.e. , 208,116 to 299,484 . That is significantly closer to the prior art value of 266,000 than it is to the claimed range33 , and may even be less than that *1567 value34 . FE1X is thus outside the permissible range of equivalents through the application of prosecution history estoppel.35 No reasonable jury could have concluded otherwise . The trial court thus erred in denying the Genetics defendants ' motions for JMOL in relation to the '603 patent under the doctrine of equivalents . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 5 . The Jury Findings Regarding the Human Tissue Plasminogen Activator Limitation _NEWLINE_ We next consider whether there is evidence in the record sufficient to support the jury 's implied conclusion that the `` human tissue plasminogen activator '' limitation appearing in the '075 and '330 claims is met by FE1X.36 FE1X does not literally meet the limitation-it is not natural t-PA . Thus , the question is whether the evidence supports a finding that this limitation is met by an equivalent element of FE1X under the doctrine of equivalents . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ To support such a finding , the evidence must be sufficiently particularized to meet the three prong test of equivalency enunciated in Graver Tank & Mfg . Co. v. Linde Air Products Co. , 339 U.S. 605 , 608 , 70 S.Ct . 854 , 856 , 94 L.Ed . 1097 , reh ' g denied , 340 U.S. 845 , 71 S.Ct . 12 , 95 L.Ed . 620 ( 1950 ) requiring a showing of substantial identity of function , way , and result . Malta , 952 F.2d at 1327 , 21 USPQ2d at 1166 ; Lear Siegler Inc. v. Sealy Mattress Co. , 873 F.2d 1422 , 1425-26 , 10 USPQ2d 1767 , 1770 ( Fed.Cir.1989 ) . If any one of the prongs is unsupported , the finding of equivalency can not stand . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ At the outset , we are confronted with a problem : The issue of whether the 'way ' or 'result ' prongs are met is highly dependent upon how broadly one defines the `` function '' of human t-PA . If , as the trial court thought , a broad definition is appropriate-stimulating `` the dissolution of fibrin clots through the cleavage of plasminogen to plasmin '' 37-then it is difficult to imagine how FE1X , or any version of t-PA for that matter , would avoid infringement under the doctrine of equivalents because t-PA , or any operative variant , would by definition necessarily perform this function in the same general way with the same general results . However , if the definition of t-PA set forth in the specification is adopted-catalyzing the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin , [ and ] bind [ ing ] to fibrin38-then the equivalence question becomes a much closer one . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The operative definition for purposes of equivalency analysis is the intended function as seen in the context of the patent , the prosecution history , and the prior art . Graver Tank , 339 U.S. at 609 , 70 S.Ct . at 856 ; Zenith Lab . Inc. v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. , 19 F.3d 1418 , 1425 , 30 USPQ2d 1285 , 1291 ( Fed.Cir.1994 ) . Based on our review of these materials , we conclude that no reasonable jury could have adopted the broad definition suggested by the trial court . As noted , the specification expressly defines fibrin binding as a critical component of the `` function '' of human t-PA. Col. 6 , ll . 16-19 . Other evidence confirms this . According to a British patent application filed by Foundation , it is critical in a therapeutic sense-it reduces the risk of hemorrhaging.39 Moreover , as Drs . Goeddel and Collen testified , the fibrin binding affinity of human t-PA is a critical distinction between this protein and the two prior plasminogen activators , urokinase and streptokinase . Thus , a functional definition of t-PA which ignores this distinction *1568 would result in a range of equivalents which impermissably reads on the prior art.40 See Zenith Lab. , 19 F.3d at 1425 , 30 USPQ2d at 1291 n. 9 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We conclude that the `` function '' of human t-PA for purposes of the equivalency analysis includes fibrin binding , and no reasonable jury could have concluded otherwise . In light of this definition , we find that the record is devoid of any particularized evidence or linking argument showing that FE1X functions in substantially the same way as human t-PA or achieves substantially the same results.41 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Plaintiffs point to the testimony of several witnesses to the effect that the Kringle 2 ( K2 ) region of amino acids is present in both FE1X and human t-PA , and that this region plays a role in the ability of both to bind to fibrin . Dr. Larsen testified : _NEWLINE_ Q And FE1X binds the fibrin , does n't it ? _NEWLINE_ A Weakly . _NEWLINE_ Q But it binds the fibrin ? _NEWLINE_ A Weakly . _NEWLINE_ Q Weakly . And it binds the fibrin through the second kringle region , does n't it ? _NEWLINE_ A I do n't know . _NEWLINE_ Q You do n't know how it binds the fibrin ? _NEWLINE_ A I mean that is speculation in the literature , but there are conflicting reports to that point . _NEWLINE_ Q But there are literature reports that suggest that the finger region is involved in the binding to fibrin , as well as the kringle two region ; is n't that correct ? _NEWLINE_ A That is what is generally believed , yes . _NEWLINE_ Q And natural t-PA also binds to fibrin through kringle two , does n't it ? _NEWLINE_ A Assuming that its kringle two , yes . _NEWLINE_ Dr. Wetalufer testified : _NEWLINE_ Q Does GI 's FE1X bind to fibrin ? _NEWLINE_ A GI 's bind to fibrin ? I think it does , but in a weaker way than the full-length material . _NEWLINE_ Q Binds in a weaker way ? _NEWLINE_ A Yes . _NEWLINE_ Q In your view , does it bind to fibrin in a completely different way than the full-length human t-PA ? _NEWLINE_ A No . Clearly there are common elements in the binding of the two t-PA 's . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Dr. Larsen 's testimony is speculative , and Dr. Wetlaufer 's testimony is tentative and conclusory . Even assuming that the K2 region does play a role in the binding function of both , that hardly establishes that the two bind to fibrin in substantially the same way with substantially the same results , particularly in view of the overwhelming and undisputed evidence that the two possess dramatically different properties and structure . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ First , there is the undisputed testimony of Drs . Collen and Larsen that the fibrin binding affinity of FE1X is less than half , i.e. , about 40 % , of that of human t-PA as a consequence of the deletion of the E and F regions in FE1X . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Second , there is undisputed evidence showing that the amino acid substitution at position 117 of the K1 region eliminates a glycosylation site , and thus prevents a carbohydrate side chain from being attached to the protein during post-translational modifications by the host mammalian cell . According to Dr. Larsen , the deletion of the F and E regions standing alone would result in a protein that would be therapeutically ineffective in that it would be incapable of binding to fibrin at all ; preventing the attachment of *1569 the carbohydrate side chain increases the binding affinity of FE1X sufficiently to make it therapeutically effective . Thus , the mode of binding is hardly substantially the same . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Third , there is the undisputed evidence that FE1X behaves significantly differently than human t-PA in the human body . It has a half-life42 about ten times that of natural t-PA and it has a significantly decreased affinity for binding to endothelial cells43 in relation to human t-PA. Genentech acknowledged the significance of these advantages in the two international patent applications noted earlier in this opinion.44 Thus , the results achieved are hardly substantially the same . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We are mindful that the state of the science in this area of endeavor is very imprecise.45 Thus , it would be inappropriate to interpret Malta as requiring plaintiffs/appellees to prove the specific mechanism by which FE1X binds to fibrin , or to prove that the different properties and structure exhibited by FE1X bear no relation to the binding function . Our only point is that the showing that the K2 region plays a role in the binding function of each is insufficient , particularly in view of the profound differences in the properties and structure possessed by each . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ For all the foregoing reasons , we conclude the trial court erred in denying the Genetics defendants ' motion for JMOL in relation to the '075 and '330 patents under the doctrine of equivalents.46 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ SUMMARY _NEWLINE_ The trial judge should have granted JMOL in favor of the Genetics defendants on the doctrine of equivalents findings by the jury because : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 . The specific activity limitation appearing in the '603 claims means specific activity as measured using the bovine fibrin plate assay . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 2 . Considering the '603 prosecution history , the specific activity of FE1X does not as a matter of law meet the specific activity limitation appearing in the '603 claims under the doctrine of equivalents . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 3 . The human tissue plasminogen activator limitation appearing in the '075 and '330 claims means natural t-PA . The jury 's implied conclusion that FE1X meets the human tissue plasminogen activator limitation appearing in the '075 and '330 claims under the doctrine of equivalents is not supported by substantial evidence . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ CONCLUSION _NEWLINE_ For all the foregoing reasons , we reverse.47 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ REVERSED . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1570 LOURIE , Circuit Judge , concurring . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I join the opinion of the majority , but I would adopt a different means to interpret the expression `` human tissue plasminogen activator '' ( t-PA ) . Moreover , I wish to point out an additional reason why I believe that the accused FE1X can not infringe a claim to t-PA under the doctrine of equivalents . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The independent claims at issue in the '075 and '330 recombinant patents contain no definition for the DNA isolate other than that it encodes human t-PA . Such a claim , defining a substance only by its function , encompassing all substances that accomplish that result , is akin to a single means claim , which might fail to satisfy the definiteness requirement of 35 U.S.C . ¡± 112 . See Fiers v. Sugano , 984 F.2d 1164 , 1171 , 25 USPQ2d 1601 , 1606 ( Fed.Cir.1993 ) . Such a claim avoids that problem only when the term `` human tissue plasminogen activator '' has definitive meaning , when it describes a specific compound . That term is in fact definite , as it is well established that human t-PA is a protein consisting of 527 amino acids . Thus , all the claims which depend upon a definition of human t-PA are limited to that specific compound and any other compounds considered under law as equivalent thereto . * The trial court , of course , held that there was no literal infringement . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Under the doctrine of equivalents , an accused compound can be held to infringe if , inter alia , it represents only an insubstantial change from the claimed compound . See Graver Tank & Mfg . Co. v. Linde Air Prods . Co. , 339 U.S. 605 , 607 , 610 , 70 S.Ct . 854 , 855 , 857 , 94 L.Ed . 1097 ( 1950 ) . The accused compound in this case consists of a protein that contains 446 amino acids , 15 % fewer than the t-PA referred to in the claims . This is not an insubstantial change , but a substantial one . Moreover , it has ten times the half-life of natural t-PA . The t-PA recited in the claims was not copied , since the accused FE1X is a very different material , independently invented and developed , requiring an estimated 130 man-years , and costing $ 20 million . If claims are to have any meaning , as a matter of law such a substance can not be held to be infringing . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Thus , this case illustrates the problem that results not only when a court fails to construe the claims for the jury , but also when the fact-finder unduly focuses only on the function , way , result analysis of Graver Tank , 339 U.S. at 608 , 70 S.Ct . at 856 . These limited means of analysis fail to fully elucidate the issue , especially when the patented material is a chemical , as it is here . Is the increased half-life part of the `` way '' analysis or is it a different `` result '' ? Is the binding to fibrin `` function , '' as stated by the majority , or is it part of the `` way '' t-PA dissolves clots ? These questions illustrate the shortcomings of the function , way , result tests which relate to `` how '' a substance works , i.e. , what it does , rather than what it is , which claims purport to define . The other aspects of Graver Tank , if properly considered by the fact-finder , would have led to a sounder result . The substantiality of the difference between the accused and claimed compounds , the fact of independent development , and the lack of copying , all lead to a conclusion of lack of infringement . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 29 F.3d 1555 , 31 U.S.P.Q.2d 1161 _NEWLINE_ Footnotes _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In 1991 , pursuant to an amendment to Rule 50 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure , the former judgment notwithstanding the verdict ( JNOV ) was changed to a motion for JMOL . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 2 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ For a useful background on the subject , the reader is referred to Karl Drlica , Understanding DNA and Gene Cloning : A Guide for the Curious ( 1984 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 3 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As discussed further in this opinion , the Wellcome defendants are no longer parties to this action . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 4 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The amino acid sequence of natural t-PA consists of five separate domains or regions each having different functional attributes : the Finger ( F ) region , the Epidermal Growth ( E ) region , the Kringle 1 ( K1 ) region , the Kringle 2 ( K2 ) region , and the Serine Protease ( P ) region . The amino acid sequence of met-t-PA is the same length as that of natural t-PA , but differs from that sequence through an amino acid substitution at position 245 of the K2 region ( where methionine is substituted for valine ) . The FE1X protein takes its name from the fact that it lacks the Finger ( F ) region and most of the Epidermal Growth ( E ) region of natural t-PA , and eliminates one of the carbohydrate chains by altering the gene at position 117 of the K1 region ( where glutamine is substituted for arginine ) , thereby changing the glycosylation pattern ( 1X ) . It also has a different amino acid at position 245 ( the same substitution as met-t-PA ) . It is undisputed that neither met-t-PA or FE1X naturally occur in humans . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 5 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The specific claims that were found infringed were claim 1 of the '603 patent , claim 8 of the '075 patent , and claim 8 of the '330 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 6 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As we have repeatedly said , a determination of patent infringement is a two-step analysis .

'' Dr. Vehar testified that it means both the K1 and K2 regions . Dr. Goeddel testified that there is nothing in the patent indicating that both regions are not included in the term .

See In re Prater , 415 F.2d 1393 , 1404-05 , 162 USPQ 541 , 550 ( CCPA 1969 ) . The operative word is reasonable : the PTO has no such obligation regarding unreasonable interpretations . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 23 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Genentech characterized the effects of the amino acid substitution at position 117 of the K1 region as `` unexpected . '' European Patent Application Publication No . 0 238 304 , entitled `` MODIFIED HUMAN TISSUE-TYPE PLASMINOGEN ACTIVATOR AND ITS PREPARATION , '' filed by Genentech on March 17 , 1987 and published September 23 , 1987 , at 2 , ll . 55-59 .

The DNA isolate which is the subject of the '075 and '330 claims is itself defined in functional terms , i.e. , as any sequence that encodes human t-PA. A conclusion that the phrase `` human tissue plasminogen activator '' is also defined in functional terms would give rise to a definiteness problem because a competitor could not then reasonably determine what DNA sequences are within the scope of the claims and which are not . It would also give rise to a problem with the description requirement because the specification does not even remotely describe all the DNA sequences that encode the proteins within the scope of the functional definition . See Fiers v. Revel , 984 F.2d 1164 , 1171 , 25 USPQ2d 1601 , 1606 ( Fed.Cir.1993 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 26 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The record establishes that 25E10 differs in significant characteristics from natural t-PA , the inventors ' testimony to the contrary notwithstanding . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 27 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ It is undisputed that FE1X is not a naturally occurring variant of the full-length sequence of human t-PA . Thus , unlike the district court , we do not reach the issue of whether the phrase `` human tissue plasminogen activator '' as it appears in the claims includes within its scope naturally-occurring variants of the full-length sequence . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 28 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The jury was properly instructed that to find infringement under the doctrine of equivalents , they had to find that each limitation of the claim was met by the accused product either literally or by an equivalent .

But Dr. Collen testified that the `` consensus attitude '' of those who work in the area is that , if an assay is performed `` properly and carefully '' , the resulting measurement for native t-PA should be 500,000 plus or minus 25 % , i.e. , between 375,000 and 625,000 , and that a value above that range was not achievable in nature . The implication is that the reported figures , including the 440,000 figure , were all biased upwards due to the presence of a unknown factor which affected all . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 33 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The upper limit of the testified-to range , 299,484 , is significantly closer to the prior art value of 266,000 than it is to the lower limit of `` about 500,000 '' , i.e . 375,000 , as determined in accordance with Dr. Collen 's testimony . As Dr. Mann put it , the difference between the specific activity of FE1X and the claimed range is `` outside the range of quibbles . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 34 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The mean value of the testified-to range , 253,800 , is less than the prior art value of 266,000 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 35 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Prosecution history estoppel is a question of law , which we are free to analyze on appeal without deference to any implied finding of the jury on this issue .

This is a reflection of the rule enunciated in Perkin-Elmer Corp. v. Westinghouse Electric Corp. , 822 F.2d 1528 , 3 USPQ2d 1321 ( Fed.Cir.1987 ) that it is impermissible to erase under the doctrine of equivalents `` meaningful limitations of the claim on which the public is entitled to rely in avoiding infringement .

According to Dr. Marder 's and Dr. Collen 's testimony , the long half-life of FE1X in relation to human t-PA-about 40 minutes for FE1X versus about 4 minutes for human t-PA-is a significant advantage because it avoids the need for continuous administration over a prolonged period in order to remove a clot . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 43 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ `` Endothelial '' cells are the cells that make up the lining of blood vessels . The reduced binding affinity to endothelial cells is likewise a significant advantage because it reduces the risk of uncontrolled bleeding that is present with the administration of human t-PA. _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 44 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ See International Publication No .

Such a discussion is also premature given the pendency of Hilton Davis Chemical Co. v. Warner-Jenkinson Company , Inc. , No . 93-1088 , 1993 WL 502162 ( Fed.Cir . ordered en banc Dec. 3 , 1993 and argued en banc Mar . 3 , 1994 ) , in which the issue of whether factors other than the function/way/result factors are relevant to the doctrine of equivalents question is to be resolved by the full court . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 47 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In view of our disposition of this appeal , we need not reach the points made by the Genetics defendants relating to a new trial , or the binding effect of the judgment in relation to GI Manufacturing . We only observe that , as we have discussed , the trial court erred in undertaking the task of claim construction and then failing to instruct the jury on the proper claim construction it was to apply .

Billups-Rothenberg , Inc. ( `` Billups '' ) sued Associated Regional and University Pathologists , Inc. ( `` ARUP '' ) and Bio-Rad Laboratories , Inc. ( `` Bio-Rad '' ) alleging infringement of U.S. Patent Nos . 5,674,681 ( `` ¡¬681 patent '' ) and 6,355,425 ( `` ¡¬425 patent '' ) ( collectively , `` patents-in-suit '' ) . The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment . The district court denied Billups 's motion for summary judgment of infringement and granted ARUP and Bio-Rad 's motion for invalidity . In its order , the district court concluded that ( 1 ) the asserted claims of the ¡¬681 patent were invalid for lack of written description and ( 2 ) the asserted claims of the ¡¬425 patent were invalid as anticipated because U.S. Patent No . 6,025,130 ( `` ¡¬130 patent '' ) disclosed the claimed genetic test for a specific mutation implicated in Type I hereditary hemochromatosis . Order at 2 , Billups-Rothenberg , Inc. v. Associated Reg ' l & Univ . Pathologists , Inc. , No . 08-CV-21349 ( C.D.Cal . May 26 , 2010 ) , ECF No . 248 ( `` Summ . J . Order `` ) . Because the district court properly granted summary judgment on both asserted patents , we affirm . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ BACKGROUND _NEWLINE_ Deoxyribonucleic acid ( `` DNA '' ) is the chemical name for the genetic material that forms the basis of heredity in humans . DNA is composed of sequences of four nucleotides : adenine , thymine , guanine , and cytosine ( abbreviated A , T , G , and C , respectively ) arranged in functional units known as genes . Each gene codes for a sequence of amino acids that make up peptides and proteins . The relationship between a nucleotide sequence and the corresponding amino acid sequence is known as the genetic code . Mutations that alter a sequence of nucleotides may change the corresponding amino acid sequence , which in turn may affect the structure or function of the protein encoded by the gene . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ DNA is packaged into structures known as chromosomes . In somatic cells , humans have one pair of sex chromosomes and twenty-two pairs of autosomal chromosomes , which are numbered according to size from the largest to the smallest . One chromosome per pair is inherited from each parent . Each chromosome is composed of two arms , known as the short arm and long arm . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The patents-in-suit describe genetic tests for Type I hereditary hemochromatosis , an iron disorder characterized by excessive *1033 iron absorption by the body . Hereditary hemochromatosis is caused by specific mutations in a gene involved in regulating iron absorption . The gene in question , the High Fe ( `` HFE `` ) gene ( `` Fe '' is the chemical symbol for iron ) , is located on the short arm of chromosome six in humans . The HFE gene codes for the HFE protein , also known as the human hemochromatosis protein . When certain mutations occur in the HFE gene , the resulting mutated HFE protein results in increased iron absorption from the gut . Hereditary hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive condition , meaning that a person must inherit one mutated form of the HFE gene from each parent to develop the disease . Not everyone with two mutated HFE genes becomes clinically ill and , in some cases , inheriting only one mutated gene in combination with mutations in other genes may lead to some increased iron absorption . The claims of the patents-in-suit are directed to the detection of one or both of two distinct mutations in the HFE gene , known as C282Y and S65C . The prior art ¡¬130 patent describes three mutations in the HFE gene : C282Y , S65C , and H63D . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In 1994 , Billups filed the application for the ¡¬681 patent , entitled `` Methods to Identify Hemochromatosis . '' Dr. Barry E. Rothenberg , the founder of Billups , was named as the inventor . The ¡¬681 patent explains that Type I hereditary hemochromatosis ( `` hemochromatosis '' ) is a disease caused by a gene linked to the major histocompatibility complex ( `` MHC '' ) . ¡¬681 patent col.17 ll.51-54 . The genes associated with the MHC code for a variety of products , many of which defend the body against pathogens . The ¡¬681 patent identifies human chromosome six as the location of the gene responsible for hemochromatosis . Id . col.17 ll.53-54 . The specification of the ¡¬681 patent addresses how to detect a mutation : _NEWLINE_ A mutation in a nucleic acid sequence can be detected by various methods to analyze nucleic acids such as by nucleic acid sequencing , polymerase chain reaction or hybridization . Such methods are well known to those in the art ( see , for example , Sambrook et al , supra , 1989 ; Hames and Higgins Nucleic Acid Hybridisation : a practical approach ( IRL Press , New York , 1985 ) , both of which are incorporated herein by reference ) . _NEWLINE_ Id . col.23 ll.26-33 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Although some of the ¡¬681 patent 's claims also cover testing for hemochromatosis by detecting defective proteins in a patient 's blood , only claims covering the genetic test for what is now known as the C282Y mutation are asserted in this case . Claim 2 , which is representative of the asserted claims , reads : _NEWLINE_ 2 . A method to identify an individual having or predisposed to having hemochromatosis , comprising the steps of : _NEWLINE_ a ) providing from the individual a sample containing a gene encoding a nonclassical MHC class I heavy chain _NEWLINE_ and _NEWLINE_ b ) detecting a mutation in said gene , which mutation results in the reduced ability of said heavy chain to associate with said £]2 microglobulin , wherein the presence of said mutation identifies said individual as having or predisposed to having hemochromatosis . _NEWLINE_ Id . col.31 ll.19-24 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Although Billups claimed methods of detecting mutations responsible for hemochromatosis in the ¡¬681 patent , it had not yet identified any disease-causing mutations . In August of 1995 , Dr. Rothenberg employed Dr. Ritsuko Sawada-Hirai to help him identify the mutations responsible for hemochromatosis . They were unable *1034 to isolate the hemochromatosis gene or any mutations of the gene . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Others , however , had more success . In 1996 , Dr. John N. Feder and a group of scientists unaffiliated with Billups isolated and sequenced the hemochromatosis gene and published their results . John N. Feder et . al. , A Novel MHC Class I-like Gene is Mutated in Patients with Hereditary Haemochromatosis , 13 ( 4 ) Nature Genetics 399 ( 1996 ) . This group of researchers specifically noted that `` further refinement of the location of this gene has been difficult . '' Id . at 399 . This research resulted in numerous U.S. and foreign patents , including the ¡¬130 patent , entitled `` Hereditary Hemochromatosis Gene . '' The ¡¬130 patent discloses the exact genetic sequences for the three mutations at issue in this case : C282Y , H63D , and S65C . See , e.g. , fig.4A ( genetic code for the H63D and S65C mutations identified as 24d2 and 24d7 , respectively ) ; fig.4C ( genetic code for the C282Y mutation identified as 24d1 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ? _NEWLINE_ Also , the ¡¬130 patent describes genetic tests for hemochromatosis utilizing the mutations and sequence variants identified within the patent . Id . col.23 ll.10-67 . Bio-Rad is the assignee of the ¡¬130 patent and licenses it to ARUP , a laboratory at the University of Utah that provides genetic testing services . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Dr. Feder and his team published their discovery while ARUP was continuing to search for the hemochromatosis gene and its mutations . In October 1998 , a medical director at ARUP published a paper describing how the genetic probes for the H63D mutation also accidentally identified the nucleotide sequence A193T , which corresponds to the S65C mutation . ARUP developed this assay into the genetic test presently accused of infringing the patents-in-suit . The assay detected the C282Y , H63D , and S65C mutations in samples from patients . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ At the same time , the Billups researchers also used the genetic sequences discovered by Dr. Feder and his team to refine their own experiments . On March 26 , 1999 , Dr. Rothenberg , Dr. Sawada-Hirai , and collaborator Dr. James Barton filed the application that matured into the ¡¬425 patent . The ¡¬425 patent claims a method for diagnosing an iron disorder by testing for genetic mutations including S65C . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Claim 1 of the ¡¬425 patent appears below : _NEWLINE_ *1035 1 . A method of diagnosing an iron disorder or a genetic susceptibility to developing said disorder in a mammal , comprising determining the presence of a mutation in exon 2 of an HFE nucleic acid in a biological sample from said mammal , wherein said mutation is not a C¡÷G substitution at nucleotide 187 of SEQ ID NO : 1 and wherein the presence of said mutation is indicative of said disorder or a genetic susceptibility to developing said disorder . _NEWLINE_ ¡¬425 patent col.59 ll.19-26 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Table 1 of the ¡¬425 patent labels a genetic sequence identical to the genetic sequence in Figure 4A of the ¡¬130 patent as `` S65C . '' Cf . ¡¬425 patent col.1-2 Table 1 ( `` gagagtcgcc '' ) ; ¡¬130 patent fig.4A ( `` gagagtcgcc '' ) . Additionally , the ¡¬425 patent explains that two of the twenty hemochromatosis patients had the S65C mutation . ¡¬425 patent col.31 ll.20-37 table 6 , col.32 l.8 ( `` Probands 3 and 4 had a S65C mutation . '' ) The inventors of the ¡¬425 patent concluded that the S65C mutation could be used to diagnose hemochromatosis . Id . col.32 ll.8-13 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In 2009 , Billups sued ARUP and Bio-Rad for infringement of the patents-in-suit . Billups amended its complaint and alleged that ARUP and Bio-Rad infringe the patents-in-suit by `` providing and/or using diagnostic assays or kits for detecting hemochromatosis '' associated with one or both of the C282Y and S65C mutations . Am . Compl . ? 14 . After completion of discovery , a Markman hearing , and claim construction by the court , the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment . The district court granted summary judgment of invalidity for lack of a written description to ARUP and Bio-Rad . The district court found it undisputed that : `` The DNA sequence of the hemochromatosis gene and/or sequence of the C282Y mutation were not expressly specified in the ¡¬ 681 patent . '' Summ . J . Order 3 . Further , the district court noted that it is `` undisputed by the parties that no species of the genus of DNA mutations , the presence of which would identify an individual as having or being predisposed to having hemochromatosis , were disclosed in the ¡¬681 patent specification . '' Id . at 6 . The district court further stated that `` [ d ] escribing the structure of the resulting protein is not the same as describing the structure of the DNA and its mutations . The invention claimed in the ¡¬681 patent is a method to test for a DNA mutation , not a test for a defective protein . '' Id . Additionally , the district court explained that the `` patentee has merely directed the person of ordinary skill in the art to a general location of a mutation on a chromosome and suggested that the mutation may be found in that vicinity . '' Id . at 8 . The district court held the asserted claims of the ¡¬681 patent invalid for lack of written description . The district court concluded that ARUP and Bio-Rad 's enablement arguments were `` persuasive , '' but declined to rule on them in light of its ruling that the claims failed the written description requirement . Id . at 9 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court also granted summary judgment of invalidity of the ¡¬ 425 patent . First , it held that Bio-Rad 's ¡¬130 patent was prior art under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 102 ( e ) because it was filed on May 23 , 1996 , which is before the March 1999 filing date of the ¡¬425 patent . Id . at 3-4 , 10 . Then , the district court determined that the asserted claims of the ¡¬425 patent are anticipated because they claim `` the same genetic test for S65C as is disclosed in the ¡¬130 patent . '' Id . at 10 . The district court entered final judgment in favor of ARUP and Bio-Rad dismissing the case . This court has jurisdiction over Billups 's timely filed appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C . ¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1036 DISCUSSION _NEWLINE_ This court reviews an order of summary judgment de novo . See , e.g. , Amgen , Inc. v. Hoechst Marion Roussel , Inc. , 314 F.3d 1313 , 1339 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) . Summary judgment must be granted when , drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-movant , there is no genuine issue as to any material fact . Anderson v. Liberty Lobby , Inc. , 477 U.S. 242 , 248 , 106 S.Ct . 2505 , 91 L.Ed.2d 202 ( 1986 ) ; Fed.R.Civ.P . 56 ( c ) . We first examine whether the asserted claims of the ¡¬681 patent are invalid for lack of written description . Then , we determine whether the asserted claims of the ¡¬425 patent are invalid as anticipated . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I _NEWLINE_ Written description is a statutory requirement set forth in 35 U.S.C . ¡± 112 . The written description requirement requires the inventor to disclose the claimed invention so as to `` allow persons of ordinary skill in the art to recognize that [ the inventor ] invented what is claimed . '' Ariad Pharms. , Inc. v. Eli Lilly & Co. , 598 F.3d 1336 , 1351 ( Fed.Cir.2010 ) ( en banc ) ( internal quotations omitted ) . `` Requiring a written description of the invention limits patent protection to those who actually perform the difficult work of 'invention'-that is , conceive of and complete the final invention . '' Id . The written description requirement exists to ensure that inventors do not `` attempt to preempt the future before it has arrived . '' Fiers v. Revel , 984 F.2d 1164 , 1171 ( Fed.Cir.1993 ) . In Fiers , a party 's priority application failed to provide an adequate written description as it purported to cover all DNAs coding for a specific protein but did not describe the DNA . The party only provided a generic reference that the DNA could be obtained by reverse transcription and this court held that `` [ c ] laiming all DNA 's that achieve a result without defining what means will do so is not in compliance with the description requirement . '' Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The `` level of detail required to satisfy the written description requirement varies depending on the nature and scope of the claims and on the complexity and predictability of the relevant technology . '' Ariad , 598 F.3d at 1351 ( citing Capon v. Eshhar , 418 F.3d 1349 , 1357-58 ( Fed.Cir.2005 ) ) . `` [ A ] n adequate description of a DNA requires more than a mere statement that it is part of the invention and reference to a potential method for isolating it ; what is required is a description of the DNA itself . '' Regents of the Univ . of Cal . v. Eli Lilly & Co. , 119 F.3d 1559 , 1566-67 ( Fed.Cir.1997 ) ( internal quotations omitted ) . Complementary DNA ( `` cDNA '' ) is a form of DNA that only contains exons , stretches of DNA that code for genes . In Regents , a claim to a cDNA invention was held invalid as lacking written description because such a claim `` requires a specificity usually achieved by means of the recitation of the sequence of nucleotides that make up the cDNA . '' Id . at 1569 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Billups claims that its disclosure of the mutation 's general location somewhere `` within less than a 300 base pair region of a defined exon of a well studied multi-gene family , '' combined with the knowledge that existed at the time of filing the ¡¬681 patent , established that Dr. Rothenberg possessed the claimed invention . Appellant 's Br . 9 . The ¡¬681 patent claims a test for mutations , yet it is undisputed that the specification and originally filed claims of the ¡¬681 patent disclose neither the hemochromatosis gene sequence nor any specific mutations within that gene . Although the ¡¬681 patent states that the hemochromatosis mutations are in a gene encoding the a3 domain of a nonclassical MHC class I heavy chain located on the short arm of chromosome six , that does not disclose the exact location or sequence of the mutation . *1037 ¡¬681 patent col.32 ll.13-14 . Billups did not possess a genetic mutation useful for diagnosing hemochromatosis when it filed its patent application in December of 1994 . The ¡¬681 patent merely represents Billups 's research plan . See Ariad , 598 F.3d at 1351 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Billups maintains that based on knowledge outside the patent , including the subsequent discovery of C282Y , the ¡¬681 patent adequately described the envisioned , but then unknown , mutations . Given the lack of knowledge of sequences for the hemochromatosis gene and its mutations in the field , the limited extent and content of the prior art , and the immaturity and unpredictability of the science when the ¡¬681 patent was filed , Billups can not satisfy the written description requirement merely through references to later-acquired knowledge . This case is like Regents and Fiers , in which the DNA sequences at issue were unknown in the art . Regents , 119 F.3d at 1567-69 ; Fiers , 984 F.2d at 1171 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The ¡¬681 patent claims methods covering the identification of a genus of unknown genetic mutations . ¡¬681 patent col.31 ll.19-24 . A claim encompassing two or more disclosed embodiments within its scope is a genus claim . For genus claims , `` an adequate written description of a claimed genus requires more than a generic statement of an invention 's boundaries . '' Ariad , 598 F.3d at 1349 ( citing Regents , 119 F.3d at 1568 ) . Under Ariad , a patent must set forth `` either a representative number of species falling within the scope of the genus or structural features common to the members of the genus . '' Id . at 1350 . The ¡¬681 patent does not identify even a single species that satisfies the claims . In this case , the eventual discovery of only one species-the C282Y mutation-within the claimed genus does not constitute adequate written description of that genus . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Ariad also explained that `` [ f ] unctional claim language can meet the written description requirement when the art has established a correlation between structure and function . '' Id . Billups maintains that the ¡¬681 patent satisfies the written description requirement because it contains functional claim language . Billups contends that the ¡¬681 patent taught structure , i.e. , that hemochromatosis has a genetic basis , and function , namely , its adverse effect upon the binding of £]2 microglobulin with a nonclassical MHC class I heavy chain . Specifically , Billups argues that the ¡¬681 patent 's correlation of function with the general location of the C282Y mutation , combined with the knowledge of a person of ordinary skill in the art in the field at the time of filing , satisfied the written description requirement by localizing the mutation to a 300 base pair region . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court , however , found that the art did not establish a correlation between structure and function because the `` [ p ] atentee 's general location disclosure is too imprecise to constitute structural features necessary to meet the written description requirement . '' Summ . J . Order 6-9 . As explained in the district court 's order , the `` specification for the ¡¬ 681 patent contains only functional , not structural , characteristics of the predicted mutations . '' Id . at 7 . The district court properly granted summary judgment to Appellees that there is no genuine issue of material fact that the asserted claims of the ¡¬681 patent are invalid for lack of written description requirement . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Finally , Billups argues that the district court erred in failing to rule upon whether the ¡¬681 patent satisfied the enablement requirement of 35 U.S.C . ¡± 112 . Because the district court properly granted summary *1038 judgment that the ¡¬681 patent does not satisfy the written description requirement , it was not erroneous for it to decline to rule upon whether the ¡¬681 patent satisfied the enablement requirement of 35 U.S.C . ¡± 112 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ II _NEWLINE_ A patent claim is anticipated if each and every limitation is found either expressly or inherently in a single prior art reference . 35 U.S.C . ¡± 102 . The asserted claims of the ¡¬425 patent are invalid because they are anticipated by the ¡¬130 patent . The ¡¬130 patent was filed nearly three years before the ¡¬425 patent and is prior art under ¡± 102 ( e ) . The district court correctly ruled that the ¡¬130 patent discloses use of the S65C mutation as a `` HH [ ( hereditary hemochromatosis ) ] diagnostic , '' and , thus , Billups was not the first to disclose diagnosis of hemochromatosis using the S65C mutation . Summ . J . Order 11 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The ¡¬130 patent discloses the genetic sequence of the S65C mutation and describes a genetic assay for detecting one or more of the C282Y , H63D , and S65C mutations . In an example entitled `` HH Diagnostic : Other Nucleotide Based Assays , '' the specification of the ¡¬130 patent states that _NEWLINE_ any combination of such techniques [ for conducting a genetic assay ] can be used in accordance with the invention for the design of a diagnostic device and method for the screening of samples of DNA or RNA for HH gene mutations in accordance with the invention , such as the mutations and sequence variants identified herein ( 24d1 , 24d2 , and 24d7 ) . _NEWLINE_ ¡¬130 patent col.38 l.64-col.39 l.8 . The variants correspond to the C282Y , H63D , and S65C mutations , respectively . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Billups contests whether the ¡¬130 patent discloses the subject of the ¡¬ 425 patent , namely , the diagnosis of an iron disorder using the S65C mutation . It is undisputed that the S65C mutation falls within claim 1 of the ¡¬425 patent . Billups argues that the ¡¬425 patent claims a genetic predisposition to an iron disorder or the diagnosis of such a predisposition , but the ¡¬130 patent merely correlates the S65C mutation and hemochromatosis . Billups interprets the ¡¬130 patent as concluding that the S65C mutation was only a clinically insignificant polymorphism unrelated to disease state . Thus , Billups contends that the ¡¬130 patent did not teach using the S65C mutation to diagnose hemochromatosis . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Billups 's argument is based on the portion of the ¡¬130 patent stating : _NEWLINE_ In Table 4 , the 24d7 ( T ) allele was observed in only one chromosome present in the patient sample ( HC43 ) ( 0.4 % ) and present in four chromosomes from the unaffected individuals ( 3 % ) . The presence of the 24d7 ( T ) allele shows no increase in risk of acquiring HH and thus may only be a polymorphic variant within the population . _NEWLINE_ Id . col.19 ll.22-27 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Despite the inventors ' uncertainty regarding the utility of the S65C mutation because of their small sample size , the ¡¬130 patent describes two genetic tests for hemochromatosis that involve detection of the S65C mutation as an input for the diagnosis of hemochromatosis . The patent describes one genetic test as `` HH diagnostic , '' meaning that it could be used in the diagnosis of hemochromatosis . Id . col.38 l.65-col.39 l.40 . The patent also describes a test kit for hemochromatosis mutations , including S65C . Id . col.38 ll.49-52 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Although the ¡¬130 patent discounts the utility of the S65C mutation in diagnosing hemochromatosis , we have held that a `` reference is no less anticipatory if , after disclosing the invention , the reference then *1039 disparages it . '' Celeritas Techs. , Ltd. v. Rockwell Int ' l Corp. , 150 F.3d 1354 , 1361 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) . Indeed , in Celeritas , this court explained that `` whether a reference 'teaches away ' from the invention is inapplicable to an anticipation analysis . '' Id . ( quoting Kalman v. Kimberly-Clark Corp. , 713 F.2d 760 , 772 ( Fed.Cir.1983 ) ) . In Celeritas , this court considered prior art stating that `` de-emphasis would cause severe inter-symbol interference in a single-carrier data signal ; it may be feasible only for multicarrier signals . '' Id . ( emphasis added ) . This court held that the disclosure was sufficient to anticipate and invalidate the claims of the asserted patent , as `` [ t ] he fact that a modem with a single carrier data signal is shown to be less than optimal does not vitiate the fact that it is disclosed . The modem in the article is not disclosed to be inoperative . '' Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Like the prior art reference in Celeritas , the ¡¬130 patent discloses using the S65C mutation when diagnosing hemochromatosis , but qualifies that disclosure with the observation that the mutation `` may only be a polymorphic variant . '' ¡¬130 patent col.19 ll.25-27 ( emphasis added ) . In both cases , the prior art questioned the utility of an application of the disclosed invention but , nevertheless , disclosed the invention . Likewise , the Kalman case states that `` it is only necessary that the claims under attack , as construed by the court , read on something disclosed in the reference . '' 713 F.2d at 772 , overruled in part on other grounds , SRI Int ' l v. Matsushita Elec . Corp. of Am. , 775 F.2d 1107 , 1125 ( Fed.Cir.1985 ) ( en banc ) ( internal quotations omitted ) . In the present case , the district court correctly recognized that the ¡¬130 patent discloses a diagnostic test for hemochromatosis that included identification of the S65C mutation , and , therefore , anticipated the ¡¬ 425 patent 's claims . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ At oral argument , Billups conceded that it waived its argument that the ¡¬130 patent can not be used to anticipate because the relevant teachings were not enabled . Oral Arg . at 25:23-25:50 ; 29:23-29:56 , available at http : // www.cafc.uscourts.gov/oral-argument-recordings/all/billups.html . Even if this argument had not been waived , the district court presumes the enablement of the material in a prior art patent , and Billups failed to present evidence of nonenablement that the district court found persuasive . The ¡¬130 patent may be used to anticipate the ¡¬425 patent . Even though the inventors of the ¡¬ 425 patent performed experiments revealing greater diagnostic utility of the S65C mutation than initially suspected , the use of the S65C mutation as a diagnostic tool was already contemplated by the ¡¬130 patent . Accordingly , there is no genuine issue of material fact that the asserted claims of the ¡¬ 425 patent are invalid because they are anticipated by the ¡¬130 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ CONCLUSION _NEWLINE_ Because the district court properly granted summary judgment to Appellees that the asserted claims of the ¡¬681 patent are invalid for lack of written description and the asserted claims of the ¡¬425 patent are invalid as anticipated , we affirm the judgment of the district court . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ AFFIRMED _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ COSTS _NEWLINE_ No costs . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 642 F.3d 1031 , 98 U.S.P.Q.2d 1578

( `` Bruno '' ) appeals from the decision of the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin awarding attorney fees to Acorn Mobility Services , Ltd. and Acorn Stairlifts , Inc. ( collectively `` Acorn '' ) pursuant to 35 U.S.C . ¡± 285 for an `` exceptional case , '' predicated on a determination that Bruno engaged in inequitable conduct while prosecuting United States Patent 5,230,405 . Bruno Indep . Living Aids , Inc. v. Acorn Mobility Servs. , Ltd. , 277 F.Supp.2d 965 ( W.D.Wis.2003 ) . In case we were to disturb the exceptional case finding , Acorn conditionally cross-appeals from the district court 's decision denying further discovery on that issue . Bruno Indep . Living Aids , Inc. v. Acorn Mobility Servs. , Ltd. , No . 02-C-0391-C ( W.D.Wis . June 9 , 2003 ) . We affirm . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ BACKGROUND _NEWLINE_ Bruno manufactures and sells `` stairlifts , '' which are devices that allow persons with mobility impairments to ascend and descend stairways on a chair that travels along a rail . In November 1991 , Bruno filed a patent application at the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( `` PTO '' ) directed to a stairlift , which issued as the '405 patent in July 1993 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In July 2002 , Bruno sued Acorn , a competitor , alleging infringement of claims 5 , 9 , 10 , and 15 of the '405 patent . During discovery , Acorn produced numerous disclosures of prior art stairlifts that had not been considered by the patent examiner , and thereafter moved for summary judgment of noninfringement and invalidity . Admitting that the asserted claims were invalid in view of the prior art identified by Acorn , Bruno filed a reissue application at the PTO , the fate of which is immaterial to this appeal . In due course , the district court granted Acorn 's motion for summary judgment,1 declaring claims 5 , 9 , 10 , and 15 invalid . Bruno Indep . Living Aids , Inc. v. Acorn Mobility Servs. , Ltd. , 286 F.Supp.2d 1020 ( W.D.Wis.2003 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Subsequently , Acorn accused Bruno of having intentionally withheld invalidating prior art from the PTO , and asked the district court to declare the case `` exceptional '' for the purpose of awarding attorney fees under ¡± 285.2 Acorn also requested additional discovery to the extent the district court required further evidence to justify a fee award . Upon briefing by both parties , the district court declared the case exceptional after determining that Bruno had engaged in inequitable conduct while prosecuting the '405 patent , and consequently denied Acorn 's motion for additional discovery . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As the ground for its inequitable conduct determination , the district court found that Bruno had failed to disclose to the PTO information on several invalidating prior art stairlifts that Bruno had submitted to the Food and Drug Administration ( `` FDA '' ) in seeking approval to sell a stairlift covered by the '405 patent . Observing that the disclosure to the FDA occurred concurrently with the prosecution of the '405 patent , the district court-noting the absence of a credible , good faith explanation from Bruno for not disclosing *1351 the same information to the PTO-inferred that the information had been withheld with deceptive intent . The district court thereupon concluded that Bruno had engaged in inequitable conduct , which it deemed sufficient to render the case exceptional for the purpose of imposing a fee award under ¡± 285 . Final judgment was entered in November 2003 , in which Bruno was ordered to pay Acorn $ 399,459.32 in attorney fees . Bruno Indep . Living Aids , Inc. v. Acorn Mobility Servs. , Ltd. , No . 02-C-0391-C , 2003 WL 23095743 ( W.D.Wis . Nov. 6 , 2003 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On appeal , Bruno challenges the district court 's determination of an exceptional case . In response , Acorn conditionally cross-appeals from the ruling denying additional discovery on that issue . We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C . ¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ DISCUSSION _NEWLINE_ Patent applicants3 owe a `` duty of candor and good faith '' to the PTO . 37 C.F.R . ¡± 1.56 ( a ) ( 2004 ) ; see also Molins PLC v. Textron , Inc. , 48 F.3d 1172 , 1178 ( Fed.Cir.1995 ) . A breach of this duty may constitute inequitable conduct , which can arise from a failure to disclose4 information material to patentability , coupled with an intent to deceive or mislead the PTO . Molins , 48 F.3d at 1178 . Materiality and intent must be established by clear and convincing evidence , Kingsdown Med . Consultants , Ltd. v. Hollister , Inc. , 863 F.2d 867 , 872 ( Fed.Cir.1988 ) , and then weighed `` to determine whether the equities warrant a conclusion that inequitable conduct occurred . '' Molins , 48 F.3d at 1178 . The ultimate determination of inequitable conduct is therefore a matter `` committed to the discretion of the trial court '' and is reviewed for an abuse of discretion . Kingsdown , 863 F.2d at 876 ( en banc in relevant part ) . The underlying findings on materiality and intent are reviewed for clear error , and will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of a `` definite and firm conviction '' that a mistake has been made . Id . at 872 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A . Knowledge of Prior Art _NEWLINE_ In its inequitable conduct determination , the district court found that Bruno deliberately withheld from the PTO information on several invalidating prior art stairlifts , focusing its analysis on the `` Wecolator '' manufactured by The Cheney Company , among others.5 While conceding awareness of the Wecolator 's existence during prosecution , Bruno contends that a duty to disclose did not arise because it had failed to appreciate the Wecolator 's materiality at that time . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We see no error in the district court 's treatment of the Wecolator as prior *1352 art that was subject to the duty of disclosure . The record supports the district court 's finding that Bruno possessed actual knowledge of the Wecolator-and that it knew or should have known of its materiality . In an April 20 , 1992 letter to the FDA , Bruno sought approval to sell its SRE-1500 stairlift , which was an embodiment covered by the then-pending application that matured into the '405 patent . ( J.A . 2198 ) . In a paragraph labeled `` Substantial Equivalence '' in the FDA letter , William Belson , Bruno 's Director of Engineering , claimed that the SRE-1500 stairlift was `` similar in design and function '' to the units manufactured by `` Cheney Manufacturing Inc. '' Id . Product information on the `` Weckalator '' [ sic ] was listed as an enclosure with the FDA letter . ( J.A . 2199 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Bruno argues that its claim of `` substantial equivalence '' between the SRE-1500 stairlift and the Wecolator was relevant only for the purpose of securing FDA approval , and that it had no bearing on whether Bruno knew the Wecolator to be material prior art for purposes of patentability . This distinction is disingenuous in light of what the record reflects : the FDA submission was prepared by William Belson , who was also involved in the prosecution of the '405 patent and had asked Bruno 's patent attorney to conduct a prior art search in preparation for filing the patent application . ( J.A . 2859-61 ) . More importantly , Bruno 's distinction is not persuasive because `` an applicant who knew of the art or information can not intentionally avoid learning of its materiality ... it may be found that the applicant 'should have known ' of that materiality . '' FMC Corp. v. Manitowoc Co. , 835 F.2d 1411 , 1415 ( Fed.Cir.1987 ) ( footnote omitted ) . Accordingly , we are not persuaded that the district court clearly erred in charging Bruno with knowledge of the Wecolator 's materiality . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B. Materiality _NEWLINE_ Regardless whether it knew the Wecolator to be invalidating prior art , Bruno argues that the Wecolator is simply not material , but rather is cumulative , to the information submitted to the PTO , such that its nondisclosure can not provide a ground for finding inequitable conduct . We do not agree . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In evaluating materiality , we have consistently referred to the definition provided in 37 C.F.R . ¡± 1.56 , by which the PTO has promulgated the duty of disclosure . See , e.g. , Critikon , Inc. v. Becton Dickinson Vascular Access , Inc. , 120 F.3d 1253 , 1257 ( Fed.Cir.1997 ) ( discussing the version of the rule in effect since 1992 ) ; J.P. Stevens & Co. v. Lex Tex Ltd. , 747 F.2d 1553 , 1559 ( Fed.Cir.1984 ) ( applying the pre-1992 version of the rule ) . In 1992 , the definition of materiality in 37 C.F.R . ¡± 1.56 was revised . As defined in the current version of the rule , information is material to patentability when : _NEWLINE_ [ I ] t is not cumulative to information already of record or being made of record in the application , and _NEWLINE_ ( 1 ) It establishes , by itself or in combination with other information , a prima facie case of unpatentability of a claim ; or _NEWLINE_ ( 2 ) It refutes , or is inconsistent with , a position the applicant takes in : _NEWLINE_ ( i ) Opposing an argument of unpatentability relied on by the Office , or _NEWLINE_ ( ii ) Asserting an argument of patentability . _NEWLINE_ 37 C.F.R . ¡± 1.56 ( b ) ( 2004 ) ( emphases added ) . According to the PTO 's notice of final rulemaking , the rule change applied to all applications pending or filed after March 16 , 1992 . Duty of Disclosure , 57 Fed . Reg . 2021 ( Jan. 17 , 1992 ) . Thus , the new rule was applicable during the prosecution of the '405 patent , and we evaluate the materiality *1353 of the Wecolator under the standard set forth in the applicable amended rule . In doing so , we give deference to the PTO 's formulation at the time an application is being prosecuted before an examiner of the standard of conduct it expects to be followed in proceedings in the Office . In light of this definition , we discern no error in the district court 's finding of materiality based on its assessment that the disclosure of the Wecolator to the PTO would have precluded Bruno from advancing certain arguments in favor of patentability . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Specifically , the prosecution history shows that Bruno amended the claim that eventually issued as claim 15 `` to more clearly define the novel and nonobvious attributes , '' ( J.A . 911 ) , by adding a limitation that required the stairlift 's swivel seat to have an off-center pivot that was proximate to the front edge of the seat . ( J.A . 906 ) . Claim 15 , as issued , reads as follows : _NEWLINE_ A chairlift device comprising : _NEWLINE_ a ) a rail ; _NEWLINE_ b ) a carriage unit housing motor means operatively engaging said rail , said carriage unit moving between first and second terminal positions on said rail ; _NEWLINE_ c ) a seat assembly mounted to said carriage unit , said seat assembly comprising : _NEWLINE_ i ) a seat bracket having a front edge and a rear edge , a backrest being mounted at said rear edge of said bracket ; _NEWLINE_ ii ) a swivel tube fixed to the bottom of said seat bracket proximate to said front edge of said bracket ; _NEWLINE_ iii ) a swivel mounting bracket fixed to the top of said carriage unit and mounted to said carriage unit proximate to the front of said carriage unit ; _NEWLINE_ iv ) means for selectively locking said seat assembly in a preselected position ; _NEWLINE_ wherein said swivel tube coaxially fits within said swivel mounting bracket and further wherein said swivel tube is free to rotate axially within said swivel mounting bracket . _NEWLINE_ '405 patent , col. 11 , l. 22 through col. 12 , l. 15 ( emphases added ) . In patentably distinguishing the amended claim over the prior art , Bruno argued to the PTO that : _NEWLINE_ Claim [ 15 ] now calls for the swivel tube and mounting bracket to be mounted proximate to the front edge of the carriage unit and seat assembly . This feature provides several advantages neither taught nor suggested by the references cited by the Examiner . _NEWLINE_ ... [ H ] aving a front offset pivot point for the seat allows the rail and other components of the chairlift to be mounted closer to the wall of the stairway than seats having center pivot points as shown in the prior art . _NEWLINE_ ( J.A . 911-12 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Had the examiner known about the Wecolator , however , Bruno could not have touted the front offset swivel as a point of novelty . According to the deposition testimony of Robert Bartelt , the sole named inventor on the '405 patent , the Wecolator had an optional seat assembly with an off-center swivel that provided similar advantages over the prior art seats having center pivots . ( J.A . 2532-33 ) . The Wecolator , therefore , satisfies the criteria for materiality specified in 37 C.F.R . ¡± 1.56 ( b ) ( 2 ) ( ii ) . Nevertheless , Bruno insists that the Wecolator was cumulative to the prior art of record in view of its submission of United States Patent 4,913,264 ( `` Voves '' ) to the PTO . We disagree ; unlike the Wecolator , the stairlift disclosed in Voves does not have a seat assembly with an offset swivel , but rather one that *1354 has a center pivot . Thus , on the evidence presented , we do not consider the district court 's finding of materiality to be clearly erroneous . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ C. Intent _NEWLINE_ Finally , Bruno ascribes error to the district court 's reliance on so-called `` negative inferences '' to support its finding that Bruno acted with deceptive intent in failing to disclose the Wecolator to the PTO . Bruno also accuses the district court of misstating facts and according insufficient weight to certain evidence . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Based on our review of the record , these contentions do not warrant reversal . While the district court indeed provided little explicit support for its finding of intent , it is well established that , as an appellate tribunal , we review judgments , not opinions . See Black v. Cutter Labs. , 351 U.S. 292 , 297 , 76 S.Ct . 824 , 100 L.Ed . 1188 ( 1956 ) ; Stratoflex , Inc. v. Aeroquip Corp. , 713 F.2d 1530 , 1540 ( Fed.Cir.1983 ) . We therefore focus our review on whether there is sufficient evidence in the record to sustain the judgment of intent to deceive the PTO . Consol . Aluminum Corp. v. Foseco Int ' l Ltd. , 910 F.2d 804 , 814 ( Fed.Cir.1990 ) ( `` An appellate court need not close its eyes to the record where ... there is a way clearly open to affirm the district court 's action. '' ) . In the present case , we find sufficient evidence based upon which a fair inference of deceptive intent may be drawn , in view of the high materiality of the Wecolator . See Brasseler , U.S.A . I , L.P. v. Stryker Sales Corp. , 267 F.3d 1370 , 1381 ( Fed.Cir.2001 ) ( `` When balanced against high materiality , the showing of intent can be proportionally less. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ `` Intent need not , and rarely can , be proven by direct evidence . '' Merck & Co. , Inc. v. Danbury Pharmacal . Inc. , 873 F.2d 1418 , 1422 ( Fed.Cir.1989 ) . Rather , in the absence of a credible explanation , intent to deceive is generally inferred from the facts and circumstances surrounding a knowing failure to disclose material information . See Paragon Podiatry Lab. , Inc. v. KLM Labs . Inc. , 984 F.2d 1182 , 1193 ( Fed.Cir.1993 ) . The particular facts and circumstances of the present case correspond in all relevant aspects to those cases in which we have upheld inferential findings of deceptive intent on similar key evidence . See , e.g. , LaBounty Mfg. , Inc. , v. United States Int ' l Trade Comm ' n , 958 F.2d 1066 , 1076 ( Fed.Cir.1992 ) ( ruling that inference of deceptive intent was supported by evidence of applicant making patentability arguments that could not have been made had the withheld prior art been disclosed ) ; Merck , 873 F.2d at 1420-22 ( ruling that inference of deceptive intent was supported by `` damning '' evidence that included applicant having submitted material information to the FDA while simultaneously withholding it from the PTO , and attempting to explain the disparity of its FDA and PTO submissions in a way that `` strains credulity '' ) . The fact that an official of Bruno , who was involved in both the FDA and PTO submissions , chose to disclose the Wecolator to the FDA , but not to the PTO , certainly supports a finding of deceptive intent to withhold the disclosure from the PTO . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ More importantly , Bruno has not proffered a credible explanation for the nondisclosure , and an inference of deceptive intent may fairly be drawn in the absence of such an explanation . Cf . Dayco Prods. , Inc. v. Total Containment , Inc. , 329 F.3d 1358 , 1367 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) ( `` Intent to deceive can not be inferred simply from the decision to withhold the reference where the reasons given for the withholding are plausible. '' ) . Normally , it can be expected that an innocent party will be motivated to try to present convincing reasons for its actions or inaction . That did not occur here . Accordingly , we can not *1355 assign clear error to the district court 's inferential finding that Bruno intentionally withheld the Wecolator prior art in an attempt to mislead the PTO . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Because the district court 's findings on materiality and intent were not clearly erroneous , there was no abuse of discretion in its determination that Bruno procured the '405 patent through inequitable conduct . Because inequitable conduct can be one of several bases sufficient to make a case exceptional for the purpose of awarding attorney fees under ¡± 285 , see A.B . Chance Co. v. RTE Corp. , 854 F.2d 1307 , 1312 ( Fed.Cir.1988 ) , we do not find reversible error in the determination of an exceptional case . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We have considered the parties ' other arguments and conclude that they are either unpersuasive or unnecessary for resolution of this appeal . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ CONCLUSION _NEWLINE_ For the foregoing reasons , we conclude that the district court did not err in its determination of an exceptional case based on its determination that Bruno committed inequitable conduct . Acorn 's cross-appeal for additional discovery has been accordingly rendered moot . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Because Bruno 's appeal was not frivolous , we deny Acorn 's motion for an award of double costs and attorney fees under Fed .

Because the circumstances surrounding Bruno 's failure to disclose information on the Wecolator alone provide sufficient grounds for sustaining the inequitable conduct determination , we need not address the district court 's treatment of the other two stairlifts-the American Stair-Glide models 37 and 65 .

( `` Teva '' ) appeals from a final judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Delaware in favor of The Procter & Gamble Company ( `` P & G '' ) in three cases upholding the validity of P & G 's U.S. Patent 5,583,122 ( the `` ¡¬122 patent '' ) . Procter & Gamble Co. v. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA , Inc. , 536 F.Supp.2d 476 ( D.Del.2008 ) . After a bench trial and a stipulation for judgment in the related cases , the district court rejected Teva 's invalidity defenses of obviousness and obviousness-type double patenting . We affirm . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I . BACKGROUND _NEWLINE_ The ¡¬122 patent claims the compound risedronate , the active ingredient of P & G 's osteoporosis drug Actonel ( r ) . In August 2004 , P & G sued Teva for infringement of the ¡¬122 patent after Teva notified P & G that it planned to market risedronate as a generic equivalent of Actonel ( r ) . Specifically , P & G alleged that Teva 's proposed drug infringed claim 4 of the ¡¬122 patent for the compound risedronate , claim 16 for pharmaceutical compositions containing risedronate , and claim 23 for methods of treating diseases using risedronate . In its defense , Teva argued that the ¡¬ *993 122 patent was invalid as obvious in light of P & G 's expired U.S. Patent 4,761,406 ( the `` ¡¬406 patent '' ) , filed on June 6 , 1985 and issued on August 2 , 1988 . Alternately , Teva argues that the ¡¬122 patent is invalid for obviousness-type double patenting . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Risedronate , the subject of the contested claims , is a member of a group of compounds referred to as bisphosphonates . Bisphosphonates , in general , are active in inhibiting bone resorption . The first two promising bisphosphonates studied for the treatment of metabolic bone diseases , etidronate ( EHDP ) and clodronate , had clinical problems which prevented their commercialization . P & G conducted a significant amount of experimentation involving hundreds of different bisphosphonate compounds , but could not predict the efficacy or toxicity of the new compounds . Eventually , researchers at P & G identified risedronate as a promising drug candidate . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On December 6 , 1985 , risedronate 's inventors applied for a patent on the compound . P & G is the owner by assignment of the ¡¬122 patent , entitled `` Pharmaceutical Compositions Containing Geminal Diphosphonates , '' which issued on December 10 , 1996 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Risedronate is neither claimed nor disclosed in the ¡¬406 patent . Instead , the ¡¬406 patent , entitled `` Regimen for Treating Osteoporosis , '' claims an intermittent dosing method for treating osteoporosis . As the trial court noted , the ¡¬406 patent `` addresses the central problem seen in bisphosphonates at the time , namely that they inhibited bone mineralization , by teaching the use of a cyclic administrative regimen to achieve a separation of the benign effect of anti-resorption from the unwanted side effect of anti-mineralization in patients . '' Procter & Gamble , 536 F.Supp.2d at 492 . The ¡¬ 406 patent lists thirty-six polyphosphonate molecules as treatment candidates and eight preferred compounds for intermittent dosing , including 2-pyr EHDP . Teva contends that the structural similarities between risedronate and 2-pyr EHDP render the challenged claims of the ¡¬122 patent obvious . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ From the testimony at trial , the district court concluded that the ¡¬ 406 patent would not have led a person of ordinary skill in the art to identify 2-pyr EHDP as the lead compound . In light of the extremely unpredictable nature of bisphosphonates at the time of the invention , the district court also found that a person of ordinary skill in the art would not have been motivated to make the specific molecular modifications to make risedronate . The district court concluded that unexpected results of risedronate 's potency and toxicity rebut a claim of obviousness . The district court found that secondary considerations of non-obviousness supported its conclusions . Similarly , the court found that the ¡¬122 patent was not invalid for obviousness-type double patenting . This consolidated appeal followed . We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C . ¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ II . DISCUSSION _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I .

Patent Obviousness-Legal Standard _NEWLINE_ Under the U.S. Patent Act , an invention can not be patented if `` the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains . '' 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 ( a ) . Patents are presumed to be valid . Kao Corp. v. Unilever U.S. , Inc. , 441 F.3d 963 , 968 ( Fed.Cir.2006 ) . A party seeking to invalidate a patent based on obviousness must demonstrate `` by clear and convincing evidence that a skilled artisan would have been motivated to combine the teachings of the prior art references to achieve the claimed invention , and that the skilled artisan would have had a reasonable expectation of success in doing so . '' Pfizer , Inc. v. Apotex , Inc. , 480 F.3d 1348 , 1361 ( Fed.Cir.2007 ) . Clear and convincing evidence places in the fact finder `` an abiding conviction that the truth of [ the ] factual contentions are highly probable . '' Colorado v. New Mexico , 467 U.S. 310 , 316 , 104 S.Ct . 2433 , 81 L.Ed.2d 247 ( 1984 ) ( quotation marks omitted ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The obviousness determination turns on underlying factual inquiries involving : ( 1 ) the scope and content of prior art , ( 2 ) differences between claims and prior art , ( 3 ) the level of ordinary skill in pertinent art , and ( 4 ) secondary considerations such as commercial success and satisfaction of a long-felt need . Graham v. John Deere Co. , 383 U.S. 1 , 17 , 86 S.Ct . 684 , 15 L.Ed.2d 545 ( 1966 ) .

Accordingly , under KSR , `` it remains necessary to identify some reason that would have led a chemist to modify a known compound in a particular manner to establish prima facie obviousness of a new claimed compound . '' Takeda Chem . Indus. , Ltd. v. Alphapharm Pty. , Ltd. , 492 F.3d 1350 , 1357 ( Fed.Cir.2007 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ If a patent challenger makes a prima facie showing of obviousness , the owner may rebut based on `` unexpected results '' by demonstrating `` that the claimed invention exhibits some superior property or advantage that a person of ordinary skill in the relevant art would have found surprising or unexpected . '' In re Soni , 54 F.3d 746 , 750 ( Fed.Cir.1995 ) . We consider the relevant factors in turn . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ III . Identification of a Lead Compound _NEWLINE_ An obviousness argument based on structural similarity between claimed and prior art compounds `` clearly depends on a preliminary finding that one of ordinary skill in the art would have selected [ the prior art compound ] as a lead compound . '' Takeda , 492 F.3d at 1359 ; see also Eisai Co. Ltd. v. Dr. Reddy 's Labs. , Ltd. , 533 F.3d 1353 , 1359 ( Fed.Cir.2008 ) ( stating that `` post-KSR , a prima facie case of obviousness for a chemical compound still , in general , begins with the reasoned identification of a lead compound '' in the prior art ) . Teva argues that the ¡¬406 patent identifies 2-pyr EHDP as the most promising molecule for the inhibition of bone resorption . The trial court disagreed and concluded from the evidence that a *995 person of ordinary skill in the art would not have identified 2-pyr EHDP as a lead compound for the treatment of osteoporosis . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We need not reach this question because we conclude that even if 2-pyr EHDP was a lead compound , the evidence does not establish that it would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill at the time of the invention to modify 2-pyr EHDP to create risedronate . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ IV . Obviousness of Risedronate in Light of the Prior Art _NEWLINE_ To decide whether risedronate was obvious in light of the prior art , a court must determine whether , at the time of invention , a person having ordinary skill in the art would have had `` reason to attempt to make the composition '' known as risedronate and `` a reasonable expectation of success in doing so . '' PharmaStem Therapeutics , Inc. v. ViaCell , Inc. , 491 F.3d 1342 , 1360 ( Fed.Cir.2007 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court concluded that , even if 2-pyr EHDP were a lead compound , it would not render the ¡¬122 patent 's claims on risedronate obvious because a person having ordinary skill in the art would not have had reason to make risedronate based on the prior art . The district court 's findings also support the conclusion that there could have been no reasonable expectation as to risedronate 's success . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The question of obviousness `` often turns on the structural similarities and differences between the claimed compound and the prior art compound [ ] . '' Eisai Co. Ltd. v. Dr. Reddy 's Labs. , Ltd. , 533 F.3d 1353 , 1356-57 ( Fed.Cir.2008 ) ; see also Sanofi-Synthelabo v. Apotex , Inc. , 550 F.3d 1075 , 1086 ( Fed.Cir.2008 ) ( `` Precedent establishes the analytical procedure whereby a close structural similarity between a new chemical compound and prior art compounds is generally deemed to create a prima facie case of obviousness ... . '' ) ; In re Mayne , 104 F.3d 1339 , 1343 ( Fed.Cir.1997 ) ( `` Structural relationships often provide the requisite motivation to modify known compounds to obtain new compounds . `` ) ; In re Payne , 606 F.2d 303 , 313-15 ( CCPA 1979 ) ( discussing the presumption of obviousness based on close structural similarity ) . In this case , risedronate and 2-pyr EHDP are positional isomers ; they each contain the same atoms arranged in different ways . In risedronate , the hydroxy-ethanediphosphonate group is connected to the # 3 carbon of a pyridine ring , while in 2-pyr EHDP , the hydroxy-ethane-diphosphonate group is connected to the # 2 carbon . Because the nitrogen atom is in a different position in the two molecules , they differ in three dimensional shape , charge distribution and hydrogen bonding properties . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ To successfully argue that a new compound is obvious , the challenger may show `` that the prior art would have suggested making the specific molecular modifications necessary to achieve the claimed invention . '' Takeda , 492 F.3d at 1356 ( quotation marks omitted ) . `` In keeping with the flexible nature of the obviousness inquiry , the requisite motivation [ to modify ] can come from any number of sources . '' Eisai , 533 F.3d at 1357 ( citation omitted ) . Thus , in addition to structural similarity between the compounds , a prima facie case of obviousness may be shown by `` adequate support in the prior art '' for the change in structure . In re Grabiak , 769 F.2d 729 , 731-32 ( Fed.Cir.1985 ) . As we noted in Takeda : _NEWLINE_ A known compound may suggest its homolog , analog , or isomer because such compounds often have similar properties and therefore chemists of ordinary skill would ordinarily contemplate making them to try to obtain compounds with *996 improved properties ... . [ However , ] it remains necessary to identify some reason that would have led a chemist to modify a known compound in a particular manner to establish prima facie obviousness of a new claimed compound . _NEWLINE_ 492 F.3d at 1356-57 ( citation omitted ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ At trial , P & G 's expert witnesses testified that , in 1985 , a person having ordinary skill in the art realized that the properties of bisphosphonates could not be anticipated based on their structure . Additionally , the trial court relied on contemporaneous writings from Herbert Fleisch , the preeminent authority on bisphosphonates during the relevant time period . Dr. Fleisch wrote in 1984 that `` every compound , while remaining a bisphosphonate , exhibits its own physical-chemical , biological and therapeutic characteristics , so that each bisphosphonate has to be considered on its own . To infer from one compound the effects in another is dangerous and can be misleading . '' Herbert Fleisch , Chemistry and Mechanisms of Action of Bisphosphonates , in Bone Resorption , Metastasis , and Diphosphonates 33-40 ( S. Garattini ed. , 1985 ) . In this case , P & G synthesized and tested 2-pyr EHDP , risedronate ( 3-pyr EHDP ) and 4-pyr EHDP , another structural isomer . Confirming the unpredictability of bisphosphonates , test results for 4-pyr EHDP revealed that it was not active in inhibiting bone resorption despite its close relationship with potent compounds . In light of the Supreme Court 's instruction in KSR , the Federal Circuit has stated that , `` [ t ] o the extent an art is unpredictable , as the chemical arts often are , KSR 's focus on [ ] 'identified , predictable solutions ' may present a difficult hurdle because potential solutions are less likely to be genuinely predictable . '' Eisai , 533 F.3d 1353 , 1359 ( quoting KSR , 127 S.Ct . at 1742 ) . The district court found that Teva failed to clear that hurdle , establishing insufficient motivation for a person of ordinary skill to synthesize and test risedronate . This finding was not clearly erroneous . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Additionally , there was an insufficient showing that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have had a `` reasonable expectation of success '' in synthesizing and testing risedronate . PharmaStem , 491 F.3d at 1360 . In KSR , the Supreme Court stated that when an obvious modification `` leads to the anticipated success , '' the invention is likely the product of ordinary skill and is obvious under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 . 127 S.Ct . at 1742 . `` [ O ] bviousness can not be avoided simply by a showing of some degree of unpredictability in the art so long as there was a reasonable probability of success . '' Pfizer , 480 F.3d at 1364 ( citing In re Corkill , 771 F.2d 1496 , 1500 ( Fed.Cir.1985 ) ) . Here , the district court 's findings indicate that there was no reasonable expectation in 1985 that risedronate would be a successful compound . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Cases following KSR have considered whether a given molecular modification would have been carried out as part of routine testing . See , e.g. , Takeda , 492 F.3d at 1360 ( discussing the district court 's finding that a modification was not known to be beneficial and was not considered `` routine '' ) . When a person of ordinary skill is faced with `` a finite number of identified , predictable solutions '' to a problem and pursues `` the known options within his or her technical grasp , '' the resulting discovery `` is likely the product not of innovation but of ordinary skill and common sense . '' KSR , 127 S.Ct . at 1742 . So too , `` [ g ] ranting patent protection to advances that would occur in the ordinary course without real innovation retards progress . '' Id . at 1741 . In other cases , though , researchers can only `` vary all parameters or try each of numerous possible choices until *997 one possibly arrive [ s ] at a successful result , where the prior art [ gives ] either no indication of which parameters [ are ] critical or no direction as to which of many possible choices is likely to be successful . '' In re O'Farrell , 853 F.2d 894 , 903 ( Fed.Cir.1988 ) . In such cases , `` courts should not succumb to hindsight claims of obviousness . '' In re Kubin , 561 F.3d 1351 ( Fed.Cir.2009 ) . Similarly , patents are not barred just because it was obvious `` to explore a new technology or general approach that seemed to be a promising field of experimentation , where the prior art gave only general guidance as to the particular form of the claimed invention or how to achieve it . '' In re O'Farrell , 853 F.2d at 903 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In this case , there is no credible evidence that the structural modification was routine . The district court found that the appellee 's expert was evasive on this topic , stating that the witness `` did not directly respond to most questions posed to him about whether it would be common for a chemist who develops a pyridine compound to conceive of and make [ 2-pyr EHDP , 3-pyr EHDP , and 4-pyr EHDP ] isomers . '' Procter & Gamble , 536 F.Supp.2d at 486 . But evidence of evasion is not necessarily evidence that the testimony would otherwise have been favorable . The only direct evidence that the structural modification was routine was presented by an expert witness that the district court judge discredited.1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Accordingly , we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that Teva had not established a prima facie case of obviousness as to the challenged claims of the ¡¬122 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ V. Unexpected Results _NEWLINE_ The district court found that , even if Teva could establish a prima facie case of obviousness , P & G had introduced sufficient evidence of unexpected results to rebut such a showing . Such evidence included `` test data showing that the claimed composition [ ] possess [ es ] unexpectedly improved properties or properties that the prior art does not have . '' In re Dillon , 919 F.2d 688 , 692-93 ( Fed.Cir.1990 ) . Because Teva did not establish a prima facie case of obviousness , P & G need not rely on this evidence to defend the ¡¬122 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Nonetheless , we note that P & G 's witnesses consistently testified that the properties of risedronate were not expected . For example , Dr. Benedict testified that he and other researchers did not predict the potency of risedronate . Ms. McOsker testified that she was `` very surprised '' by the low dose at which risedronate was effective . Dr. Miller stated that the superior properties of risedronate were unexpected and could not have been predicted . In a test to determine the lowest dose at which these compounds caused toxic reactions , risedronate outperformed 2-pyr EHDP by a substantial margin . Risedronate showed no observable toxic effect at a dose of 0.75 mg P/kg/day , while 2-pyr EHDP 's `` no observable effect level '' was only 0.25 mg P/kg/day . In another test involving live animals , 2-pyr EHDP was lethal at a dose of 1.0 mg P/kg/day while risedronate was *998 not . Ultimately , the district court weighed the evidence and evaluated the credibility of the witnesses in concluding that P & G had introduced sufficient evidence of unexpected results to rebut any finding of obviousness . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ VI . Secondary Considerations of Non-Obviousness _NEWLINE_ Secondary considerations of non-obviousness include the commercial success of the invention at issue and its satisfaction of a long-felt need . B.F. Goodrich Co. v. Aircraft Braking Sys . Corp. , 72 F.3d 1577 , 1582 ( Fed.Cir.1996 ) . The district court found that secondary considerations supported a finding of non-obviousness . When present , such factors `` may often be the most probative and cogent evidence [ of non-obviousness ] in the record . '' Stratoflex , Inc. v. Aeroquip Corp. , 713 F.2d 1530 , 1538 ( Fed.Cir.1983 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court found that risedronate , marketed as Actonel , has been an undisputed commercial success and satisfied a long-felt unmet need.2 This conclusion was based on the testimony of Dr. Daniel C. Smith , who stated that risedronate experienced favorable growth and had amassed $ 2.7 billion in aggregate domestic sales . The district court based its finding of a long-felt unmet need on the fact that , in the mid-1980s , osteoporosis was recognized as a serious disease and existing treatments were inadequate . However , because the competing drug alendronate was available before risedronate , Teva contends that risedronate could not have satisfied any unmet need . Teva argues that the long-felt need must be unmet at the time the invention becomes available on the market , when it can actually satisfy that need . To support this argument , Teva cites Monarch Knitting Mach . Corp. v. Sulzer Morat GmbH , 139 F.3d 877 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) . In fact , Monarch rejects a similar argument partly because the competing inventions were not actually produced until after the claimed invention 's filing date . Id . at 884 . Here , alendronate was not produced until ten years after the filing of the ¡¬122 patent . Under Monarch , we look to the filing date of the challenged invention to assess the presence of a long-felt and unmet need . Accordingly , it was not clear error for the district court to conclude that risedronate met such a need and that secondary considerations supported a finding of non-obviousness . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ VII . Whether the ¡¬406 Patent is Prior Art _NEWLINE_ As an alternative to its position that risedronate was not obvious , P & G argues that the ¡¬406 patent should not be considered prior art with respect to the ¡¬122 patent because risedronate was first synthesized by P & G before the ¡¬406 patent was filed . At trial , Dr. Benedict , one of the inventors named in the ¡¬122 patent , testified that he synthesized risedronate in May 1985 . P & G submitted a portion of Dr. Benedict 's laboratory notebook which contains a May 3 , 1985 entry detailing the structure of risedronate and the procedure for its synthesis , but this entry was unwitnessed and was not corroborated by any other evidence . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *999 `` It is well established that when a party seeks to prove conception via the oral testimony of a putative inventor , the party must proffer evidence corroborating that testimony . '' Shu-Hui Chen v. Bouchard , 347 F.3d 1299 , 1309 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) . The inventor `` must provide independent corroborating evidence in addition to his own statements and documents . '' Hahn v. Wong , 892 F.2d 1028 , 1032 ( Fed.Cir.1989 ) . Because P & G did not provide adequate corroborating evidence of an earlier invention date for risedronate , the district court correctly concluded that the ¡¬406 patent qualifies as prior art for purposes of this inquiry . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ VIII . Obviousness-Type Double Patenting _NEWLINE_ In addition to its obviousness defense , Teva also asserted that the ¡¬122 patent was invalid for double patenting . The double patenting doctrine is designed to prevent a patent owner from extending his exclusive rights to an invention through claims in a later-filed patent that are not patentably distinct from claims in the earlier filed patent . Geneva Pharm. , Inc. v. GlaxoSmithKline PLC , 349 F.3d 1373 , 1378 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) In general , the obviousness analysis applies to double patenting , except for three distinctions . First , statutory obviousness compares claimed subject matter to the prior art , while non-statutory double patenting compares claims in an earlier patent to claims in a later patent or application . Id . at 1377 n. 1 . Second , double patenting does not require inquiry into a motivation to modify the prior art . Id . Finally , double patenting does not require inquiry into objective criteria suggesting non-obviousness . Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Having concluded that risedronate was not obvious under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 , we similarly conclude that the ¡¬122 patent is not invalid for obviousness-type double patenting . Additionally , we agree with the district court that the claims of the ¡¬122 patent are distinct from the claims of the ¡¬406 patent . Comparing the claims of the ¡¬122 patent to those of the ¡¬406 patent , we note that , while claims 4 and 16 of the ¡¬122 patent explicitly claim the risedronate compound , the ¡¬406 patent claims an intermittent dosing regimen for the treatment of osteoporosis and claims no new compounds . Accordingly , Teva failed to present clear and convincing evidence of overlap between the claims of the two patents to invalidate the ¡¬122 patent based on obviousness-type double patenting . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ III . CONCLUSION _NEWLINE_ For the foregoing reasons , we affirm . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ AFFIRMED _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 566 F.3d 989 , 90 U.S.P.Q.2d 1947 _NEWLINE_ Footnotes _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ * _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Honorable Marilyn L. Huff , District Judge , United States District Court for the Southern District of california , sitting by designation . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Appellant 's expert testified that `` if someone was aware that [ 2-pyr EHDP ] was safe and effective , they would immediately in terms of the drug discovery effort , make the [ 3-pyr EHDP ] . '' However , the district court concluded that this witness `` had no specialized experience in the area of bisphosphonates '' aside from his preparation to testify in the litigation . Procter & Gamble , 536 F.Supp.2d at 480 . Additionally , the expert prepared his opinion by reviewing drug profiles in the current version of the Physician 's Desk Reference instead of drug profiles from the relevant time , causing his opinions to be `` marred by hindsight . '' Id . at 495 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 2 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The court rightly gave little weight to risedronate 's commercial success because the prior art ¡¬406 patent was also assigned to P & G. As of December 6 , 1985 , the filing date of the ¡¬122 patent , 2-pyr EHDP could be found only in a pending application for the ¡¬406 patent , which was not available to the public . See Merck & Co. , Inc. v. Teva Pharma . USA , Inc. , 395 F.3d 1364 , 1377 ( Fed.Cir.2005 ) ( holding that commercial success is not significantly probative of non-obviousness where others are barred from acting on the prior art ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_

Glenmark appeals the United States District Court for the District of Delaware 's final judgment entered in favor of Intendis GmbH , Intraserv GmbH & Co. KG , and Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc. ( collectively , `` Appellees '' ) . For the reasons set forth below , we affirm . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1359 BACKGROUND _NEWLINE_ Appellee Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc. holds approved New Drug Application ( `` NDA '' ) No . 21470 for Finacea ( r ) Gel , which contains azelaic acid as the therapeutically active ingredient in a concentration of 15 % by weight and is indicated for the topical treatment of inflammatory papules and pustules of mild to moderate rosacea . Finacea ( r ) Gel 's inactive ingredients , known as excipients , include triglycerides and lecithin . Finacea ( r ) Gel is manufactured in the form of a `` hydrogel , '' which the district court construed to mean `` a semisolid dosage form that contains water and a gelling agent to form a gel , which may contain dispersed particles and/or insoluble liquids . '' Intendis GmbH v. Glenmark Pharm . Ltd. , 117 F.Supp.3d 549 , 567-68 ( D.Del.2015 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Food and Drug Administration 's ( `` FDA '' ) Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluation , commonly known as the Orange Book , lists U.S. Patent No . 6,534,070 ( `` the ¡¬070 patent '' ) as covering Finacea ( r ) Gel . The ¡¬070 patent , entitled `` Composition with Azelaic Acid , '' is assigned to Appellee Intraserv GmbH & Co. and exclusively licensed to Appellee Intendis GmbH . The patent issued in March 2003 and claims priority to a provisional application filed on February 12 , 1998 . Sole independent claim 1 of the ¡¬ 070 patent recites : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 . A composition that comprises : _NEWLINE_ ( i ) azelaic acid as a therapeutically active ingredient in a concentration of 5 to 20 % by weight , _NEWLINE_ ( iii ) at least one triacylglyceride3 in a concentration of 0.5 to 5 % by weight , _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ( iv ) propylene glycol , and _NEWLINE_ ( v ) at least one polysorbate , in an aqueous phase that further comprises water and salts , and the composition further comprises _NEWLINE_ ( ii ) at least one polyacrylic acid , and _NEWLINE_ ( vi ) lecithin , _NEWLINE_ wherein the composition is in the form of a hydrogel . _NEWLINE_ ¡¬070 patent , col. 6 , lines 28-39 ( emphases added ) . _NEWLINE_ Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd. submitted an Abbreviated New Drug Application ( `` ANDA '' ) to the FDA seeking to market a generic version of Finacea ( r ) Gel . The submission included a paragraph IV certification pursuant to 21 U.S.C . ¡± 355 ( j ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ( vii ) ( IV ) asserting that the ¡¬070 patent is invalid and not infringed . Unlike Finacea ( r ) Gel , the proposed generic product substituted isopropyl myristate for the claimed triglyceride and lecithin . Pursuant to 21 U.S.C . ¡± 355 ( j ) ( 2 ) ( B ) ( ii ) , Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Inc. , USA informed Appellees that an ANDA had been filed . In response , Appellees filed a complaint against Glenmark in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware , alleging that Glenmark 's submission of the ANDA infringed the ¡¬ 070 patent under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 271 ( e ) ( 2 ) ( A ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court held a Markman hearing on January 21 , 2015 , and a five-day bench trial from February 5-11 , 2015 on the issues of infringement and validity . On July 27 , 2015 , the district court issued an opinion concluding that claims 1-12 of the ¡¬070 patent were infringed under the doctrine of equivalents and not invalid . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ With respect to infringement , the central dispute was whether isopropyl myristate *1360 in Glenmark 's generic product met the claim elements triglyceride and lecithin under the doctrine of equivalents . The district court found that it did , relying on the function-way-result test . The district court rejected Glenmark 's arguments that infringement under the doctrine of equivalents ( i ) would encompass the prior art and ( ii ) was barred by prosecution history estoppel . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ With respect to validity , the district court found that none of the prior art references raised by Glenmark disclosed every element of independent claim 1 and rejected Glenmark 's argument that the claims would have been obvious . Prior to Finacea ( r ) Gel , Bayer marketed and sold a topical 20 % azelaic acid cream known as Skinoren ( r ) , which is prior art to the ¡¬070 patent . The district court agreed with Glenmark that a person of ordinary skill in the art would pursue a hydrogel formulation of azelaic acid because the Skinoren ( r ) formulation had undesirable qualities such as phase separation of the emulsion , whitening effect , and spreadability problems . However , the district court determined that Glenmark failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that a person of ordinary skill would have been motivated to combine the prior art references in a manner that would render claim 1 of the ¡¬070 patent obvious . It determined that even if Glenmark had , Glenmark failed to show a reasonable expectation of success in making such combination . Finally , the district court found that the objective indicia of nonobviousness , namely , unexpected results of the claimed formulations and commercial success of Finacea ( r ) Gel , weighed in favor of nonobviousness . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On August 14 , 2015 , the district court entered a final judgment in favor of Appellees and directed the FDA not to approve Glenmark 's ANDA until after the November 18 , 2018 , expiration of the ¡¬070 patent . This appeal followed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ DISCUSSION _NEWLINE_ On appeal , Glenmark argues that ( i ) the district court erred in its application of the function prong of the function-way-result test for infringement under the doctrine of equivalents , ( ii ) infringement under the doctrine of equivalents would encompass the prior art , ( iii ) Appellees expressly disavowed and disclaimed a formulation without lecithin , and ( iv ) the district court erred in its obviousness analysis . We address each argument in turn . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I . Infringement Under the Doctrine of Equivalents _NEWLINE_ Infringement under the doctrine of equivalents is a question of fact that we review for clear error following a bench trial . Allergan , Inc. v. Sandoz Inc. , 796 F.3d 1293 , 1311 ( Fed.Cir.2015 ) . Even when an accused product does not meet each and every claim element literally , it may nevertheless be found to infringe the claim `` if there is 'equivalence ' between the elements of the accused product or process and the claimed elements of the patented invention . '' Warner-Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chem . Co. , 520 U.S. 17 , 21 , 117 S.Ct . 1040 , 137 L.Ed.2d 146 ( 1997 ) ( quoting Graver Tank & Mfg . Co. v. Linde Air Prods . Co. , 339 U.S. 605 , 609 , 70 S.Ct . 854 , 94 L.Ed . 1097 ( 1950 ) ) . One way to show equivalence is by showing on an element-by-element basis that `` the accused product performs substantially the same function in substantially the same way with substantially the same result as each claim limitation of the patented product , '' often referred to as the function-way-result test . Crown Packaging Tech. , Inc. v. Rexam *1361 Beverage Can Co. , 559 F.3d 1308 , 1312 ( Fed.Cir.2009 ) . Each prong of the function-way-result test is a factual determination . In this case , neither party objects to employing the function-way-result test as a means to determine equivalency of these chemical compounds . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Glenmark 's argument on appeal is limited to the district court 's determination that Glenmark 's isopropyl myristate performed substantially the same function as the claimed triglyceride and lecithin . We review the district court 's determination that they perform substantially the same function , a question of fact , for clear error . Biovail Corp. Int ' l v. Andrx Pharm. , Inc. , 239 F.3d 1297 , 1300 ( Fed.Cir.2001 ) . To be clear , we are not presented with the issue of the substantiality of the differences between the chemical structures of isopropyl myristate , triglyceride , and lecithin . This appeal is limited to whether the district court clearly erred when it determined that triglyceride and lecithin function as penetration enhancers in the claimed compounds . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Glenmark 's non-infringement argument was based on the claim elements triglyceride and lecithin ( collectively , `` claimed excipients '' ) , which are recited in the sole independent claim 1 . Even though Glenmark 's generic product did not physically contain triglyceride or lecithin , the district court found that the claimed excipients were met under the doctrine of equivalents . First , the court found that isopropyl myristate in Glenmark 's generic product ( `` Glenmark 's excipient '' ) performs substantially the same function as the claimed excipients-namely , enhancing azelaic acid 's penetration of the skin . It reasoned that several experts testified that the claimed excipients could act as penetration enhancers and that `` nothing in the record '' indicated they could not . It also reasoned that Glenmark 's ANDA included repeated statements that both Glenmark 's excipient and the claimed excipients function as penetration enhancers . It noted that Glenmark `` should not be permitted to liken their product to the claimed composition to support their bid for FDA approval , yet avoid the consequences of such a comparison for purposes of infringement . '' Intendis , 117 F.Supp.3d at 573 . Second , the court found that Glenmark 's excipient performed in substantially the same way as the claimed excipients-namely , by disrupting the lipids in the skin 's outermost layer , known as the stratum corneum . It based its finding on testimony by various experts , as supported by scientific literature . Third , the court found that Glenmark 's excipient obtained substantially the same result as the claimed excipients-namely , a therapeutically effective azelaic acid composition that is able to penetrate the skin in order to deliver the active ingredient . It relied on data from the ¡¬070 patent , Glenmark 's own patent application , a skin penetration study , and a clinical trial . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On appeal , Glenmark argues that the district court erred in its finding regarding the function prong because Appellees failed to prove that the claimed excipients function as penetration enhancers in the claimed composition . It argues that `` [ t ] he ¡¬070 patent itself is silent on the question of whether lecithins or triglycerides function as penetration enhancers . '' Intendis , 117 F.Supp.3d at 572 . According to Glenmark , this absence of support in the patent itself for the notion that the claimed excipients function as penetration enhancers is fatal to Appellees ' infringement case . Glenmark argues that Appellees ' theory is also contradicted by evidence outside the *1362 patent . It points to Appellees ' FDA filings and development reports as such examples , which identified the claimed lecithin and triglyceride as an emulsifier and an emollient , respectively . It argues that not a single literature reference in evidence identified lecithin or triglyceride as a penetration enhancer , and Appellees ' expert testimony was rejected by the district court . According to Glenmark , the district court justified its finding that the claimed excipients function as penetration enhancers on the basis that the evidence did not exclude that possibility , despite the lack of any affirmative evidence . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We see no clear error in the district court 's finding of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents . As an initial matter , we disagree that the lack of disclosure of the claimed excipients as penetration enhancers in the ¡¬070 patent is fatal to Appellees ' infringement case . We have never held that a patent must spell out a claim element 's function , way , and result in order for the doctrine of equivalents to apply as to that element . To the contrary , we have held that `` [ w ] hen the claims and specification of a patent are silent as to the result of a claim limitation , ... we should turn to the ordinary skilled artisan . '' Stumbo v. Eastman Outdoors , Inc. , 508 F.3d 1358 , 1365 ( Fed.Cir.2007 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Certainly , a patent 's disclosure is relevant and can at times be dispositive of the function . Glenmark is correct that the proper analysis focuses on the claimed element 's function in the claimed composition , not a function that element could perform in the abstract divorced from the claimed composition . But Glenmark is wrong to the extent that it argues that a determination of the claimed element 's function is limited to a review of the intrinsic record . The relevant inquiry is what the claim element 's function in the claimed composition is to one of skill in the art , and a fact finder may rely on extrinsic evidence in making this factual determination . Zenith Labs. , Inc. v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. , 19 F.3d 1418 , 1425 ( Fed.Cir.1994 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Glenmark argues that the district court erred in its determination that the claimed excipients function as penetration enhancers in light of the evidence of record . We see no clear error in this district court fact finding . Fatal to Glenmark 's argument is its own ANDA submission to the FDA repeatedly referring to the claimed excipients ( triglyceride and lecithin ) as penetration enhancers . For example , Glenmark stated in its filing to the FDA that `` [ i ] sopropyl myristate was selected as [ a ] penetration enhancer instead of lecithin and medium chain triglyceride '' under the heading `` Selection of penetration enhancer . '' J.A . 5865 . Glenmark 's repeated statements to the FDA that the claimed excipients function as penetration enhancers tend to show that one of skill in the art would understand the claimed excipients to function as penetration enhancers . We see no reason why a district court acting as a fact finder should ignore a party 's representation to a federal regulatory body that is directly on point . Based on this record , the district court 's finding regarding the function of the claimed excipients is not clearly erroneous . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In a strange turn of events , Glenmark argued at oral argument to this court that its statements in its FDA submissions about the claimed excipients ( triglyceride and lecithin ) functioning as penetration enhancers should be rejected and can not be evidence to support the district court 's finding . It argued that `` lecithin and triglycerides are not known to the art as *1363 penetration enhancers '' and that its representation to the FDA that they do function as penetration enhancers was a `` guess '' and `` wrong . '' Oral Argument at 10:49-13:38 , Intendis GmbH v. Glenmark Pharm. , Inc. , No.2015-1902 ( Fed.Cir . Jan. 8 , 2016 ) , available at http : //oralarguments.cafc.uscourts.gov/default.aspx ? fl=2015-1902.mp3 . These seemingly extemporaneous arguments do not persuade us that there is clear error in the district court 's decision that isopropyl myristate in Glenmark 's generic product and the claimed triglyceride and lecithin perform substantially the same function . No such arguments were made by Glenmark in any of its briefing to this court . And when asked whether Glenmark had notified the FDA of these purported inaccurate representations to the FDA , Glenmark 's counsel was unaware of such notification . Id . at 11:53-12:25 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court did not clearly err in its findings regarding the doctrine of equivalents . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ II . Encompassing the Prior Art _NEWLINE_ A patentee may not assert `` a scope of equivalency that would encompass , or ensnare , the prior art . '' DePuy Spine , Inc. v. Medtronic Sofamor Danek , Inc. , 567 F.3d 1314 , 1322 ( Fed.Cir.2009 ) ( quotation marks omitted ) . Even if an accused element meets the function-way-result test , no equivalent will be found if the scope of equivalency would capture the prior art . Hypothetical claim analysis is a practical method to determine whether an equivalent would impermissibly ensnare the prior art . See Ultra-Tex Surfaces , Inc. v. Hill Bros. Chem . Co. , 204 F.3d 1360 , 1364 ( Fed.Cir.2000 ) . Hypothetical claim analysis is a two-step process . The first step is `` to construct a hypothetical claim that literally covers the accused device . '' DePuy Spine , 567 F.3d at 1324 . Next , prior art introduced by the accused infringer is assessed to `` determine whether the patentee has carried its burden of persuading the court that the hypothetical claim is patentable over the prior art . '' Id . at 1325 . In short , we ask if a hypothetical claim can be crafted , which contains both the literal claim scope and the accused device , without ensnaring the prior art . We review a district court 's conclusion that a hypothetical claim does not encompass the prior art de novo and resolution of underlying factual issues for clear error . Id . at 1324 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court determined that a proper hypothetical claim included the claimed excipients and Glenmark 's excipient , namely , the hypothetical claim includes isopropyl myristate as an alternative to the claimed triglyceride and lecithin . Glenmark argued that finding infringement under the doctrine of equivalents would ensnare a prior art reference entitled `` In vitro permeation of azelaic acid from viscosized microemulsions '' ( `` Gasco '' ) , which disclosed a microemulsion containing azelaic acid as the active ingredient and DMSO as a penetration enhancer . The parties agreed that Gasco did not disclose isopropyl myristate , lecithin , or triglyceride . The district court determined that the hypothetical claim was not anticipated or rendered obvious by Gasco , and rejected Glenmark 's argument that finding infringement under the doctrine of equivalents would ensnare Gasco . It reasoned , based on expert testimony , that a skilled artisan ( i ) would not necessarily have substituted the hypothetical claim excipient ( isopropyl myristate or lecithin and triglyceride ) for Gasco 's DMSO , and ( ii ) would not have had a *1364 reasonable expectation of success in doing so . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Glenmark argues that the district court erred in determining that the doctrine of equivalents was not precluded by ensnarement . It argues that the district court 's hypothetical claim was `` inexplicably narrower '' than Appellees ' range of equivalents . It argues that a proper hypothetical claim should have matched Appellees ' theory of infringement and thus included any penetration enhancer . It argues that a proper hypothetical claim would have been anticipated by or obvious over the prior art and thus the doctrine of equivalents should be precluded . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We agree with the district court 's determination that its infringement finding under the doctrine of equivalents did not impermissibly read on the prior art . Hypothetical claims extend the actual claim to literally recite the accused product . The district court adopted a proper hypothetical claim , one that includes triglycerides and lecithin or alternatively isopropyl myristate . It correctly rejected as too broad Glenmark 's proposed hypothetical claim which would cover all penetration enhancers . The district court 's infringement finding was that the excipient in Glenmark 's product ( isopropyl myristate ) was equivalent to the claimed excipients ( lecithin and triglycerides ) ; it was not a finding that any penetration enhancer would be equivalent to the claimed excipients . See Graver Tank & Mfg . Co. v. Linde Air Prods . Co. , 339 U.S. 605 , 609 , 70 S.Ct . 854 , 94 L.Ed . 1097 ( 1950 ) ( `` What constitutes equivalency must be determined against the context of the patent , the prior art , and the particular circumstances of the case ... . In determining equivalents , things equal to the same thing may not be equal to each other and , by the same token , things for most purposes different may sometimes be equivalents. '' ) . The district court properly rejected Glenmark 's argument that the hypothetical claim must be constructed to capture all penetration enhancers . Glenmark does not challenge the district court 's determination that the hypothetical claim as constructed would have been patentable . Thus , we see no reversible error in the district court 's conclusion that Gasco does not bar the application of the doctrine of equivalents to find Glenmark 's generic version to infringe the asserted claims . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ III . Prosecution History Estoppel _NEWLINE_ We have summarized the doctrine of prosecution history estoppel as follows : _NEWLINE_ [ P ] rosecution history estoppel limits the broad application of the doctrine of equivalents by barring an equivalents argument for subject matter relinquished when a patent claim is narrowed during prosecution . We have recognized that prosecution history estoppel can occur during prosecution in one of two ways , either ( 1 ) by making a narrowing amendment to the claim ( `` amendment-based estoppel '' ) or ( 2 ) by surrendering claim scope through argument to the patent examiner ( `` argument-based estoppel '' ) . _NEWLINE_ Conoco , Inc. v. Energy & Envtl . Int ' l , L.C. , 460 F.3d 1349 , 1363 ( Fed.Cir.2006 ) ( citations omitted ) . With respect to the amendment-based estoppel , the Supreme Court has explained : _NEWLINE_ A patentee 's decision to narrow his claims through amendment may be presumed to be a general disclaimer of the territory between the original claim and the amended claim . There are some *1365 cases , however , where the amendment can not reasonably be viewed as surrendering a particular equivalent . The equivalent may have been unforeseeable at the time of the application ; the rationale underlying the amendment may bear no more than a tangential relation to the equivalent in question ; or there may be some other reason suggesting that the patentee could not reasonably be expected to have described the insubstantial substitute in question . In those cases the patentee can overcome the presumption that prosecution history estoppel bars a finding of equivalence . _NEWLINE_ Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co. , Ltd. , 535 U.S. 722 , 740-41 , 122 S.Ct . 1831 , 152 L.Ed.2d 944 ( 2002 ) . We review de novo issues relating to the application of prosecution history estoppel . Schwarz Pharma , Inc. v. Paddock Labs. , Inc. , 504 F.3d 1371 , 1375 ( Fed.Cir.2007 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court rejected Glenmark 's argument that the ¡¬070 patent applicants surrendered a lecithin-free composition ( e.g. , Glenmark 's proposed generic product ) as an equivalent during prosecution . During prosecution , the examiner noted that two dependent claims , which recited a lecithin `` concentration of up to 1 % '' and `` concentration of up to 3 % , '' respectively , could include zero lecithin . Applicants responded that those range limitations clearly did not include zero because they `` are only in claims dependent on independent claims , which clearly require [ lecithin ] . '' J.A . 4386-87 ( noting that the examiner 's argument `` is not well taken. '' ) . Regardless , applicants amended the two dependent claims to recite a lecithin `` concentration of from more than 0 to 1 % '' and `` concentration of from more than 0 to 3 % , '' respectively , noting that they were `` amended to expressly state what has already been made clear on the record . '' The district court determined that `` taken in context , '' the amendments were for clarification purposes , `` not to disclaim formulations with zero lecithin . '' It noted that Glenmark did not dispute that independent claim 1 always required lecithin , and consequently , both dependent claims also always required lecithin . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Glenmark argues that the district court erred in determining that prosecution history estoppel did not apply to bar the doctrine of equivalents . It argues that applicants expressly disavowed and disclaimed formulations without lecithin . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We see no error in the district court 's analysis . The district court correctly determined that prosecution history estoppel did not preclude the capture of Glenmark 's lecithin-free composition as an equivalent . Argument-based estoppel only applies when the prosecution history `` evince [ s ] a clear and unmistakable surrender of subject matter . '' Deering Precision Instruments , LLC v. Vector Distrib . Sys. , Inc. , 347 F.3d 1314 , 1326 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) ( citation and punctuation omitted ) . Applicants ' clarifying statement , `` Since the dependent claims must limit the independent claims , the meaning is clear that zero amounts are not included , '' J.A . 4387 , did not clearly and unmistakably disavow claim scope to distinguish prior art . Amendment-based estoppel does not apply because the amendment was not a narrowing amendment made to obtain the patent . Rather , this record demonstrates that the amendment to the dependent claims was a clarifying amendment . As dependent claims can never be broader than the independent claim from which they depend , the dependent claims as originally written could not have included 0 % lecithin . The amendment was , as the comments themselves *1366 make clear , a clarifying amendment and it does not give rise to prosecution history estoppel . We see no error in the district court 's determination that prosecution history estoppel does not apply . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ IV . Obviousness _NEWLINE_ The district court determined that the asserted claims would not have been obvious over the previously-marketed Skinoren ( r ) cream in combination with ( i ) references disclosing formulations containing the claimed excipients ( `` non-azelaic acid art '' ) , and ( ii ) references disclosing formulations containing azelaic acid ( `` azelaic acid art '' ) .4 Skinoren ( r ) cream contained 20 % azelaic acid and was marketed for skin conditions . The district court found that Skinoren ( r ) 's formulation had certain undesirable qualities , and that a skilled artisan would consider developing an alternative to Skinoren ( r ) in a different dosage form given the market forces and the deficiencies of Skinoren ( r ) . It also found that a skilled artisan would have been motivated to pursue a hydrogel formulation of azelaic acid based on Maru , one of the pieces of azelaic acid art , which the district court found to disclose a hydrogel formulation containing azelaic acid . It found , however , that the record did not show that the artisan would have been motivated to use the claimed excipients ( triglyceride and lecithin ) . It noted that Glenmark 's only support to combine Maru with either of the two references that disclose the claimed excipients was the testimony by Glenmark 's expert that a skilled artisan `` could have put ... information together from another two publications '' to render claim 1 obvious . It reasoned that this cursory statement was insufficient to meet Glenmark 's burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence a motivation to combine Maru with other prior art to render the claims obvious . It also found that even if Glenmark had presented evidence to show motivation to combine , Glenmark failed to carry its burden to demonstrate a reasonable expectation of success in making the combination . It found-based on fact and expert testimony-that `` swapping ingredients in complex chemical formulations is anything but 'routine . ' `` J.A . 65 . It wrote that Glenmark did not present testimony or other evidence regarding an expectation of success . It also determined that the objective indicia of unexpected results and commercial success supported its conclusion of nonobviousness . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Glenmark argues that the district court erred in concluding that the asserted claims would not have been obvious . It argues that a skilled artisan would have known how to `` successfully '' combine the non-azelaic acid art with the azelaic acid art . It argues that the objective indicia do not overcome its `` strong '' prima facie case of obviousness . According to Glenmark , the district court erred in finding that the claimed compositions demonstrated unexpected results . It also argues Appellees ' `` equivocal '' evidence concerning commercial success does not support the district court 's nonobviousness conclusion . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court correctly concluded that the asserted claims would not have been obvious . We discern no clear error in the district court 's finding that a skilled artisan would not have been motivated to combine the prior art or in finding no reasonable expectation of success based on *1367 the evidence of record . Moreover , we see no clear error in the district court 's findings with respect to objective indicia of nonobviousness . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ CONCLUSION _NEWLINE_ The district court did a commendable job in rendering its detailed and thorough opinion . Because we see no reversible error in the district court 's decision that Glenmark 's generic product infringed the asserted claims and that the asserted claims are not invalid , the district court 's judgment is affirmed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ AFFIRMED _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ COSTS _NEWLINE_ Costs to the Appellees . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 822 F.3d 1355 , 119 U.S.P.Q.2d 1200 _NEWLINE_ Footnotes _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Hatch-Waxman Act is the name commonly used to refer to the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 , Pub.L .

The United States District Court for the District of Delaware , Leonard P. Stark , J. , 891 F.Supp.2d 588 , ruled that the patents were not invalid as obvious , and defendant appealed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Court of Appeals , Prost , Circuit Judge , held that the patents , which taught use of active ingredient at 0.3 % concentration , were invalid as obvious in light of prior art that disclosed preferred range of 0.01 % -1 % for that ingredient , with same inactive ingredients . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Reversed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Newman , Circuit Judge , filed dissenting opinion . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Attorneys and Law Firms _NEWLINE_ *734 Charles E.

( collectively , `` Galderma '' ) are not invalid under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 . We find that the district court erred in finding the claims of the asserted patents not invalid as obvious . Accordingly , we reverse . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I . BACKGROUND _NEWLINE_ This Hatch-Waxman case is based on Tolmar 's filing of an Abbreviated New Drug Application ( `` ANDA '' ) seeking approval to market a generic version of Differin ( r ) Gel , 0.3 % , which is a topical medication containing 0.3 % by weight adapalene approved for the treatment of acne . On January 21 , 2010 , Galderma sued Tolmar in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware , alleging that Tolmar 's ANDA product infringed certain claims of the ¡¬377 patent . Galderma subsequently filed amended complaints alleging infringement of each of the asserted patents . After a bench trial , the district court ruled against Tolmar on several issues of which only invalidity under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 is at issue in this appeal . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A. Patented Technology _NEWLINE_ The asserted patents include both composition claims and claims directed to methods of treating acne using pharmaceutical compositions . At trial , Galderma alleged infringement of claims 35 and 36 of the ¡¬181 patent , claims 24 and 27 of the ¡¬060 patent , claim 5 of the ¡¬558 patent , and claims 40 and 41 of the ¡¬044 patent.1 Each of the asserted claims requires an aqueous gel or cream that includes 0.3 % by weight of adapalene . The asserted claims also recite one or more inactive excipients included in the gel or cream . Claim 5 of the ¡¬558 patent is representative : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 5 . A topically applicable pharmaceutical composition comprising 0.3 % by weight of [ adapalene ] relative to the total weight of the composition , effective for the treatment of acne , formulated into a topically applicable , pharmaceutically acceptable medium therefor , said composition being in the form of a topically applicable , pharmaceutically acceptable aqueous gel comprising at least one carbomer gelling agent and wherein the sole anti-acne ingredient is adapalene . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B . Prior Art _NEWLINE_ Below , Tolmar based its obviousness argument primarily on three pieces of prior art : U.S. Patent No . 4,717,720 ( `` Shroot ¡¬720 patent '' ) , U.S. *735 Reissue No . 34,440 ( `` Shroot ¡¬440 patent '' ) , and the Differin ( r ) 0.1 % Gel Data Sheet ( `` Data Sheet '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Shroot ¡¬720 patent specifically discloses and claims adapalene along with other inventive compounds . Col. 3 ll . 9-10 ; col. 4 ll . 29-37 ; col. 9 ll . 39-54 ; col. 19 l.17-col. 20 l. 19 . Four of the seven composition examples in the Shroot ¡¬720 patent disclose adapalene as the active ingredient , in concentrations of 0.001 % , 0.1 % , and 1 % . Col. 16 ll . 35-53 ; col. 17 ll . 20-52 . The specification of the Shroot ¡¬720 patent states repeatedly that the inventive compounds are useful for the treatment of acne . See col. 4 ll . 53-59 ; see also col. 5 ll . 49-53 . Moreover , the specification states that the inventive compounds can be used in concentrations `` preferably between 0.01 and 1 weight percent , based on the total weight of the composition . '' Shroot ¡¬ 720 patent col. 5 ll . 61-64 . Finally , the Shroot ¡¬720 patent indicates that the inventive compounds `` are less irritating than known retinoids of analogous structure . '' Col. 4 ll . 48-51 . The Shroot ¡¬440 patent is largely similar to the Shroot ¡¬720 patent , but also contains claim 4 , which recites a preferred range of 0.01 to 1 % for cosmetic compositions which include the inventive compounds , e.g. , adapalene , as the active ingredient . Shroot ¡¬440 patent col. 20 ll . 15-18 . Notably , prior to their expiration , the Shroot patents were listed in the FDA 's Orange Book as covering Galderma 's prior art Differin ( r ) 0.1 % Gel as well as Differin ( r ) Gel , 0.3 % . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Data Sheet is the product insert for Galderma 's earlier launched adapalene product . The Data Sheet discloses 0.1 % adapalene as a treatment for acne . It also discloses all but one of the inactive ingredients listed in the asserted claims . Other than the dosage of adapalene , the only difference between the claimed formulations and the formulation taught by the Data Sheet is that the Data Sheet discloses `` poloxamer 182 , '' while certain asserted claims list `` poloxamer 124 . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In addition to the Shroot patents and the Data Sheet , Tolmar provided other relevant evidence . For instance , a 1989 article by Jamoulle et al . describes the use of a lotion containing 0.3 % adapalene in an animal model to determine whether adapalene was suitable for the treatment of acne . The authors concluded from this test that adapalene was `` particularly suitable for the treatment of acne . '' J.A . 13063 . A series of other prior art articles demonstrate that 0.03 % and 0.1 % adapalene products were effective against acne and well tolerated . These articles include : Verschoore et al. , Efficacy and Safety of CD 271 Alcoholic Gels in the Topical Treatment of Acne Vulgaris , 124 British J. of Derm . 368-71 ( 1991 ) ( `` Verschoore 1991 '' ) ; Alirezai et al. , Comparative Study of the Effectiveness and Tolerance of 0.1 and 0.03 Percent Adapalene Gels and of a 0.025 Percent Tretinoin Gel in the Treatment of Acne , 123 Ann .

S119-25 ( 1997 ) ( `` Allec 1997 '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The prior art also teaches the use of 0.3 % adapalene for other conditions without intolerable irritability . See Verschoore et al. , Adapalene 0.1 % Gel Has Low Skin Irritation Potential , 36 ( 6 ) J . Am . Acad . of Dermatol . S104-09 ( 1997 ) ( `` Verschoore 1997 '' ) ; Goldfarb , Using Adapalene to Treat Photodamage , Supp . to Skin & Aging 4-7 ( Nov.2000 ) ( `` Goldfarb Article '' ) ; Goldfarb et al. , Photographic Assessment of the Effects of Adapalene 0.1 % and 0.3 % Gels and Vehicle on Photodamage Skin , 14 ( Supp.1 ) J.

Bershad et al. , Topical Retinoids in the Treatment of Acne Vulgaris , 64 ( Supp.2 ) Cutaneous Med . for the Practitioner 8-19 ( Aug.1999 ) ( `` Bershad 1999 '' ) . Finally , the prior art indicated that many skilled artisans believed at the time of the invention that 0.1 % was the optimal concentration of adapalene for the treatment of acne . See Verschoore 1997 ; Allec 1997 ; Czernielewski et al. , Adapalene Biochemistry and the Evolution of a New Topical Retinoid for Treatment of Acne , 15 ( Supp.3 ) J. Eur . Acad . Dermatol . Venerol . 5-12 ( 2001 ) ( `` Czernielewski 2001 '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ II . OBVIOUSNESS _NEWLINE_ The determination of invalidity for reasons of obviousness under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 is a legal conclusion based on underlying facts . Graham v. John Deere Co. , 383 U.S. 1 , 17 , 86 S.Ct . 684 , 15 L.Ed.2d 545 ( 1966 ) . Following a bench trial , we `` review the district court 's factual findings for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo . '' Winner Int ' l Royalty Corp. v. Wang , 202 F.3d 1340 , 1344-45 ( Fed.Cir.2000 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Factual considerations that underlie the obviousness inquiry include the scope and content of the prior art , the differences between the prior art and the claimed invention , the level of ordinary skill in the art , and any relevant secondary considerations . See Graham , 383 U.S. at 17-18 , 86 S.Ct . 684 . Relevant secondary considerations include commercial success , long-felt but unsolved needs , failure of others , and unexpected results . KSR Int ' l Co. v. Teleflex Inc. , 550 U.S. 398 , 406 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 , 167 L.Ed.2d 705 ( 2007 ) ; In re Soni , 54 F.3d 746 , 750 ( Fed.Cir.1995 ) . Because patents are presumed valid , Tolmar was required to prove that the asserted claims were obvious by clear and convincing evidence . See Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. P'ship , -- - U.S. -- -- , 131 S.Ct . 2238 , 2242 , 180 L.Ed.2d 131 ( 2011 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Tolmar presents an obviousness case that is both straightforward and potent . At the time of the invention , adapalene was a known compound and the prior art Shroot patents disclose topical adapalene compositions for the purpose of treating acne in a preferred range of 0.01 % -1 % , including several exemplary formulations containing adapalene in various concentrations . The asserted claims are directed to 0.3 % topical adapalene compositions for the treatment of acne , which fall within the concentration range disclosed in the Shroot patents . Thus , the Shroot patents disclose all of the limitations of the asserted claims , except for a precise teaching of 0.3 % adapalene and the specific inactive ingredients of the asserted claims . The specific inactive ingredients of the asserted claims are , however , taught by the Data Sheet . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Data Sheet discloses each of the inactive ingredients , except for poloxamer 124 . However , the district court found poloxamer 124 equivalent to poloxamer 182 , which is disclosed in the Data Sheet . Moreover , the district court held that `` the record evidence establishes that the inactive ingredients in the claimed formulations [ were ] routine and obvious , and , therefore , non-inventive . '' *737 Galderma Labs. , L.P. v. Tolmar , Inc. , 891 F.Supp.2d 588 , 645 ( D.Del.2012 ) . Notably , on appeal , the parties do not dispute the obviousness of the inactive ingredients of the formulation . Rather , the sole dispute between the parties is whether it was obvious to use a 0.3 % adapalene composition for the treatment of acne . Accordingly , Tolmar argues that the asserted claims are obvious because they claim nothing more than the use of an old compound for a known purpose in a concentration that falls within a range disclosed in the prior art as preferred for that purpose . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Tolmar buttresses its obviousness argument with other relevant evidence . This evidence includes a study that used a lotion containing 0.3 % adapalene in an animal model to determine that adapalene was `` particularly suitable for the treatment of acne . '' J.A . 13063 . Additionally , the prior art showed that 0.03 % and 0.1 % adapalene products were suitable for the treatment of acne and that 0.3 % adapalene products were suitable for the treatment of other conditions without intolerable irritability . Moreover , the prior art indicated that dermatologists desired acne treatments that came in varying concentrations . According to Tolmar , this provides further motivation to select a 0.3 % adapalene composition for the treatment of acne . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court rejected Tolmar 's obviousness case , finding that Tolmar `` failed to establish , by clear and convincing evidence , that the claimed inventions would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill at the time of the invention . '' Galderma Labs. , 891 F.Supp.2d at 637 . In reaching this conclusion , the district court relied heavily on evidence showing that increasing the dose of adapalene was likely to increase the incidence of certain side effects and evidence showing that 0.1 % was considered the optimal adapalene concentration for the treatment of acne . Id . at 641-42 . In addition , the court found `` that at least two secondary considerations , unexpected results and commercial success , additionally support the determination that the asserted claims are not invalid due to obviousness . '' Id . at 642-44 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Prior to addressing the obviousness of the asserted claims , we note an error in the district court 's obviousness analysis . The district court framed the obviousness inquiry as requiring Tolmar to provide motivation in the prior art to triple the concentration of adapalene from 0.1 % to 0.3 % . Id . at 638 . Tolmar carried no such burden . Rather , Tolmar , like all those who seek to prove claims obvious , was required to show that `` the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art are such that the claimed invention as a whole would have been obvious before the effective filing date of the claimed invention to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which the claimed invention pertains . '' 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 . Nothing in the statute or our case law requires Tolmar to prove obviousness by starting with a prior art commercial embodiment and then providing motivation to alter that commercial embodiment . See KSR , 550 U.S. at 419 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 ( `` In determining whether the subject matter of a patent claim is obvious , neither the particular motivation nor the avowed purpose of the patentee controls . What matters is the objective reach of the claim . If the claim extends to what is obvious , it is invalid under ¡± 103. '' ) . This is particularly true where , as here , the prior art teaches a range that encompasses both the prior art commercial embodiment and the claimed invention . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The relevant dispute in this case is thus not over whether the prior art discloses all of the claim elements or over the motivation to combine the prior art references . Rather , the dispute is whether there was motivation to select the claimed 0.3 % adapalene composition in the disclosed *738 range . In these circumstances , where there is a range disclosed in the prior art , and the claimed invention falls within that range , the burden of production falls upon the patentee to come forward with evidence that ( 1 ) the prior art taught away from the claimed invention ; ( 2 ) there were new and unexpected results relative to the prior art ; or ( 3 ) there are other pertinent secondary considerations . See Novo Nordisk A/S v. Caraco Pharm . Labs. , Ltd. , 719 F.3d 1346 , 1352-54 ( Fed.Cir.2013 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Accordingly , Tolmar having demonstrated that the prior art taught a range of concentrations of adapalene for the treatment of acne that encompasses the claimed 0.3 % adapalene composition , we now examine the district court 's findings with respect to the factors listed above to determine whether the claims are invalid as obvious . The ultimate burden of proving obviousness rests with Tolmar . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A . Teaching Away _NEWLINE_ Despite express teachings in the Shroot patents indicating that adapalene would be useful in concentrations preferably between 0.01 % and 1 % , the district court found that the prior art taught away from a 0.3 % adapalene composition . The district court based its conclusion primarily on two related grounds.3 First , according to the district court , the prior art taught `` away from the selection of 0.3 % adapalene for the treatment of acne , because of dose-dependent increases in side effects . '' Galderma Labs. , 891 F.Supp.2d at 641 n. 8 . And second , the prior art taught that 0.1 % was the optimal concentration of adapalene for the treatment of acne . Id . at 641-42 . We leave undisturbed the district court 's findings that increasing the dose of adapalene would result in a concomitant increase in side effects and that 0.1 % was the optimal concentration of adapalene for the treatment of acne at the time of the invention . However , to the extent the court found that these facts taught away from the claimed invention , it clearly erred . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A reference may be said to teach away when a person of ordinary skill , upon reading the reference , would be discouraged from following the path set out in the reference , or would be led in a direction divergent from the path that was taken by the applicant . A reference does not teach away , however , if it merely expresses a general preference for an alternative invention but does not criticize , discredit , or otherwise discourage investigation into the invention claimed . _NEWLINE_ DePuy Spine , Inc. v. Medtronic Sofamor Danek , Inc. , 567 F.3d 1314 , 1327 ( Fed.Cir.2009 ) . With respect to the prior art teachings of dose-dependent side effects , the district court relied on the Verschoore 1991 and Alirezai 1996 articles , which show that the increase in adapalene concentration from 0.03 % to 0.1 % resulted in an increase in side effects . Neither of these articles mentions 0.3 % adapalene compositions , nor do they expressly teach away from the claimed invention . The district court inferred that these references taught away from a further tripling of the adapalene concentration . We can not agree with this inference . _NEWLINE_ These articles show increased side effects associated with 0.1 % adapalene as *739 compared to 0.03 % adapalene , yet they failed to discourage even the use of 0.1 % adapalene . To the contrary , as the district court found , 0.1 % was the optimal concentration of adapalene at the time of the invention . Galderma Labs. , 891 F.Supp.2d at 641-42 . Moreover , there is nothing in either of these references to indicate that increasing the concentration to 0.3 % would be unproductive , nor do these articles indicate in any way that the side effects would be serious enough to dissuade the development of a 0.3 % adapalene product . Therefore , the Verschoore 1991 and Alirezai 1996 articles fail to teach away from the claimed invention . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court relied on the Allec 1997 , Verschoore 1997 , and Czernielewski 2001 articles to demonstrate that 0.1 % was the standard or optimal concentration of adapalene for the treatment of acne . The court concluded that this fact teaches away from 0.3 % adapalene compositions . It does not . `` A reference does not teach away ... if it ... does not 'criticize , discredit , or otherwise discourage ' investigation into the invention claimed . '' DePuy Spine , 567 F.3d at 1327 ( citing In re Fulton , 391 F.3d 1195 , 1201 ( Fed.Cir.2004 ) ) . A teaching that a composition may be optimal or standard does not criticize , discredit , or otherwise discourage investigation into other compositions . Accordingly , the Allec 1997 , Verschoore 1997 , and Czernielewski 2001 articles do not teach away from the claimed invention . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B . Unexpected Results _NEWLINE_ The district court found that the comparable tolerability of 0.1 % and 0.3 % adapalene was unexpected in view of the prior art , since a skilled artisan would have expected that tripling the concentration of adapalene would have resulted in a clinically significant increase in side effects . Galderma Labs. , 891 F.Supp.2d at 642-44 . While we agree that this result was unexpected , it does not constitute an unexpected result that is probative of nonobviousness . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Unexpected results that are probative of nonobviousness are those that are `` different in kind and not merely in degree from the results of the prior art . '' Iron Grip Barbell Co. v. USA Sports , Inc. , 392 F.3d 1317 , 1322 ( Fed.Cir.2004 ) ( citation omitted ) . Results which differ by percentages are differences in degree rather than kind , where the modification of the percentage is within the capabilities of one skilled in the art at the time . See In re Harris , 409 F.3d 1339 , 1344 ( Fed.Cir.2005 ) ( finding increased efficacy , measured by percentages , to be a difference of degree and not of kind ) ; In re Budde , 50 C.C.P.A . 1491 , 319 F.2d 242 , 246 ( 1963 ) ( finding no unexpected results where ranges of reaction time and temperature constituted only a difference in degree rather than in kind ) ; In re Aller , 42 C.C.P.A . 824 , 220 F.2d 454 , 456-57 ( 1955 ) ( finding no unexpected results where improved yields over the prior art , measured by percentages , reflect a difference in degree , not in kind ) . Thus , where an unexpected increase in efficacy is measured by a small percentage , as here , and the evidence indicates that skilled artisans were capable of adjusting the percentage , the result constitutes a difference in degree , not kind . So too , where an increase by a percentage is expected but not found , that result is also likely only a difference in degree . In this case , the expected result was an increase , by some percentage , in the prevalence of certain side effects . The failure of that percent increase to materialize , though unexpected , constitutes only a difference in degree from the prior art results . Accordingly , the comparable tolerability of 0.1 % and 0.3 % adapalene does not indicate that the asserted claims are non-obvious . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *740 C. Commercial Success _NEWLINE_ `` Evidence of commercial success ... is only significant if there is a nexus between the claimed invention and the commercial success . '' Ormco Corp. v. Align Tech. , Inc. , 463 F.3d 1299 , 1311-12 ( Fed.Cir.2006 ) . `` When a patentee can demonstrate commercial success , usually shown by significant sales in a relevant market , and that the successful product is the invention disclosed and claimed in the patent , it is presumed that the commercial success is due to the patented invention . '' J.T . Eaton & Co. v. Atlantic Paste & Glue Co. , 106 F.3d 1563 , 1571 ( Fed.Cir.1997 ) . However , `` if the feature that creates the commercial success was known in the prior art , the success is not pertinent . '' Ormco Corp. , 463 F.3d at 1311-12 ; see also J.T . Eaton , 106 F.3d at 1571 ( `` [ T ] he asserted commercial success of the product must be due to the merits of the claimed invention beyond what was readily available in the prior art '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court found that `` [ t ] he commercial success of Galderma 's 0.3 % adapalene product also supports a finding of nonobviousness . '' Galderma Labs. , 891 F.Supp.2d at 644 . The district court gave two reasons for its finding . First , Differin ( r ) 0.3 % , Galderma 's commercial embodiment of the claims , `` quickly gained and maintained market share-even in the face of an overall declining market and decreasing promotional expenditures , and while facing competition from generic 0.1 % adapalene formulations . '' Id . Second , the court found `` that Tolmar ( along with another ANDA filer , Actavis ) seeks to enter the market precisely because Differin ( r ) 0.3 % has been commercially successful . '' Id . We discuss these findings in reverse order . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The mere fact that generic pharmaceutical companies seek approval to market a generic version of a drug , without more , is not evidence of commercial success that speaks to the non-obviousness of patent claims . Plainly , Tolmar believes that it can make a profit selling a generic version of the claimed invention . This is likely true in all Hatch-Waxman cases , if not all patent cases generally . However , that fact tells us very little about the level of commercial success of the patented invention relative to the prior art or the extent to which the commercial success of the branded drug is `` due to the merits of the claimed invention beyond what was readily available in the prior art . '' J.T . Eaton , 106 F.3d at 1571 . As such , it does not support a finding of non-obviousness . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The court also relied on the fact that Differin ( r ) Gel , 0.3 % quickly gained and maintained market share to find commercial success . We do not disturb this finding . However , we note that it is of limited value in determining whether or not the presently asserted claims are obvious . `` Commercial success is relevant because the law presumes an idea would successfully have been brought to market sooner , in response to market forces , had the idea been obvious to persons skilled in the art . '' Merck & Co. v. Teva Pharm . USA , Inc. , 395 F.3d 1364 , 1376 ( Fed.Cir.2005 ) . Where `` market entry by others was precluded [ due to blocking patents ] , the inference of non-obviousness of [ the asserted claims ] , from evidence of commercial success , is weak . '' Id . at 1377 . This principle applies forcefully to the present case . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The now expired Shroot patents blocked the market entry of 0.3 % adapalene products until their expiration in 2010 , long after Galderma invented 0.3 % adapalene compositions of the asserted claims . As such , no entity other than Galderma could have successfully brought to 0.3 % to market prior to 2010 . Like the commercial *741 success described in Merck & Co. , the commercial success of Differin ( r ) Gel , 0.3 % is of `` minimal probative value . '' Id . at 1376 . Accordingly , we conclude the district court erred in adjudging this factor as confirming its conclusion of nonobviousness . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ III . CONCLUSION _NEWLINE_ For the foregoing reasons , we hold that claims 35 and 36 of the ¡¬181 patent , claims 24 and 27 of the ¡¬060 patent , claim 5 of the ¡¬558 patent , and claims 40 and 41 of the ¡¬044 patent are invalid as obvious . We therefore reverse the district court 's finding that the claims are valid . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ REVERSED _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ NEWMAN , Circuit Judge , dissenting . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Without doubt , the question of obviousness here presented is a close call . However , when the question is close , when it turns on findings and interpretations of biologic and medicinal evidence , when the application of law to fact invokes the policy of the patent statute to advance the useful arts , then the findings and rulings of the trial court warrant particular attention on appellate review . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Here , the district court fully explored the evidence relating to whether it would have been obvious to increase by 300 % the concentration of the active ingredient adapalene without increasing its known adverse side effects . The district judge held an eight-day bench trial , heard thirteen live witnesses including expert witnesses of stature and experience , and received evidence and argument from both sides . The court issued an opinion with over 50 pages on the issue of obviousness , finding the facts and weighing the evidence and applying the law with thoughtful explanation and reasoning.1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ My colleagues on this panel give scant attention to the district court 's analysis , instead making their own findings , and applying flawed procedural and substantive law . My colleagues do not identify clear error in the district court 's findings ; instead they distort the burdens of proof and production , ignore the applicable standard of proof and rely on their own factual determinations and creative theories of law , and eradicate the patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court ruled that there was not clear and convincing evidence of invalidity . By contrast , my colleagues announce their rule whereby a broad teaching that includes the patented invention removes the statutory presumption of validity , and without more establishes obviousness . See maj. op . at 737-38 ( `` where there is a range disclosed in the prior art , and the claimed invention falls within that range , the burden of production falls upon the patentee ... '' ) . Although the majority mentions the requirement of clear and convincing evidence of invalidity , the majority presumes that the prior art establishes invalidity , and places on the patentee the burden of establishing patentability based on `` secondary considerations . '' The majority goes on to impose a new and unprecedented view of these considerations . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ For example , although the panel majority concedes that there are unexpected results for the concentration selected by the patentee , see maj. op . at 739 ( `` we agree that this result was unexpected '' ) , my colleagues do not require the patent challenger to show any reason in the prior art ( or common sense ) for selection of this embodiment with its unexpected properties . Rather , they hold that unless a skilled artisan was not `` capable of adjusting the percentage , '' id. , the extent of the change in percentage ( here 300 % ) and the unexpected *742 results and properties are irrelevant to patentability . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In refusing to credit any of the demonstrated `` secondary considerations '' my colleagues foreclose patentability to a vast body of improvement patents . In the field of medicaments , the denial of patentability for improvements is a disincentive to the development of such improvements . The losers are those afflicted with disease . I respectfully dissent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ DISCUSSION _NEWLINE_ Particularly for close questions of patentability , the district court 's findings and assessments of credibility and weight of evidence , and the district court 's application of law to found facts , compel appellate attention . The role of the trial court in considering the evidence that each party provides through examination and cross-examination of witnesses and documents , with judicial elaboration and interaction , can not be matched on appeal . As the Supreme Court stated in Anderson v. Bessemer City , `` duplication of the trial judge 's efforts in the court of appeals would very likely contribute only negligibly to the accuracy of fact determination at a huge cost in diversion of judicial resources . '' 470 U.S. 564 , 574-75 , 105 S.Ct . 1504 , 84 L.Ed.2d 518 ( 1985 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Clear and convincing evidence is required to overcome the statutory presumption of validity of a duly granted patent . See 35 U.S.C . ¡± 282 ( a patent is presumed valid ) ; Cardinal Chem . Co. v. Morton Int ' l , 508 U.S. 83 , 93 n. 15 , 113 S.Ct . 1967 , 124 L.Ed.2d 1 ( 1993 ) ( invalidity must be proved by clear and convincing evidence ) . Here the panel majority does not provide clear and convincing evidence of invalidity . Instead , the majority discards the trial judge 's findings on the premise of a presumption of invalidity that the majority applies to `` selection '' inventions , that is , inventions within a known class or range of technology , for which the majority discards the established procedural and substantive burdens . The majority makes its own factual findings , and writes new law . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In contrast to the panel majority 's dismissive analysis , the district court 's findings reflect careful examination of all of the evidence . Nonetheless , my colleagues conclude that the selection of a 300 % increase in dosage was obvious , after the unexpected properties of the increase were discovered by this patentee . I summarize some of the evidence before the district court , whose findings well support the conclusion that invalidity on the ground of obviousness was not established by clear and convincing evidence : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ THE PRIOR ART _NEWLINE_ In this Hatch-Waxman case , Tolmar , Inc. seeks to invalidate Galderma 's patents on the commercially successful acne medication whose active ingredient is the retinoid adapalene in 0.3 % concentration . There was extensive prior art showing retinoids including adapalene in a range of concentrations for various uses , and showing the prior selection of 0.1 % adapalene for treatment of acne because higher concentrations were shown to be unduly irritative to acne-ridden skin . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court found that the knowledge in the field taught away from the 0.3 % concentration , based on the expert testimony and documentary evidence at trial . The district court , applying the correct standard , held that Tolmar did not prove invalidity by clear and convincing evidence . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *743 The Shroot Patents ( 1988 , 1992 , 1993 ) 2 _NEWLINE_ These are Galderma 's now-expired patents on benzonaphthalene derivatives including adapalene , and their use to treat acne . The issue is the selection of the 0.3 % adapalene concentration in the patents-in-suit . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court found that `` the [ Shroot ] range of 0.0005 % to 5 % for topical compositions covers four orders of magnitude ( or a 10,000-fold dosage range ) '' and that `` even the 'preferred ' range of 0.01 % to 1 % is a hundredfold dosage range . '' DCt . Op . at 609 . The district court found that `` [ f ] rom this large genus of potential treatments , Galderma selected 0.1 % adapalene as the concentration of adapalene with which to begin development of a topical treatment for acne . '' Id . at 603 . Dr. Shroot testified that the 0.1 % dosage was considered the optimal dose for tolerance in a rabbit irritation study . Tr . at 1841:12-17 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court found that `` [ t ] he broad disclosure of the Shroot patents provides no motivation or suggestion to select 0.3 % adapalene for the treatment of acne . '' Id . at 608-09 . The correctness of these findings is not challenged by the panel majority . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Verschoore article ( 1991 ) 3 _NEWLINE_ Verschoore ( 1991 ) discusses a Phase II clinical trial where 0.03 % and 0.1 % adapalene formulations , along with 0.025 % tretinoin ( a retinoid previously approved for topical use ) were tested on the faces of patients with acne . The test data showed that the 0.1 % adapalene formulation caused increased irritation compared to the 0.03 % formulation . DCt . Op . at 604 . Galderma 's expert testified that persons of ordinary skill in this art would view these data as suggesting that `` a significant increase in tolerability measures '' would result from a further tripling of the adapalene dose from 0.1 % to 0.3 % . Tr . at 1230:15-20 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court found , supported by the expert testimony , that `` [ t ] he results of this study suggest that increasing the concentration of adapalene beyond 0.1 % would result in significantly increased irritation . '' DCt . Op . at 604 . My colleagues disagree with what they call the district court 's `` inference '' that Verschoore ( 1991 ) and Alirezai ( 1996 ) ( see infra ) taught away from a further tripling of the dose . Thus my colleagues replace the testamentary and documentary expertise that supports the district court 's findings , with the expertise of the panel majority . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Alirezai article ( 1996 ) 4 _NEWLINE_ The district court found that `` the trend of increased irritation between the 0.03 % and 0.1 % dosages disclosed in Verschoore ( 1991 ) was later confirmed in the same dosages in aqueous gels in a publication by Alirezai et al . entitled 'Comparative Study of the Effectiveness and Tolerance of 0.1 and 0.03 Percent Adapalene Gels and of 0.025 Percent Tretinoin Gel in the Treatment of Acne . ' `` DCt . Op . at 604 . The district court found that this article disclosed that `` severe burning was seen in no patients treated with the 0.03 % adapalene , but was seen in 13 % of patients treated with the 0.1 % adapalene aqueous gel '' and that `` significantly higher levels of 'average ' *744 burning and itching after application were observed with the 0.1 % formulation as compared to the 0.03 % formulation . '' Id . at 605 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court found that `` [ t ] his study , conducted on the faces of acne patients , demonstrates that the tolerability of the 0.1 % dosage was different than the 0.03 % dosage . '' Id . The correctness of this finding is not challenged by my colleagues . In concluding that Alirezai ( 1996 ) does not teach away from the claimed invention , my colleagues ignore the district court 's finding that significantly higher levels of burning and itching were observed upon increasing the adapalene concentration of the formulation . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Allec article ( 1997 ) 5 _NEWLINE_ This article , entitled `` Skin Distribution and Pharmaceutical Aspects of Adapalene Gel , '' is discussed by the district court as `` describ [ ing ] the results of in vivo models used to select the optimal concentration of adapalene for efficacy and safety ... '' . DCt . Op . at 605 ( emphasis in original ) . The article concludes that `` [ b ] ased on these in vivo results , 0.1 % was considered as the optimal concentration of drug for adapalene gel . This choice was subsequently confirmed in clinical trials of safety and efficacy . '' Id . at 606 , quoting Allec ( 1997 ) at S123 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court found that `` [ a ] person of ordinary skill in the art would have recognized these statements as a conclusion of the company that developed adapalene had determined , from all the data it had on hand , that 0.1 % was the optimal concentration for acne treatment , balancing efficacy and safety . '' Id . at 606 . My colleagues concede , citing Allec ( 1997 ) , that `` the prior art indicated that many skilled artisans believed at the time of invention that 0.1 % was the optimal concentration of adapalene for the treatment of acne . '' Maj. op . at 742-43 . My colleagues do not explain the grounds for their belief contrary to that of `` many skilled artisans . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Verschoore article ( 1997 ) 6 _NEWLINE_ This article describes Phase I clinical trials conducted by Galderma on healthy subjects . The article states : _NEWLINE_ We carried out 13 different controlled , randomized , intraindividual comparison phase I studies in 339 healthy human volunteers to investigate the cutaneous safety of adapalene [ ] . The irritation potential of adapalene 0.03 % , 0.1 % , and 0.3 % gels was found to be low , whether tested under occlusive or nonocclusive conditions on a variety of sites ( face , chest , back , and buttocks ) . _NEWLINE_ Verschoore ( 1997 ) at S104 . At the trial Tolmar stressed the testing by Verschoore of the 0.3 % formulation . The district court found that `` [ t ] he Phase I irritation test described in Verschoore ( 1997 ) was a screening test done on uncompromised healthy skin on the back as a prelude-not a substitute-to clinical testing on the face or on patients with disease ... . A skilled person would understand that data from these Phase I studies conducted on healthy skin can not be extrapolated to how the product will work in acne patients . '' DCt . Op . at 610 . The district court found that `` Verschoore ( 1997 ) demonstrates that Galderma decided to pursue and obtain clinical approval for 0.1 % adapalene . Further the mention of the 0.3 % concentration in the article demonstrates to one skilled in the art that the 0.3 % adapalene was *745 tried and rejected as the dosage to pursue for further clinical testing . '' Id . at 606-07 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court received testimony from experts on both sides . Galderma 's expert testified that a skilled person would know that patch testing on the backs of healthy volunteers is a `` poor predictor '' of the irritation experienced by facial skin damaged by acne . Tr . at 1244:19-1245:6 . Tolmar 's expert had previously written7 that this type of irritation test `` had failed to predict adverse reactions to skin damaged by acne or shaving , on sensitive areas such as the face . '' DCt . Op . at 610 ( emphasis in original ) . Although Tolmar 's expert stated a different opinion at trial , the district court found that the witness did not refute the views he had previously published on the non-predictive nature of patch tests on the backs of healthy individuals . Id . at 622 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ These district court findings are not challenged by my colleagues . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Czernielewski article ( 2001 ) 8 _NEWLINE_ This article summarizes the results of adapalene studies including those reported in Alirezai ( 1996 ) and Verschoore ( 1997 ) . The article explains that the `` primary objective in the development of adapalene was to create a topical agent with retinoid therapeutic effects that is considerably less irritating than topical tretinoin . '' DCt . Op . at 640 . The court states : `` Adapalene 0.1 % became the standard concentration for subsequent adapalene formulations . '' Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court found that `` [ t ] he Czernielewski article suggests that 0.1 % adapalene is the optimal dose for the treatment of acne , '' and that the article `` does not disclose any information about any doses higher than 0.1 % adapalene . '' DCt . Op . at 607 . My colleagues do not challenge the district court 's findings that the prior art , including Czernielewski ( 2001 ) , shows that 0.1 % was believed to be the optimal adapalene dose . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Goldfarb article ( 2000 ) 9 _NEWLINE_ This article describes a study of the treatment of photodamaged skin with 0.1 % and 0.3 % adapalene formulations . The authors describe both of these adapalene concentrations as being `` tolerated well . '' DCt . Op . at 613 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court again received evidence and testimony from experts for both sides . Galderma 's expert explained the differences between photodamaged skin and skin with acne , and the different patient populations . Tr . at 1290:1-1293:1 . The district court found that publications by Tolmar 's expert showed that `` one of ordinary skill in the art would understand older skin with photodamage and actinic keratosis to be less sensitive to the retinoid reaction compared to younger skin with acne . '' Id . The expert 's contrary testimony at trial did not refute his prior published statements . Credibility findings are the particular province of the trial judge . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court found that the results of this study `` are not predictive of how the same drug would affect patients with acne . One of ordinary skill in the art would know *746 that these results on photodamaged skin should not be extrapolated to acne . '' Id . Without either acknowledging or disputing this finding , my colleagues cite Goldfarb as teaching that 0.3 % adapalene can be used for `` other conditions '' without intolerable irritability . Maj. op . at 743 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Euvrard article ( 2002 ) 10 _NEWLINE_ Euvrard ( 2002 ) describes a study using 0.1 % and 0.3 % adapalene to treat `` actinic keratosis on the hands and forearms of organ transplant patients who were presumably on immunosuppressive drugs . '' DCt . Op . at 614 . The district court summarized the Euvrard conclusion that `` [ t ] olerance was excellent everywhere '' and `` [ t ] aking into account the good tolerance of adapalene , these results encourage further studies on the use of adapalene at ... higher dosage regimens . '' Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ There was expert testimony from both sides , and the district court found , as with Goldfarb , that `` [ d ] ifferences exist between the properties of facial skin and skin on the extremities , such as the hands and forearms studied in Euvrard . Facial skin , more traditionally afflicted with acne , is much more prone to irritation and often thinner than skin on extremities . '' Id . The district court found that `` [ b ] ased on these differences , one of ordinary skill in the art would not conclude from Euvrard that adapalene 0.3 % gel would result in the same tolerability profile in patients with acne vulgaris . '' Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The correctness of this finding is not disputed by my colleagues . Instead , without acknowledging or correcting the district court 's findings , my colleagues cite Euvrard ( 2002 ) as teaching the use of 0.3 % adapalene for `` other conditions '' without intolerable irritability . However , the issue here is acne vulgaris , not `` other conditions . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Differin 0.1 % Gel Data Sheet ( 1996 ) _NEWLINE_ Differin ( r ) is the trademark for Galderma 's adapalene products . The data sheet for 0.1 % Differin cautioned against `` overdosage , '' stating that : `` If the medication is applied excessively , no more rapid or better results will be obtained and marked redness , peeling , or discomfort may occur . '' DCt . Op . at 607 . Galderma cited the overdosage warning as evidence of teaching away from higher adapalene concentrations . The district court did not appear to give weight to the data sheet , explaining that the warning was required by law . Id . at 642 n. 11 ( citing 21 C.F.R . ¡± 201.56 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Bershad article ( 1999 ) 11 _NEWLINE_ This article describes a `` roundtable '' meeting of dermatologists . Referencing the commercial 0.1 % adapalene product , Bershad ( 1999 ) states that `` [ a ] lthough adapalene is commonly believed to be one of the least irritating topical retinoids , the perception of many dermatologists is that this advantage is at least partially negated by a relatively lower efficacy compared with the other topical retinoids . '' Bershad ( 1999 ) at 11 . The district court did not discuss Bershad , although it is cited by the panel majority . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Tolmar contends that this article provides motivation to increase the concentration of adapalene . Galderma responds that this article does not show any expectation or understanding that the concentration of adapalene could be increased three-fold without the predicted irritating side effects . At trial , Tolmar 's expert *747 opined that this article suggested using doses of adapalene higher than 0.1 % . Tr . at 1301:14-16 . Galderma 's expert disagreed , stating that the authors were merely discussing the characteristics of the various available acne treatments . Tr . at 1301:21-23 . This roundtable discussion does not render obvious the three-fold increase in dosage , when so many publications cautioned against the increased irritability of higher dosages . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Jamoulle article ( 1989 ) 12 _NEWLINE_ This article describes a study involving the application of a formulation containing 0.3 % adapalene to hairless rats . The district court did not discuss this article . The panel majority states that Jamoulle ( 1989 ) teaches the use of 0.3 % adapalene to treat acne . Maj. op . at 742 . However , results in hairless rats were not shown to establish dosage and tolerance on human skin , much less skin sensitized by acne . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ II _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ THE `` SECONDARY CONSIDERATIONS '' _NEWLINE_ Commercial Success _NEWLINE_ The district court found that despite late entry into a crowded market for treatment of acne , Galderma 's Differin ( r ) 0.3 % gel quickly gained and maintained market share , despite an overall declining market . The district court agreed with Galderma that Tolmar seeks to sell the 0.3 % formulation precisely because that formulation is preferred by consumers over the 0.1 % formulation . The court found that the availability of cheaper generic 0.1 % adapalene after the expiration of the Shroot patents did not appear to have affected consumer demand for the Differin ( r ) 0.3 % product , whose market share and revenue were not explained by promotional activity , which had actually decreased . Clear error has not been shown in these findings . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ My colleagues discount the factor of commercial success , arguing that the entry of 0.3 % adapalene products , by Tolmar or others , had previously been blocked by the Shroot patents . Maj. op . at 740 . However , the evidence in the district court was that the 0.3 % product was successful against the 0.1 % product and other acne medications . The district court did not err in including evidence of commercial success in its evaluation of the question of obviousness . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Teaching Away _NEWLINE_ The district court found , based on the prior art and the expert testimony presented by both sides , that the evidence as a whole taught away from increasing the concentration of adapalene above 0.1 % . The district court found that `` [ t ] he increased irritation observed in [ Verschoore ( 1991 ) and Alirezai ( 1996 ) ] when tripling the concentration of adapalene from 0.03 % to 0.1 % effectively taught away from again tripling the concentration from 0.1 % to 0.3 % , given the potential for increased side effects . '' DCt . Op . at 641-42 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court also found that Allec ( 1997 ) , Verschoore ( 1997 ) and Czernielewski ( 2001 ) `` would also have taught away from tripling the concentration of adapalene from 0.1 % to 0.3 % , which would have been a significant deviation from the then-understood optimal concentration . '' DCt . Op . at 642 . The court found that the experience of those skilled with other topical retinoids that had been approved for human use , such as tretinoin and tazarotene , further taught away from tripling of the concentration of adapalene . The court *748 explained that both tretinoin and tazarotene faced tolerability problems which required the manufacturers to decrease their concentration in products for the treatment of acne . Clear error has not been shown in these findings . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Unexpected Results _NEWLINE_ The district court found that it was unexpected that the tolerability profile of 0.3 % adapalene was not statistically different from that of 0.1 % adapalene . Tolmar had argued-and repeats on appeal-that at most the tolerability profile of 0.3 % adapalene represents a difference in degree , not in kind . However , based on expert testimony from both sides , the district court found that `` [ w ] hereas the prior art suggested a dose-dependent , clinically meaningful increase in side effects would result from increasing the concentration of adapalene from 0.03 % to 0.1 % , the claimed inventions achieved a difference in kind by discontinuing that trend . '' Id . at 643 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court explained that differences in degree occur when the invention is merely a continuation of a trend previously described in the prior art . Id . at n. 14 ( citing In re Huang , 100 F.3d 135 ( Fed.Cir.1996 ) ; Iron Grip Barbell Co. , Inc. v. USA Sports , Inc. , 392 F.3d 1317 , 1323 ( Fed.Cir.2004 ) ) . Here , the prior art showed a trend to increased adverse side effects with increased concentration , while Galderma 's products violated that trend . This was a difference in kind , not in degree . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Clear error has not been shown in these findings , all of which are discounted or ignored by the panel majority . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ III _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ THE DECISION AT TRIAL _NEWLINE_ The district court considered all of the evidence and argument , and concluded that the claims to the 0.3 % adapalene formulations had not been proved invalid by clear and convincing evidence . The court acknowledged Tolmar 's argument that obviousness should be presumed : Tolmar argued that `` because 0.3 % adapalene falls within the 0.01 % -1.0 % range previously disclosed in Galderma 's Shroot patents the claimed inventions are prima facie obvious , '' and that `` 'evidence of secondary considerations simply can not overcome the presumption ' of obviousness . '' DCt . Op . at 637 ( quoting Tolmar 's trial brief ) . The district court , unlike the panel majority , correctly recognized that a prima facie showing is not a presumption of obviousness , and does not change the placement of the burden of proof . The district court recited : _NEWLINE_ Recently , the Federal Circuit rejected such an approach to obviousness in the context of litigation . The Federal Circuit noted that the Supreme Court `` has never spoken in terms of a legally rebuttable presumption with respect to obviousness ; '' nor has it provided any `` indication that it believes the burden of persuasion should shift to the patentee at [ any ] point to prove nonobviousness . '' _NEWLINE_ DCt . Op . at 637-638 ( quoting In re Cyclobenzaprine Hydrochloride Litigation , 676 F.3d 1063 , 1078 ( Fed.Cir.2012 ) ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court correctly explained that `` the proper analysis of obviousness under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 requires that 'all evidence relevant to obviousness or nonobviousness be considered , and be considered collectively , ' without resort to presumptions of prima facie obviousness or burden-shifting . '' DCt . Op . at 638 ( quoting Cyclobenzaprine , 676 F.3d at 1078 ) . This is the correct standard , established in Graham v. John Deere and reiterated consistently and exhaustively . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The dispositive findings in this case , viz . the content of the prior art , whether the *749 prior art taught away , whether the invention produced unexpected results , and whether there was commercial success , involve factual inquires that must be accepted on appeal unless clearly erroneous . See In re Applied Materials , Inc. , 692 F.3d 1289 , 1294 ( Fed.Cir.2012 ) ( `` Obviousness is a question of law with several underlying factual inquiries , including what a reference teaches , whether a reference teaches away , and whether there is commercial success . '' ) ( citing Graham v. John Deere Co. of Kan. City , 383 U.S. 1 , 17-18 , 86 S.Ct . 684 , 15 L.Ed.2d 545 ( 1966 ) ) . Clear error has not been shown in the district court 's findings . Instead , on highly selective snippets of the information that was before the district court , my colleagues simply make their own findings . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The burden of overcoming a district court 's factual findings is heavy . See Anderson v. Bessemer City , N.C. , 470 U.S. 564 , 574 , 105 S.Ct . 1504 , 84 L.Ed.2d 518 ( 1985 ) ( `` Where there are two permissible views of the evidence , the factfinder 's choice between them can not not be clearly erroneous. '' ) . Based on the expert testimony , the documentary evidence , and the factual findings of teaching away , unexpected results , and commercial success , the district court concluded that Tolmar failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the inventions of the patents-in-suit would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the field of the inventions . For the reasons discussed by the district court , the judgment requires affirmance . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Tolmar was required to provide clear and convincing evidence that the selection of 0.3 % from within the broad range in the prior art was obvious in view of the entirety of the evidence . The evidence at trial was that the increase in adapalene concentration was viewed skeptically , and that the combination of efficacy and safety of the 0.3 % dose was unexpected to the experts . The experts at trial agreed that the beneficial combination of properties of the 0.3 % dose could not have been predicted in advance-indeed the opposite was predicted . The resultant product was commercially successful despite the cheaper prior product at lower dosage . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The panel majority mentions but does not apply the presumption of validity . My colleagues hold that for inventions `` where there is a range disclosed in the prior art , and the claimed invention falls within that range , '' the burden falls upon the patentee to support patentability . Maj. op . at 744 . This is not just a shift in the burden of production ; the majority never requires that Tolmar meet its burden of persuasion . Instead , once Tolmar had demonstrated that the invention fell within a broad range disclosed in the prior art , according to the panel majority , Tolmar met its evidentiary burden . My colleagues do not require that the prior art provide some reason for selection of the patented embodiment . Instead , the court places the burden of `` rebuttal '' on the patentee , and limits rebuttal to the `` secondary considerations . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The panel majority also makes creative new rules , ruling that patentability is negated `` where the modification of the percentage is within the capabilities of one skilled in the art at the time . '' Maj. op . at 746 . The holding that since `` skilled artisans were capable of adjusting the percentage , '' the product containing 300 % more active ingredient , `` although unexpected '' in properties , id. , is unpatentable , is new and incorrect law . A skilled artisan will nearly always be `` capable '' of adjusting a percentage of an ingredient ; this fact does not render unexpected results not probative of unobviousness . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Thus the court places new obstacles in the path of improvement patents , a change of law that is particularly pernicious in the arts where small differences may have *750 large consequences or benefits . This rule is of further mischief now that the nation has adopted a first-to-file law with its pressures for early filing , possibly before all embodiments have been fully explored . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court applied the correct law to a vast body of evidence , most of which is not discussed by the panel majority . The district court properly applied statute and precedent . From my colleagues ' inappropriate rulings , I respectfully dissent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 737 F.3d 731 , 108 U.S.P.Q.2d 1929 _NEWLINE_ Footnotes _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The ¡¬377 patent was not asserted at trial . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 2 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Euvrard ( 2002 ) appears to have been published in 2000 , not 2002 .

For the sake of consistency , we do the same . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 3 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court also relied on evidence that other commercially available , more irritating , topical retinoids were recently introduced in lower concentrations due to tolerability issues . The district court , however , provided no rationale as to why one of ordinary skill would do the same with adapalene , which is less irritating than other retinoids . Moreover , the higher concentration formulations of the other topical retinoids remained commercially available .

The United States District Court for the Northern District of California , Robert P. Aguilar , J. , granted defendant 's motions for summary judgment based on alleged invalidity of patents , and appeal was taken . The Court of Appeals , Baldwin , Senior Circuit Judge , held that : ( 1 ) presumption of validity attaching to patent , which was finally issued after applicant introduced new evidence to rebut prior finding of prima facie obviousness , carried with it the assumption that new evidence was material , and ( 2 ) patent that was issued for radiation-heated reactor used in chemical vapor deposition did not anticipate later patent issued for chemical vapor deposition process and thereby render it invalid . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Vacated and remanded . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Attorneys and Law Firms _NEWLINE_ *279 Philip P.

Brown , III . _NEWLINE_ Before BISSELL , Circuit Judge , BALDWIN , Senior Circuit Judge , and ARCHER , Circuit Judge . _NEWLINE_ Opinion _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ BALDWIN , Senior Circuit Judge . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This is an appeal by plaintiff Applied Materials , Inc. ( Applied ) from the final *280 judgment of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California granting the motions for summary judgment of defendant Gemini Research Corporation ( Gemini ) . Applied sued Gemini for infringement of four patents related to apparatus and methods of chemical vapor deposition ( CVD ) . Gemini filed four motions for summary judgment challenging the validity of Applied 's patents . The district court granted two of these motions invalidating all four patents and entered a final judgment in favor of Gemini . We vacate and remand . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Background _NEWLINE_ Applied contends that Gemini has infringed U.S. patent Nos . 3,623,712 ( '712 patent ) , 4,047,496 ( '496 patent ) , 4,081,313 ( '313 patent ) , and 4,496,609 ( '609 patent ) . The four patents in suit all grew out of a single application filed by McNeilly and Benzing on October 15 , 1969 . The United States Patent and Trademark Office ( PTO ) required the application be restricted , a requirement that resulted in three applications , each claiming a patentably distinct invention : a radiation heated reactor ( issued as the '712 patent ) , a CVD gas reactant reactor ( issued as the '496 patent ) , and a CVD coating process including both method and apparatus claims ( issued as the '609 and '313 patents ) . Applied elected to prosecute the radiantly heated CVD reactor claims which appear in the '712 patent issued in November 1971 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A divisional application was filed for the CVD gas reactant reactor . After two continuation applications and the execution of a terminal disclaimer , the application for the CVD gas reactant reactor issued in September 1977 , as the '496 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A second divisional application was filed for the coating process , followed by a continuation-in-part application which , inter alia , included the addition of Locke as an inventor . The examiner issued a second restriction requirement resulting in separate applications for the coating method claims , for which Locke was a joint inventor , and the coating apparatus claims . Applied elected to prosecute the coating apparatus claims . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A divisional application was filed for the coating method claims with McNeilly , Benzing , and Locke as the inventors . After another continuation application and another restriction requirement , the '313 patent issued in March 1978 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A continuation application was filed for the coating apparatus claims . Locke was deleted as an inventor . The examiner rejected these claims as prima facie obvious . The United States Patent and Trademark Office Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences and the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals ( CCPA ) , In re McNeilly , 612 F.2d 585 ( C.C.P.A.1979 ) , affirmed the rejections . Finally , after two more continuation applications and the introduction of new evidence to rebut the finding of prima facie obviousness , the '609 patent issued in January 1985 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Gemini requested summary judgment on the invalidity of the four patents in suit in four motions on the following grounds , respectively : ( 1 ) the '609 , '712 , and '496 patents are invalid on the theory of collateral estoppel and res judicata* in view of In re McNeilly ; ( 2 ) the '313 patent is invalid because of anticipation under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 102 ( e ) ; ( 3 ) inequitable conduct on the part of Applied in prosecuting the applications of these patents ; and ( 4 ) double patenting . The district court granted the first two motions , the third was not decided , and the fourth was withdrawn . Only the two motions that were granted are at issue in this appeal . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Issues _NEWLINE_ 1 . Whether the district court erred in holding invalid , under the doctrine of collateral estoppel , the '609 patent because the CCPA affirmed the rejection of the claims of a parent application and the '712 and '496 patents because these patents claim the apparatus used in the process claimed in the '609 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *281 2 . Whether the district court erred in holding the '712 patent as prior art with respect to the '313 patent and the '313 patent to be anticipated by the '712 patent under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 102 ( e ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ OPINION _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The '609 Patent _NEWLINE_ The district court determined that the claims of the '609 patent were barred by the collateral estoppel effects of In re McNeilly . This conclusion was based on its finding that the new evidence introduced by Applied in its continuation applications did not give rise to any genuine issues of material fact regarding obviousness ; therefore , the changes made in the continuation applications were not material as a matter of law . We disagree . The district court erred in not giving proper weight to the patent 's presumption of validity . 35 U.S.C . ¡± 282 ( 1982 ) . The presumption of validity carries with it the assumption that the evidence considered by the PTO when granting the patent was material . In considering a summary judgment motion , since the facts must be construed in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party , United States v. Diebold , Inc. , 369 U.S. 654 , 655 , 82 S.Ct . 993 , 994 , 8 L.Ed.2d 176 ( 1962 ) , the record must show conclusively that the new evidence was immaterial . In this case , nothing in the record indicates this . Therefore , the holding by the district court that the '609 patent is invalid due to collateral estoppel is vacated . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The '712 and '496 Patents _NEWLINE_ The district court held invalid the '712 and '496 patents on the basis of its determination of invalidity of the '609 patent . In light of our holding on the collateral estoppel effects of In re McNeilly on the '609 patent , we also vacate the district court 's holding as to the collateral estoppel effects of that decision on the '712 and '496 patents . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The '313 Patent _NEWLINE_ The district court found the '712 patent fully anticipated the invention claimed in the '313 patent . This finding was based on its determination that the invention claimed in the '712 patent , attributed to McNeilly and Benzing , was invented by a different `` inventive entity '' than that listed in the '313 patent , namely McNeilly , Benzing , and Locke . However , the fact that an application has named a different inventive entity than a patent does not necessarily make that patent prior art . As this court held in In re Kaplan , 789 F.2d 1574 , 229 USPQ 678 ( Fed Cir.1986 ) : _NEWLINE_ When the joint and sole inventions are related , as they are here , inventor A commonly discloses the invention of A & B in the course of describing his sole invention and when he so describes the invention of A & B he is not disclosing `` prior art '' to the A & B invention , even if he has legal status as `` another '' [ 35 U.S.C . ¡± 102 ( e ) ] . _NEWLINE_ Id . at 1576 , 229 USPQ at 680 , quoting , In re Land , 368 F.2d 866 , 879 , 151 USPQ 621 , 633 ( CCPA 1966 ) ( emphasis in original ) . Even though an application and a patent have been conceived by different inventive entities , if they share one or more persons as joint inventors , the 35 U.S.C . ¡± 102 ( e ) exclusion for a patent granted to `` another '' is not necessarily satisfied . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In this case the applications which matured into the '712 and '313 patents all grew from the same original application . Accordingly , if the invention claimed in the '313 patent is fully disclosed in the '712 patent , this invention had to be invented before the filing date of the '712 patent and the latter can not be 102 ( e ) prior art to the '313 patent . See Land , 368 F.2d at 879 , 151 USPQ at 633 ( `` When the 102 ( e ) reference patentee [ '712 ] ... had knowledge of the joint applicants ' invention [ '313 ] by being one of them , and thereafter describes it , he necessarily files the application [ `` 712 ] after the [ '313 ] applicant 's invention date ... . '' ) ( emphasis in original ) . Thus , the district court erred because it invalidity decision was based on the incorrect premise that the '712 patent was 102 ( e ) prior art against the '313 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Conclusion _NEWLINE_ The judgment entered by the district court invalidating the four patents is vacated and the case is remanded . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ VACATED AND REMANDED _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 835 F.2d 279 , 15 U.S.P.Q.2d 1816 _NEWLINE_ Footnotes _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ * _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Since the prior proceeding was ex parte , only the collateral estoppel aspects of the res judicata doctrine will be considered .

( `` ADS '' ) appeals the opinion and order of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas ( `` District Court '' ) denying ADS 's request for attorney fees pursuant to 35 U.S.C . ¡± 285 ( 2012 ) . See Rothschild Connected Devices Innovations , LLC v. Guardian Prot . Servs. , Inc. , No . 2:15-cv-01431-JRG-RSP , 2016 WL 3883549 , at *4 ( E.D . Tex . July 18 , 2016 ) . The District Court found that Appellee Rothschild Connected Devices Innovations , LLC ( `` Rothschild '' ) had not engaged in conduct sufficient to make the litigation `` exceptional , '' such that ADS did not merit attorney fees pursuant to ¡± 285 . See id . at *1-3 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ADS appeals the District Court 's exceptional case determination . We possess subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C . ¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( 2012 ) . We reverse and remand . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ BACKGROUND _NEWLINE_ The instant dispute arises as a consequence of Rothschild 's allegation that ADS 's home security system infringes U.S. Patent No . 8,788,090 ( `` the '090 patent '' ) . The '090 patent generally recites `` [ a ] system and method for creating a personalized consumer product , '' '090 patent , Abstract , where the system and method `` enable a user to customize products containing solids and fluids by allowing a server on the global computer network , e.g. , the Internet , to instruct the hardware mixing the solids and fluids of the user 's preferences for the final mix , '' id . col. 1 ll . 58-62 . Rothschild has filed numerous lawsuits against various parties alleging infringement of the '090 patent . J.A . 1086 , 1097 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Rothschild filed a complaint against ADS alleging infringement of claim 1 of the '090 patent . J.A . 62 , 73 . ADS responded by filing an answer and counterclaims . J.A . 84-92 . ADS subsequently sent an email to Rothschild alleging that the '090 patent covers patent-ineligible subject matter under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 1011 and that prior art anticipates claim 1 of the '090 patent under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 102 ( a ) ( 1 ) .2 J.A . *1386 704 . ADS offered to settle the case if Rothschild paid ADS $ 43,330 for attorney fees and costs . J.A . 704 . Rothschild rejected ADS 's offer . J.A . 855 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ADS next filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings , arguing that claim 1 of the '090 patent covers patent-ineligible subject matter under ¡± 101 . J.A . 93-104 . ADS also sent Rothschild a notice pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 ( c ) ( 2 ) ( `` Safe Harbor Notice '' ) ,3 which included copies of a proposed Rule 11 ( b ) motion for sanctions and prior art that purportedly anticipates claim 1 . J.A . 270 , 685 . In light of the Safe Harbor Notice , Rothschild voluntarily moved to dismiss its action . See J.A . 247 . ADS opposed and filed a cross-motion for attorney fees pursuant to ¡± 285,4 see J.A . 249 , based on its view that Rothschild 's suit was objectively unreasonable because Rothschild knew or should have known that claim 1 covers patent-ineligible subject matter under ¡± 101 and is anticipated by prior art under ¡± 102 ( a ) ( 1 ) , see J.A . 261-64 . ADS also argued that Rothschild did not intend to test the merits of its claim and instead filed this and over fifty other lawsuits in the District Court to `` 'exploit [ ] the high cost to defend complex litigation to extract nuisance value settlements ' `` from various defendants . J.A . 265 ( brackets omitted ) ( quoting Eon-Net LP v. Flagstar Bancorp , 653 F.3d 1314 , 1327 ( Fed . Cir . 2011 ) ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The District Court ultimately granted Rothschild 's Motion to Dismiss and denied ADS 's Cross-Motion for attorney fees . Rothschild , 2016 WL 3883549 , at *4 . As to the latter , the District Court found that Rothschild did not engage in conduct sufficient to make the action `` exceptional '' under ¡± 285 . Id . The District Court found that Rothschild 's `` decision to voluntarily withdraw its [ C ] omplaint within the safe harbor period is the type of reasonable conduct Rule 11 is designed to encourage . '' Id . at *2 . The District Court also found that Rothschild recited `` non-conclusory and facially plausible arguments supporting patent eligibility '' under ¡± 101 . Id . Turning to the anticipation allegations , the District Court found that ADS neither filed a motion seeking to invalidate claim 1 of the '090 patent under ¡± 102 ( a ) ( 1 ) nor demonstrated that Rothschild failed to conduct a reasonable pre-suit investigation of the prior art . Id . Finally , the District Court held that Rothschild 's numerous other suits for infringement pending against other companies did not alone make the case exceptional . Id . at *3 . This appeal followed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ DISCUSSION _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I . Legal Framework and Standard of Review _NEWLINE_ A `` court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing *1387 party . '' 35 U.S.C . ¡± 285 . The Supreme Court has explained that an exceptional case , though rare , _NEWLINE_ is simply one that stands out from others with respect to the substantive strength of a party 's litigating position ( considering both the governing law and the facts of the case ) or the unreasonable manner in which the case was litigated . District courts may determine whether a case is `` exceptional '' in the case-by-case exercise of their discretion , considering the totality of the circumstances . _NEWLINE_ Octane Fitness , LLC v. ICON Health & Fitness , Inc. , -- - U.S. -- -- , 134 S.Ct . 1749 , 1756 , 188 L.Ed.2d 816 ( 2014 ) ( footnote omitted ) ; see id . at 1757 ( explaining that `` a district court may award fees in the rare case in which a party 's unreasonable conduct-while not independently sanctionable-is nonetheless so 'exceptional ' as to justify an award of fees '' ) . In weighing the evidence , the district court may consider , among other factors , `` frivolousness , motivation , objective unreasonableness ( both in the factual and legal components of the case ) [ , ] and the need in particular circumstances to advance considerations of compensation and deterrence . '' Id . at 1756 n.6 ( internal quotation marks and citation omitted ) ; see also id . at 1758 ( explaining that a ¡± 285 attorney fee award is appropriate `` when the losing party has acted in bad faith , vexatiously , wantonly , or for oppressive reasons '' ( internal quotation marks and citation omitted ) ) . An exceptional case determination must find support in a `` preponderance of the evidence . '' Id . at 1758 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ `` We review all aspects of a district court 's ¡± 285 determination for an abuse of discretion , '' Lumen View Tech . LLC v. Findthebest.com , Inc. , 811 F.3d 479 , 482 ( Fed . Cir . 2016 ) ( citation omitted ) , including its `` exceptional case determination , '' SFA Sys. , LLC v. Newegg Inc. , 793 F.3d 1344 , 1347 ( Fed . Cir . 2015 ) ( citation omitted ) . An abuse of discretion occurs when , inter alia , the district court `` base [ s ] its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence . '' Highmark Inc. v. Allcare Health Mgmt . Sys. , Inc. , -- - U.S. -- -- , 134 S.Ct . 1744 , 1748 n.2 , 188 L.Ed.2d 829 ( 2014 ) ( internal quotation marks and citation omitted ) . `` A factual finding is clearly erroneous if , despite some supporting evidence , we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made . '' Insite Vision Inc. v. Sandoz , Inc. , 783 F.3d 853 , 858 ( Fed . Cir . 2015 ) ( internal quotation marks and citation omitted ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ II . The District Court 's Exceptional Case Determination Constitutes an Abuse of Discretion _NEWLINE_ ADS challenges the District Court 's exceptional case determination on several grounds . First , ADS alleges that the District Court failed to properly assess the weakness of Rothschild 's litigating position because claim 1 of the '090 patent covers patent-ineligible subject matter under ¡± 101 and is anticipated by the prior art under ¡± 102 ( a ) ( 1 ) . See Appellant 's Br . 18-32 . Second , ADS avers that `` the District Court failed to consider Rothschild 's willful ignorance of the prior art , '' which further demonstrates the weakness of Rothschild 's litigating position . Id . at 32 ( capitalization modified ) ; see id . at 32-35 . Third , ADS contends that Rothschild engaged in vexatious litigation by bringing suit solely to extract a nuisance payment , citing the numerous lawsuits that Rothschild has filed regarding the '090 patent . See id . at 37-40 . Fourth , ADS argues that the District Court failed to `` consider the totality of the circumstances as required by Octane Fitness '' because , inter alia , it `` improperly conflat [ ed ] the provisions of Rule 11 and *1388 relief under [ ¡± ] 285 . '' Id . at 40 ; see id . at 40-43 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We need not address ADS 's first argument because the second , third , and fourth arguments demonstrate an abuse of discretion . We address these three arguments in turn . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A . The District Court Misjudged the Strength of Rothschild 's Litigating Position in Consideration of the Prior Art _NEWLINE_ ADS avers that Rothschild submitted affidavits that include statements `` evidenc [ ing ] a conscious disregard for Rothschild 's continuing obligation to inquire into the merits of its case . '' Id . at 33 . According to ADS , the District Court did `` not address [ ] these troubling statements . '' Id . ADS argues that the District Court thus `` fail [ ed ] to properly assess the substantive strength of Rothschild 's litigating position . '' Id . at 35 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The District Court clearly erred by failing to consider Rothschild 's willful ignorance of the prior art . In its Safe Harbor Notice and Cross-Motion for attorney fees , ADS included prior art that purportedly anticipates claim 1 of the '090 patent . J.A . 293-94 , 334-679 , 685 . In response to ADS 's Cross-Motion for attorney fees , Rothschild submitted two affidavits relevant here . In the first , Rothschild 's counsel stated that he had `` not conducted an analysis of any of the prior art asserted in [ the ] Cross [ ] Motion to form a belief as to whether that prior art would invalidate '' the '090 patent . J.A . 708 . In the second , Rothschild 's founder echoed these statements . J.A . 712-13 . However , in the same affidavits , Rothschild 's counsel and founder both assert that they possessed a `` good faith '' belief that the '090 patent `` is valid . '' J.A . 708 , 712 . It is unclear how Rothschild 's counsel and founder could reasonably believe that claim 1 is valid if neither analyzed the purportedly invalidating prior art provided by ADS.5 More problematic here , the District Court did not address these incongruent statements in its analysis . See generally Rothschild , 2016 WL 3883549 . A district court abuses its discretion when , as here , it `` fail [ s ] to conduct an adequate inquiry . '' Atl . Research Mktg . Sys. , Inc. v. Troy , 659 F.3d 1345 , 1360 ( Fed . Cir . 2011 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Other aspects of the relevant affidavits reveal additional problems with the District Court 's analysis . For example , Rothschild 's counsel attested that ADS 's proposed Rule 11 ( b ) motion `` should not be granted , '' J.A . 708 , and Rothschild 's founder stated that the Rule 11 ( b ) motion `` should be found ... meritless , '' J.A . 713 . Rothschild 's counsel and founder reached those conclusions without examining the purportedly anticipatory prior art references attached to the Safe Harbor Notice . See J.A . 708 , 712-13 . It is unclear how Rothschild 's counsel and founder reasonably *1389 could assert that ADS 's Rule 11 ( b ) Motion would be meritless if they did not assess the prior art that accompanied the Safe Harbor Notice . Once again , the District Court did not address these inconsistent statements in its analysis . See generally Rothschild , 2016 WL 3883549 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Rothschild nevertheless asserts that it `` brought its claims against ADS in good faith , '' that its counsel reviewed the prior art and determined that ADS 's home security system infringed claim 1 of the '090 patent , and that it continues to believe that the '090 patent is valid . Appellee 's Br . 9 ( footnote omitted ) . In support of its position , Rothschild cites its opposition to ADS 's Cross-Motion for attorney fees , id . at 9 nn . 33-35 ( citing J.A . 693 ) , and its Opposition in turn cites the affidavits discussed above , J.A . 693 ( citing J.A . 707-08 , 712 ) . In his affidavit , Rothschild 's counsel asserts that , before filing the lawsuit , he made a `` good faith '' determination `` that the accused [ ADS ] products infringed at least claim 1 '' and that he `` assisted in preparing a claim chart identifying how the elements of claim 1 of the [ '090 patent ] read on the products accused of infringement . '' J.A . 707 , 708 . Rothschild 's counsel also asserts that he `` believe [ s ] , in good faith , that the [ '090 patent ] is valid and infringed . '' J.A . 708 . Rothschild 's founder makes a similar statement as to the validity of the '090 patent . J.A . 712 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ None of the cited statements assist Rothschild here . In his declaration , Rothschild 's counsel states that he `` reviewed publicly available information regarding ADS 's products and , in good faith , made a determination that the accused products infringed at least claim 1 of the [ '090 patent ] . '' J.A . 707 . Rothschild 's founder makes similar statements in his declaration . See J.A . 712 . However , neither Rothschild 's counsel nor its founder supports their declaration statements with examples of websites , product brochures , manuals , or any other publicly available information that they purportedly reviewed.6 The conclusory and unsupported statements from Rothschild 's counsel and founder that claim 1 of the '090 patent is valid have no evidentiary value . See Phigenix , Inc. v. ImmunoGen , Inc. , 845 F.3d 1168 , 1174-75 & n.6 ( Fed . Cir . 2017 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B . The District Court Misjudged Rothschild 's Conduct in Other Litigation _NEWLINE_ ADS next alleges that Rothschild has engaged in vexatious litigation related to the '090 patent . According to ADS , Rothschild has asserted claim 1 of the '090 patent in fifty-eight cases against technologies ranging from video cameras to coffeemakers to heat pumps . Appellant 's Br . 9 . Further , ADS contends that Rothschild has settled the vast majority , if not all , of these cases for significantly below the average cost of defending an infringement lawsuit . See id . at 37-40 . The District Court rejected ADS 's contention , finding `` the fact that a patentee has asserted a patent against a wide variety of defendants and settled many of those cases ... does not alone show bad faith . '' Rothschild , 2016 WL 3883549 , at *3 ( emphasis added ) ( internal quotation marks and citation omitted ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The District Court based this aspect of its analysis on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence . The District Court predicated its finding on `` the absence of any showing that [ Rothschild ] acted unreasonably or in bad faith in the context of this suit . '' Id . ( footnote omitted ) . However , *1390 as explained above , that ancillary finding improperly rests upon statements from Rothschild 's counsel and founder that have no evidentiary value . Therefore , in the absence of evidence demonstrating that Rothschild engaged in reasonable conduct before the District Court , the undisputed evidence regarding Rothschild 's vexatious litigation warrants an affirmative exceptional case finding here . See Newegg , 793 F.3d at 1350 ( `` [ A ] pattern of litigation abuses characterized by the repeated filing of patent infringement actions for the sole purpose of forcing settlements , with no intention of testing the merits of one 's claims , is relevant to a district court 's exceptional case determination under ¡± 285 . `` ) ; see also Eon-Net , 653 F.3d at 1327 ( noting that settlement offers that were `` less than ten percent of the cost that [ a defendant ] expended to defend suit-effectively ensured that [ a plaintiff 's ] baseless infringement allegations remain unexposed '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ C. The District Court Improperly Conflated Rule 11 with 35 U.S.C . ¡± 285 _NEWLINE_ Finally , we turn to ADS 's argument that the District Court failed to account for the totality of the circumstances by equating Rule 11 to ¡± 285 . The District Court held that `` ¡± 285 should [ not ] be applied in a manner that contravenes the aims of Rule 11- [ Rothschild ] 's decision to voluntarily withdraw its complaint within the safe harbor period is the type of reasonable conduct [ that ] Rule 11 is designed to encourage . '' Rothschild , 2016 WL 3883549 , at *2 . ADS avers that the District Court 's analysis `` improperly conflat [ ed ] the provisions of Rule 11 and relief under [ ¡± ] 285 . '' Appellant 's Br . 40 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The District Court erred as a matter of law when , as part of its analysis , it stated that an attorney fee award under ¡± 285 would `` contravene [ ] the aims of Rule 11 [ 's ] '' safe-harbor provision . Rothschild , 2016 WL 3883549 , at *2 . Whether a party avoids or engages in sanctionable conduct under Rule 11 ( b ) `` is not the appropriate benchmark '' ; indeed , `` a district court may award fees in the rare case in which a party 's unreasonable conduct-while not necessarily independently sanctionable-is nonetheless so 'exceptional ' as to justify an award of fees . '' Octane Fitness , 134 S.Ct . at 1756 , 1757 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ CONCLUSION _NEWLINE_ We have considered ADS 's remaining arguments ( except for those related to its first point ) and find them unpersuasive . The District Court on remand shall conduct additional proceedings consistent with this opinion , including those pertaining to the calculation of attorney fees . Accordingly , the Opinion and Order of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas is _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ REVERSED AND REMANDED _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ COSTS _NEWLINE_ Costs to ADS . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Mayer , Circuit Judge , concurring . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I agree with the court 's opinion , but write separately because this case also satisfies the Supreme Court 's admonition that `` a case presenting ... exceptionally meritless claims may sufficiently set itself apart from mine-run cases to warrant a fee award . '' Octane Fitness , LLC v. ICON Health & Fitness , Inc. , -- - U.S. -- -- , 134 S.Ct . 1749 , 1757 , 188 L.Ed.2d 816 ( 2014 ) . Because the infringement complaint filed by Rothschild Connected Devices Innovations , LLC ( `` Rothschild '' ) was frivolous on its face , the district court abused its discretion in refusing to award attorneys ' fees under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 285 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1391 Claim 1 of U.S. Patent No . 8,788,090 patent ( the `` '090 patent '' ) is directed to the abstract idea of product configuration , reciting `` [ a ] system for customizing a product according to a user 's preferences '' using `` a remote server including a database . '' '090 patent col.8 ll.66-67 . Both the specification and the prosecution history indicate that claim 1 is limited to consumable liquid products . See , e.g. , id . col.1 ll.21-62 ; id . col.4 ll.40-64 ; Joint Appendix ( `` J.A . '' ) 769 , 799-804 , 821 , 846-47 . Nonetheless , Rothschild has filed scores of infringement complaints , taking an exceptionally broad view of the scope of its patent and asserting that it covers dozens of seemingly unrelated `` products '' configured using the Internet . J.A . 99-100 , 878 . The breadth of technologies that have been accused of infringement is remarkable , including such diverse products as home automation systems , home security systems , door locks , mobile apps , thermostats , digital cameras , irrigation sprinklers , coffeemakers , washers , dryers , baby monitors , air conditioners , microwave ovens , dishwashers , smoke detectors , ceiling fans , window shades , pool heaters , telephones , and horns . See J.A . 256-58 . Rothschild 's continued assertions that its patent extends to products simply because they are configured using the Internet , see Brief of Plaintiff-Appellee at 19-21 , are risible rather than simply unreasonable . * _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In assessing patent eligibility under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 101 , `` the underlying functional concern ... is a relative one : how much future innovation is foreclosed relative to the contribution of the inventor . '' Mayo Collaborative Servs . v. Prometheus Labs. , Inc. , 566 U.S. 66 , 88 , 132 S.Ct . 1289 , 182 L.Ed.2d 321 ( 2012 ) ; see also Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg . Co. , 243 U.S. 502 , 511 , 37 S.Ct . 416 , 61 L.Ed . 871 ( 1917 ) ( explaining that `` the primary purpose '' of the patent system is to promote scientific progress , not to `` creat [ e ] ... private fortunes for the owners of patents '' ) . The '090 patent falls far beyond the bounds of section 101 because its potential to disrupt future innovation is staggering while its technological contribution is non-existent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Because section 101 imposes `` a threshold test , '' Bilski v. Kappos , 561 U.S. 593 , 602 , 130 S.Ct . 3218 , 177 L.Ed.2d 792 ( 2010 ) , patent eligibility issues generally can , and should , be resolved at the outset of litigation . Neither nuanced legal analysis nor complex technical inquiry was required to determine that the '090 patent could not be both broad enough to cover the home security products sold by ADS Security , L.P. ( `` ADS '' ) and narrow enough to withstand subject matter eligibility scrutiny . See Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank Int ' l , -- - U.S. -- -- , 134 S.Ct . 2347 , 2356-59 , 189 L.Ed.2d 296 ( 2014 ) ( emphasizing that abstract ideas applied using generic computer components are patent ineligible ) ; Intellectual Ventures I LLC v. Capital One Bank , 792 F.3d 1363 , 1369 ( Fed . Cir . 2015 ) ( concluding that a patent directed to `` customizing web page content '' based upon `` information known about the user '' fell outside of section 101 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This suit never should have been filed , and ADS deserves to be fully compensated for the significant attorneys ' fees it has incurred . To hold otherwise would only `` encourage the litigation of unreasonable [ and ] groundless claims . '' *1392 Highway Equip . Co. , Inc. v. FECO , Ltd. , 469 F.3d 1027 , 1035 ( Fed .

'' In other words , before a party may seek Rule 11 sanctions against another party , the first party must provide the second party with notice of its intent to seek sanctions and afford the second party twenty-one days to take corrective action . See Fed . R. Civ . P. 11 ( c ) ( 2 ) . The twenty-one day period is known as the `` safe harbor '' period . See , e.g. , Orenshteyn v. Citrix Sys. , Inc. , 341 Fed.Appx . 621 , 626 ( Fed . Cir . 2009 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 4 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Cross-Motion included the purportedly anticipatory prior art references and accompanying claim charts that ADS included in the Safe Harbor Notice . See J.A . 293-94 , 299-332 , 334-679 , 685 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 5 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Rothschild 's counsel stated during oral argument that the affidavits meant to convey that Rothschild 's counsel and founder had reviewed the references and reached a conclusion different from ADS . See Oral Argument at 13:42-14:00 , http : //oralarguments.cafc.uscourts.gov/default.aspx ? fl=2016-2521.mp3 . That position is unavailing for two reasons . First , the affidavits ' terms simply do not support Rothschild 's position because they do not include any language suggesting that Rothschild 's counsel or founder had reviewed the references . See J.A . 707-09 , 711-14 . Second , Rothschild 's contention at Oral Argument belies the position that it took during the hearing before the District Court , at which it stated that ADS had failed to produce the prior art references .

The patent was held unenforceable by the United States District Court for the District of Delaware , Murray M. Schwartz , Chief Judge , 694 F.Supp . 1 , and patent holder appealed . The Court of Appeals , Markey , Chief Judge , held that the patent for method of using drug as muscle relaxant was unenforceable because of inequitable conduct in its procurement , both in withholding material prior art and in misrepresenting that drug was free of side effects ordinarily associated with nervous system depressants . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Affirmed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Attorneys and Law Firms _NEWLINE_ *1418 Joseph M.

( Merck ) appeals from a judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Delaware ( Schwartz , C.J . ) , 694 F.Supp . 1 ( D.Del.1988 ) , holding its U.S. Patent No . 3,882,246 ( '246 ) unenforceable because of inequitable conduct . We affirm . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ BACKGROUND _NEWLINE_ Presuming familiarity with Chief Judge Schwartz ' comprehensive opinion , we describe here only the basic procedural facts and those particularly relevant to Merck 's arguments on appeal . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Merck 's '246 patent claims a method of using cyclobenzaprine to treat certain types of skeletal muscle disorders . The '246 patent is the result of four applications : a July 7 , 1970 Canadian application ; a May 21 , 1971 United States application that was rejected , amended , and finally *1419 abandoned ; a January 31 , 1973 continuation-in-part ( c-i-p ) application that was rejected , amended , and discussed in an interview at which claims 1-5 were indicated as allowable ; and an April 9 , 1974 c-i-p application in which those claims were again allowed . On May 6 , 1975 the '246 patent issued . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Applying in September 1970 for Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) approval to sell cyclobenzaprine for use as set forth in the patent , Merck had submitted to FDA an Investigational New Drug application that contained studies of cyclobenzaprine and amitriptyline as muscle relaxants . Cyclobenzaprine 's selectivity was emphasized.1 In July 1973 , Merck had submitted to FDA a report compiling , summarizing , and evaluating its cyclobenzaprine research and noting that the predominant side effect was drowsiness . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In December 1975 , Merck submitted to FDA a New Drug Application ( NDA ) seeking approval to sell cyclobenzaprine as a skeletal muscle relaxant . Merck 's NDA submissions were consistent with the earlier submissions and referred to cyclobenzaprine 's `` propensity for inducing drowsiness . '' The FDA approved Merck 's sale of cyclobenzaprine as `` an adjunct to rest and physical therapy for relief of muscle spasm associated with acute painful musculoskeletal conditions . '' The package insert cited drowsiness as the most frequent side effect . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On October 31 , 1986 , Danbury Pharmacal , Inc. ( Danbury ) filed an abbreviated new drug application seeking FDA approval to sell a generic version of cyclobenzaprine for the same purpose . See 35 U.S.C . ¡± 271 ( e ) ( 2 ) ( Supp . IV 1987 ) . On December 17 , 1986 , Merck sued Danbury for infringement . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ District Court Opinion _NEWLINE_ The only issues at trial were those centered on Danbury 's defenses : ( 1 ) the claimed use of cyclobenzaprine would have been obvious in view of the chemical , pharmacological and clinical properties of the prior art compound amitriptyline ; and ( 2 ) the patent is unenforceable because Merck intentionally withheld prior art disclosures of amitriptyline and misrepresented cyclobenzaprine 's side effects . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 . Obviousness _NEWLINE_ The court determined that : the Sinha publications , Lance 's work on headaches , and amitriptyline 's use in treating Parkinson 's disease all `` strongly indicate amitriptyline 's effectiveness as a muscle relaxant '' ; amitriptyline and cyclobenzaprine `` shar [ e ] a pharmacological resemblance '' ; `` several prior art publications teach that amitriptyline and cyclobenzaprine behave similarly in a variety of tests '' ; and Merck 's tests indicated that amitriptyline was effective `` as a skeletal muscle relaxant , but cyclobenzaprine was superior in potency and selectivity . '' The court went on , however , to determine that the prior art did not disclose a reasonable expectation of cyclobenzaprine 's selectivity . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The court found that Danbury failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that the '246 patent was invalid for obviousness , concluding : _NEWLINE_ cyclobenzaprine is distinct from previously known compounds in its selectivity . Even if amitriptyline is a selective skeletal muscle relaxant of the class of cyclobenzaprine , no suggestion existed in the art that either would be selective in action ... . [ T ] he instant dispute concerns the relationship between two compounds with truly unexpected properties ... . Selectivity is simply not foreshadowed in the art , much less strongly suggested . _NEWLINE_ 694 F.Supp . at 32 ( latter emphasis provided ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Danbury has not in this appeal challenged the determination of nonobviousness . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 2 . Inequitable Conduct _NEWLINE_ Dealing with the withholding of prior art , the court determined that : Merck knew of *1420 amitriptyline 's muscle relaxant properties , and of the Sinha and Lance prior art references , but withheld all of that from the Patent and Trademark Office ( PTO ) ; Merck 's explanation for the disparity in its FDA and PTO submissions ( FDA would require comparisons with amitriptyline ) `` strains credulity '' ; Merck deleted amitriptyline from the inventor 's 1975 published article ; and Merck 's argument that amitriptyline was immaterial was `` untenable in light of the evidence . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Dealing with the allegation of misrepresentation , the court found that Merck , in prosecuting its four applications , argued over and over that cyclobenzaprine was free of the side effects ordinarily associated with nervous system depressants ; Merck 's FDA submissions and its own data indicated its awareness of at least one such side effect , i.e. , drowsiness ; Merck nonetheless told the PTO that cyclobenzaprine was free of `` side effects of depression or causing muscle weakness and drowsiness '' ; and Merck 's conduct was `` highly misleading , and most certainly material . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The court held the '246 patent unenforceable for inequitable conduct in view of FMC Corp. v. Manitowoc Co. , 835 F.2d 1411 , 5 U.S.P.Q.2d 1112 ( Fed.Cir.1987 ) , reasoning that : _NEWLINE_ ( i ) Merck withheld material prior art information concerning amitriptyline and misrepresented cyclobenzaprine 's selectivity in response to the examiner 's objections to allowing the claims ; ( ii ) the persons responsible for the patent prosecution , Arther [ Merck 's patent agent ] and Share [ the inventor ] , admittedly knew of the omitted information and of its materiality ; [ and ] ( iii ) damning evidence in the form of documents and chains of events that the omissions and misrepresentation were intended to mislead the PTO . _NEWLINE_ 694 F.Supp . at 35 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ISSUE _NEWLINE_ Whether the district court abused its discretion in declaring the '246 patent unenforceable for having been inequitably procured.2 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ OPINION _NEWLINE_ Equitable in nature , the question of inequitable conduct is committed to the discretion of the trial court whose determination is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard . Kingsdown Medical Consultants Ltd. v. Hollister Inc. , 863 F.2d 867 , 876 , 9 U.S.P.Q.2d 1384 , 1392 ( Fed.Cir.1988 ) ( in banc ) . `` 'To overturn a discretionary ruling of a district court , the appellant must establish that the ruling is based upon clearly erroneous findings of fact or a misapplication or misinterpretation of applicable law or that the ruling evidences a clear error of judgment on the part of the district court . ' `` Id . ( quoting PPG Indus . v. Celanese Polymer Specialities Co. , 840 F.2d 1565 , 1572 , 6 U.S.P.Q.2d 1010 , 1016 ( Fed.Cir.1988 ) ( Bissell , J. , additional views ) ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ `` Inequitable conduct resides in failure to disclose material information , or submission of false information , with an intent to deceive ... . '' Kingsdown , 863 F.2d at 872 , 9 U.S.P.Q.2d at 1389 . Although Merck takes issue with the finding of intent , it mounts its major attack on the findings that the withheld prior art and its misrepresentations were material , saying that neither related to the selectivity of cyclobenzaprine . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 . Materiality _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ a . Withheld prior art _NEWLINE_ First , Merck says the determinations of nonobviousness and materiality of the withheld prior art are inconsistent , because prior art that did not render the invention claimed in the '246 patent obvious ( because selectivity was not `` foreshadowed '' in that art ) could not be material . Second , in view of the claim limitation to *1421 selectivity , Merck argues that the withheld prior art is merely cumulative because neither of the two references considered by the examiner were selective . See Specialty Composites v. Cabot Corp. , 845 F.2d 981 , 992 , 6 U.S.P.Q.2d 1601 , 1609 ( Fed.Cir.1988 ) ; Manitowoc , 835 F.2d at 1415 , 5 U.S.P.Q.2d at 1115 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ First , Merck wrongly presupposes a `` but for '' standard of materiality . Materiality may be established , as it was here , by a showing that a reasonable examiner would consider the withheld prior art important in deciding whether to issue the patent . In re Jerabek , 789 F.2d 886 , 890 , 229 U.S.P.Q . 530 , 533 ( Fed.Cir.1986 ) . Here , as the district court correctly found , `` amitriptyline 's activity was comparable to cyclobenzaprine 's , '' 694 F.Supp . at 35 , both having similar properties and effects . Thus the withheld prior art would clearly have been important to a reasonable examiner . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Second , the withheld prior art is not merely cumulative because amitriptyline was , as indicated in Merck 's own tests , by far the most relevant to skeletal muscle relaxation . To FDA , Merck disclosed amitriptyline , not the cited prior art to which it now says amitriptyline would have been merely cumulative . That the claimed invention may have been superior in one property to both the cited and withheld prior art may be a basis for patentability ; it can not serve automatically to render the withheld prior art either cumulative or immaterial . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ b. Misrepresentation _NEWLINE_ Merck says : first , its misrepresentation that cyclobenzaprine did not cause drowsiness is immaterial because drowsiness is unrelated to selectivity ; second , its single statement on drowsiness has been taken out of context because drowsiness in proper context refers to drowsiness accompanying muscle weakness ; third , absence of a drowsiness effect was not relied on by the examiner in deciding to allow the '246 patent ; and fourth , it did not misrepresent cyclobenzaprine 's unique selectivity . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ First , the court found that cyclobenzaprine 's selectivity was related to the side effect of drowsiness . It stated that `` [ t ] o the extent drowsiness falls within the spectrum of sedation , it appears ... that cyclobenzaprine produces sedative effects , although not muscle weakness , '' and thus `` cyclobenzaprine 's selectivity is limited to its operation without loss of normal muscle tone . '' Merck has not shown that finding to have been clearly erroneous or that the district court abused its discretion in so viewing the evidence . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Second , the district court did address Merck 's single June 1972 description of cyclobenzaprine 's action as free of `` the attendant side effects of depression or causing muscle weakness and drowsiness . '' The court 's reference to that one statement as the most glaring misrepresentation , however , was not out of context and does not limit its misrepresentation findings to that one statement . The entirety of the district court 's opinion recognizes the misrepresentations of cyclobenzaprine 's side effects made throughout the patent prosecution : `` [ e ] qually disturbing is Merck 's blatant misrepresentation of the side effects of cyclobenzaprine in response to the examiner 's reluctance ( to put it mildly ) to allow the claims . '' 694 F.Supp . at 35 . Merck was aware of the side effect of drowsiness and that it clearly resembles side effects ordinarily associated with nervous system depressants . Thus the court correctly cited a pattern of misrepresentations regarding cyclobenzaprine 's freedom from the attendant side effects ordinarily associated with nervous system depressants . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Third , Merck again improperly argues for a `` but for '' standard of materiality in its assumption that the examiner did not rely on its drowsiness misrepresentation . To be material , a misrepresentation need not be relied on by the examiner in deciding to allow the patent . The matter misrepresented need only be within a reasonable examiner 's realm of consideration . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Fourth , in view of cyclobenzaprine 's and amitriptyline 's comparable activity reflected in Merck 's tests , we can not say the court abused its discretion in finding that Merck 's representation on the invention 's *1422 unique selectivity `` was not entirely accurate '' . Whether that representation must be deemed a fatal misrepresentation is of little or no moment , however , in light of Merck 's pattern of misrepresentations . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 2 . Intent _NEWLINE_ Intent need not , and rarely can , be proven by direct evidence . It is most often proven by `` a showing of acts the natural consequences of which are presumably intended by the actor . '' Kansas Jack , Inc. v. Kuhn , 719 F.2d 1144 , 1151 , 219 U.S.P.Q . 857 , 861 ( Fed.Cir.1983 ) . In light of all the evidence rightly described by the court as `` damning '' , including Share 's and Arther 's knowledge of the highly material amitriptyline prior art , the simultaneous submission of amitriptyline data to FDA and its withholding from the PTO , the material misrepresentation to the PTO of cyclobenzaprine 's side effects , and the decision to delete the amitriptyline portion of the inventor 's 1975 article , we can not say that the court 's finding of intent to mislead was clearly erroneous . Nor can we conclude that the court abused its discretion in determining that Merck was guilty of inequitable conduct . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ AFFIRMED . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 873 F.2d 1418 , 10 U.S.P.Q.2d 1682 _NEWLINE_ Footnotes _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court indicated that `` selectivity '' refers to the ability of a muscle relaxant to reduce abnormal ( hypertonic ) muscle tone without reducing normal muscle tone . The inventor testified that he sought a drug `` without behavioral depressant effects which would impair the normal motor activity associated with the ability to carry out the tasks of daily living . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 2 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Finding that Merck 's `` flagrant '' inequitable conduct made this an `` exceptional case '' , 35 U.S.C . ¡± 285 ( 1982 ) , the court awarded attorney fees to Danbury . Merck 's brief attacks the award only on the ground that the inequitable conduct determination is wrong . That attack having failed , we affirm the award . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_

Dissenting opinion filed by Circuit Judge GAJARSA . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ NEWMAN , Circuit Judge . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This appeal is from the grant of a preliminary injunction , pending final resolution of the several challenges raised by Sandoz , Inc. to the validity , enforceability , and infringement of the Abbott Laboratories patents in suit.1 We conclude that abuse of discretion has not been shown in the district court 's decision to grant the injunction pendente lite . That decision is affirmed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ BACKGROUND _NEWLINE_ This suit concerns two Abbott Laboratories patents on extended release formulations of the antibiotic drug clarithromycin , sold by Abbott with the brand name Biaxin ( r ) XL . The patent on clarithromycin itself expired in 2005 ; only extended release formulations are at issue . The purpose of the extended release formulation is to extend the period of drug effectiveness after ingestion and thereby to reduce the requisite frequency of dosage . Sandoz filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application ( ANDA ) for its extended release formulation of clarithromycin ; the Food and Drug Administration approved the ANDA on August 25 , 2005 , and on September 16 , 2005 Abbott filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois , charging Sandoz with infringement of United States Patent No . 6,010,718 ( the ¡¬718 patent ) and Patent No . 6,551,616 ( the ¡¬616 patent ) . Abbott also charged infringement *1344 of Patent No . 6,872,407 , but has withdrawn this patent from suit . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The ¡¬718 patent claims an extended release pharmaceutical composition comprising an erythromycin derivative and a pharmaceutically acceptable polymer , whereby after ingestion certain specified parameters of drug bioavailability are met . Claims 1 , 4 , and 6 of the ¡¬718 patent are in suit : _NEWLINE_ 1 . A pharmaceutical composition for extended release of an erythromycin derivative in the gastrointestinal environment , comprising an erythromycin derivative and from about 5 to about 50 % by weight of a pharmaceutically acceptable polymer , so that when ingested orally , the composition induces statistically significantly lower mean fluctuation index in the plasma than an immediate release composition of the erythromycin derivative while maintaining bioavailability substantially equivalent to that of the immediate release composition of the erythromycin derivative . _NEWLINE_ 4 . A pharmaceutical composition for extended release of an erythromycin derivative in the gastrointestinal environment , comprising an erythromycin derivative and from about 5 to about 50 % by weight of a pharmaceutically acceptable polymer , so that upon oral ingestion , maximum peak concentrations of the erythromycin derivative are lower than those produced by an immediate release pharmaceutical composition , and area under the concentration-time curve and the minimum plasma concentrations are substantially equivalent to that of the immediate release pharmaceutical composition . _NEWLINE_ 6 . An extended release pharmaceutical composition comprising an erythromycin derivative and a pharmaceutically acceptable polymer , the composition having an improved taste profile as compared to the immediate release formulation . _NEWLINE_ The ¡¬616 patent is a continuation-in-part of the ¡¬718 patent , with claims directed to the method of reducing gastrointestinal side effects . Claim 2 is in suit , shown with claim 1 from which it depends : _NEWLINE_ 1 . A method of reducing gastrointestinal adverse side effects comprising administering an effective amount of extended release pharmaceutical composition comprising an erythromycin derivative and a pharmaceutically acceptable polymer . _NEWLINE_ 2 . The method according to claim 1 , wherein the erythromycin derivative is clarithromycin . _NEWLINE_ In response to the charge of infringement Sandoz presented the defenses of invalidity based on anticipation and obviousness , unenforceability based on inequitable conduct , and noninfringement . This appeal is from the district court 's grant of Abbott 's motion for a preliminary injunction , preserving the status quo during the pendency of this litigation . Sandoz challenges the district court 's rulings on all issues . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ VALIDITY ISSUES _NEWLINE_ The district court reviewed the factors relevant to the grant or denial of a preliminary injunction , viz. , ( 1 ) likelihood of success on the merits of the underlying litigation , ( 2 ) whether irreparable harm is likely if the injunction is not granted , ( 3 ) the balance of hardships as between the litigants , and ( 4 ) factors of the public interest . See Oakley , Inc. v. Sunglass Hut Int ' l , 316 F.3d 1331 , 1338-39 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) ; H.H . Robertson Co. v. United Steel Deck , Inc. , 820 F.2d 384 , 387-88 ( Fed.Cir.1987 ) . At the stage of the preliminary injunction , before the issues of fact and law have been fully explored and finally resolved , `` [ t ] he *1345 purpose of a preliminary injunction is merely to preserve the relative positions of the parties until a trial on the merits can be held . '' University of Texas v. Camenisch , 451 U.S. 390 , 395 , 101 S.Ct . 1830 , 68 L.Ed.2d 175 ( 1981 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On appellate review of the grant of a preliminary injunction , the question `` is simply whether the issuance of the injunction constituted an abuse of discretion . '' Doran v. Salem Inn , 422 U.S. 922 , 932 , 95 S.Ct . 2561 , 45 L.Ed.2d 648 ( 1975 ) . `` It is well settled that the granting of a temporary injunction , pending final hearing , is within the sound discretion of the trial court ; and that , upon appeal , an order granting such an injunction will not be disturbed unless contrary to some rule of equity , or the result of improvident exercise of judicial discretion . '' Deckert v. Independence Shares Corp. , 311 U.S. 282 , 290 , 61 S.Ct . 229 , 85 L.Ed . 189 ( 1940 ) . Abuse of discretion is established `` by showing that the court made a clear error of judgment in weighing relevant factors or exercised its discretion based upon an error of law or clearly erroneous factual findings . '' Novo Nordisk of North America , Inc. v. Genentech , Inc. , 77 F.3d 1364 , 1367 ( Fed.Cir.1996 ) . See Cybor Corp. v. FAS Technologies , Inc. , 138 F.3d 1448 , 1460 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) ( en banc ) ( `` A district court abuses its discretion when its decision is based on clearly erroneous findings of fact , is based on erroneous interpretations of the law , or is clearly unreasonable , arbitrary or fanciful. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Sandoz assigns legal error to the district court 's rulings that Abbott is likely to prevail on the issues of validity , infringement , and inequitable conduct , and states that the district court abused its discretion in balancing the equities and granting the injunction . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Anticipation _NEWLINE_ `` Anticipation '' in patent usage means that the claimed invention was previously known and described in a printed publication , explicitly or inherently . Anticipation is established by documentary evidence , and requires that every claim element and limitation is set forth in a single prior art reference , in the same form and order as in the claim . See In re Omeprazole Patent Litigation , 483 F.3d 1364 , 1373 ( Fed.Cir.2007 ) ; Continental Can Co. v. Monsanto Co. , 948 F.2d 1264 , 1267 ( Fed.Cir.1991 ) . An anticipating reference must enable that which it is asserted to anticipate . Omeprazole , 483 F.3d at 1378 ( `` To 'anticipate , ' the identical subject matter must not only be previously known , but the knowledge must be sufficiently enabling to place the information in the possession of the public . `` ) ; Elan Pharmaceuticals , Inc. v. Mayo Found . for Medical Educ . & Research , 346 F.3d 1051 , 1054 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) ( same ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Sandoz argued that the ¡¬718 patent is anticipated by European Patent Publication No . 0,280,571 B1 ( the ¡¬571 Publication ) , which describes `` a sustained release matrix formulation in tablet form comprising from 0.1 % by weight to 90 % by weight of an antimicrobial agent selected from ... erythromycin ... from 5 % by weight to 29 % by weight of a hydrophilic polymer , and from 0.5 % by weight to 25 % by weight of an acrylic polymer ... . '' The ¡¬571 Publication states that hydrophilic polymers such as hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose ( HPMC ) can be used to form a hydrophilic matrix which `` respond [ s ] to increases in pH with a corresponding increase in the permeability of the dosage form . '' Sandoz argued in the district court that although the ¡¬571 Publication does not mention clarithromycin or the specific pharmacokinetic limitations in the ¡¬718 patent claims , the ¡¬571 Publication anticipates the ¡¬718 claims because clarithromycin is an erythromycin derivative and the claimed pharmacokinetic limitations are inherent in the extended release compositions of the ¡¬571 Publication . Sandoz also argued that enablement *1346 of the compositions in the ¡¬571 Publication must be presumed , because the compositions in the ¡¬718 patent are presumed to be enabled and , according to Sandoz , are identical . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Abbott responded that the ¡¬571 Publication can not `` anticipate '' because it does not show the elements of the claims of issue ; it does not mention clarithromycin , it does not disclose the pharmacokinetic criteria stated in the ¡¬718 claims , and it does not enable these limitations , either expressly or inherently . Abbott argued that significant experimentation would be required to ascertain the applicability of any release agent from the large number of release agents mentioned in the ¡¬571 Publication , particularly as applied to a different biological product having different dissolution and metabolic characteristics . Thus Abbott argued that the legal criteria of `` anticipation '' are not met by the ¡¬571 Publication . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court found that Sandoz did not present evidence sufficient to support its argument that `` the ¡¬571 Publication 's teachings would enable Abbott to create an extended release of an erythromycin derivative drug simply based on the structural limitations . '' Abbott , 500 F.Supp.2d at 840 . The district court observed that the ¡¬571 Publication `` does not offer any in vivo dissolution data '' nor state `` the pharmacokinetic profile of its own formulations . '' Id . The court concluded that Sandoz would not be likely to succeed in establishing anticipation by this reference . We discern no clear error in this conclusion , for the ¡¬571 Publication neither describes the product of the ¡¬718 claims nor enables the pharmacokinetic properties that are set forth in the ¡¬718 claims . See Elan Pharmaceuticals , 346 F.3d at 1057 ( an anticipating reference must disclose every element of the claims , and place a person of ordinary skill in possession of the claimed invention ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Obviousness _NEWLINE_ Sandoz also argued that the claims of the ¡¬781 and ¡¬616 patents are invalid on the ground of obviousness , in view of the combination of the ¡¬571 Publication with PCT Application WO 95/30422 ( the PCT or ¡¬422 Application ) and United States Patent No . 5,705,190 ( the ¡¬190 patent ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In determining , for preliminary injunction purposes , the likelihood that patent invalidity would be established at trial , the district court evaluates the factual and legal arguments in light of the presumptions and burdens that will inhere at trial , viz. , that `` [ a ] patent shall be presumed valid ... . The burden of establishing invalidity of a patent or any claim thereof shall rest on the party asserting such invalidity . '' 35 U.S.C . ¡± 282 . This burden `` exists at every stage of the litigation . '' Canon Computer Systems , Inc. v. Nu-Kote Int ' l , Inc. , 134 F.3d 1085 , 1088 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) ; see Sanofi-Synthelabo v. Apotex , Inc. , 470 F.3d 1368 , 1374 ( Fed.Cir.2006 ) ( taking into account the applicable presumptions and burdens in reviewing the grant of a preliminary injunction ) . Sandoz on this appeal relies on the Supreme Court 's decision in KSR International Co. v. Teleflex , Inc. , 550 U.S. 398 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 , 167 L.Ed.2d 705 ( 2007 ) , Sandoz arguing that the law of obviousness has been significantly changed , and that the district court did not give adequate recognition to the changed law . The district court had issued its initial decision granting the preliminary injunction shortly before the Court 's decision in KSR . The court then requested supplemental briefing and argument , and issued a further opinion discussing the issues in light of KSR and continuing to conclude that Abbott was likely to prevail on the merits of the question of obviousness . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In its initial decision the district court discussed the references in detail . The *1347 court explained that the PCT Application , entitled `` Controlled-Release Dosage Forms of Azithromycin , '' describes `` [ a ] dosage form for oral administration comprising azithromycin and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier , which releases not more than about 10 % of its incorporated azithromycin into a mammal 's stomach , and which releases not more than an additional 10 % during the first 15 minutes after entering said mammal 's duodenum , '' and exhibits decreased gastrointestinal side effects . The district court explained that the PCT Application shows hydroxypropylmethylcellulose ( HPMC ) and other polymers as `` a hydrophilic polymer sufficient to provide a useful degree of control over the azithromycin dissolution , '' and contains in vitro data showing the amount and timing of dissolution of azithromycin in various conditions and sustained dosage forms . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Sandoz argued that these teachings should be combined with those of the ¡¬571 Publication and the ¡¬190 patent entitled `` Controlled Release Formulation for Poorly Soluble Basic Drugs , '' which describes a `` controlled release solid pharmaceutical composition adapted for oral administration comprising : a therapeutically effective amount of at least one basic drug having a water solubility of less than 1 part per 30 parts water ... wherein the basic drug is a macrolide '' and as the release agent a water-soluble alginate salt . The ¡¬190 patent names the macrolides erythromycin , clarithromycin , dirithromycin , azithromycin , roxithromycin , and ABT-229 for use with the alginate salt release agent . Sandoz argued that the subject matter of the ¡¬718 patent would have been obvious in view of the ¡¬ 571 Publication showing extended release formulations of erythromycin derivatives , in combination with the controlled release formulations and pharmacokinetic properties of azithromycin in the PCT Application , and the modified release alginate salt formulation of clarithromycin in the ¡¬190 patent . Sandoz argued that a person of ordinary skill in this field would have desired to improve the administration of clarithromycin by finding an extended release formulation having optimum release and biological properties , and would have selected and tested the HPMC from the ¡¬571 Publication , in view of the formulation of azithromycin with HPMC in the PCT Application and the ¡¬190 patent 's use of an alginate salt to modify the release of clarithromycin . Sandoz stressed that the PCT Application states the known principle of using controlled release formulations to reduce the dosing frequency for short half-life compounds . Sandoz argued that no more than routine experimentation was needed to find a controlled release formulation that would meet the pharmacokinetic requirements stated in the ¡¬718 claims . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Sandoz applied similar arguments to the claims of the ¡¬616 patent , stating that the PCT Application teaches that control of azithromycin release reduces gastrointestinal side effects , and that the ¡¬190 patent shows the interchangeability of azithromycin and clarithromycin in the formulation using an alginate salt . Sandoz argued that this combination of references renders obvious a clarithromycin formulation with reduced gastrointestinal side effects as claimed in the ¡¬616 patent . In its supplemental argument based on KSR , Sandoz argued that Abbott merely `` pursue [ d ] known options '' for both the ¡¬718 and ¡¬616 patents , based on the Court 's exposition that : `` When there is a design need or market pressure to solve a problem and there are a finite number of identified , predictable solutions , a person of ordinary skill has good reason to pursue the known options within his or her technical grasp . '' KSR , 127 S.Ct . at 1742 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In the district court Abbott disputed the premises presented by Sandoz , challenged *1348 the analysis of the content and significance of the references , and argued that KSR did not hold , as Sandoz proposed , that the recognition of a problem of itself renders the solution obvious . Abbott argued that more is needed than recognizing the problem , as this court discussed in Cardiac Pacemakers , Inc. v. St. Jude Medical , Inc. , 381 F.3d 1371 , 1377 ( Fed.Cir.2004 ) ( `` Recognition of a need does not render obvious the achievement that meets that need ... . Recognition of an unsolved problem does not render the solution obvious . '' ) Abbott pointed out that the Court qualified its discussion by explaining that the `` problem '' should have `` a finite number of identified , predictable solutions , '' KSR , 127 S.Ct . at 1742 , to expose its eventual solution to unpatentability as `` obvious to try . '' Id . Abbott stressed the difference between new biological compositions whose performance and effectiveness in combination can not be confidently predicted but must be made and evaluated , and new mechanical combinations of known elements each of which predictably performs its known function in the combination . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Abbott stressed that its choice of extended release components is not shown or suggested by the prior art to produce the pharmacokinetic properties of Abbott 's claims . The Court recognized in Dennison Mfg . Co. v. Panduit Corp. , 475 U.S. 809 , 106 S.Ct . 1578 , 89 L.Ed.2d 817 ( 1986 ) that the district court is not to rely on hindsight , and that `` in addressing the question of obviousness a judge must not pick and choose isolated elements from the prior art and combine them so as to yield the invention in question if such a combination would not have been obvious at the time of the invention . '' 475 U.S. at 810 , 106 S.Ct . 1578 . In Graham v. John Deere Co. , 383 U.S. 1 , 86 S.Ct . 684 , 15 L.Ed.2d 545 ( 1966 ) the Court recognized that the obviousness inquiry must `` guard against slipping into use of hindsight and to resist the temptation to read into the prior art the teachings of the invention in issue . '' Id . at 36 , 86 S.Ct . 684 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Abbott agreed that the basic principles of pharmacokinetics were known , but argued that the limitations in the ¡¬718 claims , whereby the bioavailability of the product was characterized , were not shown as achieved in any reference or any combination of references . Abbott pointed out that the PCT Application is directed specifically to azithromycin and shows `` scores '' of possible formulations , all using in vitro data , and does not contemplate metabolite activity in vivo as is manifested for chlorithromycin . Abbott stated that `` the ¡¬422 publication discloses more than a dozen possible classes of delivery devices , '' Abbott Brief at 42 , that `` the ¡¬422 publication merely provides in vitro dissolution data for a subset of its disclosed compositions , '' and that the formulation in the PCT Application `` did not even have equivalent bioavailability as IR [ immediate release ] azithromycin . '' Id . at 41 , 86 S.Ct . 684 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Abbott described in the ¡¬718 and ¡¬616 specifications that the ¡¬190 patent reference presents `` C max values [ that ] are not statistically significantly different from those of the IR formulation . '' ¡¬718 patent , col. 2 , lines 11-12 ; ¡¬616 patent , col. 2 , lines 13-14 ( referring to Ser . No . 08/574,877 , the ¡¬190 patent ) . Abbott stated that Sandoz concedes that the ¡¬190 patent does not describe pharmacokinetic limitations based on clarithromycin plasma concentrations , and that neither the PCT Application nor the ¡¬190 patent discloses the pharmacokinetic limitations and properties set forth in the ¡¬718 and ¡¬616 claims , and that neither the PCT Application nor any other reference provides guidance as to which formulation would provide the pharmacokinetic characteristics required by the ¡¬718 claims . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Thus Abbott argued in the district court that a skilled artisan would not have known the effect of substituting clarithromycin *1349 for azithromycin in any specific formulation that might be selected from the PCT Application , for it is undisputed that there are significant differences among erythromycin derivatives . Abbott presented evidence to the district court that azithromycin and clarithromycin exhibit different properties in four biological processes of relevance to oral drug administration : absorption , distribution , metabolism , and excretion . These differences were tabulated by Abbott 's expert , Professor Stanley S. Davis , as follows : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Azithromycin _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Clarithromycin _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Absolute _NEWLINE_ Bioavailability _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ About 34 % from 600 mg dose _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ About 50 % from 250 mg dose _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Pharmacokinetics _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Linear _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Non-linear _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Active Metabolite _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ None reported in the _NEWLINE_ Physicians _NEWLINE_ Desk _NEWLINE_ Reference _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 14-hydroxy _NEWLINE_ clarithromycin _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Metabolism _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Metabolites possess little or no activity _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Extensively _NEWLINE_ metabolized to an active _NEWLINE_ metabolite _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Elimination Half Life _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ About 70 hours _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 3-4 hours for 250 mg IR dose ( 14-OH _NEWLINE_ metabolite , _NEWLINE_ 5-6 hours ) _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ First Pass Effect _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Not significant _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Extensive _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Volume of _NEWLINE_ Distribution _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Large-2200 _NEWLINE_ litre _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 250 litre _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Supplemental Declaration of Dr. Davis , February 7 , 2007 . The parties do not dispute that the PCT Application describes only in vitro data , and that in vitro data are not predictably transferable to in vivo conditions . Dr. Davis testified that `` it simply is n't the case that in vitro controlled release data will automatically correlate with the pharmacokinetic parameters in vivo , and in fact , for many of the formulations of the ¡¬422 application , they affirmatively do not so correlate . '' Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court concluded that a person of ordinary skill in this field would not have predicted which formulation , that might be selected from the prior art , would provide the required pharmacokinetics . The district court referred to the dissimilarities in the pharmacokinetic properties for azithromycin as shown in the PCT Application , considered the content of the ¡¬ 190 patent , and concluded that the bioavailability of the formulations claimed in the ¡¬718 patent were not predictable from these references . The court referred to the testimony of another Abbott expert , Dr. Daniel Weiner , that `` the ¡¬190 patent does not disclose any clarithromycin-specific PK [ pharmacokinetic ] data '' or `` any DFL [ degree of fluctuation ] 2 values at all . '' Declaration of Daniel Weiner , Ph.D. , January 9 , 2007 . Dr. Weiner explained that the pK values reported in the ¡¬190 patent are based on total antibiotic activity , which consists of the combined concentrations of clarithromycin and its active metabolite , while the pharmacokinetic elements of the ¡¬718 patent relate specifically to clarithromycin plasma concentrations . Dr. Weiner concluded , and the district court agreed , that a skilled artisan would not have had a reasonable expectation of producing effective compositions based on the mention of clarithromycin along with azithromycin in the ¡¬190 patent , because of their different mechanisms of antibiotic activity and the effect of this activity on pharmacokinetic behavior . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court observed that the in vivo azithromycin controlled release formulations in the PCT Application have less total bioavailability than their immediate release counterparts , supporting Abbott 's argument that the behavior of differing biological systems , even when structurally similar , is not predictable . See Alza Corp. v. Mylan Laboratories , 464 F.3d 1286 , 1297 ( Fed.Cir.2006 ) ( `` Alza 's evidence of in vitro dissolution *1350 rates is irrelevant absent evidence demonstrating that the in vitro system is a good model of actual in vivo behavior. '' ) . The district court concluded that the in vivo extended release properties claimed in the ¡¬718 patent are sufficiently dissimilar to or unpredictable from the in vitro controlled release data for azithromycin in the PCT Application that a person of ordinary skill in the field of the invention would not have had the degree of confidence of success in transferring the PCT Application 's azithromycin formulation to the different metabolic and solubility systems of clarithromycin as would render the ¡¬718 claimed invention unpatentable on the ground of obviousness . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In reaching these conclusions , the district court relied on the Federal Circuit 's decision on the same patents in Abbott Laboratories v. Andrx Pharmaceuticals , Inc. , 473 F.3d 1196 ( Fed.Cir.2007 ) ( herein `` Andrx '' ) . This court , sustaining the district court 's grant of a preliminary injunction , had concluded that obviousness was not likely to be established , reversing this court 's prior ruling reversing the grant of a preliminary injunction in Abbott Laboratories v. Andrx Pharmaceuticals , Inc. , 452 F.3d 1331 ( Fed.Cir.2006 ) ( herein `` Teva '' ) . Sandoz argued to the district court that the Federal Circuit 's ruling in Andrx is incorrect , and on this appeal Sandoz urges us to reject Andrx and reinstate Teva . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In Teva a panel of this court held that the claims of the ¡¬718 patent were likely to be held not infringed . This court also stated that there was a substantial likelihood that claim 4 of the ¡¬718 patent would be held invalid for obviousness based on the PCT Application together with the ¡¬190 patent . This court held that the preliminary injunction should be denied , although the panel cautioned that its ruling `` in no way resolves the ultimate question of invalidity . '' Teva , 452 F.3d at 1347 . In Andrx a later panel of this court , on an enlarged record , rejected the invalidity ruling in Teva and held that the ¡¬718 claims were likely to withstand the attack on validity . Andrx , 473 F.3d at 1203-07 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Reviewing this history as applied to Sandoz ' arguments herein , the district court explained that this court in Teva had not been made aware of the differences between the pharmacokinetic criteria described in the ¡¬190 patent and those of the ¡¬718 patent . The district court explained that the pharmacokinetic data in the ¡¬190 patent were based on measurements of total antibiotic activity in the body , which includes both clarithromycin and its active metabolite formed after ingestion , whereas the data in the ¡¬718 patent are specific to clarithromycin alone . The court found that `` Abbott has shown ... that the PK profile of the clarithromycin-metabolite data of the ¡¬190 patent formulation was not the same as the PK profile of the clarithromycin-only data utilized by the ¡¬718 patent , '' Abbott , 500 F.Supp.2d at 841 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Sandoz argued , in its supplemental briefing in the district court after the KSR decision , that this court 's decision in Andrx does not survive scrutiny under the principles set forth in KSR , and stressed that application of KSR renders it `` obvious to try '' the various release agents in the PCT Application , such that any successful composition would be unpatentable , whether or not the results were predictable . Sandoz argued that the ¡¬190 patent shows that clarithromycin and azithromycin have similarities as well as differences , and that it would be obvious to experiment to determine which formulations were effective in view of these differences and similarities . Sandoz stressed that the Abbott scientists had knowledge of the prior art including the PCT Application , and that they developed the Abbott formulation in only one month of research effort . Sandoz quoted the Court 's admonition in KSR that a *1351 court `` can take account of the inferences and creative steps that a person of ordinary skill in the art would employ , '' 127 S.Ct . at 1741 , and that `` [ t ] he combination of familiar elements according to known methods is likely to be obvious when it does no more than yield predictable results . '' Id . at 1739 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court , applying KSR , reconsidered its prior determination and framed the question as `` whether an ordinary person skilled in the art would have seen a benefit to combining an erythromycin derivative with a polymer with the same PK [ pharmacokinetic ] limitations as embodied in claims 1 and 4 of the ¡¬718 patent given the state of the pharmaceutical industry at the time . '' Abbott , 500 F.Supp.2d at 851 . The court concluded : `` Based upon what evidence and argument Sandoz offered , the answer was and remains no . '' Id . The district court explained that `` this Court 's preliminary factual findings ... found that Sandoz had not produced evidence indicating that the PK limitations were disclosed in the prior art or were inherent to the structural limitations of the prior art compositions . '' Id . at 852 . The district court observed that `` [ t ] he KSR opinion only focused on the Federal Circuit 's strict use of the TSM [ teaching , suggestion , motivation ] test in performing the obviousness analysis ; it did not mention or affect the requirement that each and every claim limitation be found present in the combination of the prior art references before the analysis proceeds . '' Id . at 852 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We agree that the obviousness of selection of components , when there is no prediction in the prior art as to the results obtainable from a selected component , differs from the issue in KSR , where the Court provided guidance that `` a court must ask whether the improvement is more than the predictable use of prior art elements according to their established functions . '' 127 S.Ct . at 1740 . The Court explained the conditions in which `` obvious to try '' may negate patentability , depending on the relation of the prior art teaching to the later-developed technology . The Court explained that when the problem is known , the possible approaches to solving the problem are known and finite , and the solution is predictable through use of a known option , then the pursuit of the known option may be obvious even absent a `` teaching , suggestion , or motivation '' concerning that option . Then , `` if this leads to the anticipated success , it is likely the product not of innovation but of ordinary skill and common sense . '' 127 S.Ct . at 1742 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Abbott argued that the `` known options '' in the prior art were not `` finite , identified , and predictable , '' the words of KSR , and are identified only with hindsight knowledge of Abbott 's new formulation and its pharmacokinetic properties . Abbott pointed to the discussion in the PCT Application of over a dozen possible drug delivery modes , including matrix systems , membrane-moderated or reservoir systems , osmotic pumps , coated hydrogel tablets and multi particulates , sustained release compositions with delayed-release layers , pH-dependent coated tablets , bursting osmotic core devices , bursting coated swelling core devices , pH-triggered bursting osmotic core devices , pH-triggered bursting coated swelling core devices , enzyme-triggered supported liquid membrane devices , bacterially degradable coating devices , and swelling plug devices , all classes of controlled release for drug delivery systems , each containing sub-classes and variations . PCT App . at 8-38 . The expert witnesses pointed out the difficulties in predicting the behavior of any composition in any specific biological system . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The evaluation of the choices made by a skilled scientist , when such choices lead to the desired result , is a challenge to judicial *1352 understanding of how technical advance is achieved in the particular field of science or technology . Such understanding is critical to judicial implementation of the national policy embodied in the patent statute . In Publication of Tomlinson , 53 C.C.P.A . 1421 , 363 F.2d 928 ( 1966 ) our predecessor court discussed the role of `` obvious to try '' in scientific and technologic research and in patentability : _NEWLINE_ Slight reflection suggests , we think , that there is usually an element of `` obviousness to try '' in any research endeavor , that is not undertaken with complete blindness but rather with some semblance of a chance of success , and that patentability determinations based on that as the test would not only be contrary to statute but result in a marked deterioration of the entire patent system as an incentive to invest in those efforts and attempts which go by the name of `` research . '' _NEWLINE_ Id . at 931 . The Court in KSR did not create a presumption that all experimentation in fields where there is already a background of useful knowledge is `` obvious to try , '' without considering the nature of the science or technology . The methodology of science and the advance of technology are founded on the investigator 's educated application of what is known , to intelligent exploration of what is not known . Each case must be decided in its particular context , including the characteristics of the science or technology , its state of advance , the nature of the known choices , the specificity or generality of the prior art , and the predictability of results in the area of interest . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court discussed the differences between the pharmacokinetic properties shown in the ¡¬190 patent reference and the properties in the ¡¬ 718 patent claims , the differences in the chemical and biological properties of azithromycin and clarithromycin , the differences between in vitro and in vivo data , and the differences between azithromycin and clarithromycin . For example , Abbott 's expert Dr. Davis stated that `` the absorption of clarithromycin is affected by a phenomenon know as the 'first pass effect ' which does not occur for azithromycin , '' and that azithromycin 's `` metabolism occurs only post-absorption . '' Dr. Davis also stated that `` the half-life for azithromycin is about 70 hours , whereas that for clarithromycin is about 3-4 hours at low IR doses . '' First-pass metabolism was explained as meaning that a significant amount of the drug is metabolized and converted into another compound before it enters the circulation ; Dr. Davis stated that a person of skill in this field , having this knowledge , would not have assumed that the two drugs would exhibit similar behavior if placed in the same formulation . The district court concluded that it was not predictable , from the in vitro behavior of azithromycin , how any specific clarithromycin extended release formulation would perform in vivo . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Sandoz presented other arguments , for example , that the FDA regulations state the requirements for approval of extended release formulations , thereby rendering obvious a formulation that meets these requirements . However , knowledge of the goal does not render its achievement obvious . The district court appropriately applied the KSR standard of whether the patents in suit represented an `` identified , predictable solution '' and `` anticipated success , '' the words of KSR , to the problem of producing extended release formulations having the pharmacokinetic properties in the claims . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On the record of the preliminary injunction proceedings , and considering this court 's ruling in Andrx and the guidance of the Court in KSR , we do not discern reversible error in the district court 's ruling that Abbott is likely to prevail on the *1353 issues of patent validity based on anticipation and obviousness . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ II _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ INEQUITABLE CONDUCT _NEWLINE_ Sandoz also argued that the ¡¬718 and ¡¬616 patents are unenforceable due to Abbott 's `` inequitable conduct '' in the Patent and Trademark Office . Sandoz stated that Abbott submitted a false declaration to the PTO , and also that Abbott withheld from the examiner the results of certain tests after the patent applications were filed and that were inconsistent with information in the patent applications . The district court found that there was no intent to deceive the examiner , and that the criticized activity did not constitute inequitable conduct . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The evidentiary standard for determining whether there was inequitable conduct in obtaining a patent that is otherwise valid was set forth by this court , sitting en banc for the purpose , in Kingsdown Medical Consultants , Ltd. v. Hollister Inc. , 863 F.2d 867 ( Fed.Cir.1988 ) . The court explained that `` [ t ] o be guilty of inequitable conduct , one must have intended to act inequitably , '' and held : `` Inequitable conduct resides in failure to disclose material information , or submission of false material information , with an intent to deceive , and those two elements , materiality and intent , must be proven by clear and convincing evidence . '' Id . at 872 . Mistake or negligence , even gross negligence , does not support a ruling of inequitable conduct . The court held : _NEWLINE_ We adopt the view that a finding that particular conduct amounts to `` gross negligence '' does not of itself justify an inference of intent to deceive ; the involved conduct , viewed in light of all the evidence , including evidence indicative of good faith , must indicate sufficient culpability to require a finding of intent to deceive . _NEWLINE_ Id . at 876 . When both materiality and deceptive intent have been established the district court determines , in the court 's discretion , whether inequitable conduct has occurred ; appellate review is on this basis . See id . at 876 ( `` As an equitable issue , inequitable conduct is committed to the discretion of the trial court and is reviewed by this court under an abuse of discretion standard . We , accordingly , will not simply substitute our judgment for that of the trial court in relation to inequitable conduct. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The ¡¬718 patent _NEWLINE_ Sandoz first challenges the district court 's findings with respect to a declaration by an inventor , Dr. Linda Gustavson , comparing the products of the pending ¡¬718 application with the products in a prior art Abbott patent , U.S. Patent No . 4,808,411 , directed to a pediatric clarithromycin suspension that is administered twice daily . Dr. Gustavson submitted data to the PTO comparing the ¡¬718 and the ¡¬411 formulations , and stated that `` the ER [ extended release ] formulation as claimed , is supported by the above results , namely , Cmax of clarithromycin in plasma is statistically significantly lower than that for IR [ immediate release ] formulation given twice daily . '' The declaration also stated that `` AUC is maintained over 24 hours ; and Cmin is substantially equivalent to that of the IR suspension '' .3 However , in this litigation Dr. Gustavson testified that she had not analyzed statistical significance , and that `` it could not definitively be concluded from the data that the difference between the ER Cmax and the Cmax for a twice-a-day dosed suspension would have *1354 been statistically significantly different . '' Based on this admission , Sandoz argued that the Gustavson submission to the PTO was a material misrepresentation , that intent to deceive is presumed , and that inequitable conduct was thereby established . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Abbott did not dispute that Dr. Gustavson did not analyze statistical significance , but argued that it was not material to patentability and that a reasonable examiner would not have found otherwise . Abbott pointed out that the actual data were before the PTO , and that the results did show a numerically lower Cmax value . Sandoz pointed out to the district court that Abbott 's patent attorney argued nonobviousness to the PTO based on the Gustavson declaration , and Abbott responded that the declaration correctly stated that the pharmacokinetic properties of the product in the ¡¬411 patent are markedly different from those of the product of the ¡¬718 patent . We have been directed to no evidence of deceptive intent , or `` bad faith or intentional misconduct '' , in the words of PTO Rule 56 ; on this appeal Sandoz repeats that deceptive intent should be inferred from the misstatement . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court cited Impax Labs. , Inc. v. Aventis Pharm. , Inc. , 468 F.3d 1366 , 1374 ( Fed.Cir.2006 ) for its summary that a ruling of inequitable conduct requires clear and convincing evidence that the applicant while prosecuting the patent `` ( 1 ) made an affirmative misrepresentation of material fact , failed to disclose material information , or submitted false material information , and ( 2 ) intended to deceive the [ PTO ] . '' In determining materiality , the district court applied the standard that `` [ u ] ndisclosed information is material if it satisfies 37 C.F.R . ¡± 1.56 and if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable examiner would have considered the undisclosed information important in deciding whether to allow the patent to issue . '' Although the Federal Circuit has not always been consistent in defining `` materiality '' in accordance with the PTO Rules , the principles are consistently directed to deceptive actions by patent applicants . In Digital Control , Inc. v. Charles Machine Works , 437 F.3d 1309 ( Fed.Cir.2006 ) the court observed that four separate tests have been applied for materiality . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court , applying the tests of materiality to the Gustavson statement about statistical significance , stated that it was `` obviously troublesome that Gustavson made her assertion without having actually performed the statistical test . '' The district court concluded that the Gustavson statement was not material to patentability , `` despite the fact that it satisfies the definition of 'material ' provided by 37 C.F.R . ¡± 1.56 ( b ) . '' The court stated that : _NEWLINE_ Since 1 ) no claim of the ¡¬718 patent requires the extended release formulation to have a statistically significant lower Cmax than the immediate release formulation ; 2 ) the data in fact shows the Cmax of the extended release formulation to be lower ( albeit not statistically significantly lower ) than the Cmax of the immediate release formulation ; and 3 ) the extended release formulation was in fact pharmacokinetically different from the immediate release suspension formulation , it is more likely than not that the PTO would not have found the `` statistically significantly lower '' statement to be important . _NEWLINE_ 500 F.Supp.2d at 822 . Relevant is the ruling in Regents of the Univ . of Cal . v. Eli Lilly & Co. , 119 F.3d 1559 , 1570 ( Fed.Cir.1997 ) ( that `` Information is material if a reasonable examiner would have considered it important to the patentability of a claim '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court also found that there was no evidence of intent to deceive the examiner . The court rejected Sandoz 's argument that deceptive intent is inferred *1355 from materiality alone , for precedent requires independent proof of deceptive intent . See Kingsdown , 863 F.2d at 872 ( intent to deceive the examiner into granting the patent is a separate and essential element of inequitable conduct in the PTO ) ; Baker Oil Tools , Inc. v. Geo Vann , Inc. , 828 F.2d 1558 , 1565 ( Fed.Cir.1987 ) ( `` The material facts upon which a holding of inequitable conduct rests relate to both the intent of the actor and the materiality of the information. '' ) . Weighing the materiality of the statement and the absence of evidence of intent to deceive , we do not discern an abuse of discretion in the district court 's conclusion that inequitable conduct was not established by the statement concerning statistical significance . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Sandoz next challenged the fact that Abbott did not provide to the patent examiner the results of some clinical tests conducted after the ¡¬718 patent application was filed , that were reported to the FDA and included on the Biaxin ( r ) XL product label . The test results relate to taste perversion4 results in a later clinical trial , and a study comparing clarithromycin with azithromycin . Sandoz stated that Abbott should have provided the patent examiners with these results and the product label , which report tests wherein the immediate release formulation has a lower incidence of taste perversion than the extended release formulation , contrary to the information in the ¡¬718 patent . Sandoz argued that the inventors knew or should have known of this discrepancy , and thus that intent to deceive is established . Abbott responded that the challenged taste tests were from dosages that were not directly comparable , and that they did not change the correctness of the data in the patent application . Abbott presented the expert testimony of Dr. Davis that `` the comparison between the taste perversion incidence rate for Biaxin ( r ) IR and Biaxin ( r ) XL in the label does not relate to the invention disclosed and claimed in the ¡¬407 patent , which is for a reduction in taste perversion for the same total dose . '' Supplemental Declaration of Professor Stanley S. Davis , February 7 , 2007 ( emphases in original ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court concluded that the taste results met the materiality criteria of Rule 56 but that a reasonable examiner would not consider the information important in deciding whether to grant the patent . The court explained that a reasonable examiner would compare data at comparable dosages , and that the data were not comparable . Although Abbott and Sandoz argued about whether the inventors knew or should have known of this discrepancy between this taste data from the Phase III clinical trial , and the taste data in the patent application , the district court observed that there was no evidence of deliberate withholding of this information in order to deceive the patent examiner . `` Intent to deceive can not be inferred solely from the fact that information was not disclosed ; there must be a factual basis for a finding of deceptive intent . '' Hebert v. Lisle Corp. , 99 F.3d 1109 , 1115 , 1116 ( Fed.Cir.1996 ) ( `` To establish inequitable conduct the information that is known to the applicant and not provided to the PTO must be both material to patentability , and withheld in order to deceive or mislead the examiner . `` ) ; Molins PLC v. Textron , Inc. , 48 F.3d 1172 , 1181 ( Fed.Cir.1995 ) ( `` While intent to deceive the PTO may be found as a matter of inference from circumstantial evidence , circumstantial evidence can not indicate merely gross negligence. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1356 Materiality is not evidence of intent , which must be established as a separate factual element of a discretionary ruling of inequitable conduct . The district court finding that the factual premises of both materiality and intent to deceive were not established in connection with the taste data , did not abuse its discretion in declining to find inequitable conduct on this ground . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Finally , Sandoz criticized Abbott 's failure to provide the PTO with a study designated W98-268 , done after the patent application was filed , which compared the pharmacokinetic values of clarithromycin upon administration under various conditions . The district court described the issue as : `` Abbott claimed that the mean DFL values for a modified release version of clarithromycin claimed by a prior patent , the ¡¬190 patent , were substantially equal to the mean DFL values for the immediate release version of clarithromycin '' but `` [ t ] he final report of Study W98-268 states that the modified release formulation exhibited a statistically significantly lower mean DFL than that for the immediate release formulation . '' 500 F.Supp.2d at 823 . Sandoz stated that Abbott committed inequitable conduct by failing to disclose these results to the PTO . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Dr. Weiner stated in his January 9 Declaration that `` the ¡¬190 patent does not disclose any clarithromycin-specific PK data , '' and `` the ¡¬190 patent does not disclose any DFL values at all , '' and explained that `` subsequent studies conducted by Abbott indicate that the commercial embodiment of the invention of the ¡¬190 patent does not have a statistically significantly lower DFL than the IR formulation ... . Before the present litigation , Abbott had conducted five crossover studies in which the pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin ( i.e. , clarithromycin specifically , not clarithromycin combined with its metabolite ) were measured for both the MR [ modified release ] and IR formulations : W95-914 , W95-195 , W95-197 , W98-268 [ the study that Sandoz accuses Abbott of withholding ] , and TAI-99-001 . '' The mean DFL values in Table VII in the ¡¬718 patent are based on Study W95-195 . See Supplemental Declaration of Dr. Ronald Sawchuk , February 7 , 2007 ( `` Table VII reflects data from a multiple dose study involving MR formulation and an IR formulation that was conducted in Germany in 1995 . See Ex . 12 , Study W95-195. '' ) . The studies conducted before the ¡¬718 patent application was filed showed the data reported in the specification . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Many details were explained to the district court , as to all the studies , their context , and their relationship . The district court found that `` contrary to Sandoz 's assertion , Study W98-268 does not demonstrate that the prior art MR formulation has the same PK properties as that claimed for the ER formulation . Therefore , Study W98-268 is not material to the patentability of the ¡¬718 patent . '' Abbott , 500 F.Supp.2d at 824 . The district court found that the ¡¬718 patent `` speaks of the PK relationship of extended release and immediate release formulations , not of modified release and immediate release formulations ... . [ and ] there is no evidence showing the DFL of the ER formulation to be anything but consistently statistically significantly lower than the DFL of the IR formulation . '' Id . The district court found that the W98-268 study was not material under either Rule 56 or the reasonable examiner standard . Clear error has not been shown in this finding . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On the preliminary injunction record , the district court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that Sandoz was not likely to succeed in establishing inequitable conduct in Abbott 's prosecution of the ¡¬718 patent application . We agree with the district *1357 court that the scales do not `` tilt towards finding inequitable conduct . '' Id . at 829 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The ¡¬616 patent _NEWLINE_ Sandoz argued that inequitable conduct as to the taste perversion claim in the ¡¬718 patent taints the ¡¬616 patent because a taste perversion claim was included in the ¡¬616 application when it was filed , although that claim was cancelled before any PTO examination on the merits . The district court declined to hold the ¡¬616 patent unenforceable based on a withdrawn claim , citing 37 C.F.R . ¡± 1.56 ( a ) : _NEWLINE_ Rule 56 ( a ) . The duty to disclose information exists with respect to each pending claim until the claim is cancelled or withdrawn from consideration , or the application becomes abandoned . Information material to the patentability of a claim that is cancelled or withdrawn from consideration need not be submitted if the information is not material to the patentability of any claim remaining under consideration in the application . _NEWLINE_ The district court deemed it `` wholly inequitable to hold a patent to be invalid for fraudulent conduct in the prosecution of a claim that was withdrawn before actual prosecution had even begun . '' Abbott , 500 F.Supp.2d at 829 . This court held in Scripps Clinic & Research Found . v. Genentech , Inc. , 927 F.2d 1565 , 1583 ( Fed.Cir.1991 ) that `` [ a ] reference that is material only to withdrawn claims can not be the basis of a holding of inequitable conduct . '' Rule 56 is in accord . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Sandoz also argued as to the ¡¬616 patent that Abbott did not report to the PTO the results of clinical trials conducted before the continuation in-part ¡¬ 616 application was filed . Sandoz ' expert Dr. Marcello Pagano , in his Declaration dated January 25 , 2007 , stated : `` I have reviewed the bronchitis and sinusitis studies [ and ] the claims of the ¡¬616 patent for a method of reducing gastrointestinal adverse side effects are not supported by the data from those two clinical studies . '' The results of these studies were provided to the FDA , but not to the PTO . Dr. Pagano stated : `` Since neither the sinusitis nor the bronchitis studies produced favorable results to support a claimed reduction in gastrointestinal adverse side effects , Abbott had to manipulate its data and report the number of discontinuations due to gastrointestinal adverse side effects to the PTO ... '' The district court found that the information from these clinical trials was not material to patentability , stating that : `` it is clear from both Table VI and Table VIII [ of the ¡¬616 patent ] that some data demonstrating no change in the subcategories of GI adverse side effects of abdominal pain , constipation , diarrhea , dyspepsia , flatulence and nausea were in fact disclosed to the PTO . '' Abbott , 500 F.Supp.2d at 828 . These findings have not been shown to be clearly erroneous . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ There was no evidence of intent to deceive with respect to the results of these clinical trials . Materiality , even if found , does not establish intent . This is not a case of new information that affects the fundamental invention ; this is a case of challenging every action or inaction of the `` conduct '' of patent solicitation , although patentability is unaffected . The purpose of Kingsdown was to bring patent practice into the mainstream of the law and administrative practice . The law severely punishes fraudulent practices , and the patent practice includes recognition that the inventor usually knows more about the field than does the `` expert '' patent examiner . However , routine actions that do not affect patentability and that are devoid of fraudulent intent are not subject to a different standard than other inquiries into fraudulent procurement . The Administrative Procedure Act governs patent examination , See Dickinson v. Zurko , 527 U.S. 150 , 119 S.Ct . 1816 , 144 L.Ed.2d 143 ( 1999 ) , *1358 and actions of patent examiners are reviewed with recognition of examiner expertise so well as recognition of the occasionally imperfect examination process . `` It was to mitigate the 'plague ' whereby every patentee 's imperfections were promoted to 'inequitable conduct ' that this court reaffirmed that both materiality and culpable intent must be established . '' Allied Colloids , Inc. v. American Cyanamid Co. , 64 F.3d 1570 , 1578 ( Fed.Cir.1995 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that the ¡¬718 and ¡¬616 patents were not likely to be held unenforceable based on inequitable conduct in obtaining the patents . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ III _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ INFRINGEMENT _NEWLINE_ The first step in most infringement suits is the procedure called `` claim construction , '' where the scope of the claim is defined by the court . At the preliminary injunction stage the district court 's claim construction is reviewed , as for other legal issues , for the likelihood of correctness of the ruling . This likelihood is based on the underlying facts as found at this stage of the proceedings , recognizing that `` the burdens at the preliminary injunction stage track the burdens at trial . '' Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal , 546 U.S. 418 , 429 , 126 S.Ct . 1211 , 163 L.Ed.2d 1017 ( 2006 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ For the patents here in suit , the issue of infringement was resolved , at this preliminary injunction stage , as a matter of claim construction . The dispositive question was whether the term `` pharmaceutically acceptable polymer '' is limited to the polymers named in the specification , or can include other pharmaceutically acceptable polymers . If so limited , it is likely that there would not be literal infringement ; if not so limited , then literal infringement would be possible . ( Infringement under the doctrine of equivalents was not addressed by the district court , although Sandoz argues the issue `` in an abundance of caution. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The meaning and scope of `` pharmaceutically acceptable polymer '' as used in these patents has been litigated in other cases , none of which had been finally decided , but some of which had been appealed to the Federal Circuit based on the grant of a preliminary injunction . The district court now construed `` pharmaceutically acceptable polymer '' in accordance with the construction by the Federal Circuit in Andrx , supra . Sandoz argues on this appeal that the correct construction is that of the Federal Circuit 's earlier decision in Teva , supra . Sandoz argues that because Teva was the earlier ruling , it could not be overturned by the later Andrx panel , citing Newell Cos. , Inc. v. Kenney Mfg . Co. , 864 F.2d 757 , 765 ( Fed.Cir.1988 ) ( `` Where there is a direct conflict [ between Federal Circuit panels ] , the precedential decision is the first. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Abbott responds that the decision in Andrx was properly followed by this district court , for in Teva the `` construction '' of `` pharmaceutically acceptable polymer '' was not at issue , and this court 's comment thereon was dictum . The court in Andrx recognized the non-binding nature of that comment in Teva . Indeed , the district court in Teva had stated that `` [ a ] t this early stage of the proceedings , the parties have raised no issue as to claim construction '' . Abbott Laboratories v. Andrx Pharmaceuticals , Inc. , No . 05 C 1490 , 2005 WL 1323435 , at *3 , *4 ( N.D.Ill . June 03 , 2005 ) ( Teva conceding literal infringement but challenging validity ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The panel in Andrx decided the questions now raised by Sandoz concerning the `` construction '' of `` pharmaceutically acceptable polymer '' and the pharmacokinetic requirements in the claims . The Andrx panel also explained its departure from the *1359 panel decision in Teva . The district court herein , applying Andrx , held that a person of ordinary skill in this field would interpret `` pharmaceutically acceptable polymer '' in terms of the following description in the ¡¬718 specification : _NEWLINE_ `` Pharmaceutically acceptable '' as used herein , means those compounds , which are , within the scope of sound medical judgment , suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower animals without undue toxicity , irritation , allergic response , and the like , in keeping with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio , and effective for their intended use in the chemotherapy and prophylaxis of antimicrobial infections . _NEWLINE_ ¡¬718 patent , col. 3 lines 40-47 . The district court referred to the ¡¬718 specification 's listing of pharmaceutically acceptable polymers , but applied the Andrx ruling that the polymers are not limited to those that are named in the following paragraph : _NEWLINE_ The pharmaceutically acceptable polymer is a water-soluble hydrophilic polymer selected from the group consisting of polyvinylpyrrolidine , hydroxypropyl cellulose , hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose , methyl cellulose , vinyl acetate/crotonic acid copolymers , methacrylic acid copolymers , maleic anhydride/methyl vinyl ether copolymers and derivatives and mixtures thereof . _NEWLINE_ '718 patent , col. 3 line 65 to col. 4 line 4 . The district court construed `` pharmaceutically acceptable polymer '' as : _NEWLINE_ [ A ] ny polymer , which within the scope of sound medical judgment is suitable for use in pharmaceutical compositions for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower animals without undue toxicity , irritation , allergic response , and the like , in keeping with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio , and effective for their intended use in the chemotherapy and prophylaxis of antimicrobial infections , and is capable of forming a matrix to extend drug release into the bloodstream . Such a `` pharmaceutically acceptable polymer '' must constitute 5 to 50 % by weight of the product . _NEWLINE_ Abbott , 500 F.Supp.2d at 834 . The district court , following Andrx , held that the usage `` from the group consisting of '' in the specification is not exclusive , as it would be in a Markush-form claim , and did not negate the broader description that is also contained in the specification , as quoted above . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This aspect was debated in the district court , and again on this appeal . Sandoz argues that since `` pharmaceutically acceptable polymer '' is limited by the specification to water-soluble hydrophilic polymers , and that since the listed methacrylic acid copolymers are known to include water-insoluble as well as water-soluble polymers , the term `` pharmaceutically acceptable polymer '' must be construed to mean that the formulation can not include any water-insoluble methacrylic acid or other polymer . The district court , receiving this argument , reasoned that `` the existence of water-insoluble polymers from the specifically-mentioned methacrylic acid co-polymer subset actually militates towards a broader construction urged by Abbott that would encompass water-insoluble methacrylic acid co-polymers . '' Abbott , 500 F.Supp.2d at 834 . Sandoz argues that this reasoning is flawed , and that this court in Andrx erred in rejecting this argument . However , we are not persuaded that the Andrx panel 's ruling warrants rejection on this argument , for we agree with the district court that the fact that some methacrylic acid copolymers are water-insoluble does not require limiting `` pharmaceutically acceptable polymer '' to the named polymers . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We conclude that the district court 's claim construction , which is that of Andrx , is correct , and that the district court properly *1360 declined to follow Teva . Sandoz ' argument that Teva was the correct construction and should be revived by the Federal Circuit is hard to square with Sandoz ' statement to the district court that `` a very important point to make here is Sandoz does not rely on the Federal Circuit opinion in the Teva case ... . Sandoz agrees with Abbott . '' Statement at the February 12 , 2007 preliminary injunction hearing , transcript at A11085 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Sandoz further argues that the district court erred by using the word `` matrix '' in its definition of `` pharmaceutically acceptable polymer , '' quoted above , pointing out that this word does not appear in the claims or specification . However , claim construction often calls upon words other than those of the patent , lest the claim simply define itself . `` Claim construction '' is for the purpose of explaining and defining terms in the claims , and usually requires use of words other than the words that are being defined . See Multiform Desiccants , Inc. v. Medzam , Ltd. , 133 F.3d 1473 , 1477 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) ( claims are construed as an aid to the decision-maker , by restating the claims in non-technical terms ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Abbott 's expert Dr. Davis had used the word `` matrix '' in his explanation of the technology of extended release . He explained that a `` pharmaceutically acceptable polymer ... alone or in combination with other polymers , is capable of forming a matrix when mixed with the drug to control and extend drug release into the GI tract and thence to the bloodstream . '' Declaration of Professor Davis , January 10 , 2007 . Sandoz does not dispute that this explanation comports with the description in the specification . Also , Abbott cites several scientific publications that use the word `` matrix '' in this context , and Sandoz does not argue that the word has a different meaning from that with which it was used by the district court . There is no ground for discarding the district court 's claim construction based on the word `` matrix . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Sandoz also argued that the claims must be construed so that the `` pharmaceutically acceptable polymer '' is the only release agent in the composition , argued that the presence of any other agent that affects release of the drug removes the composition from the scope of the ¡¬718 claims . Abbott pointed out that the claims use the conventional signal `` comprising , '' which means that other ingredients may be present in the composition , in addition to those explicitly set forth . See CIAS , Inc. v. Alliance Gaming Corp. , 504 F.3d 1356 , 1360 ( Fed.Cir.2007 ) ( `` In the patent claim context the term 'comprising ' is well understood to mean 'including but not limited to ' . `` ) ; Georgia-Pacific Corp. v. United States Gypsum Co. , 195 F.3d 1322 , 1327-28 ( Fed.Cir.1999 ) ( `` 'comprising ' ... is inclusive or open-ended and does not exclude additional unrecited elements or method steps '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Sandoz argues that the district court 's claim construction is incorrect because it ignores the distinction between `` pharmaceutically acceptable polymers '' and `` pharmaceutically acceptable excipients . '' We discern no support for this challenge . Abbott points out that the distinction between `` polymer '' and `` excipient '' lies in its role in the composition , as the patent states : `` The compositions of the invention further comprise pharmaceutically acceptable excipients and/or fillers and extenders , such as lactose ... '' . ¡¬718 patent , col. 4 , lines 21-23 . We discern no flawed judicial understanding of the term `` excipient . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Sandoz also argued that the components of its accused formulation are merely `` excipients '' in that they do not extend the release of the clarithromycin , while Abbott pointed out that Sandoz described its product to the FDA as `` extended release . '' *1361 Sandoz stated that the extension of release for its product is achieved not by the polymer that is present in its composition , but by other components . The district court considered the arguments concerning the role of the maltodextrin and the silicified microcrystalline cellulose in the Sandoz product . The court discussed the evidence of release rates and amounts released , including the information in Sandoz ' approved ANDA , the comparative data presented by both sides , and various technical articles provided by both sides on the physical and chemical characteristics of the components of the Sandoz formulation . The court found that `` Abbott has demonstrated a substantial likelihood that maltodextrin is a polymer that alone or in combination with other polymers , is capable of forming a matrix to extend drug release . '' Abbott , 500 F.Supp.2d at 837 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Sandoz argues that the district court erred in its evaluation of the evidence , stating that Abbott did not show by direct testing that any of the polymers in the Sandoz product actually extends the release of clarithromycin . Sandoz argues that the district court erred in finding unpersuasive certain laboratory tests conducted by Sandoz to show that maltodextrin has no significant impact on the dissolution rate of clarithromycin . Abbott responds that the district court did not err , and that Sandoz must be deemed to have admitted that maltodextrin and silicified microcrystalline cellulose are polymers that , alone or in combination with other components , are capable of extending drug release . Abbott pointed out to the district court that the developer of the Sandoz formulation , Dr. Nirmal Mulye , in his patent application ( U.S.2004/0224017 A1 ) entitled `` Process for Preparing Sustained Release Tablets , '' stated that `` the present inventor has found that the addition of maltodextrin in effective amounts provides the desired release profile , '' that `` maltodextrin also tends to slow down the release of a medicament in a controlled release formulation [ , ] '' and that `` the maltodextrin used in the present invention is to counteract the accelerated rate of release of the drug ... '' We have not been directed to clear error in the district court 's findings on this question . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Sandoz raises additional arguments , some discussed by the district court , and some newly presented on this appeal . All have been considered . We conclude that the district court 's findings and rulings at this stage of the proceedings have not been shown to constitute reversible error . The ruling that Abbott had shown a reasonable likelihood of proving infringement is sustained . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ IV _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ THE EQUITABLE FACTORS _NEWLINE_ Sandoz states that the district court incorrectly resolved and weighed the equitable factors relevant to the grant of a preliminary injunction . Sandoz states that the factors of irreparable harm , the balance of harms , and the public interest , all weigh in its favor , and outweigh any finding that Abbott is likely to prevail on the issues of validity or enforceability and infringement . The district court considered these factors , and explained its reasoning in exercising its discretion to grant the preliminary injunction . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Irreparable Harm _NEWLINE_ Sandoz argued that any harm to Abbott is not irreparable , for damages are available for infringement , if the eventual final judgment is adverse to Sandoz . Sandoz pointed out that the generic producers Teva and Ranbaxy are already in this market , by settlement with Abbott , such that any price erosion due to generic competition is already occurring . The district court considered these relationships , and *1362 concluded that they do not negate the market share and revenue loss upon Sandoz ' entry while the litigation proceeds . Precedent supports this conclusion . See , e.g. , Purdue Pharma L.P. v. Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH , 237 F.3d 1359 , 1368 ( Fed.Cir.2001 ) ( likelihood of price erosion and loss of market position are evidence of irreparable harm ) ; Bio-Technology Gen. Corp. v. Genentech , Inc. , 80 F.3d 1553 , 1566 ( Fed.Cir.1996 ) ( loss of revenue , goodwill , and research and development support constitute irreparable harm ) ; Polymer Technologies , Inc. v. Bridwell , 103 F.3d 970 , 975-76 ( Fed.Cir.1996 ) ( loss of market opportunities can not be quantified or adequately compensated , and is evidence of irreparable harm ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Balance of Hardships _NEWLINE_ The district court discussed and weighed the hardships argued by both parties , and found that the balance of hardships tipped in favor of Abbott . The court found that preserving the status quo preserves the current market structure , recognizing that Abbott has licensed other generic producers . The district court concluded that `` Abbott will lose much more if this Court did not enjoin Sandoz 's infringing conduct than if the Court enjoins Sandoz and it is subsequently found that the ¡¬718 patent is invalid or unenforceable . '' Abbott , 500 F.Supp.2d at 845 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We agree that the fact that a patentee has licensed others under its patents does not mean that unlicensed infringement must also be permitted while the patents are litigated . Precedent illustrates that when the patentee is simply interested in obtaining licenses , without itself engaging in commerce , equity may add weight to permitting infringing activity to continue during litigation , on the premise that the patentee is readily made whole if infringement is found . In this case the district court received Abbott 's argument that it could not be made whole if it prevails in this litigation , for the added erosion of markets , customers , and prices , is rarely reversible . See Sanofi-Synthelabo , 470 F.3d at 1383 ( rejecting hardship claim of generic challenger whose `` harms were almost entirely preventable ' and were the result of its own calculated risk to launch its product prejudgment '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Clear error has not been shown in the district court 's finding that the harm to Sandoz of delay in entering this market while this case is litigated , is outweighed by the harm to Abbott in view of the likelihood that Abbott will succeed in sustaining the validity and enforceability of its patents . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Public Interest _NEWLINE_ Sandoz argues that the public interest favors the availability of less expensive forms of successful medicines . The district court considered this argument , and stated : _NEWLINE_ The Court recognizes the public interest in competition in the pharmaceutical market . It also recognizes , however , the public interest in creating beneficial and useful products and the cost involved in that process . To the extent that this Court has found a substantial likelihood that the ¡¬718 patent is valid and enforceable , there can be no serious argument that public interest is not best served by enforcing it . _NEWLINE_ 500 F.Supp.2d at 846 . The district court appreciated that the public interest includes consideration of whether , by shifting market benefits to the infringer while litigation is pending for patents that are likely to withstand the attack , the incentive for discovery and development of new products is adversely affected . The statutory period of exclusivity reflects the congressional balance of interests , and warrants weight in considering the public interest . In Sanofi-Synthelabo , 470 F.3d at 1383 , this court referred to the significant *1363 `` public interest in encouraging investment in drug development and protecting the exclusionary rights conveyed in valid pharmaceutical patents . '' As the Court explained in Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp. , 416 U.S. 470 , 94 S.Ct . 1879 , 40 L.Ed.2d 315 ( 1974 ) : `` The patent laws promote this progress by offering a right of exclusion for a limited period as an incentive to inventors to risk the often enormous costs in terms of time , research , and development . '' Id . at 480 , 94 S.Ct . 1879 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Sandoz states that the Court 's recent decision in eBay Inc. v. MercExchange , L.L.C. , 547 U.S. 388 , 126 S.Ct . 1837 , 164 L.Ed.2d 641 ( 2006 ) negates any presumption of entitlement to an injunction upon a finding of likelihood that a patent will be sustained and found infringed . The district court did not apply such a presumption , but fully considered all of the legal and equitable factors . At the preliminary injunction stage , the legal and equitable factors may be of different weight when the patentee is itself engaged in commerce , as contrasted with a patentee that is seeking to license its patent to others . We need not resolve this aspect for all possible situations , for as between Abbott and Sandoz the district court objectively weighed the legal probabilities and the equities , and exercised its discretionary judgment as to the entirety of the cause . We have been shown no basis for believing that the district court abused its discretion . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ V _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ THE INJUNCTION BOND _NEWLINE_ Sandoz also appeals the amount of the injunction bond , which the district court set at $ 40 million . Sandoz provides no substance for appellate review of the amount of the bond , simply stating in its brief that it `` presented [ to the district court ] at least colorable evidence that its losses from the injunction and recall would be $ 200 million , '' but not describing the evidence or arguing its merits . Sandoz simply states that its proposed number should have been accepted , in the event that the $ 40 million is later shown to be inadequate . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This aspect has not been presented in reviewable substance . On this appeal , abuse of discretion has been shown in the district court 's setting of the terms of the injunction . See Russell v. Farley , 105 U.S. 433 , 441 , 26 L.Ed . 1060 ( 1881 ) ( the court 's discretion in setting the terms of an injunction is rooted in equity ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ VI _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ THE ISSUE OF CONFLICTING PRECEDENT _NEWLINE_ The district court found the likelihood that the patentee would succeed on the merits and that the equities favored the patentee , and exercised its discretion to enjoin infringement during the litigation . The dissent states that the district court applied the incorrect standard , and that if the infringer `` raises a substantial question concerning either infringement or validity , '' diss . op . at 1371 , it is an abuse of discretion to enjoin infringement pendente lite . The dissent quotes with approval a past panel statement that `` In resisting a preliminary injunction , however , one need not make out a case of actual validity . Vulnerability is the issue at the preliminary injunction stages , while validity is the issue at trial . '' Id . Indeed , this court 's precedent makes this statement , in direct conflict with other , earlier statements that the standard is not vulnerability , but likelihood of success on the merits . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In response to the arguments expounded in the dissenting opinion , I summarize the law governing the grant of a preliminary injunction . The criteria relied on in *1364 the dissent are not the criteria of any other circuit , nor of the Supreme Court . The correct standard is not whether a substantial question has been raised , but whether the patentee is likely to succeed on the merits , upon application of the standards of proof that will prevail at trial . The question is not whether the patent is vulnerable ; the question is who is likely to prevail in the end , considered with equitable factors that relate to whether the status quo should or should not be preserved while the trial is ongoing . The presentation of sufficient evidence to show the likelihood of prevailing on the merits is quite different from the presentation of substantial evidence to show vulnerability . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Thus the evidence that favors the patent must be considered in deciding a motion for a preliminary injunction , as well as the evidence against the patent . The trial court then decides which side is likely ultimately to prevail . The dissent presents only the case against the patent , apparently on the theory that this is all that is needed to raise a `` substantial question '' . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Indeed , a showing of a substantial question concerning validity or infringement can serve to avert judgment on the pleadings , or to avoid the grant of summary judgment , but it is not the same as showing likelihood of eventual success on the merits . The dissent recognizes that it is not the same and that it `` requires less proof '' , but errs in stating that this is sufficient to defeat the grant of a preliminary injunction . Precedent is clear that the standard is the likelihood of success of the plaintiff at trial , with recognition of the presumptions and burdens . See , e.g. , Gillette Co. v. Energizer Holdings , Inc. , 405 F.3d 1367 , 1370 ( Fed.Cir.2005 ) ; Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals. , Inc. v. Apotex , Inc. , 350 F.3d 1235 , 1239 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) ; Reebok Int ' l Ltd. v. J. Baker , Inc. , 32 F.3d 1552 , 1555 ( Fed.Cir.1994 ) ; Smith Int ' l , Inc. v. Hughes Tool Co. , 718 F.2d 1573 , 1579 ( Fed.Cir.1983 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Supreme Court precedent , every regional circuit , and controlling Federal Circuit precedent , apply to the preliminary injunction the combination of criteria that includes likelihood of success on the merits and equitable considerations . No other court has held that when the attacker has presented a `` substantial question '' on its side of the dispute-that is , more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance of evidence in support of its side-no injunction pendente lite is available . Further , equitable factors are of particular significance at the preliminary stage , where the question is whether to change the position of the parties during the litigation . See Camenisch , 451 U.S. at 395 , 101 S.Ct . 1830 ( the preliminary injunction preserves the position of the parties during the litigation ) . The dissent does not mention the equitable factors that were considered by the district court , as required by precedent ; the dissent simply states that the injunction must be denied if the attacker has raised a substantial question . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Supreme Court precedent is clear in stating that the same burdens and standards of proof apply in deciding the merits for preliminary injunction purposes , as in deciding the same questions upon full litigation . See , e.g. , Gonzales , 546 U.S. at 429 , 126 S.Ct . 1211 ( placing the burdens of proof for showing likelihood of success at the preliminary injunction stage ) . The Court explained in Amoco Production Co. v. Village of Gambell , AK , 480 U.S. 531 , 546 n. 2 , 107 S.Ct . 1396 , 94 L.Ed.2d 542 ( 1987 ) that : `` The standard for a preliminary injunction is essentially the same as for a permanent injunction with the exception that the plaintiff must show a likelihood of success on the merits rather than actual success . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1365 There is no reason why patent cases require unique treatment . See eBay Inc. v. MercExchange , L.L.C. , 547 U.S. 388 , 126 S.Ct . 1837 , 164 L.Ed.2d 641 . 394 ( 2006 ) ( `` [ T ] he decision whether to grant or deny injunctive relief rests within the equitable discretion of the district courts , and that such discretion must be exercised consistent with traditional principles of equity , in patent disputes no less than in other cases governed by such standards. '' ) . The general criterion of likelihood of success on the merits , in the context of the equities of the particular case , are uniform throughout the regional circuits . All are consistent with the rulings of the Supreme Court , and , although the words vary , all refer to the likelihood of the eventual outcome , not whether a substantial question has been raised . In brief sampling , starting with the First Circuit , the court summarized the standard in Wine and Spirits Retailers , Inc. v. Rhode Island , 418 F.3d 36 ( 1st Cir.2005 ) : _NEWLINE_ The sine qua non of this four-part inquiry is likelihood of success on the merits : if the moving party can not demonstrate that he is likely to succeed in his quest , the remaining factors become matter of idle curiosity . _NEWLINE_ Id . at 46 ( citation omitted ) . The referenced `` four-part inquiry '' is `` ( 1 ) the likelihood of success on the merits ; ( 2 ) the potential for irreparable harm [ to the movant ] if the injunction is denied ; ( 3 ) the balance of relevant impositions , i.e. , the hardship to the nonmovant if enjoined as contrasted with the hardship to the movant if no injunction issues ; and ( 4 ) the effect ( if any ) of the court 's ruling on the public interest . '' Id . ( alteration in original ) ( citations omitted ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Second Circuit also applies the standard four factors . I cite a case that emphasized the equitable considerations ; in Laureyssens v. Idea Group , Inc. , 964 F.2d 131 , 135-36 ( 2nd Cir.1992 ) ( emphasis in original ) the court stated : `` A party seeking a preliminary injunction must establish ( 1 ) irreparable injury and ( 2 ) a likelihood of success on the merits or a sufficiently serious question going to the merits and a balance of hardships tipping decidedly in the moving party 's favor . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Third Circuit also stated that the district court must consider four factors : `` [ A ] the likelihood that the applicant will prevail on the merits at final hearing ; [ B ] the extent to which the plaintiffs are being irreparably harmed by the conduct complained of ; [ C ] the extent to which the defendants will suffer irreparable harm if the preliminary injunction is issued ; and [ D ] the public interest . '' Opticians Ass ' n of Am . v. Independent Opticians of Am. , 920 F.2d 187 , 191-92 ( 3rd Cir.1990 ) ( alterations in original ) ( citation omitted ) . In Eli Lilly & Co. v. Premo Pharmaceutical Laboratories , Inc. , 630 F.2d 120 ( 3rd Cir.1980 ) the court explained that when analyzing a preliminary injunction : _NEWLINE_ the moving party must generally show ( 1 ) a reasonable probability of eventual success in the litigation and ( 2 ) that the movant will be irreparably injured pendente lite if relief is not granted ... . Moreover , while the burden rests upon the moving party to make these two requisite showings , the district court `` should take into account , when they are relevant , ( 3 ) the possibility of harm to other interested persons from the grant or denial of the injunction , and ( 4 ) the public interest . '' ... While these factors structure the inquiry , however , no one aspect will necessarily determine its outcome . Rather , proper judgment entails a 'delicate balancing ' of all elements . On the basis of the data before it , the district court must attempt to minimize the probable harm to legally protected interests between the time that the motion for a preliminary injunction *1366 is filed and the time of the final hearing . _NEWLINE_ Id . at 136 . Indeed , rulings of the Federal Circuit , along with requiring this `` reasonable probability of eventual success , '' have recognized the `` 'delicate balancing ' of all elements . '' See H.H . Robertson Co. v. United Steel Deck , Inc. , 820 F.2d 384 , 387-88 ( Fed.Cir.1987 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Similarly in the Fourth Circuit the inquiry is : `` 1 ) Has the petitioner made a strong showing that it is likely to prevail upon the merits ? 2 ) Has the petitioner shown that without such relief it will suffer irreparable injury ? 3 ) Would the issuance of the injunction substantially harm other interested parties ? 4 ) Wherein lies the public interest ? '' Blackwelder Furniture Co. of Statesville , Inc. v. Seilig Mfg . Co. , 550 F.2d 189 , 193 ( 4th Cir.1977 ) ( when reviewing the grant of denial of interim injunctive relief `` our review of the lower court 's application of the law is not limited by the same 'clearly erroneous ' rule which restricts our review of its findings of fact under Rule 52 ( a ) '' ) ; see First-Citizens Bank & Trust Co. v. Camp , 432 F.2d 481 , 484 ( 4th Cir.1970 ) ( applying the four-factors and reversing the district court 's grant of a preliminary injunction ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In the Fifth Circuit the four factors are recited as `` ( 1 ) a substantial likelihood that plaintiff will prevail on the merits , ( 2 ) a substantial threat that plaintiff will suffer irreparable injury if the injunction is not granted , ( 3 ) that the threatened injury to plaintiff outweighs the threatened harm the injunction may do to defendant , and ( 4 ) that granting the preliminary injunction will not disserve the public interest . '' Canal Authority of State of Florida v. Callaway , 489 F.2d 567 , 573 ( 5th Cir.1974 ) . The `` substantial likelihood of prevailing '' is not the same as raising a substantial question . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Again for the Sixth Circuit , the `` well-established '' factors are : `` ( 1 ) the likelihood that the party seeking the preliminary injunction will succeed on the merits of the claim ; ( 2 ) whether the party seeking the injunction will suffer irreparable harm without the grant of the extraordinary relief ; ( 3 ) the probability that granting the injunction will cause substantial harm to others ; and ( 4 ) whether the public interest is advanced by the issuance of the injunction , '' Six Clinics Holding Corp. II v. Cafcomp Systems , Inc. , 119 F.3d 393 , 399 ( 6th Cir.1997 ) . The court recognized that `` a finding that the movant has not established a strong probability of success on the merits will not preclude a court from exercising its discretion to issue a preliminary injunction if the movant has , at minimum , 'show [ n ] serious questions going to the merits and irreparable harm which decidedly outweighs any potential harm to the defendant if the injunction is issued . ' `` Id . at 400 ( alteration in original ) . This ruling gave weight to the court 's discretion to preserve the status quo during the litigation , when the equitable factors warrant such discretion . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In the Seventh Circuit : _NEWLINE_ As a threshold matter , a party seeking a preliminary injunction must demonstrate ( 1 ) some likelihood of succeeding on the merits , and ( 2 ) that it has `` no adequate remedy at law '' and will suffer `` irreparable harm '' if preliminary relief is denied . If the moving party can not establish either of these prerequisites , a court 's inquiry is over and the injunction must be denied . If , however , the moving party clears both thresholds , the court must then consider : ( 3 ) the irreparable harm the non-moving party will suffer if preliminary relief is granted , balancing that harm against the irreparable harm to the moving party if relief is denied ; and ( 4 ) the public interest , meaning the consequences of *1367 granting or denying the injunction to nonparties . _NEWLINE_ Abbott Laboratories v. Mead Johnson & Co. , 971 F.2d 6 , 11 ( 7th Cir.1992 ) . This court has observed that the standard for granting or denying a motion for a preliminary injunction is not unique to patent law , and has ruled that the standard of the regional circuit should apply , here the Seventh Circuit . See Mikohn Gaming Corp. v. Acres Gaming , Inc. , 165 F.3d 891 , 894 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) ( `` The Federal Circuit has generally viewed the grant of a preliminary injunction as a matter of procedural law not unique to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Circuit , and on appellate review has applied the procedural law of the regional circuit in which the case was brought. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In the Eighth Circuit , `` The relevant factors on a motion for a preliminary injunction are : ( 1 ) the probability of success on the merits ; ( 2 ) the threat of irreparable harm to the movant ; ( 3 ) the balance between this harm and the injury that granting the injunction will inflict on other interested parties ; and ( 4 ) whether the issuance of an injunction is in the public interest . '' Entergy , Arkansas , Inc. v. Nebraska , 210 F.3d 887 , 898 ( 8th Cir.2000 ) . In Shrink Missouri Government PAC v. Adams , 151 F.3d 763 , 764 ( 8th Cir.1998 ) the court stressed that `` [ t ] he most important of the [ preliminary injunction ] factors is the appellants ' likelihood of success on the merits . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Ninth Circuit stressed the importance of the equitable factors : `` Preliminary injunctive relief is available to a party who demonstrates either : ( 1 ) a combination of probable success on the merits and the possibility of irreparable harm ; or ( 2 ) that serious questions are raised and the balance of hardships tips in its favor . These two formulations represent two points on a sliding scale in which the required degree of irreparable harm increases as the probability of success decreases . '' Perfect 10 , Inc. v. Amazon.com , Inc. , 487 F.3d 701 , 713-14 ( 9th Cir.2007 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In the Tenth Circuit , `` To obtain a preliminary injunction , the moving party must establish that ( 1 ) the moving party will suffer irreparable injury unless the injunction issues ; ( 2 ) the threatened injury to the moving party outweighs whatever damage the proposed injunction may cause the opposing party ; ( 3 ) the injunction , if issued , would not be adverse to the public interest ; and ( 4 ) there is a substantial likelihood that the moving party will eventually prevail on the merits .

Cruce , 972 F.2d 1195 , 1199 ( 10th Cir.1992 ) ( `` When a party seeking a preliminary injunction satisfies the first three requirements , the standard for meeting the fourth 'probability of success ' prerequisite becomes more lenient .

'' CSX Transp . Inc. v. Williams , 406 F.3d 667 , 670 ( D.C.Cir.2005 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All of the circuits have placed the preliminary injunction in terms of the likelihood of success on the merits and equitable factors . No circuit has held that it suffices simply to raise a `` substantial question . '' Raising a substantial question achieves the threshold requirement of the well-pleaded complaint ; it does not demonstrate a likelihood of prevailing . See Christianson v. Colt Industries Operating Corp. , 486 U.S. 800 , 808-809 , 108 S.Ct . 2166 , 100 L.Ed.2d 811 ( 1988 ) ( `` A district court 's federal-question jurisdiction , we recently explained , extends over 'only those cases in which a well-pleaded complaint establishes either that federal law creates the cause of action or that the plaintiff 's right to relief necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of federal law [ . ] ' `` ) ( citation omitted ) ; Litecubes , LLC v.

That standard conflicts with precedent of the Supreme Court and all of the regional circuits , all of which require that likelihood of success on the merits be determined and weighed along with the equitable factors . It is not the law that raising a `` substantial question '' will `` negate the patentee 's likelihood of success . '' Diss . op . at 1372 . Raising a substantial question may avoid dismissal on the pleadings , but contrary to the view of the dissent , establishing that there is an issue for trial is not the same as establishing the likelihood of prevailing at trial . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court analyzed the positions of both sides as well as the equitable factors , decided that Abbott was likely to prevail on the merits and that the equitable factors weighed in favor of Abbott , and exercised its discretion to grant the preliminary injunction . The dissent states that a showing of `` vulnerability '' shows that the defendant is likely to prevail on the merits ; that is facially incorrect . The dissent also relies on some recent ( 2008 ) Federal Circuit decisions ; these decisions are not `` clearly established precedent , '' for they can not overcome earlier rulings of this court . Further , until today no opinion has equated the raising of a `` substantial question '' with a showing of likelihood of success on the merits . The following additional cases of the Federal Circuit are cited to show the established law : Jeneric/Pentron , Inc. v. Dillon Co. , Inc. , 205 F.3d 1377 , 1380 ( Fed.Cir.2000 ) ( `` A preliminary injunction requires the movant to show four factors ...

The district court 's findings of fact underlying the legal and equitable considerations are supported , and the judicial balancing of these considerations shows no abuse of discretion . The grant of the injunction is affirmed . The case is remanded for further proceedings.5 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ AFFIRMED _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ GAJARSA , Circuit Judge , dissenting . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I respectfully dissent from the court 's opinion . There is no legal basis for the granting of a preliminary injunction , and its issuance is an abuse of discretion . Although generally the denial or issuance of a preliminary injunction is within the broad discretion of the district court , the decision of the district court must be reversed when it abuses its discretion . See Cybor Corp. v. FAS Technologies , Inc. , 138 F.3d 1448 , 1460 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) ( en banc ) ( `` A district court abuses its discretion when its decision is based on clearly erroneous findings of fact , is based on erroneous interpretations of the law , or is clearly unreasonable , arbitrary or fanciful. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ `` A preliminary injunction requires the movant to show four factors : ( 1 ) a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits , ( 2 ) the prospect of irreparable harm , ( 3 ) a balance of the parties ' hardships in favor of injunction , and ( 4 ) no potential injury to an important public interest . '' See Jeneric/Pentron , Inc. v. Dillon Co. , 205 F.3d 1377 , 1380 ( Fed.Cir.2000 ) . When the district court considers the four factors , `` the likelihood of success factor plays a key role , '' id. , and that is the factor I will focus on in my dissent . Because of `` the extraordinary nature of the relief , the patentee carries the burden of showing likelihood of success on the merits , '' in light of the presumptions and burdens that will inhere at trial , with respect to the patent 's validity , enforceability , and infringement . Nutrition 21 v. United States , 930 F.2d 867 , 869 ( Fed.Cir.1991 ) ( emphasis in original ) ; see also Amazon.com , Inc. v. Barnesandnoble.com , Inc. , 239 F.3d 1343 , 1350 ( Fed.Cir.2001 ) . If the defendant `` raises a substantial question concerning either infringement or validity , i.e. , asserts an infringement or invalidity defense that the patentee can not prove 'lacks substantial merit , ' the preliminary injunction should not issue . '' Amazon.com , 239 F.3d at 1350-51 . This court has explained that : _NEWLINE_ In resisting a preliminary injunction , however , one need not make out a case *1372 of actual invalidity . Vulnerability is the issue at the preliminary injunction stages , while validity is the issue at trial . The showing of a substantial question as to invalidity thus requires less proof than the clear and convincing showing necessary to establish invalidity itself . _NEWLINE_ Abbott Labs . v. Andrx Pharms. , Inc. , 452 F.3d 1331 , 1335 ( Fed.Cir.2006 ) ( herein `` Andrx '' ) ( quoting Amazon.com , 239 F.3d at 1359 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The majority opinion postulates that the findings of the district court are correct . It is error to so conclude because the district court failed to properly consider and weigh the ample evidence produced by Sandoz that clearly established a substantial question of invalidity and rendered the patent vulnerable to an invalidity challenge at trial . Instead , the district court erroneously required proof of clear and convincing evidence of invalidity at the preliminary stages of the proceedings . As I explain below , this conflicts with our clearly established precedent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Under our precedent , the likelihood of success factor is properly analyzed by considering whether the alleged infringer raises a substantial question as to validity . See , e.g. , E.I . du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. MacDermid Printing Solutions , L.L.C. , 525 F.3d 1353 , 1358 ( Fed.Cir.2008 ) ( `` [ I ] f the accused infringer raises a substantial question regarding validity , the district court should find that the patentee has not shown a likelihood of success on the merits . '' ( internal quotation marks omitted ) ) . Indeed , this court has consistently held that an alleged infringer can negate the patentee 's likelihood of success on the merits-and thus defeat a preliminary injunction-by raising a substantial question as to validity . For example , in Genentech , this court explained : _NEWLINE_ In order to demonstrate that it has a likelihood of success , [ the patentee ] must show that , in light of the presumptions and burdens that will inhere at trial on the merits , ( 1 ) it will likely prove that [ the alleged infringer ] infringes the [ ] patent and ( 2 ) its infringement claim will likely withstand [ the alleged infringer 's ] challenges to the validity and enforceability of the [ ] patent . In other words , if [ the alleged infringer ] raises a `` substantial question '' concerning validity , enforceability , or infringement ( i.e. , asserts a defense that [ the patentee ] can not show `` lacks substantial merit '' ) the preliminary injunction should not issue . More specifically , with regard to [ the alleged infringer 's ] validity defenses , the question on appeal is whether there is substantial merit to [ the alleged infringer 's ] assertion that the [ ] patent claim [ is invalid ] . _NEWLINE_ Genentech , Inc. v. Novo Nordisk A/S , 108 F.3d 1361 , 1364 ( Fed.Cir.1997 ) . Our subsequent cases consistently applied the law as it was explained in Genentech . See , e.g. , Tate Access Floors v. Interface Architectural Res. , 279 F.3d 1357 , 1365 ( Fed.Cir.2002 ) ( `` In order to demonstrate likely success on the merits , [ the patentee ] must show that , in light of the presumptions and burdens applicable at trial , it will likely prove that [ the alleged infringer ] infringes the asserted claims of the [ ] patent and that the patent will likely withstand [ the alleged infringer 's ] challenges to its validity . If [ the alleged infringer ] raises a substantial question concerning infringement or validity , meaning that it asserts a defense that [ the patentee ] can not prove 'lacks substantial merit , ' the preliminary injunction issued improperly . '' ( internal citations omitted ; citing Genentech , 108 F.3d at 1364 and Amazon.com , 239 F.3d at 1350-51 ) ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Our most recent cases continue to adhere to the law as it was explained in Genentech . See , e.g. , *1373 Erico Int ' l Corp. v. Vutec Corp. , 516 F.3d 1350 , 1352 , 1354 ( Fed.Cir.2008 ) ( stating that `` [ the alleged infringer ] must show a substantial question of invalidity to avoid a showing of likelihood of success '' and vacating the preliminary injunction `` [ b ] ecause this court finds that [ the alleged infringer ] has raised a substantial question as to the validity of the patent at issue '' ) ; PHG Techs. , LLC v. St. John Cos. , 469 F.3d 1361 , 1365 , 1369 ( Fed.Cir.2006 ) ( explaining that `` in order to defeat the injunction on grounds of potential invalidity , [ the alleged infringer ] , as the party bearing the burden of proof on the issue at trial , must establish a substantial question of invalidity '' and holding the district court clearly erred in finding the patentee was likely to succeed `` because [ the alleged infringer ] has satisfied its burden of raising a substantial question of invalidity '' ) . Thus , under our clearly established precedent , when the alleged infringer raises a substantial question regarding validity , a preliminary injunction can not issue because the patentee has failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ While Section VI of the opinion contains a superfluity of citations , it does not state the law relevant to this case . It is a pleasant , ambulatory , and meandering discussion ; but it is not required to decide this case , is not part of the majority opinion , and is clearly dicta . Although Section VI discusses the relevant four-factor test and properly emphasizes the likelihood of success factor , it ignores the way this court has consistently analyzed whether or not a patentee has demonstrated it will likely succeed at trial . The real question before us in this case , as our precedent clearly explains , is whether the district court erred in finding that Sandoz had not established a substantial question as to the obviousness of the ¡¬718 patent . See , e.g. , Genentech , 108 F.3d at 1364 ( `` [ T ] he question on appeal is whether there is substantial merit to [ the alleged infringer 's ] assertion that the [ ] patent claim [ is invalid ] . '' ) . Sandoz has , in fact , raised and substantially established that the validity of the ¡¬718 patent is vulnerable , and on the record before us , Abbott failed to prove the invalidity defense `` lacks substantial merit . '' See Amazon.com , 239 F.3d at 1350-51 ( `` If [ the alleged infringer ] raises a substantial question concerning either infringement or validity , i.e. , asserts an infringement or invalidity defense that the patentee can not prove 'lacks substantial merit , ' the preliminary injunction should not issue. '' ) . Thus , the district court committed reversible error when it analyzed the likelihood of success factor and determined that Abbott had established it would likely succeed on the merits . In light of that error , I would vacate the preliminary injunction and remand for reconsideration and reweighing of the injunctive factors . Moreover , various additional legal errors taint the district court 's decision . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I . _NEWLINE_ The district court 's grant of a preliminary injunction rested on only two claims , claims 1 and 4 of the ¡¬718 patent . Claim 1 reads : _NEWLINE_ a pharmaceutical composition for extended release of an erythromycin derivative in the gastrointestinal environment , comprising _NEWLINE_ an erythromycin derivative and _NEWLINE_ from about 5 [ % ] to about 50 % by weight of a pharmaceutically acceptable polymer1 , so that when ingested orally , *1374 the composition induces statistically significantly lower mean fluctuation index [ DFL ] in the plasma than an immediate release composition of the erythromycin derivative while maintaining bioavailability substantially equivalent to that of the immediate release composition of the erythromycin derivative . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ¡¬718 Patent , col.11 ll.28-38 . Claim 4 similarly claims an erythromycin derivative and `` from about 5 [ % ] to about 50 % by weight of a pharmaceutically acceptable polymer '' but has different PK parameters . Id . col. 11 ll.48-58 . Claim 2 and claim 3 are dependant claims of claim 1 . Claim 2 claims `` the pharmaceutical composition of claim 1 , wherein the polymer is a hydrophilic water-soluble polymer . '' Id . col.11 ll.39-40 . Claim 3 claims `` the pharmaceutical composition of claim 2 , wherein the polymer is selected from the group consisting of polyvinylpyrrolidine , hydroxypropyl cellulose , hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose , methyl cellulose , vinyl acetate/crotonic acid copolymers , methacrylic acid copolymers , maleic anhydride/methyl vinyl ether copolymers and derivatives and mixtures thereof . '' Id . col. 11 ll.41-47 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Claims 1 and 4 of the ¡¬718 patent have three basic limitations : ( a ) an erythromycin derivative ; ( b ) 5 % to 50 % by weight of a pharmaceutically acceptable polymer ; and ( c ) various PK parameters . In the preferred embodiment , the erythromycin derivative is clarithromycin and the pharmaceutically acceptable polymer is HPMC at 10 % to 30 % by weight of the composition . Claim 4 requires PK parameters be such that `` upon oral ingestion , maximum peak concentrations of the erythromycin derivative are lower than those produced by an immediate release pharmaceutical composition , and [ AUC ] and the minimum plasma concentration are substantially equivalent to that of the immediate release pharmaceutical composition . '' Id . col.11 ll.52-58 . Claim 1 achieves similar results with slightly different parameters . For claim 1 , the composition must have a `` statistically significantly lower mean fluctuation index , '' DFL , which is defined in the specification as DFL = ( Cmax ? Cmin / CAv ) , id . col.3 ll.29-30 , and substantially equivalent bioavailability , which the district court found meant that the `` [ ER ] AUC values must be between 80 % to 125 % within a 90 % confidence level as compared to the immediate release composition AUC values . `` 2 Abbott Labs . v. Sandoz , Inc. , 500 F.Supp.2d 807 , 831 ( N.D.Ill.2007 ) ( herein `` Sandoz I `` ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ II . _NEWLINE_ Sandoz based its obviousness arguments primarily on three prior art references , which it argues combined with common sense and the ordinary skill of the art at the time make the ¡¬718 patent anticipated or obvious . First , Sandoz argues that the PTC Application WO 95/30422 ( `` the ¡¬422 publication '' ) filed by Pfizer , discloses a controlled release dosage form of azithromycin , which like clarithromycin is an erythromycin derivative.3 According to the disclosure , these controlled released compositions operate to release the drug substantially slower than the immediate release *1375 versions to reduce GI side effects . And , as Sandoz points out , the controlled release compositions disclosed in the ¡¬422 publication include a hydrophilic polymer composition of azithromycin , with a preferred embodiment being a matrix tablet containing 15 % to 35 % HPMC . Second , Sandoz noted that the ¡¬190 patent owned by Abbott discloses and claims controlled release compositions of clarithromycin in an ( non-polymer ) alginate matrix which are administered once a day and have slowed absorption such that they are bioequivalent with the current immediate release twice-a-day compositions and maintain therapeutic levels at 24 hours after ingestion . Claim 14 of the ¡¬190 patent also claims other marolides including azithromycin.4 Third , Sandoz argues that the ¡¬571 publication , filed by Eli Lilly , discloses sustained release formulations for antimicrobial agents including clarithromycin , which contain an active agent , namely a hydrophilic polymer such as HPMC , and an acrylic polymer . According to the specification , these formulations differ from the prior art that uses just hydrophilic polymers in that they are designed to allow a constant rate of release throughout the GI tract . In particular , the ¡¬571 publication disclosed using from about 5 % to about 29 % by weight hydrophilic polymer , and about 0.5 % to about 25 % by weight acrylic polymer , with the total weight of the two polymers not exceeding 30 % by weight . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In addition to challenging the validity of the ¡¬718 patent based on the ¡¬190 patent , the ¡¬422 publication and the ¡¬571 publication , Sandoz also relies on various evidence that the PK parameters specified in the ¡¬718 patent were well known in the art and would have been sought by anyone designing a controlled release formulation . Most strikingly , the testimony of one of the inventors named on the ¡¬718 patent , Linda Gustavson , an Abbott employee , supports the Sandoz position . In particular , Gustavson testified as follows : _NEWLINE_ Q : Did you tell [ the formulations department ] what pharmacokinetic parameters there should be ? _NEWLINE_ A : I mean , not specific numbers , but relative to the IR , yes . I told at least Sue that what we needed was *1376 a lower Cmax , an AUC that met FDA requirements for bioequivalence and a Cmin that was at least comparable to the IR . _NEWLINE_ Q : And where did you get these parameters ? _NEWLINE_ ... _NEWLINE_ A : A few years of experience , I guess . They 're the-I mean certainly the Cmax and AUC are very basic PK parameters determined in virtually every study that has pharmacokinetics . Cmin [ ] might or might not be important depending upon the drug you were talking about and what part of the pharmacokinetics you though might be associated with efficacy or safety . For clarithromycin , there was some thought that keeping the concentrations above some minimum level might be at least in part important to maintaining effectiveness efficacy . _NEWLINE_ Q : Would you say that these PK parameters were pretty much known in the art ? _NEWLINE_ A : Absolutely , yes . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Furthermore , Sandoz submitted references from 1983 ( over a decade before the ¡¬ 718 application was submitted ) , which explained , inter alia , that the `` objectives and possible advantages of controlled release dosage '' forms included `` maintain [ ing ] therapeutic drug levels , '' `` reduc [ ing ] dosing frequency , '' `` reduc [ ing ] fluctuations in drug levels , '' and `` reduc [ ing ] side effects . '' And the reference explained that the `` essence of controlled drug release '' was to `` obtain prolonged circulating drug levels with less fluctuation compared to conventional dosage forms , and to achieve these with less frequent drug administration . '' They also submitted references showing that HPMC was considered the `` controlled release agent of choice '' in the field . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court , writing prior to KSR , found that , despite this Court 's decision in Andrx to the contrary , claims 1 and 4 of the ¡¬718 patent were not obvious ( at least based on the preliminary record ) . The trial court 's finding rested on the fact that , contrary to this court 's conclusion in Andrx , new evidence established that the ¡¬190 patent , the ¡¬571 publication , and the WO ¡¬422 publication did not disclose the specific PK limitations of the ¡¬718 patent . The court recognized that `` [ g ] enerally , a showing that there is an established structural relationship between a prior art composition and the claimed composition demonstrates a prima facie case of obviousness . '' Sandoz I , 500 F.Supp.2d at 840 . See In re Dillon , 919 F.2d 688 , 692 ( Fed.Cir.1990 ) ( en banc ) ( `` [ S ] tructural similarity between claimed and prior art subject matter , proved by combining references or otherwise , where the prior art gives reason or motivation to make the claimed compositions , creates a prima facie case of obviousness. '' ) . Still , the court concluded that Abbott had preliminarily rebutted this showing by showing the specific PK properties embodied in the claims were unobvious . The trial court found that `` [ t ] o succeed on its obvious [ ness ] claim , Sandoz must produce evidence indicating that the PK limitations were disclosed in the prior art or were at the very least inherent to the structural limitations of the prior art compositions . '' Sandoz I , 500 F.Supp.2d at 840 . Sandoz , the court found , had not done so . Id . Moreover , the trial court found that `` because the ¡¬190 prior art does not disclose the [ specific ] PK profile of the ¡¬718 patent , a person skilled in the art would not be motivated to look at the WO ¡¬422 publication and interchange clarithromycin for azithromycin . '' Id . at 841 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Subsequently , the district court denied Sandoz 's motion for a stay of the preliminary injunction pending appellate review in light of the just issued KSR opinion . The court held that under KSR it was still *1377 necessary to `` demonstrate the presence of all claim limitations in the prior art '' and that Sandoz had not produced evidence indicating that the PK limitations were disclosed in the prior art or inherent to the structural limitations of the prior art compositions . Abbott Labs . v. Sandoz , 500 F.Supp.2d 846 , 851-53 ( N.D.Ill.2007 ) . According to the district court , it thus had not and did not need to reach the TSM test ( or any change in the application of this test brought on by KSR ) . Id . at 853 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On appeal , there is no real dispute that the ¡¬571 publication expressly discloses a `` sustained release matrix formulation in tablet form comprising ... erythromycin '' and containing from about 5 % by weight to about 29 % by weight of a hydrophilic polymer , thus meeting all of the structural limitations of the ¡¬ 718 claims . Moreover , the prior art clearly disclosed sustained release versions of clarithromycin and creating extended release formulations of erythromycin derivatives using polymers , preferably HPMC . And evidence shows that the desirability of the PK parameters claimed were well known in the art . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In light of this evidence , Sandoz raised a substantial question as to the obviousness of the ¡¬718 patent . The district court 's decision to the contrary constituted an abuse of discretion . First , it was clearly error to find , as a matter of law , that since none of the prior art references cited by Sandoz explicitly disclosed a composition that had the PK limitations of the ¡¬ 718 patent , it had failed to demonstrate `` the presence of all claim limitations in the prior art , '' and therefore that the ¡¬718 invention could not be obvious . Contrary to the majority , this holding relies on an improperly limited view of what types of references can be combined to show obviousness and an impermissibly cramped view of the Supreme Court 's holding in KSR . There is no absolute requirement that each claim limitation be disclosed in a prior art reference . See , e.g. , Takeda Chem . Indus . v. Alphapharm Pty. , Ltd. , 492 F.3d 1350 , 1356 ( Fed.Cir.2007 ) ( `` We have held that structural similarity between claimed and prior art subject matter , proved by combining references or otherwise , where the prior art gives reason or motivation to make the claimed compositions , creates a prima facie case of obviousness . '' ( emphasis added ) ) ; Tegal Corp. v. Tokyo Electron Am. , Inc. , 257 F.3d 1331 , 1349 ( Fed.Cir.2001 ) ( acknowledging that a claim could be obvious over a single prior art reference that does not disclose one of the limitations in the claim ) . Rather , in all cases , the touchstone of the analysis is whether the `` differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains . '' 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 ; KSR Int ' l Co. v. Teleflex Inc. , 550 U.S. 398 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 , 1734 , 167 L.Ed.2d 705 ( 2007 ) ; see also Takeda , 492 F.3d at 1357 ( explaining that `` in cases involving new chemical compounds '' to show a prima facie case of obviousness one must `` identify some reason that would have led a chemist to modify a known compound in a particular manner '' ( emphasis added ) ) . Thus , a given claim limitation may be obvious over the prior art even if no single reference had specifically disclosed that limitation . Moreover , even assuming an absolute rule that to be obvious a claim must be a combination of elements disclosed in the prior art , that standard was met here . As the Supreme Court reiterated in KSR , `` inventions in most , if not all , instances rely upon building blocks long since uncovered , and claimed discoveries almost of necessity will be combinations of what , in some sense , is already known . '' 127 S.Ct . at 1741 . In other words , it is the rare invention that is not a *1378 combination of prior art elements.5 And this is not one of such rare cases . Whether or not the prior art disclosed compounds displaying the particular PK parameters in the ¡¬ 718 patent , Sandoz did provide evidence suggesting that the PK parameters disclosed in the ¡¬718 patent were absolutely known in the art and that the prior art established that they were desirable in an extended release formula ( and indeed , that at least the AUC equivalence and lower Cmax were most likely essential to an extended release formula , at least one that would be approved by the FDA ) . This is sufficient to show that the claims might be a combination of elements previously known in the art . The prior art on record disclosing the PK limitations is of course further removed from the invention than , for example , a patent that disclosed a related drug formulation with the same PK limitations as the ¡¬718 patent . But while this may well make the former less likely than the latter to make the ¡¬718 patent claims obvious , there is nothing as a matter of law that prevents the invention from being considered an obvious combination of the prior art teachings contained in the current preliminary record . Cf . Aventis Pharma Deutschland GmbH v. Lupin , Ltd. , 499 F.3d 1293 , 1301 ( Fed.Cir.2007 ) ( explaining that while it is necessary for there to be `` some articulated reasoning with some rational underpinning to support the legal conclusion of obviousness ... such reasoning need not seek out precise teachings directed to the specific subject matter of the challenged claim '' ( internal quotation marks omitted ) ) .6 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Second , it is not dispositive that Abbott was not absolutely certain that using the formulations disclosed in the ¡¬422 patent would create a formulation with the desired PK parameters . Even before KSR , this court 's `` case law [ was ] clear that obviousness can not be avoided simply by a showing of some degree of unpredictability in the art so long as there was a reasonable probability of success . '' Pfizer , 480 F.3d at 1364 . And as the Supreme Court stated in KSR , `` [ w ] hen there is a design need or market pressure to solve a problem and there are a finite number of identified , predictable solutions , a person of ordinary skill has good reason to pursue the known options within his or her technical grasp . If this leads to the anticipated success , it is likely the product not of innovation but of ordinary skill and common sense . '' 127 S.Ct . at 1742 ( `` One of the ways in which a patent 's subject matter can be proved obvious is by noting that there existed at the time of invention a known problem for which there was an obvious solution encompassed by the patent claims. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1379 Third , the long standing precedent of this court and our predecessor , recently highlighted and relied upon in Pfizer is that `` discovery of an optimum value of a variable '' in a known process or composition is `` usually obvious . '' 480 F.3d at 1368 ( citing In re Peterson , 315 F.3d 1325 , 1330 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) ; In re Boesch , 617 F.2d 272 , 276 ( CCPA 1980 ) ; In re Aller , 42 C.C.P.A . 824 , 220 F.2d 454 , 456 ( 1955 ) ) . Accordingly , in Pfizer , for example , the court found that the optimization of a pharmaceutical compound to determine which acid salt was best was obvious , where `` the prior art heavily suggests the particular anion used to form the salt . '' Id . Similarly , here , if the PK parameters claimed were well known , and only routine experimentation by someone skilled in the art would have been necessary , in light of the HPMC formulations disclosed by the ¡¬422 publication and ¡¬571 publication , to create an ER clarithromycin-HPMC formulation with the claimed PK parameters , this would be sufficient to create a prima facie case of obviousness . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Accordingly , the district court erred in concluding that the fact that the ¡¬ 422 publication and ¡¬190 patent did not disclose the PK limitations of the asserted claims precluded a finding of obviousness . This legal error constitutes an abuse of discretion . And contrary to the holding of the district court , Sandoz has raised a `` substantial question concerning '' the obviousness of the asserted claims . On this basis , I would reverse the decision of the district court . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ III . _NEWLINE_ Sandoz also argues that several acts by Abbott during the prosecution of its patent application constitute inequitable conduct and , thus , show that the district court abused its discretion in not rejecting the motion for a preliminary injunction based on the likelihood that the patents would be declared unenforceable . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Patent Examiner initially rejected the claims of the ¡¬718 application and requested that Abbott show that one of its prior art compositions of clarithromycin , which was described as an immediate release pediatric suspension formula , did not have the same extended release properties as Abbott 's claimed invention . In response , Abbott submitted a declaration by Linda Gustavson stating that the Cmax of the ER clarithromycin `` is statistically significantly lower than that for IR formulation given twice daily . '' J.A . 10015 . Abbott now admits that this statement was incorrect-that the data Gustavson relied on did not show a statistically significant lowering of the Cmax-but only a non-statistically significant apparent lowering , and Gustavson herself admits that she never performed any statistical analysis of the data and would not have known how to do it . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court found that the concededly false statement was immaterial since all the Examiner asked was whether the two products have the same PK properties . According to the district court , `` [ g ] iven the accuracy of the ultimate conclusion-that the extended release formulation was indeed different from the immediate release suspension formulation , Gustavson 's declaration of a 'statistically significantly lower ' Cmax is immaterial despite the fact that it satisfies the definition of 'material ' provided by 37 C.F.R . ¡± 1.56 ( b ) . '' Sandoz I , 500 F.Supp.2d at 822 . The district court reasoned that despite meeting the standard for materiality of ¡± 1.56 ( b ) a reasonable examiner would not have considered the statement important . Moreover , the district court emphasized that no claim of the ¡¬718 patent requires the extended release formulation to have a statistically significant lower Cmax than the immediate release formulation . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1380 The Gustavson statement was material , or more to the point , there is substantial likelihood that Sandoz would be able to so establish at the merits stage . First , contrary to the erroneous conclusion of the district court , we have held that `` all misstatements or admissions that satisfy [ 37 C.F.R . ¡± 1.56 ( b ) ] are considered material . '' Monsanto Co. v. Bayer Bioscience N.V. , 514 F.3d 1229 , 1237 n. 11 ( Fed.Cir.2008 ) . In addition , while no claim element in the ¡¬718 patent specifically states that the Cmax value must be statistically significantly lower , it does require Cmax values that are `` lower '' than in the immediate release formulation . Despite the fact that in other claim elements Abbott uses the term `` statistically significantly lower , '' it is far from clear that one can establish that the Cmax value is lower if the data does not show a statistically significant difference , which by definition , as ordinarily understood , means that the data can not conclusively establish that there is a real difference . This court previously recognized that `` there is little in the [ ¡¬718 ] patent itself that establishes the differences ( if any ) between parameters that are simply 'lower ' rather than 'statistically significantly lower . ' `` Andrx , 452 F.3d at 1339 n. 4 . Moreover , regardless of the claim construction , it would be important ( if not dispositive ) to a reasonable examiner to know that Abbott did not have data which showed a lower Cmax to any statistical significance over the structurally similar prior art suspension formulas in deciding whether to allow the claim over this prior art . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On this basis alone , the district court abused its discretion because it created such a high bar for materiality that in essence no statement or withholding of information would be material if it would not change the ultimate outcome of allowing the patent . This is inconsistent with our precedent . See , e.g. , Hoffmann-La Roche , Inc. v. Promega Corp. , 323 F.3d 1354 , 1368 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) ( `` The fact that the examiner did not have to rely on the purity representations in issuing the patent is not inconsistent with a finding of materiality . Although the inventors ' statements regarding purity were not the principal focus of the office action response , they were clearly an important aspect of it . Under the circumstances , a reasonable examiner would have wanted to know that the patentability argument based on purity was unsupported by the experimental results cited by the inventors . '' ( internal citation omitted ) ) ; Merck & Co. v. Danbury Pharmacal , Inc. , 873 F.2d 1418 , 1421 ( Fed.Cir.1989 ) ( rejecting a `` but for '' standard of materiality ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In addition , while the district court did not reach the issue of intent , the fact that Gustavson submitted a declaration to the PTO in which she claimed to have found a statistically significant lowering of Cmax despite now admitting to never having done any statistical analysis is sufficient circumstantial evidence of intent to raise a substantial question of inequitable conduct , if not necessarily to prove inequitable conduct on the merits . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court also found that the failure by Abbott to disclose a new study7 *1381 was immaterial because Abbott simply `` chose to rely on the results of several other studies that showed differing mean DFL values '' and the totality of the evidence demonstrates that the prior art formulation did not have the `` same broad PK properties as those claimed for the ER formulation . '' Sandoz I , 500 F.Supp.2d at 824 . The test is not whether the Examiner would have refused to allow the patent to issue without the information , but just whether it would have been `` important '' to her consideration . Here the extent the PK parameters of the ER formulation differed from the clarithromycin formulations in the prior art was the primary focus of the examiner 's concerns regarding patentability , and Abbott 's ability to establish sufficient differences was the basis for allowing the claims . It was not for Abbott to decide unilaterally that it preferred the results of one set of studies that supported patentability and therefore could ignore studies reaching the opposite result . Cf . Paragon Podiatry Lab . v. KLM Labs. , 984 F.2d 1182 , 1193 ( Fed.Cir.1993 ) ( finding inequitable conduct for failure to disclose sales data and noting that `` where the decision of whether or not to disclose sales before the critical date is close , the case should be resolved by disclosure , not by the applicant 's unilateral decision. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Accordingly , I would also vacate the preliminary injunction based on the allegations of inequitable conduct . The evidence raises a substantial question of unenforceability that makes the patents vulnerable to being found unenforceable at trial . Thus , the district court erred when it concluded that Abbott had shown it would likely succeed on the merits . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Because of the reasons stated above , I would reverse the district court on the basis that there are substantial questions of both validity and enforceability of the ¡¬718 patent preventing a finding of likelihood of success on the merits . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 544 F.3d 1341 , 89 U.S.P.Q.2d 1161 _NEWLINE_ Footnotes _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ * _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Circuit Judge Schall did not participate in the vote . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Abbott Laboratories v.

Cmin is the minimum rug concentration over a dosing interval . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 4 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ `` Taste perversion '' is defined in the ¡¬718 patent as `` the perception of a bitter metallic taste normally associated with erythromycin derivatives , particularly , with clarithromycin . '' Col. 3 , lines 53-55 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 5 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Sandoz requests that we instruct that on remand this case should be assigned to a different judge , in order to `` further the interests of judicial economy '' . We discern no basis for this request ; it is denied . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The specification of the ¡¬718 patent states , in a list of definitions , that `` 'pharmaceutically acceptable ' as used herein , means those compounds which are , within the scope of sound medical judgment , suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower animals without undue toxicity , irritation , allergic response , and the like , in keeping with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio , and effective for their intended use in the chemotherapy and prophylaxis of antimicrobial infections . '' In my judgment the district court 's claim construction is ambiguous as to whether the pharmaceutically acceptable polymer must extend release or whether it can be part of a matrix in which other components extend the release . Sandoz is correct that there needs to be some showing that the polymer acts to extend release . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 2 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ These figures are based on FDA definitions . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 3 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Abbott specifically carved out azithromycin from its definition of an erythromycin derivative in the ¡¬718 patent . See Andrx , 452 F.3d at 1337 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 4 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In Andrx , this court relied primarily on the ¡¬190 patent , as combined with the ¡¬422 publication to find that there was a substantial question as to the obviousness of the ¡¬718 patent claims . 452 F.3d at 1340-41 . First , we concluded that `` Teva makes substantial arguments that the ¡¬190 patent discloses a clarithromycin composition ... that arguably has the pharmacokinetic parameters required in claim 4 of the ¡¬ 718 patent . '' Id . at 1340 . And we explained : _NEWLINE_ Because the ¡¬190 patent explicitly discloses only clarithromycin controlled release compositions , yet claims azithromycin compositions , ... Abbott has represented to the [ PTO ] that the differences between clarithromycin and azithromycin were such that azithromycin could be substituted into a controlled release clarithromycin composition by a person of ordinary skill in the art without undue experimentation ... . As a result , based on Abbott 's own ¡¬190 patent , there exists a substantial argument that a person of ordinary skill in the art would be motivated to combine the ¡¬422 publication , namely the use of HPMC in extended release macrolide compositions , with the ¡¬190 patent with a reasonable expectation of success . _NEWLINE_ Id . at 1341 . In this case , Abbott presented evidence at trial suggesting that this court was scientifically incorrect to find that the ¡¬ 190 patent disclosed compounds that arguably had the same PK values as the asserted claims . Sandoz , based on this new evidence , disclaimed any reliance on the scientific evidence of the ¡¬190 patent disclosing compounds with the same PK values as the ¡¬718 patent . However , contrary to the majority opinion , Sandoz can rely on Andrx 's conclusion that it would have been obvious for a person skilled in the art to substitute clarithromycin for azithromycin in an extended release formula with the anticipation of success without undue experimentation . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 5 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Given KSR 's broad understanding of nearly all or perhaps all inventions being combinations of elements in the prior art , the parties ' dispute about whether KSR should be limited to such inventions becomes largely irrelevant . In any event , while KSR 's holding is directed particularly at the TSM test , it certainly appears that the Court intended to expound principles of obviousness jurisprudence that were generally applicable . And particularly relevant to the case at bar , this court has already applied KSR 's teachings to the question of whether new chemical compositions are obvious in light of the fact that chemists of ordinary skill would attempt to modify known substances in certain ways to `` obtain compounds with improved properties . '' Takeda , 492 F.3d at 1356 . Accordingly , I think the district court clearly erred in concluding that KSR was not relevant to the question of obviousness here . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 6 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ See also Pfizer , Inc. v. Apotex , Inc. , 480 F.3d 1348 , 1362 ( Fed.Cir.2007 ) ( `` [ It ] is irrelevant [ to the question of obviousness ] that none of the anions specifically listed in the ¡¬909 patent have a cyclic structure , because the motivation to make amlodipine besylate here is gleaned not only from the prior art as a whole rather than the ¡¬909 patent alone , but also from the nature of the problems encountered with the amlodipine maleate tablet formulations sought to be solved by the inventors of the ¡¬303 patent. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 7 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The written description of the ¡¬718 patent states that `` The mean DFL values for the controlled release formulation [ another Abbott prior art reference disclosing a clarithromycin formulation ] and for the IR are substantially equal in value ... . '' ¡¬718 Patent , col.11 ll.18-19 . And it explains that lower DFL values for the ER formulation of the ¡¬718 patent show that it provides `` less variable clarithromycin concentrations throughout the day than the IR and the sustained release compositions . '' ¡¬ 718 Patent , col.11 ll.25-26 . These statements were correct based on three studies that had been done prior to filing the application . However , a new study W98-268 , which Gustavson had knowledge of , and which issued while the application was pending , found that there was a statistically significant lower DFL value for the sustained release formulas than the IR formulas . Gustavson , however , failed to disclose the results of this new study . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_
