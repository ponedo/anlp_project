b & w appeals the district_courts holding that claims 1 4 and 11 of u.s. reissue patent no._3 2,615 the` luke_patent' or`615_patent` were invalid for obviousness over the prior_art.1 pm cross-appeals the district_courts holdings that 1 claims 1 4 and 11 of the luke_patent were infringed2 by the virginia slims superslims` vsss' cigarette manufactured by pm ; 2 pms infringement was willful up until receipt of oral opinions in march and may of 1989 ; and 3 claims 1 4 and 11 of the luke_patent were not invalid due to an alleged_public_use
because the district_court did not err in finding claims 1 4 and 11 obvious over the prior_art we affirm the district_courts decision that claims 1 4 and 11 are invalid
because that decision moots the remaining issues we do not address the district_courts other_invalidity_decision or *1123 its decisions regarding infringement and willfulness

background
john luke the inventor of the luke_patent was an employee of british american tobacco co. ltd.` bat' and worked in the field of research and design of cigarettes
in the early 1980s lukes work was focused on using less_tobacco in a cigarette and thereby reducing manufacturing expenses
his work led him to conclude that smaller circumference cigarettes burned more efficiently
luke made several prototypes of reduced circumference cigarettes and disclosed his discovery to management
b & w a subsidiary of bat became aware of lukes reduced circumference cigarettes and obtained an exclusive license for them in the united_states

b & w filed a patent application covering lukes discovery and u.s. patent no._4637,410 the`410_patent` issued on january 20 1987
shortly thereafter citing an error in the analysis of a prior_art patent to lephardt b & w filed a reissue application and also submitted additional references for consideration by the u.s. patent and trademark office
after some amendments the application was reissued as the luke_patent on march_1,_1988
the luke_patent claims a foreign application priority date of may_24,_1985 and a u.s. priority date of july_22,_1985
the luke_patent contains fifteen claims of which only claim 1 is independent
the only claims involved in the present litigation are claims 1 4 and 11
the central limitation in the luke_patent is cigarette circumference which is limited to 10-19 mm
as a point of reference traditional cigarettes have circumferences of 23-27 mm

around the time that the410_patent issued b & w began selling a 17 mm_cigarette which was eventually marketed under the name` capri'
the luke_patent discloses an embodiment having a circumference of 17 mm and the parties agree that claims 1 4 and 11 read on the capri
shortly after the410_patent issued and b & w began marketing capri pm began developing a product to compete with the capri
it took more than two years however for pm to place its competing cigarette the vsss on the market

on may_30,_1989 b & w filed a complaint against pm for infringement of the luke_patent and subsequently a bench_trial was held
in its decision the district_court held that the asserted claims were invalid for obviousness and willfully infringed but not invalid due to an alleged_public_use
the district_court also held that the luke_patent was not unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct
both parties appeal the decision to this court
they appeal or cross-appeal each holding except for the finding of no inequitable_conduct
we have exclusive jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1 1994

discussion
a
standard of review
on appeal from a bench_trial we review a district_courts decision for errors of law and clearly erroneous findings of fact
see fed.r.civ.p

analysis
1
claims at issue
only claims 1 4 and 11 of the luke_patent are at issue
claim 1 is reproduced below 1
a finished cigarette of commercially acceptable_quality and elegant appearance
in the form of an elongated rod of uniform cross-section throughout its length capable of sustained_smoulder when lit but not being smoked said elongated rod consisting of
a cut_tobacco_filler a cigarette paper wrapper circumscribing said cut_tobacco_filler *1124 a filter in abutment with one end of said cut_tobacco_filler and
a tipping wrapper maintaining said filter in abutment with said one end of said cut_tobacco_filler the circumference of said elongated rod being within a range of 10 mm to 19 mm and having a cut_tobacco_filler packing density within the range of 150 mg per cmbig_token__3_to_350__big_token mg per cm3 yielding a free burn rate of said rod within a range of 25_to_45 mg min-1 the aforesaid cigarette utilizing tobacco at greater efficiency than conventional commercially marketed cigarettes
luke_patent col._3,_ll._22-38
although the claim appears in the luke_patent as one continuous paragraph without parsing we have parsed the claim for clarity in our analysis

claim 4 reads as follows` a cigarette as claimed in claim 1 wherein the packing density of said cut_tobacco_filler is within a range of 200 mg per cmbig_token__3_to_300__big_token mg per cm3'
id.at col._4,_ll._1-3
claim 11 reads as follows` a cigarette as claimed in claim 1 which provides in excess of about 8 puffs'
id.at col._4,_ll._26-27
the construction of these claims is not in dispute

obviousness
the ultimate_determination of whether an invention would have been obvious is a legal conclusion based on the totality of the evidence see richardson-vicks inc. v. upjohn co. 122_f.3d_1476 1483 44_uspq2d_1181 1187 fed.cir.1997 including underlying factual inquiries such as 1 the scope and content of the prior_art ; 2 the level of ordinary_skill in the prior_art ; 3 the differences between the claimed invention and the prior_art ; and 4 objective evidence of nonobviousness
see graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 17-18 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966) ; in re dembiczak 175_f.3d_994 998 50_uspq2d_1614 1616 fed.cir.1999 abrogated on other grounds by in re gartside 203_f.3d_1305 53_uspq2d_1769_(fed.cir.2000)
accordingly this ultimate_determination of obviousness is reviewed without deference while any factual findings are reviewed for clear_error
see winner int l royalty corp. v. wang 202_f.3d_1340 1348 53_uspq2d_1580 1586 fed.cir.2000
the supreme court has stated that a holding is clearly erroneous when` although there is evidence to support [ the holding ] the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm_conviction that a mistake has been committed'
united_states v. united_states_gypsum_co. 333_u.s._364 395 68_s.ct._525 92_l.ed._746_(1948)
in deciding the legal_question of obviousness we bear in mind that the party asserting invalidity of a patent must prove the disputed facts by clear and convincing evidence
see georgia-pacific corp. v. united_states_gypsum_co. 195_f.3d_1322 1330 52_uspq2d_1590 1597 fed.cir.2000 ; newell cos. inc. v. kenney mfg co. 864_f.2d_757 767 9_uspq2d_1417 1425 fed.cir.1988

the statutory_standard for the ultimate_determination of obviousness provides that a claimed invention is unpatentable if the differences between it and the prior_art` are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary_skill in the art'
35 u.s.c.¡± 103 1994 ; see also graham 383 u.s. at 13 86_s.ct._684
in line with this statutory_standard our case_law provides that` [ t ] he consistent criterion for determination of obviousness is whether the prior_art would have suggested to one of ordinary_skill in the art that this process should be carried out and would have a reasonable_likelihood of success viewed in the light of the prior_art'
in re dow chem. 837_f.2d_469 473 5_uspq2d_1529 1531 fed.cir.1988
two requirements are contained in this criterion

the first requirement is that a showing of a suggestion teaching or motivation to combine the prior_art references *1125 is an` essential evidentiary component of an obviousness holding'
c.r
bard inc. v. m3 sys inc. 157_f.3d_1340 1352 48_uspq2d_1225 1232 fed.cir.1998
this evidence may flow from the prior_art references themselves the knowledge of one of ordinary_skill in the art or in some cases from the nature of the problem to be solved
see pro-mold & tool co. v. great lakes plastics inc. 75_f.3d_1568 1573 37_uspq2d_1626 1630 fed.cir.1996
however the suggestion more often comes from the teachings of the pertinent references
see in re rouffet 149_f.3d_1350 1359 47_uspq2d_1453 1459 fed.cir.1998
this showing must be clear and particular and broad conclusory statements about the teaching of multiple references standing alone are not` evidence'
see dembiczak 175 f.3d at 1000 50 uspq2d at 1617
however the suggestion to combine need not be express and` may come from the prior_art as filtered through the knowledge of one skilled in the art'
motorola inc. v. interdigital technology corp. 121_f.3d_1461 1472 43_uspq2d_1481 1489 fed.cir.1997

the second requirement is that the ultimate_determination of obviousness` does not require absolute predictability of success.. [ a ] ll that is required is a reasonable expectation of success'
in re o'farrell 853_f.2d_894 903-904 7_uspq2d_1673 1681 fed.cir.1988 ; see also in re longi 759_f.2d_887 897 225_uspq_645 651-52 fed.cir.1985

factual inquiries
the district_court made findings on all four of the graham factors
the court described the prior_art at length described the level of ordinary_skill in cigarette_design at the time when luke made his invention explained the differences between the prior_art and the claims at issue and assessed various_secondary_indicators of nonobviousness
the district_court found obviousness based primarily on the prior_art of the more_cigarette and the three references of rice resnik and muramatsu

a
the prior art` more' cigarette
in 1974 r.j. reynolds tobacco co. marketed a cigarette in the united_states under the name of` more'
the more_cigarette is therefore prior_art under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b
the district_court found that the more_cigarette had a circumference of 20.8 mm had a packing density of 263 mg/cm3 had a static_burn_rate of 39-42 mg/min provided 15.4 puffs per cigarette and delivered 53 mg of tobacco per puff
the district_court further found that the more_cigarette met every limitation of claims 1 4 and 11 except the circumference_limitation
the record supports each of these findings and the parties do not dispute them

b
level of ordinary skill
the district_court found and the parties do not dispute that a person of ordinary_skill in the art of cigarette_design in 1985 would have had a bachelors degree in either engineering chemistry physics or chemical engineering and would have had at least five years experience in the field of cigarette_design

c. prior art teaching to reduce circumference
the parties agree that as of the time the invention claimed in the luke_patent was made one of ordinary_skill in the art of cigarette_design would have been familiar with reducing the circumference of an orthodox 25 mm cigarette to a circumference as small as 21 mm and that a 21 mm_cigarette such as the more_cigarette could have been manufactured within commercially acceptable parameters
the parties dispute however whether a further reduction from the orthodox circumference of about 25 mm to the range of 10_to_19_mm with the parameters specified in claims 1 4 and 11 of the615_patent would have been obvious at that time to *1126 one skilled in the art under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103

in making the luke_invention luke discovered that his 10_to_19_mm_cigarette utilized tobacco at a more efficient rate than conventional_cigarettes and afforded certain other advantages which he claims were heretofore unknown to those skilled in the art
luke refers to this efficiency as tobacco utilization efficiency` tue' which reflects the amount of tobacco consumed per puff
a lower value of tue reflects a more efficient cigarette
the concept of tue is critical to the obviousness analysis inasmuch as the discovery of the increased efficiency of a reduced diameter cigarette was lukes key to solving his expressed long-felt need to reduce the amount of tobacco used in a cigarette
according to luke his recognition that a commercially adequate puff_count and sustained_smoulder could be achieved in a 10_to_19_mm_circumference cigarette was an unobvious advance and successfully achieved the goal of improving the efficiency of burning tobacco

the question thus before us is whether one skilled in the art of cigarette_design would have recognized at the time of the luke_invention that a reduction in circumference of the thinnest_cigarette then on the market would yield a cigarette which burns tobacco more efficiently as tue is defined by luke

the district_court found that at the time of the luke_invention molins machine co.` molins' was a leading manufacturer of cigarette-making machines and sold cigarette machines that could produce cigarettes of different preselected circumferences
the record shows that molins sold a mark 5 machine from the 1930s through the 1960s and that a series of change parts were also sold at that time that enabled the production of varying sizes of cigarettes including cigarettes with as small as a 15 mm_circumference at a rate of up to 1350 cigarettes per minute
the district_court found therefore that a person of ordinary_skill at the time the invention was made would have had the technical capability to make a 19 mm_cigarette if so motivated
the parties do not dispute this finding

the district_court found that the three references to rice resnik and muramatsu in combination provided the motivation for such change by teaching that reducing the circumference would save money
we discuss these findings and each of the cited references below

the first of the three references relied on by the district_court is an article written by r.l
rice
r.l
rice a weight loss technique for determining rate of static burn tobacco_science dec. 1970 at 173` rice_article'
the district_court found that the rice_article taught that a directly proportional_relationship existed between the static_burn_rate of a cigarette and its circumference
the district_court also found that while the test data in the rice_article only included circumferences from 23 mm to 27 mm rice did not limit his results to that range and the extension of the directly proportional_relationship down to circumferences as low as 19 mm would not be unexpected

b & w argues that the rice_article does not close the gap between the claimed 19 mm_circumference and the 20.8 mm_circumference of the more_cigarette
b & w also argues that the rice_article does not address claimed limitations such as tobacco density burn rate tue or sustained_smoulder nor address features such as an acceptable puff_count acceptable resistance to draw and palatability which b & w_associates with commercially acceptable_quality
pm responds that the district_court was correct in finding that an extension of the rice_relationship to 19 mm would not be unexpected
as support for this contention pm notes that the rice_relationship actually predicts the static_burn_rate for the more_cigarette and predicts the claimed range of static_burn_rates for cigarettes having a 10-19 mm_circumference

*1127 we discern no clear_error in the district_courts findings
the rice_article itself includes an equation as the district_court noted showing the directly proportional_relationship between a cigarettes static_burn_rate and its circumference
see rice_article at 174
the rice_article also provides in table 4 for example data for circumferences as low as 23 mm
while such data does not predict with certainty that the relationship would hold at 19 mm the district_court is not clearly erroneous in concluding that it would have been an expected result
b & ws arguments regarding the claimed features and commercially acceptable_quality are inapposite because the rice_article was not cited by the district_court as a reference for any of these attributes
rice however did not address the effect that decreasing the circumference had on tue or the puff_count so we turn next to the resnik_article

the second reference relied on by the district_court is an article written by dr. frank resnik
frank resnik factors affecting static burn rate tobacco_science sept. 1977 at 103` resnik_article'
the district_court found that the resnik_article as with the rice_article taught the directly proportional_relationship between circumference and static_burn_rate and provided experimental_data for circumferences as low as 23 mm
more importantly the district_court found that resnik taught that a reduction in circumference resulted in a decreased value of tue increased efficiency although resnik did not refer to it as such
the district_court found that this teaching provided a motivation to combine the references and make cigarettes of smaller circumference because cigarettes with decreased tue_values use less_tobacco and therefore cost less to produce

b & w echoes the arguments it levied against the rice_article asserting that the resnik_article does not close the gap between the claimed 19 mm_circumference and the 20.8 mm_circumference of the more_cigarette
b & w also argues that the resnik_article does not address the additional claim limitations or the various features that b & w_associates with commercially acceptable_quality
we note however that the district_court did not cite the resnik_article for these attributes
b & w does not challenge the district_courts finding that the resnik_article teaches that the value of tue_decreases as circumference decreases
pm responds by pointing out that the resnik_article expresses the directly proportional_relationship between circumference and static_burn_rate without any boundary on the range of circumferences for which it holds
pm further notes that resnik himself testified that the article intended to show that the relationship could be extrapolated beyond the experimental_data for 23 mm

we agree with the district_courts findings
the resnik_article clearly shows in figure 9 and the accompanying text for example the directly proportional_relationship between circumference and static_burn_rate
it also states that` the percentage decrease in puff_count caused by decreasing the circumference is not as great as the percentage weight reduction'
resnik_article at 106
thus the resnik_article does teach that reducing circumference decreases the value of tue and this provides a motivation to reduce the circumference of the more_cigarette
it is clear however that the relationship between circumference and static_burn_rate can not hold for all circumferences,3 and neither the rice_article nor the resnik_article expressly teaches this relationship for circumferences any lower than approximately 23 mm
to fill that void we turn to the muramatsu_article

the third reference relied on by the district_court is a translation of a japanese-language article written by m._muramatsu
m._muramatsu studies on the *1128 transfer phenomena in naturally smoldering cigarettes 123 nippon senbai kosha chuo kenkyusho 9 1981` muramatsu_article'
the district_court found that the muramatsu_article taught that the directly proportional_relationship between circumference and static_burn_rate extended at least theoretically down to circumferences as low as 18.8 mm
the district_court further found that the muramatsu_article in combination with the rice and resnick articles provided the motivation to make a cigarette with a 19 mm_circumference
the district_court based its findings on figure 9-4 of the muramatsu_article
figure 9-4 plots the circumference versus the static_burn_rate of several experimental_data_points
one of the experimental_data_points is for a circumference of approximately 20.2 mm as the district_court also found
figure 9-4 further includes a theoretical_data_point having a circumference of 18.8 mm which is the smallest circumference of all of the data_points
superimposed on these data_points is a best-fit_line demonstrating the directly proportional_relationship

b & w notes that the 18.8 mm data point in the muramatsu_article is theoretical and that the article itself does not discuss this theoretical_data_point
b & w argues that the theoretical_data_point alone can not be used as a basis for assuming that the article teaches that the directly proportional_relationship extends that far
b & w further argues that the superimposed line is inaccurate because the theoretical_data_point lies above the line and that this indicates that the directly proportional_relationship is already breaking down
accordingly b & w repeats its assertion that neither the muramatsu_article nor any other prior_art closes the gap to the claimed 19 mm_circumference

we hold that the district_court_findings are not clearly erroneous
as described above figure 9-4 of the muramatsu_article does show that the directly proportional_relationship between circumference and static_burn_rate holds at least in theory for circumferences as low as 18.8 mm
we find persuasive the district_courts reasoning that it could not` presume that the inclusion of the data point by muramatsu was without purpose or scientific reason'
b & w_opinion slip op.at 21
the fact that the theoretical_data_point lies slightly above the best-fit_line does not detract from the articles teaching

the key to the motivation to reduce the circumference is the resnik_articles teaching that the value of tue_decreases as the circumference is reduced
the motivation arises from the fact that the decreasing tue value results in less_tobacco being utilized thereby saving money
while the resnik_article taught that both the value of tue and the static_burn_rate decrease as the circumference is reduced it did not explicitly teach that either of these relationships holds as the circumference is reduced all the way down to 19 mm
the district_court found that the muramatsu_article filled this void with the teaching that static_burn_rate continues to linearly decrease at least in theory as the circumference is reduced to 19 mm
while the muramatsu_article did not explicitly address tue we can not say that we are` left with the definite and firm_conviction that a mistake has been committed' by the district_court
united_states gypsum 333 u.s. at 395 68_s.ct._525
the muramatsu teaching in combination with the resnik_articles teaching that tue_values and static_burn_rate move together suggests that the value of tue will also continue to decrease improved efficiency as the circumference is reduced to 19 mm
as the district_court found` one skilled in the art of cigarette_design armed with the prior_art would know that a 10 %_reduction in circumference of the thinnest_cigarette then on the market would yield a cigarette which burns tobacco more efficiently as tue is defined by luke'
b & w_opinion slip op.at 58
this reduction in the value of tue provides the motivation to reduce the circumference down to 19 mm

*1129 d. sustained smoulder
b & w asserts that even if there were a motivation to reduce the circumference of the more_cigarette there would have been an expectation that a 19 mm_cigarette would not be capable of sustained_smoulder
the district_court specifically addressed this concern
it found that the prior_art including the three references and the market successes of the more and other slim cigarettes would teach one of ordinary_skill that a commercially acceptable cigarette capable of sustained_smoulder could be manufactured with a circumference of 19 mm
see b & w_opinion slip op.at 24-25 30

we agree with the district_courts finding regarding sustained_smoulder
the inventor of the more_cigarette cundiff testified that he had concerns with smoulder as well as a variety of other interrelated characteristics such as draw and pressure drop
as the district_court noted however the success of the more revealed that cundiff had successfully dealt with these concerns for a cigarette with a circumference of 20.8 mm
see b & w_opinion slip op.at 30
it is not clearly erroneous to expect as the district_court did that a person of ordinary_skill would have been able to address these concerns adequately while reducing the circumference another 8.7 % down to 19 mm
further b & w admits that the static_burn_rate at which conventional commercial cigarettes self-extinguish is in the range of 25-40 mg/min
the static_burn_rate of the more_cigarette was found to be 39-42 mg/min
given an 8.7 %_reduction in circumference the rice formula which was described earlier and which was found to be extendible to 19 mm by muramatsus teaching yields an expected static_burn_rate of 35.6-38.3 mg/min
( 91.3 % of the range of 39-42 mg/min
for a 19 mm_cigarette
this is well above b & ws stated lower limit of 25 mg/min
for conventional_cigarettes

e. secondary indicators of nonobviousness
as outlined earlier graham and its progeny require the consideration of various_secondary_indicators of nonobviousness
the secondary_indicators listed in graham are 1 commercial_success ; 2 long-felt but unsolved needs ; and 3 failure of others
see graham 383 u.s. at 17 86_s.ct._684
other secondary_indicators have been considered as well
see environmental designs ltd. v. union oil co. of cal. 713_f.2d_693 697-98 218_uspq_865 869 fed.cir.1983 considering skepticism or disbelief before the invention as an indicator of nonobviousness ; allen archery inc. v. browning mfg co. 819_f.2d_1087 1092 2_uspq2d_1490 1493 fed.cir.1987 considering copying praise unexpected_results and industry acceptance as indicators of nonobviousness ; diversitech corp. v. century steps inc. 850_f.2d_675 679 7_uspq2d_1315 1319 fed.cir.1988 considering copying as an indicator of nonobviousness
the district_court made findings related to a number of these secondary_indicators

i
commercial success
we examine separately the commercial_success of the capri and the vsss
with regard to the capri the district_court found from the evidence before it that it was` impossible.. to distinguish market_share resulting from the patented attributes of the capri cigarette from that which was achieved through targeted marketing and image development'
b & w_opinion slip op.at 61
b & w argues that the district_court improperly shifted the burden to b & w to prove a nexus between the commercial_success of capri and the claimed features and that such a nexus should be presumed because the capri embodies the claimed features
pm responds that it produced sufficient evidence to demonstrate that capris sales were unrelated to its patented features thus overcoming any presumption of nexus and that no burden was improperly shifted to b & w. as explained below we hold that the district_court was not clearly *1130 erroneous in finding that any nexus which may have been established for the capri was rebutted by the evidence of record

a nexus between commercial_success and the claimed features is required
see j.t
eaton & co. v. atlantic paste & glue co. 106_f.3d_1563 1571 41_uspq2d_1641 1647 fed.cir.1997 ; demaco corp. v. f. von langsdorff licensing ltd. 851_f.2d_1387 1392 7_uspq2d_1222 1226 fed.cir.1988
however if the marketed product embodies the claimed features and is coextensive with them then a nexus is presumed and the burden shifts to the party asserting obviousness to present evidence to rebut the presumed nexus
see j.t
eaton 106 f.3d at 1571 41 uspq2d at 1647 ; demaco 851 f.2d at 1392-93 7 uspq2d at 1226
the presumed nexus can not be rebutted with mere argument ; evidence must be put forth

in this case a nexus should be presumed because the capri encompasses the claimed features

however there is ample evidence of record which was presented to rebut this presumed nexus
the record shows that another slim cigarette brand containing all of the claimed features but not targeting female_smokers was a commercial failure
the record also shows that b & w marketed the capri toward female_smokers and that the feminine packaging of the capri was important to these smokers and influenced their purchase decisions
the record further shows that b & w engaged in promotional offers for years after the capri launch and it indicates that many capri smokers originally tried capri as the result of a promotion and would discontinue smoking capri without the promotions

the district_court did not consider the commercial_success of the vsss pms competing product as a secondary indicator of nonobviousness for the luke_patent
b & w argues that this was error in light of the fact that the district_court found the vsss to infringe the luke_patent
see gambro lundia ab v. baxter healthcare corp. 110_f.3d_1573 1579 42_uspq2d_1378 1384 fed.cir.1997 considering the commercial_success of the infringing product as evidence of the commercial_success of the claimed invention
pm responds that the combined market_share of the vsss and the capri is only 1 % and that this is insufficient to support a finding of commercial_success

we agree with b & w that the district_court erred by not considering the success of the vsss
our case_law provides that the success of an infringing product is considered to be evidence of the commercial_success of the claimed invention
see id
however as we discuss later after reviewing the remaining secondary_indicators of nonobviousness the district_courts error is harmless because the modest level of commercial activity and limited market_share achieved by the vsss can not overcome the strong_evidence of obviousness
see richardson-vicks 122 f.3d at 1483 44 uspq2d at 1187

ii
additional secondary indicators
with regard to other secondary_indicators of nonobviousness the district_court found that 1 there was no evidence that others had tried and failed to create a reduced circumference cigarette ; 2 there was no long-felt but unmet need to use less_tobacco in a cigarette ; and 3 there were no unexpected_results
b & w does not appear to challenge these specific findings
moreover the record supports each of these findings and we hold that the district_court was not clearly erroneous

b & w argues however and we agree that the district_court erred with regard to certain other secondary_indicators
specifically b & w asserts that the district_court erred as a matter of law in discounting pms statements of praise for the capri in failing to consider pms skepticism *1131 and cundiffs skepticism and in failing to consider pms copying of the capri
accordingly in reaching the ultimate legal determination regarding obviousness we will accept b & ws characterization of pms skepticism praise and copying of the capri as well as cundiffs skepticism

the scope of these errors is limited however by two district_court_findings that are not clearly erroneous
first the district_court found that there was no evidence that any other tobacco company had praised the capri
second the district_court found b & ws skepticism and characterization of the conventional_wisdom unpersuasive stating b & w offered some testimony that it was the conventional_wisdom prior to lukes invention that a cigarette in the range of 10_to_19_mm wouldburn up like a fuse or would not be capable of sustained_smoulder or would be otherwise commercially unacceptable
however the literature of rice and muramatsu coupled with the existing cigarettes in the industry would have suggested otherwise to one skilled in the art of cigarette_design
b & w_opinion slip op.at 24
as we discuss immediately below these limited district_court errors are harmless even when coupled with the presumed market_share of the vsss because they can not overcome the strong_evidence of obviousness

ultimate determination of obviousness
as stated earlier the ultimate_determination of whether an invention is obvious is a legal_question based on the totality of the evidence
see richardson-vicks 122 f.3d at 1483 44 uspq2d at 1187
that evidence includes the district_courts findings which we have upheld that the prior_art 1 included the more_cigarette which met all of the limitations of the claims at issue except the circumference_limitation ; 2 provided motivation to reduce the circumference of the more by less than 9 % to the claimed range ; and 3 taught that sustained_smoulder could be achieved at a 19 mm_circumference
this constitutes overwhelming evidence of obviousness particularly in light of the relatively small difference between the prior_art more_cigarette and the claimed invention and the high degree of skill for the ordinary artisan

the only evidence which b & w can marshal against these findings consists of the secondary_indicators of nonobviousness which the district_court erred in not considering
those indicators are 1 the market_share of the vsss ; 2 pms skepticism praise and copying ; and 3 cundiffs skepticism
we will assume as b & w argues that the vsss enjoyed a 0.5 %_market_share and we will accept b & ws characterization of pms skepticism praise and copying of the capri as well as cundiffs skepticism
we find persuasive however the facts that despite pms skepticism praise and copying it was only able to achieve a 0.5 %_market_share with the vsss and that only a single competitor is alleged to have praised or copied the capri
further although cundiffs skepticism is entitled to some weight we find persuasive the district_courts disagreement with the purported conventional_wisdom at the time of the luke_invention that a 19 mm_cigarette was not feasible
see b & w_opinion slip op.at 24
accordingly these indicators of nonobviousness can not overcome the strong_evidence of obviousness
see newell 864 f.2d at 769 9 uspq2d at 1427 finding obviousness despite strong_evidence of commercial_success
the district_courts errors in not considering various_secondary_indicators are therefore harmless
see id.at 768 864_f.2d_757 9 uspq2d at 1426 stating that secondary_indicators` do not control the obviousness conclusion'

we conclude that the prior_art would have suggested to one of ordinary_skill in the art at the time the615 invention was made that claims 1 4 and 11 should be carried out and would have a reasonable_likelihood of success
see in re dow *1132 chem. 837 f.2d at 473 5 uspq2d at 1531
accordingly we hold as a matter of law that claims 1 4 and 11 would have been obvious over the prior_art and are therefore invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103

conclusion
because the district_court did not err in finding claims 1 4 and 11 obvious over the prior_art we do not address the district_courts other_invalidity_decision or its decisions regarding infringement and willfulness
for the reasons set forth above we affirm the district_courts judgment that claims 1 4 and 11 are invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103

affirmed
