abbott_laboratories` abbott' brought suit against teva_pharmaceuticals_usa inc.` teva' alleging infringement of its patents relating to extended_release_formulations of clarithromycin
abbott moved for a preliminary_injunction against teva on the grounds that teva was infringing claims 2 4 and 6 of u.s._patent_no._6010,718`718_patent` and claim 2 of u.s._patent_no._6551,616`616_patent`
teva resisted the motion primarily by arguing that substantial_questions existed as to the validity of abbotts asserted claims under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103
the district_court agreed that teva had raised a substantial_question as to the validity of claim 2 of the616_patent but it rejected tevas invalidity_arguments as to the asserted claims of the718_patent
accordingly the district_court granted abbotts motion for a preliminary_injunction
teva appealed
we have jurisdiction to review the district_courts order under 28 u.s.c.¡± 1292 c 1

on appeal teva has raised substantial issues as to the validity of each of the asserted claims relied upon for the preliminary_injunction
we vacate the preliminary_injunction

i. clarithromycin is a broad spectrum antibiotic from the macrolide family of antibiotics all of which are derived from erythromycin a. taisho pharmaceuticals ltd. received u.s._patent no._4331,803`803_patent` for clarithromycin in 1982
in 1991 abbott the exclusive licensee of the803_patent introduced biaxin an immediate_release dosage form of clarithromycin
the803_patent expired on may_23,_2005

*big_token__1333_in_1997__big_token abbott filed for a patent claiming an extended_release_formulation of clarithromycin
the patent describes and claims extended_release` er' formulations comprising erythromycin_derivatives combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable_polymer
the resulting drug-polymer_matrix leads to the extended_release properties of the formulation
the er formulation enabled patients to take one pill per day rather than twice as had been required with the immediate_release` ir' formulation
that patent issued on january 4 2000 as the718_patent
further based on the718_patent application abbott filed a continuation-in-part application that claims a method of reducing adverse gastrointestinal` gi' side_effects of erythromycin-derived drug formulations by using extended_release_formulations
this continuation-in-part issued as the616_patent
in 2000 abbott introduced its er clarithromycin formulation biaxin_xl
as of may 2005 abbott estimated that as between biaxin and biaxin_xl biaxin_xl accounted for 70 % of sales in the biaxin market
as the original patent on clarithromycin expired on may_23,_2005 generic competitors entered the market for immediate_release clarithromycin on may_24,_2005

in december 2002 teva filed an abbreviated new drug application` anda' seeking approval to market an extended_release form of clarithromycin similar to abbotts er clarithromycin drug biaxin_xl
on march_14,_2005 abbott sued teva for infringement of the718 and616_patent s.1 on may_18,_2005 abbott moved for a preliminary_injunction against teva

on may 26 and june_1,_2005 the district_court held oral argument on abbotts motion for the preliminary_injunction and thereafter on june 3 issued its memorandum opinion
it listed the four factor_test for the grant of a preliminary_injunction namely that the party seeking the preliminary_injunction must show
( 1 the movant has some likelihood of success on the merits of the underlying_litigation ; 2 immediate_irreparable_harm will result if the relief is not granted ; 3 the balance of hardships to the parties weighs in the movants favor ; and 4 the public_interest is best served by granting the injunctive_relief

the district_court began its analysis and evaluated abbotts likelihood of success on the merits by considering abbotts infringement contentions and tevas invalidity_defenses
teva did not dispute that its generic er formulation of clarithromycin infringed abbotts718 and616_patent claims
rather teva alleged that the asserted patent claims were invalid for obviousness under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103
the court focused on tevas invalidity_arguments and concluded that teva had raised a substantial_question as to the validity of claim 2 of the616_patent but it` ha [ d ] not established that claims 2 4 and 6 of the718_patent are invalid for obviousness'
abbott_labs. slip op.at 32
thus as to the asserted claims of the718_patent abbott had established a likelihood of success on the merits
as to irreparable_harm the *1334 district_court first noted that because of its finding that abbott had proved a likelihood of success on the merits of infringement for the718_patent claims there was a presumption of irreparable_harm that teva had to rebut
furthermore abbott contended that it will face` irreversible market share losses [ if ].. it loses its preferred position on pharmacy and insurance formularies'
abbott_labs. slip op.at 25
as a result the district_court concluded that` entry of the generic_extended_release_formulation_competitor will likely crush the market' and therefore absent the preliminary_injunction_abbott would suffer irreparable_harm
abbott_labs. slip op.at 27
as to the third factor the district_court stated that teva was` reluctan [ t ] or inab [ le ] to quantify the hardship if any it will face if an injunction is incorrectly entered' and` there is little_choice but to conclude that the balance of hardships favors [ abbott ]'
abbott_labs. slip op.at 30-31
lastly the district_court determined that` [ t ] o the extent that this court has found that the patents in suit are valid the public_interest is best served by enforcing them'
id
based on these considerations the court issued its order entering the preliminary_injunction with respect to the asserted claims of the718_patent

ii
on appeal teva argues that the district_court erred in holding that abbott had demonstrated that tevas invalidity_defense to claims 2 4_and_6 of the718_patent lacked substantial_merit
teva also argues that the district_court erred in finding that abbott had established that it would suffer irreparable_harm if teva were not enjoined
as a result of those two errors teva alleges that the district_court abused its discretion in granting abbotts motion for preliminary_injunction

in response abbott contends that as to claims 2 4 and 6 of the718_patent it made a clear showing of likelihood of success on the merits and it is entitled to the presumption that it would suffer irreparable_harm absent the preliminary_injunction
furthermore abbott argues that the preliminary_injunction ruling could be affirmed on the alternate grounds that teva failed to raise a substantial challenge to the validity of claim 2 of the616_patent

the grant or denial of a preliminary_injunction under 35 u.s.c.¡± 283 is within the sound_discretion of the district_court
amazon.com inc. v. barnesandnoble.com 239_f.3d_1343 1350 fed.cir.2001
as the supreme court recently held on the closely related topic of permanent injunctions` [ t ] he decision to grant or deny permanent injunctive_relief is an act of equitable_discretion by the district_court reviewable on appeal for abuse of discretion'

( quoting 35 u.s.c.¡± 283
as the moving party abbott had to establish its right to a preliminary_injunction in light of four factors 1 the movant has some likelihood of success on the merits of the underlying_litigation ; 2 immediate_irreparable_harm will result if the relief is not granted ; 3 the balance of hardships to the parties weighs in the movants favor ; and 4 the public_interest is best served by granting the injunctive_relief
polymer_techs. inc. v. bridwell 103_f.3d_970 973 fed.cir.1996

*1335 an abuse of discretion in granting or denying a preliminary_injunction may be found` by showing that the court made a clear error of judgment in weighing relevant factors or exercised its discretion based upon an error of law or clearly erroneous factual findings'
id
( quoting novo_nordisk of n
am. inc. v. genentech inc. 77_f.3d_1364 1367 fed.cir.1996
we now turn to the factors relevant to a motion for a preliminary_injunction

iii
as to abbotts likelihood of success on the merits` teva does not dispute that its generic clarithromycin extended_release_formulation infringes abbotts718 and616_patent s. teva asserts that those patents.. are invalid for obviousness under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 2004'
abbott_labs. slip op.at 3
as a result` if [ the defendant ] raises a substantial_question concerning.. validity i.e.. [ an ] invalidity_defense that the patentee can not provelacks substantial_merit` then the patentee has not established a likelihood of success on the merits.2 amazon.com 239 f.3d at 1350-51 citing genentech inc. v. novo_nordisk a/s 108_f.3d_1361 1364 fed.cir.1997
furthermore as this case involves multiple patent claims` the patentee must demonstrate that.. at least one of [ the ] allegedly infringed claims will.. likely withstand the validity challenges presented by the accused infringer'
id
as to the burden regarding invalidity_allegations` [ v ] alidity challenges during preliminary_injunction proceedings can be successful that is they may raise substantial_questions of invalidity on evidence that would not suffice to support a judgment of invalidity at trial'
id.at 1358 citing helifix 208 f.3d at 1352
as this court has stated

in resisting a preliminary_injunction however one need not make out a case of actual invalidity
vulnerability is the issue at the preliminary_injunction stage while validity is the issue at trial
the showing of a substantial_question as to invalidity thus requires less_proof than the clear and convincing showing necessary to establish invalidity itself
id.at 1359
`` when moving for the extraordinary relief of a preliminary_injunction a patentee need not establish the validity of a patent beyond question
the patentee must however present a clear case supporting the validity of the patent in suit'
id
( citations omitted
turning to tevas invalidity_contentions based on obviousness`the first step *1336 is to determine the meaning and scope of each claim in suit
`` id
( quoting lemelson v. gen. mills inc. 968_f.2d_1202 1206 fed.cir.1992
`` only when a claim is properly understood can a determination be made.. whether the prior_art.. renders obvious the claimed invention'
id
we have stated that` [ q ] uite apart from the written description and the prosecution history the claims themselves provide substantial guidance as to the meaning of particular claim terms'
phillips v. awh corp. 415_f.3d_1303 1314 fed.cir.2005
`` first we look to the words of the claims themselves both asserted and nonasserted to define the scope of the patented invention'
vitronics corp. v. conceptronic inc. 90_f.3d_1576 1582 fed.cir.1996
where claim terms are ambiguous or disputed then we turn to the specification as` the specificationis always highly relevant to the claim construction analysis
usually it is dispositive ; it is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term
`` phillips 415 f.3d at 1315 quoting vitronics 90 f.3d at 1582

once the scope of the claims are determined the actual obviousness determination under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 begins
recently this court re-iterated the proper standards for making determinations under ¡± 103
in re kahn 441_f.3d_977_(fed.cir.2006)
first the court
determines the scope and content of the prior_art and ascertains the differences between the prior_art and the claims at issue and resolves the level of ordinary_skill in the pertinent art
against this background the [ court ] determines whether the subject_matter would have been obvious to a person of ordinary_skill in the art at the time of the asserted invention
id.at 985 citing dann v. johnston 425_u.s._219 226 96_s.ct._1393 47_l.ed.2d_692_(1976) and graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 13-14 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966)
in making this determination we noted in kahn that` [ m ] ost inventions arise from a combination of old_elements and each element may often be found in the prior_art'
id.at 986
the prior_art that is considered is drawn from references` either in the field of the applicants endeavor or is reasonably pertinent to the problem with which the inventor was concerned'
id.at 987
however mere identification in the prior_art of each element is insufficient to defeat the patentability of the combined subject_matter as a whole
rather a party alleging invalidity due to obviousness must articulate the reasons one of ordinary_skill in the art would have been motivated to select the references and to combine them to render the claimed invention obvious
id.at 986
thismotivation-suggestion-teaching test asks not merely what the references disclose but whether a person of ordinary_skill in the art possessed with the understandings and knowledge reflected in the prior_art and motivated by the general problem facing the inventor would have been led to make the combination recited in the claims
id.at 988

in analyzing tevas obviousness_contentions as to claims 2 4 and 6 of the718_patent and abbotts alternative_grounds for affirming the preliminary_injunction under claim 2 of616_patent we separate the analysis into two parts
claim 2_and_4 of the718_patent are closely related and are addressed first
claim 6 of the718_patent and claim 2 of the616_patent are dealt with next
for each pair of claims *1337 we construe the claims and we determine if the allegations raise substantial_questions of obviousness

a
we begin by examining claim 2_and_4 of the718_patent and the district_courts analysis regarding these claims
claim 2 of the718_patent claims3

a pharmaceutical_composition for extended_release of an erythromycin_derivative in the gastrointestinal_environment comprising
an erythromycin_derivative and
from about 5 to about 50 % by weight of a pharmaceutically acceptable_polymer wherein the polymer is a hydrophilic_water-soluble_polymer so that when ingested orally the composition induces statistically significantly lower_mean_fluctuation_index in the plasma than an immediate_release_composition of the erythromycin_derivative while maintaining bioavailability substantially equivalent to that of the immediate_release_composition of the erythromycin_derivative
'718_patent col._11,_ll._28-40
in short claim 2 has three basic_elements
first the extended_release composition includes an erythromycin_derivative
second it includes a polymer
third the claim includes specific_pharmacokinetic_parameters that the erythromycin_derivative and polymer composition must meet
similarly claim 4 claims
a pharmaceutical_composition for extended_release of an erythromycin_derivative in the gastrointestinal_environment comprising
an erythromycin_derivative and
from about 5 to about 50 % by weight of a pharmaceutically acceptable_polymer so that upon oral_ingestion maximum_peak_concentrations of the erythromycin_derivative are lower than those produced by an immediate_release_pharmaceutical_composition and area under the concentration-time_curve and the minimum_plasma_concentration are substantially equivalent to that of the immediate_release_pharmaceutical_composition
'718_patent col._11,_ll._48-58
as can be seen claim 4 also has three basic_elements the erythromycin_derivative the polymer and specific but different from claim 2 pharmacokinetic_parameters

from the specification the district_court defined erythromycin_derivative in both claims as meaning`erythromycin having no substituent groups or having conventional substituent groups in organic synthesis in place of a hydrogen atom of the hydroxy groups and/or a methyl group of the 3'-dimethylamino group which is prepared according to the conventional manner
`` abbott_labs. slip op.at 10 quoting718_patent col._3,_ll._34-39
notably this definition of erythromycin_derivative includes clarithromycin but excludes azithromycin a related macrolide antibiotic sold by pfizer as the drug zithromax

then construing` pharmaceutically acceptable_polymer' the district_court again properly turned to the718_patent specification
the specification describes this as` a water-soluble hydrophilic polymer selected from the group consisting of polyvinylpyrrolidine hydroxypropyl cellulose hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose methyl cellulose vinyl acetate/crotonic acid copolymers *1338 methacrylic acids copolymers maleic anhydride/methyl vinyl either copolymers and derivatives and mixtures thereof'
id
( quoting718_patent col._3,_l._65- col._4,_l._4
furthermore the specification describes the`more preferabl [ e ]` polymer as hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose` hpmc'
id
( quoting718_patent col._4,_l._7

the district_court also construed the more technical limitations in the claims
in claim 4 the pharmacokinetic_limitations require that
upon oral_ingestion maximum_peak_concentrations of the erythromycin_derivative are lower than those produced by an immediate_release_pharmaceutical_composition and area under the concentration-time_curve and the minimum_plasma_concentration are substantially equivalent to that of the immediate_release_pharmaceutical_composition
the district_court elaborated on this language by stating that
[ t ] his means that the concentration-time_curve representing the concentration of drug in blood plasma will be flatter and lower for the extended_release_formulation than for the immediate_release_formulation but will have an area under the curve` auc' that is substantially equivalent to that of its immediate_release corollary
at the same time the minimum_plasma_concentration for the extended_release_formulation will be substantially the same as that of the immediate_release_formulation meaning that the drug will be present in the blood at the same_minimum_level at all times for both the immediate_release and extended_release_formulations
id

the district_court did not address the pharmacokinetic_limitations of claim 2 explicitly
below in our analysis we turn to the specification to aid in defining the pharmacokinetic_parameters of claim 2

in making its invalidity_contentions teva pointed to a number of prior_art_references
these included published patent cooperation treaty application wo 95/30422` the422 publication'
it pertained to controlled-release_dosage_forms of azithromycin with hpmc that among other things was meant to address the gi_side_effects of azithromycin

teva also pointed to abbotts own u.s._patent no._5705,190`190_patent` which disclosed a controlled release pharmaceutical formulation of clarithromycin combined with a water soluble alginate salt
furthermore teva also cited a number of other prior_art_references including textbooks and government and trade publications that discussed controlled release pharmaceuticals
the district_court characterized these more general sources as` sources in the prior_art discussing extended_release_formulations and seeking ways to develop formulations that achieved desirable pharmacokinetic goals'
id

considering its tentative claim construction and after reviewing these prior_art_references the district_court determined that
teva has failed to raise a substantial_question as to the validity of abbotts claim 2_and_4
the prior_art cited by teva discloses discrete_portions of the asserted claims but teva fails to demonstrate that this would be sufficient to give a person of ordinary_skill in the art a reasonable_expectation of success
tevas prior_art_references reveal that using hpmc was a logical_line of inquiry but the dissimilarities between the drugs with which hpmc had been successfully *1339 combined and clarithromycin_defeat_tevas claim of obviousness.. abbott has provided ample_evidence that its invention was not obvious and that there were many other extended_release_formulations known in the prior_art
abbott_labs. slip op.at 17-18

1
on appeal we begin as did the district_court with the claims
we agree with the district_courts preliminary claim construction as to` erythromycin_derivative' and` pharmaceutically acceptable_polymer' in both claims 2_and_4
furthermore we agree with the district_courts elaboration on the pharmacokinetic_parameters of claim 4
in short the parameters of claim 4 require three things [ 1 ] maximum_peak_concentrations of the erythromycin_derivative are lower than those produced by an immediate_release_pharmaceutical_composition [ 2 ] area under the concentration-time_curve are substantially equivalent to that of the immediate_release_pharmaceutical_composition and [ 3 ] the minimum_plasma_concentration are substantially equivalent to that of the immediate_release_pharmaceutical_composition
'718_patent col._11,_ll._48-58
in order to more fully understand these specific parameters we turn to the specification
it defines a number of the relevant pharmacokinetic_parameters used in these claims
the specification defines the` maximum plasma concentration of the erythromycin_derivative produced by the ingestion of the composition of the invention or the ir comparator' as cmax
'718_patent col._3,_ll._13-15
likewise the minimum_plasma_concentration is defined as cmin
'718_patent col._3,_ll._15-19
the specification defines the area under the curve auc` as the area under the plasma concentration-time_curve as calculated by the trapezoidal rule over the complete 24-hour interval for all the formulations'
'718_patent col._3,_ll._26-29
from these definitions given in the specification we can describe the three pharmacokinetic_limitations of claim 4 as cmax_er < cmax_ir aucer = aucir and cmin_er = cmin_ir.4

as to claim 2 the district_court did not explicitly discuss that claims pharmacokinetic_parameters
nonetheless just as with claim 4 the parameters in claim 2 are defined in the specification
claim 2 requires that
the composition [ 1 ] induces statistically significantly lower_mean_fluctuation_index in the plasma than an immediate_release_composition of the erythromycin_derivative while [ 2 ] maintaining bioavailability substantially equivalent to that of the immediate_release_composition of the erythromycin_derivative
the specification defines the` degree of fluctuation' or dfl as dfl = cmax-cmin /cav718_patent col._3,_l._33
cav is the average concentration of the drug over a twenty-four hour interval718_patent col._3,_ll._19-22 and generally is defined as cav = auc/£n where £n > > > > > > > > is twenty-four hours
see shargel & yu applied biopharmaceutics and pharmacokinetics 252 3d ed.1993
the718_patent specification defines` bioavailability' as the log-transformed *1340 auc
'718_patent col._7,_l._17
based on this logarithm-based definition it follows that at a minimum where aucer = aucir then the two compositions would have substantially equivalent_bioavailability
thus sufficient conditions for satisfying claim 2s pharmacokinetic_parameters are that dfler < dflir and aucer = aucir

2
we now turn to the relevant prior_art and begin by focusing on the invalidity_allegations surrounding claim 4
as described above the prior_art includes the190_patent owned by abbott
the patent inter_alia describes and claims compositions of clarithromycin in an alginate_matrix
abbott itself describes that` the formulations are administered once a day and are directed towards increasing the bioavailability of the active_ingredient so that it is bioequivalent with the current immediate_release twice a-day compositions.`
'190_patent col._1,_ll._43-47
several disclosures in this patent merit attention
claim 4 of the190_patent claims` a controlled release solid pharmaceutical_composition.. comprising a therapeutically effective_amount of a macrolide.. [ and ] a water-soluble alginate salt..' furthermore claim 5 of the190_patent claims` [ t ] he composition of claim 4 wherein the macrolide is clarithromycin'
thus the190_patent discloses an extended_release_formulation of clarithromycin wherein the polymer used is alginate as opposed to the polymers like hpmc claimed in the718_patent

the190_patent also discloses particular pharmacokinetic_parameters for its controlled release clarithromycin and alginate compositions
for example as pointed out by teva a side-by-side comparison of formula_c of the190_patent with an ir formulation shows that formula_c exhibited a lower cmax 2.00 £gg/ml than the immediate_release_formulation 2.28 £gg/ml and substantially equivalent auc 28.69 ranging from 24.big_token__61_to_32__big_token74 £gg h/ml vs. 32.16 ranging from 25.big_token__66_to_42__big_token70 £ggh/ml and substantially equivalent cmin 0.66 ranging from 0.big_token__37_to_0__big_token91 £gg/ml vs. 0.72 ranging frombig_token__54_to_1__big_token05 £g g/ml
'190_patent col. 7 table 2
thus teva makes substantial_arguments that the190_patent discloses a clarithromycin composition with alginate as opposed to a polymer like hpmc that arguably has the pharmacokinetic_parameters required in claim 4 of the718_patent

of the claim limitations in claim 4 of the718_patent the190_patent does not disclose the claimed polymers of the718_patent
the190_patent only discloses the use of alginate in making controlled release_formulations
other prior_art though does disclose extended_release_formulations with pharmaceutically acceptable_polymers like hpmc
for example the422 publication filed by pfizer inc. discloses controlled-release_dosage_forms of azithromycin
in particular the application disclosed controlled release_formulations created from combining azithromycin with hpmc
abbott_labs. slip op.at 14

on appeal teva argues that based on the422 publication a person of ordinary_skill in the art would replace the alginate of the190_patent with hpmc because the422 publication disclosed using hpmc with azithromycin a compound related to clarithromycin
in response abbott points out that most inventions arise from a combination of old_elements and that` identification in the prior_art of each individual part claimed is insufficient to defeat patentability of the whole claimed invention'
*1341 abbott_labs. slip op.at 15 quoting in re kotzab 217_f.3d_1365 1370 fed.cir.2000

as mentioned above there must be some motivation suggestion or teaching of the desirability of making the specific compound
abbott argues that such a motivation is lacking here because the compounds azithromycin and clarithromycin are so different that the422 publication would not reasonably motivate a person of skill in the art to interchange the components of the formulations in the422 publication with those of the190_patent with a reasonable_expectation of success
the district_court agreed with abbott and found that because of the chemical and metabolic differences between azithromycin and clarithromycin` a person of ordinary_skill in the art would not have had a reasonable_expectation that the azithromycin formulation in the422 publication.. would lead to the features claimed in the718_patent'
id.at 16
it is in this conclusion that the district_court erred

the district_court concluded that teva had not raised a substantial_question that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have had a reasonable_expectation of success in making the claimed invention
the prior_art however especially abbotts own190_patent contradicts that conclusion
as argued by teva another claim from the190_patent merits close attention
not only does the190_patent claim compositions with clarithromycin but claim 14 of the190_patent claims` [ t ] he composition of claim 4 wherein the macrolide is selected from the group consisting of erythromycin dirithromycin azithromycin roxithromycin and abt-229'
this claim is relevant because it describes abbotts own view of the ordinary_skill in the art at the time it filed the application that led to the190_patent and it does so not by what the190_patent discloses but by what it does not disclose
claim 4_and_14 of the190_patent cover compositions that include azithromycin or clarithromycin
despite these claims to varied compositions the specification only explicitly describes compositions made from clarithromycin
we presume that abbott filed and prosecuted the190_patent representing that claim 14 of the190_patent satisfies the written description and enablement requirements of 35 u.s.c.¡± 112
see amgen inc. v. hoechst marion roussel inc. 314_f.3d_1313_(fed.cir.2003)` [ w ] e hold a presumption arises that both the claimed and unclaimed disclosures in a prior_art patent are enabled`
because the190_patent explicitly discloses only clarithromycin controlled release_compositions yet claims azithromycin compositions we conclude that abbott has represented to the u.s._patent and trademark_office` pto' that the differences between clarithromycin and azithromycin were such that azithromycin could be substituted into a controlled release_clarithromycin_composition by a person of ordinary_skill in the art without undue_experimentation
see invitrogen corp. v. clontech labs. inc. 429_f.3d_1052 1070-71 fed.cir.2005` section 112 requires that the patent specification enable those skilled in the art to make and use the full scope of the claimed invention without undue_experimentation..
the scope of enablement in turn is that which is disclosed in the specification plus the scope of what would be known to one of ordinary_skill in the art without undue_experimentation`
as a result based on abbotts own190_patent there exists a substantial_argument that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would be motivated to combine the422 publication namely the use of hpmc in extended_release macrolide *1342 compositions with the190_patent with a reasonable_expectation of success

furthermore the district_court also erred by focusing on the drugs chemical dissimilarities while not properly accounting for their similarities
it appears to have focused on the presence of differences per se rather than on those differences that would be relevant vel non to one of ordinary_skill in the art
for example the court appears to have been influenced by abbotts expert dr._banker who pointed out that the half-life of azithromycin is longer than that of clarithromycin
dr._banker also noted that clarithromycin exhibits an extensive` first-pass' metabolism to an active_metabolite whereas azithromycin does not
however the court appears to have inexplicably discounted the testimony of dr._lee
as dr._lee noted because the drug is transformed into an active_metabolite` a person skilled in the art would have expected that clarithromycin would work even better than azithromycin in an extended_release_formulation'
addressing the drugs differences in half-life and metabolism dr._lee concluded that` these characteristics further support the expectation that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have motivation and a reasonable_expectation of success in making a successful er formulation of clarithromycin..' emphasis added

in light of the record teva has raised a substantial_question that claim 4 is vulnerable to allegations of invalidity
the190_patent itself demonstrates that abbott has represented to the pto and the public in general that a person of ordinary_skill in the art can expect to successfully substitute azithromycin into a clarithromycin controlled release composition without undue_experimentation

claim 2 presents a slightly different analysis
the prior_art and the obviousness discussion from claim 4 could be applied directly to claim 2 but for the differences in pharmacokinetic_limitations
upon inspection the422 publication and the190_patent disclose compositions satisfying the pharmacokinetic_limitations of claim 2 and therefore the obviousness_arguments from above do apply and provide a substantial_argument as to the invalidity of claim 2
as discussed above where two compositions have similar aucs these compositions have similar bioavailability
the190_patent discloses compositions with similar aucs and therefore there exists a substantial_argument that it discloses compositions with substantially equivalent_bioavailability
'190_patent col. 7 table 2
thus the190_patent discloses compositions that satisfy the second of the pharmacokinetic_limitations of claim 2
furthermore although the190_patent does not explicitly disclose compositions with a lower fluctuation_index the190_patent nonetheless does so implicitly
by comparing the disclosed pharmacokinetic_parameters from the190_patent a substantial_argument exists that the190_patent also discloses compositions satisfying dfler < dflir
as discussed above the190_patent discloses pharmacokinetic_parameters that satisfy claim 4
in other_words the190_patent discloses a composition that satisfies cmax_er < cmax_ir aucer = aucir and cmin_er = cmin_ir
by examining the definitions given in the specification we conclude that the disclosed composition from the190_patent also implicitly satisfies the condition from claim 2 that dfler < dflir
by subtracting claim 4s third condition from the first one can infer that the composition from the190_patent also satisfies cmaxer-cminer < cmaxir-cminir
this inequality *1343 with the definition of the fluctuation_index and with the second limitation from claim 4 establishes that dfler= cmaxer-cminer/caver = cmaxer-cminer/aucer / £n < cmaxir-cminir/aucir / £n = cmaxir-cminir/cavir = dflir

in other_words because the190_patent disclosed a composition satisfying the pharmacokinetic_limitations of claim 4 the190_patent also disclosed compositions that satisfy dfler < dflir and are substantially bioequivalent.5 thus the obviousness_arguments relating to the190_patent and the422 publication made above for claim 4 can be applied in similar fashion to claim 2
as a result teva has also raised substantial_questions as to the validity of claim 2

b
we now turn to claim 6 of the718_patent and claim 2 of616_patent6 in its analysis the district began by looking to the claims
claim 2 of the616_patent sets forth

a method of reducing gastrointestinal_adverse_side_effects comprising administering an effective_amount of an extended_release_pharmaceutical_composition comprising an erythromycin_derivative and a pharmaceutically acceptable_polymer wherein the erythromycin_derivative is clarithromycin
'616_patent col._12,_ll._39-46
for these claims` erythromycin_derivative' and` pharmaceutically acceptable_polymer' are construed as they are construed in claims 2_and_4 of the718_patent discussed above
as to claim 2 the district_court relied on the plain_meaning of` reducing gastrointestinal_adverse_side_effects'
at the district_court teva argued that
[ w ] ell before the invention of the patent adverse gastrointestinal effects were widely known as side_effects of both erythromycin and clarithromycin and to a lesser degree azithromycin
in addition persons skilled in the art knew that one way to reduce these gastrointestinal effects was to formulate the drug in a polymer_matrix e.g. an extended_release_formulation
the gi_side_effects of clarithromycin were known to be dependent on the drug_concentration in the blood
moreover the422 [ publication ] for extended_release azithromycin disclosed that extended_release_compositions of that closely-related compound reduced gastrointestinal_side_effects
abbott_labs. slip op.at 21
in contrast abbott argued inter_alia that` the gastrointestinal_side_effects of different active pharmaceutical agents are so distinct that *1344 the pharmacokinetic properties of a formulation with one drug are not predictive of a similar formulation with another drug'
id

after reviewing the prior_art the district_court concluded that
abbott has failed to meet its burden of demonstrating that tevas opposition lacks substantial_merit
this court finds that the prior_art specifically the discussions in industry treatises and medical journals of formulations that reduced gi irritation the teachings of the422 [ publication ] and the reference material in the physicians desk reference regarding side_effects would lead a person of ordinary_skill in the art to expect that an extended_release_formulation of clarithromycin would reduce adverse_gi_side_effects
id.at 22

claim 6 of the718_patent claims
an extended_release_pharmaceutical_composition comprising an erythromycin_derivative and a pharmaceutically acceptable_polymer the composition having an improved taste_profile as compared to the immediate_release_formulation
'718_patent col._12,_ll._23-27
as to claim 6 the district_court specifically construed the term` taste_profile' noting that the specification of the718_patent describes` taste_profile' in parentheses immediately following the words` taste_perversion'
'718_patent col._9,_ll._23-24
the specification defines` taste_perversion' as` the perception of a bitter metallic taste normally associated with the erythromycin_derivatives particularly with clarithromycin'
'718_patent col._3,_ll._53-55
based on this usage in the specification the district_court concluded that` taste_perversion' and` taste_profile' are` used synonymously'
abbott_labs. slip op.at 19

at the district_court teva argued that` [ i ] t was known that clarithromycin caused taste_perversion and this created a motivation for formulators to try to create an extended_release_formulation that would have a [ n ] improved taste_profile
as support teva cited a 1993 article written by abbott researchers discussing the pharmacokinetics of single- and multiple-dose clarithromycin'
id.at 19 citations omitted
furthermore teva also relied on pfizers422 publication which as discussed above disclosed extended_release_formulations for amelioration of other macrolide related side_effects
abbott argued that only its own study by its researchers mentioned taste_perversion
the other references like the422 publication either describe other non-taste related side_effects or they describe` taste masking' rather than` taste_perversion'
id
furthermore as to its one study abbott argued that the mere fact that taste_perversion is mentioned does not make claim 6 obvious and additionally that teva had not even shown evidence that taste_perversion is dose dependent

after weighing the prior_art the district_court
agree [ d ] with abbott that teva has not met its burden of raising a substantial_question as to the validity of claim 6
teva relies primarily on only one study cited apparently in only one article that mentions taste_perversion as a known side_effect of clarithromycin and even then in only one of thirty-eight research_subjects
this court finds that teva has failed to provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that improved taste_profile as a result of an extended_release_formulation of clarithromycin would have been *1345 obvious to an ordinary person skilled in the art
id.at 20

the district_court concluded that teva failed to raise a substantial_question as to claim 6 of the718_patent but the district_court found teva had raised a substantial_question as to the validity of claim 2 of the616_patent

1
the district_court properly construed the claims for the purposes of the preliminary_injunction
`` erythromycin derivative' and` pharmaceutically acceptable_polymer' are construed as above
furthermore for claim 2 of the616_patent reducing gastrointestinal_side_effects is given its plain_meaning while for claim 6 of the718_patent` taste_profile' is read as synonymous with` taste_perversion'

2
we now turn to the obviousness_contentions based on the above construction of claim 2_and_6
even though claim 2 is a method claim and claim 6 is a composition they both deal with er compositions of erythromycin_derivatives combined with pharmaceutically acceptable_polymers that can improve adverse side_effects compared to the ir compositions
as a result the obviousness analysis is quite similar for both claims
claim 2 addresses reducing adverse_gi_side_effects while claim 6 addresses improving the taste_profile

these two claims have three major components
they require an erythromycin_derivative a polymer and they each recite improvement of a side_effect taste_perversion for claim 6 of the718_patent and gi_side_effects for claim 2 of the616_patent
following the discussion above of claim 2_and_4 of the718_patent there are substantial_arguments that an extended_release_formulation with an erythromycin_derivative and an acceptable_polymer would have been obvious in light of the prior_art.7 the validity of claim 2 and claim 6 likely hinges on the extra limitations regarding the claimed improved side-effects
in its brief on appeal abbott contends that` [ t ] he inventions of the patents in suit decrease the incidence and severity of two primary side_effects of clarithromycin taste_perversion and gastrointestinal distress.. [ t ] hese discoveries form the basis of claim 6 of the718_patent and claim 2 of the616_patent respectively'
as to such claims this court has stated that` when unexpected_results are used as evidence of nonobviousness the results must be shown to be unexpected compared with the closest prior_art'
in re baxter travenol labs. 952_f.2d_388 392 fed.cir.1991 citing in re de blauwe 736_f.2d_699 705 fed.cir.1984

the prior_art and abbotts own_statements in its briefs indicate that the reduction of systemic_side_effects would not be surprising and would not be unexpected
this therefore raises a substantial_question as to the validity of the claims
first as to the gi_side-effects the district_court found that the` gi_side_effects of clarithromycin were known to be dependent on the drug_concentration in the blood'
abbott_labs. slip op.at 21
furthermore the district_court found that abbott contended that` an extended_release_formulation *1346 would reduce the maximum blood plasma concentration of the drug'
id
thus the resulting reduction in gi_side-effects can not be said to be unexpected and the district_court correctly found that teva raised a substantial_question as to the invalidity of claim 2 of the616_patent

second as to taste_perversion teva points to a number of prior_art_references including a study conducted by abbott described in s.-y
chu et al. single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of clarithromycin a new macrolide antimicrobial 33 j. clin
pharmacol
719-26 1993
the article describes a study of single and multiple dose trials of clarithromycin and it reported the side_effects encountered by participants including taste_perversion
at the district_court abbott argued` that tevas reliance on [ this ] abbott study disclosed in the journal of clinical pharmacology overstates its case
only one of thirty eight subjects reported taste_perversion as a side_effect and only at one of four different dosage levels'
abbott_labs. slip op.at 19
the district_court seemingly agreeing with abbotts view of that reference concluded that` this court agrees with abbott that teva has not met its burden of raising a substantial_question as to the validity of claim 6
teva relies primarily on only one study cited apparently in only one article that mentions taste_perversion as a known side_effect of clarithromycin and even then in only one of thirty-eight research_subjects'
abbott_labs. slip op.at 20

upon examining that reference we can not agree with abbotts or the district_courts characterization
in the study two groups of participants underwent differing treatment protocols
see chu supra at 721
a group of twenty underwent both a single 250 mg_clarithromycin_protocol and a multiple 250 mg_clarithromycin_protocol
id
from among these two 250 mg_protocols no participants reported taste_perversion as a side-effect
id
another group of eighteen participants underwent both a single 500 mg_protocol and a multiple 500 mg dose protocol
id
from among these protocols one participant in each of the 500 mg_protocols reported taste_perversion
id
thus out of the four trials neither of 250 mg_protocols produced taste_perversion as a side-effect while each 500 mg trial produced one reported case of taste_perversion
therefore abbott is incorrect in stating that the study only reported taste_perversion at one of four dosage levels
admittedly finding 0 out of 20 cases in neither 250 mg dosage protocols and 1 out of 18 cases in each 500 mg_protocol does not establish that taste_perversion is dose dependent but it does support such arguments
furthermore as a general matter the prior_art also suggests that a known advantage of a sustained-release_formulation is` a decrease or elimination of both local and systemic_side_effects'
charles s.l
chiao & joseph r. robinson sustained-released drug delivery systems in remington the science and practice of pharmacy 1660 1662 a.r.gennaro ed.1995
lastly abbott states that` taste_perversion is different from simply anunpleasant taste of the drug when first ingested.. rather it refersto the continuing effect of the drug upon the sense of taste while the drug remains in the bloodstream..` in other_words taste_perversion is not related to a direct local taste sensation from the drug on the tongue but is rather a systemic side_effect
in regard to systemic_side_effects generally abbott states that` side_effects can be either systemic-in which case they correlate to overall drug levels in blood-or local-in which case they correlate *1347 with the levels of drug being released at the site of irritation'
from these statements abbot suggests that systemic_side_effects like taste_perversion correlate with overall drug blood levels
thus abbotts own_statements from its brief support the argument that reduction of taste_perversion would not be unexpected when an extended_release_formulation lowers the concentration of the drug in the blood.8 based on these references and statements a substantial_question exists that the improvement of the taste_perversion side-effect would not be unexpected in an extended_release_formulation of clarithromycin

teva has raised a substantial_question as to the validity of claim 6 of the718_patent and claim 2 of the616_patent9 the district_court was correct in concluding that teva had also raised a substantial_question as to invalidity of claim 2 of the616_patent and therefore claim 2 can not provide an alternative_grounds for affirming the preliminary_injunction
furthermore as discussed above teva has raised a substantial_question as to the validity of claims 2_and_4 of the718_patent
as a result it has raised a substantial_question of validity with each of the asserted claims but as in amazon.com our decision today in no way resolves the ultimate_question of invalidity
nonetheless for the purposes of the preliminary_injunction_abbott as the moving party has not established a likelihood of success on the merits

iv
turning now to the other_factors in a motion for preliminary_injunction the district_court concluded that abbott established irreparable_harm
see ebay inc. 126 s.ct.at 1839` according to well-established principles of equity a plaintiff seeking a permanent injunction must satisfy a four-factor_test before a court may grant such relief..
these familiar_principles apply with equal_force to disputes arising under the patent_act`
the district_court presumed abbott would suffer irreparable_harm absent the injunction because of its conclusion regarding likelihood of success on the merits
furthermore and in addition to the presumption the district_court considered abbotts economic consequences of denying the injunction and it concluded that` entry of the generic_extended_release_formulation_competitor will likely crush the market'
abbott_labs. slip op.at 27
on appeal the parties dispute whether the district_court properly concluded that abbott would suffer irreparable_harm if the injunction were not issued
teva argues that any harm that abbott may suffer could be remedied by monetary compensation
abbott responds by contending that the sharp economic consequences of open competition from generic drugs establish the inadequacy of monetary_damages and irreparable_harm

first as noted above we conclude that abbott has not established a likelihood of success on the merits
as a result abbott is no longer entitled to a presumption of irreparable_harm
see reebok int l ltd. v. j. baker inc. 32_f.3d_1552 1556 fed.cir.1994
and as to abbotts economic *1348 arguments we do not doubt that generic_competition will impact abbotts sales of biaxin_xl but that alone does not establish that abbotts harm will be irreparable
as we stated in illinois tool works inc. v. grip-pak inc. if this court were to accept a patentees` argu [ ments ] thatapart from the presumption itspotential lost sales alone demonstratemanifest irreparable_harm acceptance of that position would require a finding of irreparable_harm to every manufacturer/patentee regardless of circumstances'
906_f.2d_679_(fed.cir.1990)
on the other hand we also note that the district_court found that` the parties models of how the market will react to generic_competition for extended_release clarithromycin remain highly speculative' and teva has not proven that monetary_damages will suffice
abbott_labs. slip op.at 27
therefore where a patentee has not shown a likelihood of success on the merits and where the patentee has not clearly established that monetary_damages could not suffice but the defendant has not established that monetary_damages do suffice we can not say that the irreparable_harm prong of the analysis favors either party

as to the third prong of the analysis the district_court stated that teva was` reluctan [ t ] or inab [ le ] to quantify the hardship if any it will face if an injunction is incorrectly entered' and` there is little_choice but to conclude that the balance of hardships favors [ abbott ]'
abbott_labs. slip op.at 30-31
as teva does not appeal this issue we also conclude that the district_court properly found that the balance of hardships favors abbott

lastly as to the public_interest factor the district_court determined that` [ t ] o the extent that this court has found that the patents in suit are valid the public_interest is best served by enforcing them'
id. slip op.at 32
although the public_interest inquiry is not necessarily or always bound to the likelihood of success of the merits in this case absent any other relevant concerns we agree with the district_court that the public is best served by enforcing patents that are likely valid and infringed
as abbott did not establish a likelihood of success on the merits we conclude that the public_interest is best served by denying the preliminary_injunction

v. first in determining abbotts likelihood of success on the merits the district_court clearly erred in assessing the content of the prior_art
the prior_art supports teva arguments and teva has raised a substantial_question regarding the validity of claims 2 4 and 6 of the718 and claim 2 of the616_patent
we conclude that abbott has not established a likelihood of success on the merits and this supports denying the injunction
second absent the presumption of irreparable_harm and in light of the arguable sufficiency of monetary_damages abbott has not established that irreparable_harm supports the grant of the injunction
third as the issue was uncontested the balance of hardship still supports the grant of the injunction
fourth and lastly as a substantial_question of patent_validity has been raised by teva the public_interest benefits from a denial of the injunction
as result of these considerations we vacate the preliminary_injunction

vacated
newman circuit_judge dissenting
it has been confirmed that the remedy of injunction in patent cases is subject to *1349 the sound_discretion of the district_court upon application of the traditional criteria by which injunctive_relief is evaluated and applied
ebay inc. v. mercexchange l.l.c. 547_u.s._388 -- -- 126_s.ct._1837 1841 164_l.ed.2d_641_(2006)` we hold only that the decision whether to grant or deny injunctive_relief rests within the equitable_discretion of the district_courts and that such discretion must be exercised consistent with traditional_principles of equity in patent disputes no less than in other cases governed by such standards'

these traditional_principles are no less applicable when a preliminary_injunction is at issue particularly when the purpose is to preserve-not to change-the relationship of the litigants during the litigation
`` the purpose of a preliminary_injunction is to preserve the relative positions of the parties until a trial on the merits can be held'
univ
of texas v. camenisch 451_u.s._390 395 101_s.ct._1830 68_l.ed.2d_175_(1981) ; smith int l inc. v. hughes tool co. 718_f.2d_1573 1578 fed.cir.1983` a preliminary_injunction will normally issue only for the purpose of preserving the status_quo and protecting the respective rights of the parties pending final disposition of the litigation'
precedent counsels against making an important change in the relationship of the parties while their dispute is being litigated while recognizing that there may be circumstances warranting such change when all of the legal and equitable aspects relevant to a particular case are considered
see e.g. mikohn gaming corp. v. acres gaming inc. 165_f.3d_891 895 fed.cir.1998 the preliminary_injunction serves to preserve the status_quo` lest one side prevent resolution of the questions or execution of any judgment by altering the status_quo' ; globetrotter software inc. v. elan computer group inc. 236_f.3d_1363 1367 fed.cir.2001

the trial_courts decision with respect to the discretionary grant of a preliminary_injunction warrants significant deference for equitable considerations weigh heavily in matters of change or stability pendente lite
see deckert v. independence shares corp. 311_u.s._282 290 61_s.ct._229 85_l.ed._189_(1940)`it is well settled that the granting of a temporary injunction pending final hearing is within the sound_discretion of the trial_court ; and that upon appeal an order granting such an injunction will not be disturbed unless contrary to some rule of equity or the result of improvident exercise of judicial discretion
`` ; meccano ltd. v. john wanamaker new_york 253_u.s._136 141 40_s.ct._463 64_l.ed._822_(1920)` the correct general doctrine is that whether a preliminary_injunction shall be awarded rests in sound_discretion of the trial_court`
it is particularly irregular for an appellate court to reverse this discretionary_decision and thereby to make a significant change in the relationship of the parties while presenting no explanation of how the district_court abused its discretion

reversal of a preliminary_injunction that preserves the status_quo requires a clear showing that the district_court exceeded its discretionary authority
see we care inc. v. ultra-mark int l corp. 930_f.2d_1567 1570 fed.cir.1991` the courts determination can be overturned only on a showing that it abused its discretion committed an error of law or seriously misjudged the evidence'
my colleagues do not discuss the trial judges careful explanations but upon finding that teva has raised a` substantial_question' about patent_validity they hold that teva should be permitted to practice the abbott_invention before patent_validity is decided
with all respect to my colleagues concerns they misapply not only the criteria of the preliminary_injunction *1350 but also the standard of appellate review

first as to patent_validity the panel_majority rejects the requirement that in determining the likelihood that the patent will be proved invalid it is necessary to consider the burdens of proof that would inhere at trial
see canon computer sys. inc. v. nu-kote int l. inc. 134_f.3d_1085 1088 fed.cir.1998` however a patent is presumed valid and this presumption exists at every stage of the litigation
`` ; genentech inc. v. novo_nordisk a/s 108_f.3d_1361 1364 fed.cir.1997 criterion` substantial_questions of validity' means that` in light of the presumptions and burdens that will inhere at trial on the merits' the attacker has` a likelihood of success' in invalidating the patent ; ppg indus. inc. v. guardian indus. inc. 75_f.3d_1558_(fed.cir.1996)` the ultimate_question however is whether the challengers evidence of invalidity is sufficiently persuasive that it is likely to overcome the presumption of patent_validity'
in the case now before us the district_court analyzed the evidence in which technologically complex questions are presented and concluded that teva was not likely to prove the patent invalid by clear and convincing evidence
in contrast the panel_majority holds that if the attacker raises no more than a` substantial_question' of invalidity that suffices to establish the likelihood that the attacker will succeed on the merits
that is incorrect in law and in procedure

next even as the panel_majority states its agreement with the district_courts finding that` the balance of hardships favors abbott' maj. op.at 30 the majority declines to weigh this factor in its decision
see chrysler motors corp. v. auto body panels of ohio inc. 908_f.2d_951_(fed.cir.1990)` our rule regarding whether a preliminary_injunction should be granted or denied is that the trial_court should weigh and measure each of the four factors against the other_factors and against the magnitude of the relief requested`
abbott points out that the status_quo ante will not easily be recoverable if interim infringement is authorized ; abbott also points out that there is no patent barrier to tevas entry into commerce with its own extended_release_formulation instead of that of abbott for the basic patent on clarithromycin has expired
thus the panel_majority again applies a flawed methodology for` where it is clear that the moving party will suffer substantially greater harm by the denial of the preliminary_injunction than the non-moving party would by its grant it will ordinarily be sufficient that the movant has raisedserious substantial difficult and doubtful questions that are the proper subject of litigation'
ugine-savoie imphy v. united states 121_f.supp.2d_684 689 ct. int l trade 2000
the district_courts consideration of this aspect was proper and warrants appellate deference

next the panel_majority states that the question of the sufficiency of money damages is` arguable' -ignoring the district_courts finding that this aspect may also favor abbott
instead the majority_opinion announces that this aspect will not be considered at all
on this accumulation of flaws and with no reference to the district_courts well reasoned opinion my colleagues reverse the preliminary_injunction change the status_quo and authorize infringement before validity is decided
i must respectfully dissent

the considerations pendente lite
at issue are claims 2 4 and 6 of u.s._patent_no._6010,718 the718_patent and claim 2 of *1351 u.s._patent_no._6551,616 the616_patent
the claims are directed to an extended-release_formulation of erythromycin in a polymer_matrix and require that the minimum_plasma_concentration for the extended_release_formulation is substantially equivalent to that of the immediate_release_formulation ; that is the drug is released so as to be present in the plasma at the same_minimum_level for both the immediate_release and extended_release_formulations and with less fluctuation for the extended_release product

in the challenge to validity teva and abbott both presented extensive argument and briefing citing various references
the district_court explaining its decision on the question of tevas likelihood of success in proving the patents invalid analyzed the evidence and concluded this court finds that teva has failed to raise a substantial_question as to the validity of abbotts claims 2_and_4
the prior_art cited by teva discloses discrete_portions of the asserted claims but teva fails to demonstrate that this would be sufficient to give a person of ordinary_skill in the art a reasonable_expectation of success
tevas prior_art_references reveal that using hpmc was a logical_line of inquiry but the dissimilarities between the drugs with which hpmc had been successfully combined and clarithromycin_defeat_tevas claim of obviousness
the district_court included discussion of the issues and arguments presented by the parties remarked on the uses of various known release agents and the unpredictability of achieving successful extended_release as to any particular product
the record shows discussion at the district_court that the metabolic pathway of the active_ingredient must be determined as well as the physical and chemical properties and physiologic behavior and effectiveness of the metabolites and their interaction with the materials in the extended_release_formulation
the record shows discussion at the district_court of the need for extended_release performance that will produce an effective drug exposure in the bloodstream over the entire release period and the unpredictability of this performance
the record shows discussion of the non-linear pharmacokinetics1 exhibited by clarithromycin
the district_court explained its decision that teva had not shown that it was likely to prove invalidity of the claimed formulations

this court is mindful of the federal_circuits warning about the risk of the` hindsight trap' or the post facto belief that an invention which seems obvious once created would have been obvious to people skilled in the art at the time
abbott has provided ample_evidence that its invention was not obvious and that there were many other extended_release_formulation methods known in the prior_art
in fact the existence of alternate methods and the attempted exploitation of some of those methods provide secondary considerations of nonobviousness
these factors suggest that there was a long-felt need for the invention that others including abbott initially failed to develop the invention and go a long way to account for the commercial success that abbott has unquestionably enjoyed with its biaxin xl product
the panel_majority does not discuss and assigns no flaw to the district_courts refusal *1352 to apply judicial hindsight ; nonetheless the majority applies such hindsight for itself starting with the template of the abbott_invention and then selecting portions of references to reconstruct the invention within that template
to guard against such incorrect analysis precedent teaches that references can not be selected and selected elements from selected references can not be combined without some suggestion motivation or teaching that would make obvious that selection and that combination
see e.g. karsten mfg corp. v. cleveland golf co. 242_f.3d_1376 1385 58_uspq2d_1286 1293 fed.cir.2001` in holding an invention obvious in view of a combination of references there must be some suggestion motivation or teaching in the prior_art that would have led a person of ordinary_skill in the art to select the references and combine them in the way that would produce the claimed invention
`` ; brown & williamson tobacco corp. v. philip morris inc. 229_f.3d_1120 1124-25 fed.cir.2000` a showing of a suggestion teaching or motivation to combine the prior_art_references is anessential component of an obviousness holding`
the panel_majority acknowledges the law but finds a motivation to make the claimed formulation by combining the information in abbotts prior_art patent no._5705,190 which shows extended_release_formulations of clarithromycin and azithromycin in` alginate' a known release agent derived from seaweed with a pfizer publication designated wo 95/30422 which shows the hpmc hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose of the718_patent used with azithromycin
abbott stated at the preliminary_injunction hearing that what works for a product in an alginate_matrix is not predictably applicable to other products ; this statement was not contradicted
the district_court analyzed the interchangeability of clarithromycin and azithromycin stating the questions are how similar and dissimilar are the two molecules ; and what are the implications of these similarities and dissimilarities to a person of ordinary_skill in the art in light of prior_art at the time of the invention
specifically would a person of ordinary_skill in the art have had a reasonable_expectation of success in creating an extended_release_formulation of clarithromycin using a hydrophilic_water-soluble_polymer based on the prior_art including the422_patent for an extended_release_formulation of azithromycin with such a polymer ?
the court concluded that they were not so similar as to be interchangeable in the context of polymers like hpmc correctly rejecting the argument that` obvious to try' can establish obviousness
the court stated tevas prior_art_references reveal that using hpmc was a logical_line of inquiry but the dissimilarities between the drugs with which hpmc had been successfully combined and clarithromycin_defeat_tevas claim of obviousness
my colleagues ignore the district_courts analysis offering neither deference nor acknowledgment
instead the panel_majority explains that its finding of likelihood of success in proving obviousness is supported` not by what the190_patent discloses but what it does not disclose' emphasis in maj
op
) proposing that` abbott has represented to the u.s._patent and trademark_office that the differences between clarithromycin and azithromycin were such that azithromycin could be substituted into a controlled release_clarithromycin_composition by a person of *1353 ordinary_skill in the art without undue_experimentation'
maj. op.at 17-18
thus my colleagues conclude that claim 4 of the718_patent is` vulnerable to allegations of invalidity' and find` a substantial_argument' as to other claims
these are not the criteria of likelihood of success

reversible error has not been shown in the district_courts analysis and no basis whatsoever has been shown for overturning the courts discretionary_decision to preserve the status_quo while the matter is litigated
even if teva had raised a substantial_argument as my colleagues find the criteria of abuse of discretion have not been met
to support a change in the status_quo before the merits are decided it must be shown to be likely that the patent will be held invalid under the presumptions and burdens in effect at trial
the panel_majority is incorrect in holding that it` require [ s ] less_proof' to authorize infringement before the merits are decided ; such a rule whereby a patent is deprived of exclusivity during litigation is not readily invoked for it is excessively disruptive of the processes of law
as the court said in ebay v. mercexchange` as this court has long recognized a major departure from the long tradition of equity practice should not be lightly implied
`` 126 s.ct.at 1839 quoting weinberger v. romero-barcelo 456_u.s._305 320 102_s.ct._1798 72_l.ed.2d_91_(1982)

conclusion
the district_courts conclusion as to the challengers likelihood of success in invalidating all of the claims in suit and the district_courts view of the balance of harms are well reasoned and fully supported by precedent
the district_courts ruling preserving the status_quo during litigation warrants and requires our deference
from my colleagues de novo and incorrect contrary ruling i must respectfully dissent

abbott also alleged infringement of u.s._patent_no._6872,407 and u.s._patent 4,680,386 but as this case is a limited appeal of the district_courts grant of a preliminary_injunction under 28 u.s.c.¡± 1292 c 1 and that preliminary_injunction did not extend to the claims of the 6,872 407_or_4680,386 patent those two patents are not before us today and will not be discussed

the dissent appears to take issue with the conclusion that a likelihood of success on the merits is not found where there exists a substantial_question of validity
the majority_opinion however is duty bound by our precedent which states exactly this proposition
in genentech inc. v. novo_nordisk a/s this court stated that
in order to demonstrate that it has a likelihood of success genentech must show that in light of the presumptions and burdens that will inhere at trial on the merits 1 it will likely prove that novo infringes the199_patent and 2 its infringement claim will likely withstand novos challenges to the validity and enforceability of the199_patent
in other_words if novo raises asubstantial_question concerning validity enforceability or infringement i.e. asserts a defense that genentech can not showlacks substantial_merit the preliminary_injunction should not issue
more specifically with regard to novos validity defenses the question on appeal is whether the [ defenses have ] substantial_merit.. 108_f.3d_1361 1364 fed.cir.1997 ; see also tate access floors inc. v. interface architectural res. inc. 279_f.3d_1357 1365 fed.cir.2002 purdue pharma l.p. v. boehringer ingelheim gmbh 237_f.3d_1359 1363 fed.cir.2001 helifix ltd. v. blok-lok ltd. 208_f.3d_1339 1351 fed.cir.2000

claim 2 of the718_patent depends from independent claim 1
the language recited for claim 2 includes the combined limitations of claim 1 and claim 2
4
there is little in the patent itself that establishes the differences if any between parameters that are simply` lower' rather than` statistically significantly lower' and the specification does not explicitly define when two parameters are` substantially equivalent'
for purposes of this preliminary_injunction we do not reach these more nuanced issues in claim construction
5
as mentioned above though the inequality follows strictly from satisfying the conditions of claim 4 this does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the fluctuation_index of the extended_release_formulation is` statistically significantly lower' than the immediate_release
but nonetheless the result derived here is enough to show that teva has produced substantial_argument as to the invalidity of claim 2
this is true despite the example given in the718_patent analyzing formula_a from the190_patent for its pharmacokinetic_parameters718_patent col._10,_ll._62-67 most notably because formula_c not formula_a from the190_patent appears to satisfy the pharmacokinetic_limitations of claims 2_and_4 of the718_patent
6
the district_court concluded that teva had made a substantial_argument as to the invalidity of claim 2 of the616_patent
in this appeal abbott argues that claim 2 of the616 could form an alternative basis for upholding the preliminary_injunction and therefore we also review the parties arguments as to the validity of claim 2
7
as opposed to claim 2_and_4 of the718_patent claim 6 of the718 and claim 2 of the616 do not limit their claimed extended_release_formulations with any specific_pharmacokinetic_parameters
8
this does not mean to suggest that lowering drug_concentration will lead inexorably to improved side_effects ; rather it only suggests that such an improvement would not be unexpected
9
other arguments as to obviousness may also have merit such as arguments relating to inherency
see e.g. in re wiseman 596_f.2d_1019_(ccpa_1979)
but as the arguments relating to unexpected_results demonstrate the vulnerability of the claims to invalidity we do not reach these other related obviousness_arguments

abbott explains that` non-linear' here means that the amount of drug in the blood is not directly proportional to the dosage amount but increases disproportionately with higher doses
this is not a characteristic of azithromycin the product whose formulation is relied on by the panel_majority as discussed infra
