background
boston_scientific_scimed inc. and boston_scientific_corporation collectively` boston_scientific' own the ¡¬536_patent which relates to a drug-eluting expandable_stent with a coating that has a non-thrombogenic surface
boston_scientific sued cordis in march 2003 alleging inter alia that cordiss cypher_stent infringed claim *984 8 of the ¡¬536_patent
claim 8 the only claim on appeal depends from claim 6 which depends from claim 1
claims 1 6 and 8 read as follows 1
a medical_device having at least a portion which is implantable into the body of a patient wherein at least a part of the device_portion is metallic and at least part of the metallic device_portion is covered with a coating for release of at least one biologically active_material wherein said coating comprises an undercoat comprising a hydrophobic elastomeric material incorporating an amount of biologically active_material therein for timed release therefrom and wherein said coating further comprises a topcoat which at least partially covers the undercoat said topcoat comprising a biostable non-thrombogenic material which provides long_term nonthromobogenicity to the device_portion during and after release of the biologically active_material and wherein said topcoat is substantially free of an elutable_material
6
the device of claim 1 wherein the medical_device is an expandable_stent
8
the device of claim 6 wherein the stent comprises a tubular body having open ends and an open_lattice sidewall structure and wherein the coating conforms to said sidewall structure in a manner that preserves said open_lattice
¡¬536_patent col. 13 l.13-col. 14 l.4 filed june_13,_1996

in june 2005 the district_court construed certain limitations of claim 8
the court held that the phrase` non-thrombogenic material which provides long_term non-thrombogenicity to the device_portion during and after release of the biologically active_material' in claim 1 means` a material that does not promote thrombosis for a period of time that extends both during and after release of the biologically active_material'
claim_construction_opinion 2005 u.s._dist
lexis 10735 at *3 2005_wl_1322946 at *1
the court relied on medical dictionary_definitions for the meaning of` thrombogenic'` causing thrombosis or coagulation of the blood' and` thrombolytic'` break [ ing ] up or dissolv [ ing ] a thrombus'` thrombolytic' being a term the patentee used in the specification but not the claims
id.at *big_token__3_n._6__big_token 2005_wl_1322946 at *big_token__1_n._6__big_token
the court rejected cordiss proposed definition of` non-thrombogenic' which required a` significant reduction in thrombogenicity over that experienced with bare_metal_stents'
id.at *big_token__4_n._7__big_token 2005_wl_1322946 at *1 n.7
the court also construed the phrase` substantially free of an elutable_material' to mean` largely or approximately free of an elutable_material'
id.at *4 2005_wl_1322946 *1

cordis makes the cypher drug-eluting expandable_stent
the cypher_stent has two coatings an undercoat containing the drug and a topcoat
early in the manufacturing process the cypher_stents topcoat is drug-free
the topcoat is sprayed on as a solution containing no drug but containing a polymer and two solvents tetrahydrofuran or thf and toluene both of which are toxic to humans
the solvents dissolve the drug allowing it to diffuse from the undercoat into the topcoat
thus when the cypher_stent is sterilized removing any remaining solvent the drug has moved into the topcoat to such an extent that the topcoat and undercoat contain the same concentration of drug
the topcoat is thinner than the undercoat ; it contains about 23 % of the total amount of the drug in the stent after sterilization

at trial the jury found that claim 8 of the ¡¬536_patent would not have been obvious based on among other prior_art references u.s._patent 5,545,208` wolff' and u.s._patent 5,512,055` domb'
the jury *985 also found that the cypher_stent infringed claim 8
after trial cordis filed a renewed motion for jmol or in the alternative a new_trial on infringement and validity
the court denied cordiss motion

in doing so the district_court upheld the jurys nonobviousness finding over domb wolff and several other_references
the court reasoned that domb which discloses esophageal stents does not suggest the use of metal in a stent and that there was no evidence of motivation to combine domb with other_references
opinion_denying_jmol 434 f.supp.2d at 320
the court reasoned that wolff according to one expert does not teach a metallic_stent having a two-layer_coating and the failure of wolffs assignee to create the claimed stent after more than a decade of work evidenced a lack of motivation to combine the features of its various prior_art stents with each other
id
finally as a secondary_consideration of nonobviousness the court found from expert testimony that the praise for and commercial success of the cypher_stent were due to the claimed features and that even after identifying an appropriate drug and stent it took cordis a great deal of time to develop a drug-eluting_stent
id.at 321

regarding infringement the district_court reasoned that the jurys infringement finding was based on substantial_evidence because three experts had testified that cypher was non-thrombogenic
id.at 316-17
as for the` substantially free' limitation the court found support for the jurys infringement finding in a witnesss testimony that the topcoat is drug-free when applied and` has about 1_to_2 %_drug.. after manufacturing is completed' finding that 1_to_2 %_drug may be considered` substantially free'
id.at 315
the court also pointed to evidence that a stent need not be sterilized to be implantable and thus that the stent could infringe during manufacture when the topcoat was first applied and was then drug-free
id
the court referred to testimony that concluded after applying the courts claim_construction that the cypher_stent was substantially free of elutable_material
id
finally the court found that the ¡¬536_patent specifically contemplates that the drug will move into the topcoat prior to implantation implying that the` substantially free' limitation does not preclude the topcoat from containing 23 % of the drug
id
the court thus held that the jurys finding of infringement was based on substantial_evidence

after the district_court denied cordiss motions cordis again moved for a new_trial based on newly discovered evidence that the fda had found an increased risk of thrombosis in patients who had been treated with drug-eluting_stents
thus according to cordis the cypher_stent could not` provide [ ] long_term non-thrombogenicity'
¡¬536_patent col.13 ll.23-24
the court denied cordiss second motion for a new_trial because the fda had opined that an increased risk of death and heart attack was only possibly due to stent thrombosis and thus that the new_evidence was too speculative to warrant either dismissal or a new_trial
opinion denying new trial 2007_wl_2775087 at *3

cordis timely appealed the district_courts claim_construction the denial of jmol on both obviousness and noninfringement and the denial of a new_trial
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

discussion
a
claim construction
1
construction of` non-thrombogenic' cordis asserts that the district_court erred by declining to construe the *986` non-thrombogenic' limitation to require less thrombogenicity than an uncoated metal_stent
cordis argues that according to the language of claim 8 the specification and the prosecution_history the non-thrombogenic material must have an effect different from the stents natural effect and that the specification itself compares the invention to metal_stents
also according to cordis boston_scientific admits that` non-thrombogenic' is a relative term requiring a comparison and it waived any argument that the comparison should be to rough porous coatings as opposed to bare_metal_stents
cordis also argues that the court should not have relied on dictionary_definitions especially of unclaimed terms
cordis asserts that undisputed evidence showed that cypher_stents and bare-metal_stents were equally thrombogenic such that cypher_stents would not infringe under the correct claim_construction
although cordis publicly declared that its stents were non-thrombogenic seemingly meeting the claim_language and thus infringing cordis argues that its public statements used the term in a different sense from the patent and that its stents do not infringe

boston_scientific responds that nothing in the specification or prosecution_history requires a comparison with bare_metal_stents ; any comparison is to other coatings that promote thrombosis so even if the cypher_stent were more thrombogenic than a bare_metal_stent it would still infringe
indeed boston_scientific points out that the claim_language allows some metal to be left uncoated so that a comparison to bare_metal_stents would not make sense
according to boston_scientific the courts definition conforms with both the ordinary meaning and experts definitions of` non-thrombogenic'
boston_scientific adds that the cypher_stent infringes claim 8 of the ¡¬536_patent under either the district_courts claim_construction or cordiss proposed claim_construction
boston_scientific notes that cordis admitted in fda submissions and promotional literature that the cypher coating is` non-thrombogenic'
boston_scientific also points out that cordis uses toluene to smooth the surface and remove pores preventing thrombosis indicating that its stents are non-thrombogenic
finally according to boston_scientific a new claim_construction would require a remand to allow boston_scientific to present a new infringement case

we review claim_construction de novo on appeal
cybor corp. v. fas techs. inc. 138_f.3d_1448 1456 fed.cir.1998 en banc
we agree with boston_scientific that the district_court reasonably construed the` non-thrombogenic' limitation to mean` a material that does not promote thrombosis for a period of time that extends both during and after release of the biologically active_material'
to determine the meaning of` non-thrombogenic' we begin by considering the language of the claims
see phillips v. awh corp. 415_f.3d_1303 1314 fed.cir.2005 en banc
the language of claim 1 requires that the non-thrombogenic topcoat material` provide [ ].. non-thrombogenicity' to the stent but it does not require a comparison to any other stent either bare metal or coated
¡¬536_patent col.13 ll.22-26
as the claims themselves provide no other insight into the meaning of` non-thrombogenic' we turn to the specification in order to determine if it provides a clearer indication of the scope of` non-thrombogenic'

`` [ c ] laims must be read in view of the specification of which they are a part'
phillips 415 f.3d at 1315 quotation_marks omitted
the abstract of the invention states that the` non-thrombogenic surface.. is provided with sites.. *987 which aid in.. reduc [ ing ] thrombogenic_activity'
¡¬536_patent abstract ; see also id.at col.2 ll.36-46 using heparin` to impart a non-thrombogenic surface to the material'
thus we can discern that the non-thrombogenic material must reduce thrombogenic_activity because of its particular properties
this conclusion accords with the fact that stents are known to promote thrombosis and the goal of the patent is to have the claimed stent promote thrombosis as little as possible or not promote thrombosis at all
however it is clear from the specification that the reduced thrombogenic_activity is not necessarily reduced from that of bare_metal_stents
indeed the specification discusses various ways of formulating a topcoat and then states that` a top coat or surface coating modified.. to make the surface more non-thrombogenic presents a distinct advantage'
id.at col.6 ll.49-55
thus the reduced thrombogenic_activity is clearly reduced from that of other coated stents whose topcoats have not been so modified

cordis argues that the prosecution_history precludes the district_courts construction of` non-thrombogenic' and that the claimed device must have had a reduced risk of thrombosis over that of a bare_metal_stent
`` [ a ] court should also consider the patents prosecution_history if it is in evidence.. like the specification the prosecution_history provides evidence of how the [ patent office ] and the inventor understood the patent'
phillips 415 f.3d at 1317 citations and quotation_marks omitted
during prosecution the applicant added the` non-thrombogenic' limitation to overcome an anticipation rejection explaining that the topcoat` renders the coated device non-thrombogenic' and arguing that the prior_art did not provide the same benefit
however the prior_art device according to the applicant was directed to` drug containing coatings.. for metal_stents'
parties joint app.at a482 prosecution_history of ¡¬536_patent amendment dated july_30,_1997
thus if the amendment required reduced_thrombogenicity over anything it would be reduced over the prior_art stent that is coated not the bare metal prior_art stent
the applicant therefore could not have considered` non-thromobogenic' to require reduced_thrombogenicity over a bare_metal_stent

cordis also argues that the district_court should not have compared dictionary_definitions of` thrombogenic' and` thrombolytic' because` thrombolytic' does not appear in the claim and because it is treated synonymously with` non-thrombogenic' in the specification
we disagree
courts may of course` rely on dictionary_definitions when construing claim_terms so long as the dictionary_definition does not contradict any definition found in or ascertained by a reading of the patent documents' phillips 415 f.3d at 1322-23 and the court here did not err in relying on dictionary_definitions to inform the meaning of the claim_terms
the district_court here permissibly looked to the definitions of` thrombogenic' and` thrombolytic' to inform the meaning of` non-thrombogenic'
because the courts definition accords with the specification prosecution_history and the dictionary_definition of a related term we affirm the district_courts definition of the term` non-thrombogenic'
we therefore need not address cordiss arguments that under a different claim_construction the cypher_stent does not infringe claim 8 of the ¡¬536_patent

2
construction of` long term' cordis also argues that the district_court erred by construing` long_term' to mean a` period of time' and abused its discretion in denying cordiss motion for a new_trial based on newly discovered data
*988 according to cordis the district_courts construction improperly erases the claim requirement of` long_term' because the claim requires both` long_term non-thrombogenicity' and that the non-thrombogenicity be provided` during and after release of the biologically active_material' whereas the courts definition only required` a period of time that extends both during and after release of the biologically active_material'
cordis argues that the courts claim_construction lessened the significance of what the specification describes as an important_objective of the invention
moreover according to cordis data that became available after the trial but before entry of judgment showed that its cypher_stent had long-term thrombosis risks and boston_scientific itself publicly stated that the cypher_stent had a higher incidence of late thrombosis than bare_metal_stents

boston_scientific responds that the` long_term' requirement has not been read out of the claim because the district_courts construction includes a time limitation
neither the specification nor the prosecution_history limits` long_term' to the phenomenon of late stent thrombosis which occurs more than one year after implantation
moreover according to boston_scientific cordis has publicly stated that the same data it now relies on is flawed
boston_scientific also argues that the data cordis seeks to include is cumulative and existed before trial so it is not new_evidence

we agree with boston_scientific that the district_court correctly construed the` long_term' aspect of the` non-thrombogenic' limitation
neither the specification nor the prosecution_history defines the period of time that is` long_term' other than to require that it be longer than two weeks ¡¬536_patent col.7 ll.1-5 and the claim_construction includes two time limitations like the claim itself
the claim_construction requires both` a period of time' and that the period` extends both during and after release of the biologically active_material'
even assuming as cordis argues that the specification describes long-term non-thrombogenicity as an important_objective of the invention it does not further elucidate the meaning of` long_term' or require that those specific words be used in the claim_construction
we thus affirm the district_courts construction of the` non-thrombogenic' limitation including the` long_term' aspect

b. validity
we next turn to the issue of the validity of the ¡¬536_patent
cordis argues that the district_court erred in denying cordiss motion for jmol of invalidity of the ¡¬536_patent on the ground of obviousness
according to cordis the wolff_patent alone renders the invention of claim 8 obvious
figure_3b of wolff shows a polymer_stent made of a drug-eluting polymer with a barrier_topcoat and wolff also refers to the stent and topcoat as separate` layers'
figure 4 of wolff then shows a metallic_stent with a drug-eluting polymer_coating and the drug-eluting polymer_coating is identified with the same numeral as the drug-eluting polymer_stent of figure_3b
cordis argues that it would have been obvious to combine wolffs figure_3b disclosing a drug-eluting polymer_stent with a drug-free coat with the possibility of additional coats and figure 4 disclosing a metal_stent with a drug-eluting polymer coat to arrive at the invention of claim 8
in figures_3b and 4 as shown in the drawing from cordiss brief reproduced below numeral 22 refers to a metal_stent numeral 14 refers to a drug-eluting polymer layer and numeral 15 refers to a separate layer of polymer that may be drug-free

*989. ?
principal br
of cordis at 56

cordis also argues that domb alone also renders claim 8 obvious because domb teaches every limitation except that the stent can be made of metal and have an open_lattice
however according to cordis both features were well known in the esophageal stent field of domb
cordis adds that at least four other_references teach implantable devices with two-layer_coatings that include a polymer undercoat containing a drug and a barrier_topcoat that controls the drugs release rate
combined according to cordis they also disclose every other limitation
finally cordis argues that witnesses described developing cypher before the ¡¬536_patents priority_date and described the ease at the time of coating stents with the two claimed coats
cordis argues that in a pre-ksr-type analysis boston_scientifics expert relied on an unduly low skill level in asserting that the prior_art did not explicitly suggest the modifications that led to the claimed invention
see ksr int l co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007)
regarding secondary_considerations of nonobviousness cordis argues that boston_scientific failed to link cyphers success to the polymer_coating

boston_scientific responds that wolff fails to recognize the additional non-thrombogenic benefits of a topcoat that is substantially drug-free over a topcoat that contains drug therefore not rendering claim 8 with its non-thrombogenic drug-free_topcoat obvious
boston_scientific also argues that wolff only discloses a single coating layer and wolff does not disclose non-thrombogenicity
although wolff discloses silicone and polyurethane as topcoat materials boston_scientific asserts that non-thrombogenicity is not inherent in those materials because non-thrombogenicity depends on surface properties such as porousness
boston_scientific adds that cordis contradicted its own noninfringement argument about non-thrombogenicity so the jury logically could have rejected both positions
boston_scientific also argues that domb does not disclose a non-thrombogenic topcoat as the stent in domb was designed to be used in the esophagus where there is no circulating blood to cause thrombosis
according to boston_scientific domb also does not teach metallic or expandable_stents
boston_scientific further argues that domb teaches away from an open_lattice_structure because an open_lattice promotes tissue in-growth while the domb stents were designed to be removable

boston_scientific argues that ksr is irrelevant to this obviousness inquiry because cordis urged no particular combination of references
as a secondary_consideration of nonobviousness boston_scientific argues that wolff and two of the other_references asserted by cordis were assigned to medtronic who failed to develop a drug-eluting_stent before the priority_date of the ¡¬ 536 patent
had it been so obvious boston_scientific argues medtronic would have made the claimed invention
also according to boston_scientific cordiss expert admitted to the *990 long-felt need to deliver drugs from stents
finally boston_scientific argues that cordiss witness stated that the success of the cypher_stent was due to the claimed polymer_coating system

we agree with cordis that wolff alone renders claim 8 of the ¡¬536_patent obvious and therefore invalid
because we hold the claim obvious based on wolff alone we do not address cordiss arguments for obviousness based on domb or any other reference

`` we review the jurys conclusions on obviousness a question of law without deference and the underlying findings of fact whether explicit or implicit within the verdict for substantial_evidence'
johns hopkins univ

while a jury may render a decision on a question of obviousness when it is considering any underlying fact questions see id. obviousness is ultimately a question of law that this court reviews de novo
when we consider that even in light of a jurys findings of fact the references demonstrate an invention to have been obvious we may reverse its obviousness determination
see richardson-vicks inc. v. upjohn co. 122_f.3d_1476 1479 fed.cir.1997` [ i ] n re-creating the facts as they may have been found by the jury and in applying the graham factors to the case we assess the record evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict winner.. though this does not mean that we are free to abdicate our role as the ultimate decision maker on the question of obviousness
that decision remains within our province'
( citation omitted
that is the case here

as we have discussed above claim 8 recites a metallic_stent with an open_lattice_structure
the stent includes an undercoat and a topcoat
the undercoat contains a drug and the topcoat is drug-free and non-thrombogenic
boston_scientific admits that wolff contains most of the limitations of claim 8
wolff discloses a metallic_stent with an open_lattice_structure
in figures 2_and_4 where figure 4 is an enlargement of the embodiment shown in figure 2 wolff col.2 ll.53-54 wolff discloses a metallic_stent id.at col.6 ll.57-61 with an open_lattice_structure id.at fig._2

wolff also discloses a stent including an undercoat and a topcoat where the undercoat contains a drug
in figure_3b there is shown a` layer 14' id.at col.9 l.32 made of polymer id.at col.9 l.28 covered by a` second_layer of polymer 15' id.at col.9 l.26
moreover the specification describes that the stent shown in figure_3b` may be made from one or several layers of polymer'
id.at col.9 ll.23-24 emphasis added
thus even though figure_3b shows only two layers of polymer the stent itself and a single coating the specification clearly contemplates the use of several or more than two layers of polymer meaning it contemplates at least two coatings
wolff also discloses that the topcoat is drug-free as layer 15 in figure_3b` may be a simple barrier which limits diffusion of drugs' and` could be as simple as a silicone or polyurethane'
id.at col.9 ll.26-33

wolff also discloses that the topcoat is non-thrombogenic
in figure_3b the` barrier coating 15 could be as simple as a silicone or polyurethane' id.at col.9 ll.32-33 two materials that are generally non-thrombogenic
even if as boston_scientific contends silicone and polyurethane are not inherently non-thrombogenic wolff clearly contemplates that the topcoat will be non-thrombogenic
for example as wolff explains` [ t ] he initial deposition of platelets and subsequent thrombus formation 38 is controlled and minimized by the stent design and the elution which limits platelet aggregation and other immediate *991 repair responses described previously
localized thrombus formations.. [ are ] also decreased'
id.at col.9 ll.46-52 emphases added
in other words wolff contemplates using the design of the stent which may contain a silicone or polyurethane topcoat to reduce thrombogenesis in addition to using the elution of a thrombolytic drug to reduce thrombogenesis
thus the record did not contain substantial_evidence for the jury to conclude that wolff does not teach a non-thrombogenic topcoat

boston_scientific argues that wolff fails to recognize the additional non-thrombogenic benefits of a topcoat that is substantially drug-free over a topcoat that contains drug but wolff need not have recognized the additional benefit of one embodiment to have rendered the claim obvious
see e.g. merck & co. v. biocraft labs. inc. 874_f.2d_804 807 fed.cir.1989` that the [ prior_art ] patent discloses a multitude of effective combinations does not render any particular formulation less obvious
this is especially true because the claimed composition is used for the identical purpose taught by the prior_art
`` ; in re corkill 771_f.2d_1496 1500 fed.cir.1985 affirming obviousness rejection of claims in light of prior_art teaching that` hydrated zeolites will work' in detergent formulations even though` the inventors selected the zeolites of the claims from amongthousands of compounds'

as we have explained wolff teaches all of the limitations of claim 8 and the record did not contain substantial_evidence for the jury to conclude otherwise
the only qualification to this statement of fact is that all of the limitations are found in two separate embodiments pictured side by side in the patent not in one embodiment
however` [ i ] f a person of ordinary_skill can implement a predictable variation ¡± 103 likely bars its patentability'
ksr 127 s.ct.at 1740
we agree with cordis that one of ordinary_skill in the art would have been motivated to combine the embodiment in figure_3b of wolff with the embodiment in figure 4 of wolff to arrive at a metal_stent with two coating_layers
combining two embodiments disclosed adjacent to each other in a prior_art patent does not require a leap of inventiveness
as shown in cordiss drawing and described in the specification of wolff figure depicts a metal_stent with a drug-eluting polymer_coating the coating represented by numeral 14
see wolff col.6 ll.59-62
figure_3b which is located directly below figure 4 in the patent shows a drug-eluting polymer_stent also represented by numeral 14 coated with` a second_layer of polymer 15'
id.at col.9 ll.25-26
one of ordinary_skill would have been motivated to coat the metal_stent of figure 4 including its layer 14 of drug-containing polymer with a second_layer of polymer like layer 15 depicted in figure_3b that is substantially free of an elutable_material
just as the stent in figure_3b benefits from the two layers one containing a drug and the other limiting diffusion of the drug so would the stent in figure 4 benefit from the same two coating_layers
a metal_stent coated with a drug-eluting polymer and a second_layer of drug-free polymer as shown in figures_3b and 4 is what constitutes claim 8

we also agree with cordis that the weak secondary_considerations of nonobviousness do not overcome the strong prima facie showing that wolff renders claim 8 of the ¡¬536_patent obvious
even though medtronic owned the wolff_patent and two other prior_art patents that cordis relies on and failed to develop a drug-eluting_stent cordis presented evidence that the failure was due to difficulty in finding a suitable drug rather than an inability to conceive of a drug-containing undercoat combined with a drug-free_topcoat
moreover *992` given the strength of the prima facie obviousness showing the evidence on secondary_considerations was inadequate to overcome a final conclusion that [ the claim ] would have been obvious'

the district_court thus incorrectly upheld the jurys verdict of nonobviousness
`` where.. the content of the prior_art the scope of the patent claim and the level of ordinary_skill in the art are not in material_dispute and the obviousness of the claim is apparent in light of these factors summary judgment [ or jmol ] is appropriate'

here the content of wolff is not in material_dispute
the experts testimony that wolff` does not teach a metallic_stent having a two-layer_coating' opinion_denying_jmol 434 f.supp.2d at 320 is undisputed ; as we have explained above we agree that wolff does not expressly teach such a stent
however it teaches two embodiments that together render such a stent obvious
the scope of claim 8 of the ¡¬536_patent is not in material_dispute nor is the level of ordinary_skill in the art
although cordis argues that boston_scientific relied on an unduly low level of ordinary_skill the parties agreed at trial to the level of ordinary_skill and did not even present that question to the jury
accordingly we conclude that claim 8 would have been obvious over wolff at the time the invention was made
we are free to override the jurys legal conclusion on the ultimate question of obviousness without deference
see muniauction inc. v. thomson corp. 532_f.3d_1318 1324-28 fed.cir.2008
we therefore hold as a matter of law that claim 8 would have been obvious in view of wolff

because we have reversed the district_courts judgment on validity cordiss arguments regarding infringement and a new_trial need not be considered

conclusion
accordingly the judgment of the district_court is reversed

reversed
