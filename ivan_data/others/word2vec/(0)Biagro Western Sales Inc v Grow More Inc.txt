opinion
plager senior_circuit_judge
in this patent infringement case biagro_western_sales inc.` biagro' and the regents of the university of california` the regents' sued grow more inc.` grow more' in the united_states_district_court for the eastern_district of california
at issue is u.s. patent no._5830,255` the255_patent` which is entitled` formulation of phosphorus fertilizer for plants'
the regents are the assignee and biagro is the exclusive_licensee of the255_patent

on cross-motions for summary_judgment the trial_court held that grow more did not literally infringe the claims of the patent
the trial_court further held that there was no infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
judgment was awarded to grow more
we affirm the judgment of the trial_court

background
the united states patent and trademark office` pto' issued the255_patent on november 3 1998
at the request of the regents to whom the patent had been assigned the pto undertook a reexamination and issued a reexamination certificate on july_11,_2000
as a result of the reexamination all of the independent_claims were amended by adding a limitation originally in several dependent claims relating to the amount of phosphorous-containing acid or salt thereof in the fertilizer_formulation

after reexamination claim 1 representative of the independent_claims of the255_patent read a concentrated_phosphorus_fertilizer comprising a buffered composition comprising at least one phosphorous-containing acid or salt thereof such that when said composition is diluted with water having a ph of about 6.5 at a ratio of about 1 part fertilizer to about 40 parts water there is formed a substantially fully solubilized use-dilution_fertilizer having a foliage-acceptable ph for phosphorus uptake and wherein said phosphorous-containing acid or salt thereof is present in an amount of about 30 to about 40 weight_percent
the emphasized language was added during reexamination to distinguish the claimed invention over prior_art
that added limitation is the focus of the dispute in this case

the term` phosphorous' is an adjectival modifier describing certain compounds containing the element phosphorus p
in the patent the term` phosphorous-containing acid' is used to refer to a group of acids that includes phosphorous_acid h3po3 among other_acids
'255_patent col._3,_ll._56-60
the patent also states that the formulations in the patent are expressed in terms of weight-to-volume instead of weight-to-weight and therefore the term` weight_percent' as used in the claims refers to a weight-to-volume percentage
id.at col._6,_l._67

grow mores accused product is a phosphorus_fertilizer named phos-pro
phos- *1300 pro is made by mixing phosphorous_acid h3po3 with potassium hydroxide koh and water
the reaction results in a solution containing two phosphorous_acid salts-dipotassium monohydrogen phosphite k2hpo3 and potassium dihydrogen phosphite kh2po3 referred to in abbreviated form as dipotassium_phosphite and potassium_phosphite
a third phosphite tripotassium_phosphite k3po3 is present in trace amounts
however and importantly the final phos-pro product does not contain any phosphorous_acid as such

biagro as the exclusive_licensee of the255_patent filed this patent_infringement_suit against grow more in july 2000 shortly after the pto completed reexamination of the patent
grow more filed counterclaims for declaratory judgments of non-infringement and invalidity and for unfair_competition under california state law
the regents were eventually joined as a plaintiff.1

the parties filed cross-motions for summary_judgment on the question of infringement
at issue was the meaning of the added limitation specifying that in the claimed fertilizer composition there was a` phosphorous-containing acid or salt thereof.. present in an amount of about 30 to about 40 weight_percent'
biagro argued that the limitation can be met in an accused product by calculating achemical_equivalent amount of phosphorous-containing acid based on the chemical composition of the fertilizer
in the case of the accused grow more fertilizer that would be the same as the amount of phosphorous-containing acid used in the initial manufacture of the product
grow more argued to the contrary that the limitation referred to the amount of phosphorous-containing acid or salt actually present in the final_fertilizer_product
the trial_court construed the limitation as grow more proposed and since the grow more final_product contained no phosphorous-containing acid held for grow more on that issue

the trial_court concluded further that with regard to the content of acid salts in the fertilizer a fertilizer containing two or more phosphorous-containing salts comes within the literal scope of the claim only if the aggregate_amount of such salts is between about 30 and about 40 weight_percent
based on tests and calculations made by biagros expert the concentration of potassium_phosphite in phos-pro is 40.3 % and the concentration of dipotassium_phosphite is 19.0 %
grow mores calculations indicated the phosphite content to be slightly higher based on a different specific gravity used to convert weight-to-weight_percentages to weight-to-volume_percentages
according to grow mores calculations the weight-to-volume_percentages are 42.2 % for potassium_phosphite and 19.9 % for dipotassium_phosphite
thus the total phosphite concentration in the accused product is between 59.3 % and 62.1 % depending on which partys calculations are used

since the aggregate concentration of the two phosphites in the accused product is at least 59.3 % weight_percent well outside the claimed range and thus not literally infringing the question was whether the amount of salts could be considered infringing under the doctrine of equivalents that is whether 60 +/- % could be considered the equivalent of about 30 to about 40 %
the trial_court chose not to address that question but instead held for grow more on the ground that in light of the amended claims prosecution_history_estoppel acted as a complete_bar to a claim of *1301 infringement under the doctrine of equivalents according to this courts en banc_decision in festo_corp. v. shoketsu_kinzoku_kogyo_kabushiki_co. 234_f.3d_558_(fed.cir.2000) en banc` festo i` the law in effect at the time
the trial_court granted judgment for grow more
biagro_w._sales inc. v. grow more inc. no
cv-f-00-6105 e.d.cal
oct._18,_2001

biagro filed two motions for reconsideration directed to the issue of whether a proper claim_construction should permit use of the chemical_equivalent analysis
the trial_court denied both of these motions for reconsideration
biagro_w._sales inc. v. grow more inc. no
cv-f-00-6105 e.d.cal
aug._15,_2002 ; biagro_w._sales inc. v. grow more inc. no
cv-f-00-6105 e.d.cal
apr._9,_2003

meanwhile the supreme_court vacated and remanded our decision in festo i. festo_corp. v. shoketsu_kinzoku_kogyo_kabushiki_co. 535_u.s._722 122_s.ct._1831 152_l.ed.2d_944_(2002)` festo_ii`
since final_judgment had not yet been entered the trial judge allowed the parties to file briefs addressing whether biagro could rebut the newfesto_presumption that the patentee had surrendered all subject_matter between the original_claim_limitation and the amended claim_limitation
while the trial_court was considering the matter we rendered our second en banc_decision in the festo case this time on remand from the supreme_court festo_corp. v. shoketsu_kinzoku_kogyo_kabushiki_co. 344_f.3d_1359_(fed.cir.2003) en banc` festo_iii`

biagro argued before the trial_court that it could overcome the festo_presumption in two of the ways set forth by the supreme_court in festo_ii and further explained in festo_iii
the trial_court rejected both arguments
biagro_w._sales inc. v. grow more inc. no
cv-f-00-6105 e.d.cal
mar._30,_2004
the trial_court therefore denied biagros motion for reconsideration based on rebuttal of the festo_presumption

the parties stipulated to dismissal without prejudice of grow mores counterclaim for unfair_competition
the trial_court had previously deemed grow mores counterclaim for invalidity withdrawn without prejudice
thus there were no pending unresolved claims and the trial_court entered final_judgment for grow more

biagro filed a timely appeal
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

b
claim construction
on appeal biagro challenges the trial_courts construction of the claim_limitation` wherein said phosphorous-containing acid or salt thereof is present in an amount of about 30 to about 40 weight_percent'
as it did before the trial_court biagro makes two separate arguments each one corresponding to a different theory
we address each theory in turn and we affirm the trial_courts claim_construction under both

1
biagro first argues that the amount of phosphorous-containing acid in the claim_limitation refers to a chemical_equivalent_amount rather than as the trial_court held the amount of phosphorous-containing acid actually present in the final_fertilizer_product
according to biagro thechemical_equivalent is a calculated amount of phosphorous-containing acid regardless of whether phosphorous-containing acid is actually present in the fertilizer that is the amount of phosphorous-containing acid that would react to make the final fertilizer
if the amount of phosphorous-containing acid that was used to create the product is unknown the chemical_equivalent_amount can be derived by testing the final_product and performing a calculation on the results

it is elementary that claim_construction begins with and remains focused on the language of the claims
innova/pure water inc. v. safari water filtration sys. inc. 381_f.3d_1111 1116 fed.cir.2004
as our recent en banc_decision in phillips v. awh corp. reaffirmed the words of a claim are generally given their ordinary and customary_meaning which is the meaning the term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention
415_f.3d_1303 1312-13 fed.cir.2005 en banc citing innova 381 f.3d at 1116
such a person is deemed to read the claim term in the context of the entire patent including the other claims and the written description
id.at 1313
patent claims should also be construed in light of the prosecution_history which like the patent itself has been designated as part of the` intrinsic_evidence'
id.at 1317
extrinsic evidence such as expert testimony may be useful in claim_construction but it should be considered in the context of the intrinsic_evidence
id.at 1318-19

in this case the plain language of the claims gives no indication that the amount of phosphorous-containing acid in the claimed invention is a chemical_equivalent_amount
the claim_language clearly refers to the` amount' of phosphorous-containing acid that is` present' in the` concentrated_phosphorus_fertilizer
`` 2 furthermore the written description contains no discussion at all ofchemical_equivalents or any hint that the amount of phosphorous-containing acid recited in the claims is expressed as a chemical_equivalent_amount instead of the amount actually present in the fertilizer

*1303 as for the prosecution_history of the255_patent biagro relies on only one passage-a statement made by the examiner during reexamination that the phosphite_solution of a prior_art_reference was an example of a phosphorous_acid_solution
at most this shows that a person skilled in the art might refer to a phosphite_solution as a phosphorous_acid_solution when the phosphite_solution like the accused product in this case was formed from phosphorous_acid
but we do not conclude from this one statement that one skilled in the art would interpret claim_language concerning the amount of phosphorous_acid required to be` present' in the fertilizer to mean the amount of phosphorous_acid that was used to make the fertilizer i.e. the chemical_equivalent_amount
the prosecution_history like the patent itself is devoid of the term chemical_equivalent or any reference to the use of representative amounts to describe the composition of the fertilizers claimed in the patent

biagro also cites the prosecution_history of u.s. patent no._6113,665` the665_patent` which is a continuation of the255_patent and was prosecuted during the same timeframe as the reexamination of the255_patent
in remarks accompanying two amendments that added limitations on the amount of phosphorous-containing acid or salt_present in the claimed fertilizer the applicants attorney referred to the amount of phosphorous_acid` in' examples 1_and_9 of the written description
according to biagro these amounts were chemical_equivalent_amounts because the fertilizers produced in those examples do not actually contain phosphorous_acid
as the trial_court noted however there is nothing in the prosecution_history of the665_patent to explain how the figures were obtained or to indicate that the examiner understood the applicant was referring to chemical_equivalent_amounts
whatever the attorneys statements were intended to mean they do not alter the ordinary meaning of the claim_language i.e. that the amount of phosphorous-containing acid is the amount actually present in the fertilizer

in making its arguments biagro relies heavily on extrinsic_evidence in the form of expert declarations explaining fertilizer labeling guidelines and standards
this evidence according to biagro shows that those skilled in the art understand that the amounts of plant nutrients in fertilizer_products are frequently expressed aschemical_equivalents
the primary example is a fertilizer labeling convention known as theguaranteed analysis which indicates the guaranteed amount of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium in the fertilizer product
the phosphorus content is expressed not in its elemental form p but as phosphorus_pentoxide p2o5 regardless of whether the fertilizer actually contains any phosphorus_pentoxide
thus the amount of phosphorus_pentoxide listed on the label is a chemical_equivalent_amount derived from the actual chemical composition of the fertilizer
biagro also cites california fertilizer labeling guidelines that refer to fertilizer_products as` containing' phosphorous_acid when in fact they were only derived from phosphorous_acid
in biagros view this evidence shows that a person skilled in the art would understand the claims to refer to a chemical_equivalent_amount of phosphorous-containing acid and therefore we should accept this interpretation as the ordinary and customary_meaning of the claim_language

however even if we agree that the labeling convention and guidelines demonstrate that those skilled in the art are familiar with the use ofchemical_equivalents the problem is that biagro can not tie its extrinsic_evidence to the patent or the claim_language
nothing in the patent or prosecution_history indicates that labeling *1304 standards are relevant to the claimed fertilizer and nothing in biagros extrinsic_evidence suggests that a person skilled in the art of fertilizer_formulation would necessarily use a chemical_equivalent to express the amount of phosphorous_acid in a fertilizer that does not actually contain phosphorous_acid

we are also unpersuaded by biagros argument that grow mores expert took an inconsistent position on behalf of a different defendant in another patent_infringement_suit brought by biagro
in that case the expert described a prior_art_fertilizer as containing 13 % phosphorous_acid which was ultimately shown to be a chemical_equivalent_amount
we agree with the trial_court that it appears the expert was simply relying on product materials shown to him and was not aware that the 13 % had been arrived at through achemical_equivalent analysis

2
biagros second theory is that the trial_court erred in construing the amount of` phosphorous-containing acid or salt' in the claim_language as an aggregate_amount
the claim_language calls for` at least one phosphorous-containing acid or salt thereof.. wherein said phosphorous-containing acid or salt thereof is present in an amount of about 30 to about 40 weight_percent'
biagro argues that the limitation is met so long as one acid or salt is present in the claimed amount even if the fertilizer contains other_acids or salts
under the trial_courts claim_construction as advocated by grow more a fertilizer containing more than one acid or salt would satisfy the limitation only if the aggregate_amount of acids or salts falls within the claimed range

the phrase` at least one' in patent claims typically is construed to mean` one or more'
therefore biagro contends the claim_language allows for aggregation of acids or salts but does not require it
the trial_court however concluded that both the written description and prosecution_history require the aggregate_amount of acids or salts to be within the claimed range and we agree
first it is apparent from the written description that all phosphorous-containing acids or salts in the fertilizer serve the same purpose such that the total_amount of such_acids or salts is important
more significantly during reexamination the patentee distinguished the invention over prior_art by emphasizing that the claimed fertilizer` must be concentrated` and that the` concentration has now been specified as an amount of about 30 to about 40 weight_percent'
if a fertilizer contains more than one phosphorous-containing acid or salt the concentration is based on the total_amount of such_acids or salts not just one acid or salt
in view of the patentees emphasis on the concentration of phosphorous-containing acids or salts the trial_court correctly construed the claim to require an aggregate_amount of such_acids or salts to be between about 30 and about 40 weight_percent

c. infringement
1
literal infringement
having affirmed the trial_courts claim_construction we also affirm the trial_courts grant of summary_judgment of no literal_infringement with respect to both of the theories presented by biagro
first because we have rejected biagros chemical_equivalent claim_construction argument there can be no literal_infringement based on the amount of phosphorous_acid an ingredient used to make the accused fertilizer but not actually present in the final_product

biagros second literal_infringement theory is that potassium_phosphite is present in the accused product in an amount of 40.3 % which biagro alleges is within the *1305 claimed range of` about 30 to about 40 weight_percent'
the correct claim_construction however requires the aggregate_amount of phosphites to be within the claimed range
because the accused product contains two phosphites resulting in an aggregate phosphite content of at least 59.3 % clearly outside the claimed range no reasonable jury could find literal_infringement based on the presence of phosphites

2
infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
biagro also asserts that grow mores fertilizer infringes the claims of the255_patent under the doctrine of equivalents because the aggregate phosphite concentration of between 59 % and 62 % is equivalent to the claimed concentration of about 30 to about 40 weight_percent
the trial_court did not reach the issue in those terms in its initial summary_judgment order because it held that under festo i prosecution_history_estoppel acted as a complete_bar to a claim of infringement by equivalents
later after the supreme_courts festo_ii decision and this courts festo_iii decision on remand the trial_court reconsidered its summary_judgment ruling but still held that biagro was barred from asserting the doctrine of equivalents because it failed to rebut the festo_presumption

a narrowing amendment made for a substantial reason relating to patentability gives rise to a presumption that the patentee has surrendered all subject_matter between the original_claim_limitation and the amended claim_limitation
festo_iii 344 f.3d at 1367
if the narrowing amendment was the addition of a new claim_limitation as in the case before us equivalents are presumptively not available with respect to that limitation
honeywell int l inc. v. hamilton sundstrand corp. 370_f.3d_1131 1141 fed.cir.2004

a patentee may rebut the presumption of surrender by showing that at the time of the amendment one skilled in the art could not reasonably be expected to have drafted a claim that would have literally encompassed the alleged equivalent
festo_ii 535 u.s. at 741 122_s.ct._1831
the supreme_court identified three ways in which the patentee may overcome the presumption
the patentee may show that the alleged equivalent would have been unforeseeable at the time of the amendment that the rationale underlying the amendment bore no more than a tangential relation to the equivalent in question or that there was` some other_reason' that the patentee could not reasonably have been expected to have described the alleged equivalent
id.at 740-41 122_s.ct._1831

as an initial matter we reject biagros argument that at the summary_judgment stage the burden is on grow more to present undisputed facts showing that biagro can not rebut the festo_presumption
the supreme_court made clear that the patentee bears the burden of rebutting the presumption of surrender
id.at 740 122_s.ct._1831
furthermore the determination of whether the presumption has been rebutted is a question of law
festo_iii 344 f.3d at 1368
although in some situations there may be underlying factual_issues id.at 1368_n._3 neither of biagros rebuttal arguments involves disputed facts as will be explained below

we begin by examining the amendment that was made to the claims of the255_patent
during reexamination the patentee made a narrowing amendment to all of the independent_claims by adding the claim_limitation` wherein said phosphorous-containing acid or salt thereof *1306 is present in an amount of about 30 to about 40 weight_percent'
the amendment was made to overcome a prior_art obviousness rejection based on a reference describing a fertilizer that was buffered only when diluted
to distinguish the claims over the prior_art_reference the patentee explained to the examiner that the fertilizer must be concentrated and that the amendment specified a range for the concentration
therefore the narrowing amendment was made for a reason substantially related to patentability and biagro has presumptively surrendered any equivalents with respect to the amount of phosphorous-containing acid or salt_present in the fertilizer

biagro first attempts to rebut the presumption of surrender by arguing that the rationale underlying the amendment was no more than tangentially related to the asserted equivalent
as we explained in festo_iii whether the patentee has overcome the presumption on this ground is determined by the court on the basis of the public record
id.at 1369-70
in this case it is clear from the prosecution_history that the reason for adding the range limitation was to overcome a prior_art_fertilizer that was not concentrated

here the alleged equivalent is a fertilizer with a phosphite concentration of nearly 60 %
because both the reason for the amendment and the asserted equivalent relate to the concentration of the fertilizer we affirm the trial_courts conclusion that biagro has not shown that the rationale underlying the amendment was merely tangential to the accused equivalent

we disagree with biagro that this case is analogous to insituform technologies inc. v. cat contracting inc. 385_f.3d_1360_(fed.cir.2004)
that case involved a method for impregnating a tube_liner with a resin by moving a single vacuum cup to multiple points along the tube_liner
the accused process used multiple vacuum_cups and the patentee asserted that the multiple-cup_process was equivalent to the single-cup_process
the original claim did not specify the number or location of vacuum_cups
during prosecution the patentee incorporated several limitations from dependent claims into independent claim 1
the prosecution_history showed that the reason for the amendment was to overcome a prior_art process that used a single vacuum source at the end of the tube_liner distant from the resin source
thus the reason for the amendment and the alleged equivalent involved different aspects of the invention-the location of the vacuum source relative to the resin versus the number of vacuum_cups
id.at 1370
accordingly we concluded that the rationale underlying the amendment was tangential to the allegedly equivalent process
in contrast the reason for the amendment and the accused equivalent in the case before us both relate to the concentration of the fertilizer

biagro also argues that because only the lower limit of the claimed range was necessary to distinguish over prior_art the reason for the amendment is merely tangential to an accused equivalent at the upper end of the range
in effect biagro is arguing that there was no reason for adding an upper_limit of 40 %
viewed from that perspective the situation is analogous to the amendment in festo that added the` magnetizable' limitation
the prosecution_history revealed no reason for the amendment and therefore festo could not show that the rationale underlying the amendment was only tangential to the accused nonmagnetizable equivalent
festo_iii 344 f.3d at 1371-72
similarly in this case since the prosecution_history shows no reason for adding an upper_limit to the concentration range biagro can not claim that the rationale for the amendment is merely tangential

*1307 biagro further argues that it can rebut the festo_presumption of surrender with` some other_reason' that the patentee could not reasonably have been expected to have described the alleged equivalent when it narrowed the claim
that` other' reason is that the patentee allegedly understood the claim_language to refer to a chemical_equivalent_amount of phosphorous_acid
we agree with the trial_court that biagros contention should be rejected as merely an attempt to reargue the claim_construction issue
moreover we fail to see how the patentees supposed inability to draft claims to cover chemical_equivalent_amounts relates to biagros equivalence argument which is that the approximately 60 %_concentration of phosphite actually present in the accused product is equivalent to the claimed 30-40 %_concentration

for the reasons discussed we affirm the trial_courts holding that biagro has not rebutted the presumption of surrender and that prosecution_history_estoppel bars biagro from asserting infringement under the doctrine of equivalents

conclusion
the judgment of the trial_court is in all respects

affirmed
