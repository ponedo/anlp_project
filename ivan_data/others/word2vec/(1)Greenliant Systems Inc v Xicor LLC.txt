background
under 35 u.s.c.¡± 251 a patentee may within two years of the issuance of a patent seek a broadening reissue of that patent if among other_things the patentee originally claimed` less than he had a right to claim'
see mbo labs. inc. v. becton dickinson & co. 602_f.3d_1306 1313 fed.cir.2010
however under the rule against recapture` a patentee is precluded from regaining the subject_matter that he surrendered in an effort to obtain allowance of the original_claims'
n._am container inc. v. plastipak packaging inc. 415_f.3d_1335 1349 fed.cir.2005 internal_quotation_marks omitted
this case presents the question of whether broadening claims 12_and_13 of the reissued rebig_token__¡¬370_patent__big_token the claims at issue in this case improperly recaptured claim scope *1264 that xicor1 had previously surrendered during the prosecution of its predecessor u.s._patent_no._5977,585` the ¡¬585_patent`

i
the specifications of the ¡¬585_patent and the rebig_token__¡¬370_patent__big_token are substantially identical and disclose improvements to electronic_memory_devices specifically eeprom circuits in which` the presence or absence of charge on a floating gate electrode indicates a binary one or zero'
rebig_token__¡¬370_patent__big_token col. 1_ll._20 -22 ; ¡¬585_patent_col. 1_ll._16 -18
in an eeprom charge is transferred to and from the floating gate electrode through a tunneling_oxide_layer that acts as an insulator when not actively tunneling
however traditional tunneling_oxide_layers formed by thermal oxide growth are susceptible to pin-hole defects as well as compressive stress
the improved tunneling_oxide_layer disclosed in the patents reduces defects and stress and thereby improves among other_things processing_yields reliability and the useful life of eeprom memory

claim 1 of the ¡¬585_patent recited 1
an improved tunneling region for use with an integrated circuit comprising a first_layer of polysilicon ; a first electron_tunneling_layer of thermal oxide formed over said first_layer of polysilicon ; a second electron_tunneling_layer of annealed deposited silicon dioxide formed over said first tunneling_layer having a thickness less than 2000 angstroms thick said silicon_dioxide_layer being formed by low_pressure_chemical_vapor_deposition comprising the use of tetraethylorthosilicate ; and
a second_layer of polysilicon formed over said layer of deposited silicon dioxide such that when a bias voltage is applied between said first_layer of polysilicon and said second_layer of polysilicon electron_tunneling will occur from said first_layer of polysilicon to said second_layer of polysilicon through said first and second electron_tunneling_layers
¡¬585_patent_col. 4_l._66 -col. 5_l._17_(emphasis_added)
claim 4 the only other independent claim of the ¡¬585_patent recited 4
a semiconductor device including means for electron_tunneling comprising a first_conductive_layer ; an annealed silicon dioxide tunneling_layer having a thickness less than 2000 angstroms formed on top of said conductive layer said silicon_dioxide_layer being formed by low_pressure_chemical_vapor_deposition comprising the use of tetraethylorthosilicate ; a second_conductive_layer formed on top of said silicon_dioxide_layer said first_conductive_layer acting as a source of tunneling_electrons under an appropriate voltage bias condition said second_conductive_layer serving as the receptor of said tunneling_electrons
¡¬585_patent_col. 5_l._25 -col. 6_l._8_(emphasis_added)
for the purposes of this case the two key limits of the disputed` tunneling_layer' in both claim 1 and claim 4 of the ¡¬585_patent are that 1 the layer is` formed by low_pressure_chemical_vapor_deposition' and 2 the deposition` compris [ es ] the use of tetraethylorthosilicate' which is also referred to as` teos'
both of these claims are product-by-process *1265 claims i.e. the product is defined in part by the process by which it is made

ii
the ¡¬585_patent and the rebig_token__¡¬370_patent__big_token relate back to u.s. patent application no._07 /195,766` the ¡¬766_application' filed on may_17,_1988
claims 1-12 of the originally filed ¡¬766_application covered methods for depositing an electron_tunneling_layer while claim 13 covered a device containing such a deposited tunneling_layer
on january 19 1989 the examiner issued a restriction_requirement under 35 u.s.c.¡± 121 that required xicor to separately prosecute the method_claims and the device claim
xicor elected to first prosecute the method_claims after the restriction_requirement became final on august 3 1989

during prosecution of the method_claims the examiner rejected among others claim 7 as being obvious in view of prior_art` disclos [ ing ] that the tunneling_oxide_layer can be.. deposited by [ low_pressure_chemical_vapor_deposition ]'
j.a
453
however the examiner stated that` [ i ] f claim 7 was amended to recite that the tunneling_oxide_layer was deposited by [ low_pressure_chemical_vapor_deposition ] using teos the claim would be allowable'
j.a
454 emphasis added
xicor added the teos_limit and claim 7 was subsequently allowed as part of u.s._patent_no._5219,774` the ¡¬774_patent` which issued on june_15,_1993

on may_18,_1993 while the application for the ¡¬774_patent was still pending xicor filed a divisional_application which copied independent claim 13 the lone device claim from the original ¡¬766_application and added among others independent device claim 14
claims 13_and_14 of the divisional_application eventually issued as claims 1_and_4 of the ¡¬585_patent and are thus critical to the recapture_rule issue presented in this case

on july_28,_1993 the examiner rejected claims_13_and_14 among others as obvious
in response xicor amended claim 13 to include the` said silicon_dioxide_layer being formed by low_pressure_chemical_vapor_deposition comprising the use of [ teos ]' limit that was already included in claim 14 as initially drafted in the divisional_application
j.a
610

on march_25,_1994 the examiner again rejected claims_13_and_14 on anticipation and obviousness grounds
as described below the process_limitations in product-by-process_claims such as claims_13_and_14 can not be used to distinguish prior_art unless the process imparts structural_differences to the product
the examiner explained that the process_limitations of the device_claims i.e. how the tunneling_layer is` formed by a low_pressure_chemical_vapor_deposition comprising the use of [ teos ]' would not be given` patentable_weight over.. the prior_art of record' unless xicor established that those process limits imparted` structural_limitations' that distinguished the claimed device from prior_art_devices
j.a
621-23
as described in greater detail below xicor argued in response that` deposited teos_oxide` did in fact have` significant_structural_benefits over prior_art_thermal_oxide_layers when used as tunneling_layers'
j.a
632 first emphasis added
unpersuaded the examiner maintained the rejections
however the board of patent appeals and interferences` board' reversed the examiners rejections finding that the` advantages of teos deposited oxides versus thermally grown oxides' were` sufficient to establish unobvious_differences between' the claims and the prior_art

the ¡¬585_patent issued on november 2 1999 with claims_13_and_14 of the divisional_application issuing as claims 1_and_4 of the ¡¬585_patent

*1266 on november 2 2001 xicor filed a reissue application for the ¡¬ 585 patent
xicor added new_claims 12_and_13 which omitted the` comprising the use of [ teos ]' limit but otherwise duplicated claims 1_and_4 of the ¡¬ 585 patent
the reissue examiner found that claims 12_and_13 did not include and were` not broader than the surrendered subject_matter' and thus were` not barred by the recapture_rule'

on february 11 2011 greenliant filed an action against xicor seeking a declaration that it did not infringe any claims of the rebig_token__¡¬370_patent__big_token and that all claims of the rebig_token__¡¬370_patent__big_token are invalid
the parties agreed that a summary_judgment_order in sst 776 f.supp.2d at 1086 determining that claims 12_and_13 of the re¡¬370 were invalid under the recapture_rule` applies equally in this case and should be entered herein'
see greenliant no._11-_cv-0631 slip op.at 2-3
based on the prosecution_history of the ¡¬585_patent the district_court in the sst_case had reasoned that
[ a ] reasonable objective_observer would conclude that the teos_limitation was included in order to distinguish the claimed.. process_limitations [ in the product-by-process_claims ] from the prior_art
by including the teos_limitation xicor surrendered alternative chemicals to teos and these alternatives were recaptured by claims 12_and_13 of the ¡¬370 reissue patent
sst 776 f.supp.2d at 1086.2

along with the stipulation regarding claims 12_and_13 the parties agreed that greenliants` claims for declaratory_judgment relief of noninfringement and invalidity that relate to claims 1-11 of the [ re ] ¡¬370_patent` should be dismissed based on a covenant not to sue
with no issues remaining the district_court entered a final_judgment in favor of greenliant on june_22,_2011 holding claims 12_and_13 invalid and dismissing the request for declaratory relief as to claims 1-11
at that time the district_court also granted ssts motion to intervene in the greenliant case allowing sst to participate in an anticipated appeal to this court
on august 1 2011 the district_court granted xicors motion to clarify the record
the district_court clarified that its judgment was` based on the legal and factual findings contained in the.. march_21,_2011 [ sst_order ]' and ordered that` the materials on which the [ sst_order ] [ wa ] s based' including the prosecution_history of the ¡¬585_patent` be made part of this record'

edwards lifesciences llc v. cook inc. 582_f.3d_1322 1335 fed.cir.2009
regardless of the standard applied by the district_court we apply the correct clear and convincing evidence standard on appeal and agree with the district_courts result

as noted above the reissue statute provides that` a patentee may surrender a patent and seek reissueenlarging the scope of the [ original_patents ] claims ifthrough error without any deceptive intent he claimedless than he had a right to claim in the [ original ] patent and he applies for reissuewithin two years from the grant of the original_patent
`` mbo labs. 602 f.3d at 1313 quoting 35 u.s.c.¡± 251
under the rule against recapture a patentees reissue_claims are invalid when those claims were broadened to include subject_matter that the patentee previously surrendered during prosecution of the original_patent
id
thus` a patentee is precludedfrom regaining the subject_matter that he surrendered in an effort to obtain allowance of the original_claims

an assessment of a challenge under the recapture_rule is guided by three steps 1 first we determine whether and in what respect the reissue_claims are broader in scope than the original_patent claims ; 2 next we determine whether the broader aspects of the reissue_claims relate to subject_matter surrendered in the original prosecution ; and 3 finally we determine whether the reissue_claims were materially narrowed in other respects so that the claims may not have been enlarged and hence avoid the recapture_rule

here aside from the removal of the teos_limit claims 12_and_13 of the rebig_token__¡¬370_patent__big_token are identical to claims 1_and_4 of the ¡¬585_patent
the parties agree that claims 12_and_13 of the rebig_token__¡¬370_patent__big_token are broader than claims 1_and_4 of the ¡¬585_patent as a result of the removal of the teos_limit
the parties also agree that the second step is the only step at issue namely whether there was a surrender of subject_matter

to decide whether a patentee surrendered certain subject_matter we must determine` whether an objective_observer viewing the prosecution_history would conclude that the purpose of the patentees amendment or argument' concerning a particular claim was for reasons of patentability that is` to overcome prior_art and secure the patent'
kim v. conagra_foods inc. 465_f.3d_1312 1323 fed.cir.2006
in order to surrender subject_matter through argument as opposed to claim amendment a patentee` must clearly and unmistakably argue that his invention does not cover [ that ] subject_matter to overcome an examiners rejection based on prior_art'
mbo labs. 602 f.3d at 1314

the parties dispute whether the prosecution_history of the method_claims in the ¡¬774_patent is relevant to whether xicor in the course of the prosecution of the device_claims surrendered devices produced through the use of non-teos reactants
we do not need to reach this question because we find that xicor surrendered the relevant subject_matter based on the prosecution_history of the ¡¬585_patent alone

as noted earlier claims 1_and_4 of the ¡¬585_patent were written in product-by-process form whereby the disputed tunneling *1268 layer element in each claim was` defined at least in part in terms of the method or process by which it [ was ] made'

`` that is because of the.. long-standing rule that an old product is not patentable even if it is made by a new process'
id.at 1370 ; see also smithkline beecham corp. v. apotex corp. 439_f.3d_1312 1317 fed.cir.2006` it has long been established that one can not avoid anticipation by an earlier product disclosure by claiming.. the product as produced by a particular process
`` ; thorpe 777 f.2d at 697` if the product in a product-by-process_claim is the same as or obvious from a product of the prior_art the claim is unpatentable even though the prior product was made by a different process`
however there is an exception to this general rule that the process by which the product is made is irrelevant
as we recognized in amgen if the process by which a product is made imparts` structural and functional differences' distinguishing the claimed product from the prior_art then those differences` are relevant as evidence of no anticipation' although they` are not explicitly part of the claim'
580 f.3d at 1370 ; see also smithkline 439 f.3d at 1319` if those product-by-process_claims produced a different product than that disclosed by the [ prior_art ] there would be an argument that the [ prior_art ] did not anticipate
`` ; in re garnero 56_ccpa_1289 412_f.2d_276 279 1969 finding that certain process limits are` capable of construction as structural.. limitations'

consistent with our precedent the patent_office in determining patentability considers the process in which a product is formed if that process imparts distinctive_structural_characteristics the structure implied by the process_steps should be considered when assessing the patentability of product-by-process_claims over the prior_art especially where the product can only be defined by the process_steps by which the product is made or where the manufacturing process_steps would be expected to impart distinctive_structural_characteristics to the final_product

xicor points out that it` could only have surrendered non-teos reactants by making arguments or amendments whose purposewas to overcome prior_art and secure the patent
`` appellants br
28 quoting mbo labs. 602 f.3d at 1314
xicor also points out that` the teos process limitation must have imparted novel physical_characteristics to the device in order for it to distinguish prior_art'
appellants br
29
however xicor argues` [ the teos ] process limitation did not [ actually ] impart any distinctive_structural_characteristics to the claimed device'
appellants br
30
instead xicor asserts it was the deposition_conditions such as temperature and pressure rather than the choice of chemical reactants that determined the physical_characteristics of the claimed devices tunneling_layer
thus according to xicor it did not surrender devices produced through the use of non-teos reactants
we disagree

*1269 during the prosecution of the ¡¬585_patent xicor both amended claim 13 to add the teos_limit and relied on the teos_limit appearing in claims_13_and_14 to overcome prior_art
xicor submitted a fact declaration and repeatedly used that declaration to argue before the examiner and more importantly before the board that forming the claimed tunneling_layer by a low_pressure_chemical_vapor_deposition with teos imparted structural_differences that distinguished the claimed tunneling_layer from the prior_art

in a march_25,_1994 office action the examiner rejected claims_13_and_14 of the divisional_application on multiple grounds
the examiner first rejected claims_13_and_14 as anticipated by hazani
the examiner noted that` hazani shows a [ ] [ memory ] device having first and second polycrystalline silicon layers' and a` 650 angstrom oxide layer' through which` [ o ] ne can define a plane.. to define atunnelling layer andthermal layer
`` j.a
621
the examiner also rejected claims_13_and_14 as obvious over sato in view of korma
the examiner found that sato described a` tunnelling silicon_dioxide_layer [ ] disposed between two polycrystalline silicon layers' and korma disclosed an oxide_thickness of 1000 angstroms making it obvious to use an oxide_thickness under 2000 angstroms as recited in claims_13_and_14
j.a
622

in conjunction with both of these rejections the examiner explained that the process_limitations in the product-by-process_claims i.e. the tunneling_layer being` formed by a low_pressure_chemical_vapor_deposition comprising the use of [ teos ]' were` not given patentable_weight over.. the prior_art'
j.a
621
[ t ] he applicant is reminded that it is the patentability of the final_product per se which must be determined in a` product by process' claim and not the patentability of the process and that as here an old or obvious product produced by a new method is not patentable as a product whether claimed in` product by process' claims or not
[ see thorpe 777_f.2d_695 ]
the claims do not contain any structural_limitations between the two oxide_layers to make them distinguishable from one another i.e. different molecular density concentrations or molecular ordering
therefore although grown by different processes the silicon_dioxide_layers claimed are not distinguishable from satos
j.a
622
the examiner also explained the applicant must show the structural_limitations caused from the process of making the device
the matter given weight in claims drawn to structure having` process of making' segments are those present in the final_product and here after forming one oxide layer on another one can not distinguish separate tunnelling and thermal oxide_layers in the final_product
j.a
623-24

on august 29 1994 xicors response to the examiners rejection was received by the patent_office
xicor made no further amendments to claim 13_or_14 which by this time both included the teos_limit
however xicor argued that its claimed invention including a` deposited teos_oxide layer' was` structurally distinct from the prior_art_thermal_oxide_layers taught by hazani and sato'
j.a
628

xicor pointed to` characteristics of the claimed device [ that ] are clearly different and superior to the prior_art_thermal_oxide_layers' and thus in xicors view evidenced structural_differences between the prior_art and the claimed teos deposited tunneling_oxide_layer
j.a
631
with respect to improved dielectric_properties xicor argued [ the inventor ] found that low temperature deposited dielectrics properly annealed *1270 are better than thermal oxides for tunneling
for example.. the inventor discovered that teos_tunneling_oxides formed in the manner claimed in this case increase the total_charge which can be conducted through a dielectric_layer by at least an order of magnitude while at the same_time providing a dramatic_improvement in processing_yields
j.a
629
further with respect to stress xicor argued it is well known that thermally grown oxide_layers create heavy compressive stress
it is well known that teos deposited layer can be defined to induce either compressive or tensile stress and be of a much lower magnitude than for thermally grown oxide
consequently stress can be minimized when using a teos deposited tunneling_oxide_layer
this provides the advantage of a device having a much greater useful life
j.a
630 internal_quotation_marks omitted
finally with respect to pinhole defects xicor argued [ p ] inholes are often created in a thermal oxide layer as a result of small metallic impurities in the underlying silicon or polysilicon layer
the teos deposited layer coats all surfaces and thus will fill in such pinholes.. j.a
630 internal_quotation_marks omitted
due to these improved characteristics xicor asserted` the industry has acknowledged that the use of deposited teos_oxide has significant_structural_benefits over prior_art_thermal_oxide_layers when used as tunneling_layers'
j.a
632

on november 15 1994 the examiner again rejected claims_13_and_14 among others as being anticipated by hazani and in the alternative as obvious over sato in view of korma
xicor subsequently appealed to the board
before the board xicor urged that the` prior_art_devices.. d [ id ] not possess the characteristics and structure of appellants claimed device' j.a
656 and repeated the arguments that it had made to the examiner regarding the improved dielectric_properties reduced stress and reduced defect densities of the claimed teos deposited tunneling_oxide_layer
j.a
657-61
with respect to the anticipation and obvious rejections xicor argued the structure of the tunneling_oxide_layer according to the present invention is significantly different from prior_art tunneling_oxide_layers since the inventive layer substantially reduces stress and defect density
forming teos_tunneling_oxides in the manner claimed by [ xicor ] increases the total_charge which can be conducted through a dielectric_layer by at least an order of magnitude while at the same_time providing a dramatic_improvement in processing_yields
the examiner has not shown that the cited references alone or in combination suggest or teach this process or its advantages
j.a
661 emphasis added
moreover in order to distinguish a prior_art reference that found another type of deposition preferable to teos deposition for forming an insulation layer xicor specifically argued that` one skilled in the art would not have been motivated to use teos for oxide deposition'
j.a
663

on june_3,_1999 the board reversed the examiners rejections of claims_13_and_14 among others
the board understood xicors arguments to be directed to the teos_limit noting that` [ t ] he only issue on appeal is the weight to be given to the process step ofsaid silicon_dioxide_layer being formed by low_pressure_chemical_vapor_deposition comprising the use of [ teos ]
`` j.a
726-27
the board held the foregoing advantages of teos deposited oxides versus thermally grown oxides.. are sufficient to establish *1271 unobvious_differences between the claimed product and the prior_art
j.a
731-32 emphasis added

xicors arguments clearly and unmistakably represented to the examiner and the board that teos was a necessary component of the deposition process that imparted the distinct structural characteristics upon xicors claimed tunneling_oxide_layer
there is no merit to xicors argument that these multiple references to the use of teos can be dismissed as mere` nomenclature.. used by xicor as a label to distinguish' between different tunneling_layers
appellants br
60
it is clear that` an objective_observer viewing the prosecution_history would conclude' that xicor had surrendered devices produced through the use of non-teos reactants during the prosecution of the ¡¬585_patent to overcome prior_art and secure the patent
kim 465 f.3d at 1323
under the rule against recapture xicor can not now reclaim that surrendered subject_matter
pannu 258 f.3d at 1370-71

xicor argues that as a technical matter` it is the deposition_conditions-such as temperature and pressure-that determine the physical_characteristics' of the claimed tunneling_oxide_layer not the reactant such as teos that is used
appellants br
54
thus according to xicor the teos_limit could not have influenced the boards decision to allow the claims
but xicor is bound by the arguments that it made before the examiner and before the board
it does not matter whether the examiner or the board adopted a certain argument for allowance ; the sole question is whether the argument was made
see e.g. springs window fashions lp v. novo indus. l.p. 323_f.3d_989 995 fed.cir.2003 holding that though` it is not clear from the record why the examiner allowed the claims' the examiners reasons for allowance` do not negate the effect of the applicants disclaimer'
nor does it matter here whether teos actually imparted the cited structural_differences because xicor argued that it did

this principle is well established by our cases on prosecution_history disclaimer a doctrine that` serves the same policy' as the recapture_rule i.e.` prevent [ ing ] a patentee from encroaching back into territory that had previously been committed to the public'
mbo labs. 602 f.3d at 1318 internal_quotation_marks omitted ; see also hester indus. inc. v. stein inc. 142_f.3d_1472 1482 fed.cir.1998
in north american container for example the patentee distinguished the` generally convex' inner_walls of his invention from prior_art that as the patentee characterized it contained` wall portions 3 [ that ] are slightly concave'
415 f.3d at 1343 emphasis added
thus we held that` generally convex' not only required that the majority of points along the claimed walls were convex but also that no portions along the claimed walls were concave
id.at 1345-46
the patentee argued that during prosecution he` intended only to distinguish his invention from the prior_art on the basis that the inner_walls in the prior_art bottles [ we ] re entirely concave'
id
but regardless of any technical merit behind the newly explained distinction we held that the patentee was bound by arguments actually made during prosecution

`` although the inner_walls disclosed in the [ prior_art ] patents may be viewed as entirely concave that is not what the applicant argued during prosecution to gain allowance for his claims'
id

here xicor is bound by the arguments it made during the prosecution of the ¡¬ 585 patent which clearly establish that it surrendered devices produced through the use of non-teos reactants for the recited low_pressure_chemical_vapor_deposition in *1272 order to gain allowance
thus we affirm the district_courts holding that claims 12_and_13 of the rebig_token__¡¬370_patent__big_token are invalid under the rule against recapture

affirmed

the re¡¬370 was originally assigned to xicor corp. the predecessor of the current owner xicor_llc
for simplicity we will refer to these entities collectively as` xicor'

the district_court in sst also found that the prosecution_history of the process_claims of the ¡¬774_patent established an independent basis for holding that xicor had surrendered non-teos reactants prior to recapturing those alternatives by claims 12_and_13 of the re¡¬ 370 patent
see 776 f.supp.2d at 1085-86
in light of our disposition we need not reach this issue

appellees argue that we should dismiss this case because in their view xicors only basis for appeal is the summary_judgment_order in the sst_case and there has been no final_judgment in that case
however this is not a situation in which the parties stipulated that the final_result of another action be the final_result here
rather the parties merely agreed that a specific order in the sst_case be applied and entered in this case
appellees arguments are without merit
