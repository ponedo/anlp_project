background
bayer is a large pharmaceutical company that produces the daily oral_contraceptive yasminthe_r
one of the active_ingredients in yasmin drospirenone is a progestin that inhibits ovulation
each of the invalidated claims requires drospirenone as the active ingredient
drospirenone was known in the art at all times relevant
its contraceptive qualities are particularly well suited for producing an oral_contraceptive because in addition to inhibiting ovulation it is a diuretic which will diminish excess water retention arising from the estrogen component of oral_contraceptives and has anti-acne qualities to promote clear skin
these desirable qualities have led to yasmins success
drospirenone is also acid-sensitive
when exposed to low-ph highly acidic environments such as found in the human_stomach drospirenone` isomerizes' -that is the acid catalyzes a reaction that rearranges drospirenones molecular structure while its molecular composition remains constant
the resulting isomer is non-antimineralocorticoidal meaning it will not act as a diuretic removing the desirable anti-bloating effect that sets drospirenone apart from other prior_art progestins
therefore scientists working with drospirenone for use in an oral_contraceptive must be aware of and work around the effects that the human_stomach will have on the drug to ensure that its` bioavailability' -the amount of the active drug absorbed into the bloodstream and available to act on the body-is high enough to perform its contraceptive function

drospirenone is also a poorly water soluble hydrophobic composition
because it will not easily dissolve into a volume of liquid its bioavailability is degraded
to combat this pharmaceutical producers commonly employ a technique called` micronization' whereby the drugs particle size is reduced increasing its overall surface area
often but not always with a larger surface area the dissolution_rate is also increased ensuring that all of the poorly water soluble drug that can dissolve *1344 will dissolve in a given volume of liquid
with more of the drug dissolved the drug will exhibit a higher bioavailability
indeed bayers expert testified at trial that this would be his first choice in attempting to increase the dissolution_rate because among the different ways to increase the dissolution_rate micronization presents the best_chance of success
all commercially available oral_contraceptives use micronized progestins and/or estrogens so this technique was well known in the art

while micronizing a poorly water soluble composition may result in increased bioavailability micronizing an acid-sensitive composition may also increase its sensitivity to the acid
a drug that isomerizes when exposed to acid thus may isomerize at a faster rate if it is micronized

one method pharmaceutical companies use to surmount an acid-sensitivity problem with a drug to be taken orally is to deliver the drug via an enteric-coated_pill as opposed to an immediate release pill also called a` normal_pill'
an enteric_coating is a ph-sensitive film that protects the drug from stomach_acid and only releases the drug when it has passed into the less acidic duodenum and small intestine
however enteric_coatings are not without drawbacks themselves
coated tablets including enteric_coated_tablets present an obstacle to absorption and thus reduce the drugs exhibited bioavailability
additionally as was known in the art at the time they introduce a significant delay in the onset of therapeutic response while creating a considerable patient-to-patient variation of that onset
in fact even for an individual taking the drug at different times the response time may vary considerably from dose to dose
bayer_scientists noticed these intra-and inter-individual bioavailability differences in practice in their studies on beagles and women
this presented a further complication because bayer required the drug to be 99 % effective and work on all women at a single dose-' one dose must fit all'
a normal_pill may not present such variations but will expose its contents to the stomachs highly acidic_environment

dr. johannes tack a bayer scientist began work in 1983 to develop drospirenone into an oral_contraceptive
at the time bayer had been working with a related compound spirorenone as a diuretic
when consumed spirorenone metabolizes into drospirenone which is still a diuretic but was found to have progestogenic contraceptive effects
spirorenone itself had some contraceptive effects that bayer concluded were the result of the appearance of drospirenone when it metabolized
bayer decided to harness the diuretic effect of isolated drospirenone to create the new contraceptive
tack consulted prior bayer work with drospirenone including in vitro isomerization studies performed by a fellow bayer scientist dr. werner krause
krause had also performed in vivo_studies with spirorenone about which he published three articles
these studies krause_i ii and iii included the knowledge that drospirenone was a metabolite of spirorenone
tack decided however that these in vivo_studies garnered little information on the practice of drospirenone in vivo

tack tested the stability of drospirenone in acid at ph 1 to simulate the conditions of the stomach
he found that after 10 minutes 21 % of the drospirenone had isomerized in the acid and after 45 minutes half had isomerized
he came to a critical conclusion if the results obtained in vitro are applied to in vivo conditions it can be presumed that with an assumed gastric *1345 juice volume of 100ml the majority of the dose solubility of drospirenone 5-10 mg/l passes into solution during passage through the stomach and consequently undergoes rapid isomerization
a clear reduction in the bioavailability of the unchanged active substance is to be expected as a result
the planned studies on the progestogenic efficacy of [ drospirenone ] should therefore be performed with an enteric-coated formulation
tack then moved into clinical studies with an enteric-coated formulation of drospirenone
for five years bayer used this coated_pill in its studies even reconfirming in 1988 that drospirenone needed an enteric_coating because it isomerized quickly in a ph 1 acidic solution

in 1988 bayer also planned a study to determine how effectively its enteric-coated_tablet delivered a formulation as compared to an intravenous_injection of the same formulation
this study would thus measure the` absolute bioavailability' of the drug
bayer added what it terms a` non-routine' element to the study by which it added an unprotected normal drospirenone tablet and compared its bioavailability to that of the enteric-coated formulation and the intravenous delivery
tack expected to find that the enteric-coated_tablet would produce a lower_bioavailability than an intravenous_injection while the normal_pill would produce an even lower_bioavailability than the enteric-coated_tablet
however he found that despite his observations that drospirenone would quickly isomerize in a highly acidic_environment and his belief therefore that an enteric_coating would be necessary to preserve bioavailability the normal_pill and the enteric-coated_pill resulted in the same bioavailability
following this study bayer developed drospirenone in a normal_pill for which it would eventually receive the ¡¬531_patent

bayer relied on the finding that drospirenone would absorb with a normal_pill to overcome an obviousness rejection in the patent and trademark office
during prosecution the examiner rejected the claims as obvious in view of a de castro reference which the examiner said taught to micronize poorly soluble_drugs to increase their bioavailability
bayer responded that another piece of prior_art the nickisch_reference taught that micronizing drospirenone would increase its exposure to the highly acidic_environment in the stomach which would result in increased isomerization
the examiner allowed the claims giving the specific reason that the prior_art suggested that micronizing drospirenone would not work` the micronized_drospirenone will be degraded even more rapidly because the micronization of drospirenone expose [ sic ] the drug particles in the stomach acidic
therefore to formulate an oral dosage forms [ sic ] containing the drospirenone particles which exposed to the gastric_environment upon dissolution would be un [ o ] bvious in view of the data presented..'

the ¡¬531_patent issued on september 7 2004
claim 1 is representative 1
a pharmaceutical composition comprising
from about 2 mg to about 4 mg of micronized_drospirenone particles about 0.01 mg to about 0.05 mg of 17.alpha.-ethinylestradiol and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers the composition being in an oral dose form exposed to the gastric_environment upon dissolution *1346 and the composition being effective for oral contraception in a human female

barr_laboratories` barr' makes generic pharmaceuticals and filed an abbreviated new drug application with the food and drug administration seeking approval to market a generic version of yasminthe_r
bayer promptly filed a patent infringement suit against barr
the parties agreed that if the ¡¬531_patent is valid barr infringes claims 1 5 8 27 29 36 49 and 50
barr then alleged that these claims are obvious among other invalidity and unenforceability arguments
at trial the two parties agreed that 2-4 mg drospirenone was well known in the art as well as its combination with 0.01-0.big_token__05_mg_17__big_token a-ethinylestradiol a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a kit containing 21 such tablets with active_ingredients and 7 placebos to be used as an effective oral_contraceptive in human females
bayer claimed that its innovation was that the drospirenone could be micronized to increase its bioavailability and that the micronized_drospirenone would not need to be enteric coated for protection against the highly acidic gastric_environment

the district_court ruled that these claims were invalid as obvious and rejected barrs other theories
the court found that a person having ordinary_skill in the art would have considered the krause_i ii and iii studies results that spirorenone though acid-sensitive would nevertheless absorb in vivo because drospirenone is closely related to spirorenone
it also found that while the nickisch_reference did teach that drospirenone_isomerizes in vitro when exposed to acid simulating the human_stomach a person of ordinary_skill would be aware of the studys shortcomings and would verify whether drospirenone absorbed or isomerized with precise in vivo and in vitro_testing as suggested by the robert aulton treatise pharmaceutrics the science of dosage_form_design 1988
it then held that under ksr_international_co. v. teleflex_inc. 550_u.s._398 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007) it would have been obvious to a person having ordinary_skill in pharmaceutical_formulation to try a normal_pill in formulating drospirenone as an oral_contraceptive
bayer timely appeals this ruling ; barr does not cross-appeal its adverse rulings
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

discussion
obviousness under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 is the sole issue in this appeal
whether an invention would have been obvious at the time the invention was made is a question of law which we review de novo based on underlying facts which we review for clear_error
takeda chem indus. ltd. v. alphapharm pty. ltd. 492_f.3d_1350 1355 fed.cir.2007
a district_courts finding is clearly erroneous when despite some supporting evidence we are` left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed'
forest labs. inc. v. abbott labs. 339_f.3d_1324 1328 fed.cir.2003 quoting united states v. u.s. gypsum co. 333_u.s._364 395 68_s.ct._525 92_l.ed._746_(1948)

a patent may not be obtained if the differences between the subject_matter sought to be patented and the prior_art are such that the subject_matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary_skill in the art to which the subject_matter pertains
35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a
*1347 an obviousness analysis is based on several factual inquiries
a court must examine the scope and content of the prior_art the differences between the prior_art and the claims at issue and the level of ordinary_skill in the pertinent art
graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 17-18 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966)
at that point a court may consider secondary objective evidence of non-obviousness such as commercial success long felt but unsolved need failure of others and the like
id

in ksr the supreme court stated that an invention may be found obvious if it would have been obvious to a person having ordinary_skill to try a course of conduct when there is a design need or market pressure to solve a problem and there are a finite_number of identified predictable_solutions a person of ordinary_skill has good reason to pursue the known options within his or her technical grasp
if this leads to the anticipated success it is likely the product not of innovation but of ordinary_skill and common sense
in that instance the fact that a combination was obvious to try might show that it was obvious under ¡± 103
550 u.s. at 421 127_s.ct._1727
this approach is consistent with our methodology in in re o'farrell 853_f.2d_894_(fed.cir.1988)
see proctor & gamble co. v. teva pharms
usa inc. 566_f.3d_989 996-97 fed.cir.2009 ; in re kubin 561_f.3d_1351 1359 fed.cir.2009
o'farrell observed that most inventions that are obvious were also obvious to try but found two classes where that rule of thumb did not obtain

first an invention would not have been obvious to try when the inventor would have had to try all possibilities in a field unreduced by direction of the prior_art
when` what would have beenobvious to try would have been to vary all parameters or try each of numerous possible choices until one possibly arrived at a successful result where the prior_art gave either no indication of which parameters were critical or no direction as to which of many possible choices is likely to be successful' an invention would not have been obvious
o'farrell 853 f.2d at 903
this is another way to express the ksr prong requiring the field of search to be among a` finite_number of identified' solutions
550 u.s. at 421 127_s.ct._1727 ; see also proctor & gamble 566 f.3d at 996 ; kubin 561 f.3d at 1359
it is also consistent with our interpretation that ksr requires the number of options to be` small or easily traversed'
ortho-mcneil pharm. inc. v. mylan labs. inc. 520_f.3d_1358 1364 fed.cir.2008

second an invention is not obvious to try where vague prior_art does not guide an inventor toward a particular solution
a finding of obviousness would not obtain where` what wasobvious to try was to explore a new technology or general_approach that seemed to be a promising field of experimentation where the prior_art gave only general guidance as to the particular form of the claimed invention or how to achieve it'
o'farrell 853 f.2d at 903
this expresses the same idea as the ksr requirement that the identified solutions be` predictable'
550 u.s. at 421 127_s.ct._1727 ; see also proctor & gamble 566 f.3d at 996-97 ; kubin 561 f.3d at 1359-60

because the use of drospirenone with 17a-ethinylestradiol as an oral_contraceptive was known prior_art bayer represented that the innovation was to micronize *1348 the drospirenone to increase its bioavailability and that the micronized_drospirenone would absorb with a normal_pill against the teachings of the prior_art
the district_court analyzed the prior_art and determined that micronizing drospirenone was taught and that using a normal_pill would have been obvious to try

the court first determined how the person having ordinary_skill in the art of pharmaceutical_formulation would consider the correlation of in vitro and in vivo_tests
it relied principally on robert aultons pharmacologist textbook pharmaceutics the science of dosage_form_design which as the court found teaches that` dissolution_rate data when combined with solubility.. provide an insight to the formulator into the potential in vivo absorption characteristics of a drug
however in vitro tests only have significance if they can be related to in vivo results
once such a relationship has been established in vitro dissolution tests can be used as a quality control test
( aulton p
9'
the court concluded that the person of ordinary_skill would not accept in vitro_testing as valid without a correlation to in vivo_tests

with that knowledge the court then turned to micronization
it found that aulton cut both ways on this point because it taught both that micronizing a poorly water soluble substance like drospirenone may increase its absorption rate but may also increase the rate of degradation
however aulton stated and other evidence corroborated that` it is now generally recognized that poorly soluble_drugs showing a dissolution_rate limiting step in the absorption process will be more readily bioavailable when administered in a finely subdivided [ micronized ] form with larger surfaces than as the coarse material..
the fine material often in micronized form with larger specific surface dissolves at faster rates which can lead to improved drug absorption by passive diffusion'
the district_court acknowledged that the prior_art suggested that there would be concern about the dissolution of a poorly water soluble acid-sensitive_drug but found that the prior_art generally suggests that micronization could improve the dissolution of drospirenone
it concluded that a person having ordinary_skill would have seen it as a viable_option

bayer argues that this is clear_error because the court relied on one piece of prior_art to show that micronization has been shown to work on acid-sensitive compounds
the court reviewed the hargrove reference which was a study on micronizing progesterone concluding that` it confirms that not all acid-sensitive_drugs require enteric_coating'
this is incorrect as barr agrees because progesterone is not an acid-sensitive_drug
however bayers own expert dr. james mcginity testified that micronization is the first choice solution because it presents the best_chance for success
so there remains adequate support for the conclusion that micronization was a viable_option

the district_court then moved to bayers second alleged non-obvious aspect of the invention whether the formulation should use an enteric-coated or normal tablet delivery
the court considered bayers argument that prior_art taught formulation_scientists to employ an enteric_coating on drospirenone and barrs argument that an enteric_coating is so complicated expensive cumbersome to manufacture and prone to variability that it only would be used as a last resort by formulation_scientists working with an acid-sensitive_drug
the court found neither side persuasive *1349 and considered the prior_art as the center again focusing on the aulton textbook
it found that aulton recognizes the necessity of an enteric_coating to the formulation of acid-sensitive_drugs but that an enteric_coating also introduces drawbacks including that enteric_coated_tablets have the lowest bioavailability of all drug delivery forms
poor bioavailability of drospirenone is the major problem that tack sought to solve
the district_court further found that aulton teaches that there is variability in bioavailability both intra- and inter-subject when using enteric_coated_tablets which is a significant obstacle to bayers requirement that the drug must be 99 % effective for all women

in effect while bayer argued that prior_art teaches away from using micronized_drospirenone in a normal tablet barr argued that the prior_art teaches away from using an enteric_coating
what the parties have done however is present the options available to a pharmaceutical formulator having ordinary_skill to solve the problem of acid-sensitive but hydrophobic drospirenone

barr argued that the krause_series on spirorenone is controlling because of the great similarity between spirorenone and drospirenone
the krause_series tested the bioavailability of spirorenone in vivo in humans and monkeys to determine whether there was need to develop a` pharmaceutical_formulation resistant to gastric juice'
the studies each found no spirorenone isomers in the subjects blood streams and concluded that spirorenone is absorbed before it isomerizes
furthermore an in vitro comparison found that drospirenone isomerized in ph 1 acid with a profile similar to spirorenone
the court found that the drugs were closely related in that they are both 1 acid-sensitive at similar rates 2 steroids having the same pharmacological properties 3 derivatives of the same drug 4 of the same chemical composition except for one bond and 5 from the same family of substances
the court then concluded that a person of ordinary_skill would find the drugs closely related and would therefore access these studies when formulating drospirenone
he would be led to believe that drospirenone like spirorenone may absorb in vivo but isomerize in vitro

bayer argues now that the district_court ignored key differences between drospirenone and spirorenone such as that the former isomerizes 40 % faster than the latter and that drospirenone is more soluble and thus could dissolve and isomerize in acid faster
this is irrelevant because the krause_series prior_art is not an anticipatory reference
it can be used to show that a drug formulator having ordinary_skill had a viable known option to consider with micronized unprotected drospirenone and a reasonable_expectation that drospirenone would perform similarly even if not identically to the spirorenone in the krause_series
see o'farrell 853 f.2d at 903-904` obviousness does not require absolute predictability of success.. all that is required is a reasonable_expectation of success
``

similarly bayer argued that the nickisch article teaches that drospirenone_isomerizes when exposed to acid in vitro teaching away from allowing exposure to the gastric_environment and thus suggesting the need for an enteric_coating
barr attacked the merits of the study as it would apply to the practice of drospirenone in vivo noting that nickisch did not test drospirenone in vivo to correlate its in vitro findings
barr also challenged the nickisch_reference on the grounds that *1350 drospirenone was found to isomerize slowly and would not have isomerized before the stomach emptied that the in vitro environment was too extreme to be compared to an in vivo practice and that it did not explain its testing protocols
the court found that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would recognize that nickisch establishes that drospirenone_isomerizes in vitro but would be alerted to the studys shortcomings when used in vivo

at this point a person having ordinary_skill in the art has reached a crossroads where he must choose between two known options delivery of micronized_drospirenone by a normal_pill following the spirorenone analogy in the krause_series or delivery of drospirenone by an enteric-coated_pill following the nickisch teaching that the drug needs to be protected from the stomach
this is a finite_number of identified predictable_solutions
see ksr
550 u.s. at 421 127_s.ct._1727
the prior_art would have funneled the formulator toward these two options ; he would not have been required to try all possibilities in a field unreduced by the prior_art thus avoiding the first pitfall of o'farrell 853 f.2d at 903
additionally the prior_art was not vague in pointing toward a general_approach or area of exploration but rather guided the formulator precisely to the use of either a normal_pill or an enteric-coated_pill thus avoiding the second pitfall of o'farrell
id
because the selection of micronized_drospirenone in a normal_pill led to the result anticipated by the krause_series the invention would have been obvious
see ksr 550 u.s. at 421 127_s.ct._1727

conclusion
accordingly the judgment of the united_states_district_court for the district of new_jersey is affirmed

affirmed

newman circuit_judge dissenting
with all respect to my colleagues i do not share their view that it would have been obvious to do that which was indisputably unobvious to the experienced formulation_scientists whose assignment was to formulate the known product drospirenone
the evidence showed without contradiction that it was known that micronized_drospirenone rapidly degraded at the acidity of stomach_acid
the evidence showed without contradiction that the bayer_scientists working in this field believed that the product required an enteric_coating in order to prevent degradation in the stomach upon ingestion as an oral_contraceptive
yet my colleagues employing their own expertise hold that since the scientists working in this field turned out to be mistaken it would have been obvious that it was not necessary to take steps to prevent acid_degradation
the court discounts the testimony of the scientists themselves ignores the knowledge concerning this product and its instability in acid ignores the textbook teachings and finds that this unlikely process obviously should have been tried
that is not the law of obviousness

the statutory criterion is whether the invention would have been obvious to persons of ordinary_skill at the time of the invention not whether it is sufficiently simple to appear obvious to judges after the discovery is finally made despite the years of contrary belief among the scientists charged with the project
at the time that the bayer_scientists were attempting to formulate drospirenone as an oral_contraceptive the textbook teaching was that micronizing acid-sensitive products would accelerate their acid-induced degradation
see e.g. aultons pharmaceutics the design and manufacture of *1351 medicines advising against micronizing acid-sensitive_drugs because it reduces the drugs bioavailability
my colleagues criticize these specialists and rule that it was nonetheless obvious to conduct experiments that they believed would not work
the court rules that the scientists should have` tried' that which they believed would fail and that when they eventually did try this unlikely formulation and it succeeded it was obvious to do so

the unusual physiological behavior of drospirenone in the stomach was not known ; this knowledge followed as scientific explanation ; it did not precede the invention in suit
there was no evidence to reasonably suggest that micronized_drospirenone was likely to be usable with 99+ percent consistency of effectiveness without any protection from degradation by stomach_acid
a usable contraceptive requires virtually complete_effectiveness and the standard confronting the bayer_scientists was high
unlike the unrelated drugs cited by the panel majority contraceptives require complete_effectiveness
previously known oral_contraceptives such as progesterone and spironolactone are not acid sensitive and drospirenone presented a highly specific challenge to the formulation_scientists
the bayer_scientists believed that the way of avoiding the known acid_degradation of drospirenone was to protect it from acid
my colleagues however find that it would have been obvious to expose it to acid although it was not obvious to the scientists working on the project

`` obviousness' requires that the subject_matter was obvious to persons of ordinary_skill in the field of the invention
the law does not hold it` obvious to try' experiments that contravene conventional knowledge and that are not deemed reasonably likely to succeed
the evidence in this case is a better measure of obviousness than is the hindsight science of judges for the scientists who eventually made this discovery testified without dispute that they did not believe an uncoated micronized product would meet the demanding criteria of contraceptive effectiveness
the court in ksr_international_co. v. teleflex_inc. 550_u.s._398 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007) explained that the standard for` obvious to try' is whether there was a` reasonable_expectation of success' at the time
it was undisputed that there was not
it was undisputed that it was not reasonably expected that uncoated_micronized_drospirenone would be 99+ % effective as an oral_contraceptive when ingested into the acidic stomach when it was known to degrade rapidly in acid

the district_court stated that micronization was a` viable' option and that although success was` uncertain' the invention was obvious to try
however` viability' is not the standard
`` viability' implies that the experiment may or may not succeed
what the law requires is not guesswork not dumb luck but a reasonable degree of predictability of success
my colleagues depart from the statutory standard in ruling that persons of ordinary_skill would have conducted experiments that were expected to fail
nothing in the prior_art teaches the likelihood of success of ingestion of uncoated_micronized_drospirenone ; what is taught is the likelihood of failure

the invention must be viewed as a whole
with the existing knowledge that drospirenone is both hydrophobic and that it degrades rapidly in acid and the existing knowledge that micronization although useful to counteract a drugs hydrophobic properties renders the drug even more *1352 susceptible to acid_degradation it was not shown that a person of ordinary_skill in this field would have had a reasonable_expectation of achieving complete contraceptive bioavailability and effectiveness with uncoated_micronized_drospirenone
the contrary view has surfaced only in this litigation-induced argument
the exercise of judicial expertise to override the clear evidence of how persons of skill in this field actually behaved is inappropriate
