linn circuit_judge apotex inc. and apotex_corp. collectively` apotex' appeal from the grant by the united_states_district_court for the district of new_jersey of a preliminary_injunction barring apotex from launching a generic_version of a budesonide_drug made and distributed under the approval of the united states food and drug administration` fda' by astrazeneca_lp and astrazeneca_ab collectively` astrazeneca' and covered under method and kit_claims in astrazenecas u.s
patents no._6598,603` the ¡¬603_patent` and no._6899,099` the ¡¬099_patent`
astrazeneca cross-appeals the district_courts ruling that the asserted_kit_claims in both patents are invalid
because the district_court did not abuse its discretion by granting the preliminary_injunction and did not err in determining that the kit_claims are invalid this court affirms

background
i
the drug approval process
in part this appeal concerns the procedures for obtaining permission to sell either a` new' or generic_drug under the federal food drug and cosmetic act ch
675 52_stat._1040_(1938) codified as amended in scattered sections of 21 u.s.c
under the act the fda must approve all new_drugs before such drugs may be distributed in interstate commerce
21 u.s.c.¡± 355 a
to obtain approval for a new_drug an applicant may file a new drug application` nda' that includes examples of the proposed label for the drug and clinical data demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective for use
id.¡± 355 b 1 a b 1 f
the nda must contain the patent number and expiration date of any patent that claims either the drug or a method of using the drug if` a claim of patent infringement could reasonably be asserted'
id.¡± 355 b 1
the fda publishes the names of approved drugs and their associated patent information in the approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations list commonly referred to as the` orange_book'

an applicant seeking approval to market a generic_version of a drug may file either an abbreviated new drug application` anda' or a` 505 b 2 application' which is also known as a` paper_nda'
id.¡± 355 b 2 j
an anda allows an applicant to rely on the safety and efficacy information for the listed drug if the applicant can show that the generic_drug is` bioequivalent' to the listed drug

an anda has three requirements that are particularly relevant here
first the applicant must demonstrate that` the route of administration the dosage form and the strength of the new_drug are the same as those of the listed drug' unless the fda has approved a` suitability_petition' requesting permission to file an anda that differs from the listed drug in one or more of these respects
id.¡± 355 j 2 a iii j 2 c
second subject to changes required by fda_regulations or a successful suitability_petition the applicant must also show that` the labeling proposed for the new_drug is the same as the labeling approved for the listed *1046 drug'
id.¡± 355 j 2 a v
third for each patent listed in the orange_book that claims either the listed drug or a use of the listed drug for which the applicant is requesting approval an anda must include either one of four certifications or a` section_viii_statement'

if an applicant chooses to submit a certification the applicant must certify` i that.. patent information has not been filed ii that such_patent has expired iii.. the date on which such_patent will expire or iv that such_patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture use or sale of the new_drug'
id.¡± 355 j 2 a vii i - iv
these certifications are referred to as paragraph i ii iii and iv_certifications respectively

assuming all regulatory requirements are satisfied the fda may immediately make effective the approval of an anda that includes either a paragraph i or ii certification
id.¡± 355 j 5 b i
by contrast the filing of a paragraph iii or iv_certification may delay the effective date of an anda approval and in the case of a paragraph_iv_certification invite a patent_infringement_suit
see 35 u.s.c.¡± 271 e 2 21 u.s.c.¡± 355 j 5 b ii - iii

if however an applicant is seeking approval for a method of use not claimed in a` method of use patent' associated with the listed drug the applicant must submit a section_viii_statement declaring that the patent does not claim such a use
21 u.s.c.¡± 355 j 2 a viii
the applicant must also remove or` carve out' any mention of the patented_method of use from the proposed label for the generic_drug
see 21 c.f.r.¡± 314.92 a 1 ; novo_nordisk_a/s v. caraco pharm
labs. ltd. 601_f.3d_1359 1361 fed.cir.2010` along with the section_viii_statement the generic manufacturer must submit a proposed label to the fda that does not contain the patented_method of using the listed drug`
unlike a paragraph iii or iv_certification the filing of a section_viii_statement will not by itself delay approval of an anda

finally in contrast to an anda a paper_nda must include safety and effectiveness_data
21 u.s.c.¡± 355 b 2
however a paper_nda may rely on safety and effectiveness_data not developed by the applicant
id
as with an anda a paper_nda requires the applicant to submit either a patent certification or a statement declaring that the patent does not claim the method of use for which the applicant is seeking approval
id.¡± 355 b 2 a - b

ii
astrazenecas budesonide drug and patents
in 2000 the fda approved astrazenecas nda for a budesonide_inhalation_suspension that astrazeneca now markets under the name` pulmicort_respulesthe_r'
each` respule' is a plastic vial containing a single dose of budesonide an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid suspended in a sterile liquid
the drug is administered by squeezing the entire contents of a vial into a jet nebulizer and inhaling the resulting mist through a mask attached to the nebulizer

the orange_book entry for astrazenecas budesonide_product includes the ¡¬ 099 patent and its parent the ¡¬603_patent
both patents are owned by astrazeneca and have specifications that are nearly identical in all relevant respects
the patents explain that` [ t ] he invention provides a new method of treating respiratory_diseases such as asthma that involves administering a budesonide_composition with a nebulizer not more than once per day'
¡¬ 603 patent col.1 ll.20-23 ; ¡¬099_patent col.1 ll.26-29
`` the invention also features a kit for treating respiratory_diseases the kit including a budesonide_composition in a *1047 sealed container.. and a label indicating administration by nebulization in a continuing regimen at a frequency of not more than once per day'
¡¬603_patent col.2_ll.1-6 ; ¡¬ 099 patent col.2 ll.7-12
both patents include method_claims directed to administering a budesonide_composition once daily and product claims directed to the described kit containing either a budesonide_composition or suspension and a label indicating once-daily_administration by nebulization

while astrazenecas patents are directed to once-daily treatment the label that accompanies astrazenecas budesonide_product indicates that the drug may be administered once or twice daily
the label states that the drug is available in three strengths-0.25 mg 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg per 2 ml_vial-and provides a table of recommended starting doses based on a patients history of therapy
the label repeatedly warns that patients should` titrate down' to the lowest_effective_dose of the medication to avoid any adverse_effects from excessive use of the medication
for example in its dosage and administration_section the label states that` [ i ] n all patients it is desirable to downward-titrate to the lowest_effective_dose once asthma_stability is achieved' and` [ o ] nce the desired clinical_effect is achieved consideration should be given to tapering to the lowest_effective_dose'
the precautions section also warns that` suppression of hpa function may be associated.. when the dose is not titrated to the lowest_effective_dose' and` [ t ] o minimize the systemic effects of orally inhaled corticosteroids.. each patient should be titrated to his/her lowest_effective_dose'
it is undisputed that the fda requires all manufacturers of inhaled corticosteroids such as budesonide to include this downward titration_language in the labels of their inhaled corticosteroid products

iii
apotexs anda
apotex submitted an anda seeking fda_approval to manufacture and sell a generic_version of budesonide for twice-daily_use a use not claimed in either the ¡¬603 or ¡¬099_patent s. the anda included a proposed label for the generic_drug that with certain exceptions is identical to the label included with astrazenecas budesonide_product
specifically in its label apotex replaced the` pulmicort_respulesthe_r' brand name on astrazenecas product with the generic name` budesonide_inhalation_suspension'
apotex also submitted a section_viii_statement asserting that it was not seeking approval for the once-daily_method of use claimed in the ¡¬603 and ¡¬099_patent s and that its proposed generic_label would contain no explicit mention of once-daily_administration
however the proposed label retained the fda-mandated downward-titration_language found in astrazenecas pulmicort_respulesthe_r product label
apotex further represented that the proposed label would indicate that the generic_drug is available in only two strengths 0.25 mg and 0.5 mg per 2 ml_vial
the fda approved apotexs anda on march_30,_2009

iv
proceedings before the district court
on march_31,_2009 the day after apotexs anda was approved astrazeneca initiated the declaratory judgment action underlying this appeal and moved for a preliminary_injunction barring apotex from distributing its generic budesonide_drug
in that action astrazeneca argued that apotex would directly infringe certain kit_claims in both patents claims 29_and_30 of the ¡¬603_patent and claims 17 18 20 21 and 24-27 of the ¡¬099_patent and would induce infringement of specified method *1048 claims in the ¡¬603_patent claims 1-3 6-8 11-18 and 21-28 by including the downward-titration_statements in the proposed label
astrazeneca asserted that the downward-titration_statements effectively instructed consumers to use the drug once daily
claims 1_and_29 respectively are representative of the asserted_method and kit_claims in the ¡¬603_patent 1
a method of treating a patient_suffering from a respiratory_disease the method comprising administering to the patient a nebulized dose of a budesonide_composition in a continuing regimen at a frequency of not more than once per day
¡¬603_patent col.10 ll.18-22
29
a kit for treating respiratory_diseases the kit_comprising a a budesonide_composition in a sealed container the composition containing 0.05 mg to 15 mg_budesonide and a solvent and b a label indicating administration by nebulization in a continuing regimen at a frequency of not more than once per day
id
col.12 ll.3-8

claim 17 is representative of the asserted_kit_claims in the ¡¬099_patent 17
a kit for treating a respiratory_disease the kit_comprising a a budesonide_suspension in a sealed container the suspension containing 0.05 mg to 15 mg_budesonide and a solvent and b a label indicating administration by nebulization in a continuing regimen at a frequency of not more than once per day
¡¬099_patent col.11 ll.9-14
the court held a five-day hearing on astrazenecas request for a preliminary_injunction
at the hearing apotex argued that u.s. patent no._5192,528` the ¡¬528_patent` anticipates all but three of the asserted_method_claims claims 12 14 and 16
apotex also argued that a 1994 advertisement for astrazenecas pulmicort_respulesthe_r_drug in the british medical journal thorax` the thorax_advertisement' anticipates each of the asserted_method_claims
apotex contended that the asserted_kit_claims of both patents were invalid because the claimed budesonide_composition and suspension were known in the prior_art and the recited label could not render a known product patentable

apotex further argued that it would not induce infringement of the asserted_method_claims
apotex contended that the proposed label would not lead consumers to directly infringe the claims because the downward-titration_statements included in the label did not instruct users to take the generic_drug once daily
in support of this argument apotex pointed out that the fda had previously issued a letter agreeing that the downward-titration_language did not` teach' once-daily_usage and was not protected by the ¡¬603 and ¡¬099_patent s. apotex also contended that it lacked the requisite_specific_intent to induce infringement because it was the fda that had required apotex to include the downward-titration_statements in the label
moreover because the generic_drug allegedly has substantial noninfringing uses e.g. twice-daily_administration to treat asthma apotex argued that the district_court could not infer that apotex intended to induce infringement

in the first of two opinions the district_court agreed that apotex had shown a likelihood of success in its contention that all of the asserted_kit_claims were invalid concluding that the` addition of the instruction does not functionally alter the known product so as to create a new patentable product'
astrazeneca_lp v. apotex inc.` opinion` 623_f.supp.2d_579 591 d.n.j.2009
with respect to the asserted_method_claims the court determined that under its construction of the *1049 term` budesonide_composition' apotex had not shown the asserted_method_claims likely to be anticipated by the ¡¬528_patent
id.at 595
the court likewise was not convinced that the thorax_advertisement anticipated these claims finding persuasive evidence that one of ordinary_skill in the art at the time of the invention would not have understood the advertisement to instruct once-daily_usage of astrazenecas pulmicort_respulesthe_r_drug
id.at 596

regarding inducement the district_court concluded that the downward-titration_language would lead many users to directly infringe the asserted_method_claims because titrating down from the recommended starting doses would necessarily lead to once-daily_usage
id.at 601-02
the court found that the proposed label provided evidence of apotexs affirmative_intent to induce infringement and that there was no evidence in the record that apotex had attempted to craft a noninfringing label
id.at 605 607

the district_court also found that astrazeneca would suffer irreparable_harm if the court did not issue a preliminary_injunction as the damage caused by layoffs and loss of consumer goodwill would be unquantifiable and a confidential_settlement_agreement between astrazeneca and teva pharmaceuticals` teva' made determining economic_harm speculative
id.at 611-14
the court found that the public_interest did not favor either party
id.at 614
before deciding whether to issue the requested preliminary_injunction the court offered apotex the opportunity to present additional evidence addressing whether apotex had the necessary_specific_intent to induce infringement of the asserted_method_claims
apotex accepted and presented testimony regarding apotexs efforts to develop a non-infringing label
after considering this testimony the court issued a supplemental opinion in which it concluded that astrazeneca had shown that apotex had the requisite_specific_intent to induce infringement
astrazeneca_lp v. apotex inc.` supplemental_opinion` 623_f.supp.2d_615 d.n.j.2009
the district_court then issued its preliminary_injunction
apotex filed a timely appeal and astrazeneca timely filed a cross-appeal
this court has jurisdiction under 28 u.s.c.¡± 1292 c 1

apotex appeals only the district_courts findings that astrazeneca is likely to succeed on the merits with respect to the asserted_method_claims and is likely to suffer irreparable *1050 harm in the absence of a preliminary_injunction

a
likelihood of success on the merits
for a patentee to establish that it is likely to succeed on the merits it` must demonstrate that it will likely prove infringement of one or more claims of the patents-in-suit and that at least one of those same allegedly infringed claims will also likely withstand the validity_challenges presented by the accused infringer'
amazon.com 239 f.3d at 1351
when reviewing the grant of a preliminary_injunction this court` views the matter in light of the burdens and presumptions that will inhere at trial'
titan_tire_corp. 566 f.3d at 1376 citation omitted
a preliminary_injunction should not issue if an alleged_infringer raises a substantial_question regarding either infringement or validity i.e. the alleged_infringer asserts an infringement or invalidity defense that the patentee has not shown lacks substantial merit
genentech inc. v. novo_nordisk_a/s 108_f.3d_1361 1364 fed.cir.1997

apotex contends that astrazeneca has failed on both validity and infringement
regarding validity apotex repeats its argument that the ¡¬528_patent and the thorax_advertisement anticipate the asserted_method_claims
with respect to infringement apotex renews its contention that the distribution of its generic_version of astrazenecas budesonide_product would not induce infringement because such distribution fails to show that apotex possessed the requisite_specific_intent to infringe
these contentions are addressed in turn

i
the ¡¬528_patent
the ¡¬528_patent entitled` corticosteroid inhalation treatment method' issued in 1993 several years before the filing of the application that matured into the ¡¬603_patent
the ¡¬528_patent discloses a method for treating lung conditions such as asthma by administering a suspension of budesonide` entrapped' within a liposome i.e. a spherical vesicle once daily
col.7 ll.57-63 col.8 ll.4-11

before addressing validity the district_court construed the term` budesonide_composition' in the asserted_method_claims
the court concluded that the term means` budesonide dispersed in a solvent in the form of a solution or suspension' and excludes` the involvement of liposomes as described in the ¡¬ 528 patent'
opinion at 595
in support of this construction the district_court noted that the ¡¬603_patent consistently describes the compositions used in the claimed method as either suspensions or solutions of budesonide dispersed in a solvent
id
the court also cited the testimony of dr. robert o. williams iii an expert witness presented by astrazeneca
dr._williams testified that the ¡¬603_patent discloses a` depot_effect' associated with budesonide that enables the drug to be effective when administered only once per day
prelim
inj
hr g tr
16-17 may_4,_2009
dr._williams explained that the ¡¬603_patent teaches dispersing budesonide in a solvent as either a solution i.e. budesonide dissolved in the solvent or as a suspension i.e. budesonide particles floating in the solvent
id.at 16-19
according to dr._williams dispersing budesonide in the solvent in either form places the budesonide in direct_contact with the solvent which allows the budesonide to be absorbed by lung cells where the drug binds with fatty acids and is rendered inactive
id.at 16-18
this inactive budesonide acts as a` depot' or reservoir of budesonide that replaces free_budesonide as the free_budesonide is used
id.at 16-17
he explained that unlike the liposome-entrapped budesonide disclosed *1051 in the ¡¬ 528 patent` the budesonide is provided.. in.. immediate_contact with the solvent [ ] such that.. the budesonide molecules.. are available to be absorbed by the airway cells.. and act as a depot_effect'
id.at 26-27
dr._williams testified that the ¡¬603_patent` tells one of skill in the art that its important to provide budesonide immediately in contact with the solvent either dissolved as a solution or suspended in a suspension' and later opined that providing budesonide in direct_contact with the solvent was critical to the depot_effect
id.at 17-18
based on the testimony of dr._williams the court found that the`depot_effect is at the heart of astrazenecas revolutionary method and it could not occur if the liposomes involved in the ¡¬528_patent were present'
opinion at 595
accordingly the district_court concluded that the ¡¬528_patent does not anticipate the asserted_method_claims because the patent does not disclose the claimed` budesonide_composition'
id

on appeal apotex points out that the ¡¬603_patent discloses budesonide formulations that include liposomes` [ t ] herapeutic_suspensions can also contain one or more_excipients
excipients are well known in the art and include.. liposomes..
solutions or suspensions can be encapsulated in liposomes or biodegradable_microspheres'
¡¬603_patent col.3_ll.32-39 emphases added
apotex argues that the district_court improperly relied on expert_testimony to arrive at a construction of` budesonide_composition' that excludes these formulations violating this courts warnings that claims should generally not be interpreted in a manner that excludes embodiments disclosed in the specification

in response astrazeneca argues that the district_court correctly construed the` budesonide_composition' term based on the intrinsic_evidence and expert_testimony in the record
astrazeneca contends that the district_courts reliance on the testimony of dr._williams was entirely proper as his testimony simply explained the meaning of the term` budesonide_composition' in the context of the ¡¬603_patent

there is no serious dispute that the ¡¬528_patent would anticipate the majority of the asserted_method_claims if the term` budesonide_composition' is interpreted to include the liposome embodiments disclosed in the ¡¬528_patent and would not anticipate the method_claims if the district_courts construction was correct
thus the question before us is whether the district_court correctly construed the term to exclude these embodiments
this court reviews the district_courts claim_construction de novo
cybor corp. v. fas techs. inc. 138_f.3d_1448 1456 fed.cir.1998 en banc

this court agrees with astrazeneca and concludes that the district_court was correct in its claim_construction
a claim_term is generally given its` ordinary and customary meaning' that is` the meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary_skill in the art in question at the time of the invention'
phillips v. awh corp. 415_f.3d_1303 1312-13 fed.cir.2005 en banc
`` [ t ] he person of ordinary_skill in the art is deemed to read the claim_term not only in the context of the particular claim in which the disputed term appears but in the context of the entire patent including the specification'
id.at 1313
`` [ t ] he specification may reveal a special definition given to a claim_term by the patentee that differs from the meaning it would otherwise possess
in such cases the inventors lexicography governs'
id.at 1316
the specification need not reveal such a definition explicitly
see bell atl
network servs. inc. v. covad commc'ns group inc. 262_f.3d_1258 1268 fed.cir.2001` [ a ] claim_term may *1052 be clearly redefined without an explicit statement of redefinition`
`` [ w ] hen a patentee uses a claim_term throughout the entire patent specification in a manner consistent with only a single meaning he has defined that termby implication
`` id.at 1271 quoting vitronics corp. v. conceptronic inc. 90_f.3d_1576 1582 fed.cir.1996

here the specification of the ¡¬603_patent supports the conclusion that one of ordinary_skill in the art would have understood the term` budesonide_composition' to mean` budesonide dispersed in a solvent in the form of a solution or suspension' as construed by the district_court
the specification consistently describes the budesonide_compositions in that way
the summary of the invention states that` the invention features a method of treating a patient_suffering from a respiratory_disease in which a composition e.g. a suspension of budesonide is administered by nebulization' ¡¬603_patent col.1 ll.29-31 and explains a few sentences later that` [ t ] he drug can be provided as an aqueous suspension in which the budesonide is suspended in a solvent' id
col.1 ll.37-39
the summary of the invention notes that` the invention also features a kit.. including a budesonide_composition in a sealed container the composition including 0.05 mg to 15 mg_budesonide and a solvent'
id
col.2_ll.1-6
similarly the detailed_description states that` [ t ] he drug can be delivered in a solvent e.g. in the form of a solution or a suspension'
id
col.3 ll.22-23
the detailed_description goes on to note that nebulizable budesonide is packaged in vials containing` micronized budesonide suspended in a volume e.g. 2 ml of solvent'
id
col.4 ll.12-14
the examples section describes two clinical_studies performed to determine the safety and efficacy of administering budesonide once daily
the patent discloses that in each study` [ b ] udesonide was administered once per day as a nebulized suspension'
id
col.4 ll.65-67 col.7 ll.57-60

as noted above the specification does mention liposome_formulations in two places
id
col.3_ll.32-39` [ t ] herapeutic_suspensions can also contain one or more_excipients
excipients are well known in the art and include.. liposomes..
solutions or suspensions can be encapsulated in liposomes or biodegradable micro-spheres'
( emphases added
contrary to apotexs contention however the district_courts construction does not exclude either of these formulations
the district_courts construction excludes` the involvement of liposomes as described in the ¡¬528_patent'
neither of the liposome_formulations discussed in the specification use liposomes in the manner described in the ¡¬528_patent
the ¡¬528_patent describes entrapping budesonide in a liposome
such entrapment separates the budesonide from the surrounding solvent
by contrast the reference in the specification to placing liposomes in a suspension as an excipient indicates a formulation where budesonide and liposomes are in the same suspension with the liposomes independent of and apart from the budesonide which remains in contact with the solvent
the statement that` [ s ] olutions or suspensions can be encapsulated in liposomes or biodegradable_microspheres' indicates that budesonide either dissolved or floating in a solvent may be placed within a liposome not that the term` budesonide_composition' includes budesonide separated from a solvent by a liposome as described in the ¡¬528_patent

the specification and the claims are not the only sources that a court may consider when determining the meaning of a claim_term
a court may look to` those sources available to the public that show *1053 what a person of skill in the art would have understood disputed claim language to mean' which in addition to the claims and the rest of the specification may include` the prosecution_history [ ] and extrinsic evidence concerning relevant scientific principles the meaning of technical terms and the state of the art'

here the record includes the testimony of astrazenecas expert dr._williams
this court generally views expert_testimony` as less reliable than the patent and its prosecution_history in determining how to read claim_terms'
id.at 1318
however expert_testimony can be useful` for a variety of purposes such as to provide background on the technology at issue to explain how an invention_works [ or ] to ensure that the courts understanding of the technical aspects of the patent is consistent with that of a person of skill in the art..' id.at 1318
in this case the district_court properly relied on the testimony of dr._williams to understand how the claimed invention_works and construed the disputed term in a manner consistent with that understanding
as described above dr._williams explained that the ¡¬ 603 patent discloses that the depot_effect permits budesonide to be effective when administered once daily and opined that for the depot_effect to occur budesonide must be in direct_contact with the solvent
he also testified that one of skill in the art would have understood the ¡¬603_patent to disclose budesonide in immediate_contact with the solvent as either a solution or suspension
this would exclude the liposome-entrapped embodiments disclosed in the ¡¬528_patent
although apotex takes issue with the district_courts reliance on dr._williamss testimony apotex does not seriously dispute his explanation of how the claimed invention_works and provided no testimony to the contrary at the preliminary_injunction hearing
this court sees no error in relying on uncontested expert_testimony to explain how the invention described in the intrinsic record functions
see netword llc v. centraal corp. 242_f.3d_1347 1356 fed.cir.2001` [ a ] district_court can not be faulted for relying on the only expert explanation of the technology that was presented
``

considered together the intrinsic_evidence and expert_testimony support the conclusion that a person skilled in the art would have understood the term` budesonide_composition' to mean` budesonide dispersed in a solvent in the form of a solution or suspension' and excludes` the involvement of liposomes as described in the ¡¬528_patent
`` 1 accordingly this court *1054 concludes that based on the evidence of record at this point the district_court correctly construed this term and thus correctly found that the asserted_method_claims are likely to withstand the validity_challenge posed by the ¡¬528_patent

ii
the thorax advertisement
as discussed above a british medical journal published the thorax_advertisement in 1994 more than one year before the filing of the application that issued as the ¡¬603_patent
the advertisement touts astrazenecas pulmicort_respulesthe_r_drug as` [ a ] high-dose nebulised steroid thats low on side effects' and notes that the drug can be used to treat bronchial asthma in children
the advertisement indicates that the drug was available in 2 ml single dose vials each vial containing either 0.25 mg/ml or 0.5 mg/ml of budesonide
the advertisement includes the following statement regarding dosing initially.. the recommended dose in adults.. is usually 1-2 mg twice daily.. children.. 0.5-1 mg twice daily
the maintenance_dose should be the lowest_dose which keeps the patient_symptom-free
recommended doses are adults.. 0.5-1 mg twice daily
children.. 0.25-0.5 mg twice daily
when the advertisement was published astrazenecas budesonide_product was not approved for any use in the united states and was approved for only twice-daily_use in europe

because it is undisputed that the asserted_method_claims cover the use of budesonide solution the only question before the district_court was whether the advertisement disclosed administering that solution` in a continuing regimen at a frequency of not more than once per day' as recited in the claims
the district_court found that the advertisement does not anticipate the asserted_method_claims finding persuasive the explanation of astrazenecas expert dr. bradley chipps that the advertisement does not explicitly or inherently disclose once-daily dosing because the advertisement was published` before we had any information or historical_perspective that once a day_therapy worked for anyone'
opinion at 596
the district_court reached that conclusion with the understanding of dr._chipps who also testified that if made today the statement` [ t ] he maintenance_dose should be the lowest_dose which keeps the patient_symptom-free' would be equivalent to the downward-titration_language included in the proposed label that astrazeneca claimed would induce infringement of the asserted_method_claims

on appeal apotex asserts that if the language in the thorax_advertisement would today suggest to those in the art the possibility of administering the drug once daily it would also have suggested this possibility when the advertisement was published regardless of whether anyone had proven that the drug could be effective when administered once per day
apotex argues that in concluding otherwise the district_court improperly imposed a temporal limitation on the anticipation inquiry violating the oft-repeated axiom` that which would literally infringe if later in time anticipates if earlier'
astrazeneca responds that because the drug was only approved for twice-daily_use and was not known to be safe or effective when administered once daily there is nothing to show that one of skill in the art at the time the *1055 patent application was filed would have understood the advertisement to disclose once-daily dosing
astrazeneca thus argues that the thorax_advertisement was not enabling and for that reason can not be considered anticipatory
in any event astrazeneca argues that the reference simply does not disclose once-daily dosing

while the question is close this court agrees with astrazeneca that the district_court correctly determined that astrazeneca has demonstrated that the asserted_method_claims will likely withstand the validity_challenge presented by the thorax_advertisement
in the context of anticipation the question is not whether a prior_art_reference` suggests' the claimed subject matter as posited by apotex
rather` the dispositive question regarding anticipation [ is ] whether one skilled in the art would reasonably understand or infer from a [ prior_art_reference ]' that every claim element is disclosed in that reference

and although a reference must be enabling to be anticipatory see sanofi-synthelabo 550 f.3d at 1082 unlike enablement under ¡± 112 a reference need not as astrazeneca suggests demonstrate utility or efficacy to be enabling in the context of ¡± 102 see in re gleave 560_f.3d_1331 1335-36 fed.cir.2009` [ a ] reference need disclose no independent use or utility to anticipate a claim under ¡± 102

`` id
( quoting in re hafner 56_c.c.p.a._1424 410_f.2d_1403 1405 ccpa 1969

apotexs argument that the thorax_advertisement is anticipatory because the advertisement and the proposed label are essentially the same ignores a key difference between the advertisement and the proposed label
as discussed in greater detail in the next section depending on a patients previous therapy the proposed label recommends initially administering 0.25 mg of budesonide twice daily
the district_court concluded that the proposed label would induce infringement because absent instructions to the contrary titrating down to the lowest_effective_dose from the recommended starting dose of 0.25 mg of budesonide twice daily would necessarily lead some users to take 0.25 mg of budesonide once daily as a maintenance_dose as there would be no way to properly administer less than 0.25 mg of the drug
by contrast the thorax_advertisement explicitly discloses that such maintenance_doses should be administered twice daily
immediately after the advertisement warns that` [ t ] he maintenance_dose should be the lowest_dose which keeps the patient_symptom-free' the advertisement sets out recommended doses for adults and children 0.5-1 mg twice daily for adults and 0.25-0.5 mg twice daily for children
the most natural reading of this passage is *1056 that the recommended doses are recommended maintenance_doses which the advertisement explicitly states should be administered twice daily
thus although dr._chipps testified that the statement` [ t ] he maintenance_dose should be the lowest_dose which keeps the patient_symptom-free' would if made today be equivalent to the downward-titration_language included in the proposed label the advertisement-unlike the proposed label-clearly states how often a maintenance_dose should be given twice per day

dr._chipps confirmed that one of ordinary_skill in the art would have understood the advertisement to disclose administering budesonide twice-daily not once per day as argued by apotex
he testified that` theres nothing in [ the thorax_advertisement ] that talks about or alludes to once a day dosage' and noted that the advertisement instructs that the recommended starting and maintenance_doses are to be administered twice daily
prelim
inj
hr g tr
144 may_4,_2009
dr._chipps opined that when the thorax_advertisement was published in 1994 a physician reading the dosing_recommendations set forth in the advertisement would not have understood the dosing_recommendations to teach once-daily dosing
id.at 144
he explained that until astrazeneca conducted clinical_studies on its budesonide_product in 1997 there was no evidence that administering budesonide once-daily would be safe and effective
indeed he noted that prior to 1997 the lowest_dose of budesonide known to be effective was 0.25 mg taken twice a day
id.at 147-48
apotex presented no testimony or evidence to the contrary

after considering the reference and appreciating how that reference would have been understood by persons of ordinary_skill in the art at that time this court is not left with a definite and firm_conviction that the district_court clearly erred by concluding that at trial apotex will likely not be able to demonstrate by clear and convincing_evidence that the thorax_advertisement anticipates the asserted_method_claims.2 accordingly the district_courts determination is affirmed

inducement
`` whoever actively induces infringement of a patent shall be liable as an infringer'
35 u.s.c.¡± 271 b
`` [ i ] nducement requires that the alleged_infringer knowingly induced infringement and possessed specific_intent to encourage anothers infringement'

`` a factual finding is clearly erroneous when despite some supporting evidence the reviewing court is left with the definite and firm_conviction that a mistake has been made'
id.at 1361 citation omitted

*1057 before the district_court astrazeneca contended that apotexs proposed label would induce consumers to infringe the asserted_method_claims because the label implicitly instructed users to administer the generic_drug once daily
as in astrazenecas pulmicort_respulesthe_r_drug_label the dosage and administration_section of the proposed generic_label explains that` [ i ] n all patients it is desirable to downward-titrate to the lowest_effective_dose once asthma_stability is achieved'
the section also includes the following table of recommended starting doses and highest recommended doses which differs from astrazenecas label in the removal of all mention of once-daily dosing

previous therapy

recommended starting dose

highest recommended dose

bronchodilators

0.5 mg_total_daily_dose

oral
corticosteroids

1 mg_total
daily_dose

1 mg_total
daily_dose

in the paragraph following the table the label again warns that` [ o ] nce the desired clinical_effect is achieved consideration should be given to tapering to the lowest_effective_dose'
the district_court agreed with astrazeneca that the proposed label would cause some users to infringe the asserted_method_claims
the proposed label indicates that the generic_drug will be available in only two strengths 0.25 mg and 0.5 mg per 2 ml_vial
the court noted that once opened each vial of the generic_drug must immediately be administered in its entirety because dividing the contents of a vial for use at different times would compromise the drugs sterility
opinion at 600_n._17
because the recommended starting dose for patients in the first two rows of the dosing table is` 0.5 mg_total_daily_dose administered twice daily in divided_doses' i.e. 0.25 mg administered twice a day the court reasoned that the first step in titrating down from this dose would have to be 0.25 mg once daily as there was no way of decreasing the amount of each dose below 0.25 mg. id.at 602
accordingly the court concluded that for patients whose previous treatments fell within the first two rows of the dosage table the downward-titration_language would necessarily lead patients to use a 0.25 mg vial of the drug once-daily

the district_court found that a letter issued by the fda supported this conclusion
in 2008 astrazeneca filed a citizen petition with the fda concerning an anda submitted by ivax pharmaceuticals inc.` ivax' that is virtually identical to the anda submitted by apotex
in the petition astrazeneca asked the fda to determine that labeling for a generic_budesonide_inhalation_suspension must include once-daily dosing language
astrazeneca also questioned the propriety of including downward-titration_language in a proposed label for a generic_budesonide_inhalation_suspension
in response the fda issued a letter explaining that the labeling for a generic_budesonide_inhalation_suspension could omit references to once-daily dosing` [ b ] ecause the weight of the evidence is stronger in support of efficacy for twice-daily dosing as opposed to once-daily dosing.. omission of once-daily dosing in the generic bis labeling would not render the generic_drug less safe or effective than pulmicort_respulesthe_r'
letter from the fda to astrazeneca 16 nov._18,_2008
the letter *1058 also stated that the fda found it appropriate to include the downward-titration_language in proposed labeling for generic_budesonide_inhalation_suspensions because the fda believed that the language did not` teach' once-daily dosing titration to the lowest_effective_dose may involve for example a twice-daily regimen once-daily dosing or even alternate day dosing..
the labeling does not state the lowest_effective_dose is 0.25 mg once daily
as such contrary to your assertion the downward_titration_statement does not` teach' once-daily dosing
.....
the downward_titration_statement does not specify or instruct that the dosing frequency must be once daily and need not be carved out as protected by the 6,598 603_and_6899,099 patents
id.at 18
the district_court concluded that the letter supported the courts finding of direct_infringement because the letter explicitly stated and therefore put apotex on notice that downward titration may involve once-daily dosing
opinion at 601

regarding specific_intent to induce infringement the district_court found that astrazeneca had submitted evidence of apotexs affirmative_intent that consumers use the generic_drug in an infringing manner apotexs inclusion of the downward-titration_language in the proposed label
id.at 605
the court also noted that apotex had presented no evidence that the company had attempted to draft a non-infringing label
id.at 606-07
because the question of apotexs efforts to draft a non-infringing label had arisen late in the proceedings the court offered apotex the opportunity to continue the hearing and present evidence on this issue

apotex accepted the courts offer and presented bernice tau the director of regulatory affairs at apotex to testify at the hearing
tau testified that in addition to removing all explicit references to once-daily dosing at the advice of counsel apotex had also inserted the phrase` by administration twice-daily' in sections of the proposed label that apotex included with its anda
prelim
inj
hr g tr
19 21-22 may_20,_2009
she explained that the fda responded by instructing apotex to delete this phrase and sending apotex a template containing the language apotex was to include in the proposed label
id.at 22-23

tau stated that apotex never intended to instruct or encourage either physicians or patients to use its generic_drug once-daily
id.at 32
she also testified that it never occurred to apotex that the downward-titration_statements in the proposed label would suggest once-daily_use of apotexs generic_version of the drug
id.at 27
she explained that she became aware that the language was problematic after apotex obtained approval of its anda when apotexs counsel notified her that astrazeneca was objecting to use of the language
id.at 27 37
she stated that after learning of the issue she made two calls to the fda to address astrazenecas concerns and proposed the following three amendments to the label 1 adding the words` twice daily' to the downward-titration_language ; 2 adding language stating the drug is not approved for less than twice-daily_use ; and 3 removing the downward-titration_language
id.at 27-31
she testified that she did so despite believing based on her experience with the fda that the fda would not allow apotex to alter the label
id.at 27-28
she stated that during these calls the fda informed her of the letter it issued in response to astrazenecas petition
id.at 37-38
as she expected the fda did not permit apotex to make any of the suggested *1059 changes
she explained that apotex did not submit a formal labeling amendment because based on her conversations with the fda she believed doing so would have been futile
id.at 33-34

tau acknowledged that she knew that fda decisions could be appealed but stated that she was not familiar with the process as she had never had to appeal an fda decision regarding an anda
id.at 37 40
tau also admitted that had apotex wanted to seek approval to distribute a different strength of the generic_drug apotex could have submitted a suitability_petition but she explained that she thought this was unnecessary because apotexs anda satisfied all of the applicable requirements
id.at 11-12 52-53

based on the evidence presented on the hearing the district_court found that apotex` was aware of and certainly concerned about the potential infringement problem posed by its label' but nevertheless decided to proceed with the label
opinion at 618
the district_court noted that apotex had other options at its disposal that it chose not to pursue
the court pointed out that apotex could have formally appealed the fdas decision
id
the court also noted that apotex could have filed a suitability_petition or a paper_nda that sought approval to produce the generic_drug at a strength of 0.125 mg per 2 ml
at that strength astrazeneca conceded that the downward-titration_language would not teach an infringing use
id.at 619 & n. 3
the court found that this conduct showed that apotex had the requisite_specific_intent to induce infringement and granted astrazenecas request for a preliminary_injunction
id.at 618-19

apotex joined by two amici mounts multiple challenges to the district_courts finding that apotex had the necessary_specific_intent to induce infringement
apotex first contends that the district_court inferred specific_intent to induce infringement from apotexs planned_distribution of the generic_drug
apotex argues that drawing such an inference is improper where the product in question has substantial non-infringing uses
astrazeneca responds that the district_court based its specific_intent_finding not on an improper inference but rather on the circumstances surrounding apotexs decision to proceed with its planned_distribution of the generic_drug and the affirmative evidence of intent provided by the proposed label

this court agrees with astrazeneca
apotex is correct that` where a product has substantial noninfringing uses intent to induce infringement can not be inferred even when the [ alleged inducer ] has actual knowledge that some users of its product may be infringing the patent'
warner-lambert co. v. apotex_corp. 316_f.3d_1348 1365 fed.cir.2003
however` liability for active inducement may be foundwhere evidence goes beyond a products characteristics or the knowledge that it may be put to infringing uses and shows statements or actions directed to promoting infringement
`` ricoh co. v. quanta computer inc. 550_f.3d_1325 1341 fed.cir.2008 quoting metro-goldwyn-mayer studios inc. v. grokster ltd.` grokster` 545_u.s._913 935 125_s.ct._2764 162_l.ed.2d_781_(2005)
as the supreme court explained in grokster in the context of infringement under the copyright laws` [ e ] vidence of active steps.. taken to encourage direct_infringement such as advertising an infringing use or instructing how to engage in an infringing use show an affirmative_intent that the product be used to infringe'
545 u.s. at 936 125_s.ct._2764 internal_quotation_marks and citations omitted

the district_court correctly concluded that such evidence exists here
as an initial matter the district_court suggested *1060 that there was insufficient evidence to establish that any noninfringing use of the generic_drug was substantial calling into question the applicability of the` substantial non-infringing use' doctrine in this case
opinion at 605_n._25
be that as it may the district_court found that apotex had the requisite_specific_intent to induce infringement because apotex included instructions in its proposed label that will cause at least some users to infringe the asserted_method_claims
id.at 605
the district_court also found that despite being aware of the infringement problem presented by the proposed label apotex nonetheless proceeded with its plans to distribute its generic_drug product
supplemental_opinion at 618
this conduct not merely the planned_distribution of the generic_drug formed the basis of the district_courts specific_intent_finding
see id.at 618-19
to the extent that apotex contends that such circumstantial evidence can not support a finding of specific_intent this court has explicitly stated otherwise
water techs corp. v. calco ltd. 850_f.2d_660 668 fed.cir.1988` while proof of intent is necessary direct evidence is not required ; rather circumstantial evidence may suffice'
( citation omitted

apotex next contends that the proposed label is not evidence of specific_intent because warnings on drug_labels do not influence how a drug is used
apotex further argues that even if labels did affect how drugs are used the district_court erroneously determined that the downward-titration_language would lead the generic_drug to be used in an infringing manner
apotex asserts that the label does not instruct users to titrate down from a specific starting dose ; instead the label contains a general recommendation that is applicable to any dosing regimen

this court disagrees
in the context of specific_intent it is irrelevant that some users may ignore the warnings in the proposed label
the pertinent question is whether the proposed label instructs users to perform the patented_method
if so the proposed label may provide evidence of apotexs affirmative_intent to induce infringement
see vita-mix corp. v. basic holding inc. 581_f.3d_1317 1329_n._2_(fed.cir.2009)` the question is not.. whether a user following the instructions may end up using the device in an infringing way
rather it is whether [ the ] instructions teach an infringing use of the device such that we are willing to infer from those instructions an affirmative_intent to infringe the patent`
even if apotex were correct that the downward-titration_language may be applied to other dosing regimens the language is still applicable to the recommended starting doses and as correctly determined by the district_court would inevitably lead some consumers to practice the claimed method

apotex and the amici also argue that the proposed label alone is not sufficient evidence of specific_intent because the fda required apotex to include the downward-titration_language in the label and stated that the language does not teach the patented_method
apotex asserts that it agrees with the fda and has never believed that the downward-titration_language teaches the claimed once-daily_method of administration
in response astrazeneca contends that apotexs compliance with fda_requirements and agreement with the fdas opinion regarding the downward-titration is immaterial
astrazeneca argues that if apotex could not create a noninfringing label apotex should have waited for the ¡¬603_patent to expire before attempting to market its generic_drug

this court again agrees with astrazeneca
as explained above the district_courts specific_intent_finding was not *1061 based solely on the proposed label but also on apotexs decision to proceed with its plan to distribute the drug despite being aware that the label presented infringement problems
apotex and the amici make much of the hobsons choice they contend that apotex faced either comply with fda_requirements and risk a patent_infringement_suit or remove the downward-titration_language and ensure that the anda would not be approved
this court sees no such dilemma
apotex was free to submit a paragraph iii certification and wait until the patents expired before distributing its generic_drug or file a paragraph_iv_certification and challenge infringement and validity of the asserted claims
or as observed by the district_court apotex could have formally appealed the fdas denial of apotexs proposed labeling amendments or filed either a suitability_petition or a paper_nda seeking approval for a 0.125 mg per 2 ml strength of the drug

apotexs reliance on the fdas statements that the downward-titration_language does not` teach' once-daily dosing and is not protected by the ¡¬603 and ¡¬099_patent s is misplaced
as acknowledged by both the parties and the district_court the fda is not the arbiter of patent infringement issues

``

in light of the evidence presented to the district_court this court is not left with a definite and firm_conviction that a mistake has been made
thus this court affirms the district_courts finding that astrazeneca will likely prove induced infringement at trial

b. irreparable harm
the district_court found that astrazeneca would suffer three types of irreparable_harm if the court did not grant the requested preliminary_injunction
first the court determined that a confidential_settlement_agreement between astrazeneca and teva would make calculating the economic_harm from a premature launch of apotexs generic budesonide impossible
second the court concluded that astrazeneca would incur unquantifiable damage to its reputation and goodwill if apotex were allowed to launch its generic_drug and was subsequently forced to remove the drug from the market
third the court found that the damage caused by layoffs stemming from entry of the generic_drug into the market would also be significant and unquantifiable
apotex challenges each of these findings and each finding is considered in turn

i
the settlement agreement
on november 18 2008 teva received fda_approval to distribute a generic_version of astrazenecas budesonide_drug and immediately began its distribution
later that day astrazeneca initiated a patent_infringement_suit in the district_court against teva and successfully moved the court for a temporary restraining order enjoining teva from selling the generic_drug
astrazeneca and teva subsequently entered into a settlement_agreement that granted teva an exclusive license to sell its generic_drug beginning december 15 2009 with teva agreeing to pay astrazeneca *1062 a significant royalty
the agreement also included a` step down' provision that reduced the amount teva was obligated to pay astrazeneca if unlicensed drug manufacturers launched generic_versions of the drug and certain conditions were met
in addition teva agreed to pay astrazeneca a specified amount for damages caused by tevas unauthorized launch of its generic_drug

the district_court observed that under the settlement_agreement astrazeneca would continue to have market exclusivity until december 15 2009 and that after that date astrazeneca and teva would share the market
based on expert_testimony the court concluded that to reliably calculate the economic_harm astrazeneca would suffer after december 15 2009 the court would need data reflecting a market including only_astrazeneca and teva
because apotexs planned launch would prevent a market with only_astrazeneca and teva from ever occurring the district_court determined that it would be` complete speculation to put a number on what this market would have been worth to astrazeneca'
opinion at 611
the court dismissed apotexs argument that` the parties expectations when they entered into the licensing agreement' would be sufficient to calculate damages explaining that` there is a distinction between what the parties expect and what actually would have occurred' and concluding that it would be impossible to calculate with reasonable certainty the economic damage that astrazeneca would suffer under the settlement_agreement if apotex began distributing its generic_drug
id

apotex argues on appeal that testimony during the hearing established that during the settlement negotiations astrazeneca and teva had estimated the required market data
because this information would be subject to discovery apotex contends that district_court clearly erred when the court concluded that the damages_astrazeneca would suffer would be incalculable

in response astrazeneca suggests that the data generated during the settlement negotiations was influenced by the relative bargaining power of the parties and is not an accurate reflection of a market with only_astrazeneca and teva
astrazeneca argues that without the benefit of actual data from such a market any damages calculation would be based on speculation

this court agrees with astrazeneca
both astrazeneca and apotex rely on the testimony of richard fante the president of astrazeneca
fante admitted that astrazeneca and teva did forecast certain market data during the settlement negotiation but characterized the negotiation as a` gun-to-head moment' and explained that the companies relied mostly on` the experience wed had as executives' when generating the forecast
prelim
inj
hr g tr
63-64 apr._30,_2009
given the lack of reliable data regarding a market with only_astrazeneca and teva this court is not left with a definite and firm_conviction that the district_court erred by concluding that the damages_astrazeneca would incur under the settlement_agreement would be incalculable

ii
goodwill
the district_court found that if apotex began distributing its generic_drug and was subsequently forced to remove the drug from the market the resulting confusion among physicians and patients as well as price changes would cause unquantifiable harm to astrazenecas goodwill
apotex asserts that this finding is speculative as certain provisions of the settlement_agreement would mitigate if not eliminate any adverse_effects of apotex launching and then removing its generic_drug from the market
although this court agrees *1063 with apotex that there has not been a particularly strong showing regarding this finding after reviewing the record this court concludes that the district_court did not clearly err by determining that astrazeneca will suffer incalculable harm to its goodwill

iii
layoffs
based on the testimony of fante the district_court concluded that astrazeneca would have to lay off some of its employees if apotex launched its generic_drug and the resulting noneconomic loss would be significant and unquantifiable
opinion at 612
the parties dispute regarding this finding largely concerns whether fante testified that he would have to lay off employees if apotex launched its generic_drug or merely testified that layoffs might occur in that situation
apotex points out that when asked whether apotexs entry would force him to lay off employees at astrazenecas manufacturing_facility fante responded` it could'

however as noted by astrazeneca fante later clarified that if apotex and teva were both in the market that` in that scenario we would have to have a layoff [ in the manufacturing_facility ]'
id
moreover when asked what effect apotexs launch would have on astrazeneca employees fante explained that` [ u ] ndoubtedly..
i would have to have a further reduction in the size of the u.s
workforce'
id.at 47
similarly when asked whether this reduction would occur if apotex launched its product after december 15 he stated` absolutely'
id
given this undisputed_testimony this court discerns no clear_error in the district_courts finding
this court has reviewed the other arguments raised by apotex concerning this finding and conclude that they too lack merit

* * *

because apotex has not demonstrated that any of the district_courts findings regarding irreparable_harm are clearly erroneous this court sees no reason to disturb the district_courts determination that astrazeneca would suffer irreparable_harm

ii
the kit claims
the asserted_kit_claims recite two elements 1 a budesonide_composition or suspension in a sealed container containing 0.05 mg to 15 mg_budesonide and a solvent and 2 a label indicating administration by nebulization in a continuing regimen at a frequency of not more than once per day
see e.g. ¡¬603_patent col.12 ll.3-8 ; ¡¬099_patent col.11 ll.9-14
the district_court concluded that the kit_claims are invalid finding the claimed budesonide_composition and suspension were known in the prior_art and that the instructions in the claimed label are non-statutory subject matter and therefore not entitled to patentable_weight
opinion at 589-92
regarding the instructions in the label the district_court explained that under federal circuit precedent` [ w ] here.. printed matter is not functionally related to the substrate the printed matter will not distinguish the invention from the prior_art in terms of patentability'
id.at 590 citation omitted
this court noted that here the parties disputed what constitutes the substrate with apotex contending that the label is the substrate and astrazeneca asserting that the substrate is the drug
id.at 592
after considering our precedent the district_court concluded that this dispute was immaterial because regardless of how the substrate was defined` the instructions simply explain how to use the known product
this type of relationship does not qualify as a functional one..' id.at 591

*1064 astrazeneca argues that a drug_label and its associated drug are` inextricably interrelated' as a drug can not be approved unless and until the fda approves its label
astrazeneca notes that fda_regulations require the label for a drug to include information needed for proper use of the drug and argues that without the label a physician would be unable to safely and effectively treat patients
in light of this astrazeneca contends that a drug_label is essential to physicians when prescribing a drug and therefore is functionally related to the drug

apotex counters that for the purposes of determining whether the claimed label is entitled to patentable_weight the relationship between the drug and the label is irrelevant
according to apotex the proper inquiry is whether there is a functional_relationship between the printed matter and its substrate i.e. the object the printed matter is printed on
apotex contends that here the printed matter is the instruction for once-daily_use and the substrate is the paper label
citing in re ngai 367_f.3d_1336_(fed.cir.2004) apotex argues that the instructions are not functionally related to the label on which they are printed because they do not function together in any way

there is no dispute that the budesonide_suspension recited in the claims is known in the prior_art
the question before us is whether the district_court correctly determined that the recitation in the claims of a label instructing not more than once-a-day dosing is of no patentable consequence
this court reviews de novo the district_courts determination that the asserted claims recite non-statutory subject matter
see in re comiskey 554_f.3d_967 975 fed.cir.2009 explaining that` whether the asserted claims.. are invalid for failure to claim statutory subject matter under 35 u.s.c.¡± 101 [ ] is a question of law which we review without deference'
( quoting at & t corp. v. excel commc'ns inc. 172_f.3d_1352 1355 fed.cir.1999

the categories of patentable_subject_matter are set forth in 35 u.s.c.¡± 101 whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process machine manufacture or composition of matter or any new and useful improvement thereof may obtain a patent therefor subject to the conditions and requirements of this title

this court has generally found printed matter to fall outside the scope of ¡± 101
see in re chatfield 545_f.2d_152 157 ccpa 1976` some inventions however meritorious do not constitute patentable_subject_matter e.g. printed matter..' citation omitted
however as observed by the district_court this court has long recognized an exception to this general rule if there is a` functional_relationship' between the printed matter and its substrate the printed matter may serve to distinguish the invention from the prior_art
see in re miller 57_c.c.p.a._809 418_f.2d_1392 1396 ccpa 1969 ; in re gulack 703_f.2d_1381 1385-87 fed.cir.1983

this court considered the printed matter exception in ngai a case similar to the one now before us
in ngai the board affirmed the rejection of a claim reciting a kit_comprising instructions to amplify ribonucleic acids
the board found that the only difference between the claimed kit and the prior_art was the content of the claimed instructions
concluding that this content was not functionally related to the kit the board found that the claim was anticipated by the prior_art
this court affirmed rejecting the argument that the addition of new printed matter to a known product makes the product patentable
this court reasoned that` the printed matter in no way depends on the kit and the *1065 kit does not depend on the printed matter
all that the printed matter does is teach a new use for an existing product'
ngai 367 f.3d at 1339

this court agrees with apotex that as in ngai the claimed instructions here are not entitled to patentable_weight
the instructions in no way function with the drug to create a new unobvious product
removing the instructions from the claimed kit does not change the ability of the drug to treat respiratory_diseases
although astrazeneca is correct that fda_regulations require a label containing information needed for the safe and effective use of any drug this is a requirement for fda_approval not patentability

this court also agrees with the district_court that the dispute over whether the` substrate' is the label or the drug is immaterial for in both cases the instructions do nothing more than explain how to use the known drug
our decision in ngai foreclosed the argument that simply adding new instructions to a known product creates the functional_relationship necessary to distinguish the product from the prior_art
as explained in ngai if this court concluded otherwise` anyone could continue patenting a product indefinitely provided that they add a new instruction sheet to the product'
367 f.3d at 1339
neither the patent act nor our precedent countenances such an outcome
the district_courts determination that the kit_claims are invalid is affirmed

conclusion
for the foregoing reasons this court concludes that the district_court did not abuse its discretion by granting the preliminary_injunction and did not err in determining that the kit_claims are invalid

affirmed

bryson circuit_judge concurring in part and dissenting in part
i concur in the portion of the courts opinion sustaining the district_courts ruling that the` kit' claims of astrazenecas ¡¬603 and ¡¬099_patent s are invalid
because i believe apotex has raised a substantial_question of invalidity as to the other claims of the ¡¬603_patent see amazon.com inc. v. barnesandnoble.com inc. 239_f.3d_1343 1359 fed.cir.2001 i would reverse the district_courts grant of a preliminary_injunction

apotex has asserted that two prior_art_references anticipate the claims in dispute the ¡¬528_patent and the thorax_advertisement

1
the district_courts ruling that the ¡¬528_patent does not anticipate the ¡¬603_claims was predicated on an unduly narrow claim_construction of the term` budesonide_composition' in the ¡¬603_claims
the courts construction required the budesonide to be` dispersed in a solvent in the form of a solution or a suspension' and it excluded` the involvement of liposomes as described in the ¡¬528 [ reference ]'
the claims of the ¡¬603_patent however are broader than that

claim 1 the only independent method claim of the ¡¬603_patent recites the administration of a` nebulized dose of a budesonide_composition in a continuing regimen at a frequency of not more than once per day'
even assuming that the reference to a` nebulized' dose requires dispersion in a solvent nothing in the patent mandates a particular manner in which the budesonide and the solvent are to be combined

more specifically contrary to the testimony of astrazenecas expert dr._williams the ¡¬603_patent does not require that the budesonide of the` budesonide_composition' be directly suspended or dissolved *1066 in a solvent free from encapsulation or entrapment within liposomes
in fact the language of the patent undercuts dr._williamss rationale for that interpretation
while dr._williams assumed that use of the` depot_effect' with which liposome involvement may interfere is a critical aspect of the invention of the ¡¬603_patent the specification explicitly disavows any need for the depot_effect to occur
thus after describing the depot_effect the specification states` this proposed mechanism of action is exemplary ; the invention is not limited by any particular_mechanism of action'
¡¬603_patent col._3,_ll._12-13
that language indicates that the patentees did not consider the depot_effect to be essential to the effectiveness of once-daily-or-less dosing as dr._williams claimed
because the patented_method of treatment encompasses mechanisms of action other than the depot_effect the term` budesonide_composition' need not consist of budesonide directly dispersed in solvent and it need not exclude the involvement of liposomes as described in the ¡¬528 reference
the ¡¬528 reference therefore appears to anticipate or render obvious the asserted claims under the proper construction of the term` budesonide_composition'

2
with respect to the 1994 advertisement for pulmicort_respulesthe_r in the journal thorax astrazeneca concedes that the advertisement discloses every limitation of the asserted_method_claims except for the frequency of drug administration` not more than once per day'
on that issue the district_court stated [ a ] lthough the thorax_advertisement states that` [ t ] he maintenance_dose should be the lowest_dose which keeps the patient_symptom-free [ ]' dr._chipps testified that this statement does not instruct once-daily dosing because the ad was published` back in 1994.. before we had any information or historical_perspective that once a day_therapy worked for anybody'
the court finds this answer persuasive
astrazeneca_lp v. apotex inc. 623_f.supp.2d_579 596 d.n.j.2009
the district_court concluded that at the time of its publication the thorax_advertisement did not enable once-daily dosing because a person of skill in the art in 1994 would not have believed that once-daily_administration of pulmicort_respulesthe_r would be effective
as the majority acknowledges however a prior_art_reference need not demonstrate utility in order to serve as an anticipating reference under section 102
rasmusson v. smithkline_beecham_corp. 413_f.3d_1318 1326 fed.cir.2005

the thorax_advertisement contains a list of recommended dosing regimens as low as` 0.25-0.5 mg twice daily' ; it also suggests that` the maintenance dosage should be the lowest dosage which keeps the patient_symptom-free'
the apotex_label similarly recommends dosages of 0.25 mg to 0.5 mg administered twice daily and states that` [ o ] nce the desired clinical_effect is achieved consideration should be given to tapering to the lowest_effective_dose'
the district_court concluded that apotexs label induced infringement by suggesting the administration of the drug once a day
there is no reason to treat the similar recitation in the thorax_advertisement differently
the district_courts rationale for distinguishing between the apotex_label and the thorax_advertisement-that in 1994 the scientific community had yet to confirm that once-daily dosing was effective in large patient populations-does not undermine the effect of the advertisement in suggesting a reduction in dosage for particular patients which would necessarily be achieved either by reducing the amount administered on each occasion or the frequency of administration

*1067 because apotex has presented a substantial_question concerning the validity of the ¡¬603_patents method_claims i would vacate the preliminary_injunction

the dissent notes that after discussing the depot_effect the ¡¬ 603 patent states that` [ t ] his proposed mechanism of action is exemplary ; the invention is not limited by any particular_mechanism of action' ¡¬603_patent col.3 ll.11-12 and concludes that the testimony of dr._williams regarding the necessity of the depot_effect is therefore contrary to the specification
but no other` mechanism of action' is disclosed in the patent and the undisputed_testimony of dr._williams-the only expert_testimony provided to the court on this issue-is that after reading the ¡¬603_patent a person of skill in the art would have understood that the claimed invention simply would not work without the depot_effect
therefore this court sees no error in the district_courts construction as the evidence of record leaves no doubt that the claimed invention would be inoperable if the claims are construed in the manner suggested by apotex
see talbert fuel sys patents co. v. unocal corp. 275_f.3d_1371 1376 fed.cir.2002 vacated and remanded on other grounds 537_u.s._802 123_s.ct._70 154_l.ed.2d_3_(2002)` [ a ] construction that renders the claimed invention inoperable should be viewed with extreme skepticism'

by rearranging the language of the thorax_advertisement the dissent makes it appear that the advertisement and the proposed label both recommend administering a starting dose of 0.big_token__25_to_0__big_token5 mg twice daily followed by eventual reduction to the lowest_effective_dose
but the facts do not support that suggestion
the thorax_advertisement actually specifies higher levels of initial recommended twice daily dosing and then goes on to state that` [ t ] he maintenance_dose should be the lowest_dose which keeps the patient_symptom-free
recommended doses are.. 0.25-0.5 mg twice daily'
the thorax_advertisement thus recommends reducing a higher dose to the twice daily_dose of 0.25-0.5 mg not first administering 0.25-0.5 mg twice daily and then reducing the dosage to either once daily or twice daily_doses as suggested by the dissent
