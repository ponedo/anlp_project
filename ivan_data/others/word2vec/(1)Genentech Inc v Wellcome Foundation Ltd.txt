opinion
plager circuit_judge
the question in this patent infringement action is whether a protein formed through recombinant_dna_technology infringes under the doctrine of equivalents any of three patents a patent directed to a natural_protein extracted from certain human cancer cells ; a patent directed to the materials needed to produce the natural_protein through recombinant_dna_technology i.e. the dna_sequence encoding the protein the expression_vector containing the sequence and the microorganism or cell_culture capable of expressing the protein ; or a patent directed to the process of producing the natural_protein through recombinant_dna_technology
the united_states_district_court for the district of delaware found in favor of the patent owners/licensees and their agent plaintiffs genentech inc. genentech innovi_n.v. innovi and leuven_research & development_vzw leuven holding that the genetics_defendants to wit genetics_institute inc. institute and genetics manufacturing inc. gi_manufacturing infringed under the doctrine of equivalents u.s. patent nos._4752,603 the603_patent 4,766,075 the075_patent and 4,853,330 the330_patent
that judgment was entered by the court on april_6,_1990 in consolidated civil action nos._88-330 and 89-407 following a jury_trial and became final on july_15,_1992 when the court denied defendants motions for judgment as a matter of law jmol 1 or in the alternative a new_trial

we find that the judgment of the trial_court is not sustainable under the law and reverse

background
1
the protein tissue plasminogen activator t-pa plays an important role in the dissolution of fibrin_clots in the human_body
the body forms such clots typically to breach a rupture in a blood vessel
when they are no longer needed they are dissolved through the action of plasmin an enzyme which binds to the fibrin and severs the bonds between the fibrin molecules
since plasmin circulates through the blood in an inactive form called plasminogen a mechanism must be provided to activate the plasminogen and convert it to plasmin when a clot is targeted for dissolution by the body
the protein t-pa serves as that mechanism

unfortunately a pathological clot known as athrombus sometimes forms in intact vessels and causes life-threatening conditions
when a thrombus occurs the normal amount of t-pa circulating in the body may not be effective to produce plasmin fast enough to dissolve the clot and avoid the risk of heart muscle damage or death
an additional dosage of a material which activates the plasminogen is often necessary to dissolve the clot rapidly
several materials such as natural_t-pa extracted from human cells streptokinase or urokinase were known to perform *1558 this function although imperfectly either because in the case of streptokinase and urokinase of undesirable side effects and low affinity to fibrin and in the case of natural_t-pa the inability to derive clinically effective volumes from known sources

plaintiff leuven then set to work to find a way to produce natural_t-pa in a commercially useful way i.e. in sufficient quantities and at a sufficient level of purity and effectiveness to meet commercial demands
this task was assigned to three of leuvens scientists-drs
collen rijken and matsuo
they discovered that a commercially useful quantity and purity of natural_t-pa could be produced from human melanoma cell_cultures

this discovery is the subject of the603_patent the sole independent claim of which reads 1
human plasminogen activator having thrombolytic properties immunologically distinct from urokinase and having a specific_activity of about 500,000 iu/mg
using the who first_international_reference_preparation of t-pa tissue plasminogen activator as assay_standard or a specific_activity of about 90,000 iu/mg
using the who first_international_reference_preparation of urokinase as assay_standard

meanwhile plaintiff genentech set about pursuing the same objective a commercially useful process for producing natural_t-pa but by a different route-recombinant_dna_technology.2 that task was assigned to four genentech scientists-drs
goeddel kohr vehar and pennica
they ultimately discovered such a process as well as the intermediate_products used in the process i.e. the dna_sequence encoding human_t-pa the expression_vector containing that sequence and the microorganism or cell_culture capable of expressing human_t-pa using that vector

the intermediate_products are the subject of the claims of the075_patent of which claims 1 3 and 8 are representative 1
a dna_isolate consisting essentially of a dna_sequence encoding human_tissue_plasminogen_activator

* * * * * * 3
a recombinant expression_vector containing a dna_sequence encoding human_tissue_plasminogen_activator wherein the vector is capable of expressing human_tissue_plasminogen_activator in a transformed_microorganism or cell_culture

* * * * * * 8
a cell_culture capable of expressing human_tissue_plasminogen_activator obtained by transforming a mammalian cell line with a vector according to claim 3

the process itself is the subject of the claims of the330_patent of which claims 1 8 and 12 are representative 1
a process which comprises expressing a dna_sequence encoding human_tissue_plasminogen_activator in a recombinant_host_cell said recombinant_host_cell being a microorganism or cell_culture transformed with an expression_vector containing said dna_sequence

* * * * * * 8
a process for producing recombinant_human_tissue_plasminogen_activator_comprising a growing recombinant cells in a growth medium said cells being a microorganism or cell_culture transformed with an expression_vector containing dna encoding human_tissue_plasminogen_activator ; and
( b simultaneously expressing said dna thereby producing recombinant human_tissue_plasminogen_activator

* * * * * * 12
a process for producing recombinant_human_tissue_plasminogen_activator_comprising a transforming a microorganism or cell_culture with a replicable vector containing dna encoding human_tissue_plasminogen_activator ; and
*1559 b expressing said dna in said transformed_microorganism or cell_culture

the plaintiffs in this action consist of leuven the owner of the603_patent ; genentech the owner of the075 and330_patent s and the exclusive licensee of the603_patent ; and innovi leuvens agent to assist it in licensing its technology rights
they initiated this action on june_21,_1988 the day the603_patent issued alleging infringement of the603_patent and subsequently amended their complaint after the075_patent issued on august 23 1988 to allege infringement of that patent
when the330_patent issued on august 1 1989 plaintiffs initiated a separate action against defendants alleging infringement of that patent ; that action was subsequently consolidated with the other

the original defendants consisted of the genetics_defendants-institute and gi_manufacturing-as well as the wellcome_defendants-the wellcome_foundation_ltd. foundation ; wellcome biotechnology ltd. biotechnology ; burroughs_wellcome_co. burroughs ; bw_manufacturing inc. bw_manufacturing ; and welgen manufacturing inc. welgen3 gi_manufacturing is a wholly-owned subsidiary of institute
bw_manufacturing is a wholly-owned subsidiary of burroughs which in turn is a wholly-owned subsidiary of foundation
gi_manufacturing and bw_manufacturing jointly own welgen
that entity was at the time this action was initiated admittedly constructing a facility in the united_states for the commercial production of t-pa

according to plaintiffs allegations the genetics and wellcome_defendants acted in concert to make use and import into the united_states natural_t-pa or variants of natural_t-pa produced through recombinant_dna_technology that infringe the patents-in-suit
there are two accused products-met-t-pa and fe1x-both of which are structurally distinct from natural_t-pa.4 the genetics_defendants are alleged to have manufactured in the united_states the fe1x product for commercial_purposes
the wellcome_defendants are alleged to have manufactured in the united kingdom the met-t-pa_product and imported that product into the united_states for commercial_purposes

in response to plaintiffs allegations defendants denied infringement and asserted the affirmative defenses that the three patents-in-suit were invalid and unenforceable due to inequitable and fraudulent conduct during prosecution
defendants also asserted counterclaims alleging that plaintiffs procurement and enforcement of the three patents-in-suit against them constituted an antitrust violation and unfair_competition

the parties then filed cross-motions for summary_judgment on the infringement question in relation to the603 and075_patent_s. the330_patent was not the subject of those motions
shortly before trial was to commence on march_8,_1990 the court granted defendants motions in part
specifically it found that the accused products did not literally infringe the603 and075_patent_s but it reserved the doctrine of equivalents_issue for trial
genentech_inc. v. the wellcome_foundation_ltd. 14_uspq2d_1363 1990_wl_69187_(d.del.1990)
in concluding that defendants products did not literally infringe the603 and075_patent_s the court focused on the` human_plasminogen_activator' limitation recited in the603 claims *1560 and the` human_tissue_plasminogen_activator' limitation appearing in the075 claims
it interpreted these phrases to mean the full length amino_acid_sequence of human_t-pa plus any` naturally-occurring allelic variant' thereof
id.at 1369
since neither of the accused products contains the full length_sequence of natural_t-pa or any naturally-occurring variant thereof the court concluded they did not literally meet that limitation
id.at 1369-70

the court also focussed on the` specific_activity of about 500,000 iu/mg'
limitation recited in the603 claims
although that limitation is not expressly recited in the075 claims the court found it was implicit in those claims
id.at 1368
based on representations made to the united_states patent and trademark office pto during the603 prosecution the court interpreted that phrase to mean something` significantly above' a specific_activity of about 266,000 iu/mg. to distinguish the603 claims from prior_work of one of the603 inventors dr._rijken in which natural_t-pa with a specific_activity of 266,000 iu/mg
had been isolated
id.at 1368
it found that that limitation was likewise not literally met by either of the accused products fe1x because of plaintiffs failure to prove the specific_activity_level of that product and met-t-pa because the proven specific_activity_level was not` about 500,000 iu/mg`
id.at 1369-70

subsequently on march_15,_1990 the court commenced a jury_trial on the doctrine of equivalents_issue
after 15 days of testimony the trial_court instructed the jury
although the court issued general instructions on the issues of claim_construction the doctrine of equivalents and prosecution_history estoppel the court refused defendants request that the court instruct the jury on the construction and interpretation of the claims it had previously utilized in resolving the literal infringement issue

after deliberating for two hours and forty-eight minutes the jury returned special_verdicts finding that 1 the accused product manufactured by the wellcome_defendants-met-t-pa-infringed under the doctrine of equivalents the603 and330_patent s ; 2 the accused product manufactured by the genetics_defendants-fe1x-infringed under the doctrine of equivalents the603075 and330_patent s ; 5 and 3 all three patents were not proved invalid or unenforceable
in addition the jury determined that defendants had not shown plaintiffs committed antitrust violations or unfair_competition
on april_6,_1990 the court entered judgment in accordance with the jurys special_verdicts

on april_20,_1990 defendants filed their motions for jmol or in the alternative for a new_trial
some two years later in the decision that gave rise to this appeal the trial_court denied those motions
the genetics_defendants then filed this appeal
one of the wellcome_defendants-welgen the joint venture-also appealed ; however on october 22 1992 it dismissed its appeal with prejudice
none of the other wellcome_defendants appealed
while this appeal was pending the wellcome_defendants announced their intention to discontinue development of a t-pa_product
thus the issue of infringement by met-t-pa is not involved in this appeal
nor did plaintiffs/appellees cross-appeal the partial summary_judgment against them on the literal_infringement_question
the only issues now on appeal then are whether fe1x infringes one or more of the603075 or330_patent s under the doctrine of equivalents

discussion
the genetics_defendants_state three separate_grounds upon which they assert that the judgment of the trial_court should be reversed
first there was a lack of substantial_evidence showing that fe1x met under the doctrine of equivalents the specific_activity_limitation expressly recited in the603 claims and implicit in the claims of the other two patents-in-suit
second there was a failure to provide particularized testimony sufficient to support the equivalence finding in relation to the` human_tissue_plasminogen_activator' limitation recited in the075 and330 claims *1561 as required by malta v. schulmerich carillons inc. 952_f.2d_1320 21_uspq2d_1161_(fed.cir.1991) cert
denied 504_u.s._974 112_s.ct._2942 119_l.ed.2d_566_(1992)
third there was a complete absence of proof of any involvement by gi_manufacturing in infringing activity

in the alternative the genetics_defendants_state four separate_grounds upon which they assert they are entitled to a new_trial
first the jury was not provided sufficient guidance-including an instruction informing it of the construction and interpretation of the603 and075 claims the court had adopted in resolving on summary_judgment the literal_infringement_question in relation to those patents-with which to fairly resolve the doctrine of equivalents_issue
second the jury was not advised of the adverse consequences to defendants of a finding of infringement
third relevant portions of the prosecution_histories of the patents-in-suit-relating to the treatment received in the british courts by the british counterparts of the patents-in-suit-were improperly excluded
fourth the verdict is against the great weight of the evidence and would stifle research and development in the field of biotechnology

before addressing these points it is necessary to resolve three threshold issues of claim_construction or interpretation.6 first whether as the genetics_defendants assert the specific_activity_limitation appearing in the603 claims is implicit in the075 and330 claims
second whether as the genetics_defendants further assert the 500,000 figure appearing as part of that limitation means 500,000 iu/mg
as measured using the bovine_fibrin_plate_assay
third what is the literal meaning of the phrase` human_tissue_plasminogen_activator' appearing in the075 and330 claims
these issues are issues of law-they are classic issues of claim_construction that is what do the claims mean
see north american vaccine v. american_cyanamid_co. 7_f.3d_1571 1575 28_uspq2d_1333 1336 fed.cir.1993 cert

they are for the court to decide and explicate on the record
see read corp. v. portec inc. 970_f.2d_816 822 23_uspq2d_1426 1432 fed.cir.1992
since the trial_court did not instruct the jury on these issues and did not appear to have utilized its prior claim interpretation in ruling on the motions for jmol it is necessary for us to resolve these issues now in ruling on the courts denial of genetics motions for jmol
id.at 822-23 23 uspq2d at 1432
we address each of these threshold points in order

3
claim construction
a
the specific_activity_limitation
we begin with the question of whether as the genetics_defendants assert the specific_activity_limitation appearing in the603 claims is implicit in the075 and330 claims

the genetics_defendants first assert that plaintiffs/appellees are precluded from arguing that the limitation is not implicit in those claims due to plaintiffs failure to appeal the district_courts grant of summary_judgment by filing a cross-appeal to the present appeal
as noted previously in that decision the trial_court determined that the limitation was implicit in the075 claims
thus according to the genetics_defendants that determination is` law of the case
`` 7

*1562 we disagree
`` the general rule is that without taking a cross-appeal the prevailing party may present any argument that supports the judgment in its favor'

204.11 [ 3 ] at 4-47 2d ed
1993
here were we to adopt a claim_construction more favorable to plaintiffs case than the construction adopted by the district_court on summary_judgment that would have no different result than affirmance of the trial_courts april_6,_1990 judgment
accordingly plaintiffs are not precluded from arguing a construction in support of the judgment that is different from that announced by the trial_court

in any event the genetics_defendants argue the specific_activity_limitation appearing in the603 claims is inherent in the phrase` human_tissue_plasminogen_activator' appearing in the075 and330 claims
again we disagree
assuming for the sake of argument that the phrase` human_tissue_plasminogen_activator' is ambiguous there is no basis in the330 and075 specifications and prosecution_histories for reading a specific_activity_limitation into the phrase
the only_evidence identified by the genetics_defendants as a plausible basis for doing so is the603 specification and prosecution_history
however that patent is completely unrelated to the330 and075_patent_s. it was prosecuted by a different entity than the others
the underlying research was conducted by different individuals than the research underlying the others
and finally while the specific_activity concept is a definition of purity critical to the patentability of the603 claims-it is the critical_distinction of those claims over the less purified materials constituting the relevant prior_art8-the same can not be said of the330 and075 claims in which other limitations serve to distinguish the claimed subject_matter over the prior_art
thus that documentation can not serve as the basis for reading the limitation into the phrase
we conclude that the330 and075_patent_s contain no implied specific_activity_limitation
the avoidance of this limitation by fe1x thus can not provide the basis for a finding of non-infringement under the doctrine of equivalents in relation to these patents

b
the meaning of` 500,000 iu/mg'
the next question to resolve is the meaning of the numerical figure` 500,000 iu/mg'
appearing as part of the specific_activity_limitation of the603 claims
the genetics_defendants argue that the figure means 500,000 iu/mg
as measured using a bovine_fibrin_plate_assay
the plaintiffs by contrast argue that the figure is not limited to any specific_assay_type

we agree with the genetics_defendants
according to the prior_art of record the numerical measurement of specific_activity of t-pa can vary by more than a factor of three depending on the specific assay used.9 thus in order for the 500,000 figure to serve its intended purpose of distinguishing over the prior_art_value of 266,000 iu/mg. it is necessary to assign that figure a specific_assay_type
since the claim is silent on this point10 we must look elsewhere for the answer
see hormone research found
v. genentech inc. 904_f.2d_1558 1562 15_uspq2d_1039 1043 fed.cir.1990 cert
dismissed 499_u.s._955 111_s.ct._1434 113_l.ed.2d_485_(1991)

the603 prosecution_history reveals that the 500,000 figure was added to the603 claims during prosecution to distinguish over prior_work of dr._rijkens
that work had resulted in a specific_activity of 48,000 iu/mg. when expressed in terms of the prevailing urokinase_standard and 266,000 iu/mg. when expressed in terms of the new and *1563 preferred t-pa standard that had evolved after the603 filing date.11

the specific_activity of the claimed product was initially only available in terms of the urokinase_standard
when so expressed the figure was 90,000 iu/mg
dr._collen was assigned the task of expressing the figure in terms of the new standard
that work resulted in the 500,000 figure
an article contained in the603 prosecution_history shows that this figure was determined using` bovine fibrin films' i.e. a bovine_fibrin_plate_assay.12 apparently that assay was used so that the figure would be compatible with dr._rijkens prior_work in which specific_activity was measured using the bovine_fibrin_plate_assay13 and with the work which gave rise to the filing of the603_patent in which specific_activity was likewise measured using the bovine_fibrin_plate_assay
col._5,_ll._1-6
accordingly we conclude that the 500,000 figure means iu/mg
as measured using the bovine_fibrin_plate_assay

c. the definition of` human_tissue_plasminogen_activator' we next address the question of the meaning of the phrase` human_tissue_plasminogen_activator' appearing in the075 and330 claims
since a definition of that phrase can not be extracted from the claims themselves we look to the specification14 for guidance
see mcgill inc. v. john zink co. 736_f.2d_666 674 221_uspq_944 949 fed.cir.1984 cert
denied 469_u.s._1037 105_s.ct._514 83_l.ed.2d_404_(1984)

a problem now arises because there are at least four possible definitions of the phrase set forth in the specification.15 first there is a narrow structural definition t-pa produced through recombinant_dna_technology but having the same structure as natural_t-pa.16 second there is a broader_structural_definition all products containing the` essential' 17 kringle region and the serine protease region.18 third there is an even *1564 broader_structural_definition all products containing just the enzymatically active_portion i.e. the serine protease portion.19 fourth there is a functional_definition` [ i ] t is capable of catalyzing the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin binds to fibrin and is classified as a t-pa based on immunological properties as set forth hereinabove'
col._6,_ll._15-19

these diverse definitions reflect either inartful drafting a conscious attempt to create ambiguity about the scope of the claims or a desire to claim a wide variety of materials not described or enabled in the specification
for example it appears that some of the products contained within the third definition will not be capable of binding to fibrin because they lack the regions which have been identified as playing a role in the fibrin binding process.20 yet the fourth definition identifies fibrin binding as an essential functional attribute of human_t-pa

an appropriate_method for resolving the issue is to avoid those definitions upon which the pto could not reasonably have relied when it issued the patent
that is an appropriate_method to follow because it avoids the possibility of an applicant obtaining in court a scope of protection which encompasses subject_matter that through the conscious efforts of the applicant the pto did not examine.21 an applicant should not be able deliberately to narrow the scope of examination to avoid during prosecution scrutiny by the pto of subject_matter with the objective of more quickly obtaining a patent or avoiding the risk of an estoppel and then obtain in court either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents a scope of protection which encompasses that subject_matter
see north_american_vaccine_inc. 7 f.3d at 1577 28 uspq2d at 1337

under this approach the first definition is the appropriate_one to adopt because of the four it is the most consistent with the limited form in which the claims are drafted22 and the others are hopelessly overbroad
as dr._goeddel testified an infinite number of permutations of natural_t-pa are covered by these other_definitions
many of these permutations would not be capable of binding to fibrin and would thus be inoperative
there is no basis provided in the specification for determining which of these permutations are operative and which are not
the point is supported by dr._larsens testimony to the effect that the properties of these permutations were` totally unpredictable'
genentech acknowledged this point in two international_patent_applications it filed directed to the structural features which define fe1x in relation to natural_t-pa.23 the determination of which permutations are operative would thus require an undue amount of experimentation.24 thus we are unwilling to *1565 say that the specification satisfies the enablement requirement of 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
1 1988 with respect to these broader definitions25 or that the pto could have relied on these definitions in issuing the patent

plaintiffs argue that a protein 25e10 discussed in the specification provides a basis for interpreting the phrase` human_tissue_plasminogen_activator' appearing in the claims broadly on the theory that claims are to be interpreted in light of the disclosure of examples in the specification
see smithkline diagnostics inc. v. helena laboratories corp. 859_f.2d_878 8_uspq2d_1468_(fed.cir.1988)
the difficulty with that argument is that 25e10 is not natural_t-pa and its disclosure therefore does not aid in interpreting the claims.26

we conclude therefore that the phrase` human_tissue_plasminogen_activator' appearing in the075 and330 claims means natural_t-pa.27

4
the jury_findings regarding the specific activity limitation
having completed our resolution of the three threshold claim interpretation questions we consider in order the points raised by the genetics_defendants keeping in mind our standard of review whether the jurys express or implied findings of fact are supported by substantial_evidence
see read 970 f.2d at 821 23 uspq2d at 1431
we begin with the question of whether the jurys implied_conclusion-that the specific_activity_limitation appearing in the603 claims was met by fe1x either literally or equivalently-is supported by substantial_evidence.28 we conclude that it is not

as we have said` substantial_evidence is more than a mere scintilla
it means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion'

plaintiffs point to the following three pieces of evidence 1 dr._larsens testimony that the specific_activity of fe1x is in the range from 350 000_to_450000 iu/mg. 2 statements in an internal institute document to the effect that the specific_activity of fe1x is` similar' to that of natural_t-pa29 and 3 a publication_co-authored by dr._collen stating that *1566 the specific_activity of fe1x is 440,000 iu/mg.30

to begin with the specific_activity measurements reported by dr._larsen were made using the chromogenic_substrate_assay and there is no evidence that measurements made using this assay are comparable to those made using the bovine_fibrin_plate_assay
in fact all the evidence of record addressing this subject indicates that the two methods are not comparable

youre really talking about two totally different assays

a so its apples and oranges
you can not compare the two numbers.. q i understand
and at your deposition when you were asked about the specific_activity for fe1x was measured against the international t-pa you said it ranged from 350 000_to_450000 ius per milligram ?
a using a chromogenic_substrate_assay and not the fibrin plate assay which appears to be the standard for measuring plasminogen activator activity with respect to these patent disputes
so it is completely distinct from anything that appears to be relevant to me in this trial
plaintiffs assert that a publication_co-authored by dr._larsen shows that results obtained using the chromogenic_assay are comparable to those obtained using the bovine assay.31 we can not agree
although that document presents results obtained using the two methods it hardly establishes that the two methods are comparable
in fact it implies just the opposite
the two figures reported for fe1x are very different 334 ¡Ó 45 units/ug
for the chromogenic_assay and 440 units/ug
for the bovine_fibrin_plate_assay

likewise the statements in the internal institute report do not provide the necessary support
first they are qualitative whereas the necessary comparison is quantitative
second they are based on a synthetic assay which unlike the bovine_fibrin_plate_assay does not measure the ability to dissolve clots

finally the 440,000 figure reported in the publication_co-authored by dr._collen was measured from material prepared by leuven ; it is not clear what relationship that material bears to the accused product that is the subject of this lawsuit
dr._collens testimony on this precise point was equivocal
when asked whether this material was the same substance as the accused product he merely said the` description' was the same
moreover other measurements reported in that publication and taken in the same manner fall outside the range of permissible scientific error and thus bring into question all the measurements reported.32

the only_evidence in the record which is probative on the question of the specific_activity of fe1x is the testimony of plaintiffs expert dr. mann
according to that testimony the specific_activity of fe1x using the bovine_fibrin_plate_assay is 253,800 iu/mg
plus or minus 18 % i.e. 208 116_to_299484
that is significantly closer to the prior_art_value of 266,000 than it is to the claimed range33 and may even be less than that *1567 value34
fe1x is thus outside the permissible range of equivalents through the application of prosecution_history estoppel.35 no reasonable_jury could have concluded otherwise
the trial_court thus erred in denying the genetics_defendants motions for jmol in relation to the603_patent under the doctrine of equivalents

5
the jury_findings regarding the human tissue plasminogen_activator limitation
we next consider whether there is evidence in the record sufficient to support the jurys implied_conclusion that the` human_tissue_plasminogen_activator' limitation appearing in the075 and330 claims is met by fe1x.36 fe1x does not literally meet the limitation-it is not natural_t-pa
thus the question is whether the evidence supports a finding that this limitation is met by an equivalent element of fe1x under the doctrine of equivalents

to support such a finding the evidence must be sufficiently particularized to meet the three prong test of equivalency enunciated in graver_tank & mfg co. v. linde air products co. 339_u.s._605 608 70_s.ct._854 856 94_l.ed._1097 reh g denied 340_u.s._845 71_s.ct._12 95_l.ed._620_(1950) requiring a showing of substantial identity of function way and result
malta 952 f.2d at 1327 21 uspq2d at 1166 ; lear siegler inc. v. sealy mattress co. 873_f.2d_1422 1425-26 10_uspq2d_1767 1770 fed.cir.1989
if any one of the prongs is unsupported the finding of equivalency can not stand

at the outset we are confronted with a problem the issue of whether theway orresult prongs are met is highly dependent upon how broadly one defines the` function' of human_t-pa
if as the trial_court thought a broad_definition is appropriate-stimulating` the dissolution of fibrin_clots through the cleavage of plasminogen to plasmin' 37-then it is difficult to imagine how fe1x or any version of t-pa for that matter would avoid infringement under the doctrine of equivalents because t-pa or any operative variant would by definition necessarily perform this function in the same general way with the same general results
however if the definition of t-pa set forth in the specification is adopted-catalyzing the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin [ and ] bind [ ing ] to fibrin38-then the equivalence question becomes a much closer one

the operative definition for purposes of equivalency_analysis is the intended function as seen in the context of the patent the prosecution_history and the prior_art
graver_tank 339 u.s. at 609 70 s.ct.at 856 ; zenith lab inc. v. bristol-myers squibb co. 19_f.3d_1418 1425 30_uspq2d_1285 1291 fed.cir.1994
based on our review of these materials we conclude that no reasonable_jury could have adopted the broad_definition suggested by the trial_court
as noted the specification expressly defines fibrin binding as a critical component of the` function' of human_t-pa. col._6,_ll._16-19
other evidence confirms this
according to a british patent application filed by foundation it is critical in a therapeutic sense-it reduces the risk of hemorrhaging.39 moreover as drs
goeddel and collen testified the fibrin binding affinity of human_t-pa is a critical_distinction between this protein and the two prior plasminogen activators urokinase and streptokinase
thus a functional_definition of t-pa which ignores this distinction *1568 would result in a range of equivalents which impermissably reads on the prior_art.40 see zenith lab. 19 f.3d at 1425 30 uspq2d at 1291_n._9

we conclude that the` function' of human_t-pa for purposes of the equivalency_analysis includes fibrin binding and no reasonable_jury could have concluded otherwise
in light of this definition we find that the record is devoid of any particularized evidence or linking argument showing that fe1x functions in substantially the same_way as human_t-pa or achieves substantially the same results.41

plaintiffs point to the testimony of several witnesses to the effect that the kringle 2 k2 region of amino_acids is present in both fe1x and human_t-pa and that this region plays a role in the ability of both to bind to fibrin
dr._larsen testified q and fe1x binds the fibrin does n't it ?
a weakly
q but it binds the fibrin ?
a weakly
q weakly
and it binds the fibrin through the second kringle region does n't it ?
a i do n't know
q you do n't know how it binds the fibrin ?
a i mean that is speculation in the literature but there are conflicting reports to that point
q but there are literature reports that suggest that the finger region is involved in the binding to fibrin as well as the kringle two region ; is n't that correct ?
a that is what is generally believed yes
q and natural_t-pa also binds to fibrin through kringle two does n't it ?
a assuming that its kringle two yes
dr. wetalufer testified q does gis fe1x bind to fibrin ?
a gis bind to fibrin ?
i think it does but in a weaker_way than the full-length material
q binds in a weaker_way ?
a yes
q in your view does it bind to fibrin in a completely different way than the full-length human_t-pa ?
a no
clearly there are common elements in the binding of the two t-pas

dr._larsens testimony is speculative and dr. wetlaufers testimony is tentative and conclusory
even assuming that the k2_region does play a role in the binding_function of both that hardly establishes that the two bind to fibrin in substantially the same_way with substantially the same results particularly in view of the overwhelming and undisputed_evidence that the two possess dramatically different_properties and structure

first there is the undisputed testimony of drs
collen and larsen that the fibrin binding affinity of fe1x is less than half i.e. about 40 % of that of human_t-pa as a consequence of the deletion of the e and f regions in fe1x

second there is undisputed_evidence showing that the amino_acid_substitution at position 117 of the k1_region eliminates a glycosylation site and thus prevents a carbohydrate_side_chain from being attached to the protein during post-translational modifications by the host mammalian cell
according to dr._larsen the deletion of the f and e_regions standing alone would result in a protein that would be therapeutically ineffective in that it would be incapable of binding to fibrin at all ; preventing the attachment of *1569 the carbohydrate_side_chain increases the binding affinity of fe1x sufficiently to make it therapeutically effective
thus the mode of binding is hardly substantially the same

third there is the undisputed_evidence that fe1x behaves significantly differently than human_t-pa in the human_body
it has a half-life42 about ten times that of natural_t-pa and it has a significantly decreased affinity for binding to endothelial cells43 in relation to human_t-pa. genentech acknowledged the significance of these advantages in the two international_patent_applications noted earlier in this opinion.44 thus the results achieved are hardly substantially the same

we are mindful that the state of the science in this area of endeavor is very imprecise.45 thus it would be inappropriate to interpret malta as requiring plaintiffs/appellees to prove the specific mechanism by which fe1x binds to fibrin or to prove that the different_properties and structure exhibited by fe1x bear no relation to the binding_function
our only point is that the showing that the k2_region plays a role in the binding_function of each is insufficient particularly in view of the profound differences in the properties and structure possessed by each

for all the foregoing_reasons we conclude the trial_court erred in denying the genetics_defendants motion for jmol in relation to the075 and330_patent s under the doctrine of equivalents.46

summary
the trial judge should have granted jmol in favor of the genetics_defendants on the doctrine of equivalents findings by the jury because

1
the specific_activity_limitation appearing in the603 claims means specific_activity as measured using the bovine_fibrin_plate_assay

2
considering the603 prosecution_history the specific_activity of fe1x does not as a matter of law meet the specific_activity_limitation appearing in the603 claims under the doctrine of equivalents

3
the human_tissue_plasminogen_activator_limitation appearing in the075 and330 claims means natural_t-pa
the jurys implied_conclusion that fe1x meets the human_tissue_plasminogen_activator_limitation appearing in the075 and330 claims under the doctrine of equivalents is not supported by substantial_evidence

conclusion
for all the foregoing_reasons we reverse.47

reversed

*1570 lourie circuit_judge concurring
i join the opinion of the majority but i would adopt a different means to interpret the expression` human_tissue_plasminogen_activator' t-pa
moreover i wish to point out an additional reason why i believe that the accused fe1x can not infringe a claim to t-pa under the doctrine of equivalents

the independent claims at issue in the075 and330 recombinant patents contain no definition for the dna_isolate other than that it encodes human_t-pa
such a claim defining a substance only by its function encompassing all substances that accomplish that result is akin to a single means claim which might fail to satisfy the definiteness requirement of 35 u.s.c.¡± 112
see fiers v. sugano 984_f.2d_1164 1171 25_uspq2d_1601 1606 fed.cir.1993
such a claim avoids that problem only when the term` human_tissue_plasminogen_activator' has definitive meaning when it describes a specific_compound
that term is in fact definite as it is well established that human_t-pa is a protein consisting of 527 amino_acids
thus all the claims which depend upon a definition of human_t-pa are limited to that specific_compound and any other compounds considered under law as equivalent thereto
* the trial_court of course held that there was no literal infringement

under the doctrine of equivalents an accused compound can be held to infringe if inter alia it represents only an insubstantial_change from the claimed compound
see graver_tank & mfg co. v. linde air prods co. 339_u.s._605 607 610 70_s.ct._854 855 857 94_l.ed._1097 1950
the accused compound in this case consists of a protein that contains 446 amino_acids 15 % fewer than the t-pa referred to in the claims
this is not an insubstantial_change but a substantial one
moreover it has ten times the half-life of natural_t-pa
the t-pa recited in the claims was not copied since the accused fe1x is a very different material independently invented and developed requiring an estimated 130 man-years and costing $ 20 million
if claims are to have any meaning as a matter of law such a substance can not be held to be infringing

thus this case illustrates the problem that results not only when a court fails to construe the claims for the jury but also when the fact-finder unduly focuses only on the function way result analysis of graver_tank 339 u.s. at 608 70 s.ct.at 856
these limited means of analysis fail to fully elucidate the issue especially when the patented material is a chemical as it is here
is the increased half-life part of the` way' analysis or is it a different` result' ?
is the binding to fibrin` function' as stated by the majority or is it part of the` way' t-pa dissolves clots ?
these questions illustrate the shortcomings of the function way result tests which relate to` how' a substance works i.e. what it does rather than what it is which claims purport to define
the other aspects of graver_tank if properly considered by the fact-finder would have led to a sounder result
the substantiality of the difference between the accused and claimed compounds the fact of independent development and the lack of copying all lead to a conclusion of lack of infringement

the amino_acid_sequence of natural_t-pa consists of five separate domains or regions each having different functional attributes the finger f region the epidermal_growth e region the kringle 1 k1 region the kringle 2 k2 region and the serine protease p region
the amino_acid_sequence of met-t-pa is the same length as that of natural_t-pa but differs from that sequence through an amino_acid_substitution at position 245 of the k2_region where methionine is substituted for valine
the fe1x protein takes its name from the fact that it lacks the finger f region and most of the epidermal_growth e region of natural_t-pa and eliminates one of the carbohydrate chains by altering the gene at position 117 of the k1_region where glutamine is substituted for arginine thereby changing the glycosylation pattern 1x
it also has a different amino acid at position 245 the same substitution as met-t-pa

that seems to be the case here in view of the narrow form in which the claims are drafted and the failure to incorporate into the claims any of the broader concepts discussed in the specification

we see no inconsistency between this conclusion and the rule that the pto should give claims their broadest reasonable interpretation during prosecution

the point is supported by unrebutted testimony to the effect that the genetics_defendants expended a significant amount of effort- $ 20 million and 130 man-years-to develop fe1x notwithstanding the prior_work that led to the filing of the075 and330_patent s. 25
there may also be a problem with satisfaction of the definiteness and description requirements of 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 in relation to these other_definitions especially the fourth functional_definition
the dna_isolate which is the subject of the075 and330 claims is itself defined in functional_terms i.e. as any sequence that encodes human_t-pa. a conclusion that the phrase` human_tissue_plasminogen_activator' is also defined in functional_terms would give rise to a definiteness problem because a competitor could not then reasonably determine what dna_sequences are within the scope of the claims and which are not
it would also give rise to a problem with the description requirement because the specification does not even remotely describe all the dna_sequences that encode the proteins within the scope of the functional_definition

the record establishes that 25e10 differs in significant characteristics from natural_t-pa the inventors testimony to the contrary notwithstanding
27
it is undisputed that fe1x is not a naturally occurring variant of the full-length_sequence of human_t-pa
thus unlike the district_court we do not reach the issue of whether the phrase` human_tissue_plasminogen_activator' as it appears in the claims includes within its scope naturally-occurring variants of the full-length_sequence

the jury was properly instructed that to find infringement under the doctrine of equivalents they had to find that each limitation of the claim was met by the accused product either literally or by an equivalent

for example a value of 640,000 iu/mg
is reported for the specific_activity of native_t-pa
but dr._collen testified that the` consensus attitude' of those who work in the area is that if an assay is performed` properly and carefully' the resulting measurement for native_t-pa should be 500,000 plus or minus 25 % i.e. between 375 000_and_625000 and that a value above that range was not achievable in nature
the implication is that the reported figures including the 440,000 figure were all biased upwards due to the presence of a unknown factor which affected all
33
the upper limit of the testified-to range 299,484 is significantly closer to the prior_art_value of 266,000 than it is to the lower limit of` about 500,000' i.e
375,000 as determined in accordance with dr._collens testimony
as dr. mann put it the difference between the specific_activity of fe1x and the claimed range is` outside the range of quibbles'

in view of our conclusion regarding the specific_activity_limitation in the603 claims we do not need to determine whether there is substantial_evidence in the record to support the jurys implied_conclusion that fe1x met the` human_plasminogen_activator' limitation appearing in the603 claims

the jury was properly instructed that the scope of equivalents imparted to a claim can not be so broad as to cover that which the prior_art discloses

another problem faced by plaintiffs/appellees is that the doctrine of equivalents is not available for the attainment in court of a scope of protection which encompasses subject_matter deliberately removed from examination by the pto during prosecution through narrow claiming
this is a reflection of the rule enunciated in perkin-elmer corp. v. westinghouse electric corp. 822_f.2d_1528 3_uspq2d_1321_(fed.cir.1987) that it is impermissible to erase under the doctrine of equivalents` meaningful limitations of the claim on which the public is entitled to rely in avoiding infringement'

the` half-life' is a measurement of the length of time a dosage is retained in the human_body
according to dr. marders and dr._collens testimony the long half-life of fe1x in relation to human_t-pa-about 40 minutes for fe1x versus about 4 minutes for human_t-pa-is a significant_advantage because it avoids the need for continuous administration over a prolonged period in order to remove a clot
43
`` endothelial' cells are the cells that make up the lining of blood vessels
the reduced binding affinity to endothelial cells is likewise a significant_advantage because it reduces the risk of uncontrolled bleeding that is present with the administration of human_t-pa. 44

in view of our disposition of the doctrine of equivalents question on the basis of the function/way/result test we need not reach the alternative basis for resolving that question discussed in the concurrence

47
in view of our disposition of this appeal we need not reach the points made by the genetics_defendants relating to a new_trial or the binding effect of the judgment in relation to gi_manufacturing
we only observe that as we have discussed the trial_court erred in undertaking the task of claim_construction and then failing to instruct the jury on the proper claim_construction it was to apply
while that would be sufficient grounds to remand for a new_trial in view of our disposition of this appeal no remand is warranted
