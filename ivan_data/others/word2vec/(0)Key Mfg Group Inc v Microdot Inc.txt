this court reverses

background
both key and microdot manufacture capped wheel_nuts used to attach a wheel to a car axle
the wheel_nuts have several sides or` wrench_flats' to permit a tool to grasp the nut for tightening or loosening
the nut_body has two faces
the nut face in direct_contact with the wheel is the` wheel face'
the opposite or exterior face is the` cap_face'

the961_patent discloses and claims a decorative_nut and stainless_steel_cap for attachment to the nut_body
the stainless_steel_cap has sides corresponding to the wrench_flats
welds secure the decorative_cap to the cap_face of the nut_body
claim 1 of the961_patent reads as follows 1
a decorative_nut for holding a wheel on a motor vehicle and exposed to view on the wheel said nut having a central threaded aperture polygonal_sides a first_end adapted to engage a wheel a second_end opposite said first_end and having an end_face extending at right_angles to the axis of the nut and a sheet metal cap for the nut and having a section extending over the polygonal_sides of the nut and an end_section adapted to cover the second_end of the nut said section extending over the polygonal_nut_sides including a plurality of cap_wrench_flats respectively associated with and oppositely facing said polygonal_nut_sides said cap_wrench_flats and said polygonal_nut_sides being disposed between said first and second_ends of said nut said end_section being connected to the section of the cap which covers the polygonal_nut_sides by a section formed fully around the perimeter of the cap and having an extension at right_angles to the axis of the nut so as to be parallel to said end_face such connecting section being in juxtaposed contact throughout a substantial_area with and welded to said end_face the position of welded contact between the connecting section and the end_face resulting in shear_forces being applied to the weld in response to the application of forces on the capped wrench_flats which create moments about the central axis of the nut
( emphasis added
the highlighted portion constitutes the disputed` at right_angles' and` substantial_area' claim language
the invention is illustrated in the961_patent in part as follows

*1446. ?
?
?
*1447 microdots nut is similar in many respects to the961 disclosed nut
it differs however in significant particulars
the961 claims require` an extension' of the decorative_cap` at right_angles to the axis of the nut so as to be parallel to said end_face'
the cap_face of microdots nut_body and the cap itself have a fifteen degree outward taper
key does not dispute this fact
key asserts however that no technologically significant difference exists between microdots fifteen degree_taper and keys zero degree interface

another difference is the area of contact between the decorative_cap and the nut
the961 claims require` contact throughout a substantial_area'
microdot argues that its cap is not in contact with the nut over a substantial_area

in 1987 key sued microdot for infringement of the961_patent
after a bench trial the district_court upheld the validity of the961_patent
the district_court also concluded that the reexamined claims as amended and the original claims were identical within the meaning of 35 u.s.c.¡±¡± 252 307 b 1982
finally the district_court concluded that microdots nuts literally infringed the961 claims
key_mfg group inc. v. microdot inc. 679_f.supp._648 4_uspq2d_1687_(e.d.mich.1987)
the district_court found literal_infringement despite its conclusion that` [ t ] he microdot capped wheel_nuts differ [ ] from those of key'
id.at 660 4 uspq2d at 1697

on appeal from that judgment this court affirmed the validity holding but vacated the infringement judgment
the district_court had ignored some claim_limitations
this court stated that` [ a ] ll claim_limitations are significant and must be considered' in an infringement analysis
under the doctrine of equivalents as well` claim_limitations can not be ignored andthe plaintiff must show the presence of every element or its substantial_equivalent in the accused device
`` key_mfg group inc. v. microdot inc. 854_f.2d_1328 fed.cir.1988 table opinion available on westlaw citing lemelson v. united states 752_f.2d_1538 1551 224_uspq_526 533 fed.cir.1985
this court remanded for the district_court to` provide sufficient factual findings on infringement to enable a meaningful review of the merits of its judgment'
id

on remand the district_court addressed the claim_limitations of` substantial_area' and` at right_angles to the axis of the nut'
key_mfg group inc. v. microdot inc. 15_uspq2d_1195_(e.d.mich.1990)
the district_court determined that the` substantial_area' limitation is met by a weld` sufficient to hold the cap and nut together in response to shear_forces applied during the loosening or tightening of the wheel nut'
id.at 1199
the` right_angles' limitation is met if` at least a portion of the weld' is at right_angles to the axis of the nut
id.at 1200

the trial_court thus concluded that microdots wheel_caps infringed the961 claims literally and under the doctrine of equivalents
with respect to` substantial_area' the trial_court opined that microdots wheel_caps use welds with enough strength to resist shearing
id.at 1201
further the district_court found that at least a portion of the weld was at right_angles to the axis of the nut
thus according to the trial_court microdot literally infringed the961 claims
id.at 1202

the district_court concluded that the microdot_nuts also infringe under the doctrine of equivalents
the court opined that the` substantial_area' language describes the function of holding the nut and cap together
thus the trial_court decided that any contact area is equivalent` as long as the weld is placed in shear during the application of wrenching forces and retains the cap and nut together as the patent teaches'
id.at 1203
the district_court determined that key added the` at right_angles' language during prosecution merely to` clarify the location of the weld on the nut_body and in contrast to the wrench_flats' rather than to distinguish prior_art
id
thus even though microdots nut included *1448 a taper the district_court granted key` a range of equivalents which includes a fifteen degree_taper..' id.at 1204

discussion
claim interpretation
the district_court erred in interpreting claim 1
before analyzing a claim to determine whether infringement occurs the court must properly interpret the claim
improper claim construction can distort the entire infringement analysis
bausch & lomb inc. v. barnes-hind/hydrocurve inc. 796_f.2d_443 450 230_uspq_416 421 fed.cir.1986 cert
denied 484_u.s._823 108_s.ct._85 98_l.ed.2d_47_(1987)
claim interpretation is a question of law
moleculon research corp. v. cbs inc. 793_f.2d_1261 1270 229_uspq_805 811 fed.cir.1986 cert
denied 479_u.s._1030 107_s.ct._875 93_l.ed.2d_829_(1987)
while a factual dispute over the meaning of terms in a claim may arise in this case there is no assertion that the words on which the issue of infringement turns have anything other than their common ordinary meaning
see howes v. medical components inc. 814_f.2d_638 643 2_uspq2d_1271 1273 fed.cir.1987
thus in the absence of a factual issue proper interpretation of claim 1 is a question of law freely reviewable by this court on appeal
see durango assocs inc. v. reflange inc. 843_f.2d_1349 1356 6_uspq2d_1290 1295 fed.cir.1988

the district_courts interpretation of claim 1 conflicts with the claims straightforward language as supported by the specification and file history
further its construction of claim 1 erased all the limitations which distinguished the961 structure from the prior_art
claim 1 expressly requires the decorative_cap to come into contact with the cap_face of the nut_body at right_angles to the nuts axis
the district_court found that microdots nut has a 15-degree_taper on both the cap_face and the cap itself
the district_court can not disregard this difference between microdots nut and the961 claims

key suggests that it added the right angle limitation during prosecution to distinguish the cap_end_face from the wrench_flats
to the contrary the prosecution history shows that key added the limitation to distinguish the structure of the961_patent from the prior_art
the added limitation also describes the flat unyielding projection-free face-to-face contact which defines the substantial_area limitation

the district_court erred in concluding that the prior_art patents` illustrate a cap end of the nut_body at right_angles to the axis of the nut'
this prior_art does not disclose a right angle configuration of both the cap_section and cap_face
rather it shows a tapered cap_face and cap_section
the` right_angles' language distinguished the shape of keys nut_body and cap from prior_art
key argued during prosecution that the language added` significant structural distinctions over the references to more clearly define over the prior_art of record'

the district_court concluded that` at right_angles' means a weld partly at right_angles
in reaching this conclusion the trial_court misread the patent claims
the claims refer to the structure of the cap and the cap_face-not the weld
thus the` right_angles' limitation refers to the relationship between these parts and the nut_body
the cap_section and the cap_face must be` at right_angles' to the axis of the nut_body
the weld joins the cap_face and cap_section but the claim specifies no angular relationship applicable to the weld

the trial_court further erred in reading the` substantial_area' limitation
according to the district_court any weld strong enough to keep the cap and nut_body together under shear_forces satisfies the limitation
the` right_angles' and` substantial_area' limitations define the structure of the nut_body and cap
they further define the position relationship and amount of direct_contact between the cap and the nut
these limitations do not however refer to the location and strength of the weld on the cap_end_face

infringement
claim 1 of the961_patent requires alignment of both the cap_face of the nut and the cap itself` at right_angles *1449 to the axis of the nut'
this language limits the claim
to support an infringement determination an accused device must embody exactly each claim limitation or its equivalent
julien v. zeringue 864_f.2d_1569 1571 9_uspq2d_1552 1553 fed.cir.1989
microdots nut features a fifteen degree_taper on the cap_face of the nut_body and on the cap
this difference precludes literal_infringement
because microdots cap is not at right_angles to the axis of the nut it does not literally infringe claim 1

claim 1 also requires the nut_bodys cap_face and the cap_end_section to be in contact over a substantial_area
microdot connects the cap to the nut_body with a continuous thin ring projection or a series of welding point projections
these points partially collapse upon welding and essentially keep the parts separated
only these welding points connect the microdot_nut_body and cap
contact at discrete points is hardly contact over a substantial_area
the district_courts finding that the` substantial_area' limitation is met by any weld capable of resisting shear_forces is clearly erroneous
for this reason as well microdot does not literally infringe the961 claims

key added the` right_angles' and` substantial_area' limitations to the961 claims to overcome prior_art rejections
this court may not ignore these limitations in determining whether the accused microdot_nuts infringe
microdots fifteen degree_taper and lack of direct_contact between the nut_body and cap_end_section over a substantial_area differ from the961 claims
these differences preclude a finding of literal_infringement

the microdot structure also does not infringe under the doctrine of equivalents
rather microdots structure is described in the prior_art specifically in the chaivre allmanna and erdmann_patents
see pennwalt corp. v. durand-wayland inc. 833_f.2d_931 934_n._1 4 uspq2d 1737 1739_n._1_(fed.cir.1987) cert
denied 485_u.s._961 108_s.ct._1226 99_l.ed.2d_426_(1988)

while not obligatory in every doctrine of equivalents determination the hypothetical_claim rationale of wilson sporting goods co. v. david geoffrey & assocs. 904_f.2d_677 14_uspq2d_1942_(fed.cir.1990) cert
denied 498_u.s._992 111_s.ct._537 112_l.ed.2d_547_(1990) helps define the limits imposed by prior_art on the range of equivalents
the wilson hypothetical_claim analysis does not envision application of a full-blown patentability analysis to a hypothetical_claim
wilson simply acknowledges that prior_art limits the coverage available under the doctrine of equivalents
a range of equivalents may not embrace inventions already disclosed by prior_art

a hypothetical_claim drawn to cover literally the microdot_nut would not be patentable over the prior_art
the chaivre allmanna and erdmann_patents would make the microdot_nut obvious
contrary to keys assertion no single prior_art reference need include each element of the hypothetical_claim
the question under wilson is whether the hypothetical_claim` could have been allowed by the pto over the prior_art'
id.at 684 14 uspq2d at 1948
because the microdot_nuts and thus the hypothetical_claim are obvious in light of these three prior_art_references the doctrine of equivalents does not reach the accused nuts

to support its infringement finding the trial_court erroneously relied on the interchangeability of microdots and keys nuts
while neither party disputes the interchangeability of microdots and keys nuts an interchangeable device is not necessarily an equivalent device

key failed to meet the burden of showing the accused microdot_nuts contain a substantial_equivalent of every element or limitation of the961 claims

conclusion
microdots capped wheel_nuts did not infringe the961_patent claims
therefore the judgment of the district_court is

reversed
