defendant-appellant lifecell corporation` lifecell' appeals from a final_judgment of the u.s. district court for the eastern_district of virginia entered in favor of plaintiff-appellee lifenet health` lifenet'
following claim_construction and trial a jury found lifenets u.s. patent no._6569,200`200_patent` infringed by lifecell and not invalid
the district_court denied lifecells motion for a new_trial and renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law` jmol' on inter_alia claim_construction non-infringement and invalidity

we affirm

background
lifenets200_patent claims plasticized_soft_tissue_grafts suitable for transplantation *1320 into humans
such grafts are useful in various medical orthopedic dental and cosmetic surgery applications
the200_patent explains that tissue_grafts are typically preserved and provided in a dehydrated state such as through freeze-drying then rehydrated before implantation
the patent explains that the freeze-drying process is not optimal it can cause the tissue to become brittle with a tendency to fracture ; it requires time in the operating room to rehydrate the tissue ; and even after rehydration the tissues properties do not approximate that of normal_tissue and the graft can fail

the200_patents` plasticized' tissue_grafts avoid these problems
the tissue is preserved not by freeze-drying but by replacing the tissues water with biocompatible plasticizers such as glycerol that provide the hydrating functions of water
these plasticized grafts exhibit properties similar to that of normal_tissue and avoid the rehydration process required for freeze-dried tissue

the specification explains that while the plasticizers can be removed prior to implantation they need not be
it therefore discloses various options for the implanting clinician 1` direct_implantation of the grafts without further processing following removal from the packaging' ; 2` implantation following a brief washing in sterile_isotonic_saline to remove any remaining traces of plasticizer associated with the immediate surfaces of the grafts' ; or 3` implantation following an extended approximately 1 hour washing with sterile_isotonic_saline to remove as much plasticizer as possible'
'200_patent col. 12_ll._9 -16

lifenet asserted claims 1-4 7 8 and 10 in this case
claims 1-4 are apparatus_claims while claims 7 8 and 10 are method_claims
all of the asserted claims require that` one or more_plasticizers are not removed from [ an ] internal_matrix of [ the ] plasticized_soft_tissue_graft prior to transplantation into a human' or` the non-removal limitation'
for example claim 1 recites 1
a plasticized_soft_tissue_graft suitable for transplantation into a human comprising a cleaned soft_tissue_graft having an internal_matrix ; and
one or more_plasticizers contained in said internal_matrix ; said one or more_plasticizers are not removed from said internal_matrix of said plasticized_soft_tissue_graft prior to transplantation into a human
id.at col. 24_ll._10 -16 emphasis added

the non-removal limitation was added to the claims during prosecution in response to a rejection based on the cavallaro reference u.s. patent no._5718,012`012_patent`
cavallaro also discloses using plasticizers in tissue constructs
in cavallaro the plasticizers are used to improve the tensile_strength of collagen threads and after such` conditioning treatment the plasticizer must.. be removed'
'012_patent col. 7_ll._40 -43
following the examiners rejection for anticipation by cavallaro lifenet amended its claims to add the requirement that` one or more_plasticizers are not removed from an internal_matrix of [ the ] plasticized_soft_tissue_graft prior to transplantation into a human'
j.a
192
as support for the amendment lifenet recited the following language from the specification` replacement of the chemical plasticizers by water prior to implantation is not required and thus the.. soft_tissue plasticized product can be place [ d ] directly into an implant site without..' j.a
193 first and third alterations in original

lifecells accused products are soft_tissue_grafts preserved in a plasticizer solution called solution e. it is undisputed that *1321 users of the accused products are instructed to soak the tissue_grafts in saline solution for a minimum of two minutes prior to implantation and that a significant amount of plasticizers are removed during this two-minute_rinse
lifecell contends there is no evidence to suggest that surgeons have ever implanted the accused products without following those instructions

during claim_construction proceedings the parties disputed the meaning of several terms including the non-removal limitation
the parties dispute at the time centered on the degree of plasticizer removal-whether this limitation required that no plasticizer be removed lifecells position or allowed for some but not all plasticizer to be removed lifenets position
specifically lifecells proposed construction was that` no processing steps are taken before transplantation into a human that result in any amount of the one or more_plasticizers being taken out of the internal_matrix of the plasticized_soft_tissue_graft'
j.a
409 emphasis added
lifenet proposed that the term meant` without complete replacement of the plasticizer or plasticizers in the internal_matrix of the tissue_graft prior to direct_implantation into a human'
id
( emphasis added
the district_court concluded in its markman order that construction of the entire term was` unnecessary' observing that the two-word_phrase`not removed is easily understood by a person of ordinary_skill in the art to have its plain meaning that no plasticizers are removed prior to transplantation'
j.a
65
the district_court later denied lifecells motion for summary judgment that this limitation rendered claims 1-4 indefinite for allegedly including a method step in an apparatus_claim

at trial lifecell argued non-infringement based on evidence showing that as much as 50 % of the plasticizer in the accused products is removed during the two-minute saline rinse
according to lifecell this undisputed removal of plasticizers meant that its products do not meet the claim limitation requiring that plasticizers are` not removed'
in response lifenet did not dispute that plasticizers are removed from the accused tissue_grafts during the two-minute_rinse but maintained that no plasticizers are removed from the internal_matrix of the tissue_graft as recited in the non-removal limitation
according to lifenets expert dr. david kaplan the only plasticizer removed during the rinse is` nonbound' plasticizer that exists in the gaps and voids of the tissue_grafts not plasticizer` bound' to the grafts internal_matrix
j.a
8230-31

after a two-week trial the jury found that lifecells accused tissue_grafts infringed the200_patent
it also found that lifecell had failed to establish any of its invalidity defenses and awarded lifenet $ 34,741,971 in damages
after briefing and oral argument the district_court denied lifecells post-trial motions
lifecell timely filed this appeal

we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

discussion
lifecell raises several issues on appeal
first it submits that the district_court erred by allowing the jury to resolve a dispute about the scope of the limitation` said one or more_plasticizers are not removed from [ an ] internal_matrix of [ the ] plasticized_soft_tissue_graft' and that because the accused products do not meet this limitation jmol of non-infringement is warranted
lifecell also argues that jmol of no direct_infringement is warranted because regardless of how the limitation is construed lifecell itself does not directly infringe ; rather independent surgeons or their assistants prepare the *1322 grafts for transplantation
lifecell further argues that claims 1-4 are invalid as indefinite for covering both an apparatus and through the non-removal limitation a method of using that apparatus
separately lifecell contends that the district_court misconstrued` plasticized_soft_tissue_graft' and that under the correct construction lifecell does not infringe as a matter of law
finally it seeks jmol of invalidity on grounds that the asserted claims are either anticipated by the werner reference u.s. patent no._4357,274 or rendered obvious over werner and the knowledge of a person of ordinary_skill
in the alternative lifecell seeks a new_trial on infringement or invalidity

as noted above the district_court found that no further_construction was needed for the limitation` said one or more_plasticizers are not removed from [ an ] internal_matrix of [ the ] plasticized_soft_tissue_graft prior to transplantation'
see j.a
65
lifecell argues that the district_courts failure to resolve a legal_dispute regarding the scope of that limitation constituted error under o2 micro international ltd. v. beyond innovation technology co. 521_f.3d_1351_(fed._cir._2008)
lifenet responds that the infringement dispute was properly presented to the jury as a factual issue whether the two-minute_wash of the accused products removes plasticizers from the internal_matrix as opposed to the gaps and voids of the tissue_graft

in o2 micro we held that` [ w ] hen the parties raise an actual dispute regarding the proper scope of.. claims the court not the jury must resolve that dispute'
id.at 1360
there is not necessarily an o2_micro_issue however whenever further claim_construction could resolve the parties dispute
for instance` [ t ] he fact that shortly before trial [ a party ] became dissatisfied with its own proposed construction and sought a new one does not give rise to an o2_micro_violation'
nuance commc'ns inc. v. abbyy usa software house inc. 813_f.3d_1368 1373 fed
cir
2016
here in light of lifecells failure to sufficiently request further_construction of the relevant limitation leading up to and during trial we find that it fails to properly raise an o2_micro_issue

according to lifecell the district_court should have instructed the jury that the asserted claims prohibit the removal of any plasticizer from any part of the tissue_graft i.e. whether that plasticizer is bound to the internal_matrix or nonbound in the gaps and voids of the tissue_graft
*1323 as an initial matter we observe that lifecells arguments relate not only to the degree of non-removal required but also more pertinently from where those plasticizers are not to be removed
regarding the degree of removal the district_court agreed with lifecell at the markman_stage to the extent the two-word_phrase`not removed means that no plasticizer is removed'
j.a
66
the court did not however go on to discuss the second issue presented to us from where those plasticizers are not to be removed
indeed the parties did not dispute at the markman_stage that the non-removal as expressly recited in the asserted claims is directed to` the internal_matrix of the.. tissue_graft'
j.a
1522

for context lifenets infringement theory at trial was that while a two-minute_wash of the accused products removes plasticizers from the gaps and voids of the tissue_grafts it does not remove plasticizer bound to the internal_matrix
in other words lifenet did not dispute the degree of removal as lifecell contends but looked to the remainder of the limitation to argue that in the accused products plasticizers are not removed` from [ the ] internal_matrix'
lifecell now argues that this evidence does not support an infringement finding because the internal_matrix and tissue_graft are one and the same-removal of plasticizer from the gaps and voids of the tissue_graft also constitutes removal from the internal_matrix
see opening_br
12 asserting that` the internal_matrix is the tissue_graft'

the problem with lifecells argument is that it did not timely request modification of the district_courts claim_construction
lifecell asserts that it raised the claim_construction dispute with the district_court pointing us to a motion in limine objections and arguments made during trial and a rule 50 a jmol motion
however in those instances lifecell merely sought to exclude testimony contrary to the district_courts claim_construction which to be clear was` [ n ] o further_construction needed' or to have the court instruct the jury as to the degree of removal
lifecell did not dispute that the plasticizer could not be removed` from the internal_matrix of the soft_tissue_graft'
j.a
7790
the district_court granted-in-part lifecells motion in limine but expressly allowed lifenet to` offer testimony that the plasticizers removed do not come from the internal_matrix'
j.a
7609
the court also overruled objections at trial on the same evidentiary issue
in doing so the district_court made clear if it was not clear already that it was not construing the limitation at issue to bar removal of plasticizer from the gaps and voids of the tissue_graft

nevertheless lifecell did not request a new or modified claim_construction
in its rule 50 a motion for jmol filed at the close of lifenets infringement case lifecell continued to present the issue as a factual one arguing that lifenet offered testimony in violation of the courts in limine order and that there was insufficient evidence to find infringement

lifecells objection to the district_courts jury instructions at the end of trial was also insufficient to raise the o2_micro_issue that it presses on appeal
lifecell merely asked the court to replace` no further_construction needed' with a plain-meaning construction consistent with the courts prior statements` plain meaning that no plasticizer is deliberately removed from the internal_matrix of the soft_tissue_graft prior to transplantation into a human'
j.a
7689
even if the district_court had agreed to that jury instruction it would not have been the claim_construction that lifecell now seeks on appeal
lifecell did not ask for clarification of what constitutes *1324 removal` from the internal_matrix'
in fact the parties agreed to the construction of` internal_matrix' as expressly defined in the200_patents specification to mean` the intercellular substance of such soft_tissue including for example ligaments and tendons including collagen and elastin fibers and base matrix substances'
j.a
1521 ;200_patent col. 6_ll._59 -65
lifecell never asked the court to adopt its argument that` internal_matrix' is synonymous with` tissue_graft'

in sum lifecells evidentiary challenges and request for a claim_construction did not adequately present the refashioned claim_construction_argument that it now raises on appeal

cir
2010` [ i ] t was incumbent upon [ the appellant ] to raise its claim_construction_argument before the district_court and having failed to do so [ it ] can not now resurrect that argument on appeal by pointing to ambiguous statements in the record`
lifecells discontent with the agreed-upon construction of` internal_matrix' or with the district_courts view of the longer phrase` said one or more_plasticizers are not removed from [ an ] internal_matrix of [ the ] plasticized_soft_tissue_graft prior to implantation into a human' is not sufficient to give rise to an o2_micro_violation
see nuance 813 f.3d at 1373 finding no o2_micro_issue when the district_court adopted the appellants proposed plain-meaning construction and the appellant became dissatisfied with that construction shortly before trial1

as lifenet submits the parties presented a factual dispute at trial as to whether a two-minute_rinse removes plasticizers from the internal_matrix of the accused tissue_grafts
although lifecell does not expressly challenge the sufficiency of the evidence on this issue it points to purported inconsistencies in lifenets evidence
for example lifecell argues that lifenets expert dr._kaplan contradicted his own sworn statements and that lifenets witnesses provided` uniform trial_testimony.. that the internal_matrix is the graft'
opening_br
35-37
we disagree with these characterizations of the evidence

we do not accept lifecells argument that dr._kaplans trial_testimony regarding the non-removal of plasticizers from the internal_matrix of the accused products` deserves no weight' because it supposedly contradicted his markman declaration
see id.at 36
lifecell points to an excerpt of dr._kaplans declaration stating that the200_patent discloses plasticizing in a new way that` does not require rehydration or even washing to remove the plasticizer s from the internal_matrix of the graft'
j.a
1220
lifecell interprets that testimony to imply that removal of plasticizer is not difficult contrasting it with dr._kaplans trial_testimony that removing plasticizer from the *1325 internal_matrix would be` very difficult because its strongly bound into the surrounding structures' and that a two-minute_rinse would not remove plasticizer from the internal_matrix
j.a
8196 8234
we see no inconsistency in dr._kaplans testimony
in the declaration excerpt he was speaking to an advantage of the claimed invention over the prior_art not to the degree of difficulty of removing plasticizer from the internal_matrix
nor did dr._kaplan say at trial that plasticizer can never be removed from the internal_matrix only that in the context of the technology at issue such removal would disrupt the matrix

we also reject lifecells assertion that lifenets witnesses agreed that an internal_matrix is the same as a tissue_graft such that the asserted claims prohibit removal of plasticizer from anywhere in the tissue_graft
lifecell points to the testimony of a lifenet witness dr._qin who said that` when we implant the tissue its basically just the matrix'
j.a
7955
however not only did dr._qin qualify his testimony but that testimony was also in response to a question about revascularization not what` internal_matrix' means relative to` tissue' in the context of the200_patent
dr._kaplan meanwhile did opine on` internal_matrix' in the context of the200_patent and stated that it is composed of the components left after a soft_tissue_graft has been cleaned
when asked if anything other than the internal_matrix would be` left behind' he responded` yes
when you go through this process you are going to leave a huge number of voids in the tissue.. and also youll have a great deal of water left in the [ t ] issue'
j.a
8188
on cross-examination he again differentiated the internal_matrix from the tissue_graft opining that the graft` includes [ the ] internal_matrix.. but theres other [ sic ] plenty of loose water unbound water' as well as` voids and other spaces where youve decellularized'
j.a
8274-75
as noted above the parties agreed to the construction of` internal_matrix' which was drawn from an express definition in the specification that did not refer to voids or gaps and dr._kaplans testimony was consistent with that construction

against this background we find that there was substantial_evidence to support the jurys determination that plasticizer is not removed` from the internal_matrix' of the accused tissue_grafts before transplantation
the jury was free to rely on dr._kaplans testimony and to find as a factual matter that the accused products meet the limitation at issue
the district_court did not err in denying jmol or a new_trial on non-infringement

b
based on the non-removal limitation and under the law of divided infringement lifecell also argues that it can not be liable for direct_infringement regardless of how that limitation is construed
direct_infringement of an apparatus_claim` requires that each and every limitation set forth in a claim appear in an accused product'
cross med prods. inc. v. medtronic_sofamor_danek inc. 424_f.3d_1293 1310 fed
cir
2005
direct_infringement of a method claim requires all steps of the claimed method to be performed by or attributable to a single_entity
bmc res. inc. v. paymentech l.p. 498_f.3d_1373 1379-81 fed
cir
2007
although we may attribute a third_partys performance of method steps to a single_entity in some circumstances see akamai techs. inc. v. limelight networks inc. 797_f.3d_1020_(fed._cir._2015) en banc per curiam lifenet did not pursue an attribution theory at trial

*1326 lifecell posits that the non-removal limitation can not be met until an independent third_party such as a surgeon actually prepares and uses the accused products and it is unknown at the time that lifecell sells a graft if and how that graft will be used for transplantation.2 lifenet counters that` the final product that leaves lifecells hands is complete and.. infringes in that condition' without affirmative_action by a third_party
response br

we agree with lifenet

functional limitations recited in the negative may describe a capability or structural element
see amgen inc. v. hoechst marion roussel inc. 314_f.3d_1313 1329 fed
cir
2003 holding that` non-naturally occurring' and` not isolated' were structural elements defining the source of the claimed material rather than steps for obtaining it
here the preceding language in each asserted claim states that the relevant plasticizers are already part of the tissue_graft
see e.g.200_patent col. 24_l._12_(``plasticizers_contained_in_[the]_internal_matrix'') ; id.at_col. 24_ll._41 -42` impregnating a cleaned soft_tissue_graft with one or more_plasticizers'
the non-removal limitation simply provides a negative limitation that those plasticizers remain in the internal_matrix prior to transplantation

lifecell relies on cross_medical products inc. v. medtronic_sofamor_danek inc. 424_f.3d_1293 fed
cir
2005 and centillion data systems llc v. qwest communications international inc. 631_f.3d_1279_(fed._cir._2011) to argue that there can be no direct_infringement by a single_entity when a limitation is absent until a third_party takes action
however those cases are distinguishable
in cross_medical we held that surgical implants with an interface that had to be` operatively joined' to a segment of bone could not be directly infringed by the manufacturer insofar as that party` d [ id ] not itself make an apparatus' with the relevant portion already in contact with bone
424 f.3d at 1311
rather a third_party surgeon had to` actually bring the [ relevant part ] into contact with bone'
id.at 1310
similarly in centillion we held that the accused infringer who provided software to customers did not itself practice a limitation requiring a` personal_computer_data_processing_means' because` it is entirely the decision of the customer whether to install and operate th [ e ] software on its personal_computer_data_processing_means'
631 f.3d at 1287
the claimed inventions in cross_medical and centillion affirmatively required action by a third_party without which a limitation would be absent
here in contrast the non-removal limitation clarifies that the recited plasticizer has not been removed and because the plasticizer is biocompatible can remain in the internal_matrix of the tissue_graft during transplantation i.e. it need not ever be removed
this limitation is met without action by a third_party
it is satisfied by the graft from the moment it is manufactured unless and until the plasticizer is removed from the internal_matrix before transplantation

therefore the non-removal limitation does not relieve lifecell of direct_infringement

c. lifecell also contends that because the non-removal limitation describes a method of use while the remainder of claims 1-4 describes an apparatus those claims are indefinite for covering both an *1327 apparatus and a method of using that apparatus
the ultimate determination of indefiniteness is a question of law reviewed de_novo` although as with claim_construction any factual_findings by the district_court based on extrinsic_evidence are reviewed for clear_error'
ultimatepointer llc v. nintendo co. 816_f.3d_816 826 fed
cir
2016

lifecell relies on ipxl holdings llc v. amazon.com inc. 430_f.3d_1377_(fed._cir._2005) in which we held a claim invalid for indefiniteness when` as a result of the combination of two separate statutory classes of invention a manufacturer or seller of the claimed apparatus would not know from the claim whether it might also be liable for contributory infringement because a buyer or user of the apparatus later performs the claimed method of using the apparatus'
id.at 1384
as explained above however the non-removal limitation defines a property of the recited plasticizer in that the plasticizer is biocompatible and does not need to be removed from the internal_matrix before transplantation in the context of apparatus_claims 1-4 so no later action by a user of the tissue_graft is necessary
those claims therefore do not mix an apparatus with a method of using that apparatus and the district_court did not err in denying jmol as to indefiniteness

d. lifecell separately argues that the district_court erred in its construction of` plasticized_soft_tissue_graft'
the district_court construed this limitation to require inter_alia that` free and loosely bound waters of hydration in the tissue have been replaced with one or more_plasticizers'
j.a
63 emphasis added

lifecell contends that the district_court mistakenly failed to also require that the tissue_graft be` dehydrated' in the sense that the tissue can only have` low residual moisture'
opening_br
43-44
under that construction lifecell contends there can be no infringement as a matter of law because the accused products have at least 60 % moisture
lifenet responds that` dehydration' as that word is used in the200_patent merely means that some of the water has been replaced with plasticizer and that the district_courts construction already includes that understanding

we agree with lifenet
although lifecell is correct that the written description repeatedly uses the word` dehydrated' it does so broadly
for example the specification discusses` soft_tissue which is preserved by dehydration such drying methods including for example freeze-drying and/or sublimation and/or air drying and/or liquid substitution'
'200_patent col. 6_ll._35 -39 emphasis added
although the specification states that` [ t ] he present invention provides a dehydrated or freeze-dried plasticized bone or soft_tissue product preferably containing less than 5 % residual moisture' id.at_col. 5_ll._29 -31 we decline to confine the claims to such an embodiment where as in this context there is no indication that the` patentee.. intend [ ed ] for the claims and the embodiments in the specification to be strictly coextensive' phillips 415 f.3d at 1323
there is no support for the proposition that the claimed soft_tissue_graft must be dehydrated to a certain degree or completely desiccated
the addition of the word` dehydrated' to the claim_construction would be redundant of the requirement for plasticizer to replace some water which is already properly part of the district_courts construction

we decline to adopt lifecells proposed construction of` plasticized_soft_tissue_graft' and lifecell does not otherwise argue that the jurys infringement verdict lacks substantial_evidence
therefore we *1328 do not disturb the courts denial of jmol of non-infringement or a new_trial on this ground

e. finally we address lifecells argument that the asserted claims are either anticipated by werner or obvious in view of werner and the knowledge of a person of ordinary_skill
anticipation is a question of fact reviewed for substantial_evidence

werner is a patent that discloses a process for treating a soft_tissue with hydrogen peroxide and other steps to increase biological stability
at trial lifenet disputed whether werner meets two limitations of the asserted claims` cleaned' and` plasticized_soft_tissue_graft'
lifecell argues on appeal that` [ t ] he evidence allows only one reasonable conclusion' -that werner discloses both limitations and therefore anticipates the asserted claims

alternatively it argues that werner` at most.. would lack a sufficient degree ofcleaning the tissue which would have been an obvious_modification to a person skill in the art at the time of the invention'

with respect to a` plasticized_soft_tissue_graft' the district_court construed that limitation to specifically require inter_alia that plasticization occur` without altering the orientation of the collagen fibers such that the mechanical_properties including the material physical and use properties of the tissue product are similar to those of normal hydrated tissue'

lifecell does not direct us to any evidence from its affirmative case to support its burden of showing that werner discloses a` plasticized_soft_tissue_graft'

2013` [ t ] he burden of persuasion [ as to invalidity ] remains with the challenger during litigation`
aside from arguing for a different construction of` plasticized_soft_tissue_graft' which we have rejected lifecell focuses on trying to undermine dr._kaplans testimony that werners process renders the mechanical_properties of tissue different from native_tissue

a review of the record shows that there is substantial_evidence to support a jury finding that werner does not disclose a plasticized_soft_tissue_graft under the district_courts construction
dr._kaplan explained that unlike the200_patent in werner` the mechanical_properties are altered significantly from native_tissue' namely by` increas [ ing ].. tensile_strength by a factor of 1.big_token__7_to_7__big_token0'

9279 explaining that werner does not retain the` mechanical_properties of the native-like tissue'
although dr._kaplan conceded on cross-examination that the data was not statistically different he maintained that the difference in mechanical_properties between werners tissue and native_tissue was still a basis for finding those properties not similar enough to meet the courts construction of` plasticized_soft_tissue_graft'
lifecells expert dr. stephen badylak testified that he could not say whether or not the tensile_strength difference that dr._kaplan relied on was` similar' under the courts construction

however he agreed on cross-examination that` the mechanical_properties including the physical and use properties' of werner` have changed' and stated that he was` starting to think [ the change in tensile_strength ] is different'

the ultimate issue on this record was a classic factual dispute that the jury was *1329 free to resolve in lifenets favor

2012` [ s ] ubstantial evidence supports the jurys implied factual finding that none of these references disclosed the [ limitation at issue ]`
since there is substantial_evidence to support a finding that werner fails to disclose` plasticized_soft_tissue_graft' we need not reach the` cleaned' limitation
the district_court did not err in denying lifecells request for jmol or a new_trial with respect to anticipation

lifecell only argues obviousness on appeal with respect to the` cleaned' limitation
it does not point to any evidence that a` plasticized_soft_tissue_graft' if not disclosed by werner would have been an obvious_modification to a person of ordinary_skill in the art
as lifecell fails to provide a basis for disclosure of a` plasticized_soft_tissue_graft' outside of werner the district_court also did not err in denying jmol or a new_trial on obviousness

conclusion
for the foregoing reasons we affirm the district_courts judgment

affirmed

even if we were to reach the construction of the non-removal limitation we see no error with the courts construction under the principles of phillips v. awh corp. 415_f.3d_1303_(fed._cir._2005) en banc
the patentee added the non-removal limitation in response to a rejection during prosecution and cited a passage from the specification stating that the claimed invention could be directly implanted into a patient without preparation
that statement however was just one example of the non-removal limitation no rinse prior to transplantation and did not necessarily disclaim other embodiments disclosed in the specification e.g. a brief rinse or a one-hour wash prior to implantation that are consistent with the specifications teaching that plasticizer need not be replaced by water prior to implantation
