opinion
rader circuit_judge
on summary_judgment the united_states_district_court for the district of new_jersey determined that claims 1_and_3 of u.s._patent_no._4659,716 the ¡¬716_patent are invalid
schering_corp. v. geneva pharm. inc. no._98-1259 2002_wl_2001552 d.n.j
aug.8 2002
because the district_court correctly found that u.s._patent_no._4282,233 the ¡¬233_patent inherently anticipates claims 1_and_3 of the ¡¬716_patent this court affirms

*1375 i. schering corporation schering owns the ¡¬233 and ¡¬716_patent s on antihistamines
antihistamines inhibit the histamines that cause allergic symptoms

the prior_art_¡¬233_patent covers the antihistamine loratadine the active component of a pharmaceutical that schering markets as claritin tm
unlike conventional antihistamines when claritin tm was launched loratadine does not cause drowsiness

the more recent ¡¬716_patent at issue in this case covers a metabolite of loratadine called descarboethoxyloratadine dcl
a metabolite is the compound formed in the patients body upon ingestion of a pharmaceutical
the ingested pharmaceutical undergoes a chemical conversion in the digestion process to form a new metabolite compound
the metabolite_dcl is also a non-drowsy antihistamine
the ¡¬716_patent issued in april 1987 and will expire in april 2004 the ¡¬233_patent issued in 1981 and has since expired
see 35 u.s.c.¡± 154 c 1 2000 defining the term of a patent in force before june_8,_1995 as the greater of twenty years from the earliest u.s. priority date or seventeen years from grant

structurally loratadine and its metabolite_dcl differ only in that loratadine has a carboethoxy group i.e. -cooet on a ring_nitrogen while dcl has a hydrogen atom on that ring_nitrogen

?
claim 1 of the ¡¬716_patent covers dcl for x = cl its fluorine analog and their salts ; claim 3 covers only dcl and its salts 1
a compound of the formula

?
or a pharmaceutically acceptable_salt thereof wherein x represents cl or f. 3
a compound having the structural formula
*1376. ?
or a pharmaceutically acceptable_salt thereof
the ¡¬233_patent issued on august 4 1981 over one year before the earliest priority date of the ¡¬716_patent february 15 1984
the ¡¬233_patent is thus prior_art to the ¡¬716_patent
see 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b 2000` a person shall be entitled to a patent unless.. the invention was patented.. in this or a foreign country.. more than one year prior to the date of the application for patent in the united states`
the ¡¬233_patent discloses a class of compounds including loratadine disclosed in example 1b
¡¬233_patent col._3,_ll._5-12
the ¡¬233_patent claims loratadine in claim 7
id. col._6,_ll._38-40
the ¡¬233_patent claims four other compounds in claims 8-11
examples 6-7 are prophetic1 examples of pharmaceutical_compositions a syrup and a tablet each containing an unidentified` active compound'
the ¡¬233_patent does not expressly disclose dcl and does not refer to metabolites of loratadine

the numerous defendants-appellees sought to market generic versions of loratadine once the ¡¬233_patent expired
seeking regulatory approval each appellee submitted an application to the food and drug_administration fda
see 21 u.s.c.¡± 355 b j 2000
because schering included the ¡¬ 716 patent in the orange book listing for loratadine the applications also contained a certification that the ¡¬716_patent was invalid
see id.¡± 355 b 2 a 355 j 2 a vii
the appellees notified schering of the fda_filings
see id.¡± 355 b 3 b 355 j 2 b ii

after receiving notice of the fda_filings schering filed suit for infringement
see 35 u.s.c.¡± 271 e 2 a 2000
after discovery the parties filed cross motions for summary_judgment on the validity issue
the district_court construed claims 1_and_3 of the ¡¬716_patent to cover dcl in all its forms including` metabolized within the human_body' and` synthetically produced in a purified and isolated_form'
the parties agreed to that construction
applying that claim construction the district_court found that the ¡¬233_patent did not expressly disclose dcl
nonetheless the district_court also found that dcl was necessarily formed as a metabolite by carrying out the process disclosed in the ¡¬233_patent
the district_court concluded that the ¡¬233_patent anticipated claims 1_and_3 of the ¡¬716_patent under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b
the district_court therefore granted the appellees motions for summary_judgment of invalidity
schering timely appealed to this court under 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1 2000

ii
this court reviews a grant of summary_judgment without deference
*1377 telemac cellular corp. v. topp telecom inc. 247_f.3d_1316 1323 fed.cir.2001
in reviewing a summary_judgment determination this court draws all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-movant
anderson v. liberty_lobby inc. 477_u.s._242 255 106_s.ct._2505 91_l.ed.2d_202_(1986)

a
a patent is invalid for anticipation if a single_prior_art_reference discloses each and every limitation of the claimed invention
lewmar marine inc. v. barient inc. 827_f.2d_744 747 fed.cir.1987
moreover a prior_art_reference may anticipate without disclosing a feature of the claimed invention if that missing characteristic is necessarily present or inherent in the single anticipating reference
continental can co. v. monsanto co. 948_f.2d_1264 1268 fed.cir.1991

at the outset this court rejects the contention that inherent_anticipation requires recognition in the prior_art
schering relies on elan pharmaceuticals inc. v. mayo foundation for medical education & research 304_f.3d_1221_(fed.cir.2002) for that proposition
this court has since vacated elan
see 304_f.3d_1221_(fed.cir.2002)
other precedents of this court have held that inherent_anticipation does not require that a person of ordinary_skill in the art at the time would have recognized the inherent_disclosure
e.g. in re cruciferous sprout litig. 301_f.3d_1343 1351 fed.cir.2002 ; mehl/biophile int l corp. v. milgraum 192_f.3d_1362 1366 fed.cir.1999` where.. the result is a necessary_consequence of what was deliberately intended it is of no import that the articles authors did not appreciate the results
`` ; atlas_powder 190 f.3d at 1348-49` becausesufficient aeration was inherent in the prior_art it is irrelevant that the prior_art did not recognize the key aspect of [ the ] invention.. an inherent structure composition or function is not necessarily known`
thus recognition by a person of ordinary_skill in the art before the critical_date of the ¡¬716_patent is not required to show anticipation by inherency
the district_court therefore did not err in allowing for later recognition of the inherent characteristics of the prior_art_¡¬233_patent

contrary to scherings contention continental can does not stand for the proposition that an inherent_feature of a prior_art_reference must be perceived as such by a person of ordinary_skill in the art before the critical_date
in continental can this court vacated summary_judgment of anticipation of claims reciting a plastic_bottle with hollow_ribs over a prior_art_reference disclosing a plastic_bottle
the record contained conflicting expert_testimony about whether the ribs of the prior_art_plastic_bottle were solid
the accused infringers expert testified that the prior_art_plastic_bottle was made by blow_molding a process that would inherently produce hollow_ribs
the patentees experts testified that the prior_art_plastic_bottle had solid ribs
the patentee disputed whether the blow_molding inherently produced hollow_ribs
given the disputed material_fact this court vacated the summary_judgment as improper
continental can 948 f.2d at 1269
continental can makes no reference to whether the inherent_feature hollow_ribs was recognized before or after the critical_date of the patent at issue
read in context continental can stands for the proposition that inherency like anticipation itself requires a determination of the meaning of the prior_art
thus a court may consult artisans of ordinary_skill to ascertain their understanding about subject_matter disclosed by the prior_art including features inherent in the prior_art
a court may resolve factual questions about the subject_matter in the prior_art by examining the reference through the eyes of a person of ordinary_skill in the *1378 art among other sources of evidence about the meaning of the prior_art
thus in continental can this court did not require past recognition of the inherent_feature but only allowed recourse to opinions of skilled_artisans to determine the scope of the prior_art_reference

cases dealing with` accidental unwitting and unappreciated' anticipation also do not show that inherency requires recognition
see eibel process co. v. minn. & ontario paper co. 261_u.s._45 43_s.ct._322 67_l.ed._523_(1923) ; tilghman v. proctor 102_u.s._707 26_l.ed._279_(1880)
in contrast to the present case the record in eibel and tilghman did not show that the prior_art produced the claimed subject_matter
the patent at issue in tilghman claimed a method of forming free fatty acids and glycerine by heating fats with water at high pressure
in tilghman the record did not show conclusively that the claimed process occurred in the prior_art
in reviewing the prior_art the court referred hypothetically to possible disclosure of the claimed process
for example the court stated` [ w ] e do not regard the accidental formation of fat_acid in perkinss steam cylinder.. if the scum which rose on the water issuing from the ejection pipe was fat_acid as of any consequence in this inquiry'
tilghman 102 u.s. at 711
in eibel the court found no evidence of the claimed subject_matter in the prior_art
eibel 261 u.s. at 66 43_s.ct._322` [ w ] e find no evidence that any pitch of the wire.. had brought about such a result.. and.. if it had done so under unusual_conditions accidental results not intended and not appreciated do not constitute anticipation
``

applying an inherency principle in the context of an on sale bar under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b this court has distinguished eibel and tilghman
see abbott labs
v. geneva pharms. inc. 182_f.3d_1315 1319 fed.cir.1999` if a product that is offered for sale inherently possesses each of the limitations of the claims then the invention is on sale whether or not the parties to the transaction recognize that the product possesses the claimed characteristics
`` ; scaltech inc. v. retec/tetra llc 269_f.3d_1321 1330 fed.cir.2001` [ a ] ppreciation of the invention is not a requirement to trigger the statutory [ on sale ] bar`
in those cases the product sold or offered for sale had an inherent but unrecognized feature that was a limitation of the asserted claims
id
thus this court has distinguished eibel and tilghman which therefore do not bind this court to find no anticipation because skilled_artisans did not recognize that the prior_art_¡¬233_patent inherently produced the claimed invention dcl

in the context of accidental anticipation dcl is not formed accidentally or under unusual_conditions when loratadine is ingested
the record shows that dcl necessarily and inevitably forms from loratadine under normal conditions
dcl is a necessary_consequence of administering loratadine to patients
the record also shows that dcl provides a useful result because it serves as an active non-drowsy antihistamine
in sum this courts precedent does not require a skilled artisan to recognize the inherent characteristic in the prior_art that anticipates the claimed invention

b
this court recognizes that this may be a case of first impression because the prior_art supplies no express description of any part of the claimed subject_matter
the prior_art_¡¬233_patent does not disclose any compound that is identifiable as dcl
in this courts prior inherency cases a single_prior_art_reference generally contained an incomplete description of the anticipatory subject_matter i.e. a partial description missing certain aspects
inherency *1379 supplied the missing aspect of the description
upon proof that the missing description is inherent in the prior_art that single_prior_art_reference placed the claimed subject_matter in the public_domain
this case does not present the issue of a missing feature of the claimed invention
rather the new structure in this case dcl is not described by the prior ¡¬233_patent

patent law nonetheless establishes that a prior_art_reference which expressly or inherently contains each and every limitation of the claimed subject_matter anticipates and invalidates
see e.g. emi group n
am. inc. v. cypress semiconductor corp. 268_f.3d_1342 1350 fed.cir.2001` a prior_art_reference anticipates a patent claim if the reference discloses either expressly or inherently all of the limitations of the claim
`` ; verdegaal bros. inc. v. union oil co. of cal. 814_f.2d_628 631 fed.cir.1987` a claim is anticipated only if each and every element as set forth in the claim is found either expressly or inherently described in a single_prior_art_reference`
in these prior cases however inherency was only necessary to supply a single missing limitation that was not expressly disclosed in the prior_art
this case as explained before asks this court to find anticipation when the entire structure of the claimed subject_matter is inherent in the prior_art

because inherency places subject_matter in the public_domain as well as an express disclosure the inherent_disclosure of the entire claimed subject_matter anticipates as well as inherent_disclosure of a single feature of the claimed subject_matter
the extent of the inherent_disclosure does not limit its anticipatory effect
in general a limitation or the entire invention is inherent and in the public_domain if it is the` natural_result flowing from' the explicit disclosure of the prior_art
see eli lilly & co. v. barr labs. inc. 251_f.3d_955 970 fed.cir.2001 ; see also in re kratz 592_f.2d_1169 1174 ccpa 1979 suggesting inherent_anticipation of a compound even though the compounds existence was not known

in reaching this conclusion this court is aware of in re seaborg 51_c.c.p.a._1109 328_f.2d_996_(ccpa_1964)
in that case this courts predecessor considered claims drawn to an isotope of americium made by nuclear reaction in light of a prior_art_patent disclosing a similar nuclear reaction process but with no disclosure of the claimed isotope
the court reversed a united states patent and trademark office rejection of the claims for lack of novelty
this courts predecessor found that the prior_art process did not anticipate the claims because the process would have produced at most one billionth of a gram of the isotope in forty tons of radioactive material i.e. the isotope would have been undetectable
id.at 998-99` [ t ] he claimed product if it was produced in the fermi process was produced in such minuscule amounts and under such conditions that its presence was undetectable`
in this case dcl forms in readily detectable amounts as shown by the extensive record evidence of testing done on humans to verify the formation of dcl upon ingestion of loratadine

this court sees no reason to modify the general rule for inherent_anticipation in a case where inherency supplies the entire anticipatory subject_matter
the patent law principle` that which would literally infringe if later in time anticipates if earlier' bristol-myers_squibb_co. v. ben venue labs. inc. 246_f.3d_1368 1378 fed.cir.2001 bolsters this conclusion
similarly` if granting patent_protection on the disputed claim would allow the patentee to exclude the public from practicing the prior_art then that claim is anticipated'
atlas_powder 190 f.3d at 1346
`` the *1380 public remains free to make use or sell prior_art compositions or processes regardless of whether or not they understand their complete makeup or the underlying scientific principles which allow them to operate
the doctrine of anticipation by inherency among other doctrines enforces that basic principle'
id.at 1348
thus inherency operates to anticipate entire inventions as well as single limitations within an invention

turning to this case the use of loratadine would infringe claims 1_and_3 of the ¡¬716_patent covering the metabolite_dcl
this court has recognized that a person may infringe a claim to a metabolite if the person ingests a compound that metabolizes to form the metabolite
see hoechst-roussel pharms. inc. v. lehman 109_f.3d_756 759 fed.cir.1997` [ t ] he right to exclude may arise from the fact that when administered [ the accused product ] metabolizes into another product.. which hoechst has claimed
`` ; see also zenith labs. inc. v. bristol-myers_squibb_co. 19_f.3d_1418 1421-22 fed.cir.1994 stating that a compound_claim could cover a compound formed upon ingestion
an identical metabolite must then anticipate if earlier in time than the claimed compound

the record shows that the metabolite of the prior_art loratadine is the same compound as the claimed invention
claims 1_and_3 are compound_claims in which individual compounds are claimed in the alternative in markush format
dcl is within the scope of claims 1_and_3
because the prior_art metabolite inherently disclosed dcl claims 1_and_3 are anticipated and invalid
in other words the record shows that a patient ingesting loratadine would necessarily metabolize that compound to dcl
that later act would thus infringe claims 1_and_3
thus a prior_art_reference showing administration of loratadine to a patient anticipates claims 1_and_3

c. this court next examines whether scherings secret tests of loratadine before the critical_date placed dcl in the public_domain
before the critical_date schering only tested loratadine in secret
thus according to schering` dcl was not publicly used or described in any printed publication until after february 15 1983 the critical_date for the ¡¬716_patent under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b'
schering thus argues that dcl did not` exist' in the public_domain such that dcl could be prior_art against the ¡¬716_patent

anticipation does not require the actual creation or reduction to practice of the prior_art subject_matter ; anticipation requires only an enabling disclosure
in re_donohue 766_f.2d_531 533 fed.cir.1985
thus actual administration of loratadine to patients before the critical_date of the ¡¬716_patent is irrelevant
the ¡¬233_patent suffices as an anticipatory prior_art_reference if it discloses in an enabling manner the administration of loratadine to patients

thus this court examines whether the ¡¬233_patent contains an enabling disclosure of dcl
a reference may enable one of skill in the art to make and use a compound even if the author or inventor did not actually make or reduce to practice that subject_matter
bristol-myers 246 f.3d at 1379 ; see also in re_donohue 766 f.2d at 533 sustaining an anticipation rejection over a reference disclosing a compound and other references disclosing sufficient information to make that compound
indeed information arising after the critical_date may show that the claimed subject_matter as disclosed in a prior_art_reference` was in the publics possession'
bristol-myers 246 f.3d at 1379 citing in re_donohue 766 f.2d at 534

*1381 an anticipatory reference need only enable subject_matter that falls within the scope of the claims at issue nothing more
to qualify as an enabled reference the ¡¬233_patent need not describe how to make dcl in its isolated_form
the ¡¬233_patent need only describe how to make dcl in any form encompassed by a compound_claim covering dcl e.g. dcl as a metabolite in a patients body
the ¡¬233_patent discloses administering loratadine to a patient
a person of ordinary_skill in the art could practice the ¡¬233_patent without undue experimentation
the inherent result of administering loratadine to a patient is the formation of dcl
the ¡¬233_patent thus provides an enabling disclosure for making dcl

d. finally this courts conclusion on inherent_anticipation in this case does not preclude patent_protection for metabolites of known drugs
with proper claiming patent_protection is available for metabolites of known drugs
cf
in re kratz 592_f.2d_1169 1174 ccpa 1979 stating that a naturally occurring strawberry constituent compound does not anticipate claims to the substantially pure compound ; in re bergstrom 57_c.c.p.a._1240 427_f.2d_1394 1401-02 ccpa 1970 stating that a material occurring in nature in less pure form does not anticipate claims to the pure material

but those metabolites may not receive protection via compound_claims
in this case for instance claims 1_and_3 broadly encompass compounds defined by structure only
such bare compound_claims include within their scope the recited compounds as chemical species in any surroundings including within the human_body as metabolites of a drug
as this case holds these broad compound_claims are inherently anticipated by a prior_art disclosure of a drug that metabolizes into the claimed compound

a skilled patent drafter however might fashion a claim to cover the metabolite in a way that avoids anticipation
for example the metabolite may be claimed in its pure and isolated_form as in kratz and bergstrom or as a pharmaceutical composition e.g. with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier
the patent drafter could also claim a method of administering the metabolite or the corresponding pharmaceutical composition
the ¡¬233_patent would not provide an enabling disclosure to anticipate such claims because for instance the ¡¬233_patent does not disclose isolation of dcl

the ¡¬716_patent contains claims 5-13 covering pharmaceutical_compositions and claims 14-16 covering methods of treating allergic reactions by administering compounds that include dcl
these claims were not found anticipated by the ¡¬233_patent

iii
the district_court found that` there is no genuine_issue that the consumption of loratadine by humans with a wide variety of health statuses necessarily results in the natural production in the human_body of the dcl metabolite'
this court must also examine the record for any genuine_issue of material_fact about whether ingestion of loratadine necessarily produces dcl
the record does for instance contain expert_testimony including a proposed metabolic scheme and animal data that questions whether ingestion of loratadine always forms dcl

a dispute about a material_fact is genuine` if the evidence is such that a reasonable_jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party'
anderson v. liberty_lobby inc. 477_u.s._242 248 106_s.ct._2505 91_l.ed.2d_202_(1986)
in this case the evidence supporting the district_courts *1382 conclusion is extensive
in thirteen clinical_studies that schering ran before may_1,_1987 all 144 patients involved had measurable_amounts of dcl in their systems after ingesting loratadine
the district_court found` no reports in any of the studies of any individual who did not metabolically produce dcl following the administration of loratadine'
the appellees reported twenty-one clinical_studies in which loratadine was administered to a total of 864 patients all of whom formed measurable_amounts of dcl in their systems
in addition the record shows that since 1985 scherings technical articles and securities and exchange commission filings referred to dcl as the metabolite of loratadine
also the food and drug_administration the corresponding european agency the physicians desk reference and scherings claritin package insert referred to dcl as the major metabolite of loratadine

the record presents no data on humans to show that a genuine factual dispute exists about the formation of dcl after ingesting loratadine
indeed scherings own expert testified that no human has been found that does not metabolize loratadine to dcl and that` [ t ] here is no scientific data in the published literature that says that dcl is not formed from loratadine in humans'
based on this record no reasonable_jury could find that dcl is not produced when a human ingests loratadine
this court therefore discerns no genuine_issue of material_fact

conclusion
the district_court did not err in finding that the ¡¬233_patent discloses administering loratadine to a patient and that dcl forms as a natural_result of that administration
the district_court correctly concluded that dcl is inherent in the prior_art
without any genuine_issues of material_fact the district_court correctly granted summary_judgment that claims 1_and_3 are invalid as anticipated by the ¡¬233_patent
