opinion
pauline newman circuit_judge
the initial opinion in this appeal reported at elan_pharmaceuticals inc. v. mayo_foundation 304_f.3d_1221 64_uspq2d_1292_(fed.cir.2002) has been vacated 314_f.3d_1299_(fed.cir.2002) en banc and is replaced with this opinion and decision

the united_states_district_court for the northern_district of california granting the mayo_foundations motion for summary_judgment of patent invalidity held that elans two patents in suit united_states_patent_no._5612,486 the ¡¬486_patent for` transgenic animals harboring app allele having swedish_mutation' and patent no._5850,003 the ¡¬003_patent for` transgenic rodents harboring app allele having swedish_mutation' are invalid on the ground of anticipation by united_states_patent_no._5455,169 entitled` nucleic acids for diagnosing and modeling alzheimers disease' the mullan_reference1

in response to the questions raised in the petitions for reconsideration we clarify that invalidity based on anticipation requires that the assertedly anticipating disclosure enabled the subject_matter of the reference and thus of the patented invention without undue_experimentation
applying this rule we remand for determination of whether the mullan_reference was an enabling disclosure
the summary_judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings

background
at the time of the elan_invention it was known that the brains of people with alzheimers disease contain abnormal tangles and deposits of plaques and that a principal component of the plaques is a protein fragment called beta-amyloid peptide or betaap also designated aap and aa
the formation of betaap in brain tissue is *1053 believed to induce or foster formation of alzheimers disease plaques

it is believed that a mechanism by which betaap is formed is the abnormal_cleavage of a protein produced in brain cells called the amyloid precursor protein app ; and that this abnormal_cleavage occurs when an enzyme produced in the brain called beta-secretase cleaves the app molecule between amino_acids 596_and_597 ; and a second enzyme produced in the brain called gamma-secretase releases the betaap fragment from a portion of the cleaved app
the mechanism is illustrated in the elan brief as follows

?
humans who do not develop alzheimers disease are believed to break down the app in a manner that does not form significant amounts of betaap in the brain

the swedish_mutation is an abnormal gene2 that was discovered on chromosome 21 in a swedish family that has an unusually high incidence of early-onset alzheimers disease
this mutation is described in the mullan_patent as a variation in the dna nucleotides that encode codons 670_and_6713 wherein lysine and methionine the amino_acids normally encoded at these positions are replaced with asparagine and leucine

the elan_patents are directed to transgenic_rodents whose genetic makeup has been modified to include the swedish_mutation
claim 1 of the ¡¬486_patent is representative 1
a transgenic_rodent_comprising
a diploid genome comprising a transgene encoding a heterologous_app_polypeptide having the swedish_mutation wherein the amino_acid residues at positions corresponding to positions 595_and_596 in human_app695 are asparagine and leucine respectively wherein the transgene is expressed to produce a human_app_polypeptide having the swedish_mutation and wherein said polypeptide is processed to atf-betaapp in a sufficient_amount to be detectable in a brain_homogenate of said transgenic_rodent
dependent claims add the limitations that the rodent is murine mouse and that the transgene is nonhomologously integrated

the claims of the ¡¬003_patent differ only in that they include a promoter and a polyadenylation site
claim 1 is representative 1
a transgenic_rodent_comprising
*1054 a diploid genome comprising a transgene comprising in operable linkage a promoter a dna segment encoding a heterologous_app_polypeptide and a polyadenlyation site wherein the app polypeptide has the swedish_mutation whereby the amino_acid residues at positions corresponding to positions 595_and_596 in human_app695 are asparagine and leucine respectively wherein the transgene is expressed to produce a human_app_polypeptide having the swedish_mutation and wherein said polypeptide is processed to atf-betaapp in a sufficient_amount to be detectable in a brain_homogenate of said transgenic_rodent
the mullan_reference was cited as prior_art in prosecution of the elan_patents and was distinguished upon amendment of the elan claims to include the claim clause that refers to production of atf-betaapp in detectable amounts in the rodent brain

i
the district_court granting mayos motion for summary_judgment held that the mullan_reference anticipates the elan_invention
whether an invention is anticipated is a question of fact
hoover group inc. v. custom metalcraft inc. 66_f.3d_299 302 36_uspq2d_1101 1103 fed.cir.1995
on appeal elan requests review of the district_courts determination that the mullan_reference anticipates the claims of the elan patent because the elan mouse is inherent in mullan
we conclude that elans arguments are more properly characterized as enablement arguments rather than inherency arguments

to serve as an anticipating reference the reference must enable that which it is asserted to anticipate
`` a claimed invention can not be anticipated by a prior_art_reference if the allegedly anticipatory disclosures cited as prior_art are not enabled'
amgen inc. v. hoechst marion roussel inc. 314_f.3d_1313 1354 65_uspq2d_1385 1416 fed.cir.2003
see bristol-myers squibb v. ben venue laboratories inc. 246_f.3d_1368 1374 58_uspq2d_1508 1512 fed.cir.2001` to anticipate the reference must also enable one of skill in the art to make and use the claimed invention
`` ; ppg industries inc. v. guardian industries corp. 75_f.3d_1558 1566 37_uspq2d_1618 1624 fed.cir.1996` to anticipate a claim a reference must disclose every element of the challenged claim and enable one skilled in the art to make the anticipating subject_matter`
review of elans opposition to mayos motion for summary_judgment shows that while elan purports to contest mayos motion on the grounds that the mullan_patent does not inherently anticipate the elan claimed mouse the language and factual basis of this argument encompass enablement

enablement requires that` the prior_art_reference must teach one of ordinary_skill in the art to make or carry out the claimed invention without undue_experimentation'
minnesota mining and manufacturing co. v. chemque inc. 303_f.3d_1294 1301 64_uspq2d_1270 1278 fed.cir.2002 ; enzo_biochem inc. v. calgene inc. 188_f.3d_1362 1369 52_uspq2d_1129 1134 fed.cir.1999` whether undue_experimentation would have been required to make and use an invention and thus whether a disclosure is enabling under 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
1 is a question of law that we review de novo based on underlying factual inquiries that we review for clear error
``

the factual premises of the enablement analysis for biological processes were addressed in in re wands 858_f.2d_731 8_uspq2d_1400_(fed.cir.1988) the court explaining *1055 that determination of whether the requisite amount of experimentation is undue may include consideration of 1 the quantity of experimentation necessary 2 the amount of direction or guidance presented 3 the presence or absence of working examples 4 the nature of the invention 5 the state of the prior_art 6 the relative skill of those in the art 7 the predictability or unpredictability of the art and 8 the breadth of the claims
id.at 737 8 uspq2d at 1404
see amgen inc. v. chugai pharm co. 927_f.2d_1200 1213 18_uspq2d_1016 1027 fed.cir.1991 discussing application of the wands_factors
in in re goodman 11_f.3d_1046 1052 29_uspq2d_2010 2015 fed.cir.1993 the wands_factors were applied to a gene transformation method the court finding that the method` would have required extensive experimentation that would preclude patentability'

the disclosure in an assertedly anticipating reference must be adequate to enable possession of the desired subject_matter
it is insufficient to name or describe the desired subject_matter if it can not be produced without undue_experimentation
the principles underlying application of the criteria of enablement to the content of the prior_art were discussed in in re donohue 766_f.2d_531 226_uspq_619_(fed.cir.1985) it is well settled that prior_art under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b must sufficiently describe the claimed invention to have placed the public in possession of it
such possession is effected if one of ordinary_skill in the art could have combined the publications description of the invention with his own knowledge to make the claimed invention
accordingly even if the claimed invention is disclosed in a printed publication that disclosure will not suffice as prior_art if it is not enabling
it is not however necessary that an invention disclosed in a publication shall have actually been made in order to satisfy the enablement requirement
id.at 533 766_f.2d_531 226 uspq at 621
see also in re borst 52_c.c.p.a._1398 345_f.2d_851 855 145_uspq_554 557 1962` the disclosure must be such as will give possession of the invention to the person of ordinary_skill
even the act of publication or the fiction of constructive reduction to practice will not suffice if the disclosure does not meet this standard
``

the determination of what level of experimentation is` undue' so as to render a disclosure non-enabling is made from the viewpoint of persons experienced in the field of the invention
see enzo_biochem 188 f.3d at 1373-74 discussing evidence of enablement and nonenablement in an unpredictable field of biotechnology
`` the determination of what constitutes undue_experimentation in a given case requires the application of a standard of reasonableness having due regard for the nature of the invention and the state of the art'
in re wands 858_f.2d_731 737 fed.cir.1988
in wands the court observed that` [ t ] he test is not merely quantitative since a considerable amount of experimentation is permissible if it is merely routine or if the specification in question provides a reasonable amount of guidance with respect to the direction in which the experimentation should proceed..' id. quoting ex parte jackson 217_uspq_804 817 1982_wl_51985_(bd.app.1982)

the mullan_reference contains an extensive description of the swedish mutated gene its source the nature of the mutation and its role in alzheimers disease
the reference also states that the invention provides a transgenic_animal whose *1056 cells contain the mutated gene and express the swedish mutated protein the invention also provides a transgenic non-human animal containing in a germ or somatic cell the mutated nucleic acid of the invention wherein the animal expresses a human amyloid precursor protein or fragment thereof which encodes an amino_acid other than lysine at codon 670 and/or an amino_acid other than methionine at codon 671
mullan col. 4 lines 35-40
elan argues that the mullan_reference does not show all of the limitations of the elan claims and does not enable the transgenic_animal it describes
elan stresses the uncertainty and difficulty of producing a transgenic_animal and argues that although mullan foresaw a transgenic_mouse and presented a compilation of known methods of gene transfer the reference does not teach or suggest which method might succeed in creating the desired mutated mouse
mayo in turn stresses the comprehensiveness of the mullan disclosure and that elan indeed eventually succeeded with one of the methods mentioned by mullan using the swedish gene discovered by mullan and a mouse species recited by mullan

the mullan_reference summarizes the various known gene transfer techniques with citations to scientific literature describing these techniques
the following extract is illustrative one approach to creating transgenic_animals is to target a mutation to the desired gene by homologous recombination in an embryonic stem es cell line in vitro followed by microinjection of the modified es cell line into a host blastocyst and subsequent incubation in a foster_mother see frohman and martin cell 1989 56:145
alternatively the technique of microinjection of the mutated gene or a portion thereof into a one-cell embryo followed by incubation in a foster_mother can be used
certain possibilities for the general use of transgenic_animals particularly transgenic_animals that express a wild-type app fragment are disclosed in wirak et_al. the embo journal 10 2 289-296 1991 ; schilling et_al. gene 98 2 225-230 1991 ; quon et_al

( 1991 science 253:323 ; and kawabata et_al
( 1991 nature 354:476
alternatively viral vectors e.g. adeno-associated virus can be used to deliver the mutated gene to the stem cell
in addition such viral vectors can be used to deliver the mutated gene to a developed animal and then used to screen mendelson et_al. virology 166:154-165 ; wondisford et_al

mullan col. 11 line 58 to col. 12 line 11
mullan states that site-directed mutagenesis can also be used preferably so as to produce the desired mutation
the mullan_reference also names various known cloning vectors for creation of transgenic_animals and states that the vector is` selected based on the size of the desired insert and the ability to produce stable chromosome integration'
the mullan_reference contains additional information with citations to scientific articles and textbooks proposing how vectors` can be constructed' the transgene` can be injected' and like statements

elan stresses that mullan does not suggest which if any of the methods and vectors he cites might reasonably be predicted to succeed in producing a mouse operatively harboring the swedish_mutation
as explained in enzo_biochem 188 f.3d at 1372` an enablement determination is made retrospectively i.e. by looking back to the filing date of the patent application and determining whether undue_experimentation would have been required to make and use the claimed invention *1057 at that time'
thus the enablement of the mullan and elan mice would be determined separately

the issue is not whether the mullan teachings are an accurate compilation of the state of the scientific art at that time and they are not challenged on that ground
the issue is whether his teachings enabled a person of ordinary_skill without undue_experimentation to produce the desired transgenic_mouse
the district_court did not directly address the question of enablement which was not the subject of the summary_judgment motion

thus we remand for determination by the district_court upon consideration of relevant evidence and upon application of the law to the facts of this case of whether the mullan_reference enabled persons of ordinary_skill in the field of the invention to make the desired mutated mouse without undue_experimentation

ii
this appeal was directed to the summary_judgment that was granted on the ground of anticipation
mayos other defenses of invalidity and the question of infringement were not reached by the district_court
mayos argument that the claims are invalid under ¡± 103 and/or ¡± 112 particularly if construed to have the breadth that elan ascribes to them in order to reach the mayo mouse and any other issues properly raised remain for consideration on remand

reversed and remanded
