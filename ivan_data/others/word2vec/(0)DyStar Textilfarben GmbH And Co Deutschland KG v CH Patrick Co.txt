the magistrate_judge did not issue an opinion
his order stated the jury diligently considered the evidence presented and found for the plaintiff
this court concludes that the jurys verdict was reasonable and was supported by evidence in the record
therefore as this court has great respect for trial by jury and the right of the parties to request a jury_trial this court will not substitute its findings for those of the jury as the jurys decision was clearly supported by the trial record and was reasonable
id

bann_appeals from the denials of its motions on anticipation and obviousness and the grant of jmol to dystar regarding inequitable_conduct
for the reasons explained below we reverse the district_courts denial of banns motion for jmol of invalidity of claims 1-4 for obviousness

i. indigo has been used in dyeing textile_materials for thousands of years
because indigo_pigment is insoluble in water it must be de-oxidized or` reduced' to a water-soluble white form known as` leuco_indigo' before it can be used in dyeing
leuco indigo is unstable ; it oxidizes and returns to its blue_pigment_form when exposed to oxygen
thus leuco_indigo_solution needs to be kept in an oxygen-free environment or otherwise stabilized if it is not being used immediately for dyeing

for many years dyehouses commonly reduced indigo in-house through a process known as hydrosulfite_reduction
dyers created a` stock_vat' in which indigo is reduced in water with sodium_hydrosulfite and solubilized with an alkali e.g. sodium_hydroxide
the resulting leuco_indigo_solution is then transferred into a feed tank and fed into the dyebath
after the dyebath is prepared the textile_material is dyed through a process known as` dipping' and` skying'
in` dipping' the textile_material is contacted with leuco_indigo in the dyebath ; in` skying' the dyed textile_material is introduced to the air causing the indigo to convert back to its blue_pigment_form

a second common method of indigo_reduction catalytic_hydrogenation was patented by andre brochet in 1917
see u.s. patent no._1247,927` brochet'
the superficial difference between hydrosulfite_reduction and catalytic_hydrogenation is that the latter uses gaseous hydrogen *1359 rather than sodium_hydrosulfite as a reducing agent
catalytic hydrogenation allowed` economical production of concentrated solutions of leuco derivatives free from impurities and mineral_salts' ; when left to settle the solution naturally separates from nickel or another catalytic metal and can be` drawn off and is ready for use'
brochet ll.88-90 109-110
most important to the dyehouses however was the fact that brochets leuco_indigo_solution could be stabilized in solid_form usually powder or paste and coated with molasses or glue to protect the reduced indigo from air and prevent premature oxidation
this allowed the indigo_reduction process to shift out of the dyehouses and into chemical_manufacturers which began to produce and sell prereduced indigo to dyehouses in the early 1900s
rather than create a stock_vat dyers needed only to dissolve the prereduced indigo into a preparation_tank add caustic_soda i.e. sodium_hydroxide and sodium_hydrosulfite to remove oxygen from the water and transfer the resulting solution from the preparation_tank to the dyebath
this significantly reduced the time necessary to prepare a dyebath the dyehouses expenditures on sodium_hydrosulfite and caustic_soda and the level of pollution in dyehouse waste water and on dyehouse floors

the process of dyeing textile_materials with catalytically hydrogenated leuco_indigo traditionally has involved six steps 1 reducing indigo to its leuco_form in solution ; 2 stabilizing the leuco_indigo_solution usually in paste or powder_form ; 3 creating a preparation_tank in which the dried leuco_indigo is re-converted to solution_form ; 4 adding the solution to the dyebath ; 5 dipping ; and 6 skying

claim 1 of the ¡¬992_patent the only independent claim at issue recites a process for dyeing cellulose-containing textile_material with indigo which comprises
a introducing into a dyebath an aqueous_solution of leuco_indigo_solution prepared by catalytic_hydrogenation ; b contacting the textile_material with the dyebath ; and after the leuco_indigo has gone onto the textile_material c converting said leuco_indigo back into the pigment form in a conventional manner by air oxidation
'992_patent col.6 l.66-col.7 l.6
the ¡¬992_patent thus improved upon the prior_art by eliminating steps two and three of the traditional process stabilizing the leuco_indigo_solution into a paste or powder_form and then reconstituting the solution in a preparation_tank
instead it allowed a dyer to pour prereduced indigo_solution directly into a dyebath and commence dyeing immediately

ii
bann_appeals from the denials of its motions on anticipation of claim 1 and obviousness of claims 1-4 and the grant of dystars jmol of no inequitable_conduct
we review decisions on motions for jmol and motions for a new_trial under the law of the regional circuit

`` the question is whether a jury viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to [ dystar ] could have properly reached the conclusion reached by this *1360 jury
we must reverse if a reasonable jury could only rule in favor of [ bann ] ; if reasonable minds could differ we must affirm'

( internal citation and quotation marks omitted
the denial of a motion for a new_trial is reviewed in the fourth_circuit for abuse of discretion
united_states v. perry 335_f.3d_316 320 4th cir.2003

bann asserts that claim 1 of the ¡¬992_patent is invalid because it is anticipated by brochet
bann further argues that claims 1-4 are invalid as obvious in light of brochet and certain other prior_art including two pre-1917 basf patents-united_states patent nos._820900` wimmer' and 885,978` chaumat' a post-world war ii report of the british intelligence objectives sub-committee` bios report' and the 1936 manual for the dyeing of cotton and other vegtable fibres` manual` published by general dyestuff corporation
we address the broader argument relating to obviousness first

a
a determination that a claimed invention would have been obvious and thus the patent issued thereon invalid is a legal_conclusion that we review de novo
richardson-vicks inc. v. upjohn co. 122_f.3d_1476 1479 fed.cir.1997
we must determine` if the differences between the subject_matter sought to be patented and the prior_art are such that the subject_matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary_skill in the art to which said subject_matter pertains'
35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a
we thus consider whether a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have been motivated to combine the prior_art to achieve the claimed invention and whether there would have been a reasonable expectation of success in doing so
brown & williamson tobacco corp. v. philip morris inc. 229_f.3d_1120 1124 fed.cir.2000

underpinning this legal inquiry are four groups of factual_findings which in a jury_trial we review for substantial_evidence
richardson-vicks 122 f.3d at 1479
following the 1952 enactment of ¡± 103 the supreme_court explained that obviousness depends on 1 the scope and content of the prior_art ; 2 the differences between the claimed invention and the prior_art ; 3 the level of ordinary_skill in the art ; and 4 any relevant secondary_considerations including commercial_success long felt but unsolved needs and failure of others

sibia_neurosciences inc. v. cadus pharma corp. 225_f.3d_1349 1356 fed.cir.2000
where as here all claim_limitations are found in a number of prior_art_references the factfinder must determine` [ w ] hat the prior_art teaches whether it teaches away from the claimed invention and whether it motivates a combination of teachings from different_references'
in re fulton 391_f.3d_1195 1199-1200 fed.cir.2004
it is important in this inquiry to distinguish between the references sought to be combined and` the prior_art' as the latter category is much broader
for example textbooks or treatises may include basic principles unlikely to be restated in cited references

lexis 22616 at *6 quoting graham 383 u.s. at 36 86_s.ct._684

in contrast to the characterization of some commentators the suggestion_test is not a rigid categorical rule
the motivation need not be found in the references sought to be combined but may be found in any number of sources including common_knowledge the prior_art as a whole or the nature of the problem itself
in re dembiczak 175_f.3d_994 999 fed.cir.1999
as we explained in motorola inc. v. interdigital tech corp. 121_f.3d_1461 1472 fed.cir.1997` there is no requirement that the prior_art contain an express_suggestion to combine known elements to achieve the claimed invention
rather the suggestion to combine may come from the prior_art as filtered through the knowledge of one skilled in the art'

for one to conclude that the invention of the ¡¬992_patent would have been obvious then the prior_art common_knowledge or the nature of the problem viewed through the eyes of an ordinary_artisan must have suggested the following steps 1 creating leuco_indigo_solution through catalytic_hydrogenation ; 2 stabilizing the leuco_indigo in solution_form ; 3 adding the leuco_indigo_solution directly into a dyebath ; 4 dipping ; and 5 skying
because the jury did not make explicit factual_findings in the form of answers to written interrogatories or special verdicts we must discern the jurys implied factual_findings by interpreting the evidence consistently with the verdict and drawing all reasonable inferences in dystars favor
konkel v. bob evans farms inc. 165_f.3d_275 279 4th cir.1999

b. banns obviousness_argument rests primarily on three u.s. patents brochet wimmer and chaumat
brochet is directed to` the manufacture of leuco derivatives of vat_dyestuffs' generally of which indigo is one
brochet ll.6-7
by its plain_language brochet discloses the process of preparing an aqueous_solution of leuco_indigo by catalytic_hydrogenation
there can be no serious dispute that the ultimate use of a` dyestuff' is dyeing textile_materials ; indeed the ¡¬992_patent inventor georg schnitzer testified that leuco_indigo_solutions were known to be used in 1917 for dyeing and dr. richard blackburn one of dystars technical experts testified that basf began reducing indigo with catalytic_hydrogenation and selling the reduced indigo to dyehouses in 1926
moreover both parties agree that dipping and skying were well known in the art
as explained supra when indigo is reduced in-house in a stock_vat the resulting leuco_indigo_solution is introduced directly into the dyebath without first being stabilized through drying
thus the critical issue in our obviousness analysis is whether stabilizing catalytically reduced leuco_indigo in solution_form rather than in powder_form coated with molasses for example renders the claimed process nonobvious to one of ordinary_skill in the art

1
level of ordinary skill in the art
because the parties disagree over the relevance of the cited prior_art which *1362 fundamentally is a disagreement over the level of ordinary_skill in the art we address this third graham factor first
dystar asserts that we must disregard brochet wimmer and chaumat because a person of ordinary_skill in the art would not be aware of these references
in short dystar argues that no knowledge of chemistry is required in the relevant technical field

dystar points to testimony from dr._blackburn that` [ a ] person of ordinary_skill in the art is a dyer' someone with` a high school degree' who is` able to read and write' but whose knowledge is limited to` flipping the switches' on the machine
dr._blackburn also testified however that a person of ordinary_skill in the art was` running the dye_processes' which required inter_alia` doing the calculations'
when confronted with the inconsistency between his testimony regarding the applicable level of skill during cross-examination dr._blackburn stated that` its difficult to say' which of the two skill levels should be applied to the obviousness inquiry
dr._blackburn explained that` those people may do both jobs' but concluded by stating` i think the former [ i.e. the personflipping the switches ]' is the ordinary_artisan
thus the jury had evidence before it of two potential levels of ordinary_skill 1 that of a dyer and 2 that of a person creating the dye_processes who we will refer to as a dyeing process_designer

dystar presented evidence that the application of vat_dyes a book by the american_association of textile_chemists and colorists teaches people how to dye and is a text that a dyer would have had at the time of the ¡¬992_patent invention
dr. nolan etters banns expert witness agreed that` a person of ordinary_skill in the art' would be a member of the american_association of textile_chemists and colorists and conceded that none of the prior_art cited by bann is referenced in the application of vat_dyes

we agree with dystar that we are required to assume the jury accepted its argument that a person of ordinary_skill in the art is a dyer with no knowledge of chemistry
because the jury heard testimony that the prior_art cited by bann was directed toward chemists not dyers the jury must have found the prior_art cited by bann neither in the relevant art nor analogous_arts and then consistent with the limited evidence of prior_art deemed relevant concluded that the process claimed in the ¡¬992_patent would not have been obvious

however substantial_evidence does not support the jurys finding that a person of ordinary_skill is a dyer with no knowledge of chemistry
indeed that factual finding is inconsistent with the ¡¬992_patents very purpose
the technical problem that the process of the ¡¬992_patent and the prior_art cited by bann sought to solve is precisely the same an improved process for dyeing textile_materials with indigo
this process includes several discrete subcomponents-e.g. indigo_reduction and dyebath preparation-and an ordinary_artisan would be concerned with all of them
to beneficially practice the dyeing process claimed in the ¡¬992_patent the ordinary_artisan must have a higher-level perspective as he must first decide whether it is more efficient to reduce indigo in-house or purchase prereduced indigo and if prereduced must then decide whether solid or solution_form is preferable

designing an optimal_dyeing_process requires knowledge of chemistry and systems_engineering for example and by no means can be undertaken by a person of only high school education whose skill set is limited to` flipping the switches'
this is especially true when one considers that only in the last century have improvements *1363 in indigo_reduction chemistry enabled outsourcing of the indigo_reduction step from dyehouses to chemical_manufacturers ; prior to that simplification there would have been no question that a dyer would also require knowledge of indigo_reduction
because for this patent the only finding supported by substantial_evidence is that an ordinary_artisan is not a dyer but a person designing an optimal_dyeing_process the jurys implicit finding of a mere_dyer can not withstand scrutiny on jmol
accordingly the jurys apparent decision to disregard brochet wimmer and chaumat and perhaps other prior_art_references as neither in the dye process art nor even in analogous_arts is unsupported by substantial_evidence

2
scope and content of prior art
where as here claim_limitations are found in a combination of prior_art_references the factfinder must determine` [ w ] hat the prior_art teaches whether it teaches away from the claimed invention and whether it motivates a combination of teachings from different_references'
fulton 391 f.3d at 1199-1200 fed.cir.2004

to support its argument that an ordinary_artisan-i.e. a dyeing process_designer-would have known to attempt to stabilize the brochet_solution in oxygen-excluding conditions for addition directly into a dyebath bann points to two pre-brochet basf patents
wimmer issued in 1906 discloses a leuco_indigo_solution that` can be filtered and the filtrate which contains a high_percentage of indigo white can be placed on the market without any further_treatment' in contrast to reduction using zinc which required the solution` to be separated before the solution can be used for dyeing'
wimmer ll.34-40
chaumat issued in 1908 discloses a leuco_indigo_solution that` may be drawn off protected from the air and preserved indefinitely in receptacles which are either soldered or closed in any other_hermetic_manner'
chaumat ll.84-87
although wimmer and chaumat disclose different reducing methods than brochet-wimmer suggests the use of iron rather than zinc as a reducing agent and chaumat discloses an electrolytic process for indigo_reduction-bann argues that once the indigo has been converted to its leuco_form the distinction is irrelevant for dyeing purposes
accordingly bann argues that this prior_art would teach an ordinary_artisan in the field of indigo dyeing process design to attempt to stabilize any leuco_indigo_solution however reduced for addition directly into the dyebath

a
what does the prior_art teach ?
dystar argues that because wimmer and chaumat involve different methods of reducing indigo they are nonanalogous art and properly disregarded by the jury
in support of this assertion mr._schnitzer testified that up until the time of the invention basfs` people from production' believed that leuco_indigo created from catalytic_hydrogenation was too unstable to be added directly to the dyebath and might` stain the yarn with indigo_pigment' or` block [ ] pipes'
dystar offered evidence that prior to the ¡¬992_patent basf had limited its sales of catalytically hydrogenated leuco_indigo to that stabilized in paste or solid_form
thus argues dystar the language in wimmer and chaumat suggesting that the solution could be stabilized and sold in solution_form does not apply to catalytically hydrogenated leuco_indigo_solution

we disagree
as explained supra the proper focus is on the indigo dyeing process as a whole which requires the ordinary_artisan to consider and choose between the various indigo_reduction methods
the ¡¬992_patent is directed toward *1364 a process of dyeing with indigo and although a specific method of reduction is required by claim 1 the first step in the process requires indigo in prereduced form
it is undisputed that reduced indigo by any reduction method not just catalytic_hydrogenation has been used in the indigo dyeing process
the prior_art involving indigo_reduction by other_methods is thus not merely analogous art it is the same art
accordingly all limitations recited by claim 1 of the ¡¬992_patent -including the immediate_use of leuco_indigo_solution for dyeing-are contained in the prior_art.2

b
does the prior_art teach away from the claimed invention ?
we reject dystars assertion that contemporaneous_articles by wimmer and brochet teach away from the combination of brochet and chaumat and thus the claimed process
dystar acknowledges that no specific language in these references teaches away from the invention of the ¡¬992_patent
rather because these references do not discuss the stabilization of leuco_indigo_solution in solution_form for immediate addition to a dyebath dystar somehow concludes that these references teach that leuco_indigo_solution` can not be used to dye but is instead useful only as an intermediate'

although wimmers contemporaneous_article only describes the use of indigo_solution as an intermediate product he does not retract his patent language indicating that` the solution can be filtered and the filtrate which contains a high_percentage of indigo white can be placed on the market without any further_treatment'
wimmer ll.33-37
likewise the brochet patent directed toward all vat_dyestuffs broadly teaches that the process` produce [ s ] mother-liquors which can be diluted immediately before use or be treated by evaporation under reduced pressure or by any other means to obtain concentrated products for sale'
brochet ll.66-70
this language implies that all vat_dyestuffs including indigo may either be used immediately for dyeing or concentrated prior to sale
in his contemporaneous_article brochet stated that his catalytically hydrogenated solution could be used` economically to obtain concentrated indigo white [ i.e. leuco_indigo ] solutions that are free of impurities and alkaline salts that can be concentrated in vacuum in order to obtain white indigo as a paste'
this mere failure to discuss immediate_use of his leuco_indigo_solution for dyeing is not the same_thing as brochet stating in his article that though most dyestuffs may be used immediately or stored in oxygen-excluding containers his leuco_indigo_solution may only be concentrated in paste form
we will not read into a reference a teaching away from a process where no such language exists

c. is there a motivation to combine ?
dystar argues that this courts` suggestion_test' for obviousness requires the cited references themselves to contain a suggestion teaching or motivation to combine them and that it must be explicitly stated
dystar then points out correctly that brochet does not suggest combining his invention with those of chaumat or wimmer to stabilize his leuco_indigo_solution in oxygen-excluding containers until either using it directly in the dyebath or placing it on the market for sale respectively
*1365 absent such a teaching urges dystar the invention of claim 1 of the ¡¬992_patent can not be obvious

dystars argument misreads this courts cases and misdescribes our suggestion_test echoing notions put forth recently by various commentators and accepted in major reports
a 2003 report by the federal trade commission for example quoted testimony of certain witnesses that this court requires` specific and definitive [ prior ] art references with clear motivation of how to combine those references' and requires the pto to find` the glue expressly leading you all the way [ to obviousness ]' and` connect the dots.. very very clearly'

similarly a 2004 report by the national academy of sciences summarized views of a few_commentators that` standards of patentability-especially the non-obviousness standard-have become too lax as a result of court decisions' by the federal_circuit leading to the deterioration of patent quality
nat l research council a patent_system for the 21st_century 3 stephen a. merrill et al
eds. 2004
but see am
intellectual prop
law ass n aipla response to the national academies report entitled` a patent_system for the 21st_century' 10 2004` aipla believes that the courts including the federal_circuit have applied the standard of non-obviousness with both the needed rigor and the appropriate vigor and they have done so with a commendable consistency over the past two decades
if a difficulty exists with application of the non-obviousness standard today it does not lie in the patent statute or in substantive law of non-obviousness as applied in the courts'

seeking to support their assertions about federal_circuit caselaw these few_commentators have quoted isolated statements from three of our precedents in particular including dembiczak 175 f.3d at 1000 wherein we stated that the analysis by the board of patent appeals and interferences` board'` fails to demonstrate how the [ two cited ] references teach or suggest their combination' emphasis added and in re lee 277_f.3d_1338 1341 1344 fed.cir.2002 where we characterized the boards statement that` [ t ] he conclusion of obviousness may be made from common_knowledge and common_sense of a person of ordinary_skill in the art without any specific_hint or suggestion in a particular_reference' as` [ o ] mission of a relevant factor required by precedent'
they have also cited our repeated use of the word` references' in the following list from ruiz v. a.b
chance co. 234_f.3d_654_(fed.cir.2000) where we suggested a motivation to combine may be found 1 in the prior_art_references themselves ; 2 in the knowledge of those of ordinary_skill in the art that certain references or disclosures in those references are of special interest or importance in the field ; or
3 from the nature of the problem to be solved leading inventors to look to references relating to possible solutions to that problem
id.at 665 emphasis added internal_quotation_marks omitted

despite containing arguably imprecise language in these statements quoted out of context each of the above-cited cases correctly applies the suggestion_test and by no means requires an explicit_teaching to combine to be found in a particular prior_art_reference
dembiczak involved the combination of a reference in the plastic trash bag art with childrens arts and crafts books that included among innumerable fanciful drawings jack-o-lanterns
*1366 contrary to some interpretations we stated explicitly that evidence of a motivation to combine need not be found in the prior_art_references themselves but rather may be found in` the knowledge of one of ordinary_skill in the art or in some cases from the nature of the problem to be solved'
175 f.3d at 999 citation omitted
when not from the prior_art_references the` evidence' of motive will likely consist of an explanation of the well-known principle or problem-solving strategy to be applied
our analysis in dembiczak focused on an explicit_teaching in the prior_art not because our case_law requires it but because the board had stated that` the [ two cited ] references would have suggested the application of.. facial indicia to the prior_art plastic trash bags'
id.at 1000 emphasis added
we held the boards obviousness determination legally insufficient because in addition to failing to make graham findings the boards analysis was` limited to a discussion of the ways that the multiple prior_art_references can be combined to read on the claimed invention'` rather than pointing to specific information in [ the two references ] that suggest the combination'
id
on appeal to this court the commissioner of patents and trademarks attempted to defend the board decision by laying out using the graham factors a clear-and likely affirmable-rationale establishing the level of ordinary_skill and explaining the motivation to combine
id.at 1001
we declined to consider these arguments newly raised on appeal stating that they did` little more than highlight the shortcomings of the decision below'
id

in ruiz as in dembiczak we vacated a conclusion of obviousness because the factfinder failed to make graham factor findings
234 f.3d at 660
far from requiring evidence of an explicit motivation to combine we suggested in ruiz that there may have existed an implicit_motivation to combine based on testimony that the invention was an improvement over the prior_art because it is` easy to install' and` low_cost'
id.at 666
we explained that such` [ e ] vidence which suggests that the combination of two references would suggest the resulting improvement is one way in which to determine a reason suggestion or motivation to combine' and instructed the district_court to consider the evidence on remand

likewise a close reading of in re lee reveals that our objection was not to the boards statement that` [ t ] he conclusion of obviousness may be made from common_knowledge and common_sense of a person of ordinary_skill in the art without any specific_hint or suggestion in a particular_reference' but its utter failure to explain the` common_knowledge and common_sense' on which it relied
see 277 f.3d at 1341 1344
lee involved a patent combining a prior_art video game instruction handbook describing a` demonstration_mode' with a prior_art television set having a menu display allowing video and audio adjustments
the board without comment adopted the examiners answer which merely stated that the combination of the two cited references`would have been obvious to one of ordinary_skill in the art since the demonstration_mode is just a programmable feature which can be used in many different devices for providing automatic introduction by adding the proper programming software and thatanother motivation would be that the automatic demonstration_mode is user friendly and it functions as a tutorial
`` id.at 1341
we explained that` [ c ] onclusory statements such as those here provided do not fulfill the agencys obligation' to explain all material facts relating to a motivation to combine
id.at 1344
in other words we instructed the board to explain why` common_sense' of an ordinary_artisan *1367 seeking to solve the problem at hand would have led him to combine the references
we noted that our predecessor court held more than thirty years earlier that` common_knowledge and common_sense' were sufficient to establish a motivation to combine in re bozek 57_c.c.p.a._713 416_f.2d_1385_(1969) and distinguished that case because in bozek the examiner first` established that this knowledge was in the art'
id.at 1390
we instructed that assumptions about common_sense can not substitute for evidence thereof as the board attempted to do in lee
277 f.3d at 1345 ; see also in re zurko 258_f.3d_1379 1383 1385 fed.cir.2001 reversing as unsupported by substantial_evidence a finding of motivation to combine cited references where the board adopted examiners unsupported assertion that claim_limitation missing from cited references was` basic_knowledge' and it` would have been nothing more than good common_sense' to combine the references and explaining that` [ t ] his assessment of basic_knowledge and common_sense was not based on any evidence in the record' ; in re rouffet 149_f.3d_1350 1357 fed.cir.1998 affirming finding of high_level of ordinary_skill and the boards explanation as to why cited reference implicitly would suggest missing claim_limitation to ordinary_artisan but reversing its reliance on high_level of ordinary_skill as basis of motivation to combine and stating` the board did not however explain what specific_understanding or technological principle within the knowledge of one of ordinary_skill in the art would have suggested the combination
instead the board merely invoked the high_level of skill in the field of art
if such a rote invocation could suffice to supply a motivation to combine the more sophisticated scientific fields would rarely if ever experience a patentable technical advance
``

it is difficult to see how our suggestion_test could be seen as rigid and categorical given the myriad cases over several decades in which panels of this court have applied the suggestion_test flexibly
obviousness is a complicated subject requiring sophisticated analysis and no single case lays out all facets of the legal test
dystars argument and the above-cited commentary highlight the danger inherent in focusing on isolated dicta rather than gleaning the law of a particular area from careful reading of the full text of a group of related precedents for all they say that is dispositive and for what they hold
when parties like dystar do not engage in such careful candid and complete legal analysis much confusion about the law arises and through time can be compounded.3

our suggestion_test is in actuality quite flexible and not only permits but requires consideration of common_knowledge and common_sense
see e.g. in re kotzab 217_f.3d_1365 1369 fed.cir.2000` a critical step in analyzing the patentability of claims pursuant to section 103 a is casting *1368 the mind back to the time of invention to consider the thinking of one of ordinary_skill in the art guided only by the prior_art_references and the then-accepted wisdom in the field
`` ; motorola 121 f.3d at 1472` [ t ] he suggestion to combine may come from the prior_art as filtered through the knowledge of one skilled in the art
`` ; bozek 416 f.2d at 1390` having established that this knowledge was in the art the examiner could then properly rely as put forth by the solicitor on a conclusion of obviousnessfrom common_knowledge and common_sense of the person of ordinary_skill in the art without any specific_hint or suggestion in a particular_reference
``

indeed we have repeatedly held that an implicit_motivation to combine exists not only when a suggestion may be gleaned from the prior_art as a whole but when the` improvement' is technology-independent and the combination of references results in a product or process that is more desirable for example because it is stronger cheaper cleaner faster lighter smaller more durable or more efficient
because the desire to enhance commercial opportunities by improving a product or process is universal-and even common-sensical-we have held that there exists in these situations a motivation to combine prior_art_references even absent any hint of suggestion in the references themselves
in such situations the proper question is whether the ordinary_artisan possesses knowledge and skills rendering him capable of combining the prior_art_references

in pro-mold & tool_co. inc. v. great lakes plastics inc. 75_f.3d_1568_(fed.cir.1996) for example we analyzed asserted obviousness of a claimed invention of a sports trading card holder only slightly larger than the trading card
we stated that` [ w ] e start from the self-evident proposition that mankind in particular inventors strive to improve that which already exists'
id.at 1573
we required no documentary evidence of motive
we explained that the motivation to combine` a reference describing an elegant card holder and cover arrangement with a reference describing a card holder no larger than necessary to enclose the card.. was thus evident from the very size of the card itself
`` 4 id.at 1573
because an ornamental card holder just large enough to enclose the card would be more efficient there existed an implicit indeed common-sensical motivation to combine the two references

similarly in sandt tech. ltd. v. resco metal & plastics corp. 264_f.3d_1344 1355 fed.cir.2001 we held invalid for obviousness a patent claim for a stainless steel cover for pay telephones
the only relevant difference between the claimed invention and the prior_art covers was that the former attached the steel cover to the telephone via studs and the latter attached it with welds
id
we noted that the difference between attaching with welds and studs was merely a` slight variation that produced convenience'
id
we found a clear motive to alter the prior_art welded cover simply because` [ u ] sing studs was a cheaper faster and more convenient method of attachment' id. absent even a hint of suggestion to combine

in mazzari v. rogan 323_f.3d_1000_(fed.cir.2003) we affirmed a district_court grant of summary_judgment of invalidity for obviousness of a patent claiming the use of underwater acoustic waves to kill zebra_mussels
the board had upheld the rejection of an application based on two prior_art patents an acoustic wave generator *1369 that enabled altering wave intensity and focusing acoustic_energy along a particular angle and a method of using water-borne acoustic waves to kill zebra_mussels
the board held that a motivation to combine the two references existed because an ordinary_artisan would have been aware of both references and that combination of the two was` more efficient'
id.at 1002-03
the inventor then brought a civil suit against the director of the pto pursuant to 35 u.s.c.¡± 145 and the district_court granted summary_judgment in favor of the director
we deemed sufficient the boards explanation of a motivation to combine and affirmed` because the references illustrate that it is well known in the art to use acoustic_energy to kill and repel zebra_mussels'
id.at 1006 ; see also ruiz 234 f.3d at 666 remanding for determination of whether testimony that claimed invention was` easy to install' and` low_cost' established motivation to combine

in situations where a motivation to combine is based on these principles the invention can not be said to be nonobvious
our precedent on this point moreover is consistent with the supreme_courts holdings in graham and three other obviousness decisions pre-dating the establishment of this court
see sakraida v. ag_pro inc. 425_u.s._273 282 96_s.ct._1532 47_l.ed.2d_784_(1976) ; anderson's-black_rock inc. v. pavement salvage co. 396_u.s._57 90_s.ct._305 24_l.ed.2d_258_(1969) ; united_states v. adams 383_u.s._39 86_s.ct._708 15_l.ed.2d_572_(1966)

in anderson's-black_rock the supreme_court held invalid for obviousness a patent covering 1 a radiant burner for heating asphalt 2 attached to the front of a standard asphalt-paving machine
both elements were well-known in the prior_art individually with the difference being that previously radiant-heat burners were not used in paving but merely for patching limited areas of asphalt
396 u.s. at 58-59 90_s.ct._305
because asphalt is usually laid sequentially in parallel strips the adjoining strip cools before the next strip is laid leading to what is known as a` cold_joint' -an area of poor bonding into which water and dirt enter causing deterioration
id.at 57-58 90_s.ct._305
by reheating the adjoining edge of the earlier-laid strip as a new strip is laid the invention sought to eliminate the cold_joint
no explicit suggestion to combine the prior_art_references would have been necessary because the invention merely improved the efficiency of the already-known process of laying pavement through the already-known method of merging two sections of asphalt through re-heating the earlier laid section-both of which would have been common_knowledge to ordinary_artisans in the field of laying asphalt
see also graham 383 u.s. at 24-25 86_s.ct._684 holding invalid for obviousness grahams patent disclosing a spring clamp on a plow shank where claimed invention merely improved mechanical weakness in prior graham patent because ordinary_artisan would have had mechanical skills sufficient to` immediately see that the thing to do was what graham did' ; id.at 36-37 86_s.ct._684 holding invalid for obviousness cook chemicals patent disclosing a plastic finger sprayer with a` hold-down' lid serving as a built-in dispenser for bottles of liquid products where differences from prior_art were` exceedingly small and quite nontechnical' and device was` old in the art'

likewise in sakraida the supreme_court held invalid for obviousness a patent for a barn having` a paved sloped barn_floor with downhill_drains'` elevated' cow stalls and a` dam' behind which water may be stored and abruptly released in order to` send a sheet of water cascading through the dairy sweeping the manure to the downhill_drains'
ag_pro inc. v. sakraida *1370 474_f.2d_167 168 5th cir.1973 quoting u.s. patent no._3223,070 revd by 425_u.s._273 96_s.ct._1532 47_l.ed.2d_784
because the cleaning action from an uphill release of water was superior to that from a hose the claimed invention reduced the quantity of water necessary to clean the barn_floor and obviated additional hand labor e.g. brooms or shovels shortening the cleaning process from a few hours to a few minutes
id
the supreme_court nonetheless negated patent protection characterizing the invention as` the work of the skillful mechanic not that of the inventor'
sakraida 425 u.s. at 279 96_s.ct._1532 internal_quotation_marks omitted
the court aptly noted that` [ e ] xploitation of the principle of gravity adds nothing to the sum of useful knowledge'
id
under this courts case_law there would have been no need for` evidence' of a motivation to combine a prior_art_reference with a universally-known physical principle to achieve more powerful and simultaneous sweep of water

in adams a companion case to graham the supreme_court upheld the validity of a patent for a non-rechargeable water-activated battery having magnesium and cuprous chloride electrodes
adams 383 u.s. at 51 86_s.ct._708
the court recognized that` each of the elements of the adams battery was well known in the prior_art' but rejected the united_states obviousness_argument because the prior_art taught away from the adams patents combination
as the court succinctly stated to combine [ the references ] as did adams required that a person reasonably skilled in the prior_art must ignore that 1 batteries which continued to operate on an open circuit and which heated in normal use were not practical ; and 2 water-activated batteries were successful only when combined with electrolytes detrimental to the use of magnesium
id.at 51-52 86_s.ct._708
the court instructed that such` known disadvantages in old devices.. may be taken into account in determining obviousness' id.at 52 86_s.ct._708 and we have incorporated this notion into our case_law
see e.g. fulton 391 f.3d at 1199-1200 instructing the factfinder to determine` [ w ] hat the prior_art teaches whether it teaches away from the claimed invention and whether it motivates a combination of teachings from different_references'

although this court customarily discusses a motivation to combine as part of the first_graham_factor the scope and content of the prior_art see sibia_neurosciences 225 f.3d at 1356 motivation to combine is also inextricably linked to the level of ordinary_skill
if as is usually the case no prior_art_reference contains an express_suggestion to combine references then the level of ordinary_skill will often predetermine whether an implicit suggestion exists
persons of varying degrees of skill not only possess varying bases of knowledge they also possess varying levels of imagination and ingenuity in the relevant field particularly with respect to problem-solving abilities
if the level of skill is low for example that of a mere_dyer as dystar has suggested then it may be rational to assume that such an artisan would not think to combine references absent explicit direction in a prior_art_reference
if however as we have held as a matter of law the level of skill is that of a dyeing process_designer then one can assume comfortably that such an artisan will draw ideas from chemistry and systems_engineering-without being told to do so

a dyeing process_designer would have been aware that reducing leuco_indigo in-house was time-consuming as well as expensive and that it created much pollution *1371 on the dyehouse floor and in public sewers
he would have known that purchasing solid prereduced indigo would save time space and money dyers would no longer spend time creating stock_vats and the dyehouse would require far less hydrosulfite and caustic_soda
a dyeing process_designer reading chaumat would have learned that leuco_indigo_solution` may be drawn off protected from the air and preserved indefinitely in receptacles which are either soldered or closed in any other_hermetic_manner'
chaumat ll.84-87
from his chemistry background he would have known how to close off a receptacle hermetically
he would have known that if he could thus stabilize leuco_indigo_solution he would save even more time space and money dyers would no longer need stock_vats or preparation_tanks because they could simply pour the prereduced solution directly into the dyebath itself and they would no longer need to purchase any hydrosulfite or caustic_soda
a dyeing process_designer reading brochet would have realized that catalytic_hydrogenation provided advantages over other_methods of indigo_reduction in that the leuco_indigo was` free from impurities and mineral_salts'
brochet l.90
naturally then an ordinary_artisan with knowledge of chaumat reading brochet would have realized that by stabilizing catalytic hydrogenated leuco_indigo_solution in oxygen-excluding containers he could devise a` cheaper faster and more convenient' indigo dyeing process
see sandt 264 f.3d at 1355
although the ¡¬992_patent claimed a new more efficient way of performing a known function dyeing indigo-the asserted innovation storing leuco_indigo_solution in airtight containers for immediate_use in dyebaths is merely` exploitation' of the well-known principle of vacuum packaging
see sakraida 425 u.s. at 279 96_s.ct._1532
in sum it is the work of a skilled chemist not of an inventor

3
secondary considerations of nonobviousness
the presence of certain secondary_considerations of nonobviousness are insufficient as a matter of law to overcome our conclusion that the evidence only supports a legal_conclusion that claim 1 would have been obvious
to be sure the jury heard testimony that dystar has enjoyed considerable commercial_success from the introduction of its product and all parties agree that eighty years elapsed between brochets invention and another inventors thought to vacuum-seal the brochet_solution and add it directly to the dyebath
however mr._schnitzers testimony that basfs` people from production' -who we here assume arguendo were dyeing process_designers-believed that leuco_indigo_solution added directly to the dyebath might` stain the yarn with indigo_pigment' or` block [ ] pipes' was a bare assertion that is not only undocumented and non-specific but also unsupported by even a brief explanation of the chemistry underlying this assumption
as such it does not constitute substantial_evidence of a secondary_consideration favoring nonobviousness

moreover another secondary_consideration cited by dystar-i.e. failed attempts-actually detracts from its argument and heavily so
dystar points out that another chemical company buffalo color abandoned a 1979 effort to market a prereduced indigo_solution made by hydrosulfite_reduction
the record shows however that buffalo was only mildly concerned with instability problems-it noted only that the instability of leuco_indigo` would require special and costly shipping conditions to protect it from oxidation'
rather buffalo decided against selling a leuco_indigo_solution because it would involve increased shipping costs might require customers to invest in additional *1372 storage facilities and would cost more to produce likely forcing it to increase prices to customers
buffalos decision was thus not a failed attempt but a calculated business judgment to abandon a potential new product line

c. our inquiry does not end here however because we must evaluate obviousness on a claim-by-claim basis
dayco prods. inc. v. total containment inc. 329_f.3d_1358 1370 fed.cir.2003` [ d ] ependent or multiple dependent claims shall be presumed valid even though dependent upon an invalid claim
``

claims 2-4 depend from process claim 1
claim 2 requires that the resulting solution contain from 10 % to 35 % by weight of leuco_indigo ; claim 3 requires that the solution contain from 2 % to 10 % by weight of alkali ; and claim 4 requires that the solution contain from 2 % to 10 % by weight of sodium_hydroxide
dr._blackburn dystars own expert witness confirmed that the plain_language of wimmer sets forth a` 30 percent aqueous_solution of leuco_indigo' which falls within the range prescribed by claim 2
dr._blackburn also testified that the solution disclosed by wimmer contains` 5.1 percent' by weight of alkali-the claim language says` at least six and a half percent' both of which fall between 2 % and 10 % as required by claim 3
likewise wimmer indicates that his example solution uses` naoh' sodium_hydroxide and mr._schnitzer agreed with banns counsels assertion that the term` caustic' is` chemically the same_thing as sodium_hydroxide' which meets the requirement of claim 4
dystar does not dispute these concessions on appeal
thus given dystars testimony and the plain_language of wimmer claims 2-4 do not recite a nonobvious invention beyond that recited in claim 1
accordingly claims 2-4 must also be held invalid for obviousness as a matter of law

iii
in sum because an ordinary_artisan is a person designing an optimal textile dyeing process with some expertise in chemistry the jurys implicit finding that the level of ordinary_skill in the art is a dyer is unsupported by substantial_evidence ; its corresponding decision to disregard the primary cited prior_art as nonanalogous was also erroneous
under the correct level of ordinary_skill it would have been obvious from chaumat and brochet in view of wimmer and other references to stabilize catalytically hydrogenated leuco_indigo_solution through vacuum conditions and to introduce the solution directly into the dyebath

because all claims are held invalid for obviousness we need not address alleged anticipation of claim 1 or lack of enablement as to claims 1-4
likewise whether the ¡¬992_patent is unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct need not be decided
finally we do not address the request for a new_trial as all asserted claims are held invalid as a matter of law for obviousness
accordingly the trial courts denial of jmol that claims 1-4 of the ¡¬992_patent are invalid for obviousness is reversed
