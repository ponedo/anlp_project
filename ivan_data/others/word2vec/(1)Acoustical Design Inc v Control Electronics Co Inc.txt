no._86-1692 holding appellants liable for infringement of appellees patents and breach of contract and enjoining them from further_infringement of the patents
we affirm

background
on may_17,_1977 u.s._patent 4,024,535 was granted to harold_goldstein on a sound generator for a sound masking system
goldstein assigned the patent to acoustical_design inc. adi
u.s._patent 4,185,167 was granted on january 22 1980 to donald r. cunningham and james e. sulewsky for a sound masking package
adi also became the assignee of that patent
the inventions are for the purpose of masking disturbing background noise and permitting alternation between predetermined sound spectra

adi and control had earlier agreed in 1976 that control would be the exclusive manufacturer of the` noise-mask' product_line products covered by the two patents and that adi would have exclusive rights to market the product_line
control thus became a licensee of adi
in 1982 adi and control further contracted that adi would serve as controls non-exclusive sales representative for sound masking devices ceiling acoustical panels acoustical banners baffles and related products
adi and control maintained this business relationship until late 1985 when as a result of controls failure to pay adi commissions allegedly due to adi under the 1982 agreement the 1976_and_1982 agreements were terminated by adi
control continued to manufacture and sell the same sound masking devices it was previously licensed to manufacture notwithstanding the termination of the agreements

accordingly on may_20,_1986 adi filed suit for patent_infringement and breach of contract in the united_states_district_court for the eastern_district of new_york against appellants
the latter denied infringement and claimed that adis patents were invalid for lack of novelty obviousness and incorrect inventorship
adi *941 moved for summary judgment as to the535_patent based on the doctrine of assignor_estoppel on the theory that goldstein who was a defendant principal of the corporate defendants and in privity with leonard was the inventor named in the patent and therefore could not challenge the patents validity
the district_court denied the motion on the ground that a triable issue of fact existed

in january 1990 the lawsuit was tried for seven days before a jury
appellants attempted to invalidate the patents on the basis of lack of novelty in view of two items of alleged prior_art u.s._patent 4,059,726 issued to watters and public use of an electrical circuit developed and manufactured by radio speakers of canada inc. the rsc_circuit
at the close of all the evidence appellants did not move for a directed verdict nor did they object to any instruction to the jury related to an issue now on appeal

the court submitted to the jury a special verdict form which contained questions relating to the issues in the case
the jury provided answers in appellees favor to each of these interrogatories
appellants did not move for judgment notwithstanding the verdict jnov or for a new_trial
on march 10th the court granted appellees renewed motion for an order finding that the doctrine of assignor_estoppel should have precluded appellants from attacking at trial the validity of the535_patent
the court subsequently entered final judgment for appellee and this appeal followed

discussion
the issue before us is whether this court should vacate and remand for new_trial a judgment rendered on a jury_verdict when no motions for directed verdict jnov or new_trial were made in the district_court and appellant has not demonstrated prejudicial_legal_error to have occurred in the conduct of the trial
we answer this question in the negative

rule 50 b of the federal rules of civil procedure permits a motion for jnov only when a party has previously moved for a directed verdict
no such motion was made here
when no motions for jnov or new_trial are made in the district_court after a jury_verdict prejudicial_legal_error must be shown to have occurred in the conduct of the trial in order for this court to vacate the judgment of the district_court and remand for a new_trial

we find no such error

appellants argue that the court erred` in not allowing a post-verdict special interrogatory to the jury that if claim_construction would result in invalidity of the claim the appropriate conclusion is non-infringement'
appellants said they sought this interrogatory to learn whether the jury construed the claims of the patent to avoid the rsc_circuit
we find no error in the courts decision

the form of special verdict that was issued to the jury dealt very clearly with validity and infringement
the court instructed the jury on the law of patent validity and claim_construction
appellants did not object to any of those instructions then and they can not challenge them here
see fed.r.civ.p
51
the jury concluded that the claims in suit are not invalid ; thus appellants did not meet their burden of proving that the rsc_circuit was invalidating prior_art

appellants also argue that the court erred in holding that a dependent claim must be infringed when an independent claim is infringed
the record nowhere demonstrates that the court made this holding
we therefore view this argument to be without merit

appellants next argue that the trial_court found by implication that the patent claims did not read on the prior_art and that this finding is clearly erroneous
the court did not find this fact by implication ; the jury answered special interrogatories stating that the claims of both patents were not invalid on the basis of lack of novelty
thus no implied finding of fact as argued by appellants was made by the court

*942 appellants further argue that the court erred by preventing appellants patent expert from testifying as to how claims are to be drafted to avoid prior_art and that the claims in suit read on the prior_art
they assert that without this testimony appellants could not effectively demonstrate how applicable law would require findings of non-infringement and inequitable conduct by appellee

admission of expert testimony is within the discretion of the trial_court

a decision on such a question will not be disturbed unless a court abuses its discretion
seattle box co. v. industrial crating & packing inc. 731_f.2d_818 826 221_uspq_568 573 fed.cir.1984
we conclude that appellants have not shown an abuse by the district_court and thus we will not vacate the decision on this ground
we are unpersuaded that the court erred in holding that testimony concerning the drafting of claims to avoid prior_art would not have been of any benefit to the jury

appellants argue that the court erred in awarding damages for unjust_enrichment based on a contractual transfer of know-how and a trademark to which appellee had no rights
adis claim for unjust_enrichment was based upon new_york_law and on appeal the scope of review is limited universal city studios inc. v. nintendo co. ltd. 797_f.2d_70 79 230_uspq_409 416 2d cir

`` the granting of equitable relief lies within the sound discretion of the trial_court so long as that discretion is exercised in accordance with the applicable established precedents'
indyk v. habib bank ltd. 694_f.2d_54 57 2d cir.1982
appellants have not shown that the court erred in concluding that the jury had substantial evidence from which it could find that appellants were unjustly enriched under new_york_law
we thus will not disturb that conclusion

appellants also argue that the court erred in awarding treble_damages and attorney_fees ; they assert that they had a good_faith_belief that adis patents were invalid based on the fact that the patent examiner initially rejected adis patent applications on reexamination
however the jury found by clear and convincing evidence that appellants infringement was willful
awards of increased damages and attorney_fees are within the discretion of the trial_court and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion
rosemount inc. v. beckman instruments inc. 727_f.2d_1540 1547-48 221_uspq_1 8 fed.cir.1984

the district_court in its march_10,_1990 oral decision concurred with the jurys finding of willfulness clearly rejected appellants argument of good_faith_belief in the invalidity of the patents and concluded that appellants either committed perjury or misled the court
accordingly the court trebled appellees damage award and also awarded attorney_fees
the district_court carefully considered the conduct of appellants both before and during the litigation
appellants concede that they only sought the opinion of general not patent counsel with regard to validity and infringement of the patents ; they have not demonstrated that this procedure led to a good_faith_belief that the patents were either invalid or not infringed
we find no abuse of discretion by the court
finally it is clear that initial rejection by the patent and trademark office of original claims that later were confirmed on reexamination hardly justifies a good_faith_belief in the invalidity of the claims

appellant goldstein was the assignor of the535_patent and under diamond scientific co. v. ambico inc. 848_f.2d_1220 1226 6_uspq2d_2028 2031 fed.cir
) cert
dismissed 487_u.s._1265 109_s.ct._28 101_l.ed.2d_978_(1988) the court found that appellant and his privies were precluded from contesting the validity or enforceability of the patent
appellants argue that the district_court erred in concluding that testimony concerning the assignment of the535_patent should have been precluded because they are also licensees under the patent
they assert that under *943 lear inc. v. adkins 395_u.s._653 670 89_s.ct._1902 1911 23_l.ed.2d_610_(1969) a licensee can contest validity and enforceability

this argument is not persuasive
that a patent assignor takes back a license does not free him from the fact that he previously sold the patent for value
as the district_court concluded the assignor in challenging the patent is still asserting that what he sold is worthless and the existence of a license back does not alter that fact
this court in diamond scientific distinguished lear by explaining that the public policy favoring allowing a licensee to contest the validity of the patent is not present in the assignment situation
unlike the licensee who without lear might be forced to continue to pay for a potentially invalid patent the assignor who would challenge the patent has already been fully paid for the patent rights
848 f.2d at 1224 6 uspq2d at 2030
we consider an assignor-licensee to be in a different situation from that of an ordinary licensee and view diamond scientific to be applicable even when there is a subsequent license back to the assignor
thus the district_court did not err in concluding that such testimony should have been precluded

we have considered all of appellants laundry list of arguments and find them all unpersuasive

conclusion
since we conclude that appellants have not demonstrated that prejudicial_legal_error occurred in the conduct of the trial after having failed to move for jnov or seek a new_trial we affirm the judgment appealed from

affirmed
