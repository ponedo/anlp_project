background patentees holding three patents related to extended-rod safety_utility_lighters with automatic locking features brought infringement action against competitors
competitors counterclaimed for invalidity
the united_states_district_court for the central_district of california virginia a. phillips j. 2009_wl_1582924 construed patent claims and thereafter 2009_wl_2047845 granted motion to strike supplemental_invalidity_contentions and granted summary_judgment of invalidity for obviousness

holdings the court of appeals lourie circuit_judge held that

district_court did not abuse its discretion by declining to exempt patentees expert from discovery_rules written report_requirement ;

patentees failure to adhere to discovery_rules written report_requirement for experts was not harmless or substantially justified warranting exclusion of experts declarations ;

competitors did not have enhanced_burden of overcoming statutory_presumption that patents were valid in seeking summary_judgment of invalidity ; and

asserted patent claims were obvious rendering them invalid

july 8 2009
because the district_court correctly granted summary_judgment of invalidity we affirm
as a result we need not decide eastons cross-appeal

background
tokai owns the asserted_patents which relate to safety_utility_lighters having extended lighting_rods useful for lighting barbecue grills for example
the asserted_patents share a priority_date of august 15 1995.1 the claims of the asserted_patents are directed to utility_lighters with automatic child-safety_mechanisms for preventing accidental ignition
tokai competes with easton in the market for safety_utility_lighters
tokai asserts that it has sold more than 100 million safety_utility_lighters in the united_states under one or more of its asserted_patents
sj_order slip op.at 37
tokai also contends that easton has sold more than nine million such lighters

in july 2007 tokai sued easton in the district_court for the central_district of california for infringing the asserted_patents
easton counterclaimed for invalidity
at issue are claim 1 of the ¡¬775_patent ; claims 1 10 and 13 of the ¡¬308_patent ; and claims 1 3 and 4 of the ¡¬017_patent

the parties agree that the asserted claims substantially overlap
each of the asserted independent claims describes a` lighting_rod' i.e. a utility lighter having a particular` safety_device'
the differences among the asserted claims arise primarily in the safety-device portion of the claim
claim 1 of the ¡¬775_patent exemplifies the asserted claims *1362 1
a safety_device in a lighting_rod which lighting_rod is provided with a rod-like_top_end_portion and a main_body the rod-like_top_end_portion being provided with a jetting_nozzle for jetting out a gas the main_body being provided with i a gas_tank ii a valve_mechanism for opening and closing a path through which the gas is supplied from the gas_tank to the jetting_nozzle iii a piezoelectric_unit for generating a discharge_voltage for lighting the gas and
iv an operation_member which is capable of sliding which has an operating_section and which drives the valve_mechanism and the piezoelectric_unit in order to carry out a lighting_operation the operating_section of the operating member being exposed to the exterior of the main_body the safety_device_comprising a a locking member having an engagement_section which interferes with a portion of the operation_member and thereby locks the lighting_operation of the operation_member said locking member being capable of moving in a direction that intersects with the direction along which the operation_member moves and
b an urging member which urges said locking member to a locking direction said locking member being movable to a lock_releasing_position against the urging force of said urging member wherein with the locking member in the lock_releasing_position the lighting_operation is carried out by operating the operating_section of the operation_member and said locking member automatically returns to the state of the locking as the operation_member returns to its original position
¡¬775_patent col.24 l.59-col.25 l.28 emphases added
as illustrated by the relevant portions of figures 8a and 8b of the ¡¬775_patent the claimed utility lighter has a trigger` operation_member' 120 and a safety_device which comprises a` locking member' 125 and a spring` urging member' 26
to operate the lighter the user depresses the locking member against the force of the spring and pulls the trigger
when the user releases the locking member the spring automatically returns the locking member to its initial position where the trigger is blocked from inadvertent actuation

*1363. ?
in june 2009 the district_court issued a claim_construction_order after which easton stipulated that its accused utility_lighters infringe all but one of the asserted claims as construed by the court.2 sj_order slip op.at 3

in september 2009 tokai moved for summary_judgment on eastons counterclaim of invalidity for obviousness and easton filed a cross-motion for summary_judgment for obviousness of the asserted_patents over four prior_art_references
in opposition to eastons motion tokai submitted expert_declarations from dr. jones the` jones declaration' and mr
sung the` sung_declaration'
easton objected to the declarations and the district_court sustained eastons objection
sj_order slip op.at 6-7
the district_court noted that tokai failed to submit written reports from jones and sung during expert_discovery and that as a result easton was denied an opportunity to depose these witnesses on the subject_matter of their expert_declarations
the court thus declined to consider either declaration in resolving the parties summary_judgment motions

on the issue of invalidity the district_court determined that there existed no genuine_issue of material_fact as to the obviousness of the asserted claims over the four prior_art_references asserted by easton u.s
patents 5,326,256` shike' ; 5,199,865` liang' ; 5,090,893` floriot' ; and 4,832,596` morris'
in doing so the court applied the four-factor analysis for obviousness under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 as set forth in graham v. john_deere_co. 383_u.s._1 17-18 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966)
first the court found no genuine_issue of material_fact regarding the scope and content of the asserted prior_art_references
sj_order slip op.at 18-22
secondly the court found no material_dispute *1364 regarding the differences between the prior_art and the claimed invention
id.at 23-33
the court found that with the exception of a single aspect of claims 10_and_13 of the ¡¬308_patent discussed further infra each element of the asserted claims was disclosed in the asserted_prior_art
id.at 23
third with regard to the level of skill in the art the district_court noted that the parties disagreed sharply
the court determined however that the dispute was immaterial as the courts conclusion on obviousness was the same under either partys asserted level of skill
id.at 36
finally the court evaluated tokais alleged_objective_indicia of nonobviousness
tokai asserted that its commercial_success supported patentability but the court found no nexus between the sales_data and the merits of the invention beyond what was available in the prior_art
id.at 38-39
the court also found unpersuasive tokais asserted_evidence that easton copied the claimed inventions
id.at 40
based on its analysis of the graham_factors the district_court concluded that the asserted claims would have been obvious to one of ordinary_skill in the art as of the priority_date of the asserted_patents and entered final judgment on october 23 2009

tokai timely appealed from the district_courts exclusion of its expert_declarations and from the district_courts grant of summary_judgment of invalidity of the asserted claims
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

discussion
a
the district_court did not abuse its discretion by excluding the expert evidence
we review a district_courts decision to exclude evidence under the law of the regional circuit
del
valley floral grp. inc. v. shaw rose nets llc 597_f.3d_1374 1379 fed.cir.2010
the ninth_circuit the pertinent regional circuit in this case reviews a district_courts decision to exclude evidence on summary_judgment for abuse of discretion
wong v. regents of univ
of cal. 410_f.3d_1052 1060 9th_cir.2005

tokai argues that the district_court abused its discretion by excluding the jones and sung_declarations
with regard to the sung_declaration tokai argues that the court failed to find that sung was exempt from the written report_requirement of federal_rule of civil procedure 26 a 2 b
specifically tokai asserts on appeal that rule 26 a 2 b permits sung as an employee of tokai to offer an expert declaration without an accompanying written report
tokai further argues that its failure to submit written expert_reports for both jones and sung should be excused under rule 37 c 1 because tokai was justified in not providing written reports to rebut eastons expert_testimony

in response easton argues that the district_court did not abuse its discretion by excluding the jones and sung_declarations for failure to comply with the written report_requirement of rule 26 a 2 b
with respect to the sung_declaration easton argues that its exclusion was not an abuse of discretion because there is no evidence in the record that sung was an employee of tokai
easton also argues that the district_court properly excluded the declarations under rule 37 c 1 because tokai was not justified in failing to submit the written reports and because easton was prejudiced by its inability to depose jones and sung on the subject_matter of their declarations
finally easton argues that the two declarations are wholly conclusory and therefore their exclusion even if an abuse of discretion was harmless

under rule 26 a 2 b the disclosure of expert_testimony must be accompanied *1365 by a written report prepared and signed by the expert witness` if the witness is one retained or specially employed to provide expert_testimony in the case or one whose duties as the partys employee regularly involve giving expert_testimony'
thus rule 26 a 2 b contemplates an employee-expert_exception to the written report_requirement for` individuals who are employed by a party and whose duties do not regularly involve giving expert_testimony'
torres v. city of los_angeles 548_f.3d_1197 1214 9th cir.2008

rule 37 c 1` gives teeth' to the written report_requirement of rule 26 a 2 b by forbidding a partys use of improperly disclosed information at a trial at a hearing or on a motion unless the partys failure to disclose is substantially justified or harmless
yeti by molly ltd. v. deckers outdoor corp. 259_f.3d_1101 1106 9th cir.2001
in reviewing the district_courts decision to exclude the declarations we are mindful to give` particularly wide latitude to the district_courts discretion to issue sanctions under rule 37 c 1'
id
(` courts have upheld the use of the sanction even when a litigants entire cause of action or defense has been precluded
``

with respect to rule 26 a 2 b tokai failed to introduce evidence indicating that sung qualified for the employee-expert_exception
tokai alleges that during the summary_judgment hearing it informed the district_court of sungs status as a tokai_employee
the record indicates otherwise
tokais counsel stated only that sung` has personal knowledge of the [ ] patents-in-suit because he has dealt with them' and that he` was not obligated to provide an expert_report because he was one of ordinary_skill in the art'
j.a
2255-56
these statements fail to assert let alone prove that sung was a tokai_employee entitled to exemption from the written report_requirement of rule 26 a 2 b
moreover even if sung were a tokai_employee tokai failed to introduce evidence indicating that his duties did not` regularly involve giving expert_testimony'
rule 26 a 2 b
thus the district_court did not abuse its discretion by declining to exempt sung from the written report_requirement of rule 26 a 2 b

regarding rule 37 c 1 we agree with the district_court that tokais failure to adhere to the requirements of rule 26 a 2 b was neither harmless nor substantially justified
tokai does not argue that it lacked the time or ability to prepare and submit the required written reports
before the close of expert_discovery tokai acknowledged that it was` fully prepared.. to confront the challenges to its patents presented by eastons preliminary invalidity contentions' which included all four asserted prior_art_references

june_29,_2009 doc
no._64
yet tokai made a tactical decision not to submit written reports from its experts
j.a
2255-56
tokai contends that there was no reason to submit the written reports because the invalidity portions of eastons expert_report were` effectively gutted' by the courts exclusion of particular prior_art_references on which eastons expert relied
appellants opening_br.at 22
this assertion has no merit however as easton relied on its expert_report at summary_judgment only to establish the appropriate_level of skill in the art
sj_order slip op.at 6-7

the written report_requirement of rule 26 a 2 a provided reason enough for tokai to submit the written reports given that tokai proffers no justification apart from its own subjective beliefs
we have *1366 previously cautioned litigants of the` pitfalls of playing fast and loose with rules of discovery' conclusory expert_reports eleventh hour disclosures and attempts to proffer expert_testimony without compliance with rule 26 violate both the rules and principles of discovery and the obligations lawyers have to the court
exclusion and forfeiture are appropriate consequences to avoid repeated occurrences of such manipulation of the litigation process
innogenetics n.v. v. abbott labs. 512_f.3d_1363 1376_n._4_(fed.cir.2008)
in addition tokais failure to submit the required written reports prejudiced easton by preventing easton from deposing jones and sung on the subject_matter of their expert_testimony
we thus hold that the district_court did not abuse its discretion by excluding the jones and sung_declarations

furthermore even assuming the district_court abused its discretion by excluding the sung_declaration the error was harmless as the declaration is conclusory and does not raise a genuine_issue of material_fact
see e.g. lockwood v. am
airlines inc. 107_f.3d_1565 1571 fed.cir.1997 affirming summary_judgment of obviousness because statements of patentees expert were conclusory and thus failed to raise a genuine_issue of material_fact

b
the district_court did not err by invalidating the asserted claims
we review de novo a district_courts grant of summary_judgment drawing all reasonable_inferences in favor of the nonmovant

a claimed invention is unpatentable if the differences between it and the prior_art are such that the subject_matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary_skill in the pertinent art

moreover` a district_court can properly grant as a matter of law a motion for summary_judgment on patent invalidity when the factual_inquiries into obviousness present no genuine_issue of material_facts'

whether an invention would have been obvious at the time it was made is a question of law which we review de novo based on underlying facts which we review for clear error

denied -- - u.s. -- -- 131_s.ct._305 178_l.ed.2d_144_(2010)
when the facts underlying an obviousness_determination are not in dispute we review whether summary_judgment of invalidity is correct by applying the law to the undisputed_facts
id
; karsten mfg co. v. cleveland golf co. 242_f.3d_1376 1384-85 fed.cir.2001

tokai first argues that the court failed to impose on easton an enhanced_burden to rebut the presumption of validity of the asserted claims because some of the asserted prior_art_references were considered during prosecution of the asserted_patents
tokai then asserts that genuine_issues of material_fact remained regarding the scope and content of the asserted prior *1367 art and the differences between the asserted claims and the prior_art
tokai further contends that the district_court erroneously failed to credit tokais asserted_evidence of nonobvious-ness including commercial_success and copying
finally tokai argues that the district_courts legal conclusion of obviousness was flawed because there was no motivation to combine the asserted prior_art_references and in any event combining the prior_art_references to make the claimed inventions would have required substantial modification of the prior_art

in response easton argues that the court correctly determined that there is no requirement on the facts of this case for an enhanced_burden to overcome the presumption of validity
easton contends that there is no genuine factual dispute as to the scope and content of the prior_art and that there are no unpredictable differences between the asserted claims and the prior_art
easton further asserts that the district_court correctly determined that the alleged_objective_indicia did not overcome the showing of obviousness
as a result easton argues the court correctly granted summary_judgment of obviousness on the asserted claims

we agree with the district_court that easton did not have an enhanced_burden of overcoming the statutory_presumption of validity
under 35 u.s.c.¡± 282 each claim of a patent shall be presumed valid ; an accused infringer must prove invalidity by clear and convincing_evidence
metabolite labs. inc. v. lab corp. of am
holdings 370_f.3d_1354 1365 fed.cir.2004
easton is correct in noting that although the standard of proof does not depart from that of clear and convincing_evidence a party challenging validity shoulders an enhanced_burden if the invalidity argument relies on the same prior_art considered during examination by the u.s._patent and trademark office` pto'
for example we have stated that` [ w ] hen no prior_art other than that which was considered by the pto examiner is relied on by the attacker he has the added burden of overcoming the deference that is due to a qualified government agency presumed to have properly done its job
`` poweroasis inc. v. t-mobile usa inc. 522_f.3d_1299 1304 fed.cir.2008 quoting am
hoist & derrick_co. v. sowa & sons 725_f.2d_1350 1359 fed.cir.1984
an added burden of deference to the pto is not required however with respect to invalidity arguments based on evidence that the pto did not consider
am
hoist & derrick_co. 725 f.2d at 1360
here as the district_court found and as tokai itself acknowledges not all of the asserted_prior_art was considered by the pto
sj_order slip op.at 12-13
for example floriot a key reference forming part of eastons challenge to the validity of each of the asserted claims was not considered by the pto during examination of any of the asserted_patents
in addition as noted by the district_court the pto did not consider certain of the other asserted prior_art_references with respect to each of the asserted_patents
id.at 10-11
accordingly we agree with the district_court that an added burden is not required here

we turn next to the factual_inquiries that form the background of any obviousness analysis under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103
graham 383 u.s. at 17-18 86_s.ct._684
with regard to the first graham factor the scope and content of the prior_art the district_court correctly found no genuine_issue of material_fact
the parties do not dispute that utility_lighters without a safety_device as exemplified by shike were available as of the priority_date
sj_order slip op.at 19
regarding liang the parties agree that this reference discloses a utility lighter with a safety_device in which the safety_device must be manually *1368 reset to the locking_position after each use
id.at 19-20
the parties also agree that floriot discloses a cigarette lighter with a safety_device that automatically resets after each use
further as the district_court found the parties do not materially dispute that the safety_device in floriot comprises a blocking member that prevents ignition while in the locked_position a return spring that applies constant pressure on the blocking member to return it to its locked_position and a safety_mechanism that resets only after the user ignites the lighter
id.at 21-22
finally with respect to morris the court correctly perceived no genuine dispute that morris teaches a cigarette lighter with a safety_device mounted on the side of the lighter ; that the lighter is operated via sequential_action of the users finger and thumb first to disengage the safety_device then to ignite the lighter ; and that the safety_device automatically resets to the locking_position after each use
id.at 22

with regard to the second_graham_factor the differences between the asserted claims and the prior_art we again discern no error in the district_courts analysis of the parties contentions
regarding each of the asserted claims the court found no dispute that utility_lighters including utility_lighters with safety_devices were known in the prior_art as shike and liang demonstrate
id.at 23
with respect to claim 1 of the ¡¬775_patent the court correctly found no material_dispute that floriot teaches each of the four essential components of the claimed safety_device a locking member that locks the lighter by hindering the movement of the operation_member ; an urging member that pushes the locking member into the locking_position ; the ability to operate the lighter by pushing the locking member against the urging force ; and the automatic_return of the locking member to the locking_position after use
id.at 24-27

regarding claim 1 of the ¡¬308_patent we agree with the district_court that this claim is` substantially identical to claim 1 of the ¡¬775_patent' but for the additional limitation of an` unlocking member' which moves the locking member against the urging force of the urging member and is located opposite the operation_member
id.at 27
moreover the district_court found that easton demonstrated and tokai did not refute that morris teaches a lighter with such an unlocking member
id.at 28
the district_court did not err by finding no material_factual_dispute that shike floriot and morris together disclose each element of claim 1 of the ¡¬308_patent

claim 10 of the ¡¬308_patent discloses a utility lighter comprising a safety_device with a` locking element' and an` unlocking_element'
this claim is broader than claim 1 of the ¡¬775_patent and claim 1 of the ¡¬308_patent in that it requires neither an urging member nor an automatic_return of the locking element to the locking_position
the court found no dispute that floriot discloses a locking element and that morris discloses an unlocking_element as recited in claim 10 of the ¡¬308_patent
id.at 30
as the district_court correctly found the only_difference between claim 10 and the asserted_prior_art is the intended position of the hand while operating the lighter in claim 10 the thumb engages the unlocking_element and a finger engages the operation_member ; in morris the intended positions of the finger and thumb are reversed
id
claim 13 which depends from claim 10 adds an` urging_means' limitation which as the court discussed in connection with claim 1 of the ¡¬775_patent and claim 1 of the ¡¬308_patent floriot discloses
id.at 30-31

claim 1 of the ¡¬017_patent claims a utility lighter with a safety_device_comprising a` locking_means' which is rotatable *1369 between a locking_position and a lock-release_position and an` urging_means' which urges the locking_means toward the locking_position
tokai does not dispute on appeal the district_courts holding that` locking_means' corresponds to` [ t ] he combination of the locking member and the portion of the lighter case on which the locking member is mounted'
tokai_corp. 2009_wl_1582924 at *7
we agree with the district_court that floriot discloses a rotatable locking_means as claimed and that floriot further discloses an urging_means as the court discussed in connection with the ¡¬775 and ¡¬308_patent s. sj_order slip op.at 31-32

claims 3_and_4 of the ¡¬017_patent are dependent upon claim 1
claim 3 adds the requirement that the lighting_operation can be repeated so long as the locking member is held in the lock-releasing position
the district_court correctly found no dispute that floriot is capable of such repeated lighting
id.at 32
claim 4 adds the limitation that the locking_means has a` locking section' which prevents the lighting_operation by engaging with the operation_member while in the locking_position and which permits the lighting_operation while in the lock-release_position by disengaging from the operation_member
the district_court found and we agree that floriot discloses a blocking member that meets this` locking section' limitation
id.at 33

in sum viewing all facts and reasonable_inferences in the light most favorable to tokai we do not discern any error in the district_courts analysis of the second_graham_factor the differences between the prior_art and the asserted claims
the district_court correctly found no dispute that the asserted_prior_art discloses each element of claim 1 of the ¡¬775_patent claim 1 of the ¡¬308_patent and claims 1 3 and 4 of the ¡¬017_patent
the court also correctly found that the only_difference between the asserted_prior_art and claims 10_and_13 of the ¡¬308_patent is the intended position of the thumb and finger for operating the lighter

although at the district_court the parties disputed the third graham factor the appropriate_level of skill in the art neither party on appeal contends that the court erred by assuming without deciding that the level of skill in the art was` an individual showing aptitude in high_school_shop_class or someone who builds takes apart or repairs basic mechanical toys/devices'
sj_order slip op.at 34
we too discern no error in the district_courts assumption
the standard adopted by the district_court was the less sophisticated of the two asserted standards
id.at 36
since the district_court found that the asserted claims would have been obvious to a less sophisticated artisan then under the facts of this case the court could not have arrived at a different conclusion by adopting the viewpoint of one with greater skill and experience
accordingly the parties disagreement at the district_court as to the appropriate_level of skill in the art did not create a genuine_issue of material_fact precluding summary_judgment

with regard to the final_graham_factor secondary indicia of nonobviousness the district_court considered tokais evidence of commercial_success and copying
id.at 37-40
regarding commercial_success this factor` may have relevancy' to the overall obviousness_determination graham 383 u.s. at 18 86_s.ct._684 but a nexus must exist between the commercial_success and the claimed invention

in discussing the marketing and sales of tokais utility_lighters tokais corporate representative not once referred to the automatic locking feature of tokais lighters-i.e. the feature that purportedly distinguishes the claimed inventions from prior_art_utility_lighters
the district_court thus held that because tokai failed to establish a nexus between the automatic safety feature and the alleged commercial_success tokais sales_data were not pertinent to the courts obviousness_determination

we agree with the district_court with respect to the final_graham_factor
tokai proffered no evidence from which one could reasonably infer a nexus between its sales_data and its utility_lighters automatic-locking features
sj_order slip op.at 38-39 ; see also cable elec prods. inc. v. genmark inc. 770_f.2d_1015 1027 fed.cir.1985 holding on summary_judgment that even though commercial_success could be deduced it deserved no weight because a nexus was not established overruled on other grounds by midwest indus. inc. v. karavan trailers inc. 175_f.3d_1356_(fed.cir.1999) en banc
however even assuming the existence of a nexus we see no error in the district_courts determination that tokai failed to establish` that any of these secondary factors are significant' sj_order slip op.at 37 in light of the strong_showing of prima_facie obviousness as discussed infra

we further agree with the district_court that tokais asserted_evidence of copying viz. eastons stipulation of infringement is unpersuasive
see ecolochem inc. v. s. cal
edison co. 227_f.3d_1361 1380 fed.cir.2000 noting that` a showing of copying is only equivocal evidence of non-obviousness in the absence of more compelling objective indicia of other secondary_considerations'
copying` requires evidence of efforts to replicate a specific_product'
wyers v. master lock co. 616_f.3d_1231 1246 fed.cir.2010
a stipulation of infringement taken alone is not probative of copying
see e.g. iron grip barbell_co. inc. v. usa sports inc. 392_f.3d_1317 1325 fed.cir.2004

from the foundation established by the aforementioned factual_inquiries we must determine whether the district_court legally erred by invalidating the asserted claims for obviousness
in ksr the supreme_court stated that in situations where` the content of the prior_art the scope of the patent claim and the level of ordinary_skill in the art are not in material_dispute and the obviousness of the claim is apparent in light of these factors summary_judgment is appropriate'
ksr_int l_co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 427 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007)
such is the case here

*1371 the district_court correctly found no material_factual_dispute as to each of the graham_factors
by tokais own admission the components required to assemble the claimed inventions are` simple mechanical parts that are well known in the art'
appellants opening_br.at 54
while that in itself does not render the claims obvious ksr_int l_co. 550 u.s. at 418 127_s.ct._1727 it is also undisputed that a need for safer_utility_lighters was recognized in the art as of the priority_date
e.g. ¡¬775_patent col.1 ll.20-25 noting that` a need exists for a lighting_rod having enhanced safety characteristics' and that` [ t ] o satisfy such a need lighting_rods provided with various safety_devices have been proposed' in the prior_art ; appellants combined reply & response br.at 16` the district_court correctly noted that the [ asserted_patents ] identify a need for child-resistant utility_lighters.. to be sure the problem in the art was how to make lighters more safe..'
furthermore the parties agree that cigarette_lighters and utility_lighters are analogous_arts
one of ordinary_skill would thus be directed to the claimed safety_utility_lighters by combining available utility_lighters with prior_art automatic locking mechanisms on cigarette_lighters
we have consistently stated that courts` may find a motivation to combine prior_art_references in the nature of the problem to be solved' and that` [ t ] his form of motivation to combine evidence is particularly relevant with simpler mechanical technologies'
ruiz v. a.b
chance co. 357_f.3d_1270 1276 fed.cir.2004 ; see also rothman v. target corp. 556_f.3d_1310 1319 fed.cir.2009 ; pro-mold & tool_co. v. great_lakes_plastics inc. 75_f.3d_1568 1573 fed.cir.1996

accordingly the undisputed_facts in this case-including the state of the prior_art the simplicity and availability of the components making up the claimed invention and an explicit need in the prior_art for safer_utility_lighters-compel a conclusion of obviousness as to the subject_matter of each of the asserted claims
ksr_int l_co. 550 u.s. at 419-20 127_s.ct._1727` one of the ways in which a patents subject_matter can be proved obvious is by noting that there existed at the time of invention a known problem for which there was an obvious solution encompassed by the patents claims`
a strong case of prima_facie obviousness such as that presented here can not be overcome by a far weaker showing of objective indicia of nonobviousness
see media_tech
licensing 596 f.3d at 1339 ; ryko_mfg co. 950 f.2d at 719

although a need in the prior_art for safer_utility_lighters is not disputed tokai contends that the solutions to this problem were` not at all predictable' and required` radical modification' of the asserted_prior_art
we reject these arguments
one of ordinary_skill in the art would not have viewed the subject_matter of the asserted claims as unpredictable
as the supreme_court recognized in ksr the nature of the mechanical arts is such that` identified predictable solutions' to known problems may be within the technical grasp of a skilled_artisan
550 u.s. at 421 127_s.ct._1727 ; see also rothman 556 f.3d at 1319 stating that in the predictable arts a claimed invention may be invalidated more readily by showing` a motivation to combine known elements to yield a predictable result'
moreover it is undisputed that cigarette_lighters and utility_lighters are analogous_arts and that a need for enhanced safety_devices had been met in the field of cigarette_lighters as demonstrated by floriot and morris
it would have been obvious to one of ordinary_skill and creativity to adapt the safety_mechanisms of the prior_art cigarette_lighters as disclosed in floriot and/or morris to fit a utility lighter as disclosed by shike even if it required some variation in the selection *1372 or arrangement of particular components
ksr_int l_co. 550 u.s. at 417 127_s.ct._1727` when a work is available in one field of endeavor design incentives and other market forces can prompt variations of it either in the same field or a different one
``

in light of the foregoing we hold that the asserted claims are invalid as obvious
specifically with regard to claim 1 of the ¡¬775_patent the court did not err by holding on summary_judgment that the claimed subject_matter as a whole would have been obvious over shike and floriot
each of the components making up the claimed subject_matter existed in the prior_art including the utility lighter the locking member the urging member the ability to move the locking member in a direction opposite the urging force and the automatic_return of the locking member to the locking_position following ignition
there was a recognized need in the prior_art for safer_utility_lighters that would have provided one of ordinary_skill with a definite reason for modifying the prior_art_utility_lighters exemplified by shike and liang
one of ordinary_skill would thus have been motivated to adapt these utility_lighters to incorporate the automatic safety_devices available in the art as exemplified by floriot and morris

similarly the court did not err by holding that the subject_matter of claims 1 10 and 13 of the ¡¬308_patent would have been obvious over shike floriot and morris
the ¡¬308_patent addresses the same problem as the ¡¬ 775 patent
¡¬308_patent col.1 ll.23-29
in addition to the elements of claim 1 of the ¡¬775_patent an unlocking member is required by claim 1 of the ¡¬308_patent
morris indisputably discloses this element and morris like shike and floriot is analogous art available to the skilled_artisan
it therefore would have been obvious for one of ordinary_skill to combine the required elements from the asserted_prior_art to arrive at the subject_matter of claim 1 of the ¡¬308_patent
the required elements of claim 10 of the ¡¬ 308 patent include a utility lighter an example of which is disclosed by shike ; a locking element an example of which is disclosed by floriot ; and an unlocking_element an example of which is disclosed by morris
the only missing claim limitation-the intended position of the finger and thumb when using the lighter-is nothing more than a predictable variation on the prior_art
ksr_int l_co. 550 u.s. at 417 127_s.ct._1727
in both the claimed invention and in morris the lighter is operated via sequential_action of the finger and thumb ; a mere reversal in the order of these actions does not confer patentability
claim 13 of the ¡¬308_patent which is dependent upon claim 10 adds the requirement of an urging_means as floriot discloses
we discern no error in the district_courts conclusion that claims 1 10 and 13 of the ¡¬308_patent are invalid as obvious

finally regarding the ¡¬017_patent the district_court did not err by holding the subject_matter of claims 1 3 and 4 obvious over shike and floriot
as with the ¡¬775_patent each of the elements was found in analogous prior_art including for claim 1 a utility lighter a locking_means and an urging_means ; for claim 3 the added limitation of repeatability of the lighting_operation ; and for claim 4 the added limitation of a locking section that operates in the specified manner
one of ordinary_skill would have had the motivation and capability of adapting and assembling these prior_art components into the subject_matter of the asserted claims

conclusion
for the foregoing reasons the district_court did not abuse its discretion by excluding the expert_reports and did not legally err by determining that the asserted claims are invalid

newman circuit_judge dissenting
the invention patented by tokai corporation is a utility_rod lighter of the sort used to light barbeques or fireplaces having a novel safety_mechanism that achieves a new level of child-safety over the prior_art
the tokai_lighter displaced previously available child-safety rod utility_lighters and received the ultimate accolade of copying by the competition

the tokai_lighter has an ingenious safety design whereby the device is simple to operate by adults but not by children unlike prior_art_utility_lighters and locks automatically after use unlike prior_art_utility_lighters
the tokai safety structure does not result from direct combination of the prior_art
nonetheless the district_court and now this court hold on summary_judgment that the asserted claims of the tokai patents are invalid for obviousness
i must respectfully dissent

i
the basic structure of a utility_rod lighter is illustrated in a patent to shike cited by the district_court as prior_art to tokais claimed lighter

?
u.s._patent 5,326,256` shike'
shike shows the typical extended rod for lighting the charcoal or other fuel and a trigger 18 operated mechanism that causes a piezoelectric_unit 20 to discharge_voltage that ignites combustible gas released from a gas reservoir 7
shike patent col 3
ii
5-15
although shike does not have a safety_mechanism utility_rod lighters are currently required to have safety_features to prevent accidental or uncontrolled ignition particularly by children

the typical safety_features in utility_lighters operate in three steps first the user releases a locking mechanism ; then the lighter is used generally by a trigger-initiated ignition mechanism ; then the lighter is relocked
for example the cited prior_art patent to liang shows a utility lighter with a safety_mechanism that is manually controlled

*1374. ?
u.s._patent 5,199,865` liang'
as the district_court explained liang teaches a utility_rod lighter with a control knob safety_mechanism 3 that` must be manually set to a locking_position or operational position and will not automatically return to a locking_position after use'
tokai_corp. v. easton_enters inc. no._507-cv-00883 c.d.cal
oct._27,_2009` sj_order` slip op.at 20

in contrast tokais device provides two aspects of childproof safety first the device is not operable by a childs hand and second it locks automatically after use
the tokai device requires an adult hand for concurrent two-finger_operation whereby the locking member is unlocked by the adult thumb while the trigger is simultaneously operated by the adult index finger ; these steps must be concurrent not sequential
after release the mechanism automatically returns to the locked_position
the simplicity the ease of operation the child-proof effectiveness and the safety of this design displaced the competition
the record states that tokai has sold more than 100 million of these utility_lighters in the united_states ; tokais vice president testified that large retailers such as wal-mart told him that they were purchasing tokais lighters because of the improved child safety` as it relates to our mechanism versus the competition'

tokai asserted claim 1 of the 5,697,775 the` ¡¬775_patent` ; claims 1 10_and_13 of the 5,897,308 the` ¡¬308_patent` ; and claims 1 3 and 4 of the 6,093,017 the` ¡¬017_patent` all inventions of saito et al
on summary_judgment the district_court held all of the asserted claims invalid for obviousness
i can not agree

the tokai ¡¬308_patent utility lighter safety feature is illustrated in the patent as follows

*1375. ?
u.s._patent 5,897,308` saito'
as shown by the arrow in figure 8a when the users thumb depresses the lock-releasing button 125c of the locking member 125 the engagement_section of the locking member 125b moves from the engagement groove 120f into the operation_member or trigger 120 and the shaft 125a slides along the vertical groove 120e of the operation_member so that it becomes possible for the trigger to be pulled simultaneously with depression of the lock-releasing button
id
col.16 ll.18-31
after the trigger is pulled and ignition is achieved on release of the device the spring 26 automatically returns the locking member to the locked_position whereby the trigger can not be pulled
id
col.16 ll.31-33
claim 10 is directed to the device and its thumb and finger_operation 10
a safety_device in a lighting_rod which lighting_rod is provided with a rod-like_top_end_portion and a main_body the rod-like_top_end_portion being provided with a jetting_nozzle for jetting out a gas the main_body being provided with i a gas_tank ii a valve_mechanism for opening and closing a path through which the gas is supplied from the gas_tank to the jetting_nozzle iii a piezoelectric_unit for generating a discharge_voltage for lighting the gas and
iv an operation_member which is capable of sliding which has an operating_section and which drives the valve_mechanism and the piezoelectric_unit in order to carry out a lighting_operation the operating_section of the operating member being exposed to the exterior of the main_body in a position to be capable of operational engagement by a finger of a hand holding the lighting_rod the safety_device_comprising a a locking element which is disposed inside the main_body to be movable *1376 between a locking_position where it prevents motion of the operation_member in a direction to produce the lighting_operation and a lock_release_position where it allows motion of the operation_member in a direction to permit the lighting_operation and
b an unlocking_element which is exposed to the exterior of the main_body at a location opposite from the operation_member so as to be engagable by the thumb of the hand holding the lighting_rod to move the locking element from the locking_position to the unlocking_position while a finger of that hand engages the operation section
id
col.33 l.44-col.34 l.28 emphases added
claim 13 adds the automatic locking limitation that the unlocking_element is normally urged away from the lock_release_position by` urging_means'
id
col.34 ll.43-47

the district_court held all of the claims invalid for obviousness based on the combination of the shike utility lighter supra which has no safety feature with the safety_features of a cigarette_lighter_patent to morris and/or a cigarette_lighter_patent to floriot
however these features if combined do not produce the saito_device
the morris cigarette lighter is as follows

?
u.s._patent 4,832,596` morris'
the morris safety feature consists of a stop member 9 with an inturned wedge portion 12 which when in the locked_position prevents actuation of the lever 4a which controls the opening of the lighters gas_valve
the user grasps the lighter in such a manner that the index finger presses at 16 thereby sliding the wedge portion 12 outwardly from underneath the lever 4a and releasing the gas_valve whereby the gas is ignited by striking the flint_wheel
id.at col.3 11.5-15
this patent was cited during examination the pto recognizing the differences in mechanism and operation from the saito_device

the floriot lighter also blocks the opening of a gas_valve in a flint and wheel cigarette lighter illustrated as follows

*1377. ?
?
u.s._patent 5,090,893` floriot'
the floriot lighter safety_mechanism has a rocking lever 15 shown at the top of figure 9 that controls the opening of a burner valve and a blocking_lever 24 24a shown at the bottom of figure 6 that blocks the operation of the rocking lever
in operating the floriot lighter first the blocking_lever is moved to an unblocking_position by the thumb in which position the blocking_lever is held by a projection
the thumb then operates the unblocked cigarette lighter using the flint_wheel
these are sequential_actions and do not require two-finger coordination
the blocking_lever returns to the locked_position automatically after operation of the cigarette lighter
id
col.8 ll.13-30

the district_court held that it would have been obvious to a person of ordinary_skill defined for summary_judgment purposes as a person with aptitude for high_school_shop_class to combine the various elements of the prior_art to create the saito_device
however the saito_device is not a simple insertion of the floriot or morris cigarette lighter safety_mechanism into a utility lighter as in the combination *1378 of known structures exemplified in ksr_international_co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007)
where as here the features of one reference can not be substituted into the structure of a second_reference this weighs against obviousness
see orthopedic equip co. v. united_states 702_f.2d_1005 1013 fed.cir.1983` the fact that features of one reference can not be substituted into the structure of a second_reference may indicate that the claims were nonobvious in view of the combined teachings of the two references
``

both morris and shike were cited in the ¡¬775_patent and the specification of the ¡¬308_patent recognizes that` the aforesaid safety_mechanisms for gas lighters can not be directly applied to a lighting_rod which has a different structure'
¡¬308_patent col.1 l.52 col.2 ll.1-3

defendants have not met this burden

the district_court applied an incorrect standard
the determination of obviousness is not whether a person could with full knowledge of the patented_device reproduce it from prior_art or known principles
the question is whether it would have been obvious without knowledge of the patentees achievement to produce the same thing that the patentee produced
this judgment must be made without the benefit of hindsight
it is improper to take concepts from other devices and change them in light of the now-known template of the patented_device without some direction in the prior_art that would render it obvious to do so

in a crowded and competitive field such as this is stated to be a modification that achieves a valuable improvement is of significance in view of the many entrants seeking commercial advantage
see in re hummer 44_ccpa_814 241_f.2d_742 744 1957` applicant seeks a patent on only a narrow improvement
progress is as important however in crowded arts as well as in those which are in the pioneer stage'
as the hummer court recognized incremental but unobvious improvements serve the public interest and are included in the purpose of the patent incentive

the obviousness_determination often presents a close question as recognized by judge learned hand` courts never tire or at least in earlier times they never did of expatiating upon the freshness of insight which observes a little but fruitful change which had theretofore escaped detection by those engaged in the field'

see arkie lures inc. v. gene larew tackle inc. 119_f.3d_953 957 fed.cir.1997` the so-calledsecondary_considerations provide evidence of how the patented_device is viewed by the interested public not the inventor but persons concerned with the product in the objective arena of the marketplace..
such aspects may be highly probative of the issue of nonobviousness'

procedural error appears to have disadvantaged the patentee
the district_court excluded from consideration on the summary_judgment record the declaration of mr. kil young sung for failure to provide a written expert witness report
federal_rule 26 a 2 b provides that expert_testimony must be accompanied by a written report` if the witness is one retained or specially employed to provide expert_testimony in the case or one whose duties as the partys employee regularly involve giving expert_testimony'
however a partys employee who does not meet this rule need not provide a written expert_report
tokai states that mr
sung was indeed an employee exempt from the rule 26 a 2 b report_requirement and that when the issue was raised in connection with the summary_judgment proceeding tokai was improperly barred from showing his employee status
i must agree that this procedure was flawed

my colleagues state that the exclusion was` harmless'

the district_court exceeded its discretion in denying tokai the opportunity to establish the admissibility of this evidence under rule 26 a

conclusion
the district_court referred to the known need for an improved safety_mechanism for utility_lighters and stated that this need was a reason to modify the prior_art to make tokais improved lighter
to the contrary the continuing need weighs against the obviousness of this successful device

nor is it reasonable to trivialize an improvement by its relative simplicity
to the contrary the fact that this improvement eluded discovery and that its advantages were immediately apparent to the marketplace and to the competition weigh in favor of nonobviousness
at a minimum summary_judgment of invalidity was improperly granted
my colleagues err in sustaining that judgment
