scimed_life_systems inc. scimed owns three u.s. patents drawn to features of balloon dilatation catheters u.s. patent nos._5156,594 the ¡¬ 594 patent 5,217,482 the ¡¬482_patent and 5,395,334 the ¡¬334_patent
scimed filed suit against advanced cardiovascular systems inc. acs in the united_states_district_court for the northern_district of california *1339 charging acs with infringement of each of the three patents
on acss motion for summary_judgment the district_court ruled that acs had not infringed the disputed patents
the district_courts ruling was based on the courts conclusion that the asserted claims were limited to a structure not found in acss accused devices and on the courts conclusion that acss devices did not infringe scimeds patents under the doctrine of equivalents
we agree with the district_courts claim_construction and its ruling on the equivalents issue
we therefore affirm the summary_judgment of non-infringement

i
balloon dilatation catheters are used in coronary_angioplasty_procedures to remove restrictions in coronary arteries
the scimed_patents describe catheters having three sections a first_shaft_section a second_shaft_section and a transition_section between the two
the first_shaft_section is long relatively stiff and generally tubular
the second_shaft_section is relatively flexible and contains a balloon at the end which is inflated to relieve the arterial_restriction
the transition_section connects the first and second_shaft_sections and provides a gradual transition in stiffness between the two shaft sections

the catheters claimed in the scimed_patents contain two passageways or lumens
the first lumen the guide-wire_lumen is used to guide the catheter through a patients arteries to the site of the arterial_restriction
a guide_wire is first inserted into one of the patients arteries
the guide-wire_lumen is then threaded over the guide_wire to guide the catheter through the patients arteries until the catheter reaches the coronary restriction
in the invention recited in the scimed_patents the guide_wire does not enter the catheter at the proximal_end of the catheter i.e. the end closer to the surgeon but at a point nearer to the distal_end of the catheter i.e. the leading end of the catheter as it is inserted into the patient
the guide-wire_lumen is present only in the distal_portion of the catheter and does not extend the entire length of the catheter
the second lumen is the inflation_lumen
it extends through all sections of the catheter and terminates in a connection with the balloon
the balloon is inflated by forcing fluid into the inflation_lumen
the balloon then compresses the material restricting the artery thereby relieving the restriction

the parties agree that only two arrangements of the two lumens are known and practiced in the art
in the dual or adjacent lumen configuration the two lumens are positioned side-by-side within the catheter
in the coaxial_lumen_configuration the guide_wire_lumen runs inside the inflation_lumen ; in that configuration the inflation_lumen viewed in cross-section is annular in shape
the parties also agree that the accused acs devices employ only the dual_lumen_configuration and that the preferred_embodiment described in the scimed_patents employs the coaxial_lumen_configuration

based on language in the common written description portion of the three scimed_patents the district_court construed the asserted claims of the patents to be limited to catheters with coaxial_lumens and not to read on catheters with a dual_lumen_configuration
the court noted that` the language contained in scimeds specifications expressly limits all embodiments of the claimed invention to a coaxial structure'
the court focused in particular on language from the common_specification describing the coaxial_lumen_structure as the` basic_sleeve_structure for all embodiments of the present_invention contemplated and disclosed herein'
that language the court concluded` leaves no doubt that a person skilled in the art would conclude that the inventor envisioned only one design *1340 for the catheters taught in scimeds patents-an intermediate_sleeve_section containing two.. lumens arranged coaxially'

in light of the district_courts construction of the asserted claims scimed conceded that acss accused catheters did not literally infringe any of the asserted claims
in addition the court held on summary_judgment that the two lumen arrangements were sufficiently different that no reasonable_jury could find the accused catheters to infringe the scimed_patents under the doctrine of equivalents
scimed appeals the claim_construction and the summary_judgment based on that construction

ii
the principal question in this case is a narrow one whether the common_specification of the three patents limits the scope of the asserted claims to catheters with coaxial_lumens
there is nothing pertinent to this issue in the prosecution_history of the three patents ; the case turns entirely on an interpretation of the asserted claims in light of the specification which is essentially identical for each of the three patents
like the district_court we interpret the specification to disclaim the dual_lumen_configuration and to limit the scope of the asserted claims to catheters with coaxial_lumen_structures having annular_inflation_lumens
we therefore construe the asserted claims to read only on catheters with coaxial_lumens and not on catheters with dual or side-by-side_lumens

claim 19 of the ¡¬594_patent is representative of the asserted claims of the three patents in suit
it claims the following in an elongate dilatation catheter of the type that can be slidably moved along a guide_wire that can extend past a distal_end of the catheter wherein the guide_wire is received in a guide_wire_lumen of the catheter the guide_wire extending from a distal guide_wire_lumen opening to a proximal_guide_wire_lumen_opening disposed in a portion of the catheter that is spaced distally from a proximal_end of the catheter the dilatation catheter including an inflatable balloon and an inflation_lumen extending through the catheter separate from the guide_wire_lumen an improvement comprising a first proximal shaft section of the catheter defined by a relatively rigid metallic tube ; a second_shaft_section disposed distally of the first_shaft_section the second_shaft_section being relatively more flexible than the first_shaft_section ; and
a transition_section disposed between the first_shaft_section and the second_shaft_section the transition_section including a transition_member comprising a metallic element of gradually diminished dimension the transition_member extending adjacent to the proximal_guide_wire_lumen_opening and the transition_member having gradually decreasing rigidity in the distal direction to provide a relatively smooth transition between the first_shaft_section and the second_shaft_section

scimed argues at length that in construing the claims based on the written description the district_court has committed one of the cardinal sins of patent law-reading a limitation from the written description into the claims
see comark communications inc. v. harris corp. 156_f.3d_1182 1186 48_uspq2d_1001 1005 fed.cir.1998
but that is not an accurate characterization of what the district_court did
instead the district_court properly followed the invocation that` [ c ] laims must be read in view of the specification of which they are a part'
*1341 markman v. westview instruments 52_f.3d_967 979-980 34_uspq2d_1321 1329 fed.cir.1995 affd 517_u.s._370 116_s.ct._1384 134_l.ed.2d_577_(1996) ; see also united states v. adams 383_u.s._39 49 86_s.ct._708 15_l.ed.2d_572 148_uspq_479 482 1966` [ c ] laims are to be construed in light of the specifications and both are to be read with a view to ascertaining the invention
`` ; slimfold mfg co. v. kinkead indus. inc. 810_f.2d_1113 1116 1_uspq2d_1563 1566 fed.cir.1987` claims are not interpreted in a vacuum but are part of and are read in light of the specification
``

as this court has recently explained` [ o ] ne purpose for examining the specification is to determine if the patentee has limited the scope of the claims'
watts v. xl sys. inc. 232_f.3d_877 882 56_uspq2d_1836 1839 fed.cir.2000
where the specification makes clear that the invention does not include a particular feature that feature is deemed to be outside the reach of the claims of the patent even though the language of the claims read without reference to the specification might be considered broad enough to encompass the feature in question
thus in the watts case the claim in dispute recited pipe joints that could be` sealingly connected'
the court noted that the specification described only one method to achieve the sealing connection that is to misalign the taper_angles of the respective threads of the joined pipes
the court pointed out that the specification` actually limits the invention to structures that utilize misaligned taper_angles stating thatthe present_invention utilizes [ the varying taper angle ] feature
`` 232 f.3d at 883 56 uspq2d at 1840
in light of that statement the court construed the claim_language as limited to connections effected by misaligned taper_angles

another case in which the claims were given a narrow construction in light of the written description is wang_labs. inc. v. america online inc. 197_f.3d_1377 53_uspq2d_1161_(fed.cir.1999)
in that case the parties agreed that in general usage the claim_term` frame' could be applied both to` bit-mapped display systems' and to` character-based systems'
the court however construed the claims as limited to character-based systems
the court noted that the` only system that is described and enabled' in the patent specification` uses a character-based protocol' and that references to bit-mapped protocols did` not describe them as included in the applicants invention and that the specification would not be so understood by a person skilled in the field of the invention'
id.at 1382 53 uspq2d at 1164
citing modine manufacturing co. v. united states international trade commission 75_f.3d_1545 1551 37_uspq2d_1609 1612 fed.cir.1996 the court explained that` when thepreferred_embodiment is described as the invention itself the claims are not entitled to a broader scope than that embodiment'
197 f.3d at 1383 53 uspq2d at 1165

the court in cultor corp. v. a.e
staley manufacturing co. 224_f.3d_1328 56_uspq2d_1208_(fed.cir.2000) followed a similar analytical path
although the claim_language referred broadly to dissolving polydextrose in water the written description made clear that the water-soluble polydextrose referred to in the claims was polydextrose prepared using a citric_acid_catalyst
because the written description explicitly limited the subject_matter of the patent to a polydextrose purification process using a citric_acid_catalyst the court declined to hold that the asserted claims read on a process using a catalyst other than citric_acid even though the claims themselves did not refer to citric_acid
the explicit reference in the specification to the invention as a process limited to one prepared with the citric_acid_catalyst the court held` effected a disclaimer of the other prior_art acids
claims are not correctly construed to cover what was expressly *1342 disclaimed'
224 f.3d at 1331 56 uspq2d at 1210

in another similar case o.i
corp. v. tekmar co. 115_f.3d_1576 1581 42_uspq2d_1777 1781 fed.cir.1997 the patentee argued that the claim_term` passage' should be given its ordinary and accustomed meaning and that the district_court had erred by limiting the scope of the patent to the kind of` passage' employed in the preferred_embodiment
the court rejected that argument on two grounds
first it noted that` all of thepassage structures contemplated by the written description [ were ] either non-smooth or conical'
in addition the written description` expressly distinguishe [ d ] over prior_art passages by stating that those passages are generally smooth-walled'
id. 115_f.3d_1576 42 uspq2d at 1781
the court therefore concluded that` one skilled in the art reading the claims description and prosecution_history would conclude that the termpassage.. does not encompass a smooth-walled completely cylindrical structure'
id

finally we find instructive the analysis in toro co. v. white consolidated industries inc. 199_f.3d_1295 53_uspq2d_1065_(fed.cir.1999)
the patent at issue described and claimed a hand-held convertible vacuum-blower for vacuuming and blowing leaves and yard debris
in the claimed device the cover was fitted with a ring that restricted the size of the air inlet when the device was being used in blower mode
one of the questions before the court was whether the cover which the claim characterized as` including' a restriction_ring had to be permanently attached to the restriction_ring
to answer that question the court looked to the specification
the court observed that the specification and drawings showed the ring as part of and permanently attached to the cover and did not illustrate or describe any other structure
indeed the court pointed out the specification described the advantages of the unitary structure as important to the invention
based on the specification the court construed the term` including' in the asserted claims as requiring that the restriction_ring be attached to the cover
199 f.3d at 1302 53_uspq2d_1069 -70

the analysis in these cases is directly applicable to the claim_construction issue presented here
at various points the common_specification of the three patents indicates that the claimed invention uses coaxial rather than side-by-side_lumens i.e. that the guide_wire_lumen is contained within the inflation_lumen and that the inflation_lumen is annular
read together these portions of the common_specification lead to the inescapable conclusion that the references in the asserted claims to an inflation_lumen` separate from' the guide_wire_lumen must be understood as referring to coaxial_lumens and thus that the asserted claims read only on catheters having coaxial_lumens

first the abstract of each of the patents refers to the intermediate_sleeve_section of the invention as including` an inner_core_tube which defines a guide_wire_lumen'
the abstract adds that the inflation_lumen is` continued as an annular_inflation_lumen' through the sleeve_section of the catheter
thus from the outset the specification identifies the inflation_lumen as that term is used in the scimed_patents as annular i.e
coaxial rather than dual in structure

second in discussing the disadvantages of certain prior_art structures the written description of each of the patents explains that the prior_art_catheters with shortened guide_wire_lumens` suffer from several disadvantages'
the first cited disadvantage is that` [ s ] uch catheters have been one piece polyethylene catheters having dual_lumen_configurations adjacent their distal_regions
typically such catheters have larger than necessary_shaft_sizes and *1343 are stiffer in their distal_regions than would be desired..' ¡¬594_patent col._3,_ll._3-8 ; ¡¬482_patent col._3,_ll._5-10 ; ¡¬334_patent col._3,_ll._10-15
thus the scimed_patents distinguish the prior_art on the basis of the use of dual_lumens and point out the advantages of the coaxial_lumens used in the catheters that are the subjects of the scimed_patents
that discussion in the written description supports the district_courts conclusion that the claims should not be read so broadly as to encompass the distinguished prior_art structure
see e.g. tronzo v. biomet inc. 156_f.3d_1154 1159 47_uspq2d_1829 1833 fed.cir.1998 specification distinguished prior_art as inferior and touted advantages of a conical shaped cup for use in an artificial hip device ;` [ s ] uch statements make clear that the ¡¬589_patent discloses only conical shaped cups and nothing further' ; ekchian v. home depot inc. 104_f.3d_1299 1304 41_uspq2d_1364 1368 fed.cir.1997` [ s ] ince by distinguishing the claimed invention over the prior_art an applicant is indicating what the claims do not cover he is by implication surrendering such protection
``

third the` summary of the invention' portion of the patents describes` the present_invention' as having a sleeve_section with an inner_core_tube having a guide_wire_lumen extending through it and an outer_sleeve defining` a longitudinally extending annular_inflation_lumen'
¡¬594_patent col._3,_ll._33-45 ; ¡¬482_patent col._3,_ll._34-46 ; ¡¬334_patent col._3,_ll._40-52
the characterization of the` present_invention' includes several more references to the` annular_inflation_lumen' as well see ¡¬594_patent col._3,_ll._58-59 61 col._4,_ll._43-44 ; ¡¬482_patent col._3,_ll._59-60 62 col._4,_ll._45-46 ; ¡¬334_patent col._3,_ll._65 68 col._4,_ll._51-52 and the` conclusion' section of the written description again refers to the` guide_wire_lumen and annular_inflation_lumen' in the distal_portions of the catheter
¡¬594_patent col._14,_ll._26-28 ; ¡¬482_patent col._14,_ll._31-33 ; ¡¬334_patent col._3,_ll._41-44
as in the wang_labs and modine cases cited above the characterization of the coaxial configuration as part of the` present_invention' is strong evidence that the claims should not be read to encompass the opposite structure

the most compelling portion of the specification and the portion on which the district_court principally focused is the passage in the section entitled` catheter intermediate sleeve section' in which the inflation_lumen is described as annular in structure being formed from an outer_sleeve or tube the inflation_lumen and an inner_core_tube the guide_wire_lumen
see ¡¬ 594 patent col._7,_ll._26-28 63-65 ; ¡¬482_patent col._7,_ll._29-31 66-68 ; ¡¬334_patent col._7,_ll._41-43 col._8,_ll._10-12
the patents then recite the intermediate sleeve structure defined above is the basic_sleeve_structure for all embodiments of the present_invention contemplated and disclosed herein-namely an inner_core_tube bonded to a distal_portion of the main_catheter_shaft with an outer_sleeve forming an annular_continuation of the inflation_lumen through the main_shaft between the core_tube and outer_sleeve
as discussed below and illustrated herein various configurations of the connections and components relative to the formation of the distal guide_wire_lumen including the coupling of the main_shaft to the intermediate_sleeve_section are contemplated
'594_patent col._8,_ll._3-14 ; ¡¬482_patent col._8,_ll._6-17 ; ¡¬334_patent col._8,_ll._18-29 emphasis added

this language defines scimeds invention in a way that excludes the dual or side-by-side lumen arrangement
scimed argues that the references to the annular_inflation_lumen are meant only to refer to the preferred_embodiment of the invention and not to indicate that the claims should *1344 be construed as limited to a structure employing coaxial_lumens
that argument however flies in the face of the many statements in the written description that define` the invention' as employing a coaxial_lumen_structure and distinguish the prior_art in part on the ground that it used a dual_lumen_structure which had the disadvantage of making the shaft sizes of the catheters larger than necessary and making the catheters` stiffer in their distal_regions than would be desired'
¡¬594_patent col._3,_ll._3-9 ; ¡¬482_patent col._3,_ll._5-11 ; ¡¬334_patent col._3,_ll._10-16
scimeds argument is particularly unconvincing in the face of its own statement in the written description that the structure containing coaxial_lumens` namely an inner_core_tube bonded to a distal_portion of the main_catheter_shaft with an outer_sleeve forming an annular_continuation of the inflation_lumen through the main_shaft between the core_tube and the outer_sleeve' is` the basic_sleeve_structure for all embodiments of the present_invention contemplated and disclosed herein'
¡¬ 594 patent col._8,_ll._4-9 ; ¡¬482_patent col._8,_ll._7-12 ; ¡¬334_patent col._8,_ll._19-24
that characterization of the invention can not reasonably be interpreted as limited to the preferred_embodiment as scimed argues but is expressly made applicable to` all embodiments of the present_invention'

the words` all embodiments of the present_invention' are broad and unequivocal
it is difficult to imagine how the patents could have been clearer in making the point that the coaxial_lumen_configuration was a necessary element of every variant of the claimed invention
moreover there is no suggestion that the patentee made that statement unaware of the alternative dual_lumen_configuration because earlier in the patent the patentee had distinguished the dual_lumen_configuration used in prior_art devices as having disadvantages that the coaxial_lumens used in the patented invention had overcome
see ¡¬594_patent col._3,_ll._1-22 ; ¡¬482_patent col._3,_ll._3-24 ; ¡¬334_patent col._3,_ll._8-29
( describing the dual_lumen_configuration
this is therefore a clear case of disclaimer of subject_matter that absent the disclaimer could have been considered to fall within the scope of the claim_language

citing renishaw plc v. marposs societa per azioni 158_f.3d_1243 1248 48_uspq2d_1117 1121 fed.cir.1998 and johnson worldwide assocs
v. zebco corp. 175_f.3d_985 989-90 50_uspq2d_1607 1610 fed.cir.1999 scimed argues that the only way in which statements in the written description can restrict the scope of a claim is by setting forth a specific narrowing definition for a particular claim_term
as indicated by the cases discussed above such as watts wang_labs cultor and tekmar scimeds characterization of the role of the written description is too narrow
see e.g. phonometrics inc. v. northern_telecom_inc. 133_f.3d_1459 1466 45_uspq2d_1421 1426-27 fed.cir.1998 ; gen._am transp corp. v. cryo-trans inc. 93_f.3d_766 769-70 39_uspq2d_1801 1803-04 fed.cir.1996 ; carroll touch inc. v. electro mech
see e.g. phonometrics inc. v. northern_telecom_inc. 133_f.3d_1459 1466 45_uspq2d_1421 1426-27 fed.cir.1998 ; gen._am
sys. inc. 15_f.3d_1573 1577-78 27_uspq2d_1837 1840-41 fed.cir.1993 ; minn. mining & mfg co. v. johnson & johnson orthopaedics inc. 976_f.2d_1559 1566 1567 fed.cir.1992
in this case the written description makes clear that when the asserted claims refer to the respective locations of the guide_wire and inflation_lumens and in particular *1345 when the claims refer to the inflation_lumen as` extending through the catheter separate from' the guide_wire_lumen the claim_language refers to coaxial_lumens

because the three scimed_patents make clear that the lumens referred to in the claims are all coaxial in structure the district_court was correct to construe the patents as disclaiming the dual_lumen_configuration
under such a construction scimed concedes that no literal_infringement can be found
the district_court therefore properly entered summary_judgment in favor of acs on the issue of literal_infringement

iii
in a separate opinion the district_court rejected scimeds argument that acss accused devices infringed the three asserted patents under the doctrine of equivalents
we agree with the court that the doctrine of equivalents is inapplicable in this case and that the district_court properly granted summary_judgment to acs on that issue

as noted above the common_specification of scimeds patents referred to prior_art_catheters identified them as using the dual_lumen_configuration and criticized them as suffering from the disadvantages of having` larger than necessary_shaft_sizes' and being` stiffer in their distal_regions than would be desired'
¡¬594_patent col._3,_ll._6-8 ; ¡¬482_patent col._3,_ll._8-10 ; ¡¬334_patent col._3,_ll._13-15
that criticism of the dual_lumen_configuration was consistent with the evidence from scimed witnesses and documents which noted the advantages of the coaxial_lumen_configuration in increasing the flexibility of catheters and their ability to track through the coronary arterial system
the disclaimer of dual_lumens was made even more explicit in the portion of the written description in which the patentee identified coaxial_lumens as the configuration used in` all embodiments of the present_invention'

having specifically identified criticized and disclaimed the dual_lumen_configuration the patentee can not now invoke the doctrine of equivalents to` embrace a structure that was specifically excluded from the claims'
dolly inc. v. spalding & evenflo cos. 16_f.3d_394 400 29_uspq2d_1767 1771 fed.cir.1994
a particular structure can be deemed outside the reach of the doctrine of equivalents because that structure is clearly excluded from the claims whether the exclusion is express or implied
in moore u.s.a. inc. v. standard register co. 229_f.3d_1091 56_uspq2d_1225_(fed.cir.2000) for example the court considered a claim to a mailer-type business form in which the longitudinal_strips of adhesive extend` the majority of the lengths' of the longitudinal margins of the form
the patentee argued that the accused form in which the longitudinal_strips of adhesive extended a minority of the length of the longitudinal margin of the form infringed under the doctrine of equivalents
the court rejected the argument holding that` it would defy logic to conclude that a minority-the very antithesis of a majority-could be insubstantially different from a claim_limitation requiring a majority and no reasonable juror could find otherwise'
229 f.3d at 1106 56 uspq2d at 1236
similarly in eastman kodak co. v. goodyear tire & rubber co. 114_f.3d_1547 42_uspq2d_1737_(fed.cir.1997) the patent claimed a process that included crystallizing a particular substance at high temperature` under an inert_gas_atmosphere'
the patentee argued that certain of the accused processes which used` heated air' rather than` an inert_gas_atmosphere' infringed under the doctrine of equivalents
the court rejected that argument explaining that` the claim_language specifically excludes reactive gases-such asheated air'-from the scope of the claims' and in light of that *1346 specific_exclusion the accused processes could not infringe under the doctrine of equivalents
114 f.3d at 1561 42 uspq2d at 1747
in each of these cases by defining the claim in a way that clearly excluded certain subject_matter the patent implicitly disclaimed the subject_matter that was excluded and thereby barred the patentee from asserting infringement under the doctrine of equivalents

the court did effectively the same thing in sage products inc. v. devon industries inc. 126_f.3d_1420 44_uspq2d_1103_(fed.cir.1997)
in that case the claim was to a syringe disposal container having an elongated slot at the top of the container body and a` first constriction extending over said slot'
although those limitations did not literally read on the accused device the patentee argued that the device infringed under the doctrine of equivalents
the court rejected that argument noting that the claim
defines a relatively simple structural device
no subtlety of language or complexity of the technology nor any subsequent change in the state of the art such as later-developed technology obfuscated the significance of this limitation at the time of its incorporation into the claim..
if sage desired broad patent_protection for any container that performed a function similar to its claimed container it could have sought claims with fewer structural encumbrances.. [ a ] s between the patentee who had a clear opportunity to negotiate broader claims but did not do so and the public at large it is the patentee who must bear the cost of its failure to seek protection for this foreseeable alteration of its claimed structure
126 f.3d at 1425 44 uspq2d at 1107
thus the court determined that because the scope of the claim was limited in a way that plainly and necessarily excluded a structural feature that was the opposite of the one recited in the claim that different structure could not be brought within the scope of patent_protection through the doctrine of equivalents
see ethicon endo-surgery inc. v. u.s. surgical corp. 149_f.3d_1309 1317 47_uspq2d_1272 1277 fed.cir.1998 subject_matter is` specifically excluded' from coverage under the doctrine of equivalents if its inclusion is` inconsistent with the language of the claim'

finally in athletic_alternatives inc. v. prince manufacturing inc. 73_f.3d_1573 37_uspq2d_1365_(fed.cir.1996) the court addressed a claim directed to a system for stringing tennis rackets with splayed strings
the court construed the claim to require that the stringing system produce rackets with at least three different splay-creating offset_distances for the strings
having construed the claim in that manner the court held that for purposes of the doctrine of equivalents` the properly construed claim can not have an equivalent in a racket with only two offset_distances' i.e. the two-distance splayed string system was` specifically excluded from the scope of the claims'

`` ; wiener v. nec elecs. inc. 102_f.3d_534 541 41_uspq2d_1023 1029 fed.cir.1996 doctrine of equivalents does not extend to an accused device in which` the required structure is specifically excluded' by the patent

the principle articulated in these cases is akin to the familiar rule that the doctrine of equivalents can not be employed in a manner that wholly vitiates a claim_limitation
see *1347 warner-jenkinson co. v. hilton davis chem co. 520_u.s._17 29-30 117_s.ct._1040 137_l.ed.2d_146_(1997) ; athletic_alternatives 73 f.3d at 1582 37 uspq2d at 1373` specific_exclusion' principle is` a corollary to theall limitations rule'
thus if a patent states that the claimed device must be` non-metallic' the patentee can not assert the patent against a metallic_device on the ground that a metallic_device is equivalent to a non-metallic_device
the unavailability of the doctrine of equivalents could be explained either as the product of an impermissible vitiation of the` non-metallic' claim_limitation or as the product of a clear and binding statement to the public that metallic structures are excluded from the protection of the patent
as the court made clear in sage the foreclosure of reliance on the doctrine of equivalents in such a case depends on whether the patent clearly excludes the asserted equivalent structure either implicitly or explicitly

in that respect this case is an even stronger one for not applying the doctrine of equivalents than cases such as dolly sage eastman kodak moore and athletic_alternatives
each of the scimed_patents specifically recognized and disclaimed the dual_lumen_structure making clear that the patentee regarded the dual_lumen_configuration as significantly inferior to the coaxial_lumen_configuration used in the invention
where such an explicit disclaimer is present the principles of those cases apply a fortiori and the patentee can not be allowed to recapture the excluded subject_matter under the doctrine of equivalents without undermining the notice function of the patent
as the court observed in sage the patentee had an opportunity to draft the patent in a way that would make clear that dual_lumens as well as coaxial_lumens were within the scope of the invention but the patentee did just the opposite leaving competitors and the public to draw the reasonable conclusion that the patentee was not seeking patent_protection for catheters that used a dual_lumen_configuration
under these circumstances the district_court was justified in concluding that a reasonable_jury could not find that the accused devices infringe the scimed_patents under the doctrine of equivalents

affirmed

dyk circuit_judge concurring
on the facts of this particular case i agree with the result reached by the majority and i join the opinion
i also agree with the majority that` the written description can provide guidance as to the meaning of the claims thereby dictating the manner in which the claims are to be construed even if the guidance is not provided in explicit definitional format'
the problem is that our decisions provide inadequate guidance as to when it is appropriate to look to the specification to narrow the claim by interpretation and when it is not appropriate to do so
until we provide better guidance i fear that the lower courts and litigants will remain confused
