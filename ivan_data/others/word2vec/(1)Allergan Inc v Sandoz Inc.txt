background
i. glaucoma is an eye disease associated with elevated_intraocular_pressure` iop'
treatments that effectively reduce iop can slow the progression of the disease
if left untreated however elevated iop can damage the optic nerve and lead to permanent vision loss and blindness
in 2001 the u.s. food and drug administration the` fda' approved lumiganthe_r 0.03 %` lumigan 0.03 %' a once-daily topical solution developed by allergan for treating open angle glaucoma and ocular_hypertension
lumigan 0.03 % contains 0.03 % by weight of bimatoprost and 50 parts per million` ppm' benzalkonium chloride` bak' among other ingredients

bimatoprost the active ingredient in lumigan 0.03 % is a prostaglandin analog that effectively lowers iop but can cause hyperemia i.e. red eye when administered to the ocular_surface
one structural difference between bimatoprost and two other prostaglandin analogs that were approved for treating glaucoma at the time of its approval xalatanthe_r latanoprost and travatanthe_r travoprost is that bimatoprost contains an amide instead of an ester as in latanoprost and travoprost
opinion at 7-8
it was understood that both latanoprost and travoprost but not bimatoprost act as prodrugs of the corresponding acids
id

bak is a preservative for inhibiting bacterial growth in ophthalmic solutions
it was known however that bak is cytotoxic and that it can damage the cells on the ocular_surface and cause undesirable side_effects

although lumigan 0.03 %_was effective at lowering iop it also caused frequent and severe_hyperemia
many patients thus stopped using it without consulting their physicians which led to gradual vision loss
to address that problem allergan explored a number of alternative formulations of bimatoprost and surprisingly discovered that increasing the concentration of bak from 50 ppm to 200 ppm significantly increased the corneal_permeability of bimatoprost
id.at 12-13
after further research allergan developed lumiganthe_r 0.01 %` lumigan 0.01 %'

lumigan 0.01 % is a topical solution containing 0.01 %_bimatoprost and 200 ppm_bak ; otherwise it has the same ingredients as lumigan 0.03 %
thus as compared with lumigan 0.03 % lumigan 0.01 % has a three-fold lower bimatoprost concentration *1299 and a four-fold higher bak concentration
clinical studies showed that lumigan 0.01 % has similar_efficacy to lumigan 0.03 % viz. iop-lowering within 0.5 mmhg of that of lumigan 0.03 % but it causes less frequent and severe_hyperemia than lumigan 0.03 %
id.at 20-21
in 2010 the fda approved allergans new drug application for lumigan 0.01 % for the same approved uses as lumigan 0.03 %

ii
allergan owns the ¡¬504 ¡¬353 ¡¬118 ¡¬605 and ¡¬479_patent s which are all listed in the fdas approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations commonly known as the` orange book' as claiming lumigan 0.01 % and its approved uses
after allergan received fda-approval of lumigan 0.01 % sandoz lupin hi-tech and watson each submitted an abbreviated new drug application` anda' to the fda seeking approval to engage in the commercial manufacture use importation sale or offer for sale of generic versions of lumigan 0.01 % prior to the expiration of the ¡¬504 ¡¬353 ¡¬118 ¡¬605 and ¡¬ 479 patents
in response allergan sued each of the anda_applicants in the united_states_district_court for the eastern_district of texas asserting that their anda filings infringed those patents
the district_court consolidated those actions into one case

the asserted patents all derive from an application filed on march_16,_2005 and share a common specification
the patents are entitled` enhanced bimatoprost ophthalmic solution' ¡¬504_patent_col. 1_ll._1 -2,3 and refer to what is lumigan 0.03 % in the background section id
col. 1_ll._34 -36
the specifications of the patents describe a composition comprising 0.005 % to 0.02 %_bimatoprost and 100 ppm to 250 ppm_bak which is an aqueous_liquid` formulated for ophthalmic_administration' and` useful in treating glaucoma or ocular_hypertension'
id
col. 1_ll._61 -67
the specifications also specifically describe a formulation comprising 0.01 %_bimatoprost and 200 ppm_bak among other formulations as a` best_mode' of the invention
id
col. 2_ll._59 64-67

additionally the specifications disclose in vitro and in vivo experimental data in rabbits showing that increasing the concentration of bak from 50 ppm to 200 ppm significantly increased the permeability of bimatoprost across ocular_membranes
id
col. 4_ll._10 -58 col. 5_l._19 -col. 6_l._5 figs
1 & 2
finally in a constructive_example the specifications describe the once-daily ophthalmic_administration to a glaucoma patient of a formulation containing 0.015 %_bimatoprost 125 ppm_bak and 0.015 % edta stating that` intraocular_pressure drops more and less_hyperemia is observed than would be observed for [ a formulation containing 0.03 %_bimatoprost and 50 ppm_bak ]' and` [ l ] owered intraocular_pressure persists for as long as the treatment continues'

allergan asserted the following claims against each of the anda_applicants claim 2 of the ¡¬504_patent ; claim 15 of the ¡¬479_patent ; claims 1 6 10 and 12 of the ¡¬605_patent ; claims 1 7 and 8 of the ¡¬ 353 patent ; and claims 1 7 and 8 of the ¡¬118_patent collectively` the asserted claims'
those claims collectively are directed to compositions comprising bimatoprost and bak and methods of using them to treat glaucoma or to lower iop

*1300 each of the asserted claims requires a composition comprising 0.01 %_bimatoprost and 200 ppm_bak
claim 2 of the ¡¬504_patent claim 15 of the ¡¬ 479 patent and claims 1 6 10 and 12 of the ¡¬605_patent collectively` the group_i claims' further require the composition to have a ph of` about 7.3'

*1301 iii
the district_court held a five-day bench_trial in july 2013 on the issues of obviousness and infringement
the defendants also argued that the claims were invalid for lack of written description and enablement in pre-and post-trial briefings
in january 2014 the court rendered its findings of fact and conclusions of law on all of those issues

a
the district_court concluded that the asserted claims would not have been obvious in view of the cited prior_art which included 1 u.s._patent 5,688,819` woodward' ; 2 u.s._patent 6,933,289` lyons' ; 3 laibovitz et al. comparison of the ocular hypotensive lipid agn 192024 with timolol 119 archives of ophthalmology 994 2001` laibovitz' ; 4 abelson et al. how to handle bak talk rev
of ophthalmology dec. 2002 at 52-54` abelson' ; 5 lee et al. review topical ocular drug delivery recent developments and future challenges 2 j. ocular pharmacology 67 1986` lee' ; 6 camber et al. factors influencing the corneal permeability of prostaglandin f2a and its isopropyl ester in vitro 37 int l_j._pharmaceutics 27 1987` camber' ; 7 higaki et al. estimation and enhancement of in vitro corneal transport of s-1033 a novel antiglaucoma medication 132 int l_j._pharmaceutics 165 1996` higaki' ; and 8 keller et al. increased corneal permeability induced by the dual effects of transient tear film acidification and exposure to ben-zalkonium chloride 30 experimental eye res
203 1980` keller'

specifically with respect to the scope and content of the prior_art the district_court found that 1 ophthalmic_formulation was unpredictable and it was not a field with a finite number of identified and predictable solutions opinion at 29-31 ; 2 laibovitz and lyons both taught that reducing bimatoprost from 0.03 % to 0.01 %_would result in less iop-lowering efficacy id.at 31-34 ; 3 laibovitz also taught that reducing bimatoprost from 0.03 % to 0.01 %_would not result in less_hyperemia and lyons did not suggest the contrary id.at 34-35 ; 4 the cited prior_art including higaki camber lee keller and abelson as well as xalatanthe_r latanoprost which contains 200 ppm_bak did not teach that high_concentrations of bak would enhance the corneal_permeability of bimatoprost a neutral prostaglandin amide analog ; instead the prior_art suggested that bak would decrease the permeability of a neutral prostaglandin analog id.at 35 38-47 ; and 5 the prior_art taught that bak should be minimized in ophthalmic_formulations due to its toxicity and in particular taught away from using 200 ppm_bak in a bimatoprost_formulation because bak was known to cause side_effects including increased iop hyperemia and dry_eye making it unsuitable for chronic_use at high_concentrations id.at 47-54

the district_court then found that there would not have been a reason to pursue the claimed invention or a reasonable_expectation of success if it were pursued
id.at 55-56
the court also found evidence of long-felt need unexpected_results and commercial_success supporting a conclusion of nonobviousness
id.at 56-59
the court specifically found that it was unexpected that lumigan 0.01 %_would reduce the incidence and severity of hyperemia as compared to lumigan 0.03 % while maintaining iop-lowering efficacy and that it was also unexpected that 200 ppm_bak would enhance the permeability of *1302 bimatoprost to such an extent so as to allow the reduction of the bimatoprost concentration from 0.03 % to 0.01 %_without loss of efficacy
id.at 57-58

in view of those factual_findings the district_court concluded that the asserted claims would not have been obvious
id.at 74
in reaching that conclusion the court emphasized that the prior_art taught away from the claimed invention because it taught` 1 that bimatoprost lost efficacy as its concentration decreased ; 2 that bak had no impact on bimatoprosts permeability ; and 3 that bak was cytotoxic and could cause corneal disorders therefore encouraging the elimination or reduction in the concentration of bak'
id.at 74-75

the district_court also rejected the defendants argument raised in post-trial briefings that our decision in galderma laboratories l.p. v. tolmar inc. 737_f.3d_731_(fed.cir.2013) compels a conclusion of obviousness in this case
the defendants argued that woodward disclosed a formulation comprising 0.001 % -1 %_bimatoprost and 0-1000 ppm_bak for treating glaucoma and that the amounts of bimatoprost and bak in the claimed formulation fall within those prior_art_ranges thus rendering the claims obvious
the district_court reasoned that` allergan has met its burden of producing rebuttal evidence i.e.that 1 the prior_art taught away from the claimed invention ; 2 there were new and unexpected_results relative to the prior_art ; or 3 there are other_pertinent_secondary_considerations
`` opinion at 75 quoting galderma 737 f.3d at 738
the court again emphasized that the prior_art taught away from 200 ppm_bak noting that the defendants own_expert dr
samples had serious concerns about bak and strongly warned against its use
id.at 75-76
the court also emphasized that the unexpected_results were` of a different kind not just of different degree'
id.at 76 emphases in original

the district_court thus concluded that the defendants failed to prove by clear and convincing_evidence that the asserted claims would have been obvious
id.at 77

b
the district_court also rejected the defendants invalidity challenges based on the written description and enablement_requirements which they raised only in pre-and post-trial briefings
id.at 77-81
the court noted that the defendants` did not present any evidence or argument' on those issues at trial
id.at 77 79

specifically the defendants alleged that the group_ii_claims which recite clinical_profile_limitations were invalid for lack of an adequate written description
the district_court found however that the patents explicitly describe the formulation of lumigan 0.01 % and that lumigan 0.01 % has the clinical_profile recited in the group_ii_claims
id.at 78
the court also found additional support in the titles of the patents the disclosed in vitro and in vivo permeability_data of bimatoprost as well as the constructive_example comparing the iop-lowering efficacy and hyperemia_profile of a test formulation to that of lumigan 0.03 %
the court therefore found that the group_ii_claims have adequate written description support` especially given the express disclosure that lumigan 0.01 % is an example of the best_mode of the invention'
id
the court additionally reasoned that the inventors had possession of the claimed invention because a clinical_protocol prepared in november 2004 before the march 2005 application filing date describes *1303 the formulation of lumigan 0.01 % and the later-claimed clinical_profile
id.at 79

lupin also alleged that the asserted claims were invalid for lack of enablement
the district_court rejected that argument reasoning that allergans patents disclose the formulation of lumigan 0.01 % and that the patents disclosure would enable one of ordinary_skill in the art to make and use the claimed invention without undue_experimentation
id.at 80-81

c. the district_court also found that each of the anda_products infringed each of the asserted claims
relevant to this appeal the court found that hi-techs anda_product infringed the group_i claims which require the claimed composition to have a ph of` about 7.3'
before trial the parties agreed to construe a` ph of about 7.3' as a` ph of approximately 7.3' and the court adopted that construction
allergan inc. v. sandoz_inc. no._611-cv-00441 2013_wl_139350 at *9 e.d.tex
jan._10,_2013
hi-techs anda specified that its proposed product has a ph of 6.8-7.2 during the products shelf_life
opinion at 27
after considering the evidence presented at trial the court found that hi-techs anda_product literally infringed the group_i claims
id.at 64
the court also found in the alternative that hi-techs anda_product infringed the group_i claims under the doctrine of equivalents
id.at 64-66

accordingly the district_court entered final judgment of infringement and no invalidity
the appellants timely appealed to this court ; we have jurisdiction under 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

discussion
following a bench_trial we review a district_courts conclusions of law de novo and its findings of fact for clear_error
golden blount inc. v. robert h. peterson co. 365_f.3d_1054 1058 fed.cir.2004
a factual finding is clearly erroneous if despite some supporting evidence we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made
united states v. u.s. gypsum co. 333_u.s._364 395 68_s.ct._525 92_l.ed._746_(1948) ; alza corp. v. mylan labs. inc. 464_f.3d_1286 1289 fed.cir.2006

furthermore patents are presumed to be valid and overcoming that presumption requires clear and convincing_evidence
35 u.s.c.¡± 282 ; microsoft corp. v. i4i ltd. p'ship 564 u.s. -- -- 131_s.ct._2238 2242 180_l.ed.2d_131_(2011)

i
we first consider the appellants arguments contending that the district_court erred in concluding that the asserted claims would not have been obvious

a patent claim is invalid as obvious if an alleged infringer proves that the differences between the claimed subject_matter and the prior_art are such that the subject_matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time of invention to a person having ordinary_skill in the art
35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a 2006
obviousness is ultimately a question of law premised on underlying issues of fact including 1 the scope and content of the prior_art ; 2 the level of ordinary_skill in the pertinent art ; 3 the differences between the claimed invention and the prior_art ; and 4 objective_evidence such as commercial_success long-felt need and the failure of others
ksr int l co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 427 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007) ; *1304 graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 17-18 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966) ; monarch knitting mach corp. v. sulzer morat gmbh 139_f.3d_877 881 fed.cir.1998

the appellants argue that the district_court erred as a matter of law by requiring them to establish a motivation to pursue the claimed formulation by modifying lumigan 0.03 % and a reasonable_expectation of success in doing so
according to the appellants because the claimed amounts of bimatoprost and bak fall within prior_art_ranges the proper obviousness inquiry should focus only on teaching away unexpected_results and other_objective_indicia
the appellants also assert that the district_court applied an incorrect standard for teaching away because it merely found that the prior_art taught that the claimed formulation would be inferior rather than that it would not work
and they argue that the prior_art does not teach away from 0.01 %_bimatoprost or 200 ppm_bak
they assert moreover that there are no unexpected_results because the observed results of similar_efficacy and less_hyperemia are only a difference in degree not a difference in kind
they also argue that those results are the inherent_properties of an otherwise obvious_formulation
finally they argue that the district_court erred in finding other_objective_indicia as supporting nonobviousness

allergan responds that this appeal turns on disputed facts and that the district_court did not clearly err in finding those facts in allergans favor including finding that the prior_art taught that 1 0.01 %_bimatoprost would be less efficacious than 0.03 %_bimatoprost ; 2 bak would decrease the permeability of bimatoprost ; and 3 200 ppm_bak would be unsafe for chronic_use with bimatoprost
allergan contends that the appellants should not on appeal fault the district_court for approaching the issue of obviousness in the way they argued it during trial
allergan maintains that it would not have been obvious to modify lumigan 0.03 % to make the claimed formulation or to select the claimed amounts of bimatoprost and bak from two very broad prior_art_ranges
allergan also responds that in any event the district_court did not err in finding teaching away unexpected_results and other_objective_indicia which fully supported the courts conclusion of nonobviousness

we agree with allergan that the district_court did not err in concluding that the asserted claims would not have been obvious
that conclusion is supported by underlying factual_findings which are not clearly erroneous on this record
in particular the district_court did not clearly err in finding that the prior_art taught away from a formulation comprising 0.01 %_bimatoprost and 200 ppm_bak and that such a formulation exhibited unexpected_results

it is undisputed that the asserted claims all require a formulation comprising 0.01 %_bimatoprost and 200 ppm_bak
although the prior_art does not teach that particular combination of amounts of bimatoprost and bak those amounts do fall within the ranges disclosed in a single reference woodward discloses a composition comprising 0.001 % -1 %_bimatoprost and 0-1000 ppm of a preservative including bak
those disclosed ranges also encompass lumigan 0.03 % a prior_art commercial embodiment which contains 0.03 %_bimatoprost and 50 ppm_bak

as we explained in galderma where there is a range disclosed in the prior_art and the claimed invention falls *1305 within that range a relevant inquiry is whether there would have been a motivation to select the claimed composition from the prior_art_ranges
galderma 737 f.3d at 737-38 prior_art disclosing 0.01 % -1 %_adapalene encompassing the claimed composition comprising 0.3 %_adapalene
in those circumstances` the burden of production falls upon the patentee to come forward with evidence that 1 the prior_art taught away from the claimed invention ; 2 there were new and unexpected_results relative to the prior_art ; or 3 there are other_pertinent_secondary_considerations'
id.at 738

here in this case the prior_art_ranges are broader than the range in galderma and the record shows that the claimed amounts of the two different ingredients could and did materially and unpredictably alter the property of the claimed formulation
thus galderma does not compel a conclusion of obviousness in this case
it may also be true here that` the disclosed range [ s are ] so broad as to encompass a very large number of possible distinct compositions' in re peterson 315_f.3d_1325 1330_n._1_(fed.cir.2003) such that they do not teach any specific_amounts or combinations and that the burden of producing evidence of teaching away unexpected_results and other_pertinent_secondary_considerations did not shift to allergan
but we need not decide that issue as it would not affect our affirmance of the district_courts conclusion of nonobviousness because as indicated infra we conclude that the district_court did not clearly err in finding that allergan had produced ample evidence of teaching away and unexpected_results and that such evidence fully supports a conclusion of nonobviousness

`` whether the prior_art teaches away from the claimed invention is a question of fact'
spectralytics inc. v. cordis corp. 649_f.3d_1336 1343 fed.cir.2011
`` a reference may be said to teach away when a person of ordinary_skill upon reading the reference would be discouraged from following the path set out in the reference or would be led in a direction divergent from the path that was taken by the applicant'
in re gurley 27_f.3d_551 553 fed.cir.1994

the district_court did not clearly err in finding that the prior_art taught away from using 200 ppm_bak in a bimatoprost_formulation
as the district_court found the prior_art taught that bak should be minimized in ophthalmic_formulations to avoid safety problems
opinion at 49
indeed the appellants own_expert summarized the prior_arts widespread concern by describing bak as` a natural-born killer' that was` from satan'
id.at 75-76
specifically as the district_court found in great detail bak was known to cause increased iop hyperemia dry_eye and damage to corneal cells and to exacerbate other eye disorders

it is not clearly erroneous to find that those known side_effects would have discouraged a person of ordinary_skill from using higher concentrations of bak in a bimatoprost_formulation especially when 50 ppm_bak was known to be an adequate preservative in lumigan 0.03 %

while it is true that the prior_art such as abelson also disclosed ophthalmic_formulations containing 200 ppm_bak the district_court correctly found that those formulations with the exception of xalatanthe_r and xalacom were` not for chronic long-term use' and` would teach nothing about whether it was safe to use 200 ppm_bak with a lifelong glaucoma drug'
id.at 53 emphasis added
with respect to xalatanthe_r and xalacom both of which contain *1306 200 ppm_bak and latanoprost a prostaglandin ester analog the district_court found that` the majority of bak in solution complexed with latanoprost and was not free in solution to interact with the epithelial cells' id.at 40 53-54 ; and moreover that xalatanthe_r` showed a decrease in cell membrane integrity and a significant increase in apoptosis' as compared to a formulation with less bak which would have discouraged the skilled_artisan from increasing the amount of bak in a bimatoprost_formulation id.at 52
those factual_findings are not clearly erroneous

moreover the district_court did not clearly err in finding that the prior_art taught that bak would not increase the permeability of bimatoprost but might instead decrease it
id.at 35 38-47
the district_court found that higaki and camber taught that bak reduced the permeability of uncharged prostaglandin analogs that are similar to bimatoprost id.at 38-40 and that the other cited references including lee keller and abelson did not teach that bak would enhance the permeability of bimatoprost because those references studied large charged or hydrophilic molecules that are dissimilar to bimatoprost id.at 41-47
in view of those factual_findings there would not have been a reason to use 200 ppm_bak in a bimatoprost_formulation
see depuy spine inc. v. medtronic sofamor danek inc. 567_f.3d_1314 1326 fed.cir.2009` an inference of nonobviousness is especially strong where the prior_arts teachings undermine the very reason being proffered as to why a person of ordinary_skill would have combined the known elements
``

the record thus shows that the prior_art` criticize [ d ] discredit [ ed ] or otherwise discourage [ d ]' the use of 200 ppm_bak in a bimatoprost_formulation
in re mouttet 686_f.3d_1322 1334 fed.cir.2012 quoting in re fulton 391_f.3d_1195 1201 fed.cir.2004
we therefore need not address the appellants additional argument that the district_court erred in finding that laibovitz and lyons taught away from 0.01 %_bimatoprost
the appellants do not argue and there is no evidence to suggest that laibovitz and lyons favored using 200 ppm_bak in a bimatoprost_formulation
accordingly we conclude that the district_court did not clearly err in finding that the prior_art taught away from the claimed formulation

we also conclude that the district_court did not clearly err in finding that the claimed formulation exhibited` unexpected_results' which differed in kind not just in degree from the prior_art
opinion at 57-58 76
as indicated the prior_art taught that 200 ppm_bak would either have no impact on the permeability of bimatoprost or decrease it
allergans inventors surprisingly determined that the opposite was true namely that 200 ppm_bak enhanced the permeability of bimatoprost
that is an unexpected_difference in kind that supports nonobviousness
in re applied materials inc. 692_f.3d_1289 1298 fed.cir.2012` evidence that the variables interacted in an unpredictable or unexpected way could render the combination nonobvious'
( citing ksr 550 u.s. at 421 127_s.ct._1727

moreover the district_court properly found that laibovitz taught that reducing bimatoprost from 0.03 % to 0.01 % resulted in significantly reduced efficacy opinion at 31-33 but that such a reduction in bimatoprost did not result in less_hyperemia id.at 34
the claimed formulation which comprises 0.01 %_bimatoprost and *1307 200 ppm_bak unexpectedly maintained the iop-lowering efficacy of lumigan 0.03 % while exhibiting reduced incidence and severity of hyperemia even though the prior_art taught that bak could cause hyperemia at high_concentrations
those results exhibited by the claimed formulation thus constitute an unexpected_difference in kind viz. the difference between an effective and safe drug and one with significant side_effects that caused many patients to discontinue treatment

finally we reject the appellants argument that the unexpected_results do not support nonobviousness because they are merely the inherent_properties of an otherwise obvious_formulation
as indicated the prior_art did not disclose either explicitly or implicitly the claimed formulation ; rather it taught away from such a formulation
a person of ordinary_skill in the art thus would not have had a reason to select the claimed formulation from the prior_art_ranges or to modify lumigan 0.03 % to arrive at the claimed formulation
the unexpected_properties of the claimed formulation even if inherent in that formulation differ in kind from the prior_art thereby supporting a conclusion of nonobviousness
see w.l
gore & assocs. inc. v. garlock inc. 721_f.2d_1540 1555 fed.cir.1983` inherency and obviousness are distinct concepts
`` ; in re spormann 53_c.c.p.a._1375 363_f.2d_444 448 1966` that which may be inherent is not necessarily known
obviousness can not be predicated on what is unknown
``

this is not a case where the claims merely recite the unknown properties of an otherwise obvious_formulation
e.g. santarus inc. v. par pharm. inc. 694_f.3d_1344 1354 fed.cir.2012` [ a ] n obvious_formulation can not become nonobvious simply by administering it to a patient and claiming the resulting serum concentrations
`` ; in re kao 639_f.3d_1057 1070 fed.cir.2011` maloneys express teachings render the claimed controlled release oxymorphone formulation obvious and the claimedfood effect adds nothing of patentable consequence`
here the previously unknown and unexpected_properties of a new and nonobvious_formulation constitute additional objective_evidence of nonobviousness

we have considered the remaining arguments on the issue of obviousness but find them unpersuasive
for the foregoing_reasons we affirm the district_courts holding that the asserted claims would not have been obvious in view of the cited references

we next consider the appellants arguments contending that the district_court erred in finding that the group_ii_claims are not invalid for lack of an adequate written description and lupins arguments contending that the court erred in holding that the asserted claims are not invalid for lack of enablement

section 112 of the patent statute provides in relevant_part that the specification shall contain a written description of the invention and of the manner and process of making and using it in such full clear concise and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains or with which it is most nearly connected to make and use the same.. 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?

there is no rigid requirement that the disclosure contain` either examples or an actual reduction to practice' ; the proper inquiry is whether the patentee has provided an adequate description that` in a definite way identifies the claimed invention' in sufficient detail such that a person of ordinary_skill would understand that the inventor had made the invention at the time of filing

id.at 1351

the appellants argue that the claims of the ¡¬353 and ¡¬118_patent s the group_ii_claims which recite clinical_profile_limitations are not adequately supported by the written description because the written description does not disclose any efficacy or hyperemia_data of a formulation comprising 0.01 %_bimatoprost and 200 ppm_bak
the appellants assert that the district_court erred by relying on the permeability_data of test_formulations which are not efficacy or hyperemia_data the constructive_example which relates to a formulation comprising 0.015 %_bimatoprost and 125 ppm_bak and the clinical_protocol which is not part of the specifications
hi-tech additionally argues that there are no` blaze marks' in the specifications to allow the skilled_artisan to immediately discern the clinical_profile claim limitations

allergan responds that the district_court did not clearly err in finding that the appellants failed to prove lack of an adequate written description by clear and convincing_evidence
allergan argues that the written description here adequately describes the claimed invention because it identifies the exact_formulation of lumigan 0.01 % as a best_mode of the invention and lumigan 0.01 % exhibited the claimed clinical results
allergan also responds that the district_court referenced the clinical_protocol simply to corroborate what the specifications show
allergan also maintains that the disclosed permeability_data and the constructive_example are relevant to the written description_inquiry as they would allow the skilled_artisan to predict the clinical performance of lumigan 0.01 %

we agree with allergan that the specifications of the asserted patents provide an adequate written description of the invention claimed by the group_ii_claims
the specifications specifically describe a formulation comprising 0.01 %_bimatoprost and 200 ppm_bak as one of the best_modes of the invention
'504_patent col. 2_ll._59 64-67
the group_ii_claims all require the same amounts of bimatoprost and bak
the specifications thus disclose the claimed formulation as characterized by *1309 those ingredients and the skilled_artisan would immediately discern the claimed formulation in that disclosure

it is true that the group_ii_claims also recite clinical_profile_limitations and the specifications do not explicitly describe the clinical efficacy and hyperemia_profile of the claimed formulation
but the appellants have emphasized in connection with their obviousness challenge that the inherent_properties of a formulation comprising 0.01 %_bimatoprost and 200 ppm_bak produce the claimed clinical_profile

a claim that recites a property that is necessarily inherent in a formulation that is adequately described is not invalid as lacking written description merely because the property itself is not explicitly described
on this particular record we agree with the district_court that the appellants have failed to prove invalidity for lack of an adequate written description by clear and convincing_evidence
see enzo_biochem 323 f.3d at 963` compliance with the written description_requirement is essentially a fact-based inquiry that will necessarily vary depending on the nature of the invention claimed'

lockwood v. am

the clinical_protocol is not part of the specifications of the asserted patents
it should not form the basis of the written description_inquiry even if it shows that the inventors had invented the claimed invention before the time of filing
the written description_requirement requires possession as shown in the specification not as shown by prior experimental work
nevertheless as indicated because the specifications contain an adequate disclosure of the claimed formulation the district_courts erroneous reliance on the clinical_protocol does not affect the outcome of this case

we have considered the remaining arguments on the issue of written description but find them unpersuasive
we therefore conclude that the district_court did not err in finding that the appellants failed to prove by clear and convincing_evidence that the group_ii_claims are invalid for lack of an adequate written description

we review the factual issues underlying enablement for clear_error

lupin argues that the asserted claims are invalid for lack of enablement because the specifications contain no actual efficacy and hyperemia_data ; rather they merely *1310 provide a research proposal
according to lupin the skilled_artisan would not accept without doubt the asserted utility of the claimed formulation i.e. comparable efficacy as lumigan 0.03 % and less_hyperemia
lupin argues that if the claims are held to be nonobvious then they must fail the enablement_requirement because the district_court found that ophthalmic_formulation is unpredictable and that the prior_art taught away from the claimed invention

allergan responds that there is no inconsistency in the district_courts decision that the asserted claims would not have been obvious and that they are also enabled
allergan argues that the specifications disclose the exact_formulation of lumigan 0.01 % and the permeability_data of test_formulations which would enable the skilled_artisan to make and use the claimed invention
allergan also responds that in view of the patents disclosure the skilled_artisan would not have questioned the utility of the claimed formulation

we agree with allergan that the asserted claims are not invalid for lack of enablement
`` [ a ] patent does not need to guarantee that the invention works for a claim to be enabled'
alcon 745 f.3d at 1189
and efficacy data are generally not required in a patent application
only a sufficient description enabling a person of ordinary_skill in the art to carry out an invention is needed
`` similarly a patentee is not required to provide actual working examples ; we have rejected enablement challenges based on the theory that there can be no guarantee that prophetic examples actually work'

col. 6_ll._7 -14
in view of those disclosures we agree with the district_court that the skilled_artisan would not have questioned the utility of the claimed formulation and would be able to make and use the claimed invention without undue_experimentation

lupin argues that` if the asserted claims are non-obvious they can not possibly be enabled'
lupins opening_br
28
we disagree
the obviousness inquiry turns on what the prior_art would have taught a person of ordinary_skill in the art and whether the claimed invention would have been obvious in view of the prior_art
as indicated the claims here would not have been obvious because among other reasons the prior_art taught that bak would not increase the permeability of bimatoprost
in contrast the enablement inquiry turns on whether the skilled_artisan after reading the specification would be able to make and use the claimed invention without undue_experimentation based on the ordinary_skill in the art
because the specifications here provide sufficient guidance to the skilled_artisan there is no tension in the district_courts decision that the asserted claims would not have been obvious and also are not invalid for lack of enablement

we have considered the remaining arguments on the issue of enablement but find *1311 them unpersuasive
we therefore affirm the district_courts holding that lupin failed to prove by clear and convincing_evidence that the asserted claims are invalid for lack of enablement

finally we address hi-techs arguments contending that the district_court erred in finding that its anda_product infringed both literally and under the doctrine of equivalents the group_i claims which require the claimed composition to have a` ph of about 7.3'
a determination of infringement whether literal or under the doctrine of equivalents is a question of fact and is reviewed for clear_error following a bench_trial
biovail corp. int l v. andrx pharm. inc. 239_f.3d_1297 1300 fed.cir.2001
`` prosecution history estoppel operates as a legal limitation on a patentees ability to invoke the doctrine of equivalents and we review its application de novo'
trading techs int l inc. v. open e cry llc 728_f.3d_1309 1318 fed.cir.2013

hi-tech argues that the district_court erred in construing a` ph of about 7.3'
hi-tech also argues that the district_court erred in finding that hi-tech literally infringed the group_i claims and that prosecution history estoppel did not bar allergan from relying on the doctrine of equivalents to prove infringement
allergan responds that hi-tech stipulated to the claim construction in the district_court and can not now allege error for the first time on appeal
allergan also responds that the district_court did not clearly err in finding both literal_infringement and infringement under the doctrine of equivalents

we agree with allergan that the district_court did not clearly err in finding that hi-tech literally infringed the group_i claims
in the district_court the parties agreed to construe a` ph of about 7.3' as a` ph of approximately 7.3' and the district_court adopted that construction
hi-tech did not argue for further construction in the district_court
that construction thus controls in this case

it is undisputed that hi-techs anda specifies that its proposed product has a ph of 6.8-7.2 during the products shelf_life
the district_court thus correctly evaluated infringement based on the proposed product
sunovion pharm. inc. v. teva pharm
usa inc. 731_f.3d_1271 1278-80 fed.cir.2013
after considering the expert testimony proffered by both sides the district_court found that hi-techs product would infringe the group_i claims literally
we find no clear err in that determination
moreover if` about 7.3' is to mean anything other than 7.3 it is not clearly erroneous for it to include a value that differs from it by only one decimal place
because we affirm the district_courts finding of literal_infringement we do not need to address whether the district_court erred in finding infringement under the doctrine of equivalents

we have considered hi-techs remaining arguments but find them unpersuasive
for the foregoing_reasons we affirm the district_courts finding that hi-tech infringed the group_i claims

conclusion
accordingly we affirm the district_courts determination that the asserted claims are not invalid for obviousness or for lack of an adequate written description and enablement and that hi-tech infringed the claims of the ¡¬ 504 ¡¬605 and ¡¬479_patent s
