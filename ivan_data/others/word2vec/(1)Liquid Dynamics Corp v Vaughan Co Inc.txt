background
liquid_dynamics brought the action against vaughan for infringement of the ¡¬ 414 patent under 35 u.s.c.¡± 271 et seq
in the united_states_district_court for the northern_district of illinois
vaughan counterclaimed for invalidity and inequitable_conduct
the district_court after construing the claims of the ¡¬414_patent and comparing the claims to the allegedly infringing products granted vaughan summary_judgment of non-infringement and mooted vaughans counterclaims

a
the claimed invention
this case involves the structure of slurry tanks
slurry tanks are used to store and process chemicals and organic waste products e.g. manure that retain value as useful inputs e.g. fertilizer into other processes
large storage_tanks house these waste_compounds in liquid or semisolid form between their production and their subsequent use
the liquid and solid_components of these waste_compounds tend to separate when stored with solid particles either forming a crust on the top of the tank and/or falling to the bottom of the tank
productive use of the stored compound requires remixing both to suspend the heavy solid particles within the liquid and to ensure that the resulting suspension is uniform
one standard approach has been to stir the mix continuously to avoid settling
because continuous mixing can be expensive however tank designers sought ways to store the mixtures in a still tank to allow the settling to occur and to remix only when necessary for use
the ¡¬ 414 patent addressed these concerns

the ¡¬414_patent has a total of 11 claims
claims 1_and_8 are independent ; the remaining nine claims are dependent
the invention is a method and apparatus for handling wastewater slurries a storage_tank equipped with submerged agitators capable of generating a flow of liquid throughout the tank
the disagreement between the parties turns on the interpretation of four phrases contained in claim 1 and identical phrases in independent claim 8
claim 1 claims apparatus for storing a slurry having solid and liquid_components comprising a storage_tank defining a volume for holding a body of liquid and solid_slurry_components including a floor of generally circular_configuration and having a center said storage_tank further including an outer surrounding wall positioned generally at a radial_distance from the center ; at least two flow_generating_means positioned to be submerged within the liquid and solid_slurry_components for generating flow of at least one of the slurry_components along a rotational direction each of said flow_generating_means being disposed at distances from the center ranging between approximately 30 percent and 70 percent of said radial_distance ; *1364 each of said first and second_flow_generating devices pointed in the direction for generating flows of the liquid and solid_components from the respective flow_generating_means directed in the same rotational sense [ 1 ] said first and second_flow_generating means being directed at an angle to the radius to generate flows with tangential components of flow to impart a rotational movement of the entire_body of liquid and solid_components ; each of said first and second_flow_generating means being pointed toward the outer surrounding wall for generating
[ 2 ] a substantial_helical_flow_path of the liquid and solid_components therein
[ 3 ] with the liquid and solid_components traveling outwardly across the tank_floor from the center_portion of the tank toward the tank_wall and then upwardly along the tank outer surrounding wall to a first_point and then inwardly along an upper_portion of the body toward the center of the tank and then downwardly toward the tank_floor and then outwardly to a second_point spaced circumferentially in the direction of rotation of the entire_body of liquid the liquid and solid_components continuing to travel in the helical_path as the entire_body of liquid and solid_components continues to rotate ; a pressure source coupled to the first and second_flow_generating means to generate directed streams from the flow_generating_means to rotate the body of liquid and solid_components and to cause the flow in the helical_path ; and
[ 4 ] said flow_generating_means creating a substantially volume filling flow of at least one of the slurry_components within said storage_tank which mixes the liquid and solid_slurry_components to form a substantially homogeneous_slurry suitable for unloading from said storage_tank using liquid handling devices

b
the prosecution history
original claim 1 filed with the application that matured into the ¡¬414_patent with the united states patent and trademark office` pto' contained phrase 4 but did not contain phrases 1 2 or 3
specifically original_claim 1 read apparatus for storing a slurry having solid and liquid_components comprising a storage_tank defining a volume for holding the liquid and solid_slurry_components including a floor of generally circular_configuration and having a center_portion said storage_tank further including an outer surrounding wall positioned generally at a preselected radial_distance from the center_portion ; and.at least two flow_generating_means positioned to be submerged within the liquid and solid_slurry_components for generating flow of at least one of the slurry_components along a preselected direction said flow_generating_means being disposed only at distances from the center ranging between approximately 30 percent and 70 percent of said preselected radial_distance ; [ 4 ] said flow_generating_means creating a substantially volume filling flow of at least one of the slurry_components within said storage_tank which mixes the liquid and solid_slurry_components to form a substantially homogeneous_slurry suitable for unloading from said storage_tank using liquid handling devices.2

*1365 the patent examiner rejected the original_claim 1 as obvious in light of the prior_art
the examiner also indicated that the original_claim 1 was` generic' and required the applicant to` elect a single disclosed species for prosecution' under 35 u.s.c.¡± 121
amended claim 1 added phrases 1 2 and 3 and introduced other minor changes not at issue here

amended claim 1 introduced new limitations on the claimed flow
whereas original_claim 1 referred only to a` flow' amended claim 1 required` a substantial_helical_flow_path' phrase 2 traveling` outwardly across the tank_floor from the center_portion of the tank toward the tank_wall and then upwardly along the tank outer surrounding wall to a first_point and then inwardly along an upper_portion of the body toward the center of the tank and then downwardly toward the tank_floor and then outwardly to a second_point spaced circumferentially in the direction of rotation of the entire_body of liquid' phrase 3
the pto accepted claim 1 as amended and issued the patent
amended claim 1 issued as claim 1 of the ¡¬414_patent

c. pre-filing conduct
the ¡¬414_patent was assigned to liquid_dynamics predecessor great_lakes aqua sales and service inc.` great_lakes'
to support its counterclaims of invalidity and inequitable_conduct vaughan alleged that great_lakes made used and sold three mixing systems having the characteristics originally claimed in the ¡¬414_patent more than a year before filing the original application-and submitted documentary evidence to support these allegations

d. the district court decision
liquid_dynamics claimed that 47 of vaughans customized slurry tank systems infringe the ¡¬414_patent
vaughan denied the allegations and counterclaimed for invalidity inequitable_conduct and attorneys fees
vaughan subsequently moved for summary_judgment on grounds of non-infringement invalidity and inequitable_conduct
the district_court disposed of all issues in a single ruling
see generally liquid_dynamics

on the matter of claim_construction the trial judge noted that` phrases 1_and_4 are unambiguous and claim_construction is unnecessary' liquid_dynamics at *20 2002_wl_1769979 but that phrases 2_and_3 required` [ p ] roper claim interpretation [ by ] examination of the claim_language the patent_specification and the prosecution_history'
id.at *10 2002_wl_1769979

both parties suggested interpretations that treated phrases 2_and_3 as a single limitation
vaughan suggested that phrases 2_and_3 require a helical_flow_path consist [ ing ] of the bottom_segment of the path extending essentially radially from the center of the tank to the peripheral wall with the bottom_segment being immediately adjacent to the floor of the tank ; an outer segment extending essentially vertically upward along the outer_wall ; an upper segment extending essentially radially along the upper_portion of the body of slurry in the tank from the outer_wall to the center of the tank ; and an inner segment extending essentially vertically downward at the center ; all segments no more than a negligible radial_distance from the center
id

liquid_dynamics on the other hand advanced a broader definition of substantial_helical_flow a largely or generally spiral-like flow path ; a perfect helical_path is not required ; components of the slurry follow a path generally looping away from the center_portion of the tank toward the tanks wall upwardly toward the upper_portion of the tank *1366 then toward the center_portion and then downwardly
id

the district_court accepted vaughans proffered claim_construction primarily because` the claims plain_language describes a flow path that emanates from the tank_center and returns to the center after one rotation' id.at *10 2002_wl_1769979 and because two of the patents figures figures 5_and_6 illustrate a perfectly helical_flow
id.at *12-*14 2002_wl_1769979
the district_court further noted that the narrowing amendments introduced to claim 1 during prosecution to limit what had been a generalized flow_pattern to the substantially helical one following the specific directional outlines of phrase 3 not only supported vaughans interpretation of the claim_language id.at *15 2002_wl_1769979 but also narrowed the range of infringing equivalents that liquid_dynamics could assert
id.at *28 2002_wl_1769979 citing warner-jenkinson co. v. hilton davis chem co. 520_u.s._17 29-30 117_s.ct._1040 137_l.ed.2d_146_(1997) ; athletic alternatives inc. v. prince mfg. inc. 73_f.3d_1573_(fed.cir.1996)

having thus construed the claims the district_court compared the claims to vaughans allegedly infringing products following markman v. westview instruments inc. 52_f.3d_967 976 fed.cir.1995 en banc affd 517_u.s._370 116_s.ct._1384 134_l.ed.2d_577_(1996)
liquid_dynamics submitted evidence of infringement primarily through the testimony of its expert dr. richard lueptow
dr._lueptow had simulated a series of computational flow dynamics to illustrate both the path of a single particle the` particle_plots' and the velocity of that particle the` vector_plots' in each of vaughans tanks
liquid_dynamics at *23 2002_wl_1769979
the district_court noted that all of dr._lueptows exhibits as well as his testimony had been based on liquid_dynamics construction of the claim which the court had rejected
the district_court ruled that no reasonable person considering the particle_plots could conclude that vaughans tanks infringed the ¡¬414_patent given the district_courts construction of the claim

the district_court did not comment on dr._lueptows submitted vector_plots
dr._lueptow had explained that in velocity vector_plots the many vectors in a specified plane or slice of the flow indicate the direction of flow orientation of the vector and the magnitude of the velocity in the plane of the slice length of the vector
the vector_plots in vertical planes through the axis of the tank that i analyzed showed circulation of the fluid outward in the lower portion of the tank upward in the outer portion inward in the top portion of the tank and downward near the center_portion of the tank for each of the categories of vaughan tanks
decl
of dr. richard m. lueptow ? ?
27-28
the court did not discuss the relationship between the flow_pattern that dr._lueptow attributed to his vector_plots and the flow_pattern required under the courts claim_construction

the district_court granted summary_judgment in favor of vaughan and mooted vaughans counterclaims for invalidity and inequitable_conduct
both parties timely appealed

a determination of patent_infringement requires a two-step analysis
the court must first interpret the claim and determine the scope and the meaning of the asserted patent claims and then compare the properly construed claims to the allegedly infringing device

b
claim construction
courts construe claims by considering the evidence necessary to resolve disputes about claim_terms and to assign a fixed unambiguous legally operative_meaning to the claim
vitronics corp. v. conceptronic inc. 90_f.3d_1576 1582 fed.cir.1996
it is well-settled that in interpreting an asserted claim the court should look first to the intrinsic evidence of record i.e. the patent itself including the claims the specification and if in evidence the prosecution_history
such intrinsic evidence is the most significant source of the legally operative_meaning of disputed claim_language
id

we examine this intrinsic evidence seriatim
`` we look first to the claim_language itself to define the scope of the patented invention
as a starting point we give claim_terms their ordinary and accustomed meaning as understood by one of ordinary_skill in the art'
dow chem co. v. sumitomo chem co. 257_f.3d_1364 1372 fed.cir.2001
we look to the written description for guidance` when the claim_language itself lacks sufficient clarity to ascertain the scope of the claims'
deering 347 f.3d at 1322
we also look at the written description` to determine whether the inventor has used any terms in a manner inconsistent with their ordinary_meaning
the specification acts as a dictionary when it expressly defines terms used in the claims or when it defines terms by implication'
vitronics 90 f.3d at 1582
`` the specification contains a written description of the invention which must be clear and complete enough to enable those of ordinary_skill in the art to make and use it
thus the specification is always highly relevant to the claim_construction analysis'
id

we look next to the prosecution_history
when we use the prosecution_history as source material the prior_art cited and the applicants acquiescence with regard to that prior_art indicate the scope of the claims or in other_words what the *1368 claims do not cover
autogiro co. of am
v. united states 181_ct.cl._55 65 384_f.2d_391_(1967)
furthermore` where the patentee has unequivocally disavowed a certain meaning to obtain his patent the doctrine of prosecution disclaimer attaches and narrows the ordinary_meaning of the claim congruent with the scope of the surrender'
omega eng g inc. v. raytek corp. 334_f.3d_1314 1324 fed.cir.2003

the district_court identified the four disputed phrases in claim 1 and determined that the claim_language of phrases 1_and_4 was clear and needed no interpretation
the district_court however was unable to interpret the helical_flow_pattern described in phrases 2_and_3 by reference to the claim_language alone and considered the written description the figures of the patent and the prosecution_history
the district_court noted that two of the patents figures figures 5_and_6 illustrate a perfect helical_flow
in the prosecution_history the district_court noted that claim 1 as originally filed did not include language related to a helix-or to any other particular flow_pattern-and that the amendments submitted to distinguish the claim from the prior_art first introduced the` substantial helical' limitation
based on these findings the district_court adopted vaughans suggested construction

the district_courts analysis was erroneous because claim 1 was not ambiguous and its plain_meaning was not contradicted by the written description
the plain_language of phrase 2 requires a` substantial_helical_flow'
the term` substantial' is a meaningful modifier implying` approximate' rather than` perfect'
in cordis corp. v. medtronic ave inc. 339_f.3d_1352 1361 fed.cir.2003 the district_court imposed a precise numeric constraint on the term` substantially uniform_thickness'
we noted that the proper interpretation of this term was` of largely or approximately uniform_thickness' unless something in the prosecution_history imposed the` clear and unmistakable disclaimer' needed for narrowing beyond this simple-language interpretation
id
in anchor wall systems v. rockwood retaining walls inc. 340_f.3d_1298 1311 fed.cir.2003 we noted that` nothing in the prosecution_history.. clearly limits the scope ofgenerally parallel such that the adverbgenerally does not broaden the meaning of parallel
accordingly we hold that the phrasegenerally parallel envisions some amount of deviation from exactly parallel' and that` words of approximation such asgenerally andsubstantially are descriptive terms commonly used in patent claimsto avoid a strict numerical boundary to the specified parameter
`` id.at 1311

similarly the plain_language of claim 1 requires neither a perfectly helical_flow nor a flow that returns precisely to the center after one rotation a limitation that arises only as a logical consequence of requiring a perfectly helical_flow
because the plain_language of the claim was clear and uncontradicted by anything in the written description or the figures the district_court should not have relied upon the written description the figures or the prosecution_history to add limitations to the claim
under such circumstances relying on the written description and prosecution_history to reject the ordinary and customary meanings of the words themselves is impermissible
tex
digital sys
v. telegenix inc. 308_f.3d_1193 1204 fed.cir.2002
courts construing claims must also remember that [ w ] hile.. claims are to be interpreted in light of the specification and with a view to ascertaining the invention it does not follow that limitations from the specification may be read into the claims
we recognize that there is sometimes a fine line between reading a *1369 claim in light of the specification and reading a limitation into the claim from the specification
comark communications v. harris corp. 156_f.3d_1182 1187 fed.cir.1998 citations omitted

the district_court relied on the written description of figures 5_and_6 to import the limitation of a perfectly helical_flow
there is no language in the claim requiring such a perfectly helical_flow
we have consistently warned against this approach to claim_construction
see amgen inc. v. hoechst marion roussel inc. 314_f.3d_1313 1325 fed.cir.2003` because the claims are best understood in light of the specification of which they are a part.. courts must take extreme care when ascertaining the proper scope of the claims lest they simultaneously import into the claims limitations that were unintended by the patentee
`` ; ccs fitness inc. v. brunswick corp. 288_f.3d_1359 1366 fed.cir.2002 explaining that the presumption of ordinary_meaning can not be rebutted` simply by pointing to the preferred embodiment or other structures or steps disclosed in the specification or prosecution_history'
claim 1 properly construed does not require a perfectly helical_flow

the district_court here failed to differentiate between` helical' and` substantial helical'
claim 1 as properly construed claims all flow_patterns that are generally though not necessarily perfectly spiral and that fill much though not necessarily all of the tanks volume
this construction of the claim follows from the words` substantial_helical_flow' in phrase 2 the directional outline of phrase 3 and the words` substantially volume filling' in phrase 4

c. infringement
the second_step of an infringement analysis is the courts comparison of the allegedly infringing device with the claim
bai 160 f.3d at 1353
this analysis requires a determination that every claim_limitation or its equivalent is found in the accused device
deering 347 f.3d at 1324
because the district_court resolved a material_factual_dispute by comparing the accused product to an improperly construed claim we reverse the summary_judgment
pickholtz 284 f.3d at 1374

the district_court disposed of liquid_dynamics literal infringement analysis by dismissing dr._lueptows particle flow analyses as premised upon an improper claim_construction
at oral argument however both parties agreed that dr._lueptows vector_plots illustrate paths that are nearer to helical than those shown in the particle_plots though liquid_dynamics asserted that both sets of diagrams provide useful evidence of infringement while vaughan asserted that neither set is reliable

liquid_dynamics has thus submitted evidence that might convince a reasonable_jury that vaughans systems generate flows that are generally though not necessarily perfectly spiral and that fill much though not necessarily all of the tanks volume
in other_words liquid_dynamics might be able to convince a reasonable_jury that at least some of vaughans 47 systems literally infringe the ¡¬414_patent as correctly construed

the narrowing amendments introduced during prosecution to overcome the applications obviousness in light of the prior_art however may prevent liquid_dynamics from using the doctrine of equivalents to claim any flows that are not substantially helical
festo corp. v. shoketsu kinzoku kogyo kabushiki co. 344_f.3d_1359_(fed.cir.2003)` [ a ] narrowing amendment made to comply with any provision of the patent act.. may invoke an estoppel`
as the district_court recognized *1370 the ¡¬414_patents helical_flow_path is central to the operation of the invention not an insubstantial part of its overall structure..
the patent prosecution_history establishes that the scope of the ¡¬414_patent was narrowed to encompass a specific type of flow_pattern
the ¡¬414_patents plain_language provides for a specific_flow_pattern that is central to the invention
liquid_dynamics at *27-*28 2002_wl_1769979
that` specific_flow_pattern' refers to the` substantial_helical_flow' of claim 1
the district_courts characterization of the prosecution_history creates a presumption that liquid_dynamics surrendered its rights to all flows that are not substantially helical even if they perform the same function as a substantially helical_flow
festo 344 f.3d at 1366
liquid_dynamics may establish literal infringement of the ¡¬414_patent by showing a substantially helical_flow but it will have to overcome the presumption of surrender to claim that any flow other than a substantially helical one infringes under the doctrine of equivalents
see festo at 1369-70

d. mootness
the district_court mooted vaughans counterclaims of invalidity and unenforceability citing spectronics corp. v. h.b
fuller co. inc. 940_f.2d_631 637-38 fed.cir.1991
because we reversed the summary_judgment of non-infringement these counterclaims are no longer moot and must be reinstated

we decided spectronics however under a strict per se policy of mooting claims of invalidity following rulings of non-infringement
the supreme_court rejected that policy in cardinal_chemical co. v. morton international 508_u.s._83 95 113_s.ct._1967 124_l.ed.2d_1_(1993) explaining that in the trial court of course a party seeking a declaratory_judgment has the burden of establishing the existence of an actual case or controversy..
in patent litigation a party may satisfy that burden and seek a declaratory_judgment even if the patentee has not filed an infringement action
judge markey has described` the sad and saddening scenario that led to enactment of the declaratory_judgment_act act 28 u.s.c.¡± 2201
in the patent version of that scenario a patent_owner engages in a danse macabre brandishing a damoclean threat with a sheathed sword.. before the act competitors victimized by that tactic were rendered helpless and immobile so long as the patent_owner refused to grasp the nettle and sue
after the act those competitors were no longer restricted to an in terrorem choice between the incurrence of a growing potential liability for patent_infringement and abandonment of their enterprises ; they could clear the air by suing for a judgment that would settle the conflict of interests
the sole requirement for jurisdiction under the act is that the conflict be real and immediate i.e. that there be a true actualcontroversy required by the act'
...
merely the desire to avoid the threat of a` scarecrow' patent in learned hands phrase may therefore be sufficient to establish jurisdiction under the declaratory_judgment_act
if in addition to that desire a party has actually been charged with infringement of the patent there is necessarily a case or controversy adequate to support jurisdiction of a complaint or a counterclaim under the act
id.at 95-96 113_s.ct._1967 citations and footnotes omitted

we have noted that` [ t ] he supreme_courts decision in cardinal_chemical does not preclude this discretionary action by the district_court
cardinal_chemical simply prohibits us as an intermediate *1371 appellate court from vacating a judgment of invalidity when we conclude that a patent has not been infringed and therefore has no bearing on the district_courts actions in this case'
phonometrics 133 f.3d at 1468
a district_court judge faced with an invalidity counterclaim challenging a patent that it concludes was not infringed may either hear the claim or dismiss it without prejudice subject to review only for abuse of discretion
nystrom v. trex co. 339_f.3d_1347 1351 fed.cir.2003

conclusion
because the district_court erred in construing` substantial_helical_flow_path' and in requiring a flow that emanates from the tank_center and returns to the center after one rotation and because there is a material_factual_dispute we vacate the district_courts grant of summary_judgment of non-infringement and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion

vacated and remanded

each party shall bear its own costs

lourie circuit_judge dissenting
i respectfully dissent from the majoritys conclusion
i would affirm the district_courts claim_construction
it is fully supported by both the language of the claim and the specification
the claim requires the liquid and solid_components to` travel [ ] outwardly across the tank_floor from the center_portion of the tank toward the tank_wall and then upwardly along the tank outer surrounding wall to a first_point and then inwardly along an upper_portion of the body toward the center of the tank'
clearly the flow returns to the center
moreover i disagree with the majoritys conclusion that` [ c ] laim 1 requires neither a perfectly helical_flow nor a flow that returns precisely to the center after one rotation'
clearly the meaning of the claim is that the tank components return to the center after one rotation of helical_flow
while the word` one' is not used that is the plain_meaning of the claim
the flow returns to the center after one rotation
although the district_courts language may have been a bit different from that used by the majority it is not sufficiently different in my view to justify reversal
the district_court expressly stated that` a perfect helix is not required'
in addition the district_court did not err in interpreting the claim in light of the patent_specification including figures 5_and_6
