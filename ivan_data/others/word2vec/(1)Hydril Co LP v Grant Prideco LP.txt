a
industry background
according to the second amended complaint the appellants hydril company l.p. and hydril_u.k._ltd. collectively` hydril' manufacture threaded connections for interlocking lengths of drill_pipe used in drilling oil and gas wells
pls
2nd am
compl
? ?
8-14
hydril does not itself make drill_pipe but outside the united_states it sometimes sells finished_drill_pipe that uses its connections and pipe manufactured by someone else
id
?
15
the appellee grant_prideco inc.` grant_prideco' manufactures *1346 and sells both drill_pipe and its own line of connections
id
?
16

hydril generally sells its connections to drill_pipe distributors` who are assembling finished_drill_pipe for an end-user' id
?
14 which` typically' is a drilling contractor or a major oil company
id
?
10
`` finished drill_pipe is usually specially manufactured to meet an order from the end-user'
id
this case involves drill_pipe whose diameter is 5 ? -inches-a product that hydril alleges has` unique characteristics' for certain types of drilling
id
? ?
18-28

b
the antitrust claim
this claim involves grant_pridecos united_states patent no._6244,631` the ¡¬631_patent` which covers a combination of raw_pipe with specified diameters and connections that fit such pipe
id
? ?
31-33

paragraph 57 of the complaint encapsulates the antitrust_claim as follows under the theory of walker_process equipment inc. v. food_machinery & chemical corp. 382_u.s._172 86_s.ct._347 15_l.ed.2d_247_(1965) grant_prideco has violated section 2 of the sherman_act by obtaining and maintaining market_power in the relevant_markets by use of threats to enforce a patent that grant_prideco knew was procured by fraud

the alleged fraud was that` [ d ] uring the application process for the ¡¬631_patent grant_prideco failed to disclose to the uspto_material_prior_art of which grant_prideco was aware'
id
?
35
the complaint referred to various items of prior_art that grant_prideco failed to disclose id
? ?
38-40 and stated the ¡¬631_patent as issued would not have been granted to grant_prideco had grant_prideco not omitted from its disclosures such known information on the prior_art including its own prior sales of covered technology
id
?
43

the complaint further stated that` grant_pridecos concealment of prior_art from the uspto continued even after the ¡¬631_patent issued' and that grant_pridecos` filing for reissue with disclosure of only selective prior_art was also an attempt to practice fraud on the uspto'
id
?
44

the complaint described the` relevant [ product ] markets' as` 1 the market for connections used with 5 ? -inch outer diameter pipe ; and 2 the market for finished 5 ? -inch drill_pipe'
id
?
45
it stated that the` relevant [ geographic ] markets' for both products were` worldwide'
id
?
46

the complaint alleged that
grant_prideco has obtained and maintained its market_power in the relevant_markets by wrongfully threatening to enforce the ¡¬631_patent against other market participants including connections manufacturers drill_pipe distributors and end-users
grant_prideco has obtained a dominant position in the sale of connections of all practically-functional sizes for use with 5 ? -inch drill_pipe making a substantial_portion of all sales of connections for such use
similarly grant_prideco dominates the 5 ? -inch drill_pipe market.. grant_prideco makes a substantial_portion of all sales of finished 5 ? -inch drill_pipe worldwide
id.at ?
47

finally the alleged` use of threats to enforce a [ fraudulently procured ] patent' was that
grant_prideco has widely publicized the existence of the ¡¬631_patent to the industry in general and also has directed communications to particular industry *1347 participants suggesting that grant_prideco would act aggressively to challenge activities that it saw as potentially infringing
for example on january 29 2003 grant_pridecos outside patent counsel wrote a letter to omsco a drill_pipe distributor that holds license rights to manufacture hydrils wedge thread tool joints
the letter asserted that certain orders from omscos customers for 5 7/8-inch pipe with 7-inch tool joints may violate the ¡¬631_patent
the orders referenced were presumably from the end-use drilling contractor atwood oceanics which was copied on letter
the letter suggested that omsco take action to` ensure that [ grant_pridecos ] patent_rights are being respected' in connection with omscos sales of drill_pipe
grant_pridecos letter was intended and understood to be a threat to omsco to refrain from sales of 5 7/8-inch drill_pipe
on information and belief grant_prideco also communicated a similar message asserting its patent to others in the pipe and drilling industries including diamond offshore tuboscope and riteco
id
?

c. the breach of contract and patent infringement claims
these claims arise out of the following allegations in the complaint` grant_prideco has breached a technology_licensing_agreement with hydril and violated hydrils patent_rights overwedge thread technology' which is` a technology developed by hydril for making high-torque connections between neighboring pieces of pipe tubing or conduit'
id
? ?
63-64
hydrils united_states patent reissue no._34467` the ¡¬467_patent` covers some of that technology
id
?
65

in the late 1980s former hydril employees with extensive knowledge of hydrils wedge_thread_technology left the company and founded xls holding inc. and xl systems inc. collectively` xls'
after xls` began marketing wedge thread connections without a license to use hydrils intellectual_property [ ] hydril sued xls for misappropriation of trade_secrets and know-how and for patent_infringement
that lawsuit settled in 1994 on confidential terms with hydril receiving an equity stake in xls
following and as part of the settlement xls focused its wedge_technology_activities on large-diameter_connections 20 inches and over and hydril focused its wedge_technology_activities on smaller-diameter_connections less than 20 inches'
id
?
66

`` in august 1997 the owners of xls including hydril sold the equity of the company to an affiliate of grant_prideco
(merger_agreement
grant_prideco and its other affiliates had never before offered wedge_thread_technology
accordingly in connection with the transaction hydril grant_prideco and various related entities executed a license sharing agreement known as the wedge_thread_license_agreementwedge_agreement' id
? ?
67-68 which the record shows was an exhibit to the merger_agreement and which both hydril and grant_prideco signed

`` under the wedge_agreement hydril granted grant_prideco the exclusive right to use hydrils existing intellectual_property including the protected know-how and trade_secrets on wedge technology to make large-diameter_connections thus allowing grant_prideco to essentially continue xlss large-diameter_business'

`` in exchange grant_prideco granted hydril the exclusive license to use xlss wedge thread patents trade_secrets and know-how to make smaller-diameter_connections'

`` under the exclusivity provisions of the wedge_agreement grant_prideco is restricted from using the licensed intellectual *1348 property and know-how from its large-diameter_business to develop smaller-diameter_connections
similarly hydril is restricted from using the licensed intellectual_property or know-how from its smaller-diameter_business to develop large-diameter_connections'

`` under [ those provisions ] either party could develop products in the others field so long as it did so completely independently of the intellectual_property and know-how of its existing business'
id
? ?
70-73

`` grant_prideco has materially breached its obligations under the wedge_agreement by improperly disclosing intellectual_property and by improperly using intellectual_property it agreed would be used only for large-diameter_connections as part of grant_pridecos development of smaller-diameter_connections'
id
?
81
the complaint described various actions by grant_prideco that constituted the alleged breaches of the confidentiality provisions of the wedge_agreement
id
? ?
75-80

according to the complaint the foregoing activities by grant_prideco constituted` a material_breach of the wedge_agreement and ended grant_pridecos field-of-use license to hydrils patents trade_secrets and know-how'
id
? ?
84-85
thus hydril alleges as a result of the termination of the wedge_agreement grant_pridecos actions infringed hydrils ¡¬467_patent
id
?
?
87-91

d. the district court decision
in two separate opinions the district_court dismissed the antitrust and patent_claims for failure to state a valid_claim for relief pursuant to rule 12 b 6 of the federal_rules of civil_procedure

in dismissing the antitrust_claim the district_court held that` [ b ] ecause hydril has failed to allege enforcement_activity by grant_prideco which would create an objectively reasonable_apprehension that grant_prideco intended to enforce the ¡¬631_patent against hydril plaintiffs have failed to allege the minimum_level of enforcement necessary to state a walker_process_claim against grant_prideco'
hydril_co. l.p. v. grant_prideco l.p. 385_f.supp.2d_609 612 s.d.tex.2005` hydril_ii`
the court stated that neither plaintiff` alleges enforcement_activity by grant_prideco which would create an objectively reasonable_apprehension that grant_prideco might sue hydril for patent_infringement' ; and that` the january 2003 letter to omsco does not contain an explicit threat or other language which under the totality of the circumstances could create a reasonable_apprehension on hydrils part that grant_prideco might sue it for patent_infringement
there is no allegation that any similar letters sent by grant_prideco or its counsel to others in the pipe and drilling industry were more explicit or otherwise indicated grant_pridecos intention to enforce the ¡¬631_patent against hydril or others'
id.at 611-12

the district_court dismissed the patent_claim on the ground that in a provision of the 1997 merger agreement between hydril and grant_prideco section 12.12 discussed in part iii below the parties waived the right to sue for patent_infringement` relating to this agreement' and provided only a breach of contract remedy for such_claims
hydril_co. l.p. v. grant_prideco l.p. no
civ.a
h-05-0337 2005_wl_1515422 at *3 s.d.tex
june_22,_2005` hydril i`
it concluded that` hydril agreed in ¡± 12.12 a of the merger_agreement to waive its right to enforce its statutory_rights in the ¡¬ 467 patent against grant_prideco'
id.at *4

finally the district_court declined to exercise` supplemental_jurisdiction' over the` state_law breach of contract_claim' which it denied without prejudice to the plaintiffs refiling it in state court
hydril_ii at 612

*1349 ii
a
in walker_process the supreme_court` concluded that the enforcement of a patent procured by fraud on the patent_office may be violative of ¡± 2 of the sherman_act provided the other elements necessary to a ¡± 2 case are present'
382 u.s. at 174 86_s.ct._347
it stated that walker_process` alleged that food_machinery obtained the patent by knowingly and willfully misrepresenting facts to the patent_office
proof of this assertion would be sufficient to strip food_machinery of its exemption from the antitrust_laws' that the patent provided
id.at 177 86_s.ct._347
the court pointed out that` [ t ] o establish monopolization or attempt to monopolize.. under ¡± 2 of the sherman_act it would then be necessary to appraise the exclusionary_power of the illegal patent_claim in terms of the relevant_market for the product involved'
id

this court has` consistently explained that walker_process_fraud is a variant of common_law_fraud'` and that the elements of common_law_fraud include 1 a representation of a material fact 2 the falsity of that representation' and` 3 the intent to deceive or at least a state of mind so reckless as to the consequences that it is held to be the equivalent of intent scienter'
unitherm food sys inc. v. swift-eckrich inc. 375_f.3d_1341 1358 fed.cir.2004 citations omitted revd on other_grounds 546_u.s._394 126_s.ct._980 163_l.ed.2d_974_(2006)

as noted hydrils complaint alleged that grant_prideco had fraudulently obtained its ¡¬631_patent by` fail [ ing ] to disclose to the uspto_material_prior_art of which [ it ] was aware' which the complaint described and that` [ t ] he ¡¬631_patent as issued would not have been granted to grant_prideco had grant_prideco not omitted from its disclosures such known information on the prior_art'
if hydril can prove these allegations they would ground a claim of monopolization in violation of ¡± 2 of the sherman_act because they` would be sufficient to strip [ grant_prideco ] of its exemption from the antitrust_laws' its patent would otherwise provide
walker_process 382 u.s. at 177 86_s.ct._347 footnote omitted

the complaint alleges that grant_prideco obtained its patent by knowingly and deliberately concealing from the patent_office_prior_art that it knew would have resulted in a denial of its application
since neither the patent_application nor the prosecution history is before us we can not tell whether it is contended that in obtaining the patent grant_prideco made affirmative misstatements to the patent_office about the prior_art
cf
walker_process where the complaint` alleged fraud on the basis that food_machinery had sworn before the patent_office that it neither knew nor believed that its invention had been in public use in the united_states for more than one year prior to filing its patent_application when in fact food_machinery was a party to prior use within such time'
382 u.s. at 174 86_s.ct._347
in any event the complaints allegations here go far beyond a simple failure to disclose to the patent_office_prior_art that the examiner would have deemed material

under our precedent the conduct alleged in hydrils complaint would constitute walker_process_fraud
cf
nobelpharma ab v. implant innovations inc. 141_f.3d_1059 1070 fed.cir.1998` we agree that if the evidence shows that the asserted patent was acquired by means of either a fraudulent_misrepresentation or a fraudulent_omission and that the party asserting the patent was aware of the fraud when bringing suit such conduct can expose a patentee to liability under the antitrust_laws
we arrive at this conclusion because a fraudulent_omission can be just *1350 as reprehensible as a fraudulent_misrepresentation
``

b
the district_court dismissed the antitrust_claim because hydril` failed to allege the minimum_level of enforcement necessary to state a walker_process_claim against grant_prideco' since it did not` allege enforcement_activity by grant_prideco which would create an objectively reasonable_apprehension that grant_prideco intended to enforce the ¡¬631_patent against hydril'
hydril_ii at 612
it is unclear whether the defect the court discerned in hydrils complaint was a failure to allege sufficient enforcement_activity by grant_prideco i.e. such as would create a` reasonable expectation' that grant_prideco would file patent_infringement litigation or a failure to threaten such activity against hydril itself rather than against hydrils customers
neither ground however justifies dismissal of the complaint at what the district_court described as the` very early stages' of the case
id

in relying on the enforcement ground the district_court noted our statement in unitherm that` as a matter of federal circuit antitrust law the standards that we have developed for determining jurisdiction in a declaratory_judgment_action of patent invalidity also define the minimum_level ofenforcement necessary to expose the patentee to a walker_process_claim for attempted monopolization'
id
( citing unitherm 375 f.3d at 1358
to the extent the district_courts ruling may have been based on hydrils failure to allege threatened enforcement action against hydril rather than against its customers a valid walker_process_claim may be based upon enforcement_activity directed against the plaintiffs customers
threats of patent_litigation against customers based on a fraudulently-procured patent with a reasonable likelihood that such threats will cause the customers to cease dealing with their supplier is the kind of economic coercion that the antitrust_laws are intended to prevent
a supplier may be equally injured if it loses its share of the market because its customers stop dealing with it than if its competitor directs its monopolistic endeavors against the supplier itself
without customers a supplier has no business

our recent_decision in microchip technology inc. v. the chamberlain group 441_f.3d_936_(fed.cir.2006) does not require a different conclusion
there we held that a district_court did not have jurisdiction under the declaratory_judgment_act to entertain a suit raising various patent issues because the threats of enforcement litigation directed against the patentees customers failed to satisfy the first part of our test for declaratory_judgment jurisdiction-that` the declaratory plaintiff must establish.. a reasonable_apprehension that it will face a patent_infringement_suit if it commences or continues the activity at issue'
id.at 942
for the reasons previously given we decline to extend that ruling to invalidate a walker_process_claim alleging threats of infringement litigation directed against a suppliers customers by the holder of a patent allegedly procured by fraud on the patent_office
( this case does not present an occasion to address the supreme_courts recent_decision in medimmune inc. v. genentech inc. 549_u.s._118 127_s.ct._764 166_l.ed.2d_604_(2007) which dealt with the standard for determining when a declaratory_judgment action satisfies the case-or-controversy requirement of the declaratory_judgment_act

c. grant_prideco contends that the district_courts dismissal of the antitrust_claim may be upheld on various other_grounds on which the district_court did not rely
it contends that under fifth_circuit_antitrust_law which we apply in deciding non-patent antitrust questions *1351 unitherm 375 f.3d at 1355 hydrils antitrust_claim fails for the following three additional reasons

1
hydril has not shown injury in fact because it alleges only exclusion from the international market but not from the domestic market ; does not allege that it made or sold an infringing product ; and does not allege improper conduct` during the effective [ time ] period of the [ ¡¬631 ] patent'

2
hydril and hydril u.k. are` remote parties' who can not maintain the walker_process_claim

3
hydril has not alleged that the ¡¬631_patent gave grant_prideco any market_power in the relevant_market

although we may affirm a district_court judgment on any ground shown by the record even though that was not the basis of the district_courts decision lion raisins inc. v. united_states 416_f.3d_1356 1368 fed.cir.2005 that authority is discretionary not mandatory
see q int l courier inc. v. smoak 441_f.3d_214 220_n._3_(4th_cir.2006)` the defendants also argue several alternative grounds for affirmance
although we are not precluded from addressing these arguments we deem it more appropriate to allow the district_court to consider them if necessary in the first_instance on remand`
in the present case we decline to consider these additional grounds for affirmance because we conclude that they would be more appropriately addressed in the first_instance by the district_court

the alternative grounds for affirmance appear to involve complex and difficult questions of fifth_circuit_antitrust_law which the parties sharply dispute and the answers to which may be far from clear
the answers may require careful study of an already substantial record or even augmentation of that record
the district_court appears to be in the best position initially to resolve these issues and such resolution seems to be the best course to follow here

iii
the ability of hydril to pursue its patent_infringement_claim turns primarily upon the meaning and application of ¡± 12.12 a of the merger_agreement which provides except for the rights and remedies expressly provided under this agreement each party waives any and all rights and remedies relating to this agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby sounding in tort fraud misrepresentation statute warranty constructive or resulting trust equitable_rescission quantum_meruit implied contract or injury outside this agreement
the sole_basis for any right or remedy by any party against any other_party and their respective representatives relating to this agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby is a breach of contract or specific_performance action for breach of this agreement or the other documents referenced herein
another provision of the merger_agreement ¡± 2.14 captioned` intellectual_property' includes the following statement the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this agreement will not result in the loss of any intellectual_property including any loss under the wedge_thread_license_agreement..
section 11.45 of the merger_agreement defines` intellectual_property' to` mean patents patent_rights..'

the theory of hydrils patent_infringement_claim is as follows even if the wedge_agreement authorized grant_prideco to use hydrils patented_technology to make large diameter_connections grant_prideco breached that agreement by using *1352 or permitting others to use that technology to make small diameter_connections
the effect of grant_pridecos breach was to terminate its license to use hydrils patented_technology
grant_prideco therefore is subject to suit for patent_infringement because after the wedge_agreement had terminated grant_prideco could no longer rely on the prior license it had to use hydrils patented_technology

the district_court rejected the argument on the ground that ¡± 12.12 precluded any patent_infringement_suit for any claims` relating to the agreement' and limited the parties remedy for such_claims to actions for breach of contract
the court rejected hydrils contention that in ¡± 12.12 the parties did not waive` remedies for post-contractual conduct'
hydril i at *3
the court stated that the contractual language
explicitly waives` any and all rights and remedies relating to [ the merger_agreement ] and the transactions contemplated' thereby including the licenses created by the wedge_agreement
it specifically waives rights created by statute which include patent_rights
the waiver in ¡± 12.12 a includes any` injury outside' the merger_agreement so long as the injury relates to the merger_agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.. hydrils patent_infringement_claim seeks to enforce statutory_rights related to the merger_agreement and the licenses contemplated by and created under the merger_agreement
as a result hydril agreed in ¡± 12.12 a of the merger_agreement to waive its right to enforce its statutory_rights in the ¡¬467_patent against grant_prideco and the motion to dismiss the patent_infringement_claim must be dismissed [ sic ;` dismissed' should be` granted' ]
id.at *3-*4

it is doubtful whether ¡± 12.12 a even covers patent_infringement_claims
that sections proscription of other remedies in favor of breach-of-contract_claims lists 11 specific types of conduct it covers` tort fraud misrepresentation statute warranty constructive or resulting trust equitable_rescission quantum_meruit implied contract or injury outside this agreement'
these appear to be the types of claims that traditionally arise out of the performance of a contract or its breach
a claim for patent_infringement however stems from and is based upon the patent laws not particular contractual provisions

in view of the length and detail relating to all aspects of the merger set forth in the merger_agreement the text of which occupies 47 pages of the joint appendix one would think that if the parties intended to preclude patent_infringement_suits they would explicitly have so provided
the single reference to` statute' in ¡± 12.12 as one of the 11 categories of covered claims is a weak foundation upon which to ground an exclusion of patent_litigation
moreover such exclusion of patent_litigation which often is essential to protecting patent_rights seems inconsistent with the statement in ¡± 2.14 of the merger_agreement quoted above that` [ t ] he consummation of the transactions contemplated by this agreement will not result in the loss of any intellectual_property'
although in other contexts patent_infringement sometimes has been referred to as a tort see e.g. a.c. aukerman co. v. r.l
chaides construction co. 960_f.2d_1020 1031 fed.cir.1992 the term` tort' in ¡± 12.12 a can not properly be read to cover a claim for patent_infringement

*1353 we need not decide however whether ¡± 12.12 initially barred hydril from suing for patent_infringement because whether or not it did we do not read it as imposing such preclusion after the wedge_agreement and the licenses had terminated
section 12.12 governs` rights and remedies relating to the agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby' and provides that the` sole_basis for any right or remedy by any party against any other_party relating to this agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby is a breach of contract.. action..'

once the wedge_agreement license has been terminated as the complaint alleges occurred however a claim for patent_infringement that occurred after the termination is not one` relating to this [ merger ] agreement and the transactions contemplated therein'
the claim is one that arises solely under the patent statute
grant_pridecos prior authorization under the terminated license in the wedge_agreement to use hydrils patented_technology is irrelevant to that claim

iv
after dismissing the antitrust and patent_infringement_claims the district_court dismissed the remaining state breach-of-contract_claim which included a request for a declaratory_judgment that the wedge_agreement had been terminated pls
2nd am
compl
? ?
83-85 because it declined to exercise supplemental_jurisdiction over that claim
in light of our reversal of the dismissal of the federal claims presumably the district_court will want to reinstate the state_law_claim
in any event the court should have the opportunity to do so
we therefore vacate the dismissal of the state_law_claims

to avoid any possible misunderstanding of our narrow decision we point out perhaps unnecessarily that in reversing and remanding we neither express nor intimate any view on the remaining issues in this case
we hold only that in response to a motion to dismiss under rule 12 b 6 the district_court should not have dismissed the sherman_act and patent_infringement_claims

conclusion
the judgment of the district_court is reversed insofar as it dismissed the antitrust and patent_claims and vacated insofar as it dismissed the state-law claims
the case is remanded to that court for further_proceedings consistent with this opinion

reversed in part vacated in part and remanded
mayer circuit_judge dissenting
because hydril did not have standing to bring either an antitrust_claim with respect to the finished_drill_pipe_market or a claim for infringement of u.s. reissue patent no._34467 i respectfully dissent from the majoritys decision to reverse the district_court on those two issues

a patent exempts its holder from the general prohibition against monopolies
walker_process equip. inc. v. food mach
& chem co. 382_u.s._172 177 86_s.ct._347 15_l.ed.2d_247_(1965) citing precision instrument mfg co. v. auto
maint
mach co. 324_u.s._806 816 65_s.ct._993 89_l.ed._1381_(1945)
however walker_process protects against the misuse of a fraudulent patent by` stripping' the patentee of this exemption and opening the door to a potential antitrust_claim
id
without the protection of this antitrust exemption the holder of a fraudulently obtained patent will be liable for treble damages if its actions created a` reasonable_apprehension' that it intended to enforce the patent against either the plaintiff or the plaintiffs customers
see unitherm food sys. inc. *1354 v. swift-eckrich inc. 375_f.3d_1341 1358 fed.cir.2004 revd on other_grounds 546_u.s._394 126_s.ct._980 163_l.ed.2d_974_(2006)
to determine whether such a reasonable_apprehension exists it is` necessary to appraise the exclusionary_power of the illegal patent.. in terms of the relevant_market for the product involved'
walker_process 382 u.s. at 177 86_s.ct._347
the exclusionary_power of any united_states patent however is confined to the united_states including its territories and its possessions
35 u.s.c.¡±¡± 100 c 154 a 1
thus as a matter of both law and logic a` reasonable_apprehension' of patent enforcement can not exist where neither the plaintiff nor any of its customers may be subject to the exclusionary_power of a patent

that is the case here
despite being given two opportunities to amend its complaint hydril has not alleged that either it or its customers participated attempted to participate or intended to participate in the finished_drill_pipe_market within the united_states
rather hydril has alleged only that it competes with grant_prideco in this market` outside the united_states'

28 alleging that hydril sold finished_drill_pipe in 2001 to azerbaijan international oil company and submitted a quote to one potential customer in each of dubai australia russia indonesia and brazil but making no mention of any participation or intent to participate in the finished_drill_pipe_market within the united_states
because hydril has not alleged that it competes in the finished_drill_pipe_market within the united_states it could not have had a` reasonable_apprehension' that grant_prideco would-or could-enforce its u.s. patent no._6244,631 against hydril in the finished_drill_pipe_market

this is a question of law that should be resolved without any further ado especially since the instant appeal is from a rule 12 b 6 motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim
it should be decided on the sufficiency of the pleadings and is not dependant on the factual record of the case
accordingly rather than punt this question of law back to the district_court we should hold that hydril does not have standing to bring a walker_process antitrust_claim with respect to the finished_drill_pipe_market because it admittedly only competes with grant_prideco in that market` outside the united_states'

we should also affirm the dismissal of hydrils claim that the ¡¬467_patent was infringed
the merger_agreement clearly limits the parties remedies to an action for breach of contract or specific_performance
merger_agreement ¡± 12.12 a
the majority says that the language of section 12.12 a is irrelevant because the merger_agreement and the associated licenses have already been terminated by breach
however the majority explicitly admits that whether the merger_agreement has been breached remains an open question

they also implicitly admit this point by vacating the dismissal of the state_law_claims for a declaratory_judgment of breach sought in paragraphs 84_and_85 of hydrils second_amended complaint
therefore the majoritys holding that hydril may sustain a claim for patent_infringement because the merger_agreement has previously been *1355 terminated by breach is discordant with hydrils own pleadings and position

section 12.12 clearly says that the parties agreed to waive` any and all rights and remedies relating to this agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby sounding in' inter alia` tort.. statute.. or injury outside this agreement'
they also clearly agreed that` [ t ] he sole_basis for any right or remedy by any party against any other_party.. relating to this agreement and the transactions contemplated.. thereby is a breach of contract or specific_performance action for breach of this agreement'
patent rights are statutory_rights and a claim for patent_infringement sounds in tort ; the right to sue for such injuries was waived by the merger_agreement
moreover these rights` relate to' the merger_agreement and are in fact the reason the agreement was consummated in the first place
accordingly the district_court correctly dismissed hydrils infringement action for failure to state a claim because its exclusive remedy under the merger_agreement lies if at all in an action for breach of contract
