appeal no._83-1090
| march_27,_1984
synopsis
suit was brought charging infringement of process and apparatus designed to enable industrial_enterprises to separate solids from a large_volume of liquid
the united_states_district_court for the district of utah bruce s. jenkins j. held that although the patent was valid and enforceable it was not infringed
patent holder appealed
the court of appeals for the federal_circuit markey chief_judge held that 1 patent was infringed notwithstanding claim that infringement was avoided because infringer added mechanical premixing to the apparatus and 2 because infringers brief relied on reverse_statement of law of infringement ignored numerous and unanimous_contrary_authorities distorted a quotation and presented an estoppel_argument based on that distortion infringer would be required to pay patent holder an amount double holders costs on appeal

background
in january 1979 amstar corporation amstar sued envirotech corporation envirotech and energy_fuels_nuclear inc. efn charging infringement of process and apparatus claims 1_through_10 of the889_patent active inducement of others to infringe and contributory infringement
envirotech and efn asserted defenses of non-infringement invalidity under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 and unenforceability for failure to disclose certain prior_art to the patent and trademark office pto and counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment of invalidity non-infringement and unenforceability

the action was tried to the court from june 22 through june_30,_1981
the trial transcript ran over 1,150 pages
some 300 exhibits totaled over 4,000 pages of technical diagrams photos and articles
in-court and videotaped experiments were demonstrated and the court conducted an on-site inspection of a laboratory version of envirotech_equipment
after submission of counsels supplemental memoranda the court issued a memorandum_decision and judgment on may_3,_1983

validity
in its 66-page memorandum_decision the district_court devoted 59 pages to a thorough discussion of the facts and law governing the validity_issue
though the court confessed to a felt inadequacy respecting the involved technology much of its discussion thereof was flawless
finding that the inventions claimed in the889_patent eis_inventions clearly survived certain nonstatutory and thus erroneous tests the court held the patent valid and enforceable.1

the subject_matter of the inventions in suit and the real-world milieu surrounding their nature their birth and growth and the reaction of experts to these inventions and the reactions of the industry and of envirotech were set forth in the courts memorandum_decision

the court generally described the subject_matter of the889_patent [ a ] process and apparatus designed to enable industrial_enterprises to separate solids from a large_volume of liquid over a relatively short period of time
far from letting muddy waters settle in their own good time [ the889_patent discloses ] a continuous flow process that takes advantage of the efficacy of chemical flocculating agents in separating solids-especially finely-divided solids-out of a liquid suspension or emulsion enhanced further by the design of the apparatus and by the specific steps taken in the process

citing 29 internal memoranda in evidence as illustrating the skepticism of envirotechs engineers` re-written the laws of gravity' ;` a new concept.. verdict.. undecided' and the` great effort' of envirotechs engineers technicians and specialists to gather and analyze data in an attempt` to discern the mechanism by which the enviro-clear2 clarifier/thickener operates' the district_court stated

having expended such great efforts to discover if and how the enviro-clear method works it is ironic at least to some extent for envirotech to now assert that the eis_process was obvious to those *1479 skilled in the art
perhaps like a brilliant move in a game of chess it seems so obvious and simple-after you have once seen it played.3
the district_court carefully made the findings required by graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545 148_uspq_459_(1966) ; avoided the hindsight approach on which it said envirotech depended ; rejected the improper each-element-is-old approach ; found that the eis_inventions passed the erroneously` required' tests of` synergism' or` unexpected_results' ; found that the eis_inventions filled a long felt need unmet by others who tried and failed caused abandonment of long standing traditional testing methods for this type of equipment achieved commercial success and trade acceptance and ran contrary to the teachings of the prior_art as synthesized in envirotechs manual just before eis made his inventions ; found that eis proceeded` afoul of the rule' taught by the prior_art against introduction of feed into the settling zone ; found without designating that some of the non-pto considered prior_art was cumulative and some was not ; and reached the conclusion that the eis_inventions would not have been obvious` based upon a preponderance of all the evidence as independently weighed and considered by this court'4

the claims
though claims 1-10 were asserted the appeal can be determined on consideration of independent claims 1 8 and 9 1
a continuous_process for rapidly separating finely divided suspended solid_materials from liquids at a predetermined controlled rate comprising the steps of forming a slurry of solid_agglomerates in an influent_feed of liquid containing finely divided and suspended solids by the addition of a settling aid forming a settling zone having a relatively stationary_upper_boundary and containing previously formed solid_agglomerates introducing said influent liquid_slurry at a central_position within said settling zone and centrally of said previously formed solid_agglomerates arresting the motion of the influent_feed and displacing the same outwardly through said previously formed agglomerates to cause additional agglomeration of the solids and the formation without additional_agitation of a dense settleable mass of the solids and agglomerates continuously removing a dense_underflow from beneath said settling zone at a rate to maintain said relatively stationary_upper_boundary and continuously removing an overflow of clarified liquid from above said upper_boundary of said settling zone whereby separation of the solids and liquids rapidly occurs in said settling zone
8
a continuous_process for treating liquids to remove substances therefrom in the form of solid_particles and agglomerated solid_particles which comprises forming and maintaining a settling zone *1480 of concentrated_slurry containing suspended solid_particles and agglomerated solid_particles of like nature to those to be formed and sep [ sic ] separated mixing solids-containing liquid to be processed with a settling and agglomerating agent said mixing producing a liquid_slurry containing freshly agglomerating solids introducing said liquid_slurry as an influent_feed at a central_position within said settling zone arresting the motion of said influent_feed and displacing the same outwardly through the concentrated_slurry in said settling zone to effect additional agglomerations of the solid_particles whereby relatively large agglomerates of solid_particles are formed which settle rapidly without additional_agitation to form a dense_underflow of agglomerates and entrained solid_particles the point of arresting said influent_feed being close to said central point of introduction of the influent_feed controlling the depth of said settling zone by withdrawal of said dense_underflow so that said settling zone of concentrated_slurry is provided with a relatively stationary_upper_boundary the rate of withdrawal of said dense_underflow being such that said upper_boundary of the settling zone is above the point of arresting the motion of the influent_feed and withdrawing clarified liquid from above said settling zone of concentrated_slurry
9
in an apparatus for rapidly and continuously separating finely divided and suspended solid_materials from liquids at a predetermined and controlled rate a settling vessel having top on bottom_outlet_means inlet means including conduit_means extending to a centralized position within said settling vessel means for introducing a substantally [ sic ] vertical flow of influent_feed of liquid containing freshly agglomerating solid_materials to said centralized_point of entry established by said conduit_means unitary substantially horizontal baffle means adjacent the point of entry established by said conduit_means for arresting and altering the direction of motion of said influent_feed whereby the influent_feed is directed in a horizontally outward direction with respect to said centralized_point of entry means controlling the rate of discharge of solid_materials through said bottom_outlet_means to control and thereby establish settling and sludge zones above and below said centralized_point of entry of influent_feed and means for withdrawing a clarified effluent through said top outlet

infringement
as shown by unchallenged evidence the accused product performs each of the process steps set forth in claims 1_and_8 and contains each of the elements set forth in claim 9
the district_courts attention however became focused on a mechanical mixer inserted in the feedwell of the accused product and on the process step performed by it namely mechanical pre-mixing of the slurry
led to the erroneous belief that amstar had argued for patentability on the basis that eis avoided all mechanical_mixing anywhere in the system under the apparent impression that infringement is avoided when an element of an accused device is not found in the claims and failing to note the presence in claim 8 of the step of pre-mixing in the slurry the district_court stated the combinative_nature of amstars patent_rights effectively limits the scope of enforceable_claims under the eis_patent
if envirotechs combination of elements differs in a material way from that described by eis there is no infringement
a crucial area of difference between the amstar and envirotech_equipment is the use of sophisticated mechanical_mixing to promote flocculation
the envirotech device is constructed around the multichamber impeller mixing system ; amstars enviroclear equipment uses no mixing blades relying instead upon inflow injection of flocculant solution into the feed launder or feed pipe using specially designed nozzles
following initial rejection of the eis application the inventor emphatically argued *1481 that one reason why the enviroclear process was novel non-obvious and patentable was its use of other than mechanical means one point particularly stressed during the interview was the fact that applicants claimed process and apparatus effects a separation of finely divided and suspended solids from an influent_feed at an unusually rapid rate without relying upon either the accretion or growth of agglomerates through forced agitation or the use of a free settling zone

?
?
?
while counsel for eis was not specifically referring to the mixing apparatus now described in the emmett patent and used in the hi-capacity thickeners it seems plain that envirotech relies upon mechanical stirring to achieve good_flocculation while the eis/amstar equipment does not

?
?
?
disclaimer of mechanical_mixing to achieve good_flocculation made in the course of the prosecution of the eis_patent would exclude mechanical_mixing as an` equivalent' as a consequence of this doctrine of` file_wrapper_estoppel'

?
?
?
the eis_patent as issued makes no claim which by its terms encompasses mechanical_mixing to achieve optimum_flocculation
to even accept the argument that the emmett apparatus is an equivalent one would have to wholly disregard the positive effects of the mechanical_mixing system
this can not reasonably be done in light of all of the evidence

?
?
?
this court finds as a matter of fact that the emmett/envirotech invention is not the eis/amstar invention and concludes as a matter of law that the former does not infringe upon the plaintiffs valid rights in the latter within the meaning of 35 u.s.c.¡± 271
amstar retains enforceable_legal_rights in its specific_process but not in the general_result
it must be remembered that combination_patents are to be carefully scrutinized [ citations omitted ]

?
?
?
even assuming that some initial diagrams and models of the envirotech_equipment followed too closely the outline first propounded by eis the paths of the parties have long since diverged and initial resemblance now avoided has done the plaintiff no cognizable injury or wrong
plaintiffs complaint should be dismissed
defendants claims of patent invalidity should be dismissed

issue
whether the district_court erred in reaching its determination of non-infringement

opinion
though literal infringement of a properly interpreted claim is a fact question its determination may be rendered clearly erroneous through an improper interpretation and application of the governing law
in that event as here the determination must be overturned as having resulted from error as a matter of law

the law of infringement requires that the asserted claims be compared with the products or processes accused of infringement
graver_tank & mfg co. v. linde air products co. 339_u.s._605 70_s.ct._854 94_l.ed._1097 85_uspq_328_(1950) ; rel-reeves inc. v. united_states 534_f.2d_274 209_ct.cl._595_(1976) ; astra-sjuco a.b
v. u.s. international trade commission 629_f.2d_682 207_uspq_1_(ccpa_1980)
that was not done here
on the contrary in the seven pages of the memorandum_decision devoted to the infringement_issue it is made clear that the district_court was led to take a wrong turn in determining the infringement_issue

infringement is not determined by comparison between parts of the description in a patent and the accused process or product or by comparison between commercial *1482 products sold by the parties
accused products made sold or used and accused processes performed before suit must be compared with the claims
that products may have been modified after suit is brought and may or may not be accused of infringement does not remove the need for that comparison

modification by mere addition of elements of functions whenever made can not negate infringement without disregard of the long-established hornbook law expressed in cochrane v. deener 94_u.s._780 786 24_l.ed._139_(1876) ; eastern rotorcraft corp. v. united_states 397_f.2d_978 981 104_ct.cl._709 154_uspq_43 45 ct.cl.1968 infringement not avoided by adding an additional element ; mccullough tool co. v. well surveys inc. 343_f.2d_381 402 145_uspq_6 22 10th cir.1965 cert
denied 383_u.s._933 86_s.ct._1061 15_l.ed.2d_851 148_uspq_772_(1966)` but infringement can not be avoided by the mere fact that the accused device is more or less efficient or performs additional functions
`` ; acme highway products corp. v. d.s
brown co. 473_f.2d_849 855 177_uspq_130 135 6th cir
) cert
denied 414_u.s._824 94_s.ct._125 38_l.ed.2d_57 179_uspq_321_(1973)` an accused device can not escape infringement by merely adding features if it otherwise has adopted the basic features of the patent`
further the law recognizes the irrelevance of apparatus distinctions in determining infringement of process claims
international glass co. v. united_states 408_f.2d_395 400 187_ct.cl._376 161_uspq_116_(ct.cl.1969)

thus an accused product could not be found non-infringing because it lacked a flared outlet feed pipe that element being irrelevant because it is present only in non-asserted claim 11
nor could substitution of a rotating disc for the baffle of claim 9 escape infringement the two being equivalent and the substitution bearing no relation to claims 1_and_8
nor could absence from the claims of a limitation to mechanical_mixing before introduction of the slurry into the settling zone be thought controlling when claim 8 specifically mentions pre-mixing whether or not mechanical and pre-mixing bears no relation whatever to claims 1_and_9
similarly the presence of additional` lamella' plates in some envirotech drawings can not negate infringement lamella_plates being irrelevant because they are not included in the accused products as sold because they have no effect on the processes of claims 1_and_8 and because they are not an element of product_claim 9

often as here consideration of the infringement_issue may be benefitted by recognition of the findings made in considering the validity_issue envirotech tried various schemes to` neutralize enviro-clears influence' and` counteract the enviro-clear threat' ; envirotechs apparatus and process` [ bear ] a striking resemblance to the preferred embodiment of the amstar apparatus and process described in the eis_patent'5

*1483 important to determination of the infringement_issue also are the findings establishing the pioneer nature of the eis_inventions eis abandoned the traditional design of thickening equipment ; results obtained were` surprising'` striking'` unexpected' and` synergistic' ; eis process is` far more effective' than conventional equipment ;` nothing.. indicated the kind of results one could obtain if the eis_process was used' ; the entire industry testing procedure was modified or abandoned` wholly dependent upon the teachings of the eis_patent'

the statute provides no support for the district_courts statement that` the combinative_nature of amstars patent_rights effectively limits the scope of enforceable_claims under the eis_patent'
there is no separate classification of` combination_patents' and no basis for considering claims to combinations of elements differently from any other
richdel inc. v. sunspool corp. 714_f.2d_1573 1579 219_uspq_8 12 fed.cir.1983 ; medtronic inc. v. cardiac_pacemakers 721_f.2d_1563 220_uspq_97 100 fed.cir.1983

as discussed infra a statement made during prosecution of the application for the889_patent which related to avoidance of mixing in the settling zone can not be applied as a form of estoppel precluding application of the claims to envirotechs apparatus which also avoided mixing in the settling zone

the district_courts memorandum_decision overlooked the claim charts px 32 introduced and analyzed at trial and presented here as part of amstars brief on appeal
those charts establish unequivocally that the accused apparatus employed at envirotechs pilot plants and as originally sold to eagle coal and dock and to efn constituted literal infringements of claims 1 8 and 9

the record further illustrates that the modifications assertedly made by envirotech whenever they may have been made are either irrelevant or fail to escape infringement
the accused products including those modified are the same they perform the same function in the same way and they achieve as the district_court found the same result as the claimed inventions
see sanitary refrigerator co. v. winters 280_u.s._30 41-42 50_s.ct._9 12-13 74_l.ed._147 3_uspq_40 44 1929

in this case the merely colorable variations so vigorously pressed by envirotech are of a kind with those described by the supreme court as fostering` the piracy' and consequent defeat of the disclosure purpose of the patent_system
graver_tank supra 339 u.s. at 607 70 s.ct.at 855 85 uspq at 330
infringement is clear on this record.6

envirotechs brief7
the brief filed by envirotech on this appeal presented to assist this court in determining that the finding of non-infringement was not clearly erroneous contains not one reference to any step of process claims 1_and_8 or to any element of product_claim 9 that is even asserted to be absent from the accused processes and products of envirotech

unable to point to any part of eis claimed inventions not appropriated by it envirotech says it avoided infringement solely because it added mechanical pre-mixing *1484 in the feedwell.8 unable to escape or distinguish any of the many authorities cited in amstars brief clearly explaining why that position is contrary to law envirotech simply ignores them all

envirotechs brief says the modifications discussed by the district_court played no role in its non-infringement finding and that the district_court properly found non-infringement because it held that the claims of the889_patent in envirotechs words` did not encompass the mechanical_mixing employed by envirotech to achieve optimum_flocculation'
envirotechs brief then describes its pre-mixing impellers and baffles and says` they can not therefore infringe any claim of the eis_patent' emphasis added
of course` they' can not infringe` they' are not charged as infringements` they' as the authorities make plain are simply and totally irrelevant see e.g. eastern rotorcraft supra 397 f.2d at 981 104_ct.cl._709 154 uspq at 45

envirotechs brief repeatedly states without record citation that the district_court` compared the envirotech apparatus with the eis claims' and at the same time that` a claim-by-claim determination would have been superfluous once the court found a feature [ envirotechs mechanical pre-mixing ] missing from all the claims'
that view would stand the law of infringement on its head and would fatally undermine the long-established legal principle that non-infringement is shown when an element or step in the claims is missing from the accused product or process not vice-versa

envirotech then says that the district_court interpreted the scope of the claims in suit as excluding envirotechs mechanical pre-mixing in the feedwell and that the claims can not therefore be expanded to include a functional_equivalent of that pre-mixing in the feedwell
the argument is in all charity disingenuous
the list of elements and steps` excluded' by the claims in suit as by every patent claim is infinite
nor is there any need whatever to` expand' the claims to` include' a functional_equivalent of envirotechs pre-mixing in the feedwell
the existence and function of pre-mixing in the feedwell though the district_court was led astray respecting them are simply of no moment whatever
it is not the law that each element of envirotechs accused process and product or an equivalent of each element must be found in the claims
the claims are not accused of infringing anything
envirotech is obviously free to use its pre-mixing chamber per se to its hearts content.9

pre-mixing would be relevant only if it were listed as an element or step in a claim and if it were absent from envirotechs apparatus and process
when as here envirotech adds its pre-mixing chamber to apparatus that in its structure and in the process it performs literally infringes claims 1 8 and 9 infringement is not by that addition avoided

envirotech says amstar seeks to define a` gossamer' boundary for the claims and attempts a` total eclipse of the technology where the district_court found the penumbra of the claims strictly delineated'
as sole support for that statement envirotech quotes the district_court` amstar retains enforceable_legal_rights in its specific_process but not in the general_result' and its statements that the claims` exclude' and do not` encompass' mechanical_mixing in the feedwell
nowhere does or can envirotech indicate wherein it is not employing precisely the claimed` specific_process' or wherein an unpatentable` general_result' *1485 is at all relevant
nor as above indicated does envirotech support the district_courts misinterpretation of the law of infringement reflected in its` exclude' and` does not encompass' statements.10

envirotechs effort to create a prosecution_history` file wrapper' estoppel wastes the courts and opposing counsels time because the effort is devoted to` proving' what is unchallenged and irrelevant i.e. that claims 1_and_9` clearly' do not` include' mechanical_mixing in the feedwell.11

moreover envirotech argues contrary to the record that exclusion of such pre-mixing was the sole basis for allowance and goes on to employ a distorted quotation from eis prosecution_history the distortion constituting a deletion of precisely the language which totally undermines its argument

as presented to the court by envirotech the quote is.. [ f ] orced hydraulic or mechanical_agitation to obtain growth or accretion of agglomerate_particles.. is entirely contrary to the concept of applicants invention and would defeat applicants purpose through action of fluid_forces in shear which would disrupt and break up the dense_clumps of agglomerates which form as a result of applicants processing

as it appears in the prosecution_history the full segment reads material underlined is that deleted by envirotech with respect to the cited prior_art it was pointed out that each of the patents to robinson parker et al
and mcbride relied upon a forced hydraulic or mechanical_agitation to obtain a growth or accretion of agglomerate_particles which were then forced upward by the fluid flow to a sludge or solids collector near the top of the liquid-solids contact zone
such concept is entirely contrary to the concept of applicants invention and would defeat applicants purpose through action of fluid_forces in shear which would disrupt and break up the dense_clumps of agglomerates which form as a result of applicants processing

the portions deleted by envirotech make clear that the remarks were directed to reactor-clarifiers of the prior_art in which agglomerate_particles are` forced upward'
that prior_art did not deal with` thickeners' in which solids are settled by gravity in a settling zone
indeed that prior_art was so remote from the claimed inventions that envirotech presented no testimony whatever about them at trial

though its memorandum_decision contains conflicting statements touching the matter the district_court was clearly influenced by the effort of envirotech to construct a fog of a false estoppel
the district_court said` disclaimer of mechanical_mixing to achieve good_flocculation made in the course of the prosecution of the eis_patent would exclude mechanical_mixing as anequivalent as a consequence of this doctrine offile_wrapper_estoppel`

it is absolutely clear from the uncropped quote above and from the prior_art listed in the full quotation that eis counsel was distinguishing from that prior_art on the basis that eis inventions avoided mixing in the settling zone and that counsels remarks had nothing whatever to do with mixing of the slurry before it entered that zone
that fact is further confirmed by the submission contemporaneously with the quoted remarks of claim 1 with its introduction of the slurry into the settling zone` without additional_agitation' of the solids mass in that zone of claim 8 with its additional step of` mixing producing a liquid_slurry' to be introduced into the settling zone a claimed step can hardly be held to have been` disclaimed' and of claim 9 which makes no reference whatever *1486 to mixing
confirmation resides also in the findings of the district_court that the eis_process is one for` settling slurries of finely divided solids without reliance on mechanical_agitation' emphasis added and that` counsel for eis was not specifically referring to the mixing apparatus now described in the emmet [ envirotech ] patent and used [ in the accused products ]'
envirotech simply ignores the clear showing in the record which directly refutes its` estoppel' argument

envirotech as the claims specify avoids mechanical_agitation where the inventions are i.e. in the settling zone
envirotechs` estoppel' argument is simply devoid of merit

distortion of the record by deletion of critical language in quoting from the record reflects a lack of the candor required by the model rules of professional conduct rule 3.3 1983 wastes the time of the court and of opposing counsel and imposes unnecessary costs on the parties and on fellow citizens whose taxes support this court and its staff
a quotation containing deletions that so clearly distort the meaning and relevance of the quotation as to render it misleading will not in this court be encouraged by acquiescence.12

costs
because envirotechs brief relies on a reverse_statement of the law of infringement ignores the numerous and unanimous_contrary_authorities called to its attention by amstars main brief distorts a quotation and presents an estoppel_argument based on that distortion envirotech shall pay to amstar an amount equating to double amstars costs on this appeal

an abuse of the judicial process resides as much in the presentation of a knowingly frivolous defense as in the filing of a knowingly frivolous complaint or appeal
no cross appeal was filed and validity is not challenged on appeal
apparently amstar presented to the district_court no claim for attorney_fees and costs specifically relating to this` ironic' defense
4
the district_court unnecessarily undertook the extra effort involved in independently re-determining validity ab initio rather than determining on all the evidence whether envirotech had carried its burden of proving invalidity as the statute requires 35 u.s.c.¡± 282 ; spoke of` synergism' and` unexpected_results' as requirements rather than evidence see kansas jack inc. v. kuhn 719_f.2d_1144 1150 219_uspq_8 57 860 fed.cir.1983 ; quoted indications that` combination_patents' are somehow different and require special scrutiny see medtronic inc. v. cardiac_pacemakers inc. 721_f.2d_1563 220_uspq_97 99-100 fed.cir.1983 ; stated that the presumption of validity is` weakened' when non-considered pertinent art is introduced ; discussed the obviousness of the` patent' rather than of the claimed inventions ; and used the present tense` is obvious' rather than the statutorily required` would have been obvious' see rosemount inc. v. beckman instruments inc. 727_f.2d_1540 at 1543_n._3_(fed.cir.1984)
those errors however tilted in favor of envirotech and do not in this case affect the district_courts holding of validity

amstars brief refers to envirotechs` willful and deliberate infringement'
envirotechs brief makes no claim that counsel was consulted before it elected to produce and sell the accused products
the district_courts findings would appear to support the` willful and deliberate' characterization
nonetheless no finding of willful infringement was made and the question is therefore not before us
presumably the district_court will consider on remand amstars requests for such findings and for costs treble damages and attorney_fees
similarly though amstar points to envirotechs corporate policy of disregarding the patent_rights of others as reflected in its being held in contempt of court four times in a patent case peterson_filters & engineering co. v. eimco corp. 155_uspq_89_(d.utah_1967) affd 406_f.2d_431_(10th_cir.1968) cert

envirotechs approach to the patent_system and its disregard of plaintiffs patent_rights and court orders in peterson_filters is of general interest however in light of its having sought and obtained a patent on one of its modified versions emmet
though that happened seven years after the889_patent issued envirotech did not cite the eis_inventions to the pto a lapse on which the district_court commented` ironically the emmet patent does not list the eis_patent as a relevant prior_art example'
6
the district_courts treatment of differences in the amstar and envirotech commercial products included a statement repeated in envirotechs brief here that amstars approach to equivalence could lead to a conclusion that except for a simple design difference` a phillips head screwdriver is a standard screwdriver'
the district_courts error of law repetition of which is sought here by envirotech lies in the failure as above indicated to compare the accused products and processes with the claimed products and processes
7
envirotech challenges none of the findings on which rests the district_courts conclusion that the889_patent is valid
nor does envirotech challenge the district_courts finding that it produced the accused products because its thickener business was` in jeopardy' as a result of amstars presence in what envirotechs engineers called its` sandbox'
8
the equally irrelevant presence of lamella_plates and absence of a flared feedwell outlet or a flat baffle plate are not mentioned in envirotechs brief
at oral argument it was asserted without support in the record that some product of envirotech discharged the slurry longitudinally rather than outwardly into the settling zone
9
or to refrain from its use
the uncontradicted testimony at trial was that envirotechs customers simply deactivated or removed the mechanical mixers in the feedwell of envirotechs products
whether mixers in the feedwell were or were not used is however totally irrelevant
10
envirotech says its pre-mixing in the feedwell` promote [ s ] flocculation throughout the apparatus' but there is no evidence of record to support that statement
if there were the assertion would nevertheless be irrelevant in view of the clear infringement of the claimed process and product_claims
11
the effort could never establish an absence of` mixing' from claim 8

in the words of elihu root` [ a ] bout half of the practice of a decent lawyer is telling would-be clients that they are damned fools and should stop'
