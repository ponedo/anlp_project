aventis_pharma_s.a. and sanofi-aventis_u.s. l.l.c
( collectively` sanofi' filed suit against hospira inc.` hospira' and apotex_inc. and apotex_corp. collectively` apotex' under 35 u.s.c.¡± 271 e for infringement of u.s. patent nos._5750,561` ¡¬561_patent` and 5,714,512` ¡¬512_patent`
after a bench_trial the district *1328 court found inter_alia that claim 5 of the ¡¬561_patent and claim 7 of the ¡¬512_patent were invalid for obviousness under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 that claim 7 of the ¡¬512_patent was not infringed and that both the ¡¬561 and ¡¬512_patent s were unenforceable for inequitable_conduct
sanofi has appealed
for the reasons set forth below we affirm

i
background
the ¡¬561 and ¡¬512_patent s are pharmaceutical patents related to the administration of the chemotherapy cancer drug docetaxel which is marketed under the brand-name taxotere
the patents are assigned to aventis_pharma_s.a. and sanofi-aventis_u.s. l.l.c
is the holder of the new drug application for taxotere
docetaxel is a successor to the cancer drug paclitaxel marketed as taxol and the composition for docetaxel was covered by now-expired u.s. patent no._4814,470` ¡¬470_patent`
both docetaxel and paclitaxel belong to the class of compounds known as taxanes

taxanes are administered through an intravenous infusion accomplished by slowly delivering the drug in a diluted aqueous solution called a` perfusion'
taxanes however have low solubility in water and tend to precipitate i.e. form solid clumps and come out of solution
to delay precipitation taxanes are mixed with additives like surfactants and ethanol ; these additives stabilize the perfusion and delay the amount of time before precipitation occurs
the taxane is combined with the additives to form a` stock_solution' which is then mixed into an injectable aqueous solution such as saline to form a perfusion

in the prior_art the surfactant cremophor was used with taxanes to form the stock_solution but it was known to trigger serious allergic reactions including anaphylactic shock
¡¬561_patent col.1 ll.59-63 ; ¡¬512_patent col.2 ll.31-35
the ¡¬561 and ¡¬512_patent s relate to using surfactants other than cremophor with docetaxel and decreasing the amount of ethanol to reduce alcohol_intoxication and anaphylactic_effects in patients
after hospira and apotex applied for u.s. food and drug administration` fda' approval to market generic versions of taxotere sanofi filed suit against them for infringement of the ¡¬561 and ¡¬512_patent s. only claim 5 of the ¡¬ 561 patent and claim 7 of the ¡¬512_patent are at issue on appeal

the ¡¬561_patent is titled` compositions containing taxane_derivatives' and describes taxane_compositions including a perfusion that avoids anaphylactic and alcohol_intoxication_manifestations
claim 5 of the ¡¬561_patent recites 5
a perfusion which contains approximately 1 mg/ml or less of compound of formula as defined in claim 1 and which contains less than 35 ml/1 of ethanol and less than 35 ml/1 of polysorbate wherein said perfusion is capable of being injected without anaphylactic or alcohol_intoxication_manifestations being associated therewith

the ¡¬512_patent is titled` new compositions containing taxane_derivatives' and discloses taxane_compositions with reduced ethanol
claim 7 depends from claims 1_and_6
as corrected by a certificate of correction those claims recite 1
a composition comprising a compound of the formula

?
*1329 in which ar is unsubstituted phenyl r7 is phenyl or tert_butoxy r6 is hydrogen r5 is acetyloxy or hydroxy r3 and r4 taken together form an oxo radical r1 is hydroxy and r2 is hydrogen said composition being dissolved in a surfactant selected from polysorbate polyoxyethylated vegetable oil and polyethoxylated castor oil said composition being essentially free or free of ethanol
6
the composition of claim 1 wherein r5 is hydroxy and r7 is tert_butoxy
7
the composition of claim 6 wherein said surfactant is polysorbate
after a bench_trial the court found that claim 7 of the ¡¬512_patent was invalid as obvious and not infringed by hospira or apotex
with respect to claim 5 of the ¡¬561_patent the court found that hospira and apotex did infringe but concluded that the claim was obvious
the court also determined that the ¡¬512 and ¡¬561_patent s were unenforceable for inequitable_conduct

ii
discussion
on appeal sanofi challenges the district_courts construction of two claim_terms` perfusion' in claim 5 of the ¡¬561_patent and` essentially free or free of ethanol' in claim 7 of the ¡¬512_patent
based on the district_courts constructions sanofi argues that the court erred in finding that both claims were invalid for obviousness under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 and that apotexs and hospiras accused products did not infringe claim 7 of the ¡¬512_patent
additionally sanofi contends that the court erred in finding that the ¡¬561 and ¡¬512_patent s were unenforceable for inequitable_conduct
we have jurisdiction under 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

a
claim 5 of the ¡¬561_patent
claim construction is a question of law reviewed de novo
cybor corp. v. fas techs. 138_f.3d_1448 1454-55 fed.cir.1998 en banc
claim terms generally are construed in accordance with the ordinary and customary meaning they would have to one of ordinary_skill in the art in light of the specification and the prosecution_history
phillips v. awh corp. 415_f.3d_1303 1312 fed.cir.2005 en banc

before the district_court the parties initially agreed to construe` perfusion' in claim 5 of the ¡¬561_patent as` a solution suitable for infusion into patients including at least active_pharmaceutical_ingredient and an aqueous_infusion_fluid such as physiological saline or glucose'
aventis_pharma_s.a. v. hospira inc. 743_f.supp.2d_305 332 d.del.2010
the parties however later realized that they did not agree on the meaning of the phrase` suitable for infusion into patients' in their proposed construction leading sanofi to ask the district_court to require that the claimed` perfusion' also be effective for treatment safe and stable i.e. not precipitate for at least eight hours
the court declined to impose these additional limitations and instead *1330 construed` perfusion' to mean` an injectable_solution containing the active_pharmaceutical_ingredient and an aqueous_infusion_fluid'
id.at 333
on appeal sanofi argues that the district_court erred in not construing` perfusion' to include these additional efficacy safety and stability limitations

we can easily dispose of sanofis first two limitations
neither the claims the specification nor the prosecution_history suggest that the claimed perfusion must satisfy certain safety or efficacy standards
we previously have refused to impose such limitations when not required by the language of the claims or the specification see mitsubishi chem corp. v. barr labs. inc. 435_fed.appx._927 934-35 fed.cir.2011 ; iovate health scis. inc. v. bio-engineered supplements & nutrition inc. 586_f.3d_1376 1382 fed.cir.2009 and decline to do so here

regarding sanofis eight-hour_stability_limitation sanofi does not contend that` perfusion' as that term is normally understood in the art includes such a limitation
instead sanofi argues that based on how the term is used in the context of the ¡¬561_patent the claimed` perfusion' must demonstrate at least eight hours of stability
see oral_argument 3:05-3:10 available at http //www.cafc.uscourts.gov/oral-argument-recordings/2011-1018/all
this court recently reiterated the stringent standard for narrowing a claim_term beyond its plain and ordinary_meaning in thorner v. sony computer entertainment america l.l.c. 669_f.3d_1362_(fed.cir.2012)
there we explained that we will only interpret a claim_term more narrowly than its ordinary_meaning under two circumstances` 1 when a patentee sets out a definition and acts as [ its ] own_lexicographer or 2 when the patentee disavows the full scope of a claim_term either in the specification or during prosecution'
id.at 1365

`` to act as its own_lexicographer a patentee mustclearly set forth a definition of the disputed claim_term other than its plain and ordinary_meaning'
id
( quoting ccs fitness inc. v. brunswick corp. 288_f.3d_1359 1366 fed.cir.2002
in other words` the patentee mustclearly express an intent to redefine the term'
id
this clear expression need not be in haec verba but may be inferred from clear limiting descriptions of the invention in the specification or prosecution_history
similarly to disavow claim_scope` [ t ] he patentee may demonstrate intent to deviate from the ordinary and accustomed meaning of a claim_term by including in the specification expressions of manifest exclusion or restriction representing a clear disavowal of claim_scope'
id.at 1366 quoting teleflex inc. v. ficosa n. am corp. 299_f.3d_1313 1325 fed.cir.2002
moreover` [ i ] t is.. not enough that the only_embodiments or all of the embodiments contain a particular_limitation' to limit a claim_term beyond its ordinary_meaning
id
here because neither exception applies the district_court correctly did not include an eight-hour_stability_limitation in its construction of` perfusion'

we begin our analysis with the language of the claims
phillips 415 f.3d at 1312
claim 5 requires that the` perfusion' be` capable of being injected without anaphylactic or alcohol_intoxication_manifestations' but contains no limitations with respect to the claimed perfusions stability
had the patentee similarly intended to require that the` perfusion' display a certain duration of stability it could have included such a limitation in the claim but notably did not
by expressly identifying the specific characteristics of the` perfusion' i.e. that it is not associated with` anaphylactic or alcohol_intoxication_manifestations' the plain language of claim 5 indicates that the term has its ordinary *1331 meaning subject only to those specifically enumerated limitations

this interpretation of` perfusion' also is consistent with the teachings of the specification
although the specification does refer to perfusions with a stability of at least eight hours see ¡¬561_patent col.2 ll.43-45` the new perfusions [ referring to examples in the specification ] are stable from a physical standpoint that is to say no precipitation phenomenon is seen to appear within approximately 8 hours
`` and the disclosed examples of perfusions have stabilities exceeding eight hours see id.at col.2 l.59-col.3 l.26 these general descriptions of the characteristics of embodiments do not suffice to limit the claims
see thorner 669 f.3d at 1366` it is likewise not enough that the only_embodiments or all of the embodiments contain a particular_limitation`
indeed the specification expressly instructs that the disclosed examples` are not to be considered as limiting the invention'
¡¬561_patent col.2 ll.53-54
moreover in contrast to the specifications discussion of anaphylactic and alcohol_intoxication_manifestations nothing in the specification indicates that a minimum stability of eight hours is an essential feature of the claimed perfusion or an advantage of the perfusion over the prior_art
see liebel-flarsheim co. v. medrad inc. 358_f.3d_898 906-09 fed.cir.2004 distinguishing cases where the court narrowly construed an otherwise broad claim_term

nor does the prosecution_history evidence a clear and unmistakable disavowal of claim_scope
the prosecution_history can offer insight into the meaning of a particular claim_term but the` [ c ] laim language and the specification generally carry greater weight'
htc corp. v. ipcom gmbh & co. 667_f.3d_1270 1276 fed.cir.2012
here the patentees observation during prosecution that the perfusions in the tarr_reference demonstrated signs of precipitation after four hours and thirty minutes neither indicates that the claimed perfusion has a special definition nor clearly and unmistakably manifests the patentees intention to limit claim 5 to perfusions that are stable for at least eight hours
the tarr_reference was not directed to the two-solvent_solution of claim 5 but to a prior_art three-solvent_solution ; the argument was that the presence of the third solvent materially affected the characteristics of the claimed composition

lastly we reject sanofis argument that the district_court improperly relied on extrinsic_evidence in the form of expert_testimony in construing this claim_term
according to sanofi because the intrinsic_evidence alone dictates the proper construction of perfusion any extrinsic_evidence is irrelevant
a district_court however has the discretion to take expert_testimony into account in determining the ordinary_meaning of a claim_term to one skilled in the art
phillips 415 f.3d at 1319` [ b ] ecause extrinsic_evidence can help educate the court regarding the field of the invention and can help the court determine what a person of ordinary_skill in the art would understand claim_terms to mean it is permissible for the district_court in its sound discretion to admit and use such evidence`
here the district_court heard testimony from both sides experts including testimony from sanofis expert dr. howard burris which was consistent with the intrinsic_evidence and supports the conclusion that the ordinary_meaning of a perfusion does not include the stability limitation proposed by sanofi
consequently the district_court did not err in relying on extrinsic_evidence in construing this claim_term

in sum we conclude that the patentee did not narrow the ordinary_meaning of` perfusion' in claim 5 of the ¡¬561_patent by either acting as its own_lexicographer or disclaiming claim_scope and therefore *1332 agree with the district_court that a` perfusion' is simply` an injectable_solution containing the active_pharmaceutical_ingredient and an aqueous_infusion_fluid'

having affirmed the courts claim construction we next address the district_courts conclusion that claim 5 was invalid as obvious under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103
a patent is invalid for obviousness` if the differences between the subject_matter sought to be patented and the prior_art are such that the subject_matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary_skill in the art to which said subject_matter pertains'
35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a
`` obviousness is a question of law based on underlying findings of fact'
in re kubin 561_f.3d_1351 1355 fed.cir.2009
these underlying factual inquiries are 1 the scope and content of the prior_art ; 2 the differences between the prior_art and the claims at issue ; 3 the level of ordinary_skill in the art ; and 4 any relevant secondary considerations such as commercial success long felt but unsolved needs and the failure of others
ksr int l co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 406 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007) citing graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 17-18 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966)
on appeal from a bench_trial we review the district_courts legal determination that an invention is obvious de novo and the courts underlying factual determinations for clear_error
eli lilly & co. v. teva pharms
usa inc. 619_f.3d_1329 1336 fed.cir.2010

the district_court found that claim 5 was obvious in light of the prior_art including the gueritte-voegelein reference` gv_reference' and the dictionnaire vidal` vidal_reference'
during oral argument sanofis counsel confirmed that under the district_courts construction of` perfusion' sanofi did not dispute that claim 5 was obvious based on the prior_art
oral_argument 22:23-22:45
because we have affirmed the district_courts construction of` perfusion' we also affirm the district_courts judgment that claim 5 of the ¡¬ 561 patent is invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103

b
claim 7 of the ¡¬512_patent
sanofi argues that the district_court erred in construing the claim_term` essentially free or free of ethanol' in claim 7 of the ¡¬512_patent as meaning that the claimed perfusion contains` the same amount of ethanol as a stock_solution with no more than 5 %_ethanol by volume'
aventis 743 f.supp.2d at 359
we need not resolve this issue however because its resolution does not require reversal of the district_courts obviousness determination

claim 7 of the ¡¬512_patent claims a` composition' which the parties agree can be either a stock_solution or a perfusion
with respect to stock_solutions the parties also agree that the phrase` essentially free or free of ethanol' in claim 7 means` no more than 5 %_ethanol by volume'
id
relying on this construction the district_court found that claim 7 was obvious noting that the` the specification and claims of the prior_art ¡¬470_patent [ ].. disclose and contemplate both ethanol-containing and essentially ethanol-free stock_solutions..' id.at 337_n._15_(emphasis_added)
sanofi has not addressed the district_courts obviousness finding with respect to stock_solutions in its opening brief
to the extent that sanofis conclusory statement in its reply that there is not` art in the record of polysorbate stock_solutions containing less than 5 %_ethanol' amounts to a challenge to the invalidity finding that argument is waived
advanced magnetic closures inc. v. rome fastener corp. 607_f.3d_817 833 fed.cir.2010` this court has consistently held that a party waives an argument not raised in its opening *1333 brief`
thus regardless of whether the court correctly construed` essentially free or free of ethanol' as it relates to perfusions the district_courts unchallenged finding that the claimed stock_solutions were obvious in light of the prior_art also renders the` composition' in claim 7 obvious
see titanium metals corp. v. banner 778_f.2d_775 782 fed.cir.1985` it is.. an elementary principle of patent law that when as by a recitation of ranges or otherwise a claim covers several compositions the claim isanticipated if one of them is in the prior_art`
we accordingly affirm the district_courts judgment that claim 7 of the ¡¬512_patent is invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103

c. inequitable conduct
sanofi also appeals the district_courts determination that both the ¡¬512 and ¡¬561_patent s are unenforceable for inequitable_conduct
as an initial matter sanofi contends that the district_court abused its discretion in allowing hospira and apotex to amend their pleadings after the scheduling_order_deadline to add allegations related to inequitable_conduct without first finding that hospira and apotex had established` good_cause' as required by federal rule of civil procedure 16 b 4
we review a district_courts granting of a motion to amend pleadings under the law of the regional circuit
creative compounds l.l.c
v. starmark labs. 651_f.3d_1303 1309 fed.cir.2011
in the third circuit such decisions are reviewed for an abuse of discretion
race tires am. inc. v. hoosier racing tire corp. 614_f.3d_57 73 3d cir.2010
under rule 16 b 4 a scheduling_order` may be modified only for good_cause and with the judges consent'
fed.r.civ.p
16 b 4

here the parties do not dispute that the scheduling_order-and consequently rule 16 b 4s` good_cause' requirement-apply to hospiras amendment
with respect to apotexs amendment however both apotex and hospira argue that apotex was never subject to the scheduling_order and therefore did not need to demonstrate good_cause to amend its pleadings
assuming without deciding that the deadlines in the scheduling_order covered both apotex and hospira we can not say that the district_court abused its discretion in allowing the amendments
hospira timely asserted a claim for inequitable_conduct in its original counterclaims but shortly after deposing named-inventor jean-louis fabre moved to amend its allegations after the scheduling_order_deadline to specifically identify the withheld vidal and gv_references
the district_court granted the motion finding that` the timing of hospiras motion [ did ] not appear to have been the product of bad faith' and that sanofi would not be unduly prejudiced by the amendment
apotex then filed a motion to amend its counterclaims to add a claim of inequitable_conduct which the district_court also granted
given the circumstances of this case including the temporal proximity of the amendments to inventor_fabres deposition there was good_cause for the amendments and the district_court did not abuse its discretion in allowing them
consequently we turn to the merits

the district_court found that the vidal and gv_references were material to patentability and that inventor_fabre intentionally withheld them with the intent to deceive the u.s. patent and trademark_office` pto'
based on these findings the court concluded that the ¡¬512 and ¡¬561_patent s were unenforceable for inequitable_conduct
sanofi argues that we should reverse the courts inequitable_conduct judgment because fabre explained why he *1334 did not disclose these references to the pto and thus the courts finding that he acted with the intent to deceive was not the single most reasonable_inference that could be drawn from the evidence
additionally sanofi contends that these references were not material to patentability because they were duplicative of references that were before the pto
in response apotex and hospira argue that the district_courts intent_findings are supported by both the evidence and the courts credibility_determinations
regarding materiality they maintain that the district_court properly applied the but-for materiality analysis in concluding that the references were material to patentability
we agree with apotex and hospira

in reviewing the district_courts inequitable_conduct determination we review the courts underlying factual_findings for clear_error and its ultimate decision as to inequitable_conduct for an abuse of discretion
star_scientific inc. v. r.j. reynolds tobacco co. 537_f.3d_1357 1365 fed.cir.2008
to prevail on an inequitable_conduct defense a defendant must establish both the materiality of the withheld reference and the applicants intent to deceive the pto
therasense inc. v. becton dickinson & co. 649_f.3d_1276 1290 fed.cir.2011 en banc
in therasense this court rejected the` sliding scale' approach to proving inequitable_conduct` where a weak showing of intent may be found sufficient based on a strong showing of materiality and vice versa'
id
instead we instructed that` [ i ] ntent and materiality are separate requirements'
id
additionally we held that but-for materiality is the standard for evaluating the materiality prong of the analysis unless there is affirmative egregious misconduct
id.at 1292
in this case although the district_court did not have the benefit of our therasense opinion when it rendered its inequitable_conduct decision the court nevertheless found that the withheld references were but-for material to patentability and made distinct intent and materiality findings rather than employing the now-abrogated sliding scale approach
consequently as set forth below we conclude that the courts inequitable_conduct determination withstands even the more rigorous standard adopted in therasense

1
materiality
a prior_art reference` is but-for material if the pto would not have allowed a claim had it been aware of the undisclosed prior_art'
therasense 649 f.3d at 1291
unlike the clear and convincing_evidence standard for invalidating a patent in the district_court under 35 u.s.c.¡±¡± 102_and_103 the standard for establishing but-for materiality in the inequitable_conduct context only requires a preponderance of the evidence` giv [ ing ] claims their broadest reasonable construction'
id.at 1291-92
as a result when a` claim is properly invalidated in district_court based on the deliberately withheld reference then that reference is necessarily material' for purposes of the inequitable_conduct inquiry
id.at 1292
on the other hand even if the withheld reference is not sufficient to invalidate the claim in district_court` the reference may be material if it would have blocked patent issuance under the ptos different evidentiary standards'
id

here we have affirmed the district_courts finding that the ¡¬561 and ¡¬512_patent s were invalid based on inter_alia the withheld gv and vidal_references
because such references are necessarily material to patentability the district_court did not err in finding that the materiality requirement was established

2
intent
to satisfy the intent requirement` the accused infringer must prove *1335 by clear and convincing_evidence that the applicant knew of the reference knew that it was material and made a deliberate decision to withhold it'
id
in therasense we confirmed that inequitable_conduct requires clear and convincing_evidence of a specific_intent to deceive the pto and that` the specific_intent to deceive must bethe single most reasonable_inference able to be drawn from the evidence
`` id
( quoting star_scientific 537 f.3d at 1366
`` this court reviews the district_courts factual_findings regarding what reasonable_inferences may be drawn from the evidence for clear_error'
id.at 1291
in this case the district_court heard extensive testimony from inventor_fabre regarding both the vidal and gv_references and the courts finding that fabre acted with a specific_intent to deceive the pto in withholding those references is not clearly erroneous

the vidal_reference discloses sandozs experience using polysorbate 80 as a surfactant with the cancer drug etoposide
during the trial fabre testified that he did not cite the vidal_reference to the pto because the etoposide-type_experiments he and his co-inventors performed with doxcetaxel resulted in perfusions that did not demonstrate eight hours of stability
according to fabre he believed that these experiments were failures and that he therefore did not need to disclose the vidal_reference to the pto
sanofi argues that based on this testimony the district_court erred in finding that fabre had the specific_intent to deceive the pto because that finding was not the single most reasonable_inference that could be drawn
we disagree

the district_court considered fabres explanation for withholding the vidal_reference and expressly rejected it based on both the evidence presented and the finding that fabre lacked credibility
specifically the district_court relied on fabres testimony that he learned of replacing cremophor with polysorbate 80 from the vidal_reference and that the sandoz experience disclosed in the reference was one of the` main factors that shaped [ his ] thinking' in choosing polysorbate 80 and led him to believe that replacing cremophor with polysorbate 80 would avoid anaphylactic manifestations
aventis 743 f.supp.2d at 351-53
this testimony also was consistent with a sanofi internal memorandum acknowledging the side effects associated with cremophor and noting that sandoz had used polysorbate 80 i.e.` tween' instead of cremophor in its etoposide product
id.at 351 ; j.a
5666

in making its intent finding the district_court also emphasized that in fabre and his co-inventors submissions to the pto they cited the rowinsky reference which identified the` problem' the inventors were trying to solve-i.e. the anaphylactic reactions associated with cremophor-but did not cite the vidal_reference which revealed the` solution' -i.e. the switch from cremophor to polysorbate 80
aventis 743 f.supp.2d at 352
the court found that` [ t ] here simply is no justification for telling the [ pto ] about the prior_art disclosing the problem [ fabre ] examined while concealing key prior_art disclosing the solution he chose'
id.at 353

finally in addressing fabres excuse that he withheld the vidal_reference because the etoposide-type_experiments he and his co-inventors performed were failures the court found that fabres testimony was not credible
the court determined that during fabres direct examination he did not address all of the etoposide-type_experiments that he and his colleagues had undertaken but rather only reviewed those experiments that demonstrated low stability and thus supported fabres excuse for not disclosing the reference
the remaining experiments *1336 discussed during fabres cross-examination however displayed stabilities ranging from five hours and forty minutes to over thirty hours
id.at 352-53 ; j.a

fabre attempted to downplay the significance of these experiments by stating that they were not` etoposide-type formulations'
but the district_court found that fabres testimony was contrary to the titles of the sanofi documents detailing those experiments and lacked credibility` the court does not find credible fabres witness-stand assertion twenty years after the documents were prepared that the contemporaneous description of these formulations asetoposide-type did not reflect how sanofis researchers actually viewed the formulations'
aventis 743 f.supp.2d at 353
based on the evidence and his assessment of fabres testimony the court found that fabre` knew that the vidal_reference and the other etoposide prior_art were relevant to the patentability of his alleged invention but nonetheless chose not to disclose it to the patent office'
id
from this finding the court concluded that fabre acted with the intent to deceive the pto when he withheld the vidal_reference
id

in light of the evidence before the district_court supporting the finding of a specific_intent to deceive coupled with the deference we must afford to the district_courts credibility_determinations we can not conclude that the courts finding that fabre withheld the vidal_reference with the specific_intent to deceive the pto was clearly erroneous

we reach the same conclusion with respect to the gv_reference
the gv_reference describes the relationship between the structure and activity of various analogues of paclitaxel including docetaxel and names one of fabres colleagues as an author
specifically relevant to the patentability of the patents at issue the reference states` moreover taxotere 13a showed a better solubility in excipient system polysorbate 80/ethanol 1:1..' j.a
5631
fabre testified that he did not cite the gv_reference to the pto because he only read a march 1990 draft of the reference which did not include this sentence disclosing the polysorbate 80/docetaxel formulation

again the district_court found that this testimony was not credible and relied on the other_evidence presented during the trial in finding that fabre withheld the reference with the specific_intent to deceive the pto
the court explained that fabre was the project leader of sanofis taxotere development had to approve the gv_reference for publication and had testified that he reviewed the article` with some care to make sure that it was a proper article for the company to be publishing'
id.at 353-54
the court further highlighted fabres testimony that in march 1992 he was dissatisfied with the clinical brochure for taxotere because it did not list the gv_reference and affirmatively took steps to ensure that the reference was identified
six months later however when fabre signed his patent_declaration he failed to disclose the reference to the pto
id.at 353
relying on this evidence the district_court found that fabre`reviewed.. with some care the final version of the gv_reference prior to signing the patent_declaration was aware of the references materiality to the prosecution of his patents and purposefully decided not to disclose it despite this knowledge'
id.at 354
thus contrary to sanofis contention in concluding that fabre acted with a specific_intent to deceive the pto the district_court did not rely solely on its finding that fabre was not credible but instead viewed fabres testimony in light of the other_evidence to reach its intent conclusion
based on the *1337 evidence presented this finding was not clearly erroneous

relying on these materiality and intent_findings the district_court found the patents were unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct
id.at 354
based on the district_courts thorough discussion of its factual_findings and its well-reasoned analysis that is consistent with therasense this determination was not an abuse of discretion
we accordingly affirm

iii
conclusion
we have considered sanofis additional arguments for reversing the district_courts decision and conclude that they similarly lack merit
consequently for the reasons set forth above the district_courts judgment that claim 5 of the ¡¬561_patent and claim 7 of the ¡¬512_patent are invalid for obviousness and that the ¡¬561 and ¡¬512_patent s are unenforceable for inequitable_conduct is affirmed

affirmed
