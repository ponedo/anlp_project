discussion
the field of invention is hand-operated controllers for the movement of images on a computer_screen or television_display particularly as used in video_games
the controller is the tool by which human hands manipulate a graphic image a procedure called` hand_inputs'
the hand_inputs are implemented through handles such as joysticks or trackballs whereby the hand actions of the human operator are sensed and translated electronically into corresponding linear and rotational_movements that are shown in graphic display
as discussed in the patents in suit hand_inputs move images in six general directions that are called` degrees of freedom' dof in the lexicon of this technology
thus the hand_inputs may produce linear_movement along three axes forward/backward left/right or up/down and rotational_movement about the three linear_axes roll pitch or yaw

the ¡¬700_patent was filed on november 16 2000 as a continuation-in-part of the application that became u.s._patent 6,222,525 the ¡¬525_patent
the validity of the ¡¬700_patent_claims in suit depends on whether these claims as construed by the district_court are entitled to the filing_date of the ¡¬ 525 patent july_5,_1996
see 35 u.s.c.¡± 120` an application for patent for an invention disclosed in the manner provided by the first_paragraph of section 112 of this title in an application previously filed in the united_states.. shall have *1335 the same effect as to such invention as though filed on the date of the prior application..'
in reiffin v. microsoft_corp. 214_f.3d_1342 1345-46 fed.cir.2000 the court explained the need` to ensure that the scope of the right to exclude as set forth in the claims does not overreach the scope of the inventors contribution to the field of art as described in the patent specification'
this rationale applies to a specification whose filing_date is needed to antedate prior_art
see moba b.v. v. diamond automation inc. 325_f.3d_1306 1319-20 fed.cir.2003 ; ralston purina co. v. far-mar-co inc. 772_f.2d_1570 1575 fed.cir.1985
anascape has conceded that if not so entitled the ¡¬700_patent_claims are subject to invalidation based on the intervening prior_art of a sony` dualshock' controller sold in the united_states in 1998 and described in a patent_application of goto published in 1998 and a sony` dualshock 2' controller sold in the united_states in october 2000
anascapes response to this prior_art is that the ¡¬700_patent_claims are entitled to the july_5,_1996 filing_date
the district_court so found ; this is the principal issue on this appeal

i
to obtain the benefit of the filing_date of a parent_application the claims of the later-filed application must be supported by the written description in the parent` in sufficient detail that one skilled in the art can clearly conclude that the inventor invented the claimed invention as of the filing_date sought'
lockwood v. american airlines inc. 107_f.3d_1565 1572 fed.cir.1997
see generally ariad pharmaceuticals inc. v. eli_lilly & co. no._2008-1248 2010_wl_1007369_(fed.cir._mar.22,_2010)
the issue turns on whether the specification of the ¡¬525_patent supports not only controllers having a single_input_member that operates in six degrees of freedom as described and claimed in the ¡¬525_patent but also controllers having multiple_input_members that together operate in six degrees of freedom as described and claimed in the ¡¬700_patent

the district_court observed in its claim_construction ruling that in the ¡¬ 525 patent` [ t ] he patentee clearly expected the inventions to be used with a single_input_member such as a joystick that moved in 6 dof to control an image appearing to move in three dimensions'
anascape 2008_wl_160546 at *4
we agree that the ¡¬525_specification describes controllers having a single_input_member that is operable in six degrees of freedom
as originally filed all of the claims of the ¡¬525_patent recited such a single_input_member

anascape argued for the purpose of establishing the ¡¬525_filing_date for the ¡¬700_claims that the ¡¬525_specification also supports the ¡¬700_claims that are not limited to a single_input_member operable in six degrees of freedom
nintendo disputed that position arguing that the ¡¬525_specification is directed to only a single_input_member
many passages in the ¡¬525_specification are to this effect
for example the` background of the invention' states in the prior_art there exist 6 dof_controllers of a type having a hand operable single_input_member moveable in six degrees of freedom for axes control relative to a reference_member of the controller
this type of controller having the 6 dof operable input_member outputs a signal s for each degree of freedom input and it is this type of 6 dof_controller which is believed to be by far the most easily used for 3-d graphics control and it is with this type of 6 dof_controller that the present invention is primarily concerned
¡¬525_patent col.1 l.61-col.2 l.2
the` summary of the invention' section of the ¡¬525_specification states *1336 the controllers provide structuring for converting full six degrees of freedom physical input provided by a human hand on a hand_operable_single_input_member into representative outputs or signals useful either directly or indirectly for controlling or assisting in controlling graphic image displays
id
col.4 ii.50-55
the specification also states a primary_object of the invention is to provide a 6dof image_controller physical-to-electrical converter which includes a single_input_member being hand_operable_relative to a reference_member of the controller.. id
col.7 ii.50-54 ; id
col.7 ii.59-62 6dof_controller` includes a single_input_member being hand_operable_relative to a reference_member of the controller'
the abstract states that the invention concerns` multiple-axes controllers comprised of a single_input_member operable in 6 dof relative to a reference_member'
see also id
col.5 ii.8-9` the input_member accepts 6 dof of hand_input relative to the reference_member' ; id
col.8 l.4` 6 dof_controller which includes a single_input_member' ; id
col.8 l.12` single_input_member' ; id
col.8 l.19` single_input_member'

similarly the drawings all show a single_input_member in the form of a trackball or a joystick capable of operating in six degrees of freedom
id
col.7_ii.47-49` a 6dof trackball-type_embodiment is illustrated in figs
1-10 and 6dof joystick type_embodiments are illustrated in figs
13-36
``

anascape argues that figures 1-6 of the ¡¬525_patent describe multiple_input_members operating in fewer than six degrees of freedom
this statement does not match the description in the patent
figures 1-4 are described as a` trackball-type_embodiment' of the hand operable 6dof_controller in which trackball 12 is` the hand_operable_single_input_member operable in full six degrees of freedom'
id
col. 11 ii.19-25
several figures show a rotatable_collet surrounding the trackball and the specification states that the collet provides the user with` the option of rotating about yaw via the trackball or the rotatable_collet'
id
col. 17 ii.18-19
the specification also states that the collet` does not bar' the control of yaw by the trackball which is capable of operating in six degrees of freedom
see id
col.17_ii.14-19` when a rotatable_collet is used a sensor is used to detect rotation of collet 16 as described above but this does not bar still having a sensor encoder in communication with trackball 12 for detecting rotation of the trackball about the yaw axis and this would give the user the option of rotating about yaw via the trackball or the rotatable_collet`
the specification does not state that the collet replaces any of the six degrees of freedom of the trackball

in figure 20 the controller includes a handle as well as signal input elements in the form of buttons
the inventor testified that the handle of figure 20 operates as a single_input_member movable in six degrees of freedom
the inventor testified that the embodiments of figures 4_and_6 which depict a trackball/collet combination and figure 9 which depicts a handle/button combination all include a single_input_member operable in six degrees of freedom

nintendo counts over twenty explicit statements that the invention is directed to a single_input_member that is operable in six degrees of freedom
the ¡¬525_specification does not describe a controller with input_members limited to fewer than six degrees of freedom
anascape points to a sentence in the ¡¬ 525 patent which states that` [ t ] he input_member of the joystick-type controller may be manipulatable or operable in up to 6 dof'
id
col.7 ii.40-42
however this is not a description of *1337 the ¡¬525_invention ; it is a description of prior_art joysticks as generally used in video_games
the ¡¬525_specification consistently describes the joystick in the drawings as a` 6dof joystick type_embodiment'
id
col.7_ii.47-49

the ¡¬525_patent stresses the advantages of using a single_input_member operable in six degrees of freedom and describes the use of multiple_input_members as having` significant disadvantages' discussing prior_art u.s._patent 5,298,919 to chang [ i ] n changs controller the lack of a hand_operable_single_input_member operable in six degrees of freedom has many significant disadvantages
further the chang_controller does not have a any [ sic ] input_member capable of being manipulated in 6 dof relative to any reference_member of the controller which yields additional significant disadvantages
* * * * the chang_controller does not have a single_input_member such as one ball or one handle which can be operated causing representative electrical output in six degrees of freedom
nor can any one chang input_member be manipulated moved relative to a reference_member on the controller in six degrees of freedom
thus the chang device is functionally and structurally deficient
¡¬525_patent col.3 l.30-col.4 l.30

for a parent_application to provide the filing_date for claims of a continuing application the description in the parent must meet the requirements of 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 first_paragraph as to that claimed subject_matter
tronzo v. biomet inc. 156_f.3d_1154 1158 fed.cir.1998 ; see also e.g. fiers v. revel 984_f.2d_1164 1169-70 fed.cir.1993 entitlement to the benefit of an earlier-filed application date requires that the earlier_application meets the requirements of ¡± 112
anascape points to some of the issued claims of the ¡¬525_patent which recite an` input_member moveable on at least two axes' and argues that this adequately describes for priority purposes use of more than a single_input_member in order to obtain movement in six degrees of freedom
we need not decide the significance of the words` at least two' for as nintendo points out this text was not part of the specification and claims as filed in 1996 but was added to the claims by amendment in august 2000
see poweroasis inc. v. t-mobile usa inc. 522_f.3d_1299 1306 fed.cir.2008` [ t ] o satisfy the written description_requirementthe missing descriptive matter must necessarily be present in the [ original ] applications specification such that one skilled in the art would recognize such a disclosure
`` quoting tronzo 156 f.3d at 1159 alteration in original
this text was not present in the original ¡¬525_specification and can not contribute written description support for the ¡¬700_claims as of the ¡¬ 525 filing_date

claim 19 of the ¡¬700_patent is representative of the claims that were asserted against the nintendo game products 19
a hand operated controller comprising structure allowing hand_inputs rotating a platform on two mutually perpendicular_axes to be translated into electrical outputs by four unidirectional sensors to allow controlling objects and navigating a viewpoint the controller including a tactile feedback means for providing vibration detectable by the user through the hand operating the controller ; a second element movable on two mutually perpendicular_axes said second element structured to activate two bi-directional_proportional_sensors providing outputs at least in part controlling objects and navigating a viewpoint ; a third element movable on two mutually perpendicular_axes said third element *1338 structured to activate two bi-directional_proportional_sensors providing outputs at least in part controlling objects and navigating a viewpoint ; a plurality of independent finger depressible buttons each button associated with a button sensor said button sensor outputs at least on/off data to allow controlling of the objects
the specification of the ¡¬700_patent describes controllers that are not limited to a single_input_member capable of movement in six degrees of freedom
in filing the application that became the ¡¬700_patent several changes were made in the ¡¬525_specification.2 nintendo points to the areas in which the applicant changed the text that had limited the controller to a single_input_member operable in six degrees of freedom
in the` background of the invention' and` summary of the invention' sections every occurrence of` hand_operable_single_input_member' in the ¡¬525_specification was replaced with` hand_operable_input_member s' e.g. ¡¬700_patent col.2 ii.22 or` at least one hand_operable_input_member' e.g. id
col.2 ii.37-38

at column 4 lines 47-49 the ¡¬525_specification states` i have developed improved low-cost hand operated 6dof_controllers..' as changed the ¡¬700_specification states at column 2 lines 14-20` i have developed improved low cost hand operated controllers providing up to 6 degrees of freedom in preferred_embodiments.. while not restricted or required to be full six degrees of freedom..' at column 5 lines 1-8 the ¡¬525_patent states that` the hand_operable_input_member.. accepts 6dof of hand_input'
this is changed in the ¡¬700_patent at column 2 lines 37-44 to` at least one hand_operable_input_member [ in which ].. the input_member s accept 3d of hand_input'
again at column 7 lines 50-53 the ¡¬525_patent states` a primary_object of the invention is to provide a 6dof image_controller.. which includes a single_input_member being hand operable..' as changed the ¡¬700_patent at column 4 lines 34-37 states` a primary_object of the invention is to provide a 3d image_controller.. which includes at least one input_member being hand operable..' nintendo points out that the applicant changed sixteen of the seventeen references to a` single_input_member' to reference` at least one input_member'
e.g. ¡¬700_patent col.4 ii.56 64 ; id
col.5 l.6
the ¡¬ 700 specification also deleted all mention of the prior_art chang_controller and its deficiencies

anascape states that these changes in the ¡¬700_specification and claims are not` new matter'
that position is untenable for the changes are extensive and substantive
a description can be broadened by removing limitations
the limitation to a single_input_member capable of movement in six degrees of freedom was removed in filing the ¡¬700 application and new claims were provided of commensurately broadened scope
this is classical new matter
see e.g. baldwin graphic systems inc. v. siebert inc. 512_f.3d_1338 1344 fed.cir.2008` the examiner rightly refused to allow the applicants to amend the specification to remove references toheat as the way of sealing the sleeve' for the change` would have broadened the patent and introduced impermissible new matter' and rendered the reissue claims` invalid for lack of support in the initial disclosure'

anascape argues that the subject_matter described in the ¡¬525_specification simply is the preferred_embodiment and that the inventor did not disclaim the broader *1339 scope of the ¡¬700_claims
the district_court observed that` nothing in the [525 ] specification disclaims other variations'
anascape 2008_wl_160546 at *6
however the question is not whether the patentee in the ¡¬525_specification` disclaimed' the scope of the ¡¬ 700 patent ; the question is whether the ¡¬525_specification sufficiently describes the later-claimed subject_matter as to entitle the ¡¬700_claims to the filing_date of the ¡¬525_application
see lucent technologies inc. v. gateway inc. 543_f.3d_710 718-19 fed.cir.2008 to claim priority based on the filing_date of an earlier_application the earlier_application must support the claims of the later-filed application

a patentee is not deemed to disclaim every variant that it does not mention
however neither is a patentee presumed to support variants that are not described
see amgen inc. v. hoechst marion roussel inc. 314_f.3d_1313 1330 fed.cir.2003` the purpose of the written description_requirement is to prevent an applicant from later asserting that he invented that which he did not ; the applicant for a patent is therefore required torecount his invention in such detail that his future claims can be determined to be encompassed within his original creation
`` quoting vas-cath inc. v. mahurkar 935_f.2d_1555 1561 fed.cir.1991
each case must be viewed as it would be understood by a person of ordinary skill in the field of the invention

anascape argues that the testimony of its expert witness dr. robert howe established its position that the ¡¬525_specification adequately described the subject_matter of the ¡¬700_claims at least sufficiently to support the jury verdict
dr._howe testified that` the [525 ] patent is simply not limited to single_input 6-degree-of-freedom_controllers ; and the claims which do not concern those are-find support in both the 1996 application and the ¡¬700_patent'
j.a
4685
however dr._howes conclusion is not supported by any evidence at all and can not override the objective content of these documents
see poweroasis 522 f.3d at 1307-08 in determining the relationship between a later-claimed invention and an earlier_application it is helpful to consider the changes made in the later application

anascape also refers to the testimony of a nintendo engineer mr. kazunori koshiishi concerning figure 2 of the ¡¬525_patent
anascape states that mr._koshiishi testified that a trackball-type_embodiment in the ¡¬525_patent shows a combination of a 3dof trackball and a 3dof collet as opposed to a single_input_member that is operable in six degrees of freedom
nintendo points out that this is a misstatement of mr._koshiishis testimony
he responded to questioning about hypothetical_modifications of the trackball-type_embodiment such as controllers where either the trackball or collet called a` cup' during questioning is removed ; for example q
if you removed the cup from the controller depicted in figure 2 you would not be able to sense movement on three linear_axes ; is that correct ?
a
no you would n't
q
but if you still had the trackball you would still have a 3-degree-of-freedom_controller because you could still sense rotational_movement on three axes ; is that correct ?
a
yes
q
so if you remove the cup instead of six separate outputs being sent to the cpu there would only be three outputs sent to the cpu one representing each axis of rotational_movement of the trackball ; is that correct ?
a
yes
q
now conversely if you did not remove the cup but you did remove the trackball then you would still have a 3- *1340 degree-of-freedom_controller except it would be able to measure linear_movement on three axes and not rotational_movement on three axes ; is that correct ?
a
yes
j.a
4532-33
this testimony on hypothetical_modifications to the embodiment hypothetically separates the functions of the collet from the functions of the trackball and is inconsistent with the disclosure of the specification which states that the` trackball.. is the hand_operable_single_input_member operable in full six degrees of freedom'
¡¬525_patent col.11 ii.23-25
indeed the specification explicitly contemplates a version of the embodiment without a collet` if a graspable collet is not used then the exposed portion of trackball 12 is available for grasping with the fingers to apply force in any linear direction..' id
col.12 ii.54-56
thus the trackball is capable of operating in six degrees of freedom regardless of the presence of the collet

similarly anascape argues that the embodiment shown in figures 5_and_6 of the ¡¬525_patent discloses multiple inputs that together operate in six degrees of freedom
this embodiment is substantially similar to the trackball-type_embodiment of figures 1_though_4 except that the collet is given the ability to rotate in order to control yaw motion
this difference however is immaterial as the collet is merely a secondary means of yaw control
the trackball retains the ability to operate in all six degrees of freedom` when a rotatable_collet is used.. the trackball 12 input_member may be interpretable on all six axes as previously described..' id
col.17_ii.14-21

thus the description in the ¡¬525_specification is not reasonably read as describing a larger invention of which the single_input was only a preferred_embodiment
see honeywell int l inc. v. itt industries inc. 452_f.3d_1312 1318 fed.cir.2006` here the written description uses language that leads us to the conclusion that a fuel_filter is the onlyfuel injection system component that the claims cover and that a fuel_filter was not merely discussed as a preferred_embodiment`
whether or not the inventor could have described the ¡¬525_invention more broadly` [ i ] t is not sufficient for purposes of the written description_requirement of ¡± 112 that the disclosure when combined with the knowledge in the art would lead one to speculate as to modifications that the inventor might have envisioned but failed to disclose'
lockwood 107 f.3d at 1572

we conclude that the only reasonable reading of the ¡¬525_specification is that it is directed to and describes only a controller having a single_input_member operable in six degrees of freedom
in contrast the ¡¬700_specification and claims were enlarged to cover more than single_input_members operable in six degrees of freedom
the district_court erred in ruling that this subject_matter is adequately described in the ¡¬525_specification for the statutory requirements are not met on any reading of the ¡¬525_specification

ii
the district_court construed the ¡¬700_claims as not limited to a controller with a single_input_member capable of moving in six degrees of freedom
this construction is necessary to the jurys verdict of infringement for the accused nintendo controllers do not have a single_input_member that moves in six degrees of freedom.3 we conclude that the district_court correctly construed the claims of the ¡¬ *1341 700 patent in light of the ¡¬700_specification
however as we have discussed the district_court erred in its ruling that as construed the broadened scope of the ¡¬700_claims is entitled to the filing_date of the ¡¬525_patent

the jury found that the ¡¬700_claims are not invalid on the ground of anticipation or obviousness or written description_requirements
these verdicts all require that the ¡¬700_claims are entitled to the filing_date of the ¡¬525_patent for anascape has agreed that if not so entitled the claims are invalid
we conclude that the district_court erred in finding that the ¡¬ 525 specification contains descriptive text sufficient to support the ¡¬700_claims as construed that is claims that include multiple_input_members that do not operate in six degrees of freedom
although the jury found by special verdict that the ¡¬700_claims are not invalid on written description grounds the jury verdict form asked whether` the ¡¬700_patent fails to satisfy the written description_requirement' not whether the ¡¬525_patent satisfies the written description_requirement for the ¡¬700_claims

since the ¡¬700_claims are not entitled to the ¡¬525_filing_date of july_5,_1996 the judgments of validity and infringement can not stand for anascape conceded that the sony prior_art anticipates the ¡¬700_claims if not so entitled
thus judgment as a matter of law is appropriate for` areasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue

gajarsa circuit_judge concurring
while i agree with the majoritys result i write separately to highlight the majoritys best use of the written description_requirement as a priority-policing mechanism in contradistinction to an independent basis for invalidity
in this case anascape filed the ¡¬700_patent as a continuation-in-part of the ¡¬525_patents application
pursuant to 35 u.s.c.¡± 120 anascapes ¡¬700_patent would be entitled to the ¡¬525_patents priority_date only if the ¡¬525_patents written description disclosed the subject_matter of the later-filed ¡¬700_patent
see in re smith 59_c.c.p.a._1025 458_f.2d_1389 1394 1972
because as the majority correctly concludes the ¡¬700_patent_claims subject_matter not disclosed by the ¡¬ 525 patent the ¡¬700_patent is not entitled to the ¡¬525_patents priority_date
in this case the failure to establish the earlier priority_date is fatal as anascape conceded that a prior_art sony product anticipated the asserted claims

the majoritys application of the written description_requirement in my judgment would be the preferred use of the written description_requirement
as this courts predecessor stated satisfaction of the description_requirement insures that subject_matter presented in the form of a claim subsequent to the filing_date of the application was sufficiently disclosed at the time of filing so that the prima facie date of invention can fairly be held to be the filing_date of the application
this concept applies whether the case factually arises out of an assertion of entitlement to the filing_date of a previously filed application under ¡± 120.. or arises in the interference context wherein the issue is support for a count in the specification of one or more of the parties.. or arises in an ex parte case involving a single application but where the claim at issue was filed subsequent to the filing of the application.. *1342 in re smith and hubin 481_f.2d_910 914 ccpa 1973 ; see also in re wright 866_f.2d_422 424 fed.cir.1989` when the scope of a claim has been changed by amendment in such a way as to justify an assertion that it is directed to a different invention than was the original claim it is proper to inquire whether the newly claimed subject_matter was described in the patent_application when filed as the invention of the applicant
that is the essence of the so-calleddescription_requirement of ¡± 112 first_paragraph
``

this court however has held en banc that ¡± 112 first_paragraph provides for a written description_requirement capable of invalidating claims ariad pharm. inc. v. eli_lilly & co. 598_f.3d_1336_(fed.cir.2010) though i continue to believe that` [ c ] onfining written description to the priority context would provide greater clarity to district_courts and practitioners both of whom are currently left to trudge through a thicket of written description jurisprudence that provides no conclusive answers and encourages a shotgun approach to litigation' id.at 1361 gajarsa j. concurring
while the statutory language has been interpreted by this court to require a written description for patentability it is not the ideal vehicle for invalidating claims
such a vehicle is better provided by the enablement_requirement of ¡± 112
under this courts current law enablement provides the preferred vehicle for invalidating claims that extend beyond what the patent actually discloses to a person of skill in the art
see martek biosciences corp. v. nutrinova inc. 579_f.3d_1363 1378 fed.cir.2009` to meet the enablement_requirement the specification of a patent must teach those skilled in the art how to make and use the full scope of the claimed invention without undue experimentation'

moreover clearly defining the separate contexts in which written description and enablement are applicable would provide some justification for this courts currently inexplicable treatment of written description as a question of fact yet enablement as a question of law

while ariad conclusively established that ¡± 112 first_paragraph requires both an enabling disclosure and a written description it left to the district_courts and practitioners the task of resolving many questions concerning how ariad applies in practice

here the majoritys opinion demonstrates a good example in applying the written description in a priority_policing_context while leaving invalidity in the capable hands of the enablement doctrine
though ariad makes clear that written description is not confined to the priority_policing_context i continue to believe such confinement while not statutorily mandated streamlines litigation and arguably reconciles some of our written description and enablement precedent
