lourie circuit_judge
duramed_pharmaceuticals inc.` duramed' appeals from the decision of the united_states_district_court for the southern_district of new_york granting summary_judgment of noninfringement to paddock_laboratories inc.` paddock'
duramed pharms. inc. v. paddock_labs. inc. 715_f.supp.2d_552 s.d.n.y.2010
because the district_court did not err in holding that prosecution_history_estoppel bars durameds allegations of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents we affirm

background
duramed owns u.s._patent 5,908,638` ¡¬638_patent` which claims conjugated estrogen pharmaceutical_compositions for use in hormone replacement therapies
the claimed conjugated estrogens are extremely water sensitive and thus highly susceptible to moisture degradation during storage
see ¡¬638_patent col.6 ll.46-56
accordingly duramed developed a formulation for conjugated estrogens that includes a moisture_barrier_coating` mbc' to inhibit the absorption of moisture and reduce storage-related degradation
see id
col.6 ll.36-45

duramed filed a patent application on its formulation on july_26,_1995
original independent claim 1 recited a conjugated estrogen pharmaceutical_composition` coated with a moisture_barrier_coating'
j.a
254
original dependent claim 7 limited` said moisture_barrier_coating' to one that` comprises ethylcellulose'
j.a
255
the examiner rejected both claims as obvious but during an interview advised that he would allow the application if duramed amended claim 1 to include inter_alia the limitations of claim 7
in a response received december 3 1998 duramed amended claim 1 to recite pharmaceutical_compositions with` a moisture_barrier_coating_comprising_ethylcellulose'
j.a
304
claim 1 of the issued ¡¬638_patent the patents only independent claim accordingly reads as follows 1
a pharmaceutical_composition in a solid unit dosage form capable of oral administration for the hormonal treatment of peri-menopausal menopausal and post-menopausal disorders in a woman comprising conjugated estrogens coated onto one or more organic_excipients forming a powdered conjugated estrogen composition where said composition is substantially free of inorganic_excipients and further comprises about 30-70 % gel-forming organic_excipient and about 30-70 % non-gel forming organic_excipient by weight and having less than about 2.5 % free water by weight and greater than 2.5 % total water wherein said solid unit dosage form is coated with a moisture_barrier_coating_comprising_ethylcellulose
¡¬638_patent claim 1 emphasis added

in march 2009 duramed filed suit against paddock under 35 u.s.c.¡± 271 e 2 alleging infringement of the ¡¬638_patent based on paddocks abbreviated new drug application` anda' for a generic_version of durameds hormone replacement therapy product cenestinthe_r
duramed alleged infringement of claims 1 4 and 6-8 under the doctrine of equivalents because paddocks proposed generic_product uses a polyvinyl_alcohol` pva' mbc marketed as opadry_amb
paddock moved for summary_judgment of noninfringement arguing that duramed was barred by amendment-based prosecution_history_estoppel from alleging that pva *1379 met the` moisture_barrier_coating_comprising_ethylcellulose' limitation of the asserted claims

in its motion for summary_judgment paddock relied on several pre-amendment references including an international_patent_application filed by colorcon pursuant to the patent cooperation treaty` the colorcon_pct'
the colorcon_pct published on january 25 1996 discloses formulations of pva-based mbcs including opadry_amb but also in a section entitled` description of the prior_art' notes several technical_drawbacks of using pva as an mbc
paddock also relied on 1 u.s._patent 3,935,326` the groppenbacher_patent' which issued in 1976 and discloses the use of pva in moisture-tight tablets ; 2 an article in the december 1995 issue of` manufacturing_chemist' that tests pva_mbcs and concludes that opadry_amb is a highly effective_moisture_barrier_formulation ; 3 three scientific articles on pva_mbcs authored for distribution at scientific conferences in may 1995 may 1998 and november 1998 ; and 4 invoices indicating sales of opadry_amb by colorcon before september 1996

the district_court granted paddocks motion for summary_judgment of noninfringement holding that prosecution_history_estoppel barred durameds infringement allegations
duramed 715 f.supp.2d at 555-56
the district_court first held that durameds amendment adding the ethylcellulose limitation was substantially related to patentability and narrowed the scope of the asserted claims thus triggering the presumption under festo_corp. v. shoketsu_kinzoku_kogyo_kabushiki_co. 344_f.3d_1359 1366-67 fed.cir.2003 en banc` festo_ix` that duramed had surrendered all territory between the original and amended claim_scope
duramed 715 f.supp.2d at 559-60

the district_court then held that duramed had failed to rebut the festo presumption based on an argument of inter_alia the unforeseeability of the use of pva as an mbc in a pharmaceutical formulation
id.at 560
rather the court held that pva_mbcs were foreseeable at the time of durameds narrowing amendment based on the colorcon_pcts description of pva as` a moisture_barrier_coating for pharmaceutical_tablets and the like' and its disclosure of the opadry_amb formulation used in paddocks proposed generic_product
id.at 560-61
the court noted that several other facts reinforced this decision 1 the pre-september 1996 invoices for the sale of opadry_amb ; and 2 the groppenbacher_patent which teaches coating tablets with pva to ensure`moisture tight [ ness ] andinsolub [ ility ] in the gastrointestinal tract
`` 1 id.at 561-62
finally the court rejected durameds argument that the colorcon_pcts disclosure of pva_mbcs technical_drawbacks raised serious questions about pvas effectiveness as an mbc concluding that` even if the effectiveness of pva was unknown in 1998 that would not mean that pva_mbcs were unforeseeable'
id.at 563

duramed timely appealed to this court
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

discussion
we review a district_courts grant of summary_judgment de novo reapplying the same standard applied by the district *1380 court
iovate health scis. inc. v. bio-engineered supplements & nutrition inc. 586_f.3d_1376 1380 fed.cir.2009
summary judgment is appropriate if there are no genuine issues of material_fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law
fed.r.civ.p
56 c

under the doctrine of the equivalents` a product or process that does not literally infringe.. the express terms of a patent claim may nonetheless be found to infringe if there isequivalence between the elements of the accused product or process and the claimed elements of the patented invention'
warner-jenkinson co. v. hilton davis chem co. 520_u.s._17 21 117_s.ct._1040 137_l.ed.2d_146_(1997) citing graver tank & mfg co. v. linde air prods co. 339_u.s._605 609 70_s.ct._854 94_l.ed._1097_(1950)
however the doctrine of prosecution_history_estoppel prevents a patent owner from recapturing through the doctrine of equivalents subject matter surrendered to acquire the patent
see festo_corp. v. shoketsu_kinzoku_kogyo_kabushiki_co. 535_u.s._722 734 122_s.ct._1831 152_l.ed.2d_944_(2002)` festo_viii`

because during prosecution duramed narrowed the scope of the ¡¬638_patents claims in response to a prior art rejection a presumption of prosecution_history_estoppel applies
see festo_ix 344 f.3d at 1366-67
nonetheless duramed may rebut that presumption by showing inter_alia the` alleged equivalent would have beenunforeseeable at the time of the amendment and thus beyond a fair interpretation of what was surrendered
`` id.at 1369 quoting festo_viii 535 u.s. at 738 122_s.ct._1831
`` [ a ] n alternative is foreseeable if it is disclosed in the pertinent prior art in the field of the invention
in other words an alternative is foreseeable if it is known in the field of the invention as reflected in the claim_scope before amendment'
festo_corp. v. shoketsu_kinzoku_kogyo_kabushiki_co. 493_f.3d_1368 1379 fed.cir.2007` festo_x`
foreseeability is a question of law based on underlying issues of fact
id.at 1375

on appeal duramed argues that the district_court applied the wrong legal test for foreseeability and thus held that any mention of an alleged equivalent in the prior art makes that equivalent foreseeable as a matter of law
but according to duramed an equivalent is not foreseeable if it was not understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to be suitable for use in the invention as originally claimed
and in this case duramed asserts the relevant art did not disclose either pva or opadry_amb as suitable mbcs for moisture-sensitive pharmaceutical_compounds like conjugated estrogens

paddock responds that the district_court applied the correct foreseeability standard which requires only that pva be foreseeable as an mbc for pharmaceutical_applications at the time of durameds narrowing amendment
in this case according to paddock the colorcon_pct alone renders pva_mbcs foreseeable but this conclusion is bolstered by colorcons commercialization of opadry_amb the groppenbacher_patent and the other references not considered by the district_court

we agree with paddock that duramed failed to rebut the presumption of prosecution_history_estoppel based on unforeseeability
we first note that to the extent that duramed argues that foreseeability requires that pva must have been known as an mbc for use with conjugated estrogens we have previously rejected such a restrictive definition of the field of invention
see schwarz pharma inc. v. paddock_labs. inc. 504_f.3d_1371 1377 fed.cir.2007
as we spelled out in schwarz when the language of both original and issued claims begins with the *1381 words` [ a ] pharmaceutical_composition' that language defines the field of the invention for purposes of determining foreseeability
id
accordingly pva_mbcs need only to have been known in the field of pharmaceutical_compositions as of the time of durameds narrowing amendment see festo_x 493 f.3d at 1379 which we hold that the colorcon_pct establishes as a matter of law

the colorcon_pct discloses pva_mbcs for use with pharmaceutical_compositions` a dry powder moisture_barrier_coating composition is made to form a moisture_barrier film coating for pharmaceutical_tablets and the like which comprises polyvinyl_alcohol..' j.a
4466
in the` description of the prior_art' the pct states that` [ t ] he use of the polymer polyvinyl_alcohol pva as a moisture_barrier_coating has been previously suggested' but it also notes two drawbacks of pva_mbcs stickiness and plasticizer compatibility
id
specifically the colorcon_pct states [ p ] ractical usage [ of pva ] has been inhibited by the stickiness of grades of the polymer which have a fast enough rate of going into solution in water to make a dispersion to render them economical to use in making the coating
a further problem with the use of pva is in identifying or selecting a plasticizer which does not compromise the moisture_barrier_properties of the final coating
id

the colorcon_pct then in the` summary of the invention' discloses preferred pva grades and identifies a plasticizer that does not compromise pvas properties as a moisture_barrier
the application states that` [ e ] xcellent moisture_barrier_properties are obtained when hot water soluble grades of pva are used in the inventive_coating' and that` [ a ] preferred grade of pva for use in the inventive_coating is a grade in the medium range.. because the step of heating the water of the liquid coating dispersion may not be necessary while still maintaining excellent moisture_barrier_properties in the inventive_coating'
j.a
4468-69
the colorcon_pct next discloses that soya lecithin` surprisingly and unexpectedly acts as a plasticizer by locking moisture in the coating so the coating stays flexible and not brittle' and thus soya lecithin as a plasticizer` does not compromise the moisture_barrier_properties of the overall coating'
j.a
4469
finally the colorcon_pct lists a number of pva mbc formulations including opadry_amb
accordingly the colorcon_pct discloses pva_mbcs including opadry_amb in the field of pharmaceutical_compositions rendering such_pva_mbcs` known in the field of the invention' and thus foreseeable
festo_x 493 f.3d at 1379

duramed argues that the colorcon_pcts disclosure fails to establish that pva-based opadry_amb was suitable as an mbc because it provides only conclusory statements that the inventors had solved the technical_drawbacks of pva_mbcs and lacks any data on the stability of the pharmaceutical_compounds coated with opadry_amb
we disagree ; foreseeability does not require such precise evidence of suitability
see honeywell int l inc. v. hamilton sundstrand corp. 523_f.3d_1304 1312-13 fed.cir.2008
and even if the pct disclosure indicates that pva is less than ideal in some pharmaceutical uses as an mbc it is still disclosed to be useful as such and that renders it foreseeable for purposes of prosecution_history_estoppel
foreseeability does not require flawless perfection to create an estoppel

in rejecting a foreseeability rebuttal in glaxo wellcome inc. v. impax laboratories inc. 356_f.3d_1348_(fed.cir.2004) we held that` the record abundantly disclosed [ the alleged equivalents ] use as a *1382 release_agent at the relevant time' smithkline beecham corp. v. excel pharms. inc. 356_f.3d_1357 1365 fed.cir.2004 describing glaxo 356 f.3d at 1355
our holding relied on statements from several references disclosing the alleged equivalents use as an extended-release_agent in drug formulations ; it did not rely on test data showing the alleged equivalents precise characteristics or suitability as an extended-release_agent and thus did not rely on the type of evidence duramed demands in this case
see glaxo 356 f.3d at 1355
rather the colorcon_pct discloses the use of pva as mbcs in the field of pharmaceutical_compounds prior to december 3 1998 rendering such_pva_mbcs foreseeable at the time of durameds narrowing amendment.2

conclusion
for the foregoing reasons we affirm the district_courts grant of summary_judgment of noninfringement

the district_court did not consider paddocks remaining pre-1998 articles based on durameds claim that a bench_trial would be necessary to determine if the 1995` manufacturing_chemist' article was publicly available in a university library and if the conference articles were actually distributed to the attendees
id.at 561_n._8
the court concluded that these articles were not necessary to establish foreseeability
id
2
although not necessary to our decision we note that the 1995` manufacturing_chemist' article also supports a finding of foreseeability in the case
like the colorcon_pct the` manufacturing_chemist' article discloses pva_mbcs for use in pharmaceutical_applications and it discloses tests on the performance of pva-based coatings with moisture-sensitive drugs
the tests compared pva_mbcs with hydroxypropyl-methylcellulose mbcs coating tablets of aspirin or erythromycin ethylsuccinate stored for twelve weeks under high relative humidity
the data reveal that` the pva formulation gives much superior moisture protection under humid storage conditions'
j.a
4497
the article concludes that` [ t ] he results presented here have shown a highly effective_moisture_barrier_formulation [ based on the water soluble polymer pva designated opadry_amb ] has been developed'
j.a
4498
the district_court did not rely on this article based on durameds claim that a bench_trial would be necessary to determine if the article was publicly available
duramed 715 f.supp.2d at 561_n._8
we disagree that there is a genuine issue of material_fact on the public availability of an article published in a scientific journal three years before durameds amendment
