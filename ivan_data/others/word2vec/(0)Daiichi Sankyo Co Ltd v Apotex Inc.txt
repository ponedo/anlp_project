opinion
archer senior_circuit_judge apotex inc. and apotex_corp. collectively` apotex' appeal the judgment of the united_states_district_court for the district of new_jersey that apotex infringes u.s. pat
no._5401,741` the ¡¬741_patent` and that the ¡¬741_patent is not invalid or unenforceable
daiichi_pharm co. v. apotex inc. 441_f.supp.2d_672 d.n.j.2006` validity determination`
because the invention of the ¡¬741_patent would have been obvious in view of the prior_art we reverse

i
the ¡¬741_patent is drawn to a method for treating bacterial_ear_infections by topically administering the antibiotic_ofloxacin into the ear.big_token__1_claim_1__big_token is representative and states` [ a ] method for treating otopathy *1256 which comprises the topical otic administration of an amount of ofloxacin or a salt thereof effective to treat otopathy in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier to the area affected with otopathy'
¡¬ 741 patent col.6 ll.36-39

apotex filed an abbreviated new drug application` anda' seeking approval to manufacture a generic_ofloxacin_ear_drop including a ?
iv certification that the ¡¬741_patent was invalid and/or not infringed
following receipt of the anda daiichi owner of the ¡¬741_patent sued apotex for infringement
following a markman hearing the district_court construed the claim term` effective to treat' as` efficacious and safe'
based on this construction and following a bench trial the court concluded that the ¡¬741_patent was not invalid
the court also found that daiichi did not intend to deceive the patent and trademark office during prosecution of the ¡¬741_patent
finally because apotex stipulated that the subject matter of its anda fell within the scope of the claims of the ¡¬741_patent the court found that apotex infringed the ¡¬741_patent

apotex appeals and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

ii
obviousness is a question of law based on underlying questions of fact
winner int l royalty corp. v. wang 202_f.3d_1340 1348 fed.cir.2000
thus we review the ultimate determination of obviousness by a district_court de novo and the underlying_factual_inquiries for clear error
id

the underlying_factual_inquiries in an obviousness_analysis include` 1 the scope and content of the prior_art ; 2 the level of ordinary_skill in the prior_art ; 3 the differences between the claimed invention and the prior_art ; and 4 objective evidence of nonobviousness'
in re dembiczak 175_f.3d_994 998 fed.cir.1999
in this case we begin our analysis with the question of the level of ordinary_skill in the prior_art

the district_court concluded that the ordinary person skilled in the art pertaining to the ¡¬741_patent` would have a medical_degree experience treating patients with ear_infections and knowledge of the pharmacology and use of antibiotics
this person would be.. a pediatrician or general_practitioner-those doctors who are often thefirst line of defense in treating ear_infections and who by virtue of their medical training possess basic pharmacological knowledge'
daiichi_pharm co. v. apotex inc. 380_f.supp.2d_478 485 d.n.j.2005` claim construction order`
apotex argues that the district_court clearly erred in this determination and that one having ordinary_skill in the relevant_art is properly defined as` a person engaged in developing new pharmaceuticals formulations and treatment_methods or a specialist in ear_treatments such as an otologist otolaryngologist or otorhinolaryngologist who also has training in pharmaceutical_formulations'

`` factors that may be considered in determining level of ordinary_skill in the art include 1 the educational_level of the inventor ; 2 type of problems encountered in the art ; 3 prior_art solutions to those problems ; 4 rapidity with which innovations are made ; 5 sophistication of the technology ; and 6 educational_level of active workers in the field'
envtl designs ltd. v. union oil co. 713_f.2d_693 696 fed.cir.1983 citing orthopedic equip co. v. all orthopedic appliances inc. 707_f.2d_1376 1381-82 fed.cir.1983
these factors are not exhaustive but are merely a guide to determining the level of ordinary_skill in the art

in making its determination regarding the level of skill in the art the district_court noted that the parties had provided *1257` little more than conclusory arguments concerning this issue in their briefs` as a result the court looked to other decisions involving patents for a method of treating a physical condition for guidance
only one case cited by the district_court is binding on us merck & co. v. teva pharm
usa inc. 347_f.3d_1367_(fed.cir.2003)
the district_court was correct that in that case we affirmed the trial courts conclusion that a person having ordinary_skill in the relevant_art was a person having a medical_degree experience treating patients with osteoporosis and knowledge of the pharmacology and usage of biphosponates-the compounds at issue in merck
however in merck the level of skill in the art was not disputed by the parties
thus we simply accepted the district_courts finding
that clearly is not the case before us
therefore the district_courts reliance on the level of skill in the art stated in merck was improper

the art involved in the ¡¬741_patent is the creation of a compound to treat ear_infections without damaging a patients hearing
the inventors of the ¡¬ 741 patent were specialists in drug and ear_treatments-not general_practitioners or pediatricians
at the time of the invention inventor sato was a university professor specializing in otorhinolaryngology ; inventor handa was a clinical development department manager at daiichi where he was involved with new drug development and clinical trials ; and inventor kitahara was a research scientist at daiichi engaged in the research and development of antibiotics
additionally others working in the same field as the inventors of the ¡¬741_patent were of the same skill level
see daiichi material for [ c ] onference on development at 1 nov._11,_1987 stating that` there are many voices among medical persons concerned with otorhinolaryngology for demanding development of an otic solution making use of [ ofloxacin ]'

further the problem the invention of the ¡¬741_patent was trying to solve was to create a topical antibiotic compound to treat ear_infections otopathy that did not have damage to the ear as a side effect
¡¬741_patent col.1 ll.23-34
indeed most of the written description details the inventors testing ofloxacin on guinea pigs and their findings that ototoxicity did not result from the use of their compound
such animal testing is traditionally outside the realm of a general_practitioner or pediatrician
finally while a general_practitioner or pediatrician could and would prescribe the invention of the ¡¬741_patent to treat ear_infections he would not have the training or knowledge to develop the claimed compound absent some specialty training such as that possessed by the ¡¬741_patents inventors
accordingly the level of ordinary_skill in the art of the ¡¬741_patent is that of a person engaged in developing pharmaceutical_formulations and treatment_methods for the ear or a specialist in ear_treatments such as an otologist otolaryngologist or otorhinolaryngologist who also has training in pharmaceutical_formulations
thus the district_court clearly erred in finding otherwise

we now turn to the question of whether the invention of the ¡¬741_patent would have been obvious to one of ordinary_skill in the art at the time of the invention
the district_courts error in determining the level of ordinary_skill in the art of the ¡¬741_patent tainted its obviousness_analysis
in view of the correct_level of skill in the art and the evidence of record we conclude that as a matter of law the ¡¬741_patent is invalid as obvious

the district_court construed` effective to treat' to include not only efficacy but safety
we need not decide whether safety is a positive limitation because the evidence demonstrates that in view of the correct_level of skill in the art using a topical *1258 formulation of ofloxacin to treat ear_infections was not only obvious but safe

an article published in 1986 taught the successful use of ear drops containing ciprofloxacin to treat middle_ear_infections
horst ganz gyrase inhibitor in local_treatment of middle ear radical cavities chronically infected with problem microorganisms 34_hno_511_(1986) teaching a lack of ototoxicity for ciprofloxacin administered topically` ganz`
this article explained that ciprofloxacin` would definitely have to be suitable for use as eardops' because ciprofloxacin a gyrase_inhibitor was not subject to the drawbacks normally associated with local_treatment of the ear with antibiotics such as ototoxicity
id
the subjects ear_infections were treated locally with a ciprofloxacin solution and` [ i ] n not one case were side_effects of any kind observed'
id.at 512

the district_court dismissed this finding of no side_effects and thus no ototoxicity because the article reported that use of gyrase_inhibitors` should be used only in difficult cases and exclusively by the otologist'
because an otologist was outside the level of ordinary_skill in the art as determined by the district_court the district_court found that the reference did not support apotexs argument that ofloxacin a gyrase_inhibitor like ciprofloxacin was effective and safe to treat bacterial_ear_infections topically.2 as explained above the district_courts determination of the level of ordinary_skill in the art was incorrect ; thus so too was its dismissal of the teaching of the ganz_reference

when testifying as to the relevance of the ganz_reference in 1988 apotexs expert explained that ciprofloxacin is an antibiotic that is in the same family as ofloxacin and thus` [ o ] ne would understand that a very close relative to ciprofloxacin [ sic ] was safe and effective in treatment of middle ear disease otitis media'
trial tr
vol
3 73-big_token__74_nov._3__big_token 2005
when asked specifically what the ganz_reference would teach to one of ordinary_skill in the art with regard to ofloxacin he further opined that` someone of ordinary_skill in the art would be taught that ofloxacin [ sic ] would be very likely equally as effective as ciprofloxacin [ sic ] when used topically to treat middle_ear_infections' and` one would also think it would be highly likely that ofloxacin [ sic ] could be used in the middle ear with safety'
id.at 77
this testimony was based on the ganz_references statement that no side_effects were observed combined with the fact that ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were both from the same drug family gyrase_inhibitors
id.at 77 61
this testimony was not disputed by daiichis expert except on the basis that the ganz_reference did not convey the same teaching to one of lower skill in the art such as a practicing physician

daiichis expert opined that the ganz_reference disclosed` nothing at all' relevant
this opinion was based on the fact that the article was directed at` a highly highly subspecialized physician.. which would be the otologist or the ear doctor' not a primary care physician or general_practitioner
trial tr
vol
7 72-big_token__73_nov._11__big_token 2005
he further explained that the article did not render the invention of the ¡¬741_patent obvious` most importantly because those of ordinary_skill are defined as a population.. of physicians that are completely different than the audience dr. ganz [ the author ] was writing to'
id.at 73-74
thus daiichis evidence as to why this reference did not render the invention of the ¡¬741_patent obvious was based on an *1259 improper determination of the level of skill in the art.3

accordingly the evidence demonstrates that a reasonable jury would have no other choice than to conclude that in view of the ganz_reference it would have been obvious to a person engaged in developing pharmaceutical_formulations and treatment_methods for the ear or to a specialist in ear_treatments who also has training in pharmaceutical_formulations to use ofloxacin in ear drops to topically treat ear_infections.4

iii
because the invention of the ¡¬741_patent would have been obvious to one having ordinary_skill in the art at the time of the invention the judgment of the district_court5 is

reversed

footnotes
1
the ¡¬741_patent has an effective filing date of april_8,_1988
2
presumably this explains why the district_court did not refer to ofloxacins similarity to ciprofloxacin in its opinion
3
daiichis only evidence with respect to this reference that does not rely on the level of skill in the art is its experts conclusory statement that` [ o ] ne can not extrapolate a safety profile for one antibiotic to another'
this unsupported statement can not refute the detailed testimony of apotexs expert
4
claim 4 of the ¡¬741_patent recites a concentration range for the ofloxacin in the compound-' about 0.05 to about 2 % w/v'
one of the prior_art references u.s. patent no._4551,456 teaches the use of ofloxacin in antibiotic compounds where ofloxacin makes up` 0.big_token__03_to_3__big_token % and especially 0.15 % to 0.5 %' of the compound
col.big_token__1_ll._37__big_token -39
thus the range claimed in the ¡¬741_patent falls within the scope of the prior_art
5
because we hold the ¡¬741_patent invalid as obvious we need not reach apotexs arguments that the ¡¬741_patent was anticipated or procured through inequitable conduct
