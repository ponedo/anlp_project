opinion
pauline newman circuit_judge
the novo nordisk companies collectively` novo' appeal the judgment of the united_states_district_court for the southern *1218 district of new_york entered pursuant to jury_verdict that all of the claims of u.s
patents no._5462,535 the ¡¬535_patent and no._5999,323 the ¡¬323_patent are invalid on the ground of obviousness and that u.s. patent no._5984,906 the ¡¬906_patent is invalid based on same-invention double patenting and obviousness
becton_dickinson and company becton conditionally cross-appeals the district_courts denial of its pre-trial motion for summary_judgment on the ground of anticipation
we affirm the district_courts judgment,1 and dismiss the cross-appeal

discussion
the ¡¬535 ¡¬323 and ¡¬906_patent s are directed to a pen-shaped insulin delivery system for use by diabetic patients
the system comprises a pen-shaped syringe having an insulin-containing cartridge and is designed to inject a measured amount of insulin through a needle
the invalidity issues turn on the diameter of the needle
needle diameter is important to insulin_injection_systems for crystallization and other aspects of insulin solutions limit their ability to flow through very narrow needles
conversely the pain associated with injection increases with the size of the needle

the claims of the ¡¬535 and ¡¬323_patent s are specific to injection pens having needles of 30 gauge g-30big_token__2_claim_1__big_token of the ¡¬535_patent is representative

1
an insulin_injection_system comprising a pen shaped syringe comprising a cartridge with insulin and an injection_needle wherein the needle is a g30_needle and the cartridge contains an insulin_type which may freely flow through the g30_needle
the ¡¬906_patent defines the needle as` thinner than g-29' as illustrated in claim 1 1
an insulin system comprising a pen shaped syringe comprising a cartridge with insulin and an injection_needle wherein the needle is thinner than a g-29_needle and the cartridge contains an insulin_type which may freely flow through a needle_thinner than a g-29_needle
the court construed the` thinner than g-29' limitation of the ¡¬906_claims to mean` thinner than 29 gauge but not thinner than 30 gauge'
becton stipulated to infringement if the patents were valid and novo agrees that there is double patenting if the courts construction of the ¡¬906_claims is correct
obviousness-the ¡¬535 and ¡¬323_patent s. the jury concluded that the ¡¬535 and ¡¬323_patent s are invalid on the ground of obviousness in view of several references offered by becton
these references are of two general categories
the first category describes pen-style insulin_injection_systems but either does not state the needle_size or shows needles of 27_and_28 gauge
for example u.s._patent_no._4973,318 the holm patent describes a pen-shaped insulin_injection_system substantially the same as that shown in the novo patents except that it does not state the needle gauge

the second category of references shows 30 gauge_needles for insulin_injection but not in insulin pens
for example *1219 u.s._patent_no._4552,561 the eckenhoff patent shows a 30 gauge_needle in a rotary syringe for insulin_injection and u.s._patent_no._4894,054 the miskinyar patent describes syringes for insulin_injection with needle diameters in the range of 23_to_30 gauge

at the trial there were no significant disputes as to the facts of the scope and content of the prior_art the level of ordinary_skill and the nature of the claimed invention
see graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 17 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545 148_uspq_459 467 1966
the only question argued to the jury was that of motivation to combine the teachings of the references in order to produce the claimed device
novo argues that becton failed to establish a motivation supported by prior_art whereby a person of ordinary_skill in this field would have been motivated to combine the teachings of these references to produce the insulin pen of the ¡¬535 and ¡¬323_patent s

bectons experts dr. snyderman and dr._sherwin testified that it was well known that thinner needles reduced the pain associated with self-administered insulin_injections and that this knowledge provided motivation to reduce the needle_size
novos expert dr. charles testified similarly stating that the` trick' was to get the needle_size down in order to reduce the pain associated with insulin needle injections
novo stresses its evidence of commercial success and copying
although novo points to the absence of documentary evidence of motivation and criticizes the presentation of` conclusory' testimony by bectons witnesses these are matters of weight and credibility

there was substantial_evidence whereby a reasonable_jury could have found that the known pain reduction provided the requisite motivation to narrow the needle
see in re beattie 974_f.2d_1309 1311 24_uspq2d_1040 1041-42 fed.cir.1992 motivation to combine references to achieve the claimed invention is a question of fact
the jury_verdict of obviousness is not vulnerable on this ground

the requested new trial
novo seeks a new_trial based on the district_courts refusal to include a jury_instruction that` obvious to try' is not the correct_legal_standard for determination of obviousness
novo argues that bectons motivation evidence was no more than` obvious to try' testimony citing dr._sherwins testimony so one would try to use the smallest needle because patients have to stick themselves with insulin and-i mean i think good companies are going to try to do their best to reduce patient pain
so it would be obvious to me to try to do that
becton states that there was no prejudicial_error in the district_courts six pages of careful and correct instructions on the law of obviousness
novo had requested the following additional instruction the evidence might indicate to you that what the inventor did was obvious to try
if so this does not indicate the patent is invalid for obviousness
obvious to try is not the standard
or put differently the question is not whether the invention could be made rather the test is whether the invention as a whole would have been obvious to those of ordinary_skill in the inventors field at the time he or she made the invention
the district_court declined to add this text stating that the parties were free to characterize dr._sherwins testimony during the argument` youll interpret dr._sherwins testimony your way whether or not under what i tell them obviousness is'

we do not discern prejudicial_error in the courts decision to leave it to the parties to argue the weight and significance of *1220 this evidence
while` obvious to try' is not a correct obviousness standard there was extensive argument on the issue
we do not discern a` miscarriage of justice' u.s. surgical corp. v. ethicon inc. 103_f.3d_1554 1566 41_uspq2d_1225 1234 fed.cir.1997 in the jury_instructions that were given and in the trial procedure
taken as a whole there was substantial_evidence to support the jury_verdict

prejudicial arguments
novo states that becton presented unduly prejudicial arguments referring during its opening statement to patents as` monopolies' that raise the price to the public
becton also told the jury that patent examiners are prone to error because they are overworked and inexperienced and presented testimony to this effect
novo states that these prejudicial statements require a new_trial
becton responds that novo failed to object to these arguments during the trial did not present neutralizing testimony and did not request a curative instruction from the judge
in addition the district_court instructed the jury that novos patents carried a presumption of validity and that clear and convincing evidence of invalidity was needed to overcome that presumption

inflammatory insinuations and incorrect statements are improper and their presentation to prejudice the jury is not condoned
see e.g. jamesbury corp. v. litton industr
prod. inc. 756_f.2d_1556 1558-59 225_uspq_253 255 fed.cir.1985` [ t ] his court has disapproved of a challengers characterization of a patentee by the termmonopolist which is commonly regarded as pejorative'
the nature and context of prejudicial remarks warrant careful scrutiny
bectons presentation of testimony on the subject of examiner qualifications was in contravention of the district_courts statement that it did not` expect to hear.. about overworked examiners or negligent examiners or anything else'

however on balance we conclude that a new_trial is not warranted in the circumstances that here prevailed for the issues of examiner competence and of` monopoly' were not raised by post-trial motion ; this inaction by novo suggests that in the overall context of the two-week trial these aspects were less inflammatory than novo now maintains
novo failed to object to any of the statements at trial failed to ask for corrective jury_instructions and failed to raise the issue in post-trial motions
although appellate tribunals are not prohibited from taking remedial action when it is apparent that prejudice or unfairness entered the trial and the interest of justice requires` counsel for the defense can not as a rule remain silent interpose no objections and after a verdict has been returned seize for the first time on the point that the comments to the jury were prejudicial'
united states v. socony-vacuum oil co. 310_u.s._150 238-39 60_s.ct._811 84_l.ed._1129_(1940)

viewed overall we conclude that a new_trial is not warranted on the grounds of prejudice

the ¡¬906_patent
novo removed the ¡¬906_patent from the jury trial
the district_court ruled that the ¡¬906_patent is invalid for same-invention type double patenting following the jury_verdict invalidating the ¡¬535 and ¡¬323_patent s. on appeal novo states that the court incorrectly construed the term` thinner than a g-29' needle in the ¡¬906_claims and thus erred in its conclusion
claim 1 is representative 1
an insulin_injection_system comprising a pen shaped syringe comprising a cartridge with insulin and an injection_needle wherein the needle is thinner than a g-29_needle and the cartridge *1221 contains an insulin_type which may freely flow through a needle_thinner than a g-29_needle
the court ruled that` thinner than g-29' means` thinner than 29 gauge but not thinner than 30 gauge'
the court explained that it adopted this construction despite the open-ended needle_size in the claims because` only one single value of this range g30 has been consistently defined'
the court observed that the ¡¬906_patent specification mentions only the 30 gauge_needle ; there is no disclosure of any thinner needle

novo argues that this construction ignores the plain language of the claims and incorrectly imports limitations from the specification into the claims
novo states that this construction violates the doctrine of claim differentiation for the claims of the other patents are specific to 30 gauge
novo also states that the district_court erroneously premised its claim construction on principles of enablement which is not at issue

novo conceded at oral argument that an affirmance of the jury_verdicts of invalidity with respect to the ¡¬535 and ¡¬323_patent s would in turn necessitate a finding that the ¡¬906_patent was also invalid
in light of that concession it is unnecessary to determine which construction of the ¡¬ 906 patent is correct
thus the judgment of invalidity of the ¡¬906_patent is affirmed

the cross-appeal
becton cross-appeals the district_courts denial of summary_judgment on the question of whether a certain novo publication is prior_art within the meaning of 35 u.s.c.¡± 102
denials of summary_judgment are not appealable
see glaros v. h.h
robertson co. 797_f.2d_1564 1573 230_uspq_393 399 fed.cir.1986 denial of summary_judgment is not reviewable on appeal from final judgment after trial on the issue

although becton argues that it is entitled to appeal the denial of summary_judgment because it relates to a` purely legal' question the question was litigated and decided at trial
it appears that becton made no motion for judgment as a matter of law on this issue
the decision of this question after trial and jury_verdict can not be circumvented through a pre-trial denial of a motion for summary_judgment
none of bectons purported authorities so holds

the cross-appeal is dismissed

costs
no costs
