opinion
rader circuit_judge
in this patent infringement action mehl/biophile international corp. selvac_acquisitions_corp. and dr. nardo zaias collectively mehl/biophile asserted that dr. sandy milgraum palomar_medical_technologies inc. and spectrum_medical_technologies inc. milgraum infringed u.s. patent no._5059,192 the192_patent
on its motion for summary_judgment milgraum contended that all of the192_patent claims were anticipated by an instruction_manual for the spectrum rd-1200_laser and by a 1987 journal of investigative dermatology article authored by dr. luigi polla and others the polla_article
the district_court agreed that the manual anticipated the claims granted summary_judgment of invalidity and dismissed the action
see mehl/biophile int l *1364 corp. v. milgraum 8_f.supp.2d_434 47_uspq2d_1248_(d.n.j.1998)
although this court disagrees that the manual discloses all the elements of the claimed invention because the polla_article does this court affirms

i
the192_patent entitled` method of hair depilation' claims a method for removing hair using a laser
hairs grows out of hair_follicles tubular apertures in the skin
the collection of germ cells from which hairs grow known as the papilla lies at the base of the follicle
the192_patent claims a method for destroying the papilla thereby preventing hair_regrowth
the written description discloses the use of a q-switched ruby_laser to effect the destruction

at a meeting of the american academy of dermatology dr._zaias visited spectrums booth where spectrum displayed such a laser known as the rd-1200
spectrum sold the rd-1200 for use in removing tattoos
dr._zaias recognized that the same principles that govern laser_absorption in skin pigmented by a tattoo would also focus laser_absorption on the natural skin pigment found in the papilla
more specifically the papilla contains granules called melanosomes of a dark pigment called melanin
a q-switched ruby_laser aimed at the hair_follicle will penetrate the skin and reach the papillary melanin
at a particular wavelength the laser will heat up and destroy the papilla without damaging surrounding tissue

claim 1 of the patent the only independent claim reads 1
a method of hair_depilation comprising the steps of a aligning a laser_light_applicator substantially vertically over a hair_follicle_opening said applicator having an aperture of sufficient area to surround a hair_follicle and overlie its papilla ; b applying through said aperture to the hair_follicle a pulse of laser energy of a wavelength which is readily absorbed by the melanin of the papilla and having a radiant exposure dose of sufficient energy and duration to damage its papilla so that hair_regrowth is prevented and scarring of the surrounding skin is avoided
dependent claims 2-6 further specify parameters of the laser_light_applicator energy delivery and the type of laser

mehl/biophile sued milgraum in the united_states_district_court for the district of new_jersey for infringement of all the claims of the192_patent
milgraum moved for summary_judgment of invalidity based on 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 1994 arguing that two prior_art_references each teach all the limitations of the claims
as noted at the outset milgraum relied on the manual for the rd-1200_laser which describes the use of a laser to remove tattoos
the manual teaches the use of a q-switched ruby_laser to remove a tattoo` [ e ] nergy is selectively absorbed only by pigmented chromophores and not surrounding tissue greatly reducing the risk of scarring'

milgraum also relied on the polla_article entitled` melanosomes are a primary target of q-switched ruby laser irradiation in guinea pig skin'
the polla_article documents` the tissue damage induced by q-switched ruby_laser pulses in black brown and albino control guinea_pigs.. in an effort to define the nature and extent of pigmented cell injury'
the method involves epilating guinea_pigs with soft wax holding the aperture of the laser in contact with the skin and pulsing the laser
using an electron microscope the researchers observed` disruption of melanosomes deep in the hair_papillae'

the district_court considered both references but ultimately rested its decision on the rd-1200_manual
mehl/biophile appeals
mehl/biophile makes several arguments for disregarding the manual as an anticipating reference
for instance mehl/biophile argues that the manual does not teach use of the laser to remove hair at all
further mehl/biophile contends that the manual does not disclose a substantially vertical_alignment a claim element
as for the polla_article *1365 mehl/biophile argues that the reference relates to guinea_pig skin and does not mention hair_depilation
in addition mehl/biophile contends that the epilation of the guinea_pig backs removed the papilla so the laser treatment could not have damaged the papilla

this court reviews a district_courts grant of summary_judgment by reapplying the standard applicable at the district_court
see conroy v. reebok int l ltd. 14_f.3d_1570 1575 29_uspq2d_1373 1377 fed.cir.1994
summary judgment is appropriate only when` there is no genuine_issue as to any material fact and.. the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law'

`` to anticipate a claim a prior_art_reference must disclose every limitation of the claimed invention either explicitly or inherently'
in re schreiber 128_f.3d_1473 1477 44_uspq2d_1429 1431 fed.cir.1997
as this courts predecessor stated in in re oelrich 666_f.2d_578 581 212_uspq_323 326 ccpa 1981 quoting hansgirg v. kemmer 26_c.c.p.a._937 102_f.2d_212 214 40_uspq_665 667 1939 internal citations omitted inherency however may not be established by probabilities or possibilities
the mere fact that a certain thing may result from a given set of circumstances is not sufficient
if however the disclosure is sufficient to show that the natural_result flowing from the operation as taught would result in the performance of the questioned function it seems to be well settled that the disclosure should be regarded as sufficient
thus a prior_art_reference may anticipate when the claim_limitation or limitations not expressly found in that reference are nonetheless inherent in it
see in re oelrich 666 f.2d at 581 ; verdegaal bros. inc. v. union oil co. of cal. 814_f.2d_628 630 2_uspq2d_1051 1053 fed.cir.1987
under the principles of inherency if the prior_art necessarily functions in accordance with or includes the claimed limitations it anticipates
see in re king 801_f.2d_1324 1326 231_uspq_136 138 fed.cir.1986
inherency is not necessarily coterminous with the knowledge of those of ordinary_skill in the art
artisans of ordinary_skill may not recognize the inherent characteristics or functioning of the prior_art
see id. 801 f.2d at 1326

the rd-1200 manual
the rd-1200_manual can not anticipate because it does not teach all the limitations of the claimed invention
claim 1 includes the step of` aligning a laser_light_applicator substantially vertically over a hair_follicle_opening'
the parties agree that the manual does not discuss hair_follicles let alone aligning the laser over a hair_follicle_opening
thus the manual does not explicitly teach alignment substantially vertically over a follicle opening
without explicit teachings of this claim_limitation this court must nonetheless examine whether such alignment is inherent in the manuals disclosure

the manual teaches aiming the laser at skin pigmented with tattoo ink
the record discloses no necessary relationship between the location of a tattoo and the location of hair_follicles
therefore an operator of the rd-1200_laser could use the laser according to the manual without necessarily aligning the laser` substantially vertically over a hair_follicle_opening'
the possibility of such an alignment does not legally suffice to show anticipation
see in re oelrich 666 f.2d at 581
occasional results are not inherent
because this court holds that the manual does not inherently teach this limitation of the claimed invention it does not address mehl/biophiles other arguments
to anticipate a single reference must teach every limitation of the claimed invention
without an inherent teaching about alignment the manual does not anticipate the claimed invention

*1366 the polla article
although the district_court did not reach the polla_article in its anticipation_analysis` [ a ] ppellees always have the right to assert alternative grounds for affirming the judgment that are supported by the record'
datascope corp. v. smec inc. 879_f.2d_820 822_n._1 11_uspq2d_1321 1322_n._1_(fed.cir.1989)
milgraum asserts that the polla_article constitutes such an alternative ground
this court agrees

as to the` aligning' step the polla_article does not suffer from the same deficiency as the manual
it is not a question of probabilities as to whether a person of ordinary_skill following the teachings of the article will align the laser_light_applicator over a hair_follicle
the researchers focused their study on the epilated backs of guinea_pigs
no one disputes that guinea_pigs have hairy backs
indeed the article itself is replete with references to the irradiation of hair_follicles and resulting follicular_damage at 0.8 j/cm 2 epidermal lesions were more marked and involved hair_follicles 0.3 mm below the skin_surface.. [ l ] esions were also present 0.5 mm deep in follicles
[ e ] ven at the highest radiant exposure 1.2 j/cm 2 brown [ guinea_pig ] skin never showed full-thickness epidermalnecrosis and at 0.8 j/cm 2 follicular_damage was observed to a depth of 0.5 mm and at 1.2 j/cm 2 to a depth of 0.7 mm below the skin_surface

.
.
.
.
.
follicular changes were similar in nature and extent to the epidermal alterations described above and were associated with melanosome disruption

.
.
.
.
.
specifically we have shown that.. pigmented structures in the deep dermis such as hair_follicles are affected..
the article further contains a photograph showing` [ f ] ollicular changes induced by ruby_laser'
the changes include disruption of` melanosomes contained within follicular epithelium'
moreover the article specifically mentioned disruption of the hair_papillae at 0.big_token__8_and_1__big_token2 j/cm 2 individual melanosomes were more intensely damaged and disruption of melanosomes deep in the hair_papillae was observed
finally the method of exposing the q-switched ruby_laser to the guinea_pig skin also inherently teaches substantially vertical_alignment over hair_follicle_openings the collimated laser beam struck a circular aperture 2.5 mm in diameter held in contact with the skin of the animals
the record shows that holding the collimated laser in contact with the skin would align it perpendicular to the skin_surface and therefore substantially vertically over follicle openings
viewed as a whole this disclosure shows in the words of in re oelrich 666 f.2d at 581 that the` natural_result flowing from the operation as taught would result in' alignment of the laser light over a hair_follicle as claimed
no reasonable jury could find otherwise

mehl/biophiles remaining arguments concerning the polla_article are unavailing
the polla_article concerns itself with guinea_pig rather than human skin but that difference is irrelevant to the anticipation_analysis
nothing in the claim limits the methods reach to human skin
similarly the polla_articles failure to mention hair_depilation as a goal is similarly irrelevant
mehl/biophile does not dispute on appeal that the laser operating parameters disclosed in the article substantially coincide with those disclosed in the patent
accordingly to the extent the embodiment in the patent achieves hair_depilation so does the polla method
where as here the result is a necessary consequence of what was deliberately intended it is of no import that the articles authors did not appreciate the results
see w.l
gore & assocs
v. garlock inc. 721_f.2d_1540 1548 220_uspq_303 309 fed.cir.1983
finally as mentioned earlier the article itself belies mehl/biophiles argument that the wax epilation prescribed by the article resulted in removal of the papilla
*1367 the article specifically states that` disruption of melanosomes deep in the hair_papillae was observed'
mehl/biophiles expert testimony contradicting the plain language of the reference does not create a genuine_issue of fact

thus the polla_article anticipates claim 1 of the192_patent
because mehl/biophile has not separately argued the validity of the dependent claims the judgment of invalidity as to those claims also stands

each party shall bear its own costs
