dyk circuit_judge
victorias secret_direct_brand_management llc` victorias secret' and avon_products inc.` avon' collectively` defendants' appeal from a judgment of the district court for the eastern_district of texas
the district_court found that defendants infringed claims 34_and_51 of u.s._patent_no._5715,314 the` ¡¬314_patent` and claims 15 17 and 39 of u.s._patent_no._5909,492 the` ¡¬492_patent` and that those claims were not invalid

after the district_courts judgment this court decided soverain_software_llc v. newegg_inc. 705_f.3d_1333_(fed.cir.2013) amended on reh g 728_f.3d_1332 1336 fed.cir.2013 hereinafter` newegg`
there we held invalid as obvious_claims 34_and_51 of the ¡¬314_patent and claims 17 41 and 61 of the ¡¬492_patent
id.at 1341 1344
we hold that issue_preclusion applies as a result of the newegg case and that the asserted claims here are therefore invalid
accordingly we reverse

background
soverain_software_llc` soverain' is the assignee of the ¡¬314 and ¡¬492_patent s. it brought an infringement action against defendants in the eastern_district of texas
the asserted claims fall into two categories
claims 34_and_51 of the ¡¬314_patent and claim 17 of the ¡¬492_patent are directed to virtual_shopping_carts.big_token__1_claims_15__big_token and 39 of the ¡¬492_patent are directed to *1314 using a hypertext_statement so that users can access information about past orders.2

on november 18 2011 a jury determined that defendants infringed the asserted claims and that those claims were not invalid as anticipated or obvious
the district_court subsequently entered judgment in favor of soverain
defendants appealed on september 7 2012

subsequent to the filing of the appeal on january 22 2013 this court decided newegg a case from the eastern_district of texas in which soverain also alleged infringement of the ¡¬314 and ¡¬492_patent s. there the district_court had entered judgment that the asserted claims were infringed and not invalid
on appeal we reversed holding invalid as obvious_claims 34_and_51 of the ¡¬314_patent and claims 17 41 and 61 of the ¡¬492_patent
newegg 705_f.3d_1333 at 1347
in a subsequent panel rehearing decision we clarified that claim 35 is also invalid
we` confirm [ ed ] that claim 34 is representative of theshopping_cart claims including claim 35 and conclude [ d ] that dependent_claim 35 is invalid on the ground of obviousness'
soverain_software_llc v. newegg_inc. 728_f.3d_1332 1336 fed.cir.2013 hereinafter` newegg_ii`3

we apply the law of the regional circuit to the general procedural question of whether issue_preclusion applies
rf del. inc. v. pac
keystone techs. inc. 326_f.3d_1255 1261 fed.cir.2003
we apply this courts precedent to questions involving substantive issues of patent law issues of issue_preclusion that implicate substantive patent law issues or issues of issue_preclusion that implicate the scope of our own previous decisions

bradberry v. jefferson cnty. tex. 732_f.3d_540 549 5th cir.2013 citation omitted

discussion
i
the first question is whether issue_preclusion or collateral_estoppel should *1315 apply to claims 34_and_51 of the ¡¬314_patent and claims 15_and_17 of the ¡¬492_patent as a result of the newegg judgment
`` issue preclusion prohibits a party from seeking another determination of the litigated issue in the subsequent_action'
auto ins co. v. logisticare solutions llc 751_f.3d_684 689 5th cir.2014 quoting united_states v. shanbaum 10_f.3d_305 311 5th cir.1994
auto
the fifth circuit applies issue_preclusion where the following four conditions are satisfied first the issue under consideration in a subsequent_action must be identical to the issue litigated in a prior_action
second the issue must have been fully and vigorously litigated in the prior_action
third the issue must have been necessary to support the judgment in the prior case
fourth there must be no special circumstance that would render preclusion inappropriate or unfair
id
( quoting shanbaum 10 f.3d at 311
our own law is similar
jet inc. v. sewage aeration sys. 223_f.3d_1360 1366 fed.cir.2000 issue_preclusion requires four conditions` 1 identity of the issues in a prior proceeding ; 2 the issues were actually litigated ; 3 the determination of the issues was necessary to the resulting judgment ; and 4 the party defending against preclusion had a full and fair_opportunity to litigate the issues' citations omitted

in newegg we explicitly held that claims 34_and_51 of the ¡¬314_patent and claim 17 of the ¡¬492_patent were obvious
705 f.3d at 1341
although claim 15 of the ¡¬492_patent at issue here was not explicitly invalidated in newegg we invalidated claim 41 which depends from claim 15
id.at 1344
therefore the invalidity determination as to claim 41 extended to claim 15 as well
see callaway golf co. v. acushnet co. 576_f.3d_1331 1344 fed.cir.2009` a broader independent_claim can not be nonobvious where a dependent_claim stemming from that independent_claim is invalid for obviousness'
( citation omitted

the supreme_court has held that a defense of issue_preclusion applies where a party is` facing a charge of infringement of a patent that has once been declared invalid' even though the party asserting the defense was not a party to the action where the patent was invalidated
blonder-tongue labs. inc. v. univ
of ill
found. 402_u.s._313 349-50 91_s.ct._1434 28_l.ed.2d_788_(1971)
we have similarly held that` once the claims of a patent are held invalid in a suit involving one alleged infringer an unrelated party who is sued for infringement of those claims may reap the benefit of the invalidity_decision under principles of collateral_estoppel'
mendenhall v. barber-greene co. 26_f.3d_1573 1577 fed.cir.1994 ; see in re cygnus telecomms

it is also established that issue_preclusion applies even though the precluding judgment newegg comes into existence while the case as to which preclusion is sought this case is on appeal

as to the four claims listed above soverain agrees that issue_preclusion would normally be applicable but argues that it should not apply here because soverain has not had a full and fair_opportunity to litigate the issue of obviousness

under issue_preclusion law generally and under both our law and fifth circuit law a judgment of invalidity will not have a preclusive effect if a patentee *1316 can demonstrate that it did not have a full and fair_opportunity to litigate the issue
blumcraft of pittsburgh v. kawneer co. 482_f.2d_542 546-47 5th cir.1973 ; see blonder-tongue 402 u.s. at 333 91_s.ct._1434 a patentee` must be permitted to demonstrate if he can that he did not have a fair_opportunity procedurally substantively and evidentially to pursue his claim the first time` citation omitted ; pharmacia 170 f.3d at 1379` [ a ] judgment of invalidity will have no collateral_estoppel effect if the patentee can show that it did not have a full and fair_opportunity to litigate
`` ; restatement second of judgments_¡± 28 5 1982 a party is not precluded where` the party sought to be precluded as a result of the conduct of his adversary or other special circumstances did not have an adequate opportunity or incentive to obtain a full and fair adjudication in the initial_action'

we need not here review the various grounds that are relevant to whether a party had a full and fair_opportunity to litigate because most are inapplicable here
see generally blonder-tongue 402 u.s. at 332-34 91_s.ct._1434 ; restatement second of judgments_¡±¡± 28 29
for example the issue of incentive to litigate arises where` [ t ] he stakes in the first_action may be so small that extensive effort is not reasonable if the risk is limited to the first_action'
18 charles alan wright arthur r. miller & edward h. cooper federal practice & procedure ¡± 4423 2d ed.2002
that circumstance does not exist here
soverain does not dispute that it was represented by distinguished counsel in that appeal and that the amount in controversy was significant

the unusual full and fair_opportunity argument made here requires an understanding of the appeal in newegg
in the district_court in newegg at the close of evidence soverain and the defendant newegg_inc.` newegg' filed cross-motions for judgment as a matter of law` jmol' ; the district_court granted soverains jmol_motion of non-obviousness and denied neweggs jmol_motion of obviousness
see newegg 705 f.3d at 1336
as a result of the grant of soverains motion the jury did not address obviousness
id

after the jurys verdict the district_court denied neweggs renewed jmol_motion and alternative motion for a new_trial
id
newegg_appealed from the district_courts judgment of non-obviousness
id
while newegg had preserved in the district_court the argument that it should have been granted jmol on the issue of obviousness on appeal newegg explicitly argued only that the district_court erred in granting jmol for soverain on the issue of non-obviousness and in not granting neweggs motion for a new_trial.4 see id
newegg also requested` any other and further relief to which it may be justly entitled'
j.a
37701

we acknowledged that newegg on appeal had argued only for a new_trial but noted that` [ h ] owever questions of law must be correctly decided..' newegg 705 f.3d at 1337
on` th [ o ] se premises we determine [ d ] the question of obviousness'
*1317 id
the primary evidence before us in newegg regarding invalidity was the` compuserve_mall' system a prior electronic commerce system including two books describing the system which disclosed the use of electronic shopping_carts
id.at 1337-38 1340-41 1343-44
soverains arguments for nonobviousness relied on features that were either` not embodied in the claims and not reflected in the claim_construction' id.at 1339 ; see id.at 1341 or related to incorporation of known internet technology id.at 1340 1343-44

soverain petitioned for rehearing and rehearing en banc
soverain argued that the court improperly ordered jmol when on appeal newegg had asked only for a new_trial
additionally soverain and newegg both noted that claim 35 of the ¡¬ 314 patent had not been addressed in our decision even though it had been included in the district_courts judgment of no invalidity
we subsequently granted panel rehearing and after considering supplemental briefing and arguments` confirm [ ed ] that claim 34 is representative of theshopping_cart claims including claim 35 and conclude [ d ] that dependent_claim 35 is invalid on the ground of obviousness'
newegg_ii 728 f.3d at 1336
we implicitly rejected the patentees argument that the court should have granted a new_trial rather than jmol id. implicitly rejecting the idea that soverain did not have a full and fair_opportunity to litigate
rehearing en banc was denied
soverain_software_llc v. newegg_inc. no._2011-1009 fed.cir
sept._4,_2013 order denying en banc rehearing
soverains petition for a writ of certiorari to the supreme_court was denied
soverain_software_llc v. newegg_inc. -- - u.s. -- -- 134_s.ct._910 187_l.ed.2d_779_(2014)

we note that soverain does not argue that it was deprived of crucial evidence or witnesses in the first litigation or that it would present additional evidence at a new_trial
see blonder-tongue 402 u.s. at 333 91_s.ct._1434
nor is there any contention that soverain did not have a full and fair_opportunity to litigate the question of obviousness at the district_court
rather soverains argument is that it did not have the incentive to fully litigate the issue of non-obviousness on appeal.5

specifically soverain contends that it would have raised different or additional arguments on appeal if it had known that this court might reverse the district_court on invalidity rather than only granting a new_trial
but soverain does not cite any case to support the notion that a full and fair_opportunity to litigate is lacking where a party might have argued differently on appeal
in newegg the same basic issue of obviousness was central whether the focus was on insufficiency of the evidence as a ground for jmol or on insufficiency of the evidence as a ground for a new_trial
not surprisingly soverain has not identified any significant new arguments that were not in fact raised in the earlier appeal

with respect to the shopping_cart patents claims 34_and_51 of the ¡¬ 314 patent and claim 17 of the ¡¬492_patent soverain argues that it did not have a full and fair *1318 opportunity to present its arguments in newegg that` product_identifiers' a limitation in each of the asserted claims distinguish the prior art compuserve_mall_system
basically a product_identifier identifies which product a user has placed in a shopping_cart.6 see ¡¬314_patent col. 3_ll._45 -47 col. 5_ll._29 -30 col. 14_ll._9 -10
but soverain presented the same arguments about product_identifiers in newegg that it puts forward here
here soverain points to expert testimony to argue that the compuserve_mall_system did not utilize product_identifiers because that system was a single computer system that always recognized the identity of the user and which product the user was viewing
similarly in newegg soverain contended that` neweggs fact witness mr. trevor testified that the compuserve_mall did not employ product_identifiers and was therefore not programmed to send shopping_cart_messages.. each of which comprises a product_identifier'
brief of plaintiff-appellee_soverain_software_llc at 45 newegg 705_f.3d_1333 no._2011-1009 alterations in original internal_quotation_marks and citation omitted
soverain argued that` [ a ] s soverains expert dr. shamos explained the basic architecture of the compuserve_mall was specifically designed so that the system would be able to ascertain which products the customer had selected for purchase without the use of a separate product_identifier'
id
( internal_quotation_marks and citation omitted
this court in newegg considered and rejected soverains arguments about the product_identifier
we discussed the testimony by soverains expert that the compuserve_system lacked the product_identifier limitation and rejected the experts conclusions
newegg 705 f.3d at 1339-40
we found that` [ t ] he product_identifier message term does not distinguish the shopping_cart claims from the prior art compuserve_mall'
id.at 1340

soverain also argues that it did not have the opportunity in newegg to present its arguments that the confirmation numbers from the compuserve_mall_system did not satisfy the limitations of the hypertext_statement_claims claims 15_and_39 of the ¡¬492_patent
soverain argues that its expert testimony established that the compuserve_system did not provide online access to information or suggest providing hyperlinked transaction documents as required by the claims
but soverain made this same argument in its newegg briefing stating that` [ t ] he compuserve_mall did not have the capability for customers to review their order status or transaction history online'
brief of plaintiff-appellee_soverain_software_llc at 46 newegg 705_f.3d_1333 no._2011-1009
in newegg we addressed soverains argument that in the` compuserve_mall [ ] it might be necessary to resort to the telephone or email to get the transaction information..' 705 f.3d at 1343
we reasoned that the patentee` did not invent the internet or hypertext or the url.. [ t ] he use of hypertext to communicate a statement_document ortransaction_detail_document was a routine_incorporation of internet_technology into existing processes'
id.at 1344 citations omitted

soverain further argues that it did not focus on the credibility of neweggs expert witness` because soverain was seeking to affirm jmol of non-obviousness by relying on [ neweggs experts ] failure to establish that certain claim elements were prima facie present'
appellees br
29
specifically soverain argues that it would have presented evidence that neweggs expert mr._tittel was discredited on cross-examination because he admitted that he did not conduct an element-by-element *1319 comparison of the claims to the prior art apply the district_courts claim_construction or review the prosecution history of the patents
but soverain did have the incentive to raise these arguments in the newegg_appeal
the district_court had issued jmol for soverain having found that newegg failed to present a prima_facie_case of obviousness
newegg 705 f.3d at 1337
on appeal the question was whether jmol was inappropriate because tittels testimony established a prima_facie_case of obviousness as newegg argued
see id
we concluded that tittels testimony established that each element of the claims was present in the compuserve_system and relied on that testimony
id.at 1338 1342-43
soverain did have the incentive to argue that tittels testimony did not support neweggs obviousness arguments because mr._tittel for example did not conduct an element-by-element analysis
the fact that soverain had arguments which it did not make does not mean that soverain lacked the incentive to make them

ii
the remaining question is whether issue_preclusion applies to invalidate claim 39 a hypertext_statement claim of the ¡¬492_patent
claim 39 depends from claim 15
claim 15 was invalidated as obvious in newegg
see newegg 705 f.3d at 1344 invalidating as obvious claim 41 which depends from claim 15
the only additional_limitation in claim 39 concerns the internet
claim 39 recites` [ a ] hypertext_statement in accordance with claim 15,7 wherein the network is an internet'
¡¬492_patent reexamination certificate cbig_token__1_col._1__big_token ll
21-22

soverain argues that issue_preclusion should not apply because claim 39 was not previously found obvious and does not present identical issues
complete identity of claims is not required to satisfy the identity-of-issues requirement for claim preclusion
ohio_willow_wood 735 f.3d at 1342 ; see aspex v. marchon eyewear inc. 672_f.3d_1335 1341 2012 in the claim preclusion context
`` if the differences between the unadjudicated patent claims and adjudicated patent claims do not materially alter the question of invalidity collateral_estoppel applies'
ohio_willow_wood 735 f.3d at 1342 citing bourns inc. v. united_states 537_f.2d_486 493 ct.cl.1976
in ohio_willow_wood we applied issue_preclusion to invalidate a claim where a different claim in another patent had previously been invalidated because` the [ ] patents use [ d ] slightly different language to describe substantially the same invention'
id
we also found that a difference in claim scope was not fatal to the application of estoppel
id.at 1343
the previously-invalidated claim contained a limitation requiring only polymeric gel whereas the unadjudicated claim required more specifically block copolymer gel
id
we held that because the patentee failed to explain how the additional_limitation would change an invalidity_analysis the patentee had not met its burden in opposing summary judgment
id

the additional_limitation here-transmitting a hypertext_statement over the internet rather than over a generic network-does not materially alter the question of the validity of claim 39
in newegg as to the hypertext_statement_claims the court noted that neweggs expert tittel had testified that compuserve was not on the internet
newegg 705 f.3d at 1343
we explained that as conceded by soverains expert shamos the patentee` did not invent the internet or hypertext or the url'
id.at 1344 citing shamos testimony
`` [ t ] he use of hypertext to [ perform the limitations of the hypertext *1320 statement claims ] was a routine_incorporation of internet_technology into existing processes'
id
( citations omitted
here too the routine_incorporation of internet_technology in claim 39 does not change the invalidity_analysis

the invalidity of the asserted claims of the ¡¬314 and ¡¬492_patent s is established by issue_preclusion
the judgment of infringement and no invalidity accordingly is reversed

in its briefs in the newegg_appeal newegg had stated that claim 34 was asserted and was representative of the shopping_cart claims
