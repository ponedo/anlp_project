plastics inc.` l.b
plastics' appeals from the final judgment of the united_states_district_court for the western_district of north_carolina granting summary_judgment of noninfringement in favor of amerimax_home_products inc. and amerimax_diversified_products inc. collectively` amerimax'
we hold that the asserted claims of u.s. patent no._6463,700 filed jan._16,_2001` ¡¬700_patent` were not literally infringed and that l.b
plastics can not invoke the doctrine of *1305 equivalents in the circumstances of this case
we therefore affirm

background
l.b
plastics and amerimax both sell gutter_guards which are devices that can be attached to a conventional gutter in order to allow the free flow of water into the gutter while filtering out dirt leaves and other debris
the claimed invention relates to a composite_gutter_guard that snaps onto existing gutters

?
fig._1
l.b
plastics filed the application that resulted in the ¡¬700_patent on january 16 2001
the application described a gutter_guard that includes a guard_panel to which is attached a` mesh_layer'
u.s. patent application no._09 /760,557` ¡¬557_application'
the original claims of the ¡¬557_application required the guard_panel and mesh_layer to be attached by` a heat weld connecting said mesh_layer to said guard_panel'
id

on december 5 2001 the u.s. patent and trademark office` pto' rejected the claims submitted by l.b
plastics` as being unpatentable over u.s._patent_no._5555,680 to sweers in view of u.s._patent_no._5406,754 [` ¡¬754_patent` ] to cosby'
in rejecting the application the examiner explained sweers does not disclose welding a continuous weld along the entire edge of the mesh_layer
however cosby discloses using spot weld every 12 inches along the mesh_layer..
it would have been obvious to one having ordinary_skill in the art at the time the invention was made to modify sweers by adding welds disclosed by cosby and to make the welds continuous without breaks in order to create a better bond between layers and to prevent debris from entering between layers
j.a.at 121 emphasis added
in its response l.b
plastics argued that a continuous weld line would distinguish the spot welding disclosed in the cosby prior_art because it would stop debris from flowing beneath the mesh_layer and into the gutter
j.a.at 131
the examiner then allowed the claims to issue after l.b
plastics amended the claims to require *1306` a continuous_heat weld defining an uninterrupted longitudinal weld'

the ¡¬700_patent issued on october 15 2002
the ¡¬700_patent contains fourteen claims of which three are independent
claim 1 is representative and claims a composite_gutter_guard adapted for being positioned at an opening of a longitudinally extending generally u-shaped gutter used for collecting and distributing rainwater_runoff from the roofs of residential homes and other buildings said gutter_guard comprising a an elongate polymer_guard_panel defining a plurality of spaced filter openings said guard_panel being adapted to extend laterally across the opening of the gutter and longitudinally along the length of the gutter ; b a polymer-coated mesh_layer overlying said guard_panel in an area of said filter openings and cooperating with said guard_panel to capture and separate debris from rainwater_runoff entering the gutter said mesh_layer having first and second opposing side edges and first and second opposing_end_edges ; and
( c a continuous_heat weld defining an uninterrupted_longitudinal_weld_line connecting said mesh_layer to said guard_panel and extending from one end_edge of said mesh later [ sic ] to the opposing_end_edge of said mesh_layer
¡¬700_patent emphasis added to show amendment during prosecution
each of the other independent claims claims 9_and_14 similarly requires that the guard_panel be welded to the mesh_layer and that the resulting` weld line' be` continuous
`` 1

two prior_art patents u.s._patent_no._5555,680 to sweers and u.s._patent_no._5406,754` ¡¬754_patent` to cosby are relevant and were cited during prosecution of the ¡¬700_patent
j.a.at 120
both sweers and cosby disclose gutter_guards
sweers discloses a one-piece gutter_guard while cosby has a separate screen which the claims require to be` directly connected' to the guard_panel
¡¬754_patent col.6 i.17
cosbys specification discloses several means of` directly connect [ ing ]' the screen to the guard_panel
it first states that` [ t ] he fine mesh screen [ ] can be attached by adhesive mechanical fastener or heat welded to the wire mesh'
id
col 4 i.65-col.5 i.1
an example then illustrates the method of` bond [ ing ].. approximately every 12 inches'
id
col.5 ii.40-44
then the specification again states that` [ a ] n adhesive can be applied.. or some other_means of attachment can be made'
id
col.6 ii.1-4

the specification of the ¡¬700_patent criticizes prior_art_attachment means stating` [ t ] he attachment means used in other_prior_art_gutter_guards incorporating multiple_layers is generally less effective and more costly time consuming and labor intensive'
¡¬700_patent_col.1_ii.27-29

on february 24 2004 l.b
plastics filed this action against amerimax alleging that amerimaxs competing gutter_guard infringed the ¡¬700_patent
amerimaxs gutter_guard is comprised of a mesh screen attached to a guard_panel by means of an adhesive hot glue which is later cooled
this glue does not soften or melt the mesh *1307 or the guard_panel
l.b
plastics argued that amerimaxs gutter_guard literally infringed the ¡¬700_patent because the` continuous_heat weld' limitation of that patent was broad enough to encompass the hot_glue_adhesive used by amerimax
in the alternative l.b
plastics contended that its patented weld and amerimaxs hot_glue_adhesive were equivalent
both parties moved for summary_judgment on infringement
the court granted amerimaxs motion and denied l.b
plasticss motion

the district_court first held that no reasonable jury could conclude that amerimaxs gutter_guard literally infringes l.b
plasticss patent because amerimaxs process does not involve` heat weld' or` welding'
in construing those terms the district_court first recognized that while the claims do not define the terms a standard dictionary defining` weld' as` to unite [ plastics ] by heating and allowing the [ plastics ] to flow together' was consistent with the statement in the specification that the mesh` fuse [ ]' to the polymer_guard_panel
l.b
plastics inc. v. amerimax home prods. inc. 431_f.supp.2d_578 581 w.d.n.c.2006 quoting merriam-webster online dictionary http //www
m-w.com/dictionary/weld ; ¡¬700_patent col.3 i.44
the district_court noted that the reference to` fus [ ing ]' in the specification confirmed its analysis because we have previously construed the term` fusion-bonding' to exclude a heat-activated adhesive that did not melt the components it was fusing together
l.b
plastics 431 f.supp.2d at 582 citing trilogy commc'ns inc. v. times fiber commc'ns inc. 109_f.3d_739 744 fed.cir.1997
the district_court found that it was undisputed that the adhesive amerimaxs gutter_guard does not melt the components that it attaches and concluded that summary_judgment for amerimax was therefore appropriate on the issue of literal_infringement

turning to the doctrine of equivalents the district_court held that summary_judgment in favor of amerimax was appropriate for two reasons
first the district_court credited expert_testimony that while the methods of welding and gluing with adhesives accomplish the same function of joining two objects to each other they were not equivalents because they accomplish a different result in a different way since welding involves allowing the molecules of the two objects to interface thereby connecting them whereas joining with adhesives involves the introduction of a third substance
see warner-jenkinson co. v. hilton davis chem co. 520_u.s._17 35 117_s.ct._1040 137_l.ed.2d_146_(1997) quoting union paper-bag machine co. v. murphy 97_u.s._120 125 24_l.ed._935_(1878) function-way-result test for doctrine of equivalents
next the district_court held that prosecution_history estoppel barred l.b
plastics from invoking the doctrine of equivalents because` [ d ] espite its knowledge of other_means of attachment specifically including adhesives l.b
plastics only filed claims relating to` hot weld' or` welding' the layers of its gutter_guard'

discussion
i literal infringement
l.b
plastics first argues that the district_court erred in construing the term` weld' to require melting of the screen and guard_panel and that consequently the district_courts grant of summary_judgment of noninfringement was improper

in construing claims we search for the ordinary and customary meaning of a claim term to a person of ordinary_skill in the art
we determine this meaning by looking first at intrinsic evidence such as surrounding claim language the specification the prosecution_history and also at extrinsic_evidence which may include expert_testimony and dictionaries
phillips v. awh corp. 415_f.3d_1303 1314-19 fed.cir.2005 en banc
the specification of the ¡¬700_patent describes` a composite_gutter_guard according to the present_invention' and discloses that` [ t ] he mesh_layer.. is attached to the guard_panel [ ] by continuous ultrasonic or heat welding'
the attachment involves the use of a mesh preferably constructed of a material` which readily fuses to the polymer_guard_panel [ ] during welding'
¡¬700_patent col.3 ii.31-32 39-44 emphasis added

since the intrinsic record provides no further guidance to the meaning of the terms` weld'` fuse' or` ultrasonic or heat welding' the district_court properly turned to extrinsic_evidence in this case and consulted dictionaries
see phillips 415 f.3d at 1317-18
here general and technical dictionaries clearly confirm the district_courts construction of the disputed term` weld' to require melting of the parts that are being joined
see websters third new international dictionary 2594 2002 defining` weld' as` to unite or consolidate.. by heating to a plastic or fluid state the surfaces of the parts to be joined and then allowing the metals to flow together' ; mcgraw-hill dictionary of scientific and technical terms 2288 6th ed.2003 defining` welding' as` [ j ] oining two metals by applying heat to melt and fuse them' ; see also d.c
miles & j.h
briston polymer technology 651 chem
pub g co. 1979 describing ultrasonic welding as a process where` the mechanical energy of motion is transformed into heat which melts the mating surfaces of the plastics'
the definition of` fuse' -terminology used in the specification to describe the` welding' process-is also consistent with the district_courts construction of the term` weld'
see websters at 925 defining` fuse' as` reduce to a liquid or plastic state by heat dissolve melt.. liquefy'2

consequently we conclude that the district_court correctly construed the term` welding'
the district_court granted summary_judgment of no literal_infringement after it found that` [ t ] here is no dispute that the mesh_layer in amerimaxs gutter_guard is not attached to the guard_panel bywelding as construed above'
l.b
plastics 431 f.supp.2d at 582
having found that no dispute of material fact existed under the correct claim construction the district_court properly granted summary_judgment on the issue of literal_infringement

*1309 ii infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
however l.b
plastics maintains that amerimax infringes under the doctrine of equivalents
`` the doctrine of equivalents allows the patentee to claim those insubstantial alterations that were not captured in drafting the original patent claim but which could be created through trivial changes'
festo corp. v. shoketsu kinzoku kogyo kabushiki co. 535_u.s._722 733 122_s.ct._1831 152_l.ed.2d_944_(2002)
amerimax argues that l.b
plastics can not invoke the doctrine of equivalents in this situation because the specification of the ¡¬700_patent makes clear that prior_art_attachment means which included adhesives are not within the scope of the ¡¬700_patent

we have held that when a specification excludes certain prior_art alternatives from the literal scope of the claims and criticizes those prior_art alternatives the patentee can not then use the doctrine of equivalents to capture those alternatives
in dawn equipment co. v. kentucky farms inc. 140_f.3d_1009_(fed.cir.1998) we described as` damning evidence' the fact that the specification of the patent-in-suit noted the disadvantages of prior_art` multi-hole pinned height adjustment mechanisms' in devices for adjusting the height of farm implements and described the mechanism provided by the patented invention as solving such problems
id.at 1016
we concluded that the patentee could not resort to the doctrine of equivalents to establish infringement when the accused device used the same mechanism as the criticized prior_art devices
id.at 1016-17
in scimed life sys. inc. v. advanced cardiovascular sys. inc. 242_f.3d_1337_(fed.cir.2001) we concluded that because the common specification of the patents-in-suit` referred to prior_art catheters identified them as using [ the same configuration used by the accused device ] and criticized them as suffering from [ several ] disadvantages' the doctrine of equivalents was unavailable to recapture the catheters
id.at 1345
`` having specifically identified criticized and disclaimed the dual lumen configuration the patentee can not now invoke the doctrine of equivalents to embrace a structure that was specifically excluded from the claims'
id
( internal quotation marks omitted
similarly in schwing gmbh v. putzmeister aktiengesellschaft 305_f.3d_1318_(fed.cir.2002) we noted that the patent-in-suit criticized` the use of embedded metal rings in the prior_art' and concluded that` schwing can not now overlook that deliberate decision and reclaim that subject matter through the doctrine of equivalents'
id.at 1329 ; see also astrazeneca ab v. mutual pharm co. 384_f.3d_1333 1340 1342 fed.cir.2004 ; gaus v. conair corp. 363_f.3d_1284 1291 fed.cir.2004 ; j & m corp. v. harley-davidson inc. 269_f.3d_1360 1369 fed.cir.2001

the rule of these cases applies here as well
the specification of the ¡¬ 700 patent criticizes prior_art_attachment means stating that` [ t ] he attachment means used in other_prior_art_gutter_guards.. is generally less effective and more costly time consuming and labor intensive'
¡¬700_patent_col.1_ii.27-30
the specification emphasizes that the` novel_construction' of the invention by contrast` facilitates an effective and secure_attachment'
id
; ii.24-26.3 there is no question but that the *1310 prior_art_attachment means included adhesives ; thus the specification must be read to criticize the use of adhesives as attachment means
see ¡¬754_patent col.4 ii.67-68 ; id
col.6 ii.1-4
however l.b
plastics argues that the prior_art referenced in the specification did not specifically disclose a continuous attachment using adhesives
but since the patentee elected to distinguish prior_art_attachment means and to limit its claim to continuous welded attachments a person of ordinary_skill in the field of the invention reading the specification would clearly conclude that the inventor thought that adhesive_attachments generally were undesirable
under these circumstances l.b
plastics can not now use the doctrine of equivalents to include adhesive_attachments

we therefore affirm the district_courts holding that l.b
plastics can not resort to the doctrine of equivalents here

conclusion
for the foregoing reasons the decision below is affirmed

thus claim 9 requires` a longitudinal weld line connecting said mesh_layer to said guard_panel and extending continuously from one end_edge of said mesh_layer to the other ;' and claim 14 a method claim requires` welding the mesh_layer to the guard_panel along a continuous and uninterrupted_longitudinal_weld_line extending from one end_edge of the mesh_layer to the opposing_end_edge of the mesh_layer'
¡¬700_patent col.5 ii.3-6 col.6 ii.18-21

l.b
plastics argues that` welding' includes attachment by adhesives citing testimony of the inventor of the ¡¬700_patent that` one of ordinary_skill in the relevant art.. considers [ heat welding and hot melt gluing ] to be essentially the same'
pet r br.at 30-31
this testimony is irrelevant as there is no suggestion that davis testified that the term` welding' has a special meaning within the art that is different from its ordinary meaning
3
the specification states unlike some prior_art gutter_guards which have a relatively fine-mesh metal layer overlying a perforated polymer_guard_panel the gutter_guard of the present_invention includes a coated mesh_layer and perforated guard_panel formed of like polymer materials such as pvc
this novel_construction facilitates an effective and secure_attachment of the composite by ultrasonic or heat welding along the entire length of the gutter_guard
the attachment means used in other_prior_art_gutter_guards incorporating multiple_layers is generally less effective and more costly time consuming and labor intensive
