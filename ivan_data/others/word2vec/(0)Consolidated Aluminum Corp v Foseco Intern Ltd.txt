background
we presume familiarity with the` memorandum_opinion' of the district_court 716_f.supp._316 11_uspq2d_1817_(n.d.ill.1989) and the` report and recommendation' of the special_master,1 10_uspq2d_1143_(n.d.ill.1988)

on may_4,_1982 consolidated sued four parties foseco alumax trialco and fil charging violations of its rights under six united states patents nos._3893,917917 3,962,081081 4,024,056056 4,081,371371 4,024,212212 and 4,075,303303 relating to the manufacture and use of ceramic_foam_filters for molten_metal particularly aluminum
all of the charged violations relate to fosecos sivex ceramic filter
foseco is charged with joint contributory or induced_infringement of the917_patent in making and selling the sivex ; alumax and trialco are charged with direct_infringement of the917_patent in using the sivex ; fil is charged with inducing infringement of the917 by encouraging foseco to commercialize and teaching foseco how to make the sivex ; foseco is charged with direct and contributory_infringement of the081_patent in making and selling the sivex ; alumax and trialco are charged with direct_infringement of the081_patent in using the sivex ; fil is charged with contributory or induced_infringement of the081 in encouraging foseco to commercialize and teaching foseco how to make the sivex ; foseco is charged with contributory_infringement of the056 and371_patent s in using the sivex ; alumax and trialco are charged with direct_infringement of the056 and371_patent s in using the sivex ; fil is charged with contributory or induced_infringement of the212 and303_patent s in encouraging foseco to commercialize and helping and teaching foseco to make the sivex.2 defendants filed counterclaims alleging antitrust_violations

on october 31 1988 after a six-week trial involving more than 2000 exhibits and testimony from 27 witnesses in court and 70 witnesses by deposition the special_master issued a 94 page` report and recommendation' holding 1 claims 1-big_token__2_and_4__big_token -9 of the917_patent claims 2 7 8 10 and 14 of the081_patent the056_patent the371_patent claims 15 20 and 24 of the212_patent and claims 3 7 15 and 20 of the303_patent invalid in view of the prior_art 35 u.s.c.¡±¡± 102 103 ; 2 the917_patent invalid for failure to disclose the best_mode 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ; 3 the917_patent unenforceable because consolidateds intentional_withholding of the best_mode and disclosure of a fictitious inoperative mode constituted inequitable_conduct ; 4 claims 1 4 5 and 9 of the081_patent claims 1 2 and 18 of the212_patent and claim 1 of the303_patent not invalid and willfully infringed by foseco and fil ; 5 claims 1 4 5 and 9 of the081_patent infringed by trialco and alumax ; 6 that *807 consolidated had not committed antitrust_violations ; 7 that further_infringement should be permanently enjoined ; 8 that consolidateds request to change inventorship of the917 and081_patent s be denied see 35 u.s.c.¡± 256 ; and 9 that` yarwood and preuss were improperly added as named inventors of the363_patent
`` 3

the parties submitted objections to the special_masters report and recommendation pursuant to rule 53 e 2 fed.r.civ.p
on june_15,_1989 the district_court issued a 46 page` memorandum_opinion' affirming the determinations that 1 the917371 and056_patent s were invalid ; 2 the917_patent was invalid for failure to disclose the best_mode ; and 3 the917_patent was unenforceable because of consolidateds inequitable_conduct in concealing the best and disclosing a fictitious_mode in the917_patent
the court also 4 held the917_patent unenforceable because consolidateds intentional failure to disclose prior_art constituted inequitable_conduct ; 5 held the081212 and303_patent s unenforceable because of consolidateds` broad_pattern of inequitable_conduct' ; 6 rejected the determinations that the081212 and303_patent s were not invalid and were infringed ; 7 affirmed the dismissal of the antitrust counterclaims ; and 8 vacated the injunction against further_infringement
the district_court adopted all findings of the special_master not specifically rejected

judgment was entered on june_21,_1989
on july_6,_1989 the district_court denied fosecos motion for attorney_fees

issues
1
whether the district_court abused its discretion in holding the917081212 and303_patent s unenforceable

2
whether the district_court erred in holding the inventions claimed in the056 and371 unpatentable under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103

3
whether the district_courts failure to list reasons for its refusal to find this an exceptional_case requires a remand.4

opinion
inequitable conduct renders the917_patent unenforceable
the special_master found that consolidated committed inequitable_conduct by intentionally withholding the best_mode contemplated by the inventors for practicing the invention of the917_patent and by disclosing a fictitious inoperable_mode the evidence shows that the best_mode known at the time of the filing of the917_patent was the` cs1-b' slurry containing aluminum oxide chromium oxide kaolin bentonite aluminum_orthophosphate and water which is later disclosed and claimed in the363_patent
instead of disclosing the actual slurry used to make the filters tested and reported in the patent a fictitious inoperable_slurry was disclosed as example 1 that omitted key ingredients such as the thixotropic clays kaolin bentonite and the aluminum_orthophosphate binder necessary to hold the ceramic together
dr._pryor [ one of the inventors ] admitted that the363_patent represents the undisclosed` best_mode' of the917_patent
the evidence shows that both dr._pryor and dr. gray [ the other inventor ] knew that example 1 of the917_patent was inoperative and not the best_mode and that the` cs1-b' slurry as disclosed in the363_patent was the best_mode used to make the filters that were actually tested as reported in the917_patent
the testimony of dr._pryor also shows that he knew that the` cs1-b' slurry was not going to be disclosed in the application because he instructed the patent attorney mr. bachman to add the sentence at col. 3 ln
39-40` additives may be employed in the slurry such as binders'
inclusion of this sentence would have been unnecessary if the *808` cs1-b' slurry which contained a binder was going to be disclosed
thus the evidence supports the inference that the withholding of the best_mode and inclusion of an unworkable fictitious slurry was intentional
had the examiner known that the best_mode had been withheld the917_patent_application would not have been allowed to issue under the 35 u.s.c.¡± 112
thus the intentional_withholding of the best_mode represents inequitable_conduct in connection with the prosecution of the917
10 uspq2d at 1153

the special_masters conclusions reiterated the intentional_withholding of the best_mode and disclosure of an inoperable_mode
in the case of the917_patent the inventors possessed a specific slurry with known ingredients at known proportions
the917 examples specify a ceramic_slurry but leave actual constituents unnamed and state false proportions for the named constituents
the slurry specified was never used and is inoperable
the ceramic_foam reported in the specification examples was made with the undisclosed slurry
under these circumstances the quality of the917_patent disclosure is so poor as to effectively result in concealment
this concealment was not accidental but was intentional
id.at 1167

the district_court agreed with the masters finding that consolidated not only failed to disclose the best_mode in the917_patent but disclosed a fictitious and inoperable_mode rejected consolidateds argument that failure to disclose the best_mode can not constitute inequitable_conduct,5 and agreed with the master that consolidated had engaged in inequitable_conduct

because disclosure of the best_mode is statutorily required see 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 failure to disclose the best_mode is inherently material and we believe reaches the minimum level of materiality necessary for a finding of inequitable_conduct
see j.p._stevens [ & co. inc. v. lex_tex_ltd. inc. ] 747 f.2d [ 1553 ] 1559 [ 223_uspq_1089 1092 fed.cir.1984 ]
on the other hand since the failure to disclose the best_mode is not excused even if unintentional spectra-physics [ inc. v. coherent inc. ] 827 f.2d [ 1524 ] 1535 [ 3_uspq2d_1737 1745 fed.cir
) cert
denied 484_u.s._954 108_s.ct._346 98_l.ed.2d_372_(1987) ] but inequitable_conduct requires a` threshold' level of intent j.p._stevens 747 f.2d at 1560 [ 223 uspq at 1092 ] the failure to disclose the best_mode will not constitute inequitable_conduct in every case
* * * * * * consolidateds concealment was obviously intentional
an inoperable_slurry was listed on the patent_application although a cited example had been produced with the operable concealed slurry
moreover false proportions were listed for slurry constituents and an intentionally vague statement was made on the application
716 f.supp.at 326 11 uspq2d at 1824-25

consolidated argues that although the district_court found that the` nondisclosure' of the cs1-b_slurry was` intentional' it did not make an express finding of` intent to deceive' and it ignored evidence of subjective good_faith

in so arguing consolidated apparently misunderstands our statement in kingsdown medical consultants ltd. v. hollister inc. 863_f.2d_867 876 9_uspq2d_1384 1392 fed.cir.1988 in banc cert
denied 490_u.s._1067 109_s.ct._2068 104_l.ed.2d_633_(1989) that a finding that particular_conduct amounts to` gross negligence' does not of itself justify an inference of intent to deceive ; the involved_conduct viewed in light of all the evidence including evidence indicative of good_faith must indicate *809 sufficient culpability to require a finding of intent to deceive
kingsdown stands for the proposition that courts must view the involved_conduct` in light of all the evidence' and must then determine whether that conduct in its totality manifests a sufficiently culpable state of mind to warrant a determination that it was inequitable
here the district_court properly made that determination in light of consolidateds intentional_concealment of the cs1-b_slurry and disclosure of a fictitious inoperable_slurry
consolidated does not tell us nor can we discern why a finding of intentional_concealment under the mask of fictitious_mode is not the equal of a finding of intent to deceive
the district_court need not have expressed its determination in the particular phrase` intent to deceive'
see fromson v. western_litho_plate and supply_co. 853_f.2d_1568 1573 7_uspq2d_1606 1611 fed.cir.1988` a district_court need follow no prescribed grammatical formulation in expressing its findings and conclusions
``

consolidateds sole basis for arguing` good_faith' lies in its assertion that the cs1-b_slurry was invented by yarwood dore and preuss and was not disclosed because consolidated properly wished to limit the application for the917_patent to the invention of the named inventors pryor and gray
that argument must fail for it ignores the intentional disclosure of a fictitious inoperable_slurry

the district_court did not abuse its discretion in holding the917_patent unenforceable for inequitable_conduct

unclean hands renders the081212 and303_patent s unenforceable
the district_court concluded that` consolidated engaged in a broad_pattern of inequitable_conduct which was directly related to the 917 081 212_and_303 patents'
as part of its analysis the court applied the unclean_hands_doctrine of keystone_driller co. v. general excavator co. 290_u.s._240 245-46 54_s.ct._146 147-48 78_l.ed._293 19_uspq_228 230 1933 and precision_instrument mfg co. v. automotive maintenance machinery co. 324_u.s._806 815 65_s.ct._993 997-98 89_l.ed._1381 65_uspq_133 138 1945 in holding that consolidateds intentional_concealment of the best_mode and disclosure of a fictitious_inoperable_mode during prosecution of the application for the917_patent so soiled consolidateds hands as to render the081212 and303_patent s equally unenforceable there is a significant relationship between and among the 917 081 212_and_303 patents
`` the081_patent represents the results of tests on the ceramic filters developed by consolidated'
( citations omitted
the tests were conducted with the same concealed cs1-b_slurry
in fact the 081 patent specification notes that` [ t ] he filter material of the present_invention may be prepared in accordance with the general procedure outlined in the aforesaid.. u.s. pat
no._3893,917'

* * * * * * the inequitable_conduct of failing to disclose the best_mode in the 917 patent also significantly affected the 212_and_303 patents continuations of the 081 patent and improvements on the 917 patent
the withheld best_mode of the 917 patent patented in the 363 patent was included in the 212_and_303 patents
in fact the withheld best_mode of the 917 patent was incorporated in the 081 patent which was filed on the same day as the 363 patent_application clearly to avoid the 363 patent_application being cited as prior_art with respect to the 081 patent
moreover as noted above the fact that the slurry was previously withheld in the prior_art was not disclosed to the patent examiner in any of these later applications
716 f.supp.at 331-32 11 uspq2d at 1829

this appeal presents the first instance in which this court is required to consider the equitable maxim` he who comes into equity must come with clean_hands' in determining whether inequitable_conduct in procuring one patent-in-suit requires a holding that other_patents-in-suit are unenforceable
we are not however without guidance
keystone_driller and precision in *810 strument teach us that circumstances may require an affirmative answer to that inquiry

denied 484_u.s._826 108_s.ct._92 98_l.ed.2d_53_(1987)

in keystone_driller the supreme_court affirmed the sixth circuits ruling that all five patents-in-suit were unenforceable due to unclean_hands
the court stated that` courts of equity do not make quality of suitors the test
they apply the maxim requiring clean_hands only where some unconscionable act of one coming for relief has immediate and necessary_relation to the equity that he seeks in respect of the matter in litigation'
id
290 u.s. at 245 54 s.ct.at 147 19 uspq at 230 emphasis added
the court relied on two factors in applying the test for unclean_hands
first the plaintiff had paid a witness in an earlier_suit concerning three of the patents to suppress evidence relating to a prior use of the invention claimed in one
the plaintiff obtained a decree of validity in that earlier case and had relied on that decree to apply for a temporary injunction in the case before the court
second the devices covered by the five patents-in-suit were` important if not essential parts of the same machine'
id.at 246 54 s.ct.at 148 19 uspq at 230
in keystone_driller the court considered the relation of the inequitable_conduct to the equity requested by the plaintiff ; namely enforcement of each of the separate_patents-in-suit
the plaintiff was able to rely on the decree inequitably obtained in the earlier_suit in its attempt to enforce all of the patents in the case before the court
thus the plaintiffs unclean_hands had a direct effect on each of the causes of action for patent infringement for each of the separate_patents asserted by the plaintiff
for that reason all of the patents were unenforceable

likewise in precision_instrument the inequitable_conduct had a direct relation to the requested relief
the court held the three automotive patents-in-suit unenforceable for unclean_hands
the application that led to one of the patents was filed by an employee of defendant precision_instrument
however the alleged_inventor had obtained his information indirectly from automotives inventor named on the other two patents
during the prosecution of the application the patent and trademark office pto declared an interference between one of the automotive applications and the precision_instrument employees application
precision_instruments alleged_inventor filed a false statement concerning the dates of invention
automotive discovered the fraud and the parties settled the interference without notifying the pto of the inequitable_conduct
in the settlement agreements the defendants assigned all of their rights in the patents to automotive and acknowledged the validity of the claims that would issue on the applications
the suit before the court was brought to enforce the agreements and the patents
the court stated that` [ t ] he history of the patents and contracts in issue is steeped in perjury and undisclosed knowledge of perjury'
id
324 u.s. at 816 65 s.ct.at 998 65 uspq at 138
the court followed keystone_driller and determined that automotives inequitable_conduct in not disclosing to the pto the false affidavit impregnated the entire_cause of action and justified dismissal under the unclean_hands_doctrine
id.at 819 65 s.ct.at 999 65 uspq at 139-40
inequitable conduct was present in the patents that were the subjects of the settlement contracts and that conduct related to the entire_cause of action to enforce those contracts

consolidated argues that application of inequitable_conduct considerations to the081212 and303_patent s was an abuse of discretion because mere_relatedness of subject_matter is not a proper basis for such application
in the present case however there is more than mere_relatedness of subject_matter ; the prosecution histories of the patents-in-suit establish that consolidateds inequitable_conduct in prosecuting the917_patent had` immediate and necessary_relation' keystone_driller 290 u.s. at 245 54 s.ct.at 147 19 uspq at 230 to the equity consolidated seeks *811 namely enforcement of the081212 and303_patent s

the917_patent is directed to an improved method of filtering molten_metal
the filter is prepared by impregnating a flexible organic foam_material with an aqueous_ceramic_slurry compressing the foam_material to expel most of the slurry and to uniformly distribute the remaining slurry through the foam_material and drying and heating the coated_foam_material to burn out the foam_material and to sinter the ceramic_slurry coating thereby providing a ceramic filter
claim 1 is representative a low cost method of filtering molten_metal through a disposable filter which comprises providing a mass of molten_metal providing a ceramic_foam_material having an open_cell_structure characterized by a plurality of interconnected voids surrounded by a web of said ceramic said ceramic_foam_material having a density of less than 30 % of the theoretical density for a ceramic material of the same size said ceramic_foam_material being formed by impregnating an open cell flexible organic foam having a plurality of interconnected voids surrounded by a web of said foam with an aqueous_ceramic_slurry so that the web is coated therewith and the voids are filled therewith expelling slurry therefrom while leaving the web coated therewith drying said coated_foam and heating the dried coated_foam to form said ceramic_foam and pouring said molten_metal through said ceramic_foam_material at rate of 5_to_500 cubic inches per square inch of filter area per minute thereby removing entrained solids from said molten_metal
as above indicated the917_patent misstates the composition of the best_mode_cs1-b_slurry which includes alumina chromia kaolin aluminum_orthophosphate water and bentonite
although the917_patent says` [ a ] dditives may be employed in the slurry such as binders' nowhere is bentonite the binder used in the best_mode_cs1-b_slurry disclosed

the081_patent is directed to a molten_metal filter having specified properties of air_permeability porosity pore_size thickness and structural uniformity
claim 1 is representative a ceramic_foam_filter for use in filtering molten_metal having an open_cell_structure characterized by a plurality of interconnected voids surrounded by a web of said ceramic said filter having as air_permeability in the range of 400_to_8000 x 10 -big_token__7_cm_2__big_token a porosity of 0.big_token__80_to_0__big_token95 a pore_size of 5_to_45 pores per linear inch and a thickness of from 1/2 [ to ] 4 inches said filter having substantial structural uniformity with a plurality of homogeneously distributed pore blockages throughout the foam
the properties set forth in claim 1 of the081_patent are the result of using the cs1-b_slurry and claim 1 is supported by the disclosure of the cs1-b_slurry in the081 specification
the concealment of the cs1-b_slurry from the917_patent enabled consolidated to present the cs1-b_slurry as part of the invention disclosure in the081 specification and as a basis for its successful arguments in prosecuting the applications that became the other_patents-in-suit.6

in prosecuting the081_patent_application when the examiner rejected the claims on the917_patent consolidated responded with an argument it could not have made if it had not concealed the cs1-b_slurry i.e. that the917_patent did not suggest or inherently disclose the invention
consolidated went on to say it is also urged that the obtainment of the key characteristics defined in the instant_specification is dependent upon the manner of preparing the filter
this is discussed in some detail in the instant_specification see pages 9_through_14 thereof [ discussing the cs1-b_slurry ] *812 which is clearly not inherently contemplated by the917_patent
at another point consolidated argued to the pto the data set forth in the examples which form a part of the instant_specification are believed to be particularly surprising
see for example table i [ results of using the cs1-b_slurry ] which shows a remarkable improvement obtained in accordance with the present_invention of both unfiltered metal and metal filtered through a tabular alumina bed
the other examples are to the same effect
it is vigorously urged that one skilled in the art would not anticipate such significantly improved results from the917_patent
the key interrelationship of operating variables is believed to be suggested only in the instant_specification and not in the art
( emphasis added

the212 and303 applications were continuations-in-part of the081_patent_application
all claims in both patents include the step of` preparing an aqueous slurry of a thixotropic ceramic composition having a viscosity within the range 1_x_10 3_to_80 x 10 3 cps [ the cs1-b_slurry ]'
responding to a rejection during prosecution of the212_patent_application consolidated argued that a thixotropic ceramic_foam of specific viscosity the cs1-b_slurry` is critical to the successful practice of the present_invention'
( emphasis added7

thus consolidateds concealment of the cs1-b_slurry from the917_patent permeated the prosecution of the other_patents-in-suit and renders them unenforceable.8

consolidated argues that this court in ssih equipment s.a. v. united states int l trade comm n 718_f.2d_365 378 218_uspq_678 690 fed.cir.1983 interpreted precision_instrument and keystone_driller as requiring` fraud before the court'
the argument takes a statement in ssih out of context
as the district_court pointed out the alleged inequitable_conduct in ssih occurred in the prosecution of patents not in suit and was not related to the patent-in-suit which had issued three years before that conduct occurred
consolidateds reading of ssih as requiring fraud before the court would be at odds with precision_instrument which held that withholding information from the pto so soiled the patentees hands as to render all patents-in-suit unenforceable
324 u.s. at 818-19 65 s.ct.at 999 65 uspq at 139-40
moreover we reject consolidateds invitation to limit a flexible doctrine of equity to conduct occurring before a court
see keystone_driller 290 u.s. at 245-46 54 s.ct.at 147-48 19 uspq at 230 unclean_hands is` not bound by formula or restrained by any limitation that tends to trammel the free and just exercise of discretion`
indeed what we have termed` inequitable_conduct' is no more than the unclean_hands_doctrine applied to particular_conduct before the pto
see j.p._stevens_co. 747 f.2d at 1561 223 uspq at 1093
to hold that unclean_hands applies only to conduct before a court would be contrary to our precedent applying the doctrine to conduct before the pto

the prior art renders the056 and371_patent s invalid
the special_master determined that the056 and371_patent s were invalid because the claimed inventions would have been obvious in view of the prior_art
35 u.s.c.¡± 103
agreeing with that determination the district_court rejected consolidateds objection that the special_masters report contained no separate discussion of claim 14 of the056_patent and claim 6 of the371_patent

*813 on appeal consolidated argues that the district_court erred by distilling the invention to a` gist' and disregarding limitations that distinguish it from the prior_art specifically that claim 14 of the056_patent and claim 6 of the371 include a combination of a filter box and a ceramic_foam_filter

we ascertain no error in the district_courts determination that all of the inventions claimed in the056 and371_patent s including claims 14_and_6 thereof respectively would have been obvious
no useful_purpose would be served in retracing the path clearly explicated in the district_courts opinion wherein it properly recognized that` the question under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 iswhether the claimed invention as a whole would have been obvious

exceptional case/attorney_fees
the exceptional_case/attorney_fees scenario in this case is many-sided
neither party sought nor obtained a ruling on the matter from the special_master
consolidated as part of its objections to the masters report sought a finding of exceptional_case and a fee_award to it based on the masters finding that foseco had willfully infringed and on the delaying tactics of foseco including its two new-issue forays rebuffed by a then presiding judge and by the master
the district_court did not comment on consolidateds request in its memorandum_opinion
foseco though it had obtained the masters finding of consolidateds inequitable_conduct in respect of the917_patent did not request a finding of exceptional_case and a fee_award until after the district_courts judgment had been entered and appealed from
consolidateds response was to file a motion to stay action on fosecos motion arguing that the exceptional_case_issue was not ripe for determination because` the prevailing party in this case has now switched' and might switch again after the appeal
thus consolidated sought an exceptional_case_finding and fees when it was the prevailing party on some but not all issues and foseco sought the same after it had become the prevailing party on some but not all issues

in response to fosecos post-judgment motion the district_court amended its opinion to include` in the courts opinion this is not an exceptional_case warranting an award of attorney_fees under 35 u.s.c.¡± 285'
pointing out that inequitable_conduct can be a legally sufficient basis for finding a case exceptional foseco says a remand is necessary to enable the district_court to supply` thorough findings and explanation of whether this is an exceptional_case' and whether foseco should therefore be awarded its attorney_fees
we can not in this case agree that a remand is necessary

in fromson v. western_litho_plate and supply_co. 853_f.2d_1568 1573 7_uspq2d_1606 1611 fed.cir.1988 the district_court found willful_infringement and denied attorney_fees in a single sentence nowhere referring to 35 u.s.c.¡± 285
we there indicated a willingness to attempt discernment of the basis for unexpressed_findings id. but could not do so in that case and were forced to a` regretted remand' because the record was barren of any basis for the district_courts action

in s.c._johnson & son inc. v. carter-wallace inc. 781_f.2d_198 201 228_uspq_367 369 fed.cir.1986 the district_court though it found willful_infringement denied fees because the case was not` exceptional'
because the district_court` offered no findings other than the compelling fact of willful_infringement on which we may base our review of the courts conclusion that this is not an exceptional_case' id. we were forced to remand
we there pointed out that a finding of exceptional_case does not always compel an award of attorney_fees
id

similarly in badalamenti v. dunhams inc. 896_f.2d_1359 1364-65 13_uspq2d_1967 1971-72 fed.cir.1990 because the district_court was silent on the exceptional_case_issue and fee denial we were` unable to review the decision of the district_court on this issue'
recognizing that a remand *814 was` unfortunate' we went on to eschew any suggestion that the case be found exceptional noting that defendants primary basis for requesting fees had disappeared and that even if the case be found exceptional a denial of fees remained discretionary with the district_court

in fromson s.c._johnson and badalamenti we were forced to` regretted' and` unfortunate' remands because we lacked a record on which we might undertake as indicated in fromson a discernment of the basis for unexpressed_findings
a remand with its accompanying expenditure of additional judicial resources in a case thought to be completed is a step not lightly taken and one that should be limited to cases in which further action must be taken by the district_court or in which the appellate_court has no way open to it to affirm or reverse the district_courts action under review.big_token__9_see_9__big_token c. wright a. miller & f. elliott federal practice & procedure ¡± 2577 1971 & supp.1990
though findings on` exceptional_case' and reasons underlying the discretionary action on fees are helpful to an appellate_court remand should not be a matter of rote in every case in which findings and reason are not expressly set forth
an appellate_court need not close its eyes to the record where as in this case there is a way clearly open to affirm the district_courts action

the supreme_court has told us that a party may defend a judgment` on any ground properly raised below' washington v. yakima indian nation 439_u.s._463 476_n._20 99_s.ct._740 749_n._20 58_l.ed.2d_740_(1979) so long as such affirmance would neither expand nor contract the rights established for either party by the judgment appealed from
united states v. new york telephone co. 434_u.s._159 166_n._8 98_s.ct._364 369_n._8 54_l.ed.2d_376_(1987)
the present is such a case for consolidated raised in its motion to stay the ground that both parties had prevailed on some and lost on other issues and our affirmance neither expands nor contracts either partys rights under the judgment appealed from

we have repeatedly noted that when findings are required on the exceptional_case_issue such finding must initially be the province of the district_court
in this particular case however such initial findings are not required where as here the record is replete with undisputed_facts that unequivocally support the district_courts action in denying fosecos motion
see c. wright supra
foseco the seeker of an exceptional_case_finding and attorney_fees was adjudicated a willful infringer after trial before the special_master its repeated late efforts to add claims requiring delays for further discovery had been rebuffed by a presiding judge and the master and the district_court affirmed the masters dismissal of its antitrust counterclaim
consolidated prevailed at trial before the master on validity of eight claims in three patents on infringement on willfulness and on its injunction request and prevailed before the master and the district_court on its antitrust defense.10 neither party can nor does claim that it prevailed on all issues at all stages

it would be but a wasteful and fruitless exercise to remand so the district_court could point out to us the undisputed_facts listed above and remind us that inequitable_conduct alone need not compel a finding that the case is exceptional citing perhaps j.p._stevens_co. inc. v. lex_tex_ltd. 822_f.2d_1047 1052 3_uspq2d_1235 1239 fed.cir.1987 and a.b
dick co. v. burroughs corp. 798_f.2d_1392 1400_n._11 230_uspq_849 856_n._11_(fed.cir.1986) case exceptional but fees denied where plaintiff prevailed on some issues

if it were needed a further reason exists for declining to exercise our power to remand in this case
the district_court *815 did not here find the case` not exceptional'
what the district_court found is that this is` not an exceptional_case warranting an award of attorney_fees'
that statement reflects the courts exercise of its discretion in light of all the undisputed_facts listed above
moreover it accords with our repeated statement that not every case deemed` exceptional' must result in a fee_award
see e.g. s.c._johnson & son 781 f.2d at 201 228 uspq at 369 ; badalamenti 896 f.2d at 1365 13 uspq2d at 1972
no useful_purpose would be served by a remand to enable the district_court to tell us in express terms what we already know from the record
nor is it necessary in this case to ask the district_court to` explain' why in its discretion it denied attorney_fees when unlike the circumstances in fromson s.c._johnson and badalamenti the present record supplies no basis for questioning that exercise of discretion
on the entirety of this record we can not say that the district_courts denial of fosecos motion for attorney_fees constituted an abuse of discretion

attorney_fees on appeal
because the appeal is clearly not frivolous fosecos request for attorney_fees on appeal is denied

affirmed
