opinion
clevenger circuit_judge
atlantic_paste & glue_company inc. atlantic appeals the judgment of the united_states_district_court for the eastern_district of new_york holding that j.t
eaton & company inc.s eaton patent for a mousetrap is not invalid and is infringed by atlantics accused mousetraps

for the reasons set forth below we conclude that the district_court misinterpreted claim 1 of eatons patent
consequently we reverse the judgment that the patent is infringed and we vacate the judgment that the patent is not invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 1994
the case is remanded to the district_court for further_proceedings with regard to the validity issue

i
this suit involves united states patent no._4438,584 the584_patent issued on march_27,_1984 to stanley z. baker and benjamin h. baker
the patent assigned to eaton discloses a` trap for rats mice and other vermin'
claim 1 the patents only independent claim reads with emphasis added a commercial_trap_product for catching mice or rats comprised of a generally flat support formed of a non-porous thin sheet material said support having at least one positioning surface at least one indented portion having a given depth below said positioning surface and a relatively thick layer of pressure_sensitive_adhesive_material contained within said indented portion having a thickness of at least 1/16 inch a plastic_flow_temperature above 120¢X > f. and an upper surface ; said indented portion having a greater depth than the thickness of said layer of adhesive and said positioning surface being spaced above said adhesive layer upper surface

claim 1 thus recites a dishlike container holding a pressure_sensitive_adhesive_material in which vermin become stuck and thereby trapped
the commercial embodiments of the invention feature two plastic containers or traps typically packaged together one *1565 on top of the other face-to-face capable of being hung in a vertical_position at the point of sale

after a bench_trial the district_court issued findings of fact and conclusions of law in which it interpreted the limitation` a plastic_flow_temperature above 120¢Xf'
based on its interpretation atlantics accused product was found to infringe claim 1
additionally the district_court held claim 1 not invalid under ¡± 103 for obviousness or under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b 1994 for having been on sale for more than one year before the filing date of the584_patent
for the reasons set forth in the opinion of the district_court we hold that on the facts presented in this case claim 1 is not invalid under ¡± 102 b and we thus refer no further to that issue

whether claim 1 is infringed by atlantics accused product and whether eatons commercially successful_product is an embodiment of the invention claimed the latter being germane in this case to the validity of the patent under ¡± 103 depend on what is meant by` a plastic_flow_temperature above 120¢Xf'
as we will explain below the correct meaning of that term is established by reading the prosecution_history of the584_patent
that is a legal exercise which we are obligated to conduct independently
markman v. westview_instruments inc. 52_f.3d_967 979 34_uspq2d_1321 1329 fed.cir.1995 affd 517_u.s._370 116_s.ct._1384 134_l.ed.2d_577_(1996)

ii
the district_court construed the limitation` a plastic_flow_temperature above 120¢Xf' with reference to the claimed adhesive to mean [ t ] hat the adhesive has a flow characteristic which enables the trap_product to be shipped and stored at the highest_ambient_temperature expected to be encountered in connection with such shipping and storage namely 120¢X > f without the adhesive flowing from the support
a pressure_sensitive_adhesive_material in a trap for catching mice or rats in accordance with the invention in eatons584_patent has a plastic_flow_temperature above 120¢Xf if the adhesive passes the two tests established by mr. kenneth_a._nelson.. namely 1 disposing a support such as a tray and the adhesive therein in an inverted horizontal_orientation on an underlying substrate and exposing the support and adhesive to a temperature of 120¢Xf for sixteen 16 hours and 2 disposing a support such as a tray and the adhesive therein in a vertical_orientation on an underlying substrate and exposing the support and adhesive to a temperature of 77¢X > f for sixty-three 63 hours
an adhesive passes these tests and has a plastic_flow_temperature above 120¢Xf if the adhesive does not flow from the support onto the underlying substrate during the test
these two tests are set forth in the file_history of eatons584_patent

in addition the district_court cited another test to determine if an adhesive has a plastic_flow_temperature above 120¢Xf
that test devised by findley_adhesives inc. called for heating the adhesive to 250¢Xf for one-half hour allowing the adhesive to set at room_temperature for 24 hours then disposing the adhesive in an inverted horizontal_orientation at a temperature of 120¢Xf for 16 hours
with regard to those tests the district_court held that the two tests devised by mr._nelson and the test procedure established by findley_adhesives inc. are appropriate for determining that an adhesive has a plastic_flow_temperature of 120¢Xf in accordance with the invention claimed in the584_patent

based on undisputed testimony offered by eaton atlantics mousetraps-when subjected to these tests-were found to infringe claim 1
as we will explain below however these tests can not as a matter of law be the measurement for determining if an adhesive meets the plastic_flow_temperature limitation of claim 1 because the tests do not measure plastic_flow at 120¢Xf in a vertical_orientation which is required when the claim is properly construed

after a thorough analysis of the prior_art the district_court found the` primary indicia of patentability.. lacking' *1566 ashland oil inc. v. delta resins & refractories inc. 776_f.2d_281 306 227_uspq_657 675 fed.cir.1985 for claim 1 and that the claim would have been obvious when viewed in the light of the prior_art and the level of skill in the art
nevertheless the district_court held the patent nonobvious because of the strong commercial_success of eatons commercial_product
the finding of commercial_success was based on eatons $ 17 million of sales from 1979_through_1984 and its $ 4 million of annual sales from 1985_through_1989

iii
the584_patent emerged from claims originally set forth in patent application no._338621 which is a continuation of ser
no._53381 filed on june_29,_1979
the examiner rejected the claims inter alia for failure to disclose the best_mode of making the invention
the nelson_tests used by the district_court as the measurement of plastic_flow_temperature assessed prior_art_adhesives and an adhesive which nelsons employer findley_adhesives had been requested by eaton to prepare that would meet the limitations of claim 1
even though eaton had expressly directed nelson to test the adhesives for plastic_flow at 120¢Xf in an orientation other than horizontal nelsons test_results did not refer to any tests or test_results at 120¢X > f in a vertical_orientation
instead the only 120¢Xf test performed by nelson was on adhesive in a horizontal_orientation
nelsons tests for plastic_flow in a vertical_position at 77¢Xf were unrelated to the 120¢Xf plastic_flow limitation in the621 application and were not requested by the performance specifications supplied to nelson by eaton
the results of nelsons tests as well as his test_protocols were introduced by the applicants to overcome the best_mode rejection and to show that prior_art_adhesives failed to meet the nelson_tests

the examiner however was troubled by the information disclosed in the nelson_tests
in particular the examiner noted that one of the prior_art adhesive traps tested by nelson anticipated the claims under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 1994
accordingly the examiner requested additional_tests by nelson from the applicants to overcome the rejection
eatons attorney communicated the examiners concerns to nelson by letter dated november 6 1981 which was introduced at trial on the public_record as defendants nonprivileged exhibit 197
in that letter nelson was instructed by eatons counsel to perform additional_tests on the prior_art adhesive
in particular the attorney noted the need for a 120¢Xf test with the adhesive vertically oriented
the attorney recommended a vertical 120¢Xf test` for a period of a day or several_days'
whether nelson performed the particular vertical_tests requested by eatons attorney is unknown and the prosecution_history of the584_patent contains no reference to the results of such vertical_tests
the examiner rejected the claims for failure to disclose best_mode nonenablement of the adhesive and obviousness over the prior_art

on appeal to the board of appeals of the u.s. patent and trademark_office board the claims were held not prima_facie obvious over the prior_art and in any event not obvious because of the commercial_success of eatons products
the applicants in their brief to the board stated that the adhesive claimed must not flow when exposed to 120¢Xf in vertical_orientation even for unlimited_periods of time
the requirement that the claimed adhesive not flow when exposed to 120¢Xf in a vertical_orientation had been noted several times during prosecution up to the filing of the applicants brief to the board and the same point was emphasized throughout subsequent prosecution proceedings
for example the applicants stated in their brief to the board also importantly the adhesive must have temperature-flow_characteristics such that even if the surface of the adhesive is vertical the adhesive will not flow or sag at ordinarily encountered ambient storage temperatures less than 120¢Xf
that is to say the plastic_flow_temperature of the adhesive must be above 120¢Xf
[ emphasis added ]
on another occasion in its statement to the patent_office dated november 19 1985 the applicant distinguished prior_art references on the basis that nowhere in any of these references is there any mention whatsoever of a body of adhesive having a particular plastic_flow *1567 temperature which enables a vermin trap to be shipped and stored in positions other than horizontal at the highest_ambient_temperature expected to be encountered in connection with such shipment and storage without the body of adhesive running from the support therefor
[ emphasis added ]

in sum the prosecution_history abounds with unambiguous declarations by the applicants that their claimed traps would reasonably be exposed to 120¢X > f when vertically oriented
that history is consistent with the evidence introduced at trial showing eatons repeated efforts to test adhesives at 120¢Xf in vertical_orientations and refutes any notion that eatons only vertical_flow concerns were satisfied by nelsons 77¢Xf vertical_test
however despite the applicants repeated emphasis on the requirement that the adhesive not flow when exposed to 120¢Xf in a vertical_orientation the file_history contained no reference to any vertical_test at 120¢Xf when the584_patent issued on march_27,_1984

in july of 1985 a request for reexamination was filed by hampton_chemical inc. based on several prior_art references not previously considered by the examiner or the board
for purposes of our review two items of the prior_art are of concern two u.k._patents disclosing an adhesive in a mousetrap and a domestic adhesive product formula 31 which were said to render obvious the mousetrap claimed in the584_patent

iv
when the patent was subjected to reexamination the applicants hampton_chemical and the examiner knew that the invention as claimed specified that the adhesive not flow when exposed to 120¢Xf in any orientation including vertical
however before the reexamination_proceedings no reference had been made in the file_history to any test of plastic_flow at 120¢Xf when the material is vertically oriented
all previous references to plastic_flow in a vertical_orientation were with respect to relatively long-term exposure at ambient room_temperatures
in particular the earlier references to vertical plastic_flow cited the nelson_tests which exposed the adhesive to 77¢Xf for 63 hours
the concern over possible flow at room_temperature after exposure for several_days stemmed from the inventors understanding that at commercial points of sale the packaged traps might remain suspended vertically for such times
the 77¢Xf test while of interest to the inventors for shelf life marketability of their product is irrelevant to the determination of whether an adhesive will flow when exposed to 120¢Xf for any period of time
in short claim 1 of the584_patent can not be enforced against a mousetrap_product with an adhesive which passes nelsons 77¢Xf vertical_test but which fails the 120¢Xf test
nor can a product which passes the 77¢Xf test but which fails the 120¢Xf limitation be used to demonstrate commercial_success of the invention as part of a defense to legal challenge under ¡± 103

before reexamination a competitor of eaton wishing to avoid infringement of claim 1 would not have known how to test his product to determine if it satisfied the 120¢Xf limitation when the adhesive is vertically oriented
indeed such a competitor southern mill creek productions company inc. had already appeared in protest to the application before the patent issued complaining that` nowhere in the confines of this application have applicants defined how one might measure the flow temperature of the pressure-sensitive adhesive material'
the applicants however took no steps to disclose a test_protocol for measuring plastic_flow at 120¢X_f in a vertical_orientation
the record in this case reflects that eaton learned in 1983 while southern mills complaint was pending and before issuance of the patent that its own_product failed the 120¢Xf flow test when exposed vertically for 16 hours
we do not know however whether that fact affected eatons failure to disclose a 120¢Xf vertical_test_protocol to the examiner

v. during reexamination hampton_chemical sought to prove that eatons claimed mousetrap employing a special adhesive was rendered obvious in view of the two u.k._patents and formula 31
to make its case hampton employed one of ordinary_skill in the art donatas_satas to test the adhesive *1568 disclosed in the u.k._patents
satas selected the test_protocol for the 120¢Xf limitation and determined that the adhesive should be tested for flow at 120¢Xf for 24 hours in a vertical_orientation and for 12 hours at 120¢Xf in an inverted horizontal_orientation
satas concluded that the prior_art_adhesives so tested met the limitations of claim 1

eaton also in the reexamination sought to prove that formula 31 did not meet the limitations of claim 1
toward that end eaton hired john_m._questel also one of ordinary_skill in the art to test formula 31
questels tests were performed under his supervision by his employee lore hise
the test_protocol selected by questel exposed the adhesive to 120¢Xf for 24 hours in both horizontal and vertical_orientations
questel concluded that formula 31 did not meet the limitations of the claim and that he lacked sufficient information to comment-one way or another-on the conclusion reached by donatas_satas on the adhesive disclosed in the u.k._patents

on march_10,_1986 the examiner rejected the claims on reexamination as obvious under ¡± 103 over the references brought to the examiners attention by hampton_chemical
eaton responded to that rejection arguing that questels tests had shown formula 31 not to be invalidating prior_art and that satass test_results were inconclusive
in its response eaton relied on the questel_tests and notably did not question the propriety of the test_protocols employed by satas
from this episode in the file_history of the584_patent a reasonable competitor of eaton would surmise that eaton would measure satisfaction of` a plastic_flow_temperature above 120¢Xf' by testing accused adhesives at 120¢Xf for 24 hours in both vertical and horizontal_orientations
in short after seven years of patent application prosecution the file_history clearly supplied the missing vertical 120¢X_f_test parameter and a corresponding horizontal test

vi
the final_chapter of the file_history of the584_patent is the second_appeal to the board following another rejection of the claims by the examiner as obvious over the prior_art including the u.k._patents and formula 31
both eaton and the examiner again relied on the questel_tests with eaton arguing the tests showed that the prior_art failed to meet the 120¢Xf claim limitation and the examiner arguing that the tests showed the prior_art met the limitation
the board during the course of its detailed review of the prior_art relied on the 24-hour parameter in the questel_tests in concluding that the adhesive in formula 31 met the 120¢Xf limitation
in light of the prior_art the board concluded that the claims are prima_facie obvious but that the claims are nevertheless nonobvious under ¡± 103 because of the commercial_success of eatons product as demonstrated to the board by eatons submission of sales data and consumer testimonials
during this final_chapter of the prosecution_history neither eaton the examiner nor the board referred to the then-ancient nelson_tests as the protocol for ascertaining the meaning of the 120¢Xf claim limitation
instead there was unanimous recognition that the questel test_protocols were understood by one of ordinary_skill in the art to define the 120¢Xf claim limitation

vii
we now turn to the events at trial in the district_court
both eaton and atlantic offered testimony through expert_witnesses about the meaning of the 120¢Xf claim limitation
`` plastic_flow_temperature above 120¢X > f' is a term with no previous meaning to those of ordinary_skill in the art
its meaning then must be found somewhere in the patent
see 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
2 1994 inventor must particularly point out and distinctly claim the subject matter of his invention ; in re paulsen 30_f.3d_1475 1480 31_uspq2d_1671 1674 fed.cir.1994 inventor as lexicographer must define his terms in the patent disclosure
both expert_witnesses understood that the adhesive in claim 1 had to withstand plastic_flow at 120¢X_f when subjected to horizontal and vertical_tests
both witnesses also understood that the claim prohibits plastic_flow at 120¢Xf after the adhesive has been exposed to the specified degree of heat for such reasonable periods of time as *1569 the commercial_product might experience during shipping and storage

the experts however disagreed over the length of time that the patented product might remain exposed to 120¢Xf during shipping and storage
eatons expert richard muny testified regarding adhesive tests that he had been asked to run on eatons products and the accused products of atlantic
muny testified that he took no part in selecting the test_protocols ; instead he simply ran his tests using protocols given to him by findley_adhesives at the direction of eaton
the tests used by muny were those devised by nelson horizontal at 120¢Xf for 16 hours and vertical at 77¢Xf for 63 hours plus a vertical_test at 120¢Xf for 5 hours
muny did not explain why he was asked to conduct the 120¢Xf vertical_test
muny also testified that it might go` too far' to describe these findley tests as standard quality control procedure
muny however testified that in his opinion the tests he had been asked to run reflected the time periods during which the products might be expected to be exposed to 120¢Xf when in shipment or storage

dr. harold zeliger testified that he had been retained by atlantic to devise and carry out tests to demonstrate whether the products of eaton and atlantic met the limitations of claim 1
zeliger read claim 1 to require the adhesive to resist plastic_flow when exposed to 120¢Xf in a vertical_orientation
zeliger did not state whether he tested any product for plastic_flow when in a horizontal_orientation
his tests exposed six commercial_products of both eaton and atlantic to 120¢Xf vertically oriented in their packages of two trays facing one another
zeliger periodically examined the products being tested to determine if they had experienced plastic_flow
zeliger concluded that an adhesive` failed' when the adhesive in the two trays flowed into each other
according to zeligers tests two of eatons products resisted plastic_flow for 44 hours but the other four eaton products` failed' or flowed one after 11 hours and the other three after 20 hours
of atlantics accused products one failed after 24 hours three failed after 11 hours and two failed after 20 hours

zeliger testified that in his view all of the products of eaton and atlantic failed during times he considered reasonable_times when the adhesives would be exposed to 120¢Xf during shipping and storage
zeliger expressly disagreed with munys conclusion that five hours of exposure at 120¢Xf was the reasonable maximum exposure time
zeliger testified that a five-hour time limit was not indicative of real_world_conditions
on cross-examination zeliger admitted that in real_world_conditions one would not find exact temperatures of 120¢Xf maintained evenly over periods of time
zeliger thus cast some doubt on his own tests as effective measurements of actual shipping and storage conditions

after hearing all the testimony the district_court rejected zeligers view that infringement of claim 1 should be measured by the length of time required for the adhesive in the trap to flow when exposed to 120¢Xf in a vertical_position
the district_court also rejected the portion of munys tests that had subjected atlantics traps to 120¢Xf in a vertical_orientation for five hours
instead the district_court held that nelsons tests as conducted by muny proved that atlantics product infringed claim 1
for the reasons explained above the district_courts reliance on the nelson_tests is legal error since those tests fail to subject the claimed adhesive to 120¢Xf when vertically oriented

if muny is correct that his five-hour_vertical_test and a 16-hour horizontal test satisfy claim 1 atlantics accused product would infringe claim 1 because atlantic apparently concedes the 16-hour 120¢Xf horizontal measurement and zeliger proves that at least some of atlantics product survives for five hours when tested vertically
if however zeliger is correct that the reasonable_times for exposure at 120¢Xf can vary and that his failure times are all within a zone of reasonable exposure times then none of atlantics product infringes claim 1
eatons own_product also would not meet the limitations of claim 1 and eaton would thus be unable to claim commercial_success of that product to establish that claim 1 is not obvious under ¡± 103

*1570 we may not rely on either muny or zeliger because as we have often stated trial testimony regarding the meaning of a claim can not vary the meaning of a claim that is established either by the claim itself or by the claim as correctly understood by reference to the specification and the file_history
see senmed inc. v. richard-allen medical indus. inc. 888_f.2d_815 819_n._8 12_uspq2d_1508 1512_n._8_(fed.cir.1989) ; see also north am vaccine inc. v. american cyanamid co. 7_f.3d_1571 1577 28_uspq2d_1333 1337 fed.cir.1993 patentee can not take one position before the patent_office and a different position before the court ; jonsson v. stanley works 903_f.2d_812 820-21 14_uspq2d_1863 1871 fed.cir.1990 same

for the reasons set forth above we have concluded that the district_court erred as a matter of law when it construed the term` a plastic_flow_temperature above 120¢Xf' to exclude any amount of plastic_flow when the adhesive is exposed to 120¢Xf in a vertical_orientation
the 120¢Xf vertical_tests proposed by muny and zeliger are also legally insufficient ; munys because it sets the time for horizontal and vertical_testing incorrectly and zeligers because it sets no times for testing but simply tests until failure and then asks if the time to failure is within reasonable real world exposure times
while zeligers test may have some common sense appeal it provides no certainty to eatons competitors who are entitled to know the point in time at which their products will infringe claim 1
nor does zeligers test give any measure of certainty to eaton which is also entitled to know in advance how to test competing product for infringement of claim 1

in this case the dispositive claim limitation is a term unknown to those of ordinary_skill in the art at the time the patent application was filed
it thus fell to the applicants as a duty to provide a precise definition for the 120¢Xf limitation
early in the prosecution_history of the584_patent a competitor noted the absence of any definition of the key term
the applicants proffer of the nelson_tests did not respond properly to the competitors plea because the nelson_tests failed to supply a test parameter for flow at 120¢Xf when the adhesive is vertically oriented
the record in this case amply demonstrates that the applicants intended their adhesive to withstand plastic_flow at 120¢Xf when vertically oriented
their disclosures to the examiner repeatedly stated that intention as did their testing of products demonstrated by evidence submitted at trial for flow at 120¢Xf when vertically oriented
the applicants were obligated to give a meaning to the key limitation during the prosecution_history and they did so with the questel_tests

viii
having concluded that` a plastic_flow_temperature above 120¢Xf' means that the adhesive must resist flow when exposed for 24 hours to 120¢X > f in both horizontal and vertical_orientations we now review the holdings of the district_court that atlantics accused products infringe claim 1 and that the claims of the584_patent are not invalid as obvious under ¡± 103

a. zeligers tests on atlantics product prove that at least one such product resisted plastic_flow when exposed for 24 hours to 120¢Xf in a vertical_orientation
there is no proof in the zeliger_tests however that the same product resisted plastic_flow when exposed to 120¢Xf for 24 hours in a horizontal_orientation
the zeliger_tests thus can not serve as the factual basis to demonstrate that atlantics product infringes claim 1 as correctly interpreted
the burden rested with eaton throughout the trial to prove that atlantics mousetraps met each limitation in claim 1
eaton knew from at least the final_chapter of the prosecution_history that its claim required the adhesive to resist plastic_flow when subjected to 120¢X_f in both vertical and horizontal_orientations
instead of testing atlantics product for infringement under the protocols disclosed in the prosecution_history eaton erroneously sought to make its case on the basis of nelsons 16-hour horizontal test and the 5-hour_vertical_test run by muny
having reviewed the trial_record and found no evidence that atlantics product meets the 120¢X_f_limitation as correctly *1571 interpreted we have no choice but to reverse the district_courts judgment of infringement

b
whether eaton could succeed on its claim of infringement by atlantic also depends on whether it can overcome atlantics challenge to the validity of the584_patent
as noted above the district_court concluded that the584_patent would have been invalid as obvious under ¡± 103 but for the commercial_success that eatons products have enjoyed since their introduction to the marketplace
the district_court carefully reviewed the prior_art pursuant to which it reached that conclusion
that review repeated the review conducted by the board in the second_appeal at the conclusion of which the board also determined that but for the commercial_success the claims in suit would have been invalid for obviousness
we need not repeat for a third time the analysis of the prior_art with which we agree
the only pertinent issue under ¡± 103 is whether the evidence of commercial_success introduced at trial is legally sufficient to support the conclusion of the district_court that the584_patent would not have been obvious under ¡± 103

just as no product can infringe claim 1 unless the product resists plastic_flow when exposed vertically and horizontally at 120¢X_f for 24 hours eaton can not demonstrate commercial_success for purposes of countering the challenge of obviousness unless it can show that the commercial_success of the product results from the claimed invention
furthermore the asserted commercial_success of the product must be due to the merits of the claimed invention beyond what was readily available in the prior_art
richdel inc. v. sunspool corp. 714_f.2d_1573 1580 219_uspq_8 12 fed.cir.1983 claims held obvious despite purported showing of commercial_success when patentee failed to show that` such commercial_success as its marketed system enjoyed was due to anything disclosed in the patent in suit which was not readily available in the prior_art'
when a patentee can demonstrate commercial_success usually shown by significant_sales in a relevant market and that the successful_product is the invention disclosed and claimed in the patent it is presumed that the commercial_success is due to the patented_invention
demaco corp. v. f. von langsdorff licensing ltd. 851_f.2d_1387 1392-93 7_uspq2d_1222 1226-27 fed.cir.1988
if a patentee makes the requisite showing of nexus between commercial_success and the patented_invention the burden shifts to the challenger to prove that the commercial_success is instead due to other factors extraneous to the patented_invention such as advertising or superior workmanship

at trial atlantic argued that eatons evidence of commercial_success is legally insufficient and therefore that the584_patent is invalid for obviousness
the district_court correctly noted that eaton carries the burden of demonstrating that the` thing.. that is commercially successful is the invention disclosed and claimed in the patent'
demaco 851 f.2d at 1392 7 uspq2d at 1226
the significant_sales of eatons` stick-em' glue_traps were held by the district_court to establish the requisite nexus because the adhesive` does not flow out of the trap but stays put to catch the vermin'
in this case eatons primary showing of commercial_success seems limited to the sales of the stick-em product which satisfied the nelson_tests
because the nelson_tests do not correctly define the 120¢Xf limitation in claim 1 they can not serve to assist eaton in making its nexus case
zeligers tests however suggest that certain of eatons products may embody the claimed invention and for that reason we conclude that the issue of nexus should be reexamined on remand
if eaton can demonstrate that the commercial_success of its product derives from the claimed invention and is attributable to something disclosed in the patent that was not readily available in the prior_art it is entitled on the record in this case to the presumption that the commercial_success of its product is attributable to its patented_invention

at trial the district_court held that the volume of eatons sales satisfied the requirements to show commercial_success
the district_court also rejected the reasons advanced by atlantic to prove that the commercial_success was due to advertising and other *1572 factors instead of resulting from the patented_invention
we agree with the district_court in these respects and affirm its decision that the sales evidence in this case shows success and that atlantics other explanations of success can not overcome a properly grounded presumptive showing of nexus between the commercial_success and the claimed invention
we disturb only the holding that eaton proved a presumptive nexus between the sales of its product and the invention claimed

on remand eaton will have an opportunity to renew its assertion that the commercial_success of its product as shown by the evidence introduced at trial demonstrates the lack of obviousness of the584_patent
atlantic will have a corresponding opportunity to challenge eatons renewed assertion

ix
based on the correct interpretation of claim 1 the judgment of infringement is reversed and the judgment that the584_patent is not invalid under ¡± 103 is vacated
the case is remanded to the district_court

two inventors at j.t
eaton & company inc. eaton built a better_mousetrap and as promised in the old adage * the world beat a path to their door
in an effort to reap its rightful reward for advancing the state of the art eaton surmounted extensive legal hurdles
eaton persevered through eight years of patent_prosecution in the patent and trademark_office pto
after a competitor protest two reexamination_proceedings and two appeals the board of patent_appeals and interferences board twice confirmed the patentability of eatons invention
thereafter eaton spent twelve years in district_court proceedings ultimately winning a judgment of infringement against its competitor atlantic_paste & glue_company inc. atlantic
all this effort however came to naught when this court concocted its own novel interpretation of the lengthy prosecution_history of eatons patent
based on its reading of the administrative_record this court arrives at a claim_interpretation that no party advocated throughout the protracted history of this patent and is likely to cover neither eatons nor atlantics products

to reach its idiosyncratic claim_interpretation this court relies on a few isolated excerpts from over 1400 pages of prosecution_history
in particular this court abstracts two paragraphs from an eleven-page declaration of john_m._questel filed in the second_reexamination to convert a stringent_vertical_flow_test into a claim_requirement
in fact neither eaton nor the board nor even mr._questel himself relied on his 120¢Xf vertical_flow test to distinguish prior_art
the administrative_record when considered as a whole does not support this courts adoption of this test as the measure of eatons claims

this court need not have strained to interpret the claims
the patent record-the claims specification and prosecution_history-provides ample support for the claim_interpretation adopted by the united_states_district_court for the eastern_district of new_york
in fact the examiner the board and at least two federal judges have already accepted the same_interpretation-a reading *1573 compelled by the prosecution_history as a whole

i
the phrase` plastic_flow_temperature' has no fixed meaning in the adhesive art
however an inventor may freely define unfamiliar claim_terms in the specification or in the prosecution_history
see vitronics corp. v. conceptronic inc. 90_f.3d_1576 1582 39_uspq2d_1573 1576 fed.cir.1996 ; lear siegler inc. v. aeroquip corp. 733_f.2d_881 889-90 221_uspq_1025 1031 fed.cir.1984
eaton took that course to define its claim_term

eatons patent no._4438,584 the584_patent distinguished its ready-to-use glue trap for mice and rats from the prior_art with an adhesive having a` plastic_flow_temperature above 120¢Xf'
the inventors stanley and benjamin baker recognized that the adhesives used in prior_art traps would melt and flow at temperatures normally encountered during shipping and storage
the bakers learned from the united states department of transportation that the maximum ambient temperature encountered during shipping was 120¢Xf
to solve the problem with the prior_art the bakers set out to stabilize their adhesive at temperatures up to 120¢Xf
thus the requirements of secure shipping became the benchmark for` plastic_flow_temperature'

throughout the lengthy administrative proceedings eaton and the pto clarified this meaning of plastic_flow_temperature
for example in its amendment filed july_24,_1981 eaton explained [ b ] ecause the plastic_flow_temperature is above 120¢Xf the body of the adhesive will not flow plastically at normally encountered ambient temperatures while being shipped or stored
the traps can be disposed horizontally upside down or vertically at normally encountered temperatures with no fear of touching of adjacent_surfaces or the adhesive of one trap to the other
thus eaton explained that its claimed adhesive would not flow upside-down or` vertically at normally encountered temperatures'

to underscore this message eaton submitted the declaration of kenneth_a._nelson the chemist who developed the claimed adhesive
mr._nelsons declaration disclosed a two-prong_test for the claim_requirement
that test requires first placing a 1/16 inch layer of adhesive upside-down in an oven preheated to 120¢Xf for sixteen hours
second the test requires that the adhesive be hung vertically in an oven at 77¢Xf for sixty-three hours
an adhesive meets eatons requirement if the glue does not flow from the tray during either of these tests

the board understood and accepted this specific definition of plastic_flow_temperature
in its november 30 1983 opinion the board recognized` plastic_flow_temperature' as the` characteristic of the adhesive.. required to prevent the adhesive from flowing or sagging at temperatures at which the trap is shipped stored or used'
the board noted that prior_art publications did not anticipate eatons claims because they lacked adhesives with these plastic_flow properties prior to the instant invention glue_traps were prepared by the user rather than the manufacturer in that ready made traps could not be readily shipped and stored
workers in this art were working to find various means to solve these problems
appellants recognized this problem and conceived of the idea embodied in the instant claims of utilizing an adhesive having special plastic_flow properties

thus the full administrative_record gives an explicit and reasonable meaning of` plastic_flow_temperature' that focuses on shipping and storage of the commercial_trap_product without adhesive spillage
mr._nelsons two-prong_test makes eatons definition unmistakable to one of skill in the art
for this reason the eastern_district of new_york adopted the nelson_tests as the definition of` plastic_flow_temperature'
indeed another district_court interpreted` plastic_flow_temperature' in the same584_patent precisely in accordance with mr._nelsons declaration
see j.t
eaton & co. v. bell lab. inc. no._95- c-0441-s w.d.wis
march_29,_1996 oral jury instructions
thus the examiner the board twice and *1574 two district_courts read the plastic_flow limitation in accordance with the nelson_tests

trial testimony from one skilled in the art confirmed the logic of this uniform claim_interpretation
according to this testimony mr._nelsons sixteen hour inverted horizontal test at 120¢Xf properly tested the product under typical shipping conditions
after all elevated temperatures would not last longer than normal daylight hours
testing the adhesives beyond sixteen hours made little sense in the context of shipping these products in trucks and boxcars
likewise according to the same testimony the lengthy vertical_test at 77¢Xf properly reflected the prolonged periods of shelf storage at normal room_temperatures
given this logical explanation there is little wonder every other agency and court that reviewed eatons claims accepted the same_interpretation

ii
despite the overall content of the prosecution_history this court stretched the vertical_flow test concept out of proportion exaggerated the stringency of that test beyond the realities of storage and shipping and made it the sole talisman of the eaton claim
in its brief atlantic urged this court to find a stringent_vertical_flow_test in a single sentence of the voluminous prosecution_history plastic_flow_temperature as used herein is that temperature below which the adhesive will not flow or sag even if stored with the surface of a thick 1/big_token__16_to_1__big_token /8 inch layer of adhesive vertical for unlimited_periods of time
( applicants brief to board of patent_appeals and interferences december 27 1982 based on this statement atlantic argued that an accused trap_product could not infringe unless it could dangle in a vertical_position at 120¢Xf for an infinite period of time without any glue flow
like the district_court before it however this court recognized that one skilled in the art could not reasonably rely on such obvious hyperbole as if it affected the scope of the claim
see intervet am. inc. v. kee-vet lab. inc. 887_f.2d_1050 1054 12_uspq2d_1474 1477 fed.cir.1989 holding that claim language controls over an attorneys` erroneous remarks' made during the course of prosecution
accordingly the panel rejected this rationale
in so doing it rejected the only claim_interpretation proffered by atlantic for` plastic_flow_temperature'

without any basis in argument from either party or testimony from the trial_record the panels ultimate claim_construction rests on its own collection of orphaned passages from the file_history
according to the panel these passages show that eaton did not provide a test for measuring vertical_flow
to the contrary eaton provided mr._nelsons 77¢Xf vertical_test-a test designed for temperatures where the products are likely to hang on vertical displays
nonetheless this court created the myth of a` missing vertical_test' to justify its reliance on two paragraphs in mr._questels declaration paragraphs 22_and_23 -a declaration filed two years after the584_patent originally issued

this courts reading of the record goes astray in several ways
first nowhere does the584_patent_prosecution suggest the necessity of a 120¢X > f vertical_flow test
the` missing' test was not missing at all but was simply not required by the claims
before the pto eaton consistently stressed that the nelson_tests defined` plastic_flow_temperature' under temperature conditions likely to be encountered during shipping and storage
second the brief extract from mr._questels declaration simply lacks the meaning and the importance attributed to it by the panel

a
the premise underlying this courts opinion is that mr._questel supplied a missing test for vertical_flow two years after the patent issued
the panel divines this premise from a few passages in which eaton generally describes the advantages of the claimed adhesive
for example the panel_opinion relies on eatons statements to the board on december 27 1982 also importantly the adhesive must have temperature-flow_characteristics such that even if the surface of the adhesive is vertical the adhesive will not flow or sag at ordinarily encountered ambient storage *1575 temperatures less than 120¢Xf
that is to say the plastic_flow_temperature of the adhesive must be above 120¢Xf
according to the panel this quote demonstrates that` plastic_flow_temperature' had a vertical component that mr._nelson did not measure
to the contrary eaton did not shirk its duty to define the claim_terms
in the very same 1982 brief when actually distinguishing the prior_art cited by the examiner eaton specifically cited to the nelson_tests as the definition of` plastic_flow_temperature'

the record is replete with other instances in which eaton mentioned the word` vertical' in contexts fully consistent with using the nelson_tests as the measure of plastic_flow_temperature
for example in its amendment filed july_24,_1981 eaton argued a trap made [ in the manner described in the application ] has been evaluated by kenneth_a._nelson and found to have acceptable plastic_flow_characteristics
the trap can therefore be shipped or stored in vertical or inverted horizontal positions without fear of plastic_flow and thus contamination of adjacent_surfaces or spilling
eaton simply did not argue for its patent on the basis of some undefined vertical_flow capabilities
eaton had no need to test vertical_flow above 77¢Xf because its traps would be displayed vertically only at room_temperature

more importantly the pto understood this simple principle
the pto did not understand eaton to rely on a stringent vertical_test for flow_characteristics
both the examiner and the board expressly disclaimed any reliance on vertical or horizontal testing to determine patentability of the claimed invention
for example the examiner stated on may_27,_1986 [ w ] hether the body tests were done in vertical inverted horizontal or flat horizontal position has no relevance
the claims do not specify what position the adhesive is in regarding vertical_flow
the board expressed a similar view in its january 16 1987 decision on the second_reexamination the claims on appeal do not include any limitations restricting the orientation of the commercial_trap_product defined therein to any particular horizontal vertical or inverted disposition nor are there any limitations requiring flow of the adhesive from the container to be prevented for any particular length of time
these passages make absolutely clear that the pto did not decide to issue the584_patent based on any of eatons statements about vertical_flow or any of mr._questels tests
instead it is this court that first imports into the claims a supposed limitation from the prosecution_history-a limitation on which neither the applicant nor the pto relied during acquisition of the patent

in fact the pto never objected to the phrase` plastic_flow_temperature' as indefinite for lack of a vertical_flow test
if vertical_flow was the pivotal claim parameter perceived by this court then the pto should have noted its absence
instead the lengthy prosecution culminated in the issuance of the584_patent without so much as a mention of a mythical` missing' vertical_test

finally eaton did not as the panel suggests switch its focus from the nelson_tests to the questel_tests during the final_chapter of the prosecution
rather at the conclusion of the second_reexamination as at the beginning eaton relied on its consistent definition of plastic_flow_temperature the terminology` plastic_flow_temperature' in appellants claims on appeal has that meaning which is made clear elsewhere in the patent or in the file wrapper.. appellants defined their terminology` plastic_flow_temperature' throughout the prosecution of their application which matured as the subject patent as being a characteristic of the adhesive which would prevent the adhesive from sagging or flowing from its support at temperatures at which their product is shipped stored or used
this passage shows that eaton did not attempt to switch arguments on the pto in the closing chapter of the prosecution

perhaps aware of the danger of stringing together isolated passages out of context *1576 this court tries to correlate these passages by reference to private communications between eatons lawyers and scientists
specifically the panel relies on eatons attorneys instructions to mr._nelson about vertical_flow testing
far from supporting the missing test myth this tactic betrays this courts flawed method of seeking claim_meaning
these privileged exchanges are not part of the public_record
even if eatons attorneys believed patentability turned on vertical_flow at 120¢Xf such private correspondence not a part of the public_record can not possibly supply evidence of claim_meaning
see markman v. westview_instruments inc. 52_f.3d_967 979 34_uspq2d_1321 1329 fed.cir.1995 patent claims are construed in light of the public_record affd 517_u.s._370 116_s.ct._1384 134_l.ed.2d_577_(1996)
thus this court relies not only on out-of-context extracts but on extracts without any relevance to claim_interpretation
indeed few of the isolated passages on which this court relies had anything to do with the meaning of the plastic_flow characteristic
neither eaton nor the board relied on the passages to which this court attaches dispositive significance

for all these reasons i must conclude that this court has created a requirement for a stringent_vertical_flow_test that the claims read in light of the prosecution_history do not require
had eaton truly acquired its patent by requiring such a test the record would surely contain far more emphatic evidence than the few isolated passages cited in the panel_opinion
see york prods. inc. v. central tractor farm & family center 99_f.3d_1568 1575 40_uspq2d_1619 1624 fed.cir.1996` unless altering claim language to escape an examiner rejection a patent applicant only limits claims during prosecution by clearly disavowing claim coverage
``

b
without doubt the precedent of this court indicates that a patentees remarks during patent_prosecution can illuminate the meaning of the claims
see markman 52 f.3d at 980 ; vitronics 90 f.3d at 1582-83
however our precedent makes equally clear that this court construes an administrative_record in its full_context not on the basis of snippets lifted out of context
see unique concepts inc. v. brown 939_f.2d_1558 1565 19_uspq2d_1500 1506 fed.cir.1991` we construe claims in the light of the language of the claim itself the specification on which it is based and the whole prosecution_history'
( rich j. dissenting ; see also mark i mktg corp. v. r.r
donnelley & sons co. 66_f.3d_285 292 36_uspq2d_1095 1100 fed.cir.1995 cert
denied 516_u.s._1115 116_s.ct._917 133_l.ed.2d_847_(1996)
moreover the reviewing court must examine the full_context of prosecution_history to discern not only what the applicant said but why he said it
cf
hebert v. lisle corp. 99_f.3d_1109 1118 40_uspq2d_1611 1617 fed.cir.1996` it is of course necessary to consider not only the amendments to the claims but the reason why they were made..'

these basic legal principles disclose the infirmity of the courts reliance on two paragraphs from a single declaration at the end of the second_reexamination
a fair reading of the declaration indicates that mr._questel distinguished the prior_art formula no._31 adhesive on two grounds 1 it exhibited unacceptable_levels of cold flow i.e. 72¢Xf in a vertical_orientation ; and 2 it exhibited unacceptable_levels of hot flow when tested at 100¢Xf in a vertical_orientation
thus although mr._questel conducted twenty-four hour_vertical_tests at 120¢Xf neither he nor eaton ever relied on such tests to distinguish any prior_art
nor did mr._questel in any way suggest that he considered a twenty-four hour_vertical_test at 120¢Xf to be the measure of` plastic_flow_temperature'
this record simply does not support the courts conclusion that eatons claims are measured by the 120¢Xf vertical_flow test
see ethicon endo-surgery inc. v. united states surgical corp. 93_f.3d_1572 1581 40_uspq2d_1019 1025-26 fed.cir.1996 looking to` the prosecution_history as a whole' to determine how one skilled in the art would understand a claim_term clevenger j
)

sadly this courts fixation on the 120¢Xf vertical_flow test foreclosed the one claim_construction that was used repeatedly by all parties throughout the public_record
the district_court properly used that claim_interpretation
*1577 this court errs in departing from the full_context of the administrative_record and importing a false limitation from the prosecution_history

iii
finally even if i agreed with the panels claim_construction i could not join a reversal of the district_courts finding of infringement
this court decides this issue against eaton on the basis of a failure of proof-that is eatons failure to prove infringement under a claim_meaning no one had ever imagined before this courts pronouncement
the panel reasons that eaton should have known this courts interpretation of the claims and therefore had the burden of presenting adequate proof of infringement
contrary to this assumption no patentee in eatons position could have predicted this courts peculiar claim_construction
even atlantic a company with a strong incentive to adopt any argument to avoid infringement did not proffer this courts late-coming interpretation

in light of the time and resources invested in this patent and this infringement battle this court might at least have afforded eaton an opportunity to present evidence of infringement under this panels novel claim_construction
accordingly even if i could accept the courts claim_meaning i would remand the case for further_proceedings

iv
this decision stands as a monument at the troubled intersection between legal and factual analyses in this courts post-markman jurisprudence
that claims must be construed by the court does not divorce the interpretive process from a host of inherently factual subsidiary matters such as how one skilled in the art would understand claim_terms and prosecution_history statements
markman v. westview_instruments inc. 517_u.s._370 -- -- - -- -- 116_s.ct._1384 1395-96 134_l.ed.2d_577_(1996)` we accordingly think there is sufficient reason to treat construction of terms of art like many other responsibilities that we cede to a judge in the normal course of trial notwithstanding its evidentiary underpinnings`
this courts role in reviewing claim_meanings discerned by the district_courts calls for modesty and restraint-born not of timidity but of recognition of the limits inherent in appellate review
when an appellate court arrives at a novel claim_interpretation after nearly twenty years of prosecution and litigation it is inadequately equipped to test its new and unprecedented reading against the views of those skilled in the art
i believe the court today has overstepped the boundaries of effective appellate review

perhaps this court was influenced by the district_courts finding that but for the commercial_success of eatons trap_products the584_patent would be obvious
unfortunately this court does not address the issue of obviousness directly see e.g. newell cos. inc. v. kenney manufacturing co. 864_f.2d_757 768-69 9_uspq2d_1417 1426-27 fed.cir.1988 concluding that the patent-in-suit was obvious despite strong evidence of commercial_success but instead distorts claim_interpretation techniques to defeat infringement
although sensitive to questions about the validity of the584_patent i believe that the court should not give voice to those questions by means of a disingenuous reading of the prosecution_history
accordingly i must respectfully dissent
