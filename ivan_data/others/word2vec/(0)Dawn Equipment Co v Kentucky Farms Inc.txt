plager circuit_judge
in this patent infringement case the jury determined that the accused device although not literally infringing infringed under the doctrine of equivalents
the trial_judge gave judgment accordingly and denied defendants motion for judgment as a matter of law` jmol'
because on these facts no reasonable_jury could have found infringement we reverse the denial of defendants motion for jmol and order judgment for the defendant

background
plaintiff dawn_equipment company` dawn_equipment' sued defendant kentucky_farms incorporated` kentucky_farms' for infringement of u.s. patent no._5129,282`282_patent` entitled` mechanism for selectively repositioning a farm implement'
shortly before holding a jury_trial the trial_judge held a markman v. westview_instruments inc. 52_f.3d_967 975-76 34_uspq2d_1321 1325-26 fed.cir.1995 hearing to construe the only asserted patent claim
the trial_judge instructed the jury on his claim_construction and thereafter submitted the issues of literal_infringement and infringement under the doctrine of equivalents to the jury
the issues were submitted by way of two special interrogatories that asked the jury to answer with a simple yes or no whether there was literal_infringement and whether there was infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
the jury returned its verdict answering` no' to literal_infringement and` yes' to infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
kentucky_farms filed a motion for jmol on the doctrine of equivalents infringement verdict
the trial_judge denied the motion and this appeal followed

the282_patent discloses a device for adjusting the height of a farm_implement such as a row cleaning device
a row cleaning device which frequently consists of a pair of wheels having sharp teeth is often attached to a planter to clear residue from the planters path
in pointing out problems in the prior_art the282_patent describes prior_art` multi-hole pinned height_adjustment' mechanisms
'282_patent col._1,_l._55 to col._2,_l._29
the patent explains that raising or lowering such prior_art mechanisms can be very time-consuming tedious and repetitive
adjusting the height of such_mechanisms requires the operator to manually elevate and shift the farm_implement to align holes and insert pins
the patent also explains that the loose_pins used in the prior_art mechanisms are easily lost
moreover when adjusting the height of such a prior_art mechanism the operator is required to place himself beneath the farm_implement which increases the risk of accidents and injuries

the282_patent explains that these problems are avoided by using an improved mechanism illustrated in figures 1_and_2 of the patent reproduced below

*1011. ?
-- -- - figure 1 shows the height adjusting mechanism in the lowered position ; figure 2 shows the same device in the raised position
the device includes a control/locking_means 46 for alternating the implement between the raised and lowered positions
the control/locking_means includes a handle 48 cylindrical rods 50_and_56 a cylindrical_shaft 52 and a transverse_pin 54 carried on the cylindrical_shaft 52
a spring 68 biases the mechanism in the raised position as shown in figure 2
in the lowered position the pin 54 is engaged in the slot 72 against the bias of the spring 68
to move the implement from the lowered position to the raised position the operator presses down on and turns the handle 48 to rotate the pin 54 out of the slot 72
the spring 68 then overcomes the weight of the farm_implement and pushes the implement into the raised position
the patent explains that this operation can be performed safely and quickly from above the farm_implement

claim 9 of the patent the only claim at issue provides emphasis added *1012 a mechanism for adjusting the height of a farm_implement/tool of the type to be carried by a drawing_vehicle said adjusting mechanism comprising a connecting_means for supporting a farm_implement/tool in an operative position ; means for guiding sliding movement of the connecting_means selectively between first and second_positions corresponding to raised and lowered positions for a farm_implement/tool carried by the connecting_means ; means for mounting the guiding means to one of a drawing_vehicle and a support to be carried by a drawing_vehicle ; means for locking the connecting_means in one of the first and second_positions and for selectively releasing the connecting_means to allow the connecting_means to be slid into the other of the first and second_positions_therefor ; means for limiting sliding movement of the connecting_means with the connecting_means released ; and
means for normally spring biasing the connecting_means to one of the first and second_positions_therefor

the accused kentucky_farms_device illustrated below includes a connecting bar 10 which telescopes within a rectangular sleeve 12

*1013. ?
-- -- - a row cleaning device or other farm_implement is attached to the connecting bar 10 at a pair of axes 14
the sleeve 12 is bolted onto a mounting bracket 16 which is attached to a planter
the connecting bar 10 is inserted in sleeve 12 and a bolt 20 is inserted in the uppermost opening in the connecting bar 10 to prevent the connecting bar from slipping down through the sleeve 12
a spring 22 attached at its upper end to the sleeve 12 and at its lower end to the connecting bar 10 supports a portion of the weight of the connecting bar and attached row cleaning device

the kentucky_farms_device has a multiple-hole pinned height_adjustment_mechanism
in that mechanism a removable angled pin 30 is used to secure the connecting *big_token__1014_bar_10__big_token within the sleeve 12 at a desired height thereby setting the height of the attached row cleaning device
in particular the connecting bar 10 is adjusted to the desired height and then the pin 30 is inserted through one set of holes 26 in the sleeve and one set of holes 28 in the connecting bar
a retaining clip not shown in the above diagram is then placed through a hole in the straight end of the pin 30 to prevent the pin 30 from sliding out
the retaining clip must first be removed before the height can be readjusted

on appeal kentucky_farms contends that the trial_judge erred by construing claim 9 too broadly
however kentucky_farms contends that even under the trial_judges claim_construction the jury_verdict of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents can not stand and that the trial_judge therefore erred in not granting kentucky_farms motion for jmol
in the alternative kentucky_farms asserts that in the event we do not order judgment in its favor it is entitled to a new trial in view of the alleged erroneous claim_construction
dawn_equipment in response argues that the trial_judge properly construed claim 9 and that the jurys verdict is supported by substantial_evidence and therefore should not be disturbed

discussion
1
in reviewing the trial_judges denial of kentucky_farms motion for jmol we keep in mind our standard of review which is the same standard that was applicable at the trial court level
see texas_instruments inc. v. cypress semiconductor corp. 90_f.3d_1558 1563 39_uspq2d_1492 1496 fed.cir.1996 noting that a district_courts jmol ruling is reviewed by reapplying jmol standard cert
denied 520_u.s._1228 117_s.ct._1818 137_l.ed.2d_1027_(1997)
legal standards given to the jury are reviewed without deference to the trial court whereas the jurys resolution of factual disputes are reviewed to determine whether there is substantial_evidence to support them
see markman v. westview_instruments inc. 52_f.3d_967 975-76 34_uspq2d_1321 1325-26 fed.cir.1995 in banc affd 517_u.s._370 116_s.ct._1384 134_l.ed.2d_577 38_uspq2d_1461_(1996)
in reviewing factual issues for substantial_evidence the inquiry is whether a reasonable_jury given the record before it viewed as a whole could have arrived at the conclusion it did
see texas_instruments 90 f.3d at 1563 39 uspq2d at 1496

2
it is standard doctrine that determining infringement is a two-step process
see id. 39 uspq2d at 1497
first the court must construe the asserted claims as a matter of law to ascertain their meaning and scope
see id
second the claims as construed are compared to the allegedly infringing device
see id
to infringe a claim each claim_limitation must be present in the accused product literally or equivalently
see sofamor_danek_group inc. v. depuy-motech inc. 74_f.3d_1216 1220 37_uspq2d_1529 1531 fed.cir.1996
thus the construction of each claim_limitation is crucial to the infringement determination

we begin with the first step claim_construction
the pertinent claim_limitation here is the means for locking and releasing recited specifically as means for locking the connecting_means in one of the first and second_positions and for selectively releasing the connecting_means to allow the connecting_means to be slid into the other of the first and second_positions_therefor ;282_patent col._6,_ll._56-60
as the parties agree this limitation is a so-called means-plus-function_claim_limitation drafted pursuant to 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
6 1994big_token__1_section_112__big_token ?
6 specifies that such_limitations` shall be construed to cover the corresponding_structure.. described in the specification and equivalents thereof'
here the most closely corresponding_structure described in the specification that is in the written description *1015 is the control/locking_means 46 described as

a control/locking_means 46 for selectively raising and lowering the implement/tool 8 includes an external handle 48 a first cylindrical rod 50 a cylindrical base portion 52 including a transverse_pin 54 and a second cylindrical rod 56 coaxial with the rod 50
id.at col._4,_ll._45-49
the patent goes on to explain that` [ t ] he handle 48 of the locking_means 46 is used to selectively rotate the.. pin 54 into and out of [ the ] slot 72'
id.at col._5,_ll._2-5
the patent illustrates this structure in figures 1_and_2 included above
as a matter of claim_construction the trial_judge identified the rotatable_shaft 52 the pin 54 and the slot 72 as the structure corresponding to the means for locking and releasing and accordingly instructed the jury the second [ claim clause at issue ] is [ the ] means for locking the connecting [ means ] in one of the first and second_positions and for selectively releasing the connecting_means to allow the connecting_means to be slid into the other of the first and second_positions_therefor
the court has determined that the structure described in the patent for performing this function is the rotatable_shaft 52 the pin 54 and the slot 72 with which the pin is moved in and out of engagement the slot being in the bracket 24 to lock the movable connecting stem assembly 30 to the fixed guide bracket 24 in the raised or lowered position
this structure is shown in figures 1 2 and 3 of the282_patent
according to kentucky_farms the trial_judge was correct in identifying the rotatable_shaft 52 the pin 54 and the slot 72 as part of the described structure corresponding to the locking and releasing_means but erred by not also including the handle 48
dawn_equipment on the other_hand asserts that the trial_judge got the claim_construction right
thus the only claim_construction issue raised by the parties is whether the corresponding_structure includes the handle 48

we need not resolve this issue of claim_construction because viewing the corresponding_structure as including the rotatable_shaft 52 pin 54 and slot 72-to which neither party objects and with which we detect no error-is sufficient to resolve the ultimate infringement issue
as we shall now explain even construing the corresponding_structure as including only the rotatable_shaft pin and slot kentucky_farms device does not infringe because under this claim_construction kentucky_farms device though it performs the specified locking and releasing function does not include equivalent_structure
further including the handle 48 as part of the corresponding_structure which appears reasonable would only provide another reason for noninfringement

3
having addressed claim_construction we proceed to the second step application of the construed claim to the accused device
given the jurys verdict and the form of appeal we are presented only with the issue of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents.2 as recently made clear by the supreme_court in its warner-jenkinson opinion infringement under the doctrine of equivalents must be established on a limitation-by-limitation_basis
see warner-jenkinson_co. v. hilton_davis_chem co. 520_u.s._17 -- -- 117_s.ct._1040 1049 137_l.ed.2d_146 41_uspq2d_1865 1871 1997
thus to establish infringement under the doctrine of equivalents the accused device must be shown to include an equivalent for each literally absent claim_limitation

to determine equivalence under the doctrine of equivalents this court applies the` insubstantial_differences' test recognizing the admitted short-comings of that test
see for example the supreme_courts critical assessment of that test in warner-jenkinson` the insubstantial_differences test offers little additional guidance as to what *1016 might render any given differenceinsubstantial
`` id.at -- -- 117 s.ct.at 1054 41 uspq2d at 1875
in appropriate cases the function-way-result_test discussed at length in hilton_davis_chemical_co. v. warner-jenkinson_co. 62_f.3d_1512 1518 35_uspq2d_1641 1645 fed.cir.1995 in banc revd on other_grounds 520_u.s._17 117_s.ct._1040 137_l.ed.2d_146 41_uspq2d_1865 1997 offers additional guidance on the question of equivalence

under the function-way-result_test one considers whether the element of the accused device at issue performs substantially the same_function in substantially the same_way to achieve substantially the same_result as the limitation at issue in the claim
see id
in warner-jenkinson the supreme_court observed that this test` may be suitable for analyzing mechanical inventions'
520 u.s. at -- -- 117 s.ct.at 1054 137_l.ed.2d_146 41 uspq2d at 1875
we have such an invention here and the jury was instructed on this test as well as the insubstantial_differences test.3 accordingly we also consider the function-way-result_test and find it somewhat helpful

with the legal background set we now consider the issue presented by the parties does kentucky_farms device include an equivalent to the claimed locking and releasing_means such that kentucky_farms satisfies the means-plus-function_limitation under the doctrine of equivalents ?
dawn_equipment in essence asserts that the multiple-hole pinned height-adjustment_mechanism in kentucky_farms device is equivalent to the structure set forth in the patent
as already described the multiple-hole pinned height-adjustment_mechanism in kentucky_farms device includes a loose angled pin 30 and two sets of holes 26_and_28
thus based on the above claim_construction the issue of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents is in the vernacular of the function-way-result_test whether the loose_pin and holes_combination in kentucky_farms device performs substantially the same_function in substantially the same_way to achieve substantially the same_result as the rotatable_shaft pin and slot_mechanism shown in figures 1_and_2 of the282_patent
we reach the obvious conclusion that applying this test no reasonable_jury could have found infringement under the doctrine of equivalents

while the functions of the two mechanisms are the same i.e. locking and releasing a connecting member the way and result are not substantially the same
the mechanisms are structurally quite different and operate quite differently
in the patented device the pin 54 is permanently fixed to the rotatable_shaft 52 and is locked into and released from engagement with the slot 72 by rotating the shaft 52
in sharp_contrast in kentucky_farms device the pin 30 is not attached to anything and is inserted in and removed from the holes 26_and_28 by hand

there is damning evidence within the text of the282_patent itself that the two mechanisms do not operate in substantially the same_way
specifically the patent strongly suggests if not teaches that they are not equivalent
the282_patent in its background of the invention section describes the problems with prior_art` multi-hole pinned height_adjustment' mechanisms
the patent teaches that such_mechanisms are time-consuming to adjust and are prone to misadjustment by inserting the pin in the wrong holes and furthermore the loose_pins in such_mechanisms are easily lost
'282_patent col._2,_ll._12-29
kentucky_farms multiple-hole pinned height-adjustment_mechanism is such a mechanism and shares these same problems
in contrast the282_patent teaches that the mechanism provided by the patented invention is directed at solving these problems
id.at col._2,_ll._31-34
these statements in the patent alone strongly suggest if not mandate judgment in kentucky_farms favor
see sofamor 74 f.3d at 1220 37 uspq2d at 1531-32 resorting to the description in the patent specification of disadvantages *1017 of the prior_art in evaluating equivalence

furthermore consistent with these statements in the patent dawn_equipment was unable to provide sufficient evidence that the kentucky_farms loose_pin and holes mechanism operates in substantially the same_way as the rotatable_shaft pin and slot_mechanism disclosed in the patent
indeed while dawn_equipment presented substantial expert testimony on infringement the experts in testifying with regard to these two mechanisms merely compared the pins in the two mechanisms
the experts testified that the mechanisms were similar because they both had pins and opined that the sliding versus rotating motions of the pins in the two mechanisms were simply common alternatives
most notably the experts made no reference to the rotatable_shaft 52 in the mechanism disclosed in the282_patent
in essence the experts opined that the two mechanisms were equivalent because they both used pins and because sliding versus rotating the respective pins was in their opinions a common alternative

mere comparison of the pins is insufficient to establish that the devices operate in substantially the same_way
as the jury was instructed the relevant structure disclosed in the282_patent included at least the rotatable_shaft pin and slot-not merely a pin
the testimony by dawn_equipments experts fails to establish that kentucky farms loose_pin and holes_combination is equivalent to the rotatable_shaft pin and slot_mechanism particularly in view of the contrary statements in the282_patent
see texas_instruments 90 f.3d at 1567-68 39 uspq2d at 1500 holding that conclusory expert testimony as to the overall similarity of a claim_limitation and the alleged corresponding element in the accused product was insufficient to establish equivalence under the doctrine of equivalents

with regard to the result kentucky_farms loose_pin and holes_combination does not accomplish substantially the same_results provided by the rotatable_shaft pin and slot_mechanism disclosed in the282_patent
in particular the patent touts that the invention reduces adjustment_time prevents misadjustment and eliminates the problem of easily lost pins
the disclosed shaft pin and slot_mechanism plays a major role in achieving these results
because the mechanism is easy and quick to operate adjustment_time is reduced and because the mechanism only allows for two positions lowered and raised misadjustment is prevented
see282_patent col._2,_ll._58-61 col._3,_ll._5-9 32-34
furthermore because the pin is fixed to the rotatable_shaft the pin can not be lost
in sharp_contrast kentucky_farms loose_pin and holes_combination accomplishes none of these touted results
as the patent describes a loose_pin and holes mechanism is time consuming to adjust is prone to misadjustment because of the multiple holes and the loose_pin is easily lost
id.at col._2,_ll._12-28

accordingly viewing the record as a whole the jurys verdict of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents is not supported by substantial_evidence
no reasonable_jury could have found infringement under the doctrine of equivalents

in warner-jenkinson the supreme_court urged district_courts in appropriate circumstances to give serious consideration to directing judgment e.g. in response to a motion for summary_judgment or jmol on the issue of equivalence under the doctrine of equivalents and in fact stated that district_courts` are obliged' to do so` [ w ] here the evidence is such that no reasonable_jury could determine two elements to be equivalent'
520 u.s. at -- -- n. 8 117 s.ct.at 1053_n._8 137_l.ed.2d_146 41 uspq2d at 1875_n._8
the court recognized that there may be` a reluctance to do so by some courts' and encouraged this court to remedy the problem
id
in this vein we note that while infringement under the doctrine of equivalents is generally considered a question of fact that does not in and of itself preclude directing judgment in favor of the accused infringer
there is a triable issue of fact only if the evidence is such that a reasonable_jury could resolve the question in favor of the patentee
see id
in this case no reasonable_jury could have found equivalence
it accordingly was error not to order judgment in favor of kentucky_farms

*1018 conclusion
the judgment denying the defendants motion for jmol is reversed ; judgment for the defendant is ordered

reversed

plager circuit_judge additional_views
i write additionally because i find the law in this area confused and confusing
the limitations in the claim at issue are drawn in means-plus-function_form pursuant to 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
6 1994
section 112 paragraph 6 provides that such_limitations1` may be expressed as a means.. for performing a specified_function without the recital of structure material or acts in support thereof..' when so expressed` such claim [ limitations ] shall be construed to cover the corresponding_structure material or acts described in the specification and equivalents thereof'
35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
6 emphasis added

it is established law that when an accused product satisfies such claim_limitations by way of structure equivalent to that described in the specification and otherwise satisfies the requirements for infringement the infringement is deemed literal_infringement
see e.g. p.m. palumbo v. don-joy co. 762_f.2d_969 975_n._4 226_uspq_5 8_n._4_(fed.cir.1985) noting that use of an` equivalent' under ¡± 112 ?
6 leads to literal_infringement rather than infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
thus with regard to claim_limitations drawn pursuant to ¡± 112 ?
6 the notion of literal_infringement as distinct from infringement under the doctrine of equivalents includes equivalents

what place then is there for the doctrine of equivalents with regard to such claim_limitations ?
opinions of this court have attempted to draw a distinction between what is meant by an equivalent under ¡± 112 ?
6 and what is meant by an equivalent under the doctrine of equivalents
the implicit assumption is that as a matter of law a patentee with a ¡± 112 ?
6 claim has a choice of alleging infringement under either or both and the trier of fact is free to find that the accused product does not infringe under the one kind of equivalent but does under the other

one problem with this approach is that it assumes that there are clearly defined operational differences between these two notions of equivalents and that triers of fact usually whether judge or jury persons unfamiliar in the first instance with the technology at issue much less the legal conceptualizations can readily differentiate between them
two cases from this court in recent years have spoken to the distinctions between the two types of equivalents and have attempted to draw out the character of these differences valmont_industries. inc. v. reinke_manufacturing_co. 983_f.2d_1039 1041-44 25_uspq2d_1451 1453-55 fed.cir.1993 ; and alpex_computer_corp. v. nintendo_co. 102_f.3d_1214 1222 40_uspq2d_1667 1673-74 fed.cir.1996 cert
denied 521_u.s._1104 117_s.ct._2480 138_l.ed.2d_989_(1997)

the cases cast the differences in terms of separate origins and purposes and that the different equivalents have different` application'
valmont 983 f.2d at 1043-44 25 uspq2d at 1454 ; alpex 102 f.3d at 1222 40 uspq2d at 1673
on the other_hand they are in agreement that the term` equivalent' in both statute and doctrine to employ the phrase used in valmont` invokes the familiar concept of an insubstantial change which adds nothing of significance'
valmont 983 f.2d at 1043 25 uspq2d at 1455 ; see also alpex 102 f.3d at 1222 40 uspq2d at 1673-74
this suggests at the least that the tests for equivalence under the statute and the doctrine are quite similar if not the same

the valmont and alpex courts attempt to distinguish the tests on several grounds
the alpex court opines that under the statute the accused product is compared to the structure disclosed in the specification corresponding to the means-plus-function_claim_limitation whereas under the doctrine the accused product is compared to the claim_limitation
alpex 102 f.3d at 1222 40 uspq2d at 1673-74
the valmont court *1019 went further and opined that a statutory equivalent under ¡± 112 ?
6` does not involve the equitable tripartite_test of the doctrine of equivalents' i.e. the so-called function-way-result_test
valmont 983 f.2d at 1043 25 uspq2d at 1455
this was thought to follow from the fact that` the sole question' under ¡± 112 ?
6 involves comparison of the structure in the accused product to the structure in the specification
id

however these perceived distinctions appear to be either nonexistent or without significance or are at least beyond what we can reasonably expect the triers of fact to sensibly discern
with regard to the distinction set forth in alpex the comparison for purposes of the doctrine of equivalents of an accused product to a claim_limitation drafted pursuant to ¡± 112 ?
6 necessarily involves a comparison to the corresponding_structure described in the specification
this is because ¡± 112 ?
6 mandates that such_limitations are to be construed to cover the described corresponding_structures and their equivalents
indeed if the comparison under the doctrine is merely to the language in the claim the comparison can not be meaningfully made because by definition the ¡± 112 ?
6 claim_limitation recites no structure material or acts

considered another way without reference to the corresponding_structures described in the specification any and all structures which perform the specified_function would satisfy the claim_limitation under the doctrine
that is clearly not the law of this court
for example in valmont in applying the function-way-result_test for purposes of the doctrine of equivalents the court determined that there was not infringement under the doctrine of a claim drafted pursuant to ¡± 112 ?
6 because the accused device was very different from that described in the patent.2 valmont 983 f.2d at 1044 25 uspq2d at 1456
thus whether considering infringement under ¡± 112 ?
6 or the doctrine of equivalents a comparison must be made to the described structure corresponding to the ¡± 112 ?
6 claim_limitation

with regard to the suggestion in valmont that the function-way-result_test is not applicable to determining equivalence under ¡± 112 ?
6 it is not readily apparent why use of the` way' and` result' parts of the tripartite_test to the extent that test is useful at all would not also be helpful in the ¡± 112 ?
6 context
( with regard to the` function' part of the test the statute already carries with it a requirement that the specified_function be the same
indeed in a case decided prior to valmont this court opined that the same tripartite_test does apply to determining equivalence under the statute whether the issue is equivalency of a means that is described in the specification to perform a function in a` means' clause of a combination claim i.e. literal_infringement or equivalency to the claimed invention as a whole i.e. infringement by the doctrine of equivalents the test is the same three-part test of history does the asserted equivalent perform substantially the same_function in substantially the same_way to accomplish substantially the same_result
( in the case of` means' clauses of course the function is that stated in the claim
texas_instruments inc. v. united states int l trade comm n 805_f.2d_1558 1571 231_uspq_833 841 fed.cir.19863 furthermore given the statements in valmont and alpex that under both statute and doctrine the issue is insubstantial_changes and given this courts more-recent statement that the question of insubstantial_differences under the doctrine may be satisfied by way of the tripartite_test see *1020 hilton_davis_chem co. v. warner-jenkinson_co. 62_f.3d_1512 1517-18 35_uspq2d_1641 1645 fed.cir.1995 in banc revd on other_grounds 520_u.s._17 117_s.ct._1040 137_l.ed.2d_146 41_uspq2d_1865 1997 it is difficult to understand why the tripartite_test would not also be available to resolve the question of insubstantial_changes under the statute

there are no doubt other application details under the statute and doctrine that have developed in the case law over the years
one could attempt to distinguish the tests for equivalence based on such details
however such an analysis begs the ultimate questions what if any difference is there between the scope of protection provided ?
can triers of fact sensibly discern any such difference ?
given the substantial risk of confusion should there be two notions of equivalents ?

to date the descriptions offered of the differences between equivalents under the statute and under the doctrine though they may accurately capture the two ways in which the notion of equivalents has developed and is thought to function provide little of real guidance to a trier of fact called upon to distinguish the scope of one kind of equivalent from the other
more to the point the existence of two` different' notions of equivalents can not help but add a further source of confusion especially when submitted to a jury for decision based on the kinds of explanatory material available in the cases

in the case before us the jury was charged to answer whether the claim at issue was literally infringed
the jurys response was` no'
because the claim consisted solely of means-plus-function_limitations literal_infringement required a finding that the accused device performed the specified_functions recited in the means-plus-function_limitations with structure the same as or equivalent to the corresponding_structure described in the specification
see e.g. valmont 983 f.2d at 1042 25 uspq2d at 1454 setting forth the test for literal satisfaction of a means-plus-function_limitation
there appears to be no genuine issue with regard to the specified_functions ; the accused device appears to perform the functions recited in the means-plus-function_claim_limitations and i assume such to be the case
thus as a matter of statutory construction and controlling precedent the jury_verdict on literal_infringement means that in the jurys view the accused device had neither the corresponding_structure described in the specification nor equivalents thereof

but the jury was further charged to answer whether the claim at issue was infringed under the doctrine of equivalents
to this question the jury answered` yes'
what could that mean ?
the jury by its vote on literal_infringement had already ruled out infringement based on the corresponding_structure and as a matter of established law it had also ruled out infringement based on equivalent_structure because that also would have been properly classified as` literal' infringement

given that a finding of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents could only mean that there is something perceivably different between an equivalent under the doctrine and the equivalent or lack thereof under the statutory test
what this could possibly be escapes me
beyond that is it possible that the jury thought there was something called an equivalent of an equivalent and that is what the jury found to exist ?

these are not simply matters of semantics
they go to the very act of deliberative decision making decision making based on a meaningful rule of law
however many variations there are in the words we use to describe the criteria by which to determine when something in fact is the` equivalent' of something else see e.g. hilton_davis 62 f.3d at 1517-18 35 uspq2d at 1645 defining equivalence as` insubstantial_differences' and mentioning that that test may be satisfied where the function way and result are substantially the same the basic notion of equivalence does not vary
an equivalent is something that is` equal in force or amount'` like in signification or import'` synonymous' etc
websters third new international dictionary 769 1986
if b is not the equivalent of a using one understanding of equivalent can it be said that b is the equivalent of a using a second undefined or similarly understood meaning of equivalent ?
worse yet can it be said that b is the equivalent of the unknown equivalent of a ?
stating a rule of law to permit that manner *1021 of thinking is simply an invitation to confused thinking
it certainly invites results that defy understanding

our cases seem to assume without examining the question beyond that discussed above that these two different kinds of equivalents exist and that they are available to a trier of fact when dealing with infringement of a claim drafted pursuant to ¡± 112 ?

in the case before us neither party seemed to find the idea of two different notions of equivalents problematical before or during trial although on appeal kentucky_farms argues that the jurys verdicts on literal_infringement and infringement under the doctrine of equivalents are inconsistent

though the question of two kinds of equivalents has never been addressed head-on by this court commentators have addressed it and found this courts practice anomalous
see laurence h. pretty & janene bassett reconciling section 112 paragraph 6 with the doctrine of equivalents in the wake of warner-jenkinson_co. v. hilton_davis_chemical 489 pli/pat 359 378 391-92 1997 concluding that the equivalence analyses under ¡± 112 ?

& tech
205 227 1994 concluding that ¡± 112 ?
6 and the doctrine of equivalents share the same concept of equivalence and therefore recommending that the same test of equivalence be used for both

it should be remembered that ¡± 112 ?
6 was a legislative solution to a problem in claiming-broadly stated claims using means-plus-function_language were too vague to be judicially enforced
see valmont 983 f.2d at 1042 25 uspq2d at 1453-54 noting that ¡± 112 ?
6 was enacted in response to the supreme_court prohibiting certain use of means-plus-function_language in halliburton oil well cementing co. v. walker 329_u.s._1 67_s.ct._6 91_l.ed._3_(1946)
the purpose of ¡± 112 ?
6 was to provide clear parameters within which means-plus-function claims could be drawn and sensibly construed
speaking in terms of dual and competing notions of equivalents seems to me to be wholly inconsistent with that legislative_purpose
furthermore the doctrine of equivalents is a judge-made solution to a concern about overly-literal infringers
congress having expressly provided against an overly-literal reading of ¡± 112 ?
6 claims by allowing for equivalents there would seem to be no justification for intrusion by the courts to duplicate or differ from the legislative solution.4

in that light and consistent with that purpose i believe that the practice of claiming under ¡± 112 ?
6 would be much improved if we adhered to the proposition that the *1022` equivalents' of` structure material or acts described in the specification' are those found to be within the scope of that term as it is used in ¡± 112 ?
6 and not elsewhere
accordingly the separate judicially-created doctrine of equivalents would have no application to those aspects of limitations drawn in means-plus-function_form
this result is fully consistent with the legislative_purpose of ¡± 112 ?
6 and with its plain language which expressly provides for equivalents with regard to those parts of a means-plus-function claim for which congress chose to permit equivalents.5

in the case before us whether one views the jurys verdict as finding equivalents solely under the statutory grant or under the judicially-defined doctrine of equivalents no reasonable_jury could have found that the accused device was equivalent
whether the error would have been avoided had the jury been limited solely to determining literal_infringement including of course one level of` equivalents' is unknown and for this case at least irrelevant
i do believe however that limiting a jury as well as ourselves to one notion of equivalents at a time can only help

newman circuit_judge additional_views
i write separately to respond to the` additional_views' filed by judge_plager
with all respect to my thoughtful colleague his proposal that established law should be changed even were such change available to the judges of this court simply moves the federal_circuit farther from the principles of stare decisis
this already difficult area of law will not benefit from added uncertainty

the distinction between the doctrine of equivalents and section 112 equivalents if confusing to jurors has long been understood by practitioners of patent_law
these different rules serve different purposes
other than further to restrict the doctrine of equivalents i know of no policy reason for eliminating access to the doctrine of equivalents with respect to the claimed function when claims are written in` means-plus-function' form
the style of claims is not the sine qua non of the patent right and the equitable purposes of the doctrine of equivalents do not rise and fall with whether the patentee used the claim form authorized in section 112_paragraph_6

precedent has often explained and implemented the distinct purposes of these two practices
e.g. pennwalt corp. v. durand-wayland inc. 833_f.2d_931 934 4_uspq2d_1737 1739 fed.cir.1987 en banc` section 112 paragraph 6 plays no role in determining whether an equivalent_function is performed by the accused device under the doctrine of equivalents
`` ; alpex_computer_corp. v. nintendo_co. 102_f.3d_1214 1222 40_uspq2d_1667 1673 fed.cir.1996` while equivalency under the doctrine of equivalents and equivalency under ¡± 112 ?
6 both relate to insubstantial_changes each has a separate origin purpose and application
`` ; valmont_industries inc. v. reinke_manufacturing_co. 983_f.2d_1039 1043 25_uspq2d_1451 1454 fed.cir.1993` the doctrine of equivalents has a different purpose and application than section 112'
although laypersons may have trouble understanding this distinction that can be said of many areas of law
indeed the jury problem that judge_plager identifies in this case could have been easily avoided by presenting more explicit special verdicts

the proposed elimination of recourse to the doctrine of equivalents for claim elements described in means-plus-function_form would markedly diminish the scope of the doctrine
this step has no support in precedent
whether or not further restriction on the doctrine of equivalents will be warranted as in the fullness of time more is learned of its role in the larger system of national innovation policy it is inappropriate for this court to undertake such a major step sua sponte
judge_plagers suggestion that the law is wrong will send a sure signal to litigants *1023 opening every district_court to the argument
this can not add stability to patent_law or certainty to those seeking to conduct their business in reliance on law

michel circuit_judge additional_views
i wonder if affording the patentee additional protection under the doctrine of equivalents conflicts with the very language and intent of 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 6 1994 which covers only those` equivalents' disclosed in the specification

as the supreme_court reemphasized in warner-jenkinson_co. v. hilton_davis_chemical_co. 520_u.s._17 -- -- 117_s.ct._1040 1051 137_l.ed.2d_146 1997 the notice_function of patents is critical.1 market participants as well as judges and jurors must be able to ascertain what subject matter is covered by the right to exclude
the notice_function is especially important for the patentees competitors who need to shape their behavior by relying on the patent file
the need for clear notice is all the greater in the case of means-plus-function_limitations because the claim language alone does not define the scope of protection

as we have construed section 112 6 a patentee who claims an element of a mechanical device using means-plus-function_language is entitled to protection of the corresponding_structure s described in the specification and all` equivalent_structures' or as some of our cases have termed them` structural equivalents' see e.g. alpex_computer_corp. v. nintendo_co. 102_f.3d_1214 1221 fed.cir.1996 ; ven-tel inc. v. hayes microcomputer prods. inc. 982_f.2d_1527 1543 fed.cir.1992
congress thus provided the patentee with two benefits from section 112 6 first it need not claim structure but can simply rely on the written description and drawings to obtain protection for all of its disclosed structures ; and second it gets protection of all equivalents of whatever structures it has disclosed in its specification
did congress intend that the price for those benefits was foregoing coverage of even broader equivalents under the doctrine ?

is it contrary to section 112 6 to expand the protection for inventions claimed partly in means-plus-function_format by also applying the doctrine of equivalents to limitations claimed in that format when protection for some but not all equivalents has already been incorporated into the statute itself and when doing so further diminishes the notice_function of the patent ?
or did congress intend the courts to apply the doctrine of equivalents to the means-plus-function_format just as we apply the doctrine to structural formats ?

until we are required to review a case in which these issues actually have been litigated,2 we can not answer the questions raised in the three additional_views here

although the opinions in pennwalt alpex and valmont discuss quite thoroughly the distinctions between structural equivalence and the doctrine of equivalents in the context of section 112 6 claims all three cases simply presumed that the doctrine applied to such claims and none of the cases turned on a challenge to the application of the doctrine
