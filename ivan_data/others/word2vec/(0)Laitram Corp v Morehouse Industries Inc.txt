synopsis
patentee brought action alleging infringement of patents for plastic modules used to form conveyor_belts
the united_states_district_court for the eastern_district of california william b. shubb chief judge granted summary_judgment for alleged infringer on grounds of noninfringement but granted summary_judgment for patentee on issue of validity
patentee appealed and alleged infringer cross-appealed
the court of appeals lourie circuit_judge held that 1 claims at issue required claimed modules to have flat_driving_surfaces so claims were not literally infringed by accused devices which had curved driving_surfaces ; 2` sprocket_recess' limitation in patent required two opposing transverse_elements and patent was thus not literally infringed by accused device which contained single_transverse_section ; and 3 patents were not infringed under doctrine of equivalents

affirmed

because neither the courts claim_construction nor its noninfringement determination was in error and because the court did not err in concluding that kvp could not meet its burden of proving invalidity by clear and convincing_evidence we affirm

background
u.s
patents b1 4,934,518 and b1 4,886,158 issued from continuations of the same parent application and pertain generally to a plastic` module' 10 connectable to other like modules to form a conveyor_belt
as described in the specifications of the two patents which share a common written description the center of each module contains several` sprocket_recesses' 50 which mate with` sprockets' i.e. teeth 52 of a` sprocket_wheel' 54 during operation of the conveyor_belt
the disclosed sprocket_recesses are trapezoidally-shaped and are designed to mate with trapezoidally-shaped sprockets
the angled edges of the sprocket_recesses are referred to in the written description as` transverse_sections' 32_and_34 and the areas of engagement between the sprockets and the transverse_sections are referred to as the` driving_surfaces'
these various elements are shown in figures 1 3 and 7 which respectively show a single module a cross-section of a single sprocket_recess and a conveyor_belt comprising several interconnected modules

laitram sued kvp alleging that two of its products the` all-in-one' module and the` fluid_flo' module infringe claims 1 5 7 49 and 100 of its518_patent and claim 10 of its158_patent1 pictures of the accused modules are shown below

?
-- -- - the parties do not dispute that the driving_surfaces of the accused modules are curved and that the` all-in-one' module contains a single_transverse_section forming a single driving surface

all of the disputed limitations of the asserted claims are similar to each other differing in ways immaterial to this appeal
the limitations of claim 1 of the518_patent are representative ; that claim reads as follows' at least two transverse_elements.. defining at least two sprocket_recesses.. capable of receiving cooperative sprocket_teeth' [ the` sprocket_recess' limitation ]
each transverse_element having a` driving surface within said sprocket_recesses and at least a portion of each of said driving_surfaces extending downwardly.. and in the direction of intended_travel' [ the` driving surface' limitation ]

kvp moved for summary_judgment of noninfringement and invalidity in the district_court
the district_court examined the claim_language the written description and the *1460 prosecution_history2 in arriving at an interpretation of these limitations ; the most pertinent aspects of the courts analysis are summarized here
in order to determine if the` driving surface' limitation reads on the curved driving_surfaces of the accused devices the court noted that the written description disclosed only flat i.e. planar surfaces
moreover the court observed that during prosecution the applicant attempted to distinguish his invention over the prior_art by arguing that the combination of the kewley763 and palmaer831_patent s did not render his invention obvious because

the cylindrically shaped wall of the drive_link of the chain of palmaer.. does not and could not provide the module of the instant_invention having an intermediate_section composed of at least one transverse_member and longitudinal_members intersecting the transverse_member that define at least one sprocket_recess where the [ sic ] at least one transverse_element has a driving surface within the sprocket_recess that extends downwardly toward the bottom_surface and in the direction of travel
( emphasis added3 accordingly the court concluded that the applicant` distinguished a cylindrically shaped driving surface from one thatextends downwardly toward the bottom_surface in the direction of travel` slip op.at a19 and that the` driving surface' limitation was accordingly limited to` angled planar' driving_surfaces id.at a21
the district_court construed the` sprocket_recess' limitation as requiring` opposing transverse_elements each of which contains a driving surface capable of mating with the corresponding side of a single sprocket_tooth'
id.at a26 emphasis added
the court again turned to the written description and noted that the only disclosed embodiment showed sprocket_recesses bound by two opposing transverse_elements
see e.g. figure 3 supra
the court also observed that the benefits of having opposing transverse_elements were noted in the written description as allowing bi-directional_movement` [ t ] he sprocket_recesses 50 are in line and can be driven in either direction
the associated sprocket_teeth are also symmetrical and in line such that the sprocket_wheel can be driven in either direction and installed either way on a driving shaft.`
'158_patent col._4,_ll._38-42

the court also found support for its interpretation of the` sprocket_recess' limitation in the prosecution_history
first the court observed that the applicant had described the` essence' of his invention as` the provision of sprocket_recesses.. having angularly disposed sides adapted to mate with corresponding sprocket_teeth without scrubbing
`` 4 emphasis added
second the court noted that the applicant had distinguished his invention over lapeyre527 which disclosed only a single_transverse_element by noting that` the lapeyre527_patent.. does not disclose or suggest the presently claimed invention and does not even teach the use of sprocket_recesses in conveyor modules'
third the court noted that the applicant represented that his invention required that a given sprocket_tooth during operation of the belt contacted both the front and back of the recess and therefore by necessary implication that the recess necessarily included *1461 opposing transverse_elements
specifically when arguing that his claims were not anticipated by kewley763 the applicant noted that` [ a ] ny attempt to drive a conveyor_belt built according to the kewley [ p ] atent by a sprocket_tooth simultaneously contacting both interior parallel surfaces would clearly be technically unfeasible and would render the belt substantially inoperative'
( emphasis added

finally the court considered laitrams argument that the doctrine of claim_differentiation warranted an interpretation of the` sprocket_recess' limitation that encompassed a single_transverse_element because claim 2 of the518_patent explicitly required opposing transverse_elements
the court disagreed noting that` claim_differentiation is a guide not a rigid rule' and that because the` sprocket_recess' limitation bore` only one interpretation similarity [ between the claims ] will have to be tolerated'
slip op.at a22 citations and internal quotations omitted

working from this claim_construction the court concluded that neither of the accused devices literally infringed the asserted claims and granted kvps motion for summary_judgment of noninfringement
specifically the court determined that neither the` all-in-one' module nor the` fluid_flo' module infringed the claims because each had curved driving_surfaces and accordingly did not meet the` driving surface' limitation
additionally the court determined that the` all-in-one' module had only a single_transverse_element and accordingly did not meet the` sprocket_recess' limitation
the court further concluded that prosecution_history estoppel precluded infringement under the doctrine of equivalents

the court granted laitrams motion for summary_judgment that the claims of its patents were not invalid,5 concluding that even if the evidence were construed` in the light most favorable to kvp [ kvp ] can not show by clear and convincing_evidence that the' asserted claims were invalid
slip op.at a33

laitram appeals the district_courts grant of kvps summary_judgment_motion for noninfringement arguing that the courts claim_construction was erroneous and that the existence of genuinely disputed fact issues precluded summary_judgment of noninfringement under the doctrine of equivalents
kvp cross-appeals the district_courts grant of laitrams summary_judgment_motion that the asserted claims are not invalid
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1 1994

discussion
a
standard of review
literal infringement involves a two-step determination the proper_construction of the asserted claim and a determination whether the claim as properly construed reads on the accused product or method
claim construction is a question of law which we review de novo
markman v. westview instruments inc. 52_f.3d_967 976 34_uspq2d_1321 1326 fed.cir.1995 in banc affd 517_u.s._370 116_s.ct._1384 134_l.ed.2d_577 38_uspq2d_1461_(1996) ; cybor corp. v. fas techs. inc. 138_f.3d_1448_(fed.cir.1998) in banc
when construing a claim a court principally consults the evidence intrinsic to the patent namely the claims themselves the written description portion of the specification and the prosecution_history
see vitronics corp. v. conceptronic inc. 90_f.3d_1576 1582-83 39_uspq2d_1573 1576-77 fed.cir.1996

summary judgment is appropriate when there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law
fed.r.civ.p
56 c
because the parties did not dispute the structure of the accused devices at the district_court or whether there is or is not infringement by those devices once the issue of claim_construction is settled kvps summary_judgment_motion for noninfringement did not implicate any issues of fact
see transmatic inc. v. gulton indus. inc. 53_f.3d_1270 1278 35_uspq2d_1035 1041 fed.cir.1995
instead resolution of the motion turned solely on the legal_question of the proper_construction *1462 of the claims
see gentex corp. v. donnelly corp. 69_f.3d_527 530 36_uspq2d_1667 1669 fed.cir.1995` claim interpretation is a question of law amenable to summary_judgment`
we now review this legal_question

b
infringement
1
the` driving surface' limitation
laitram argues that the district_court erred by construing the phrase` each of said driving_surfaces extending downwardly.. and in the direction of intended_travel' to include only` angled planar' driving_surfaces
instead laitram argues that this phrase should be construed to include curved driving_surfaces like those of the accused devices
in support of its interpretation and by way of attacking the district_courts interpretation laitram asserts the following 1 the courts interpretation erroneously reads the limitations of the disclosed embodiments into the claims which are not expressly limited to planar_driving_surfaces ; 2 the applicants statement during prosecution that` the cylindrically shaped wall of the drive_link of the chain of palmaer.. does not and could not provide the module of the instant_invention having.. a driving surface.. that extends downwardly toward the bottom_surface and in the direction of travel' should not have been relied upon by the district_court because this statement was not relied upon by the examiner in allowing the claims and thus was of no consequence to patentability ; 3 because palmaer was cited during the prosecution of the158_patent the claims must necessarily encompass curved surfaces ; 4 kvp when requesting reexamination of the158_patent` admitted' that the claims encompassed curved surfaces ; and 5 the doctrine of claim_differentiation supports its construction because claim 85 of the518_patent is expressly limited to planar_driving_surfaces

none of laitrams arguments is persuasive and we address each in turn before construing the` driving surface' limitation
first we do not agree that the courts observation that the patents written description discloses only flat_driving_surfaces erroneously reads that structure into the claims
rather the courts observation was merely a starting point for construing the disputed language` extending downwardly.. in the direction of intended_travel'
it is entirely proper to` use the specification in order to determine what the inventor meant by terms and phrases in the claims'
minnesota mining & mfg co. v. johnson & johnson orthopaedics inc. 976_f.2d_1559 1566 24_uspq2d_1321 1327 fed.cir.1992

laitrams second argument that applicants statement which attempted to distinguish his invention over prior_art disclosing curved driving_surfaces was not relied upon by the examiner and is therefore irrelevant to claim_construction is not sustainable under our case law
`` regardless of the examiners motives arguments made during prosecution shed light on what the applicant meant by its various terms'
e.i
du pont de nemours & co. v. phillips petroleum co. 849_f.2d_1430 1438 7_uspq2d_1129 1136 fed.cir.1988
the fact that an examiner placed no reliance on an applicants statement distinguishing prior_art does not mean that the statement is inconsequential for purposes of claim_construction
see id. 849_f.2d_1430 7 uspq2d at 1136

laitrams third argument that the fact that palmaer was cited as prior_art during the prosecution of the158_patent mandates the conclusion that curved driving_surfaces are within the claims is unavailing
when this snap-shot of the prosecution_history is scrutinized in context it becomes clear that nothing transpired which is helpful in construing the disputed claim_language
when palmaer was cited as a ground for rejection of the claims the examiner suggested to the applicant that his claims would be allowed if they were limited to multiple driving_surfaces across the width of the module a feature not taught by palmaer
the applicant acted on this suggestion and his claims were allowed
thus the only conclusion that can be drawn from this portion of the prosecution_history is that the claims are limited to modules having multiple recesses a conclusion irrelevant to the claim_construction issue on appeal.6

laitrams fourth argument that kvp` admitted' during reexamination that the claims were broad enough to encompass curved driving_surfaces is irrelevant to the construction of the claims
it is the applicants representations during prosecution *1463 that potentially shed light on the construction of the claims see e.g. vitronics 90 f.3d at 1582 not the representations of a reexamination requester

laitrams fifth and final argument that claim_differentiation warrants the conclusion that the asserted claims are not unlike claim 85 of the518_patent limited to flat_driving_surfaces is not persuasive
as the district_court properly noted although different claims should be presumed to cover different inventions` if a claim will bear only one interpretation similarity [ with another claim ] will have to be tolerated'
laitram_corp. v. rexnord inc. 939_f.2d_1533 1538 19_uspq2d_1367 1371 fed.cir.1991 quoting autogiro co. of am
v. united states 181_ct.cl._55 384_f.2d_391 404 155_uspq_697 708 1967

here the asserted claims will bear only one interpretation that the` driving surface' limitation is limited to flat_driving_surfaces
while claims are not necessarily limited by the written description it is relevant that nothing in the written description suggests that the driving_surfaces can be anything but flat
indeed the benefits of having flat_driving_surfaces are stated in the` summary of the invention' portion of the written description.7 these observations warrant a conclusion that the` driving surface' limitation` extending downwardly.. and in the direction of intended_travel' requires flat_driving_surfaces
see north am vaccine inc. v. american cyanamid co. 7_f.3d_1571 1576-77 28_uspq2d_1333 1337 fed.cir.1993 noting that the written description requirement of 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
1 warranted a claim_construction that encompassed only the disclosed embodiments
the prosecution_history confirms this conclusion
that history makes clear that the applicant distinguished the cylindrical walls of palmaer from his invention because it did not disclose a` driving surface within the sprocket_recess that extends downwardly toward the bottom_surface and in the direction of travel'
accordingly this limitation can not be construed to cover the cylindrically shaped driving_surfaces of the accused devices
see advance transformer co. v. levinson 837_f.2d_1081 1083 5_uspq2d_1600 1602 fed.cir.1988 a patentees statements to the pto distinguishing his pending applications invention from that of another persons issued patent may be relied on for purposes of construing the patentees claims
the district_courts interpretation of the` driving surface' limitation was not erroneous and it did not err in granting summary_judgment that the accused devices did not literally infringe the asserted claims

2
the` sprocket recess' limitation
laitram argues that the district_court erred in construing the` sprocket_recess' limitation to require` opposing transverse_elements'
instead laitram asserts that only a single_transverse_element is required
according to laitrams proposed interpretation a single_recess of the claims is minimally defined by only one transverse_element and two longitudinal_members such that the recess is not enclosed
laitram explains that the reason the claims require multiple_transverse_elements is because the claimed module requires multiple sprocket_recesses across the width of the module each requiring a single_transverse_element
according to its interpretation the multiple_transverse_elements of the claims are portions of an otherwise single_bar that spans the entire length of the module

we have considered laitrams arguments in support of its claim_construction,8 but we *1464 are not persuaded
instead we agree with the district_courts analysis and its conclusion that the` sprocket_recess' limitation requires two opposing transverse_elements capable of mating with a corresponding sprocket_tooth
in further support of this conclusion the claims require at least two transverse_elements to define the sprocket_recesses
the written description makes clear that these` transverse_elements' are the` transverse_sections' 32_and_34 which span the entire width of the module and in an opposing fashion span several recesses
for example the written description clearly discloses that the recesses are` provided by' the transverse_sections 32_and_34 and the longitudinal_members 30 that intersect them
see158_patent col._3,_ll._37-38
in contrast there is nothing in the written description that supports laitrams assertion that a given transverse_element of the claims should be construed to span only a single_recess

because the` all-in-one' module has a single_transverse_element it does not contain` sprocket_recesses' defined by opposing transverse_elements and therefore does not literally infringe the asserted claims for this additional reason

3
doctrine of equivalents
we also agree with the district_court that summary_judgment of noninfringement under the doctrine of equivalents was proper in this case
although laitram correctly notes that infringement under the doctrine of equivalents is a question of fact see graver tank & mfg co. v. linde air prods co. 339_u.s._605 609 70_s.ct._854 856-57 94_l.ed._1097 85_uspq_328 331 1950 and asserts that material facts remain in dispute concerning the operation of the accused devices laitram is nonetheless precluded from successfully asserting that either of the accused devices infringes under the doctrine

first as to the` driving surface' limitation the applicants unequivocal statement in the prosecution_history that distinguished his invention from those structures disclosing cylindrical surfaces now precludes laitram from asserting that the curved driving_surfaces of the accused devices which the record clearly shows are only trivial variants of the distinguished art infringe under the doctrine of equivalents
see texas instruments inc. v. united states int l trade comm n 988_f.2d_1165 1174 26_uspq2d_1018 1025 fed.cir.1993` unmistakable assertions made by the applicant to the patent and trademark office pto in support of patentability whether or not required to secure allowance of the claim.. may operate to preclude the patentee from asserting equivalency between a limitation of the claim and a substituted structure or process step
`` ; id.at 1173 988_f.2d_1165 26 uspq2d at 1024 noting that whether a patentees equivalency theory is precluded by the assertions made by an applicant during prosecution is a question of law ; litton sys. inc. v. honeywell inc. 140_f.3d_1449 1462 fed.cir.1998 noting that prosecution_history estoppel precludes a patentee from asserting as an equivalent a` trivial variation' of the prior_art over which the invention was distinguished

second laitram can not successfully argue that the single_bar of the` all-in-one' module is equivalent to the` sprocket_recess' limitation
using a single_bar rather than opposing transverse_elements creates a module that produces a different result i.e. a module capable of moving in only one direction rather than two
no reasonable fact finder could conclude that such a difference is an insubstantial difference
see warner-jenkinson co. v. hilton davis chem co. 520_u.s._17 -- -- n. 8 117_s.ct._1040 1053_n._8 137_l.ed.2d_146 41_uspq2d_1865 1875_n._8_(1997)` where the evidence is such that no reasonable jury could determine two elements to be equivalent district_courts are obliged to grant.. summary_judgment
``

c. invalidity
we have additionally reviewed the nine pages of kvps opening brief in which it sets forth nine separate grounds for invalidity of the asserted claims.9 we conclude that the district_court did not err in holding that kvp could not prove invalidity by clear and convincing_evidence and accordingly laitram *1465 was entitled to summary_judgment on this issue
see innovative scuba concepts inc. v. feder indus. inc. 26_f.3d_1112 1115 31_uspq2d_1132 1134 fed.cir.1994` under 35 u.s.c.¡± 282 a patent is presumed valid and one challenging its validity bears the burden of proving invalidity by clear and convincing_evidence
``

conclusion
having considered all of the parties arguments we conclude that the district_courts claim_construction was not in error and that it correctly concluded that the accused devices did not literally infringe the asserted claims
the court did not err in concluding that laitrams doctrine of equivalents theory is precluded as a matter of law
finally we agree with the district_court that kvp could not carry its burden of proving invalidity of the asserted claims by clear and convincing_evidence and that laitram was entitled to summary_judgment on this issue
the decision of the court is therefore

affirmed

in the district_court laitram also asserted that kvp infringed claim 2 of the518_patent and claim 1 of the158_patent but does not appeal the judgment of noninfringement of those claims
2
we refer to the` prosecution_history' without reference to the patent to which it pertains viz. the518 or the158_patent
see jonsson v. stanley works 903_f.2d_812 818 14_uspq2d_1863 1870 fed.cir.1990 when two patents using the same claim term both stem from the same parent patent application the prosecution histories of both are relevant to an understanding of the term in both patents
3
the court also noted that the applicant made several statements relevant to the construction of the phrase` angularly disposed' the precursor to the` extending downwardly.. in the direction of intended_travel' language of the claims
see slip op.at a18 noting that the` extending downwardly' language was added after the claim_language` angularly disposed' was rejected under ¡± 112 as indefinite
however because these statements were made with reference to language different from albeit related to the claim_language on appeal they are not a particularly relevant basis for reviewing the claim_construction reached by the district_court
we accordingly do not rely on statements made during prosecution that are relevant only to the` angularly disposed' claim_language in arriving at our construction of` extending downwardly.. in the direction of intended_travel' and do not address the arguments of the parties that rely on these statements
4
`` scrubbing' refers to rubbing between the sprocket_teeth and the driving_surfaces
see158_patent col._1,_ll._48-50
5
the district_court judge did not expressly order that laitrams motion be granted but his conclusion on this point is clear from the text of his opinion and from the subsequent entry of judgment based upon that opinion which dismissed all of the claims in the case
6
laitram makes a similar argument with respect to the prosecution_history of the reexamination of the518_patent
that argument is similarly unavailing
7
`` the intermediate_section also includes angled surfaces which define sprocket_recesses..
these intermediate sprocket_recesses provide the benefit of minimizing chordal action and scrubbing between the mating surface of the module and the sprocket'
'158_patent col._1,_l._67 to col._2,_l._6
`` the angled surfaces.. of the intermediate_section also serve to present greater surface area to water and/or steam jets which can be located above and below the modules for cleaning of the belt
the angled sections also facilitate visual inspection of the belt'
id. col._3,_l._67 to col._4,_l._3
8
laitram argues that 1 the courts construction erroneously limits the claims to bi-directional_movement despite the express requirement in the claims that movement be in` at least one direction of intended_travel' ; 2 neither the` mating' or` receiving' limitation of the claims requires opposing transverse_elements ; and 3 claim_differentiation supports its construction because claim 2 of the518_patent is expressly limited to opposing transverse_elements
9
specifically kvp alleges that four different claim limitations are objectionable as` new matter' under ¡± 112 that kvps sales of` fused' modules in the mid 1970s invalidates the asserted claims under the` on sale' bar and that four prior_art patents anticipate the asserted claims
