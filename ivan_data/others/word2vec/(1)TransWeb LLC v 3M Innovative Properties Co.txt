synopsis
background competitor brought action against holder of patents for method of producing filtration membranes used in industrial respirators seeking declaratory_judgment of invalidity unenforceability and non-infringement and also asserting a walker_process antitrust_claim
the united_states district court for the district of new_jersey faith s. hochberg j. 16_f.supp.3d_385 entered judgment in favor of competitor and patent holder appealed

holdings the court of appeals hughes circuit_judge held that

evidence established that samples of plasma-fluorinated filtration membrane given out at a trade show was a public_disclosure that invalidated the patents ;

evidence established that patentee engaged in inequitable_conduct in obtaining patents ;

evidence supported competitors antitrust_claim ; and

attorney_fees incurred by competitor defending prior infringement_suit were antitrust_injury and thus could form the basis for treble damages under the clayton_act

opinion
hughes circuit_judge
3m sued transweb for infringement of several patents
transweb sued for declaratory_judgment of invalidity and non-infringement of the patents
a jury found the patents to be invalid based on transwebs prior_public_use of the patented method
in accordance with an advisory_verdict from the jury the district_court found the patents unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct
the jury also found 3m to be liable for a walker_process_antitrust_violation and that attorney_fees were an appropriate antitrust remedy
the district_court awarded approximately $ 26 million to transweb including trebled attorney_fees as antitrust_damages
the primary issues are whether sufficient corroborating evidence exists to support the finding of prior_public_use by transweb and whether the attorney_fees are an appropriate basis for damages under the antitrust_laws in this context
we hold in the affirmative on both issues
for the latter issue we find that transwebs attorney_fees appropriately flow from the unlawful_aspect of 3ms antitrust_violation and thus are an antitrust_injury that can properly serve as the basis for antitrust_damages
for these reasons we affirm the district_courts judgment

i. transweb and 3m are both manufacturers of filters for respirators such as might be worn by workers in a dirty or otherwise contaminated worksite
the filter_media at issue in this case consist of` nonwoven_fibrous_webs' which rely on a` web' of fibers rather than traditional woven material
both transweb and 3m use a process of melting pellets of a filter_material such as polypropylene blowing the melted material into a thin film and then allowing the material to cool and solidify into the nonwoven_fibrous_web

it had been known in the art for some time that a filter_medium could be improved by imparting upon it an electrical_charge
in this way the filter_medium can repel or capture particulates both by mechanical and electromagnetic means
a filter_medium on which a semipermanent electrical_charge has been imparted is referred to as an` electret'

transweb and 3m independently developed a technique for imparting this electret characteristic by using plasma_fluorination
fluorination involves introducing fluorine_atoms into the chemical_structure of the filter_web
previously known techniques involved mixing fluorine_compounds *1300 into the melted filter_material but this proved disadvantageous
instead transweb and 3m both discovered that it would be advantageous to first form the fibrous web and then introduce the fluorine_atoms into the chemical_structure
this technique involves exposing a gaseous fluorine compound to the surface of the filter_web in the presence of plasma
the intense heat and electromagnetic energy introduced by the plasma cause some of the chemical bonds on the surface of the filter_web to break and the fluorine_atoms fill in those bonds to form fluorine_compounds on the surface of the filter_web

plasma-fluorinated filter_media are particularly effective in oily environments where other types of filter_media might perform poorly or quickly degrade
the national institute for occupational_safety and health niosh provides a rating and approval service for oily environment respirators categorizing them as not resistant to oil ; resistant to oil ; or oil proof
the occupational_safety and health administration osha provides regulations governing what niosh rating of respirators must be used in certain types of worksites within the united_states

the present appeal focuses largely on the events surrounding a filtration industry exposition that occurred in late april and early may of 1997
it is uncontested that transwebs founder kumar ogale attended the expo and handed out samples of filter_material
the filter_material included samples of transwebs` t-melt' products an identifier for the general class of melt-blown i.e. nonwoven_fibrous_web media
the primary dispute is whether mr._ogale handed out more specifically samples of the` t-melt p' products which is the specific class of plasma-fluorinated t-melt_products
mr._ogale testified at trial that he did in fact hand out t-melt_p_samples at the expo though no independent documents or testimony evidence this fact
the parties do not contest that if mr._ogale handed out t-melt_p_samples at the expo then they would serve as prior_art to the plasma_fluorination technique of the claimed methods
the expo occurred more than one year prior to the priority date of the patents asserted in this case so any public_disclosure of plasma_fluorination at the expo would be a statutory bar to patentability at least based on that feature

in july of 1998 3m filed u.s. patent application 09/109,497 to which both of u.s
patents 6,397 458_and_6808,551 claim earliest priority
3m asserted both the ¡¬458 and ¡¬551_patent s against transweb
in addition to the plasma_fluorination of nonwoven_fibrous_webs described above the patent family discloses use of` hydro-charging' which is a technique that uses water to impart the electrical_charge on the filter_medium

3m initially filed suit in minnesota against transweb for patent infringement
after 3m voluntarily dismissed that suit due to an apparent personal jurisdiction issue transweb filed suit in new_jersey for declaratory_judgment

the district_court in new_jersey ultimately presented the following issues to a jury infringement of claims 31_and_57 of the ¡¬458_patent ; invalidity for obviousness of claims 31_and_57 ; unenforceability of the ¡¬458 and ¡¬551_patent s due to inequitable_conduct ; walker_process_antitrust_violation based on fraudulent_procurement and subsequent assertion of the ¡¬458 and ¡¬ 551 patents ; sham_litigation antitrust_violation based on assertion of the ¡¬458 and ¡¬551_patent s ; entitlement to lost profits damages for antitrust_violations ; and entitlement to attorney_fees as damages for antitrust_violations
the jury delivered the following verdicts claims 31_and_57 are not infringed ; claims 31_and_57 are invalid ; both patents are unenforceable ; *1301 3m committed a walker_process_violation but not a sham_litigation violation ; and transweb is entitled to lost profits and attorney_fees as antitrust_damages

the district_court entered judgment in accordance with the jury verdicts
3m moved for judgment as a matter of law which the district_court denied

on appeal 3m challenges the district_courts judgment on validity inequitable_conduct and antitrust liability
we address each argument in turn

iii
the jury found both claims of the ¡¬458_patent invalid and the district_court denied 3ms motion for jmol of non-invalidity
3m contests this judgment based on a purported lack of corroboration of mr._ogales public_use testimony and based on alleged non-obviousness of the claims even if there were public_use of the plasma-fluorinated material

a
oral testimony by an interested_party on its own will generally not suffice as` clear and convincing' evidence of invalidity
see lazare_kaplan int l v. photoscribe techs. 628_f.3d_1359 1374 fed.cir.2010 ; price v. symsek 988_f.2d_1187 1194 fed.cir.1993
rather such_oral_testimony must be corroborated by some other evidence
see woodland tr
v. flowertree nursery inc. 148_f.3d_1368 1371 fed.cir.1998
the corroborating evidence can include documents and testimonial_evidence
see lazare_kaplan 628 f.3d at 1374-75 adenta gmbh v. orthoarm inc. 501_f.3d_1364 1371 fed.cir.2007 sandt tech
v. resco metal & plastics corp. 264_f.3d_1344 1350-51 fed.cir.2001
circumstantial evidence can be sufficient
see sandt 264 f.3d at 1351 ; knorr v. pearson 671_f.2d_1368 1373 c.c.p.a.1982
this corroboration_requirement for testimony by an interested_party is based on the sometimes unreliable nature of oral_testimony due to the` forgetfulness of witnesses their liability to mistakes their proneness to recollect things as the party calling them would have them recollect aside from the temptation to actual perjury'
lazare_kaplan 628 f.3d at 1374 quoting washburn & moen mfg co. v. beatem all barbed-wire co. 143_u.s._275 284 12_s.ct._443 36_l.ed._154_(1892)

a` rule of reason' analysis is used to determine the sufficiency of corroboration under which` all pertinent evidence is examined in order to determine whether the inventors story is credible'
sandt 264 f.3d at 1350 quoting price 988 f.2d at 1195 internal_quotation_marks omitted
importantly this analysis` does not require that every detail of *1302 the testimony be independently and conclusively supported' by the corroborating evidence
ohio willow wood co. v. alps south 735_f.3d_1333 1348 fed.cir.2013
such a requirement would indeed be` the antithesis of the rule of reason'
cooper v. goldfarb 154_f.3d_1321 1331 fed.cir.1998
we have generally been most skeptical of oral_testimony that is supported only by testimonial_evidence of other interested persons
compare allergan inc. v. apotex inc. 754_f.3d_952 968 fed.cir.2014 and lacks indus
v. mckechnie vehicle components usa 322_f.3d_1335 1350 fed.cir.2003 with adenta 501 f.3d at 1371-73 and sandt 264 f.3d at 1351-52
we have repeatedly noted that contemporaneous documentary evidence provides greater corroborative value
see medichem s.a. v. rolabo s.l. 437_f.3d_1157 1169-70 fed.cir.2006 ; sandt 264 f.3d at 1350-51 ; finnigan corp. v. int l trade comm n 180_f.3d_1354 1366 fed.cir.1999 ; woodland tr. 148 f.3d at 1373 ; price 988 f.2d at 1196
but there are no hard and fast rules as to what constitutes sufficient corroboration and each case must be decided on its own facts
see sandt 264 f.3d at 1350

we treat the ultimate_determination of whether such_oral_testimony is sufficiently corroborated as a question of fact which we review for clear_error
see fleming v. escort inc. 774_f.3d_1371 1377 fed.cir.2014

3ms arguments against sufficiency of corroboration can be summed up as follows as a legal matter transweb must independently evidence all` material_facts' of the purported invalidating public_use ; and as a factual matter transweb provided no corroborating evidence for one of the material_facts viz. that it was the plasma-fluorinated material that was distributed at the expo

3ms legal argument attempts to lead us to a legal conclusion that this court has repeatedly rejected
3m asks us to focus on one particular detail of the oral_testimony and determine whether that detail is independently evidenced
but we have repeatedly rejected an element-wise attack on corroboration of oral_testimony
see fleming 774 f.3d at 1377 ; ohio willow wood 735 f.3d at 1348 characterizing as` misplaced' an argument that a particular claim feature in oral_testimony was not separately evidenced and finding the argument incompatible with the rule of reason ; lazare_kaplan 628 f.3d at 1373-75 ; adenta 501 f.3d at 1371-73
we stated this in clear terms most recently in fleming fleming is correct that none of the corroborating evidence constitutes definitive_proof of orrs account or discloses each claim limitation as written
but the corroboration_requirement has never been so demanding
it is a flexible rule-of-reason demand for independent_evidence that as a whole makes credible the testimony of the purported prior inventor with regard to conception and reduction to practice of the invention as claimed
fleming 774 f.3d at 1377 citations omitted
as applied to this case our rule of reason analysis requires that independent_evidence taken as a whole makes credible mr._ogales testimony that he distributed the plasma-fluorinated material at the expo

in any event 3ms factual argument that transweb provided no corroborating evidence that it was the plasma-fluorinated material that mr._ogale distributed at the expo is incorrect
the correspondence with fourth state demonstrates that transweb had produced the plasma-fluorinated material at least three months prior to the expo
transwebs own_patent_application filed at the same_time as the expo demonstrates that mr._ogale had *1303 invented and was seeking patent protection for the plasma-fluorinated material at least by the time of the expo
the correspondence with filtration group demonstrates that mr._ogale was sending out samples of the plasma-fluorinated t-melt product shortly after the expo
the numerous correspondences contemporaneous with the filtration group correspondence each accompanying samples of filter_material not specifically identified as t-melt show that mr._ogale was sending out other samples of filter_material that may have been plasma-fluorinated
the correspondence with gerson demonstrates that transweb was offering for sale large quantities of the plasma-fluorinated product within two months of the expo
considered in its totality this body of evidence provides abundant support for the credibility of mr._ogales claim that he distributed the plasma-fluorinated material at the expo
as such we find no clear_error in the district_courts determination that mr._ogales testimony was sufficiently corroborated

b
3m argues that even if transweb publicly used plasma-fluorinated material at the expo the claims are still non-obvious
3ms argument rests on two contentions for claim 31 it was not obvious to use hydrocharging on a plasma-fluorinated material ; and for both claims 31_and_57 objective_indicia demonstrate the non-obviousness of the claims

3m admits that hydrocharging was well-known in the art at least based on u.s. patent 5,496,507 to angadjivand
but 3m notes that the angadjivand_patent counsels against` any unnecessary treatment which might increase [ the filter_materials ] electrical connectivity' including` ultraviolet irradiation'
angadjivand_patent col. 3_ll._26 -30
based on the testimony of both transwebs and 3ms expert_witnesses the filter_material is exposed to some ultraviolet_radiation during plasma_fluorination
but transwebs expert_witness also testified that the amount of ultraviolet_radiation emitted during plasma_fluorination was minimal refuting the notion that the above-quoted passage of the angadjivand_patent would have significantly discouraged a person having ordinary skill in the art from using hydrocharging on plasma-fluorinated material
the jury was free to credit this testimony and conclude based on the evidence presented that claim 31 was obvious
we see no error in this determination

3m further contends that unexpected_results and commercial_success demonstrate the non-obviousness of the claims
for commercial_success 3m relies on a single confused exchange between its attorney and transwebs expert_witness at trial wherein the witness says that he does not know about the commercial_success of 3ms products though maybe he said he did in the past
j.a
2105-06
similarly with unexpected_results 3m relies on a single self-serving annotation in the ¡¬458_patent inventors notebook and a corresponding statement at trial
the jury heard and rejected this evidence in concluding that the claims were obvious
none of these arguments as to objective_indicia demonstrate that the jury was unreasonable in finding the claims obvious so we will not disturb that verdict

iv
the jury reached an advisory_verdict that both the ¡¬458 and ¡¬551_patent s were unenforceable for inequitable_conduct
the district_court reached the same_conclusion
3m contests this judgment on all of the required elements of inequitable_conduct

a judgment of inequitable_conduct requires clear and convincing evidence *1304 of materiality knowledge of materiality and a deliberate decision to deceive
therasense inc. v. becton dickinson & co. 649_f.3d_1276 1290 fed.cir.2011 en banc
except in cases of egregious misconduct the materiality must reach the level of but-for materiality meaning that` the pto would not have allowed a claim had it been aware of the undisclosed prior_art'
id.at 1291-92
intent to deceive may be found only if specific_intent to deceive is` the single most reasonable_inference able to be drawn from the evidence'
id.at 1290
if more than one reasonable_inference is possible` intent to deceive can not be found'
id.at 1290-91
a court` may infer intent from indirect and circumstantial evidence' because` direct evidence of deceptive intent is rare'
id.at 1290

this court reviews the district_courts ultimate_determination of inequitable_conduct for abuse of discretion and underlying factual determinations for clear_error
star scientific v. r.j. reynolds tobacco 537_f.3d_1357 1365 fed.cir.2008

a
the expo samples present a definitional case of but-for materiality
during prosecution of the ¡¬497_application the examiner initially allowed all claims
when 3m notified the examiner of one of the transweb_samples that it had on hand the examiner rejected all claims as obvious over that disclosure and the angadjivand_patent
only when 3m clarified its dubious assertion that the transweb_samples were only received after signing of a confidentiality_agreement and thus were not prior_art did the examiner allow the claims
because the examiner would not have allowed the claims had the transweb_samples been properly disclosed as prior_art the transweb_samples are but-for material

b
the district_court concluded based on a detailed review of the record that marvin jones an inventor for the asserted patents and karl hanson an in-house attorney at 3m both acted with specific_intent to deceive the patent_office as to the transweb_materials
the jury unanimously reached the same_conclusion
while it is not necessary for us to recount the entire treatment of the factual record performed so thoroughly by the district_court see transweb llc v. 3m_innovative_properties_co. 16_f.supp.3d_385 398-407 d.n.j.2014 we note a few particular details that demonstrate that the district_court did not clearly err in finding a specific_intent to deceive on the part of mr._jones and mr._hanson

the record makes abundantly clear that 3m generally and mr._jones particularly were very much aware of the samples transweb was distributing at the expo
a week prior to the expo a group of six 3m_employees was party to a lengthy email coordinating 3ms efforts to gather information from transweb at the expo
the email identified two employees as the` point_people' in gathering information from transweb
j.a
6860
the other parties to the email and their subordinates were to channel any questions through the point_people
one of the point_people had already met with transweb and received` quite a bit of information and non-production samples'
id
the email also included an article from nonwovens industry briefly mentioning transwebs t-melt_products
one of the parties to the email was mr._joness supervisor and she forwarded the email to mr._jones on the day that the expo began
mr._jones attended the expo
while he professed at trial to have no recollection of visiting the transweb booth the district_court found his testimony` simply not credible' and noted that *1305` his demeanor was one of a witness trying to distance himself from any knowledge of transwebs presence and activities at the expo'
transweb 16 f.supp.3d at 399
mr._joness supervisor again sent him an email within a month after the expo detailing the information and samples received from transweb by the point_people
this email noted that transwebs production operations were up and running that it was sending samples to potential clients that 3m already had a small sample and that 3m was expecting a larger sample soon thereafter

further evidence shows that mr._jones knew not only that transweb distributed material at the expo but that it was plasma-fluorinated material
within a year of the expo mr._jones was told directly by an employee of racal-an independent filtration company at the time of the expo that was acquired by 3m in the following year-that transweb had been producing plasma-fluorinated material and that transweb had provided samples of such to racal
the district_court noted that the 3m_employees seemed to proceed with a newfound earnest in preparing their own_patent_application and supporting lab notebooks around this same_time
the racal_employee eventually sent the samples received from transweb to mr._jones identifying them as being plasma-fluorinated
around the same_time another 3m_employee forwarded the original expo planning email to mr._jones and mr._hanson noting that it did not explicitly indicate plasma_fluorination
the district_court found that this email indicated a follow-up to some sort of oral conversation between mr._jones mr._hanson and the other 3m_employee regarding what transweb was distributing at the time of the expo
another 3m_employee later requested samples of the plasma-fluorinated material from transweb on behalf of mr._jones and mr._hanson noting that some of the products had been mentioned in the pre-expo nonwovens industry publication

the district_court found that mr._hanson undertook an intentional scheme to paper over the potentially prior_art_nature of the racal-received samples
the racal_employees received the plasma-fluorinated samples from transweb at latest one month after the expo
therefore these samples were highly relevant to what transweb distributed at the expo
the record casts great doubt on whether racal had received the samples before or after execution of a confidentiality_agreement thereby potentially rendering them public_disclosures and prior_art to the ¡¬497_application
at around the same_time that 3m was requesting further samples from transweb and learning of the potential prior_art_nature of the racal samples mr._hanson sent a confusing letter to mr._ogale purporting to clarify some issues as to the confidentially agreements between transweb and 3m and between transweb and racal
mr._hanson had never had any communication with transweb and the district_court concluded that the only possible purpose for the letter was to get an admission from mr._ogale that the racal-received samples were covered by a confidentiality_agreement even though this point was itself dubious
mr._hanson subsequently did submit this letter to the patent_office as definitive_proof that the transweb_samples were not prior_art to the ¡¬497_application

the district_court noted other circumstantial evidence suggesting a specific_intent by 3m_employees to hide the prior_art_nature of the transweb products
the district_court noted that only after mr._hanson met with the racal_employee did that employee type meeting notes from his original meeting with mr._ogale after the expo
those typed notes contained additional information regarding patents that *1306 had not been in the original handwritten notes
the district_court noted that mr._hanson waited several years between learning of the potential transweb prior_art and informing the patent_office
in fact mr._hanson did not disclose the transweb_material to the patent_office until after negotiations for 3m to purchase transweb had broken down
further mr._hanson waited until the last possible moment when a notice of allowance had already been mailed to submit the transweb_material in a request for continued prosecution
the district_court found mr._hansons testimony at trial attempting to explain this delay wholly incredible

based on these factual findings the district_court concluded that the only reasonable_inference that explains the actions of mr._hanson and mr._jones is that they strategically delayed in disclosing the transweb prior_art and then intentionally made an inaccurate disclosure of that material
we can find no clear_error in this conclusion particularly as the district_courts findings are based in large degree on its determinations that mr._jones and mr._hanson were not credible during relevant parts of their testimony
see in re rosuvastatin calcium patent litig. 703_f.3d_511 521 fed.cir.2012`this court may not reassess and indeed is incapable of reassessing witness credibility and motive issues on review
`` quoting lnp eng g plastics inc. v. miller waste mills inc. 275_f.3d_1347 1361 fed.cir.2001

finding no clear_error in the district_courts determinations on both materiality and specific_intent and finding no other improprieties in the district_courts analysis we see no abuse of discretion in the district_courts ultimate conclusion of unenforceability for inequitable_conduct

v. the jury found that 3m committed a walker_process_antitrust_violation and awarded transweb damages of lost profits and attorney_fees
the district_court denied 3ms motion for jmol
3m contests this judgment based on several purported flaws in market definitions for the antitrust_claim and based on the theory that transwebs attorney_fees are not appropriate antitrust_damages for the walker_process_violation

in walker_process the supreme_court held that a plaintiff could bring an action under ¡± 2 of the sherman_act based on the alleged maintenance and enforcement of a fraudulently-obtained patent
see walker_process equip
v. food mach
& chem corp. 382_u.s._172 173-74 86_s.ct._347 15_l.ed.2d_247_(1965)
in order to prevail on a walker_process claim the antitrust-plaintiff must show two things first that the antitrust-defendant obtained the patent by knowing and willful_fraud on the patent_office and maintained and enforced the patent with knowledge of the fraudulent_procurement ; and second all the other_elements necessary to establish a sherman_act monopolization_claim
see ritz camera & image v. sandisk corp. 700_f.3d_503 506 fed.cir.2012

transwebs monopolization_claim arises under ¡± 2 of the sherman_act as an` attempt to monopolize'
15 u.s.c.¡± 2 2012
the` other_elements' necessary to establish an attempted monopolization_claim are` 1 that the defendant has engaged in predatory or anticompetitive conduct with 2 a specific_intent to monopolize and 3 a dangerous_probability of achieving monopoly_power'
spectrum sports inc. v. mcquillan 506_u.s._447 456 113_s.ct._884 122_l.ed.2d_247_(1993)
in determining the dangerous_probability of achieving monopoly_power for element 3 the courts look at` the relevant_market and the defendants ability to lessen or destroy competition in that market'
id

*1307 in this case 3m does not contest that transwebs inequitable_conduct showing if affirmed along with 3ms bringing of the infringement_suit proves the first walker_process requirement as well as elements 1 and 2 of the second walker_process requirement
we have previously explained that walker_process_liability requires a higher more specific showing of` knowing and willful_fraud' than the more inclusive inequitable_conduct doctrine
nobelpharma ab v. implant innovations 141_f.3d_1059 1069 fed.cir.1998 ; see also dippin dots inc. v. mosey 476_f.3d_1337 1346-48 fed.cir.2007
after therasense the showing required for proving inequitable_conduct and the showing required for proving the fraud component of walker_process_liability may be nearly identical
see e.g. gideon mark & t. leigh anenson inequitable conduct and walker_process claims after therasense and the america invents act 16 u. pa. j
bus
l. 361 402_n._258_(2014)
regardless because 3m does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jurys walker_process fraud finding beyond challenging the inequitable_conduct finding we will accept as admitted that transweb sufficiently demonstrated the walker_process fraud component

instead 3m challenges whether the district_court properly defined the relevant_market for determining dangerous_probability of monopoly_power in element 3 and whether the award of transwebs attorney_fees is appropriate even if the walker_process case were proven

a
the relevant_market is defined by both a product market and a geographic_market

transweb defined two distinct_markets an` upstream' market for` fluorinated polymeric material' and a` downstream' market for niosh-certified respirators in the united_states
3m challenges the scope of the relevant_products for the former and the geographic scope for the latter

i
the relevant product market consists of all products that are` reasonably interchangeable by consumers for the same purposes'
united_states v. e.i
du_pont_de_nemours & co. 351_u.s._377 395 76_s.ct._994 100_l.ed._1264_(1956) ; see also queen city pizza v. dominos pizza 124_f.3d_430 436 3d cir.1997
`` reasonable interchangeability' may be determined by looking at price use and qualities of the products
see e.i
du_pont_de_nemours 351 u.s. at 404 76_s.ct._994 ; tunis bros. co. v. ford motor co. 952_f.2d_715 722 3d cir.1991

3m argues that the district_court erred in limiting the upstream market to fluorinated products
in particular 3m argues that non-fluorinated filter_media such as fiberglass and pleated material are interchangeable with fluorinated_media and that transwebs expert admitted as much

while 3m points to evidence supporting a conclusion that fluorinated material does not form a distinct_market this does not undermine the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jurys conclusion to the contrary
evidence demonstrated that fluorinated material has a lower pressure drop while maintaining high filtration as compared *1308 to other_filter_media ; fluorinated material has a longer service life than other_filter_media ; and customers would pay more for respirators with the fluorinated_media
taken together this evidence provides a sufficient_basis on which a reasonable_jury could conclude that the price use and qualities of fluorinated material render it a distinct_market from other_filter_media

ii
`` the relevant_geographic_market is the area in which a potential buyer may rationally look for the goods or services he or she seeks'
tunis bros. 952 f.2d at 726 quoting pa
dental ass n v. med
serv
ass n of pa. 745_f.2d_248 260 3d cir.1984
`` consequently the geographic_market is not comprised of the region in which the seller attempts to sell its product but rather is comprised of the area where his customers would look to buy such a product'
id.at 726

3m argues that the district_court erred in limiting the downstream market for niosh-certified respirators to the united_states
in particular 3m argues that buyers look to overseas companies to purchase niosh-certified respirators and that transwebs expert testimony on the relevant_geographic_market was without basis

3ms argument is based primarily on an artificial_distinction
by repeatedly pointing to the potential for buyers to purchase niosh-certified respirators from foreign_manufacturers 3m implies that the` united_states' market only includes respirators manufactured in the united_states
but transwebs expert clarified that sales of niosh-certified respirators in the united_states by foreign_manufacturers were already included in his calculations for the` united_states' geographic_market
see j.a
2299
as such the flaw proffered by 3m in the definition of the geographic_market is not present

beyond this artificial_distinction there is also no lack of evidence to support the jurys verdict
the district_court noted that the niosh certifications are relevant to companies operating in the united_states as the united_states osha promulgates regulations regarding the use of niosh-certified respirators by employees
as such the jury could have reasonably concluded that niosh certification is most relevant to buyers in the united_states given that oshas regulations are limited to the united_states
evidence also demonstrated that 3m itself reviewed sales in the united_states market distinct from other markets
finally while 3m notes that transwebs expert did not perform any` calculations' to determine that the united_states is the relevant_geographic_market his testimony was still based on expert opinion on which the jury was entitled to rely
therefore there was a sufficient_basis on which a reasonable_jury could conclude that the united_states was the relevant_geographic_market for the niosh-certified respirators

b
3ms final challenge is to the district_courts award of attorney_fees as antitrust_damages

section 4 of the clayton_act provides that` any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust_laws.. shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained and the cost of suit including a reasonable attorneys fee'
15 u.s.c.¡± 15 a 2012
the jury concluded that transweb was entitled to its lost profits and attorney_fees in recompense for 3ms antitrust_violation
the jury found 3m liable for approximately $ 34,000 in lost profits which the district_court *1309 awarded to transweb as the trebled amount of approximately $ 103,000
after review by a special master the district_court concluded that transweb incurred approximately $ 3.2 million in attorney_fees prosecuting the antitrust_claim and approximately $ 7.7 million defending the infringement_suit
the district_court awarded the $ 3.2 million on a one-for-one basis as` cost of suit' fees
the district_court awarded the $ 7.7 million trebled to approximately $ 23 million as damages
3m does not appeal the lost profits or cost of suit fees

3m argues that the district_court erred in awarding the $ 23 million of attorney-fees damages because transweb failed to show any link between those attorney_fees and an impact on competition
3m argues that those attorney_fees had no effect on competition because they did not force transweb out of the market or otherwise affect prices in the market
on this basis 3m argues that those attorney_fees are not an antitrust_injury and thus can not be a proper basis for antitrust_damages

section 4 of the clayton_act does not provide recompense for any injury causally linked to a violation of the antitrust_laws but rather only for antitrust_injury
see atl richfield co. v. usa petroleum co. 495_u.s._328 334 110_s.ct._1884 109_l.ed.2d_333_(1990) ; brunswick corp. v. pueblo bowl-o-mat inc. 429_u.s._477 489 97_s.ct._690 50_l.ed.2d_701_(1977)
transwebs injury-in-fact of $ 7.7 million must be` attributable to an anti-competitive aspect of the practice under scrutiny' in order to qualify as an antitrust_injury
atl
richfield 495 u.s. at 334 110_s.ct._1884
stated another way transwebs injury-in-fact must` stem [ ] from a competition-reducing aspect or effect of the defendants behavior' not from competition-increasing or competition-neutral aspects
id.at 344 110_s.ct._1884

3ms argument focuses on the fact that the harmful effect on competition proven by transweb at trial never actually came about
transweb proved at trial that increased prices for fluorinated filter_media and respirators would have resulted had 3m succeeded in its suit
however because transweb prevailed these effects never materialized

we do not read the antitrust_injury requirement from atlantic richfield brunswick and similar cases to so narrowly define the scope of antitrust_injury
those cases dealt with situations where the antitrust-defendants actions though unlawful would not have actually reduced competition
see e.g. atl
richfield 495 u.s. at 337-38 110_s.ct._1884 rejecting attempt to recover profits lost due to an increase in competition and reduction in prices caused by vertical maximum-price-fixing arrangement ; cargill inc. v. monfort of colo. inc. 479_u.s._104 114-17 107_s.ct._484 93_l.ed.2d_427_(1986) rejecting attempt to block merger on the theory that the merged companies would increase competition and lower prices ; brunswick 429 u.s. at 487-88 97_s.ct._690 rejecting attempt to recover lost marginal profits that were not achieved because an acquiring company purchased a failing company thus maintaining competition with the antitrust-plaintiff

in this case however 3ms unlawful_act was in fact aimed at reducing competition and would have done so had the suit been successful
3ms unlawful_act was the bringing of suit based on a patent known to be fraudulently obtained
what made this act unlawful under the antitrust_laws was its attempt to gain a monopoly based on this fraudulently-obtained patent
transwebs attorney_fees flow directly from this unlawful_aspect of 3ms act
that is transwebs attorney_fees` flow [ ] from that which makes [ 3ms ] acts unlawful' *1310 brunswick 429 u.s. at 489 97_s.ct._690 and are` attributable to [ this ] anti-competitive aspect of the practice under scrutiny' atl
richfield 495 u.s. at 334 110_s.ct._1884
the` competition-reducing aspect' id.at 344 110_s.ct._1884 of 3ms behavior was its attempt at achieving a monopoly by bringing the subject lawsuit
3ms failure to prevail in that lawsuit does not make the resultant attorney_fees any less attributable to that behavior and the attorney_fees are precisely` the type of loss that the claimed violations would be likely to cause' brunswick 429 u.s. at 489 97_s.ct._690 quoting zenith radio corp. v. hazeltine research inc. 395_u.s._100 125 89_s.ct._1562 23_l.ed.2d_129_(1969) internal ellipses omitted
therefore transwebs attorney_fees are both injury-in-fact and antitrust_injury

3m relies on comcast corp. v. behrend -- - u.s. -- -- 133_s.ct._1426 185_l.ed.2d_515_(2013) as foreclosing transwebs recovery of attorney_fees as antitrust_damages
but 3m relies on comcast primarily to refute transwebs notion that it can separate the antitrust_injury in ¡± 4 from the injury-in-fact used for the basis of damages in ¡± 4
on this point we agree with 3m
section 4 only contemplates a single injury i.e. it does not allow one antitrust_injury and a separate injury-in-fact that is used for the basis of damages
but this flaw in transwebs position does not undo the damages award
transwebs attorney_fees are themselves both injury-in-fact and sufficiently stemming from the competition-reducing aspect of 3ms behavior to qualify as antitrust_injury
the district_court instructed the jury in accordance with this proper interpretation of the law and transweb presented sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that these requirements of ¡± 4 were met

this conclusion is supported by the only persuasive authority that addresses the award of attorney_fees as damages for a walker_process_violation kearney & trecker corp. v. cincinnati milacron inc. 562_f.2d_365 6th cir.1977
in kearney the district_court found the patentee liable under ¡± 2 of the sherman_act based on the walker_process theory of liability
see id.at 372-73
the patentee had obtained a patent through inequitable_conduct and later sued the defendant for infringement of that patent
see id.at 368-69 371-72
the appeals_court held that the defendants attorney_fees could be awarded as ¡± 4 damages even though` [ the defendant ] did not prove direct market place damages resulting from [ the patentees ] anticompetitive acts'
id.at 374-75
the court relied on the reasoning from the district_court that the patentee forced the defendant into a position of having to choose from three alternatives cease competition take a license or defend the infringement_action
see id.at 374
the appeals_court held that` one who has established or is attempting to establish an illegal monopoly by fraud on the patent office or misuse of a patent should not be permitted to further this goal by means of an infringement_suit
when the antitrust_violations are causally connected to the infringement_action it is permissible to include the expenses of defending that action in the award of damages'
id

while a causal connection is no longer a sufficient connection after brunswick 429 u.s. at 489 97_s.ct._690 decided that same year the core logic in kearney is still valid the patentee instigated an anticompetitive_suit that forced the defendant to choose between ceasing_competition taking a disadvantageous position in competition taking a license or defending the suit
because the injury suffered by the antitrust-plaintiff under each choice flows from the anticompetitive aspect of the patent owners behavior each can be recovered as antitrust_damages

*1311 3m had indicated that it would not license its patents to transweb
therefore in response to 3ms anticompetitive infringement_suit transweb had only the options of ceasing_competition altogether or defending the suit
had transweb chosen the first option evidence at trial demonstrated that transweb would have been forced out of the market and higher prices would have resulted
so harmful effects on competition would have resulted and transweb would have undoubtedly suffered antitrust_injury
transweb chose the second option
this prevented the harmful impacts to consumers of the relevant_products but caused transweb to suffer a very real injury of its own the cost of defending the suit
both the lost profits suffered under option one and the attorney_fees suffered under option two were attributable to what made 3ms behavior unlawful i.e. bringing the lawsuit on a fraudulently-obtained patent in pursuit of a monopoly
therefore the injury suffered by transweb under either option qualifies as antitrust_injury and thus can form the basis of damages under ¡± 4

3m criticizes transwebs reliance on cases such as handgards that did not deal with walker_process_violations in particular
according to 3m because some cases relied on by transweb dealt with sham_litigation the holdings are inapposite here
it is true that we have held that sham_litigation and walker_process are distinct avenues by which a party can lose noerr-pennington immunity
see nobelpharma 141 f.3d at 1071-72
in nobelpharma we noted that the supreme_court had declined to explain how sham_litigation and walker_process_liability relate to one another so we declined to merge the two doctrines
see id
( discussing prof l real estate inv'rs inc. v. columbia pictures indus. inc. 508_u.s._49 61_n._6 113_s.ct._1920 123_l.ed.2d_611_(1993)` pre`
we reasoned that the objective baselessness and subjective bad faith requirements for sham_litigation laid out in pre are one way that a party can lose antitrust immunity while the` very specific conduct that is clearly reprehensible' and defined in walker_process is another way
id.at 1071

but that distinction does not make the regional_circuit cases dealing with sham_litigation or other antitrust_violations uninformative *1312 to the present issue of damages
while there are distinctions between the various types of antitrust_violations the logic underlying the award of attorney_fees as antitrust_damages is sufficiently similar to make those holdings relevant in the walker_process context
in particular it is the abuse of the legal_process by the antitrust-defendant that makes the attorney_fees incurred by the antitrust-plaintiff during that legal_process a relevant antitrust_injury
see premier_electric 814 f.2d at 375-76 explaining that fraud in litigation seeks to obtain more than authorized by the political_branches and that` litigation costs incurred to combat the consequences of acts exceeding the authorization granted by the political_branches could be the basis of liability' ; handgards 601 f.2d at 997` in a suit alleging antitrust_injury based upon a bad faith prosecution theory it is obvious that the costs incurred in defense of the prior patent infringement_suit are an injury whichflows from the antitrust wrong`
cf
pre 508 u.s. at 58 113_s.ct._1920` indeed we recognized that recourse to agencies and courts should not be condemned as sham until a reviewing court has discerned and drawn the difficult line separating objectively reasonable claims from a pattern of baseless repetitive claims which leads the factfinder to conclude that the administrative and judicial processes have been abused'
( internal_quotation_marks and modifications omitted

no assertion of a patent known to be fraudulently-obtained can be a proper use of legal_process
no successful outcome of that litigation regardless of how much the patentee subjectively desires it would save that suit from being improper due to its tainted origin
therefore we find the holdings of our sister circuits allowing attorney_fees as antitrust_damages in contexts such as sham_litigation and lawsuits in furtherance of a broader anticompetitive scheme to be persuasive arguments in favor of allowing transweb to recover its attorney_fees as ¡± 4 damages in this case

to conclude otherwise would be contrary to the purpose of the antitrust_laws
the antitrust_laws exist to protect competition
see brown shoe 370 u.s. at 320 82_s.ct._1502 1962
if we were to hold that transweb can seek antitrust_damages only under option one forfeiture of competition but not option two defending the anticompetitive_suit then we would be incentivizing the former over the latter
this would amount to incentivizing transweb to forfeit competition rather than continue it
this is not in accord with the purpose of those very same antitrust_laws

furthermore it furthers the purpose of the antitrust_laws to encourage transweb to bring its antitrust suit under option two instead of waiting to be excluded from the market under option one
if transweb proceeds only after being excluded from the market under option one then the injury-in-fact will no longer be borne by transweb alone but rather would be shared by all consumers in the relevant_markets

for these reasons we find that transwebs attorney_fees incurred defending the infringement_suit are antitrust_injury and thus can form the basis for damages under ¡± 4

vi
based on the foregoing we affirm the district_courts denial of jmol on non-invalidity and on the antitrust counts as well as the district_courts judgment of unenforceability due to inequitable_conduct

affirmed
