linn circuit_judge
this is a patent infringement action concerning the pharmaceutical compound ramipril which is marketed by king_pharmaceuticals inc.` king' as a blood_pressure medication under the name_altacethe_r
lupin_ltd. and lupin_pharmaceuticals inc. collectively` lupin' appeal from a final judgment of infringement entered by the united_states_district_court for the eastern_district of virginia in favor of king and aventis_pharma_deutschland_gmbh` aventis'
aventis_pharma_deutschland_gmbh v. lupin_ltd. no._205-cv-421 2006_wl_2008962 e.d.va
july_17,_2006
the district_court concluded at summary_judgment that lupins filing of an abbreviated new drug application anda for a generic_version of ramipril infringed aventiss u.s._patent
no._5061,722` the ¡¬722_patent` under the doctrine of equivalents and concluded after a bench_trial that the asserted_claims of the ¡¬722_patent were not invalid.1 lupin_appeals from these decisions
aventis cross-appeals from the district_courts decision to dismiss its claim of willful_infringement
for the reasons *1295 that follow we conclude that the subject_matter of the asserted_claims of the ¡¬722_patent would have been obvious
accordingly we reverse
the cross-appeal and the remaining issues raised by the parties are deemed moot and are not addressed

i
background
a
the claimed technology
the patent at issue in this appeal is directed to the pharmaceutical compound ramipril in a formulation` substantially free of other_isomers'
ramipril like many complex organic molecules is one of a family of stereoisomers
as the district_court explained in greater detail in its opinion regarding validity aventis_pharma_deutschland_gmbh v. lupin ltd. no._205-cv-421 2006_wl_2008962 e.d.va
july_17,_2006` invalidity_opinion` an isomer of a compound is a separate compound in which each molecule contains the same constituent atoms as the first compound but with those atoms arranged differently
a stereoisomer is an isomer in which the same atoms are bonded to the same other atoms but where the configuration of those atoms in three dimensions differs
the following structural formula represents ramipril

?
each of the five carbon_atoms marked with an asterisk can be spatially oriented in two different ways.2 for example the dashed triangle leading from the leftmost marked carbon to a hydrogen` h' atom indicates that the hydrogen_atom lies below the planes of the two five-sided rings of which the carbon_atom is a part
the hydrogen_atom may also lie above the planes of the rings resulting in a structure that is a stereoisomer of ramipril
because there are five carbon_atoms that may take either of two orientations-or five` stereocenters' as such atoms are known-ramipril is one of 2 5 or 32 stereoisomers
there are a number of different ways of naming these stereoisomers ; one comparatively simple system used by both parties and by the district_court involves labeling each stereocenter with an` r' or an` s' depending on its configuration
using this system all five stereocenters in ramipril are in the` s' configuration so it is known as an` sssss' or` 5 s' stereoisomer
other stereoisomers would include rrrrr ssssr rrsss etc

some of the prior_art references also use the terms` enantiomer' and` diastereomer'
enantiomers are stereoisomers that are mirror images of each other like left and right hands
diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not enantiomers

the asserted_claims of the ¡¬722_patent read as follows 1
a compound of the formula

*1296. ?
or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof wherein r 2 is hydrogen methyl ethyl or benzyl and wherein hydrogen_atoms on the ring_carbon_atoms in the 1- and 5-positions are in the cis-configuration_relative to one another the carboxyl_group on the ring_carbon_atom in the 3-position is in the endo_position relative to the bicyclic_ring_system and the chirality_centers in the chain and on the ring_carbon_atom in the 3-position all have the s-configuration said compound or salt being substantially free of other_isomers
2
a compound or salt as in claim 1 which is n- 1-s-carboethoxy-3-phenylpropyl -s-alanyl-cis endo-2-azabicyclo- [ 3.3.0 ] -octane-3-s-carboxylic acid or a salt thereof
4
a hypotensive_composition for reducing blood_pressure comprising a hypotensively effective_amount of a compound or salt as in claim 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable_excipient_therefor
5
a method for reducing blood_pressure in a patient which comprises administering to said patient a hypotensively effective_amount of a compound or salt as in claim 1
claim 1 the only independent claim covers a small_genus of compounds each of which has a different functional group at location r 2
the language of the claim` wherein hydrogen_atoms on the ring_carbon_atoms in the 1- and 5-positions are in the cis-configuration_relative to one another the carboxyl_group on the ring_carbon_atom in the 3-position is in the endo_position relative to the bicyclic_ring_system and the chirality_centers in the chain and on the ring_carbon_atom in the 3-position all have the s-configuration' limits claim 1 and thus all the other claims to the 5 s stereoisomer
when the r 2 functional group is ethyl the compound of claim 1 is ramipril
this is the compound claimed specifically by claim 2
b
the development of ramipril
ramipril is one of a family of drugs known as` angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors' or` ace_inhibitors'
ace_inhibitors inhibit a biochemical pathway that constricts blood vessels and therefore are useful for treating high_blood_pressure
the earliest ace_inhibitors dating back to the late 1960s were based on the venom of the brazilian viper which was known to reduce blood_pressure
the active compound isolated from viper venom known as bpp5a has six stereocenters all of which are in the s_configuration
synthetic ace_inhibitors have been developed by making structural modifications to this venom and to successive generations of ace_inhibitors
for example captopril the first synthetic ace inhibitor consists of part of the bpp5a molecule with a sulfur atom at the end
captopril retains two stereocenters from bpp5a both of which remain in the s_configuration

ramiprils immediate predecessor is an ace inhibitor known as enalapril that was introduced by merck in 1980
enalapril has three stereocenters
in a published *1297 article merck scientists explained that the all-s sss stereoisomer of enalapril was found to have 700 times the potency of the ssr stereoisomer
a.a. patchett et al. a new class of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors 288_nature_280_(nov._20,_1980) available at j.a
15475
the merck_article taught how to separate the all-s isomer using standard chromatography techniques

both aventis and its competitor schering sought to create new ace_inhibitors based on enalapril
soon after enalaprils introduction dr. elizabeth smith a chemist at schering conceived of the structure of ramipril and recorded it in her laboratory_notebooks
ramipril has the same overall structure as enalapril with one distinction where ramipril has two linked five-sided carbon rings a` 5,5 fused ring_system' depicted in the chemical_diagrams above on the left side of the molecule enalapril has only a single ring
the addition of the second ring gives rise to two more stereocenters than are present in enalapril ; thus ramipril has the same three stereocenters as enalapril plus two new ones that span the fused ring_system and are therefore known as` bridgehead' carbons for a total of five as discussed above

based on the work of dr._smith schering filed u.s._patent_application_no._06 /199,886` the ¡¬886 application' on october 23 1980
thereafter the u.s._patent and trademark office` pto' granted schering patent no._4587,258` the ¡¬258_patent' issued may_6,_1986 and no._5348,944` the ¡¬944_patent' issued sept._20,_1994 both claiming priority from the ¡¬886 application via a series of continuations and continuations-in-part
the ¡¬886 application the ¡¬258_patent and the ¡¬944_patent disclose the structure of ramipril but do not describe how its stereocenters should be configured

example 20 of the ¡¬886 application discloses a method for making ramipril and is contained in the published specification of the ¡¬944_patent
¡¬944_patent col._15,_ll._1-15
the title of example 20 encompasses only eight of the 32 stereoisomers of ramipril but there is some suggestion in the record that in fact example 20 would have produced only four stereoisomers in practice
invalidity_opinion at 22-23
the district_court described one of the experts testifying on the topic as` somewhat credible' and did not make any explicit findings as to which stereoisomers example 20 would create
id.at 23
for purposes of this appeal it is sufficient to observe that it is uncontested that example 20 yields a mixture of several but not all stereoisomers of ramipril one of which is the 5 s form
it appears likely that in some of these stereoisomers the` bridgehead' carbons are in the r configuration

in february 1981 dr._smith synthesized a mixture of 5 s -configuration ramipril and its ssssr_stereoisomer which mixture came to be known as sch 31925
to make sch 31925 smith followed the process disclosed in example 20 with one` tweak' she used a catalytic hydrogenation step instead of the mercuric acetate oxidation step taught by example 20
the record is unclear as to why smith used that step but there has been no showing that smith was attempting to select particular_stereoisomers
however the district_court found and aventis does not dispute on appeal that sch 31925-the product of the process as modified by smith-contains exactly two isomers the 5 s and ssssr_forms and was successfully produced by dr._smith
in both the 5 s and ssssr_forms the two` bridgehead' carbons are in the s_configuration
in light of the teachings of example 20 dr._smiths written laboratory_notebooks and the test results that dr._smith obtained within weeks of sch 31925s synthesis we *1298 see no clear_error in the district_courts findings that dr._smith had conceived of the various stereoisomers and appreciated which of them sch 31925 contained
see id.at 22-23 68-69
moreover in vivo testing completed by the end of march 1981 confirmed the mixtures therapeutic activity as well as its stereochemistry
we agree with the district_court that dr._smith did not separate the 5 s and ssssr isomers and there is no evidence that she conceived of a purified formulation containing only 5 s ramipril
id.at 69

in october 1981 dr. volker teetz an aventis chemist also synthesized ramipril
id.at 23
on november 5 1981 aventis filed a german precursor to the application that would become the ¡¬722_patent -in-suit
on november 3 1982 aventis filed the first in a chain of u.s. patent applications that led to the ¡¬722_patent
in all these applications aventis claimed the benefit of the german application
there is no dispute that aventis is entitled to the november 5 1981 priority_date

on may_6,_1986 scherings ¡¬258_patent issued
shortly thereafter schering granted aventis a royalty-bearing license under the ¡¬258_patent
around the same time the pto declared interference no._101833 between the ¡¬258_patent and a pending continuation application belonging to aventis
the interference settled
schering agreed to reduce aventiss royalty payment and to disclaim some of its patent claims
in exchange aventis conceded priority as to the primary subject_matter of the ¡¬258_patent -the structure production and therapeutic use of ramipril without specification of particular_stereoisomers
aventis retained the right to prosecute its application as to the 5 s stereoisomer of ramipril in formulations` substantially free of other_isomers' which it contended and still contends represents a separately patentable invention

the dispute about patent rights having been resolved between schering and aventis aventis proceeded to seek fda approval of ramipril apparently in a substantially pure 5 s form
on january 28 1991 the fda granted approval and aventis began to sell ramipril under the name_altacethe_r
acting as scherings agent aventis sought and obtained an extension of the ¡¬258_patents term on the basis of the period of regulatory review by the fda

on october 29 1991 the ¡¬722_patent issued

c. procedural history
the ¡¬258_patent expired on january 27 2005
on march_18,_2005 lupin filed an anda seeking approval for a generic_version of ramipril
in response pursuant to 35 u.s.c.¡± 271 e 2 a aventis sued lupin for infringement including willful_infringement of the ¡¬722_patent in the united_states_district_court for the eastern_district of virginia

the district_court granted lupins rule 12 c motion for judgment on the pleadings as to aventiss claim for willful_infringement and dismissed that claim leaving only counts alleging non-willful_infringement
aventis_pharma_deutschland_gmbh v. lupin ltd. 409_f.supp.2d_722_(e.d.va.2006)
after construing the claims see aventis_pharma_deutschland_gmbh v. lupin ltd. no._205-cv-421 2006_wl_1314413_(e.d.va._may_11,_2006) the district_court considered the issue of infringement pursuant to motions filed by both sides for summary_judgment
the district_court declined to grant summary_judgment to either party as to literal infringement finding disputed issues of material fact as to whether lupins formulation of ramipril was` substantially free of other_isomers'
*1299 aventis_pharma_deutschland_gmbh v. lupin ltd. no._205-cv-421 slip op.at 11-16 2006_wl_1582412_(e.d.va._june_5,_2006)
however the district_court granted summary_judgment of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents subject to a subsequent ruling as to the ¡¬ 722 patents validity
id

the district_court then held a bench_trial on validity
during the trial the district_court orally granted aventiss motion for judgment as a matter of law that the ¡¬722_patent was not unenforceable for inequitable conduct
on july_17,_2006 the district_court issued its opinion on validity concluding that the ¡¬722_patent was neither anticipated nor obvious
invalidity_opinion at 87
although the district_court` reache [ d ] this decision reluctantly' and observed that` [ i ] f the standard.. had been by a preponderance of the evidence rather than by clear and convincing_evidence the court might have determined this case in lupins favor' id.at 1-2 the court concluded that the prior_art did not teach ramipril` substantially free of other_isomers' nor would a person of ordinary_skill in the art` have necessarily been motivated to isolate ramipril in the 5 s configuration substantially free of other_isomers' id.at 75

lupin_appeals
aventis cross-appeals asserting error in the district_courts finding that the filing of an anda can not give rise to willful_infringement
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

ii
discussion
a
the relevant prior art
the record contains a litany of potential prior_art references only some of which are summarized in part i.b above and the prosecution histories of both the ¡¬722_patent and scherings ramipril patents are complex
accordingly and because aventis challenges the prior_art_status of a number of the references that lupin cites we begin by identifying and describing the references on which our decision depends and explaining why we consider them to be prior_art

least controversial are the various references regarding bpp5a captopril and enalapril
it is uncontested that these references were publicly disclosed or published well before the development of ramipril and that both scherings and aventiss efforts towards developing ramipril were based on this body of earlier knowledge
notably all of the stereocenters in the most therapeutically active stereoisomers of these prior_art_compounds are in the s_configuration and this fact was taught by among other references mercks enalapril article in nature

unlike these earlier references however aventis challenges the prior_art_status of the ¡¬944_patent3 the ¡¬944_patent it observes is a continuation-in-part of scherings u.s._patent_application_no._06 /258,484` the ¡¬484_application' itself a continuation-in-part of the ¡¬886 application
because schering had abandoned the ¡¬484_application before the ¡¬ 944 patents filing date aventis argues 35 u.s.c.¡± 120 bars the ¡¬ 944 patent from benefiting from the earlier ¡¬886 filing date
lupin responds that the pto cured this defect by reviving the ¡¬484_application nunc pro tunc
we need not and do not decide aventiss challenge on this ground however because aventis presents it for the first time on appeal
in the district_court the ¡¬944_patent was relied upon as prior_art and its status went unchallenged
accordingly the issue is waived
see *1300 sage prods. inc. v. devon indus. inc. 126_f.3d_1420 1426 fed.cir.1997
we thus consider the ¡¬944_patent entitled to the ¡¬886 filing date and treat it as prior_art to the ¡¬722_patent
the ¡¬944_patent discloses example 20 and also contains the following teaching` when diastereomeric_products result from the synthetic procedures the diastereomeric_products can be separated by conventional chromatographic or fractional_crystallization_methods'
¡¬944_patent col._10,_ll._28-31

finally we rely as did the district_court on dr._smiths synthesis of sch 31925 which qualifies as prior_art under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 g as of a date no later than the end of march 1981 several months before aventiss own synthesis of ramipril
see e.i
du pont de nemours & co. v. phillips petroleum co. 849_f.2d_1430 1436-37 fed.cir.1988 discussing use of ¡± 102 g prior_art in ¡± 103 obviousness determinations
section 102 g affords prior_art_status to an` invention [ that ] was made in this country by another inventor who had not abandoned suppressed or concealed it'
35 u.s.c.¡± 102 g
aventis argues that dr._smith` abandoned suppressed or concealed' sch 31925 but we see no error in the district_courts implicit rejection of this argument
a very similar method to the one dr._smith used had already been disclosed in the ¡¬886_patent application the exact method was subsequently disclosed in the ¡¬258_patent and the composition was developed in the course of extensive ongoing research and development and concurrent ongoing patent prosecution
there has been no showing either that smith` intentionally suppress [ ed ] or conceal [ ed ] h [ er ] invention' or that an` inference of suppression or concealment can be drawn based on an unreasonable delay in making the invention publicly known'
flex-rest llc v. steelcase inc. 455_f.3d_1351 1358 fed.cir.2006
accordingly sch 31925-a mixture of 5 s ramipril with its ssssr_stereoisomer-is part of the prior_art

b. obviousness of claims 1_and_2
we turn to the question of obviousness
`` obviousness is a question of law reviewed de novo based upon underlying factual questions which are reviewed for clear_error following a bench_trial'
alza corp. v. mylan labs. inc. 464_f.3d_1286 1289 fed.cir.2006
the key question is whether the 5 s stereoisomer of ramipril in a form substantially free of other_isomers,4 would have been obvious over the prior_art listed above to one of ordinary_skill in the art at the time of the ¡¬722_patents priority_date
see 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a
such a composition is precisely the subject_matter of claim 2 of the ¡¬722_patent but the question is dispositive of the obviousness of claim 1 as well because claim 1 is to a broader genus containing the same subject_matter
see e.g. eli lilly & co. v. barr labs. inc. 251_f.3d_955 971 fed.cir.2001 noting that a` genus claim limitation is anticipated by and therefore not patentably distinct from [ a ] species claim'

the district_court held that lupin failed to meet its burden of proof by clear and convincing_evidence that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have been motivated to purify 5 s ramipril into a composition substantially free of other_isomers
invalidity_opinion at 74-75
the district *1301 court saw this as a close case based principally on the absence of a clear and convincing showing of motivation
since the date of that decision however the supreme court decided ksr international co. v. teleflex inc. 550u.s
398 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007) which counsels against applying the` teaching suggestion or motivation'` tsm' test as a` rigid and mandatory formula [ ]'
see ksr 127 s.ct.at 1741
it remains necessary to show`some articulated reasoning with some rational underpinning to support the legal conclusion of obviousness` but such reasoning` need not seek out precise teachings directed to the specific subject_matter of the challenged claim'
see id
( quoting in re kahn 441_f.3d_977 988 fed.cir.2006
requiring an explicit_teaching to purify the 5 s stereoisomer from a mixture in which it is the active_ingredient is precisely the sort of rigid application of the tsm test that was criticized in ksr

in the chemical arts we have long held that` structural similarity between claimed and prior_art subject_matter proved by combining references or otherwise where the prior_art gives reason or motivation to make the claimed compositions creates a prima_facie_case of obviousness'
takeda chem indus. ltd. v. alphapharm pty. ltd. 492_f.3d_1350 1356 fed
cir.2007 quoting in re dillon 919_f.2d_688 692 fed.cir.1990 en banc ; see also in re papesch 50_c.c.p.a._1084 315_f.2d_381_(1963)
the` reason or motivation' need not be an explicit_teaching that the claimed compound will have a particular utility ; it is sufficient to show that the claimed and prior_art_compounds possess a` sufficiently close relationship.. to create an expectation' in light of the totality of the prior_art that the new compound will have` similar_properties' to the old
dillon 919 f.2d at 692 ; see also in re wilder 563_f.2d_457 460 c.c.p.a.1977` [ o ] ne who claims a compound per se which is structurally similar to a prior_art compound must rebut the presumed expectation that the structurally similar compounds have similar_properties`
once such a prima_facie_case is established it falls to the applicant or patentee to rebut it for example with a showing that the claimed compound has unexpected properties
dillon 919 f.2d at 692

the analysis is similar where as here a claimed composition is a purified form of a mixture that existed in the prior_art
such a purified compound is not always prima_facie obvious over the mixture ; for example it may not be known that the purified compound is present in or an active_ingredient of the mixture or the state of the art may be such that discovering how to perform the purification is an invention of patentable weight in itself
however if it is known that some desirable property of a mixture derives in whole or in part from a particular one of its components or if the prior_art would provide a person of ordinary_skill in the art with reason to believe that this is so the purified compound is prima_facie obvious over the mixture even without an explicit_teaching that the ingredient should be concentrated or purified
see in re may 574_f.2d_1082 1090-94 c.c.p.a.1978 holding isolated stereoisomer nonobvious over racemic_mixture of stereoisomers after conceded prima_facie showing of obviousness because isolated stereoisomer was unexpectedly nonaddictive ; in re adamson 47_c.c.p.a._839 275_f.2d_952 954-55 1960 holding isolated stereoisomer obvious over racemic_mixture of stereoisomers given insufficient showing of any unexpected result ; see also in re merz 25_c.c.p.a._1314 97_f.2d_599 601 1938 holding prior to the enactment of ¡± 103 that an applicant` is not entitled to a patent on [ an ] article which after being produced has a greater degree of purity than the product *1302 produced by former methods' unless the purification results in` properties and characteristics which were different in kind from those of the known product rather than in degree'
ordinarily one expects a concentrated or purified ingredient to retain the same properties it exhibited in a mixture and for those properties to be amplified when the ingredient is concentrated or purified ; isolation of interesting compounds is a mainstay of the chemists art
if it is known how to perform such an isolation doing so` is likely the product not of innovation but of ordinary_skill and common sense'
ksr 127 s.ct.at 1742

the record suggests that when dr._smith synthesized sch 31925 she understood that the 5 s form of ramipril was the mixtures therapeutically active_ingredient
even if she did not however the prior_art provides a sufficient reason to look to the 5 s configuration
the sch 31925 composition contained only the 5 s and ssssr_stereoisomers of ramipril
importantly these forms differ by the configuration of only one carbon_atom and that atom is not one of the` bridgehead' carbons
rather that carbon_atom is in the part of the ramipril_molecule that is common to the enalapril molecule
in enalapril as in captopril and bpp5a before it all of the stereocenters are in the s_configuration ; the merck_article taught that the sss_configuration of enalapril is 700 times as potent as the ssr form
the close structural analogy between 5 s and ssssr_ramipril and sss and ssr enalapril would have led a person of ordinary_skill to expect 5 s and ssssr_ramipril to differ similarly in potency
moreover the ¡¬944_patent specifically taught that stereoisomers of ramipril` can be separated by conventional chromatographic or fractional_crystallization_methods'
¡¬944_patent col._10,_ll._28-31
aventiss protestations notwithstanding there is no evidence that separating 5 s and ssssr_ramipril was outside the capability of an ordinarily skilled artisan

aventis attempts to rebut this prima_facie_case of obviousness by arguing that purified 5 s ramipril exhibited unexpected_results in the form of increased potency
in support aventis points to the district_courts finding that 5 s ramipril is 18 times as potent as the next most potent isomer the rrsss_form
invalidity_opinion at 44
aventis is correct that on the basis of the record the rrsss and 5 s forms might have been expected to have comparable potencies ; both of them have only s-configured stereocenters in the part of the ramipril_molecule that is common to enalapril as the r stereocenters in the rrsss_form are the` bridgehead' carbons
this however is the wrong comparison
the prior_art supporting prima_facie obviousness included the sch 31925 mixture and so aventis must show that 5 s ramipril had unexpected_results not over all of its stereoisomers but over that mixture which did not contain the rrsss_form
and the potency of pure 5 s ramipril is precisely what one would expect as compared to a mixture containing other inert or near-inert stereoisomers
all evidence suggests and the district_court found that potency varies with the absolute amount of the 5 s isomer in a mixture
invalidity_opinion at 37
that is a 30 milligram_dose of a mixture that is ?
5 s ramipril has the same effectiveness as a 10 milligram_dose of pure 5 s ramipril
id
aventis has thus failed to show unexpected_results that would tend to rebut a prima_facie_case of obviousness
see pfizer v. apotex 480_f.3d_1348 1368-69 fed.cir.2007 holding obvious a patent claim to amlodipine besylate over prior_art disclosing the small_genus of pharmaceutically acceptable amlodipine salts where there was an insufficient showing that the properties of amlodipine besylate purportedly superior for *1303 the purpose of mass-manufacturing tablets were unexpectedly superior to other obvious-to-try salts ; cf
forest labs. inc. v. ivax pharms. inc. 501_f.3d_1263 1269-70 fed.cir.2007 holding that prima_facie obviousness of a claim to a particular_stereoisomer over a racemic_mixture was rebutted where the particular_stereoisomer showed unexpected benefits and evidence indicated that the isomers would have been difficult for a person of ordinary_skill in the art to separate

in sum we hold that claims 1_and_2 of the ¡¬722_patent which cover the 5 s stereoisomer of ramipril in a composition substantially free of other_isomers are invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 over the sch 31925 mixture the ¡¬ 944 patent and the enalapril references in the prior_art

c. obviousness of claims 4_and_5
two asserted_claims of the ¡¬722_patent remain for discussion
claim 4 addresses a` hypotensive_composition' of the compound in claim 1` comprising a hypotensively effective_amount' of the compound` and a pharmaceutically acceptable_excipient_therefor'
claim 5 addresses a` method for reducing blood_pressure' by administering the compound of claim 1
the parties argue this case by discussing the invalidity of the ¡¬722_patent as a whole but` we must evaluate obviousness on a claim-by-claim basis'

however the parties do not challenge the district_courts observation that` all the claims rise or fall with the validity of claim 1' invalidity_opinion at 17 and with good reason
the added limitations of claims 4_and_5 appear almost verbatim in virtually all the prior_art patents including the ¡¬944_patent and its parent ¡¬886 application
e.g. ¡¬944_patent claims 3-4 col._36,_ll._43-52
the prior_art thus reveals that it was well understood by ordinarily skilled artisans that ace_inhibitors were to be used in the manner these claims describe
accordingly we hold that claims 4_and_5 of the ¡¬722_patent are also invalid as obvious

iii
conclusion
having concluded that all asserted_claims of the ¡¬722_patent are invalid as obvious we need not reach lupins remaining arguments in favor of reversal
likewise aventiss cross-appeal is moot
because lupin is entitled to entry of judgment in its favor the judgment of the district_court is

reversed

aventis is the owner of the ¡¬722_patent and king is its exclusive licensee
both parties are plaintiff-cross appellants
for convenience and because aventis and king have adopted each others arguments on appeal pursuant to fed

as is customary in chemical_diagrams carbon_atoms may be indicated by an intersection of two line segments ; in such cases hydrogen_atoms that are bonded to the carbons may be omitted from the diagram for simplicity and should be inferred

aventis also challenges the prior_art_status of the ¡¬258_patent on the ground that it is a continuation-in-part containing previously undisclosed new matter
we need not resolve this issue because we do not rely on the ¡¬258_patent

we note that the parties dispute the claim construction of` substantially free of other_isomers'
we need not address this question directly however because their dispute centers on how much of another isomer a composition might contain while still remaining` substantially free of other_isomers'
whatever the answer to this question might be it is undisputed that sch 31925 and the other mixtures of ramipril isomers in the prior_art are mixtures that are not substantially free of isomers other than the 5 s form whereas the claimed composition of 5 s ramipril is ipso facto` substantially free' enough
