oddzon_products inc. appeals from the decision of the united_states_district_court for the northern_district of california granting summary_judgment in favor of defendants just_toys inc. lisco inc. and spalding & evenflo_companies inc. collectively` just_toys' on oddzons claims of design_patent_infringement trade_dress_infringement and state-law_unfair_competition

oddzon prods. inc. v. just_toys inc. no._95- cv-1077 n.d.cal
july_29,_1996
because oddzon has failed to demonstrate that a reasonable_jury could find that just_toys tossing_balls infringe oddzons design_patent or protectable_trade_dress and derivatively that there was unfair_competition we affirm the district_courts judgment in favor of the defendant just_toys
because no reasonable_jury could conclude other than that the patented_design is ornamental novel and nonobvious we affirm the district_courts judgment that the patent was not proved invalid

background
oddzon is a toy and sporting goods_company that sells the popular` vortex' tossing ball a foam football-shaped ball with a tail and fin structure
the vortex_ball is oddzons commercial_embodiment of its design_patent u.s. patent d 346,001 which issued on april_12,_1994
figure 1 of the patent is shown below

?
fig._1

just_toys inc. another toy and sporting goods_company sells a competing line of` ultra pass' balls
two versions of the allegedly infringing ultra pass balls are shown below

*1400. ?
-- -- -

oddzon sued just_toys for design_patent_infringement trade_dress_infringement and state-law_unfair_competition asserting that the ultra pass line of tossing_balls was likely to be confused with oddzons vortex_ball and that the ultra pass packaging was likely to be confused with the vortex packaging
just_toys denied infringement and asserted that the patent was invalid
on cross-motions for summary_judgment the district_court held that the patent was not shown to be invalid and was not infringed
the court also held that just_toys did not infringe oddzons trade_dress

the district_court determined that two confidential_designs* that had been disclosed to the inventor qualified as subject_matter encompassed within the meaning of 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 f 1994 and concluded that these designs could be combined with other_prior_art designs for purposes of a challenge to the validity of the patent under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 1994
nonetheless the district_court held that the patented_design would not have been obvious in light of the prior_art including the two confidential_designs
the court construed the single claim of the patent as being directed to the design for

a ball shaped like a football with a slender straight tailshaft projecting from the rear of the football
in addition the001_patent design has three fins symmetrically arranged around the tailshaft each of which has a gentle curve up and outward which creates a fin with a larger surface area at the end furthest from the ball
the fins flare outwardly along the entire length of the tailshaft with the front end of the fin extending slightly up along the side of the football so that the fins seemingly protrude from the inside of the football
after construing the claim the court held that the patented_design was not dictated solely by function and thus that it was not invalid on that ground
it also held that oddzon failed to present sufficient_evidence to allow a reasonable_jury to find infringement
the district_court considered oddzons proffered consumer survey_evidence of similarity but held that it was not probative on the question whether the accused balls were substantially similar to the patented_design in terms of its protectable features i.e. its ornamental_features
the district_court concluded that the survey_evidence demonstrated nothing more than that any ball with a tail and fins regardless of its ornamental_features would appear to be similar to the patented_design

the court found that oddzons proffered testimony from an expert was also not probative of any similarity between the ornamental_features of the accused balls and the patented_design
it noted that the bases for the experts conclusion of similarity were unclear and that the legal standards applied to reach that conclusion were not apparent
the court excluded evidence of` actual_confusion' stating that there was no basis to determine that the mistaken_return of twenty-one of the *1401 accused balls to oddzon would not have been typical in the industry absent` confusion'
furthermore it stated that there was no way of determining whether the ornamental_features caused the` confusion'

the district_court also held that the accused balls and their packaging did not violate oddzons protectable_trade_dress rights
holding that oddzons evidence was not probative of consumer_confusion regarding the source of the accused balls the court granted just_toys motion for summary_judgment
because the court found no likelihood of confusion it did not reach the issues of inherent_distinctiveness or secondary_meaning
finally determining that californias unfair_competition law is` substantially congruent' to trademark infringement law the question being whether there is a likelihood of confusion with regard to source the court ruled that oddzons state-law claim must fall with its federal trade_dress claims
oddzon appeals and just_toys cross-appeals the grant of the respective summary_judgment motions

discussion
we review a district_courts grant of summary_judgment de novo
conroy v. reebok int l ltd. 14_f.3d_1570 1575 29_uspq2d_1373 1377 fed.cir.1994
summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine_issue as to any material_fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law

a
the prior art status of ¡± 102 f subject matter
the district_court ruled that two confidential ball designs the` disclosures' which` inspired' the inventor of the oddzon design were prior_art for purposes of determining obviousness under ¡± 103
the district_court noted that this court had recently declined to rule definitively on the relationship between ¡± 102 f and ¡± 103 see lamb-weston inc. v. mccain foods ltd. 78_f.3d_540 544 37_uspq2d_1856 1858-59 fed.cir.1996 but relied on the fact that the united states patent and trademark office pto interprets prior_art under ¡± 103 as including disclosures encompassed within ¡± 102 f
oddzon challenges the courts determination that subject_matter encompassed within ¡± 102 f is prior_art for purposes of an obviousness_inquiry under ¡± 103
oddzon asserts that because these disclosures are not known to the public they do not possess the usual hallmark of prior_art which is that they provide actual or constructive public_knowledge
oddzon argues that while the two disclosures constitute patent-defeating subject_matter under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 f they can not be combined with` real' prior_art to defeat patentability under a combination of ¡± 102 f and ¡± 103

the prior_art_status under ¡± 103 of subject_matter derived by an applicant for patent within the meaning of ¡± 102 f has never expressly been decided by this court
we now take the opportunity to settle the persistent question whether ¡± 102 f is a prior_art_provision for purposes of ¡± 103
as will be discussed although there is a basis to suggest that ¡± 102 f should not be considered as a prior_art_provision we hold that a fair reading of ¡± 103 as amended in 1984 leads to the conclusion that ¡± 102 f is a prior_art_provision for purposes of ¡± 103

section 102 f provides that a person shall be entitled to a patent unless` he did not himself invent the subject_matter sought to be patented'
this is a derivation provision which provides that one may not obtain a patent on that which is obtained from someone else whose possession of the subject_matter is inherently` prior'
it does not pertain only to public_knowledge but also applies to private communications between the inventor and another which may never *1402 become public
subsections a b e and g on the other_hand are clearly prior_art_provisions
they relate to knowledge manifested by acts that are essentially public
subsections a and b relate to public_knowledge or use or prior patents and printed publications ; subsection e relates to prior filed applications for patents of others which have become public by grant ; and subsection g relates to prior inventions of others that are either public or will likely become public in the sense that they have not been abandoned suppressed or concealed
subsections c and d are loss-of-right provisions
section 102 c precludes the obtaining of a patent by inventors who have abandoned their invention
section 102 d causes an inventor to lose the right to a patent by delaying the filing of a patent_application too long after having filed a corresponding patent_application in a foreign country
subsections c and d are therefore not prior_art_provisions

in in re bass 59_c.c.p.a._1342 474_f.2d_1276 1290 177_uspq_178 189 ccpa 1973 the principal_opinion of the court of customs and patent appeals held that a prior invention of another that was not abandoned suppressed or concealed 102 g prior_art could be combined with other_prior_art to support rejection of a claim for obviousness under ¡± 103
the principal_opinion noted that the provisions of ¡± 102 deal with two types of issues those of novelty and loss-of-right
it explained` three of [ the subsections ] a e and g deal with events prior to applicants invention date and the other b with events more than one year prior to the u.s. application date
these are theprior_art subsections'
id
( emphasis in original
the principal_opinion added in dictum ¡± 102 f not being at issue that` [ o ] f course c d and f have no relation to ¡± 103 and no relevancy to what isprior_art under ¡± 103'
id
there is substantial logic to that conclusion
after all the other prior_art_provisions all relate to subject_matter that is or eventually becomes public
even the` secret prior_art' of ¡± 102 e is ultimately public in the form of an issued patent before it attains prior_art_status

thus the patent laws have not generally recognized as prior_art that which is not accessible to the public
it has been a basic principle of patent law subject to minor exceptions that prior_art is technology already available to the public
it is available in legal_theory at least when it is described in the worlds accessible literature including patents or has been publicly known or in.. public use or on sale` in this country'
that is the real meaning of` prior_art' in legal_theory-it is knowledge that is available including what would be obvious from it at a given time to a person of ordinary_skill in the art
kimberly-clark corp. v. johnson & johnson 745_f.2d_1437 1453 223_uspq_603 614 fed.cir.1984 citations omitted

moreover as between an earlier inventor who has not given the public the benefit of the invention e.g. because the invention has been abandoned without public disclosure suppressed or concealed and a subsequent_inventor who obtains a patent the policy of the law is for the subsequent_inventor to prevail
see w.l
gore & assocs. inc. v. garlock inc. 721_f.2d_1540 1550 220_uspq_303 310 fed.cir.1983` early public disclosure is a linchpin of the patent_system
as between a prior inventor [ who does not disclose ] and a later inventor who promptly files a patent_application.. the law favors the latter`
likewise when the possessor of secret art art that has been abandoned suppressed or concealed that predates the critical date is faced with a later-filed patent the later-filed patent should not be invalidated in the face of this` prior' art which has not been made available to the public
thus prior but non-public inventors yield to later inventors who utilize the patent_system

however a change occurred in the law after bass was decided
at the time bass was decided ¡± 103 read as follows a patent may not be obtained though the invention is not identically disclosed or described as set forth in section 102 of this title if the differences between the subject *1403 matter sought to be patented and the prior_art are such that the subject_matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary_skill in the art to which said subject_matter pertains
patentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which the invention was made
35 u.s.c.¡± 103
the prior_art being referred to in that provision arguably included only public prior_art defined in subsections 102 a b e and g

in 1984 congress amended ¡± 103 adding the following paragraph subject_matter developed by another person which qualifies as prior_art only under subsection f or g of section 102 of this title shall not preclude patentability under this section where the subject_matter and the claimed invention were at the time the invention was made owned by the same_person or subject to an obligation of assignment to the same_person
35 u.s.c.¡± 103 now ¡± 103 c emphasis added
it is historically very clear that this provision was intended to avoid the invalidation of patents under ¡± 103 on the basis of the work of fellow employees engaged in team_research
see section-by-section analysis patent law amendments act of 1984 130 cong
rec
28069 28071 oct._1,_1984 reprinted in 1984_u.s.c.c.a.n._5827 5833 stating that the amendment which encourages communication among members of research teams was a response to bass and in re clemens 622_f.2d_1029 206_uspq_289_(ccpa_1980) in which` an earlier invention which is not public may be treated under section 102 g and possibly under 102 f as prior_art'
there was no clearly apparent purpose in congresss inclusion of ¡± 102 f in the amendment other than an attempt to ameliorate the problems of patenting the results of team_research
however the language appears in the statute ; it was enacted by congress
we must give effect to it

the statutory language provides a clear statement that subject_matter that qualifies as prior_art under subsection f or g can not be combined with other_prior_art to render a claimed invention obvious and hence unpatentable when the relevant prior_art is commonly owned with the claimed invention at the time the invention was made
while the statute does not expressly state in so many words that ¡± 102 f creates a type of prior_art for purposes of ¡± 103 nonetheless that conclusion is inescapable ; the language that states that ¡± 102 f subject_matter is not prior_art under limited circumstances clearly implies that it is prior_art otherwise
that is what congress wrote into law in 1984 and that is the way we must read the statute

this result is not illogical
it means that an invention a that is obvious in view of subject_matter a derived from another is also unpatentable
the obvious_invention a may not be unpatentable to the inventor of a and it may not be unpatentable to a third party who did not receive the disclosure of a but it is unpatentable to the party who did receive the disclosure

the ptos regulations also adopt this interpretation of the statute
37 c.f.r.¡± 1.106 d 1996` subject_matter which is developed by another person which qualifies as prior_art only under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 f or g may be used as prior_art under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103`
although the ptos interpretation of this statute is not conclusive we agree with the district_court that it is a reasonable interpretation of the statute

it is sometimes more important that a close question be settled one way or another than which way it is settled
we settle the issue here subject of course to any later intervention by congress or review by the supreme court and do so in a manner that best comports with the voice of congress
thus while there is a basis for an opposite conclusion principally based on the fact that ¡± 102 f does not refer to public activity as do the other provisions that clearly define prior_art nonetheless we can not escape the import of the 1984 amendment
we therefore hold that subject_matter derived from another not only is itself unpatentable to the party who derived it under ¡± 102 f but *1404 when combined with other_prior_art may make a resulting obvious_invention unpatentable to that party under a combination of ¡±¡± 102 f and 103
accordingly the district_court did not err by considering the two design disclosures known to the inventor to be prior_art under the combination of ¡±¡± 102 f and 103

in addition to arguing that the district_court properly considered ¡± 102 f to be a prior_art_provision for purposes of ¡± 103 just_toys argues that the two confidential_disclosures known to the inventor but not disclosed to the pto were` material to patentability' and hence should have been disclosed
just_toys therefore asks this court to remand the case so that the district_court can hear its mooted motion for summary_judgment on the issue of inequitable_conduct
we decline to do so
in light of the ambiguous nature of the statute and the unclear development of the case law regarding the prior_art_status of ¡± 102 f subject_matter until this point we hold as a matter of law that oddzon could not have acted with deceptive intent when it failed to disclose this information to the pto

b. non-obviousness under ¡± 103
just_toys cross-appeals from the district_courts conclusion that just_toys failed to establish obviousness of the design by clear and convincing evidence
just_toys argues that both of the disclosed ¡± 102 f designs constitute primary` references' because they` show all of the basic design elements shown in the001_patent a football with a tailshaft and fins'
this argument is unpersuasive

pursuant to 35 u.s.c.¡± 171 1994 one may obtain a design_patent for` any new original and ornamental_design for an article of manufacture'
the design must also be non-obvious
id
(` the provisions for this title relating to patents for inventions shall apply to patents for designs except as otherwise provided
`` ; in re borden 90_f.3d_1570 1574 39_uspq2d_1524 1526 fed.cir.1996
we agree with the district_court that none of the cited designs including the two confidential_disclosures render the patented_design obvious either individually or in combination
according to familiar law a design_patent only protects the ornamental_aspects of the design
because the presence of a tailshaft and fins has been shown to be necessary to have a ball with similar aerodynamic stability to oddzons commercial_embodiment such general features are functional and thus not protectable as such
invalidating prior_art must show or render obvious the ornamental_features of a patented_design
the existence of prior_art simply showing a ball with a tailshaft and fins without more is not sufficient to render the patented_design obvious
just_toys does not dispute the fact that the fins of the confidential_disclosures lack the ornamental_features of the patented_design
they do not appear to protrude from the ball while gently flaring outwardly
because none of the prior_art cited by just_toys exhibits ornamental characteristics that are the same as or similar to oddzons design we conclude that the district_court did not err in holding that the cited references would not have rendered the patented_design obvious

c. design patent infringement
oddzon argues that the district_court erred in finding a lack of infringement and that it improperly weighed the credibility and probative value of oddzons evidence
oddzon first contends that its evidence established infringement and that a simple comparison of the accused products with the figures in the design_patent is all that is required in an infringement inquiry
in championing the sufficiency of its evidence oddzon argues that` the scope of a design_patent is effectively determined by deciding infringement rather than by construing the claim'
we do not agree

whether a design_patent is infringed is determined by first construing the claim to the design when appropriate and then comparing it to the design of the accused device
elmer v. icc fabricating *1405 inc. 67_f.3d_1571 1577 36_uspq2d_1417 1420 fed.cir.1995
a design_patent only protects the novel ornamental_features of the patented_design
see keystone retaining wall sys. inc. v. westrock inc. 997_f.2d_1444 1450 27_uspq2d_1297 1302 fed.cir.1993 ; lee v. dayton-hudson corp. 838_f.2d_1186 1188 5_uspq2d_1625 1627 fed.cir.1988` [ i ] t is the non-functional design aspects that are pertinent to determinations of infringement'
( footnote omitted
where a design contains both functional and non-functional elements the scope of the claim must be construed in order to identify the non-functional aspects of the design as shown in the patent
lee 838 f.2d at 1188 5 uspq2d at 1627

the comparison step of the infringement analysis requires the fact-finder to determine whether the patented_design as a whole is substantially similar in appearance to the accused design
the patented and accused designs do not have to be identical in order for design_patent_infringement to be found
see braun inc. v. dynamics corp. of am. 975_f.2d_815 820 24_uspq2d_1121 1125 fed.cir.1992
it is the appearance of a design as a whole which is controlling in determining infringement
there can be no infringement based on the similarity of specific_features if the overall appearance of the designs are dissimilar [ i ] f in the eye of an ordinary observer giving such attention as a purchaser usually gives two designs are substantially the same if the resemblance is such as to deceive such an observer inducing him to purchase one supposing it to be the other the first one patented is infringed by the other
gorham co. v. white 81 u.s. 14 wall
511 528 20_l.ed._731_(1871)

in gorham the claimed elements were purely ornamental being limited to the scroll work on the handle portion of flatware
if on the other_hand a design contains both functional and ornamental_features the patentee must show that the perceived similarity is based on the ornamental_features of the design
the patentee` must establish that an ordinary person would be deceived by reason of the common_features in the claimed and accused designs which are ornamental'
read_corp. v. portec inc. 970_f.2d_816 825 23_uspq2d_1426 1434 fed.cir.1992
design patent infringement is a question of fact which a patentee must prove by a preponderance of the evidence
l.a. gear inc. v. thom mcan shoe co. 988_f.2d_1117 1124 25_uspq2d_1913 1918 fed.cir.1993

in construing the claim of oddzons patent the district_court carefully noted the ornamental_features that produced the overall` rocket-like' appearance of the design
we agree with the district_courts claim_construction which properly limits the scope of the patent to its overall ornamental visual impression rather than to the broader general design concept of a rocket-like tossing ball
see durling v. spectrum furniture co. 101_f.3d_100 104 40_uspq2d_1788 1791 fed.cir.1996` a proper interpretation of [ the patentees ] claimed design focuses on the visual impression it creates`
we therefore reject oddzons contention that overall_similarity of the` rocket-like' appearance is sufficient to show infringement

oddzon next argues that the district_court erred by evaluating the persuasiveness of its experts testimony on summary_judgment
contrary to oddzons contention the district_court viewed the experts testimony in the light most favorable to oddzon
however the court held that the experts opinion was wholly conclusory and devoid of any analysis regarding whether the ornamental_features created the overall_similarity
thus the district_court held that the expert_testimony was insufficient to support a jury_verdict in oddzons favor
see read_corp. 970 f.2d at 826 23 uspq2d at 1434 holding that jmol is appropriate where evidence does not establish that similarity was due to ornamental_features

oddzon argues that the expert_testimony was submitted only to show overall_similarity but not the cause of that similarity
however an experts corroboration of overall *1406 similarity was unnecessary
in the context of summary_judgment the survey_evidence sufficiently establishes that consumers believe that the patented_design and the accused balls look similar
the court therefore did not err by affording little probative weight to the experts testimony

oddzon next argues that the survey establishes not only overall_similarity but that the similarity is due to common ornamental_features
specifically oddzon argues that the various features identified by survey respondents including the ends of the fins the football_shape the rocket-like_tail and a ball in front with triangular fins in back are ornamental` because they are not required for a tossing ball'
thus oddzon argues the survey is sufficient to show infringement because it establishes that the common_features are ornamental
we disagree
the survey fails to establish a link between the similarity reported by respondents and the patented ornamental_aspects of the design
many of the respondents indicated that the balls were similar
when asked why they responded by pointing to specific_features some general some more specific some functional some not
however the survey did not ask the respondents whether they believed that there was overall_similarity apart from the fact that both the design and the accused products were essentially footballs with tails and fins

oddzon argues that the shape of a football with an arrow-like_tail is an ornamental feature because` it is not required for a tossing ball'
while oddzon correctly states that there are many ways of designing` tossing_balls' it is undisputed that the ball in question is specifically designed to be thrown like a football yet travel farther than a traditional foam football
it is the football_shape combined with fins on a tail that give the design these functional qualities
the tail and fins on oddzons design add stability in the same manner as do the tail and fins found on darts or rockets
they are no less functional simply because` tossing_balls' can be designed without them
on the other_hand contrary to just_toys arguments in its cross-appeal these functional characteristics do not invalidate the design_patent but merely limit the scope of the protected subject_matter
the district_courts claim_construction which we have approved captures the overall ornamental quality of the design

because the accused products are clearly similar to oddzons design in terms of their football_shape and their tail and fins it was incumbent on oddzon to submit evidence establishing that the ornamental_aspects of their football-with-tail-and-fin combination accounted for the similarity perceived by the survey participants
none of the evidence when viewed in the light most favorable to oddzon would support a jury_verdict that the accused devices are similar to the patented_design with its football-shaped ball slender tailshaft and three fins which seemingly protrude out of the football and gently flare outwardly

oddzon also submitted evidence establishing that just_toys balls were returned to oddzon by retailers on nineteen different occasions
the district_court excluded this evidence of alleged` actual_confusion' on the ground of lack of relevance stating that there was no way to determine whether the mistaken_return of the balls was due to` confusion' or was typical of the industry generally
the district_court also questioned the probative nature of the evidence stating that there was no way to determine if any` confusion' was caused by ornamental or non-ornamental_features

oddzon argues that the exclusion was improper because just_toys never questioned whether the number of returns was` normal' or out of the ordinary
had just_toys raised the issue oddzon contends that it would have responded and demonstrated its relevance
oddzon now responds that the` actual_confusion' evidence like the experts evidence was not submitted to show that the confusion was caused by ornamental_features but rather to show that the overall designs are similar

we agree with oddzon that the exclusion of the` actual_confusion' evidence on relevance *1407 grounds was an abuse of discretion
given the low threshold for relevancy it is clear that the evidence was relevant
it has a` tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence'
fed.r.evid
401
we find this error harmless however because it does not change the result of oddzons appeal
see fed.r.civ.p
61
sufficient evidence of record establishes that the accused balls and oddzons patented_design are similar
a simple inspection confirms this fact
but as the district_court held the` actual_confusion' evidence is of little probative value because it does not establish whether the balls were returned to oddzon simply because they had a tail and fins or because they have an ornamental_design similar to that of the patented_design

oddzon further argues that the district_court erroneously confused the trade_dress_survey with the design_patent_survey
although this appears to have been true this error is also harmless
both surveys suffer from the same infirmity
they fail to distinguish between the ornamental_features of the balls and their functional aspects such that a reasonable_jury could determine that the perceived similarity was due to the protected ornamental_features
accordingly we conclude that the district_court did not err in holding that just_toys was entitled as a matter of law to a judgment of non-infringement of oddzons design_patent

d. trade dress
oddzon argues that the district_court erred in its summary_judgment that just_toys did not unlawfully copy its trade_dress
just_toys had moved for summary_judgment on the trade_dress claim asserting that oddzons ball design was functional and therefore unprotected
the district_court granted just_toys motion but on the ground that oddzon failed to establish a likelihood of confusion
oddzon contends that the grant of summary_judgment is in error because oddzon was not granted an opportunity to address the dispositive issue likelihood of confusion
citing celotex corp. v. catrett 477_u.s._317 326 106_s.ct._2548 2554 91_l.ed.2d_265_(1986) oddzon argues that the district_court erred by granting the motion for summary_judgment on a ground other than that raised by the movant effectively entering summary_judgment_sua_sponte without giving oddzon an opportunity to respond

we disagree
the district_court did not enter summary_judgment_sua_sponte
in its summary_judgment motion just_toys asserted that its products did not infringe oddzons design_patent or any protectable_trade_dress and specifically asserted that any similarities that the vortex_ball shares with the ultra pass ball are functional
oddzon responded to just_toys motion by submitting its design_patent_survey samples of alternate ball designs and its trade_dress likelihood of confusion survey
oddzon has not suggested that it possessed other trade_dress_surveys regarding likelihood of confusion that it failed to submit to the court
we therefore find oddzons argument that it lacked an opportunity to respond with sufficient_evidence to raise a genuine_issue regarding likelihood of confusion to be without merit
see celotex 477 u.s. at 322 106 s.ct.at 2552 stating that summary_judgment is appropriate` after adequate time for discovery and upon motion against the party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that partys case and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial'

oddzon also argues that the district_court improperly discounted the evidence of record including its trade_dress consumer survey
oddzon asserted a claim of trade_dress_infringement under section 43 a of the lanham_act 15 u.s.c.¡± 1125 a 1994
because trade_dress issues are not unique to the exclusive jurisdiction of this court we defer to the law of the regional circuit in which a district_court sits
see keystone retaining wall sys. inc. 997 f.2d at 1447-48 27 uspq2d at 1300
in the *1408 ninth_circuit for a plaintiff to prevail in an action for trade_dress_infringement under the lanham_act the plaintiff must show that the asserted trade_dress 1 is not functional 2 is inherently distinctive or has acquired distinctiveness through a secondary_meaning and 3 is likely to cause confusion with the defendants products
see fuddruckers inc. v. docs b.r
others inc. 826_f.2d_837 841-42 4_uspq2d_1026 1029-30 9th cir.1987 requiring a showing of secondary_meaning ; two pesos inc. v. taco cabana inc. 505_u.s._763 776 112_s.ct._2753 2761 120_l.ed.2d_615 23_uspq2d_1081 1086 1992 holding that secondary_meaning is not required where inherent_distinctiveness is shown

following the ninth_circuits eight factor test for likelihood of confusion articulated in amf inc. v. sleekcraft boats 599_f.2d_341 348-49 204_uspq_808 814 9th cir.1979 the district_court thoroughly examined the evidence presented and concluded that oddzon had failed to meet its burden of establishing a likelihood of confusion
the court based its decision on the fact that the defendants balls are clearly and prominently labeled the crowded toy market leads to a conclusion that consumers have experience selecting between two marks with care and the time consumers will spend comparing the balls makes it unlikely that consumers would not be able to discriminate between the two

in addition the district_court properly discounted the trade_dress_survey_evidence to the extent that consumers believed the accused balls and oddzons balls could be associated with each other simply because they both had tails and fins
the mistaken association of two footballs with tails and fins in a line-up composed of three additional balls that lacked these essential features is not probative of trade_dress_infringement
we are unpersuaded by oddzons remaining critique of the district_courts analysis
viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to oddzon we hold that the district_court did not err in concluding that oddzon has failed to establish that a likelihood of confusion exists between just_toys balls and oddzons balls
we have also considered oddzons arguments regarding infringement of its right to protect the trade_dress of its packaging and find them equally unpersuasive
as the district_court noted although there are some similarities between the packaging e.g. they are both rectangular in shape and have the balls mounted on an upward sloping surface there are also many differences
oddzons packaging carries a prominent sports stars picture and endorsement while just_toys packaging does not
furthermore different color schemes are used
most significantly oddzon relies on its trade_dress_survey as establishing a likelihood of confusion regarding the packaging
as previously stated this survey is insufficient to demonstrate that consumer_confusion was related to any protectable aspect of oddzons trade_dress
we therefore hold that the district_court did not err in concluding that oddzon has failed to establish that a likelihood of confusion exists between just_toys packaging and oddzons packaging

e. the remaining claims
oddzon argues that the district_courts summary_judgment that there was no unfair_competition under state law must be reversed because it failed to address oddzons evidence of design_patent_infringement and trade_dress_infringement
this argument is without merit
this claim is premised on the same facts and arguments as those proffered to support oddzons federal claims
having decided that just_toys design was sufficiently dissimilar to oddzons design to avoid both design_patent and trade_dress_infringement the district_court did not err by summarily granting just_toys motion on this claim
because we affirm the district_courts rulings on the federal law claims we likewise affirm its ruling that the evidence equally fails to support the unfair_competition claim
we have considered oddzons remaining arguments and find them to be without merit

finally in its cross-appeal just_toys argues that the district_court erroneously affirmed the magistrate_judges order compelling *1409 production of privileged_documents related to just_toys defense to the charge of willful infringement
because we affirm the district_courts holding of non-infringement this issue is moot and accordingly the magistrate_judges june_6,_1996 order granting plaintiffs expedited motion to compel is vacated

conclusion
the district_court did not err in granting just_toys motion for summary_judgment on oddzons design_patent claim and on its trade_dress and state-law_unfair_competition claims
furthermore the district_court did not err in granting oddzons motion for summary_judgment that just_toys failed to establish invalidity of the001_patent
in addition the district_courts order compelling production of privileged_documents is vacated as moot
accordingly the district_courts judgment is affirmed

affirmed
