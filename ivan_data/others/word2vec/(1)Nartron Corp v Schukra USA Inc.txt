nartron corporation` nartron' appeals from the judgment of the united_states_district_court for the eastern_district of michigan granting summary_judgment of dismissal of its patent infringement complaint because of nartrons failure to join an alleged co-inventor on u.s. patent 6,049,748` the ¡¬748_patent` as a plaintiff

because joseph benson the alleged co-inventor provided only an insignificant contribution to the invention of claim 11 of the ¡¬748_patent by contributing an` extender' we reverse the grant of summary_judgment to borg_indak incorporated` borg_indak' and remand to the district_court for further_action consistent with this opinion

background
schukra u.s.a. incorporated` schukra' supplies automobile manufacturers *1354 with lumbar_support systems for automobile_seats
in 1996 schukra contracted with nartron for nartron to design a control_system that would provide existing automobile_seats with massage_functionality
nartron designed such a system and then applied for a patent relating to a vehicle seat_control_system that provides massage capability ; that patent application matured into the ¡¬748_patent

borg_indak supplies electronic components to schukra
in 2006 nartron sued borg_indak for contributory infringement of claims 1_and_7 of the ¡¬748_patent
borg_indak moved for summary_judgment of dismissal alleging that benson a schukra employee was a co-inventor of claim 11 of the ¡¬748_patent and therefore needed to have been joined in the suit
neither schukra nor benson had consented to or had joined the suit

claim 11 for which benson is alleged to be a co-inventor is a dependent_claim
it depends from claim 6 which in turn depends from claim 5 which itself depends from claim 1
claims 1 5 6 and 11 read as follows 1
a seat_control_module for introducing massage to a seat_control with an adjustable_lumbar_support and control_actuators the control_module comprising a modular housing including in-line connectors for coupling said module to a seat_control harness connector ; an intercept interface for receiving inputs from said control_actuators ; a driver for repeatedly adjusting said lumbar_support_position through a predetermined range of movement in response to one of said control_actuators ; and
a transparency_simulator for maintaining full function of said seat_control and removing indications of repeatedly adjusting said lumbar_support_position
... 5
the invention as defined in claim 1 wherein said transparency_simulator comprises time-based response to manipulation of said control_actuators
6
the invention as defined in claim 5 wherein said transparency_simulator generates a first output in response to a manipulation of a said control_actuator for a period of time less than a first predetermined period and generating a second output in response to a manipulation of said control_actuator for a period equal to or greater than said first predetermined time period
... 11
the invention as defined in claim 6 wherein said lumbar_support_adjustor includes an extender
¡¬748_patent col. 19 l.13-col.20 l.31
thus the key additional limitation in claim 11 which benson is alleged to have contributed is an extender for a lumbar_support_adjustor

the specification provides only the following description of the extender` a second_motor 28 controls a lumbar_support_extender 30 and it governs the degree to which the lumbar_support extends outwardly from the seat back toward a spinal_curvature of an occupant
both mechanisms 26_and_30 affect the position of the lumbar_support 32 of the seat_mechanism 16'
id.at col.4 ll.28-33
the figures simply represent the extender 30 as a box in the circuit_diagram of the control_system
id.at figs
1 & 2 numeral 30

the inventors listed on the ¡¬748_patent all nartron employees presumptively invented *1355 the control_system
however they admit that they did not invent the lumbar_support_adjustor including an extender recited in claim 11 as nartrons inventive contribution consisted of a control_module that operated on existing automobile_seats some of which already included extenders for lumbar_support_adjustors
benson claims to have provided nartron with the idea for the extender for a lumbar_support_adjustor although he admits that the idea of an extender for a lumbar_support_adjustor in an automobile_seat was in the prior_art
oral argument at 11:38-12:30 available at http //oral arguments.cafc.uscourts.gov/mp3/2008-1363.mp3` if you isolate the specific arm that extends out that was in the prior_art with respect to other lumbar_supports
``

in march 2008 the district_court granted borg_indaks motion for summary_judgment of dismissal
the court held that benson was a co-inventor of the ¡¬ 748 patent because according to the court he had conceived of the extender element of claim 11 and as a co-inventor he was required to have been joined as a plaintiff in any infringement suit
the court reasoned that contrary to nartrons arguments the ¡¬748_patent was not based exclusively on the control_module and its software and that the contribution of the mechanical extender to the claimed invention was not insignificant in quality because benson had conceived of the massager unit and had developed a prototype
the court also found that there was no genuine_issue of material_fact regarding who had invented the extender because the named inventors had conceded that they did not invent the extender and benson had provided evidence that he had been working on a lumbar_support frame or basket which operated as an extender that provided a massage effect
the court also relied on nartrons failure to provide any evidence to contradict bensons evidence that he had conceived and reduced to practice an extender for a lumbar_support_adjustor
the court thus dismissed the case for failure to join a necessary plaintiff in the lawsuit
bensons employer schukra maintained a contractual relationship with the defendant borg_indak
thus grant of the motion to dismiss effectively prevented nartron from enjoining or obtaining damages from borg_indak for patent infringement

nartron timely appealed the district_courts dismissal
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

discussion
we review summary_judgment determinations de novo
netscape commc'ns corp. v. konrad 295_f.3d_1315 1319 fed.cir.2002
`` summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine_issue as to any material_fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law'

( quotation_marks omitted

nartron argues that the district_court erred in granting summary_judgment of coinventorship
according to nartron the extender for a lumbar_support_adjustor recited in claim 11 was in the prior_art and therefore could not have supported a claim of coinventorship
nartron also argues that the preamble of claim 1 includes` an adjustable_lumbar_support' making it clear that the lumbar_support_adjustor was part of the background of the invention and already existed
instead according to nartron the inventive aspect of the claimed invention is the controller and benson did not conceive of the controller
nartron argues that the specification states that the improvement is in the controller *1356 not the hardware of the automobile_seat and that the controller can be adapted to work with any automobile_seat
nartron also asserts that the drawings do not show any structure for the extender
moreover according to nartron irrespective of whether the extender for the lumbar_support_adjustor was in the prior_art bensons alleged contribution is insignificant to the invention of the ¡¬748_patent
according to nartron one who merely poses a problem or suggests a possible result rather than a means of accomplishing it is not a joint_inventor
in addition nartron asserts that the court erred by focusing solely on whether benson conceived of an element of claim 11 without looking at the entire invention of claim 11 because inventorship focuses on the invention as a whole
nartron also argues that the fact that the extender only appears in a dependent_claim shows that the controller is patentable without the extender further demonstrating the insignificance of bensons contribution

borg_indak responds that even though the lumbar_support_adjustor and extender were in the prior_art the named inventors admitted that they did not invent them but had been provided those aspects of the claimed invention by the customer schukra
borg_indak adds that combinations of existing elements are patentable so nartron can not eliminate the lumbar_support aspect of claim 11 from the invention simply because it existed in the prior_art
borg_indak also argues that benson and other schukra employees contributed to aspects of other_claims in addition to claim 11 as schukra provided nartron with instructions to build a control_module for an automobile_seat that would provide particular functionality
borg_indak also responds that bensons contribution was not insignificant as even the subject_matter of dependent_claims must be invented by named inventors
thus according to borg_indak an aspect of a claim can not be insignificant simply because it appears in a dependent_claim

inventorship is a question of law which we review without deference
ethicon inc. v. u.s._surgical_corp. 135_f.3d_1456 1460 fed.cir.1998
`` the inventors as named in an issued patent are presumed to be correct'
hess v. advanced cardiovascular sys. inc. 106_f.3d_976 980 fed.cir.1997 quotation_marks omitted
thus a party alleging non-joinder` must meet the heavy burden of proving its case by clear and convincing evidence'
eli_lilly & co. v. aradigm corp. 376_f.3d_1352 1358 fed.cir.2004

we agree with nartron that there is no genuine_issue of material_fact in this case and that benson was not as a result of suggesting an extender a co-inventor of claim 11 of the ¡¬748_patent as a matter of law
any contribution benson made to the invention described in claim 11 by contributing an extender was insignificant and therefore prevents benson from attaining the status of a co-inventor
`` one who simply provides the inventor with well-known principles or explains the state of the art without ever having a firm and definite idea of the claimed combination as a whole does not qualify as a joint_inventor'
ethicon 135 f.3d at 1460 quotation_marks omitted ; see caterpillar inc. v. sturman indus. inc. 387_f.3d_1358 1377 fed.cir.2004` [ a ] person will not be a co-inventor if he or she does no more than explain to the real_inventors_concepts that are well known in the current_state of the art'
( quotation_marks omitted
moreover a joint_inventor must` contribute in some significant manner to the conception *1357 or reduction to practice of the invention [ and ] make a contribution to the claimed invention that is not insignificant in quality when that contribution is measured against the dimension of the full invention'
pannu v. iolab corp. 155_f.3d_1344 1351 fed.cir.1998 ; see caterpillar 387 f.3d at 1377 quoting fina_oil & chem co. v. ewen 123_f.3d_1466 1473 fed.cir.1997

here borg_indak asserts that benson contributed the extender for a lumbar_support_adjustor
however the contribution of the extender is insignificant when measured against the full_dimension of the invention of claim 11 not just because it was in the prior_art but because it was part of existing automobile_seats and therefore including it as part of the claimed invention was merely the basic_exercise of ordinary_skill in the art
see fina_oil 123 f.3d at 1473` the basic_exercise of the normal skill expected of one skilled in the art without an inventive act also does not make one a joint_inventor
therefore a person will not be a co-inventor if he or she does no more than explain to the real_inventors_concepts that are well known and the current_state of the art'
( citations omitted ; see also eli_lilly 376 f.3d at 1362` a contribution of information in the prior_art can not give rise to joint_inventorship because it is not a contribution to conception
``

borg_indak admitted at oral argument that a lumbar_support_adjustor with an extender existed in automobile_seats in the prior_art
thus bensons contribution of supplying the extender to the patented_invention was the exercise of ordinary_skill in the art
the specification of the ¡¬748_patent makes clear that the automobile_seat including its lumbar_support_adjustor and extender comprises the existing object on which the invention i.e. the control_module operates or the background to the invention
for example the specification states that the` invention can.. be implemented with a wide variety of seat systems regardless of the particular vendor or [ model ] to provide a massage function without interfering with [ existing features and mechanisms in the seats ]'
¡¬748_patent col.4 ll.19-24 ; see also id.at abstract` [ the control_modules improved functions and features ] do not require alternative wiring harness changes and do not affect existing operations of a memory or non-memory seat_control mechanism
`` ; id.at col.2 ll.28-31` [ a ] module interfaces and integrates with existing and future automotive seat_control hardware and software as pertinent to provide complementary functions especially including the new automatic seat lumbar massage feature`
as borg_indak admitted the extender was an existing feature in an automobile_seat
in fact the necessity for the invention described in the ¡¬748_patent arose from the fact that existing automobile_seats had the parts required to provide a massage e.g. lumbar_support_adjustors including extenders but simply lacked the controller that would move those parts in a way that would provide a massage
see id.at col.4 ll.43-46` any automotive seat adjustment system for which a lumbar_support_position sensor is engineered and available as a standard or as an optional offering is a candidate for integration of a massage control_module 34`
thus bensons suggestion that the control_module be capable of operating with an automobile_seat that has a lumbar_support_adjustor including an extender only amounted to the exercise of ordinary_skill in the art

further supporting the conclusion that bensons contribution of the extender was insignificant when measured against the *1358 full_dimension of the invention of claim 11 the specification and claims of the ¡¬748_patent primarily focus not on the structure of the seat itself but on the structure and function of the control_module which operates the seat
the specification mentions the extender only once in a twenty-column patent
the only time that the specification mentions the extender it does no more than refer to it as the background upon which the invention is built
the specification describes how the extender is controlled by a motor and the figures simply represent the extender 30 as a box in the circuit_diagram of the control_system showing where it fits into the overall operation of the control_module
see id.at col.4 ll.28-33` a second_motor 28 controls a lumbar_support_extender 30 and it governs the degree to which the lumbar_support extends outwardly from the seat back toward a spinal_curvature of an occupant
both mechanisms 26_and_30 affect the position of the lumbar_support 32 of the seat_mechanism 16
`` ; id.at figs
1 & 2 numeral 30
the patent contains no description of the physical characteristics of the extender nor does it contain any drawing of the extender

in hess we held that hess was not a co-inventor when he had explained the state of the art to the inventors and had suggested that the inventors use a particular material in their product
106 f.3d at 980-81
in this case as in hess bensons contribution of the extender amounted to` nothing more than explaining to the inventors what the then state of the art was and supplying a product to them for use in their invention'
id.at 981
also like the situation in hess the` extensive research and development work that produced' the claimed control_module was done by nartrons employees
id
although benson claims to have researched and developed a particular extender borg_indak admits that the basic concept of an extender which is all that is disclosed in the ¡¬748_patent concerning the extender was in the prior_art
similarly to hess therefore benson can not be considered a co-inventor of claim 11
see id
thus in a factually similar case we have held a putative inventors contribution not to rise to the level of co-inventorship
this is not a case in which a person claims to be an inventor because he has suggested a non-obvious combination of prior_art elements to the named inventors
such an individual may be a co-inventor
there is not and could not be any claim that the addition of the extender here was anything but obvious
bensons contribution therefore does not make him a co-inventor of the subject_matter of claim 11

one further point should be made
borg_indak asserts that benson was the inventor of the sole_feature added by claim 11
however a dependent_claim adding one claim limitation to a parent_claim is still a claim to the invention of the parent_claim albeit with the added feature ; it is not a claim to the added feature alone
even if benson did suggest the addition of the prior_art extender to what nartron had invented the invention of claim 11 was not the extender but included all of the features of claims 1 5 and 6 from which it depends
it has not yet been determined whether benson contributed to the invention of claim 1 although he does not claim to be a co-inventor with respect to claims 5_and_6
if benson did not make those inventions he does not necessarily attain the status of co-inventor by providing the sole_feature of a dependent_claim
see id
( holding that hess was not a co-inventor even though he supplied` heat-shrinkable plastic' which was the only additional limitation *1359 recited in dependent_claim 12 of the patent in suit

borg_indak also asserts that benson was a co-inventor of the ¡¬ 748 patent because he realized that a control_module with certain specifications would be useful and he gave nartron a description detailing the ultimate functions of the control_module
nartron according to borg_indak simply carried out the invention by building that control_module
however` [ o ] ne who merely suggests an idea of a result to be accomplished rather than means of accomplishing it is not a joint_inventor'
garrett corp. v. united states 190_ct.cl._858 422_f.2d_874 881 1970 ; see also eli_lilly 376 f.3d at 1359 stating that one who is` too far removed from the real-world realization of an invention' is not a co-inventor ; ethicon inc. v. u.s._surgical_corp. 937_f.supp._1015 1035 d.conn.1996` an entrepreneurs request to another to create a product that will fulfill a certain function is not conception-even if the entrepreneur supplies continuous input on the acceptability of offered products'
( quotation_marks omitted affd 135_f.3d_1456 fed.cir.1998
thus benson is not entitled to co-inventorship by simply posing the result to nartron and leaving it to nartron to figure out how to accomplish it

we have considered borg_indaks remaining arguments and find them unpersuasive

conclusion
accordingly the judgment of the district_court is reversed* and the case is remanded to the district_court for further_action consistent with this opinion

reversed
