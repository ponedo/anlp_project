background
typeright is the owner of the ¡¬441 and ¡¬484_patent s which generally describe ergonomic_keyboards featuring v-shaped designs with separate_right-and left-hand_key_clusters ; keys arranged in a qwerty_configuration ; 1 and a wrist_rest
the ¡¬441 and ¡¬484_patent s are both continuations of united states application no._990021 filed december 14 1992 which is itself a continuation-in-part of an earlier application filed on february 21 1991
the parties appear to assume that the ¡¬441 and ¡¬484_patent s claim priority to february 21 1991 and that february 21 1990 is the critical_date for the patents in suit

on july_23,_1998 typeright filed a complaint against microsoft alleging that microsofts line of ergonomic_keyboards infringed several of typerights patents including the ¡¬441 and ¡¬484_patent s. microsoft responded by asserting affirmative defenses and counterclaims for non-infringement invalidity and unenforceability
following the district_courts markman order construing the claims typeright amended its complaint to assert infringement of only claims 11_and_12 of the ¡¬441_patent and claims 1-11 of the ¡¬484_patent

on august 31 1999 microsoft filed motions for summary_judgment of non-infringement and invalidity
in regard to invalidity microsoft argued that all of the asserted claims were obvious in light of the prior_art relying primarily on a one-page document` the marquardt_document' created by the german company marquardt gmbh` marquardt'
microsoft additionally relied on a prior_art keyboard and a book keyboard rsi the practical solution by barbara stack the` stack_reference' which taught that v-shaped keyboards` are.. ergonomically acceptable provided they are used.. in conjunction with a properly designed attached wrist_support' to show that the asserted claims were obvious
( j.a.at 3553

the marquardt_document features several unlabeled pictures of v-shaped keyboards with separate_right and left-hand_key_clusters in the german equivalent of a qwerty_configuration
it is a single page in length and is not dated
typeright *1155 claims to have first learned of the documents existence during depositions conducted by microsoft in germany

because the marquardt_document was undated microsoft sought to prove that it was prior_art under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b i.e. that it was publicly accessible prior to february 21 1990
for this purpose microsoft offered fact testimony of several consultants who were paid for the time they spent testifying
the first was dr._cakir who testified that he found the marquardt_document in his` files from the year 1990' but remembered receiving the document at a trade_show in germany he attended in 1986
( j.a.at 700
another of microsofts consultants dr._hirsch testified that he attended the same 1986 trade_show and remembered that photographs similar to the marquardt_document were being distributed to the attendees
additionally microsoft relied on a 1986 report prepared by the fraunhofer institute for industrial science and organization` the fraunhofer_report' for marquardt
although microsoft did not introduce a translated copy of the fraunhofer_report it argued that the pictures contained therein displaying v-shaped keyboards similar to those shown in the marquardt_document corroborated mr. cakirs testimony
dr. ilg who prepared the fraunhofer_report testified that the report featured pictures of wooden prototypes of the marquardt keyboards and that these prototypes were displayed at the 1986 trade_show where dr._cakir allegedly acquired a publicly distributed copy of the marquardt_document
none of microsofts experts was a current or former employee of marquardt and no evidence obtained from marquardt itself was offered to prove a publication date for the marquardt_document

typeright responded to microsofts motion for summary_judgment arguing inter alia 1 that the testimony of dr._cakir as to the date of the marquardt_document was not sufficiently corroborated by the testimony of microsofts other witnesses and the fraunhofer_report ; 2 that the testimony of microsofts witnesses as to the date of the document was not credible ; and 3 that there was no suggestion to combine the alleged prior_art.2 the district_court rejected these arguments and orally granted microsofts motion for summary_judgment of invalidity on june_19,_2000
the court declined to rule on microsofts motion for summary_judgment of non-infringement and denied the motion for summary_judgment of inequitable_conduct

final judgment was entered june_22,_2000
on july_6,_2000 microsoft filed an application pursuant to federal_rule of civil_procedure 60 b 1 seeking to vacate the entry of final_judgment because as it argued its counterclaims for non-infringement and inequitable_conduct remained pending
on july_25,_2000 the district_court granted microsofts rule 60 b application and vacated the final_judgment.3 subsequently microsoft filed a renewed motion for summary_judgment of non-infringement that the court denied on march_28,_2002

mar._28,_2002
on november *1156 19 2001 typeright filed a motion for reconsideration of the summary_judgment of invalidity arguing amongst other things that the district_court failed to make sufficient findings to show obviousness under the graham factors
the district_court granted this motion in part` for the limited purpose of making.. supplemental graham findings' related to a motivation to combine and affirmed the earlier grant of summary_judgment of invalidity

july_2,_2002
on november 19 2002 the court certified the decision on invalidity pursuant to federal_rule of civil_procedure 54 b and dismissed without prejudice microsofts counterclaims for inequitable_conduct and non-infringement
typeright_keyboard_corp. v. microsoft_corp. no._98- 1358-ieg s.d.cal
nov._19,_2002

typeright timely appealed the judgment of invalidity and microsoft_cross-appealed from the district_courts dismissal of its counterclaim for non-infringement
the inequitable_conduct issue has not been raised on appeal and the only ground for invalidity before this court is obviousness
prior to argument typeright moved to dismiss the cross-appeal for lack of jurisdiction
this motion was denied by order on april_30,_2003

discussion
i
we are obligated first to consider the question of jurisdiction
our jurisdiction over the main_appeal is clear under 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1 but we conclude that we lack jurisdiction over microsofts cross-appeal

a party that is not adversely affected by a judgment lacks standing to appeal

chaides constr co. 960_f.2d_1020 1038-39 fed.cir.1992 en banc
where the appellant lacks standing we lack jurisdiction to decide the appeal

comm n 306 u.s. at 207 59_s.ct._480 ; see also diamond v. charles 476_u.s._54 71 106_s.ct._1697 90_l.ed.2d_48_(1986)
the same rules necessarily apply to cross-appeals

in its cross-appeal here microsoft argues that the accused keyboards do not infringe because they are within the scope of subject_matter disclaimed during prosecution of typerights patents
but since the district_court held that all of the asserted claims are invalid this cross-appeal for a declaration of non-infringement is improper
a party may` cross-appeal if adversely affected by the appealed judgment in some particular which it seeks to have modified'
beloit corp. v. valmet oy 742_f.2d_1421 1424 fed.cir.1984 ; see also jamesbury 839 f.2d at 1550 holding that because the defendant was not adversely affected the denial of a directed verdict of laches could not have been cross-appealed in a previous challenge to the district_courts judgment of invalidity
as our decision in bailey v. dart container corp. of michigan 292_f.3d_1360_(fed.cir.2002) makes clear` [ i ] t is only necessary and appropriate to file a cross-appeal when a party seeks to enlarge its own rights under the judgment or to lessen the rights of its adversary under the *1157 judgment'
id.at 1362
thus a cross-appeal is proper only when acceptance of the argument advanced` would result in a reversal or modification of the judgment rather than an affirmance'
id
where as here the district_court has entered a judgment of invalidity as to all of the asserted claims there is no basis for a cross-appeal as to either 1 additional claims for invalidity or 2 claims of non-infringement
as we held in weatherchem corp. v. j.l
clark inc. 163_f.3d_1326_(fed.cir.1998) a judgment` that claims are invalid eliminates as a practical matter the need to consider on appeal whether those claims are infringed even if the accused infringer has filed a counterclaim for a declaratory judgment of noninfringement'
id.at 1335
therefore although a judgment of non-infringement does not necessarily moot validity issues on appeal cardinal chem co. v. morton intl. inc. 508_u.s._83 98 113_s.ct._1967 124_l.ed.2d_1_(1993) a judgment of invalidity necessarily moots the issue of infringement see e.g. sandt tech. ltd. v. resco metal plastics corp. 264_f.3d_1344 1356 fed.cir.2001 ; weatherchem 163 f.3d at 1335
this is because` a determination of infringement applies only to a specific accused product or process' whereas` invalidity operates as a complete defense to infringement for any product forever'
weatherchem 163 f.3d at 1335-36

because microsofts rights under the judgment of invalidity are actually broader than its rights would be under a judgment of non-infringement microsoft has not been adversely affected by the district_courts judgment.4 because there is no jurisdiction for the cross-appeal we dismiss the cross-appeal ; order that the surreply brief be stricken ; and treat microsofts arguments in support of its cross-appeal as an alternate ground for affirming the district_courts judgment.5

ii
we turn now to the merits of the main_appeal
we review the district_courts grant of summary_judgment without deference
scanner techs corp. v. icos vision sys corp. n.v. 365_f.3d_1299 1302 fed.cir.2004
the party seeking to invalidate the patent must do so by clear and convincing evidence
norian corp. v. stryker corp. 363_f.3d_1321 1326 fed.cir.2004
whether a reference was published prior to the critical_date and is therefore prior_art is a question of law based on underlying fact questions
n. telecom inc. v. datapoint corp. 908_f.2d_931 936 fed.cir.1990
while this is a close case we conclude that summary_judgment of invalidity was improperly granted and that a trial is necessary to determine whether the testimony offered by microsoft to prove that the marquardt_document was prior_art is credible

the district_court granted summary_judgment of obviousness relying on the testimony of microsofts_witnesses to establish that the marquardt_document was distributed at a german trade_show in *1158 1986 and thus was prior_art
we agree that such a distribution would constitute a publication under 35_u.s.c._102 b
see mass
inst
of tech
v. ab fortia 774_f.2d_1104 1109 fed.cir.1985 holding that a paper that was orally presented and distributed without restriction to six people constituted a` printed publication' under section 102 b
but we conclude that summary_judgment was improper because genuine_issues remain as to the credibility of microsofts_witnesses testimony that the marquardt_document was publicly distributed in 1986

typeright points to a number of facts that raise doubts as to the credibility of the proffered evidence
first the marquardt_document itself is undated and was discovered in a file dated 1990 rather than 1986
second the testimony of drs
cakir and hirsch relates to events that allegedly occurred over 18 years ago
the long lapse of time suggests possible faulty recollection
third the testimony itself is somewhat tentative
dr._hirsch testified only that he remembered seeing photographs` similar' to the marquardt_document being distributed at the 1986 trade_show
( j.a.at 715-16
when asked if the marquardt_document was handed out at the 1986 trade_show dr._cakir responded` i think so yes'
( j.a.at 702
) 6 dr._cakir also testified that` [ t ] he actual photograph is in my files and these are files from the year 1990 and the date is-when it comes into our files it is the latest date when we have received the document'
( j.a.at 700 emphasis added
no explanation was offered for the discrepancy in the file date
fourth dr._cakir testified it would be possible to` find out exactly the date when th [ e ] document was issued' using` the marquardt number' printed on the document j.a.at 1368 but there is no evidence that he contacted marquardt to determine whether his recollection was correct
fifth the fact that marquardt filed two patent applications in 1991 for similar keyboards which arguably would not have been proper if the marquardt_document was publicly distributed in 1986 tends to support typerights theory that the marquardt_document was not created until several years after the 1986 trade_show.7 finally drs
cakir and hirsch who testified as fact witnesses not as experts both received compensation from microsoft for their time spent testifying and dr._cakir had previously served as a paid consultant to microsoft

under such circumstances summary_judgment should not have been granted particularly in view of the clear and convincing evidence standard required for invalidity
summary judgment should not be denied simply because the opposing party asserts that the movants_witnesses are not to be believed
however summary_judgment is not appropriate where the opposing party offers specific_facts that call into question the credibility of the movants_witnesses
see sartor v. ark
natural gas corp. 321_u.s._620 628-29 64_s.ct._724 88_l.ed._967_(1944) reversing summary_judgment where the only *1159 evidence in support of the movants contention was the testimony of its experts and there were specific_bases for doubting the credibility of that testimony ; 10a charles alan wright arthur r. miller & mary kay kane federal practice procedure 2726 at 446 3d ed
1998` [ i ] f the credibility of the movants witnesses is challenged by the opposing party and specific_bases for possible impeachment are shown summary_judgment should be denied and the case allowed to proceed to trial..' ; see also lodge hall music inc. v. waco wrangler club inc. 831_f.2d_77 81 5th cir.1987` while the mere claim that an affidavit is perjured is insufficient where specific_facts are alleged that if proven would call the credibility of the moving partys witness into doubt summary_judgment is improper
`` ; in re citizens loan sav co. 621_f.2d_911 913 8th cir.1980 acknowledging that specific_facts tending to discredit a key witness could create a genuine_issue for trial

here typeright pointed to specific_facts that tend to discredit the testimony of drs
cakir and hirsch
these facts create a genuine_issue as to the credibility of microsofts_witnesses
thus while the evidence is sufficient to support a jury finding that the marquardt_document is prior_art a reasonable jury could ultimately conclude otherwise
in such circumstances` [ t ] he court may not assess the credibility of testimony when granting summary_judgment'
loral fairchild corp. v. matsushita elec
indus co. 266_f.3d_1358 1363 fed.cir.2001 ; see also fed.r.civ.p
56 advisory committees note 1963 amendment` where an issue as to a material_fact can not be resolved without observation of the demeanor of witnesses in order to evaluate their credibility summary_judgment is not appropriate
``8

typeright is entitled to a trial to determine if the marquardt_document is prior_art
if the jury finds the testimony of microsofts_witnesses credible and sufficient to establish that the marquardt_document was published prior to the critical_date the district_court will still have to address whether the legal requirement of corroboration has been met
`` [ c ] orroboration is required of any witness whose testimony alone is asserted to invalidate a patent'
texas digital sys. inc. v. telegenix inc. 308_f.3d_1193 1217 fed.cir.2002 quoting finnigan corp. v. intl
trade commn. 180_f.3d_1354 1369 fed.cir.1999 alteration in original
both physical evidence and oral testimony of a disinterested party can serve to satisfy the corroboration requirement
sandt 264 f.3d at 1351
the sufficiency of the corroborating evidence is assessed according to the following factors 1 the relationship between the corroborating witness and the alleged prior_user 2 the time period between the event and trial 3 the interest of the corroborating witness in the subject_matter in suit 4 contradiction or impeachment of the witness testimony 5 the extent and details of the corroborating testimony *1160 6 the witness familiarity with the subject_matter of the patented invention and the prior_use 7 probability that a prior_use could occur considering the state of the art at the time 8 impact of the invention on the industry and the commercial value of its practice
woodland trust v. flowertree nursery inc. 148_f.3d_1368 1371 fed.cir.1998

typeright also argues that the original_marquardt_document is` insufficient to invalidate the patents' because the pictures are too small to discern necessary details and that the district_court erred by relying on an enlarged_version of that document
( appellants opening br.at 24
we decline to address this issue in the first instance on appeal
on remand the district_court should consider the scope and content of the original_marquardt_document as well as the propriety of relying on the enlarged_version
if these issues are resolved in microsofts favor and the marquardt_document is found to be prior_art we agree that the district_court could conclude that the ¡¬441 and ¡¬484_patent s were obvious in light of the prior_art.9

iii
in the alternative microsoft urges that we sustain the judgment on other_grounds namely that the asserted claims can not be construed to cover its keyboards because of disclaimers made in the prosecution of typerights patents
even though we lack jurisdiction over the cross-appeal microsoft may still defend the judgment on other_grounds
as the supreme court said in united states v. american railway express co. 265_u.s._425 44_s.ct._560 68_l.ed._1087_(1924)` it is.. settled that the appellee may without taking a cross-appeal urge in support of a decree any matter appearing in the record'
id.at 435 44_s.ct._560
however under the circumstances of this case and because the issue of infringement was not addressed by the district_court we decline to reach the question of infringement for the first time on appeal

conclusion
we lack jurisdiction over microsofts cross-appeal
on the merits we conclude genuine_issues of fact remain as to whether the marquardt_document is prior_art and that summary_judgment of obviousness was improper
therefore the decision of the district_court granting summary_judgment of obviousness is

reversed and remanded

this is in contrast to a situation where the appellee urges invalidity as a new ground on which to support a judgment of non-infringement
in that situation a cross-appeal is necessary since a judgment of invalidity is broader than a judgment of non-infringement

typerights only other argument against the finding of obviousness is that there is a genuine_issue as to a motivation of one of skill in the art to combine the wrist_rest taught in the stack_reference with the v-shaped split keyboards shown in the marquardt_document
the stack_reference specifically teaches that` the concave split and split-and-turned models [ of keyboards ] are all ergonomically acceptable provided they are used at the correct angle of slope and height and in conjunction with a properly designed attached wrist_support'
( j.a.at 3553
the stack_reference does not as typeright argues teach away from such a combination
we therefore conclude that the district_court did not err in finding a motivation to combine as a matter of law
