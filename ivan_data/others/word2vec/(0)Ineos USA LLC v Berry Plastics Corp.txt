ineos_usa_llc accused berry_plastics corporation of infringing u.s. patent no._6846,863
ineos_appeals from the district_courts summary_judgment that the ¡¬863_patent is invalid as anticipated under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 2006
we affirm

*867 background
the ¡¬863_patent is directed to polyethylene-based compositions which can be used to form shaped_products such as screw caps for bottles
¡¬863_patent_col. 1_ll._5 -8
prior art polyethylene bottle caps incorporated a lubricant to optimize the caps slip_properties and to facilitate unscrewing of the cap
id
col. 1_ll._9 -14
however these compositions suffered the disadvantage of imparting bad odor and flavor to food products stored in contact with the compositions
id
col. 1_ll._15 -17
the ¡¬863_patent explains that its compositions having specific amounts of polyethylene lubricants and additives solve this problem
id
col. 1_ll._24 -35
claim 1 is the only independent claim and is illustrative 1
composition comprising at least [ 1 ] 94.5 % by weight of a polyethylene with a standard_density of more than 940 kg/m3 [ 2 ] 0.big_token__05_to_0__big_token5 % by weight of at least one saturated fatty_acid_amide represented by ch3 ch2 nconh2 in which n ranges from 6_to_28 [ ] [ 3 ] 0_to_015 % by weight of a subsidiary_lubricant selected from fatty_acids fatty_acid esters fatty_acid salts mono-unsaturated fatty_acid_amides polyols containing at least 4 carbon_atoms mono-or poly-alcohol monoethers glycerol esters paraffins polysiloxanes fluoropolymers and mixtures thereof and
[ 4 ] 0_to_5 % by weight of one or more additives selected from antioxidants antacids uv stabilizers colorants and antistatic agents
for ease of reference we refer to the various limitations by the respective bracketed numbers inserted into the claim

ineos alleged that berry_plastics infringes claims 1-big_token__7_and_9__big_token -11 of the ¡¬863_patent
berry_plastics moved for summary_judgment that the asserted claims are anticipated independently by various prior_art_references including u.s._patent_no._5948,846
the parties do not dispute that the ¡¬846_patent discloses 94.5 % by weight of a polyethylene with a standard_density of more than 940 kg/m3 as described in limitation 1 of claim 1 of the ¡¬863_patent

apr._15,_2014 ecf no._101 summary_judgment_order
likewise there is no dispute that stearamide disclosed in the ¡¬846_patent is a compound within the class of saturated fatty_acid_amides represented by ch3 ch2 nconh2 in which n ranges from 6_to_28` primary_lubricant' described in limitation 2
the court found that the ¡¬846_patents disclosure of a lubricant which could be stearamide in amounts from 0.big_token__1_to_5__big_token parts by weight,1 and more specifically of` at least 0.1 part by weight per 100 parts by weight of polyolefin in particular of at least 0.2 parts by weight quantities of at least 0.4 parts by weight being the most common_ones' describes specific values e.g. 0.1 part by weight along with the broader disclosure of the full range 0.big_token__1_to_5__big_token parts by weight
id.at 13-14
it therefore concluded that the ¡¬846_patents disclosure of stearamide in these amounts met limitation 2
id.at 11-14
it then determined that the subsidiary_lubricant of limitation 3 and the additive of limitation 4 are optional in the claimed composition because limitations 3_and_4 set forth ranges beginning with 0 %
id.at 14-16
it therefore found that the ¡¬846_patents disclosure of an optional_subsidiary_lubricant and an optional additive satisfied limitations 3_and_4
id
the court concluded that the ¡¬846_patent anticipates the asserted claims

independent claim 1
ineos argues that the court erred in finding claim 1 of the ¡¬863_patent anticipated by the ¡¬846_patent and in concluding that ineos failed to raise a genuine_dispute of material_fact in opposing summary_judgment
ineos asserts that the ¡¬846_patent discloses no single species within the genus of claim 1
it asserts that although the ¡¬846_patent discloses stearamide-one of the primary_lubricants of limitation 2-the ¡¬846_patent does not disclose or suggest that stearamide or any other primary_lubricant` should be included as a lubricant in an amount between 0.big_token__05_and_0__big_token5 % by weight while entirely excluding or severely limiting any other lubricant to no more than 0.15 % by weight'
appellants br

ineos argues that contrary to the courts conclusion the ¡¬846_patent discloses ranges for amounts of lubricants not particular individual point values
relying on atofina v. great lakes chemical corp. 441_f.3d_991_(fed.cir.2006) ineos argues that because the ranges concerning the amounts of lubricants disclosed in the ¡¬846_patent only slightly overlap with the ranges of limitations 2_and_3 in claim 1 of the ¡¬863_patent the ¡¬ 846 patent does not disclose these limitations
appellants br
28-32
ineos contends that at the very least under osram sylvania inc. v. american induction technologies inc. 701_f.3d_698 706 fed.cir.2012 the court should not have granted summary_judgment in light of ineoss proffered testimony that the ranges claimed in the ¡¬863_patent are critical
appellants br
33-35

berry_plastics responds that the court properly granted summary_judgment
it argues that the description in the ¡¬846_patent of stearamide in amounts of` at least 0.1 part by weight per 100 parts by weight of polyolefin in particular at least 0.2 parts by weight quantities of at least 0.4 parts by weight being the most common_ones' discloses particular_points i.e. 0.1 0.2 and 0.4 parts by weight within the range claimed in limitation 2 of claim 1 of the ¡¬863_patent i.e. 0.big_token__05_to_0__big_token5 % by weight
similarly berry_plastics argues that the court correctly concluded that because the compositions of the ¡¬846_patent contain` one or more lubricating agents' the ¡¬846_patent discloses that a subsidiary_lubricant is optional
berry_plastics asserts that the court therefore correctly found that the ¡¬846_patent met limitation 3 of claim 1 of the ¡¬863_patent
finally berry_plastics asserts that the court did not err in declining to consider the purported criticality of the claimed ranges in limitations 2_and_3 because such inquiry is not necessary where as here the prior_art discloses particular_points within the later claimed range

*869 we hold that the district_court correctly granted summary_judgment of anticipation
when a patent claims a range as in this case that range is anticipated by a prior_art_reference if the reference discloses a point within the range
titanium metals corp. v. banner 778_f.2d_775 782 fed.cir.1985
if the prior_art discloses its own range rather than a specific point then the prior_art is only anticipatory if it describes the claimed range with sufficient_specificity such that a reasonable_fact_finder could conclude that there is no reasonable difference in how the invention operates over the ranges
atofina 441 f.3d at 999 ; clearvalue inc. v. pearl river polymers inc. 668_f.3d_1340 1345 fed.cir.2012
limitation 2 is met by the disclosure of the ¡¬846_patent
the ¡¬846_patent_specification states the composition according to the invention includes the lubricating agent in a total_quantity of at least 0.1 part by weight per 100 parts by weight of polyolefin in particular of at least 0.2 parts by weight quantities of at least 0.4 parts by weight being the most common_ones ; the total_quantity of lubricating agents does not exceed 5 parts by weight more especially 2 parts by weight maximum values of 1 part by weight per 100 parts by weight of polyolefin being recommended
¡¬846_patent_col. 2_l._66 -col. 3_l._7_(emphasis_added)
the phrases` at least' and` does not exceed' set forth corresponding minimum and maximum amounts for the primary_lubricant
this portion of the specification clearly discloses ranges not particular individual values
as we stated in atofina` the disclosure of a range.. does not constitute a specific disclosure of the endpoints of that range'
441 f.3d at 1000
the court therefore erred in concluding that the ¡¬846_patent discloses particular_points within the range recited in limitation 2

this conclusion is not fatal to berry_plastics case however because ineos failed to raise a genuine_question of fact about whether the range claimed is critical to the operability of the invention
ineos has not demonstrated that atofina or osram requires reversal in this case

in atofina we reversed the district_courts finding of anticipation where the patent-in-suit claimed a temperature_range that was critical to the operability of the invention and the range disclosed in the prior_art was substantially different
atofina involved a patent claiming a method of synthesizing difluoromethane at a temperature between 330-450 ¢Xc
atofina 441 f.3d at 993 ; u.s._patent_no._5900 514_col._3 ll
61-62
atofinas patent and its prosecution history described the claimed temperature_range as critical to the invention and stated that the synthesis_reaction would not operate as claimed at a temperature outside the claimed range
see atofina j.a
1304 1306 1311-12 ; ¡¬514_patent col. 3_ll._61 -65 ; see also clearvalue 668 f.3d at 1344-45
the prior_art at issue in atofina disclosed a broad temperature_range of 100-500 ¢Xc
atofina 441 f.3d at 999
the patent-in-suit was not anticipated because there was a` considerable_difference' between the prior_arts broad disclosure and the claimed` critical' temperature_range such that` no reasonable_fact_finder could conclude that the prior_art describes the claimed range with sufficient_specificity to anticipate this limitation of the claim'
id.at 999 ; see also clearvalue 668 f.3d at 1345
key to this conclusion was the fact that the evidence showed that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have expected the synthesis_reaction to operate differently or not all outside of the temperature_range claimed in the patent-in-suit
atofina 441 f.3d at 999 ; see also clearvalue 668 f.3d at 1345

*870 in clearvalue we further explained the importance of establishing the criticality of a claimed range to the claimed invention in order to avoid anticipation by a prior_art_reference disclosing a broader overlapping range
the patent at issue in clearvalue claimed a method` for clarification of water of raw alkalinity less than or equal to 50 ppm by chemical treatment'
668 f.3d at 1342 emphasis added
after a jury found clearvalues patent not anticipated by prior_art disclosing clarifying water with alkalinity of` 150 ppm or less' we reversed and held the patent invalid as anticipated
id.at 1342-46
notably clearvalue did not argue that the claimed range was critical to the invention or that the claimed method would work differently within the prior_art_range of 150 ppm or less
id
`` [ u ] nlike atofina where there was a broad genus and evidence that different portions of the broad range would work differently' in clearvalue` there [ was ] no allegation of criticality or evidence demonstrating any difference across the range'
id.at 1345
there was no considerable_difference between how the method would operate within the claimed range and within the range disclosed in the prior_art
id

we have however reversed a grant of summary_judgment of anticipation where the patentee raised a genuine_dispute of material_fact concerning the criticality of a claimed range
in osram the patentee argued that the claimed pressure range` less than 0.5 torr' was critical to the operation of its claimed lamp assembly
osram 701 f.3d at 701 705-06
there the patentee presented expert_testimony and evidence supporting its assertion that the` less than 0.5 torr' limitation was` central to the invention claimed' and` that a lamp would operate differently at various points within the range disclosed' in the prior_art_reference at issue
id.at 706
this evidence was unrebutted
id
we emphasized that` how one of ordinary_skill in the art would understand the relative size of a genus or species in a particular technology is of critical importance'
id
noting the district_courts failure to justify its rejection of osrams expert_testimony and the lack of support for the courts conclusion that the claimed range was narrowly encompassed within the prior_art_range we reversed
id

in this case ineos argues that because the prior_art_¡¬846_patent discloses a range that overlaps with the range recited in limitation 2 the court should not have found claim 1 anticipated
ineos asserts that it presented unrebutted evidence that the range recited in limitation 2 is critical to the invention and therefore under osram the court erred in granting summary_judgment in berry_plastics favor

the courts conclusion that limitation 2 was met by the ¡¬846_patent was correct because ineos did not raise a genuine_question of fact about whether the range recited in limitation 2 is critical to the invention
the ¡¬863_patent specification indicates that the lubricants included in the invention function to improve the caps slip_properties and ability to be unscrewed from a bottle
¡¬863_patent_col. 1_ll._10 -12
it then describes the novelty of the invention as eliminating the odor and taste_problems associated with prior_art bottle caps while still maintaining good slip_properties
id
col. 1_ll._20 -23 col. 3_l._66 -col. 4_l._2
ineos has not established that any of these properties would differ if the range from the prior_art_¡¬846_patent is substituted for the range of limitation 2

ineos relies on the testimony of one of the inventors of the ¡¬863_patent stating that the range claimed in limitation 2 is critical to avoid unnecessary manufacturing costs and the appearance of undesirable_blemishes on the bottle caps
appellants *big_token__871_br._33__big_token -34
but even if true this has nothing to do with the operability or functionality of the claimed invention
ineos has not established any relationship between avoided cost and prevention of undesirable_blemishes and the claimed inventions slip_properties or elimination of odor and taste_problems
ineos does not suggest that the claimed inventions slip_properties or improved odor and taste properties would not have been expected based on the prior_art
while we do not rule out the possibility that testimony concerning reduced manufacturing costs could be relevant where a method of manufacture claim is at issue this is not the case before us.2

ineos is correct that with regard to limitation 2 the ¡¬846_patent discloses a range and not a point within the range
ineos is also correct that when the prior_art discloses a range rather than a point the court must evaluate whether the patentee has established that the claimed range is critical to the operability of the claimed invention
here however ineos failed to put forth facts in opposition to summary_judgment that created a genuine_issue of material_fact about the criticality of the range of limitation 2
there is no evidence that the operability of the bottle cap would be improved by the claimed range

limitation 3 is also met by the ¡¬846_patent and ineoss argument concerning the criticality of limitation 3 does not save the claim
the ¡¬ 846 patent discloses compositions containing a single lubricating agent` one' and allows for additional lubricating agents
¡¬846_patent_col. 1_ll._48 -50
we like the district_court interpret this language as expressly disclosing a composition with only one lubricating agent-the primary_lubricant-and zero subsidiary_lubricant
limitation 3 requires a subsidiary_lubricant present in an amount between 0_and_015 % by weight
because the ¡¬ 846 patent discloses 0 % of subsidiary_lubricant limitation 3 is satisfied
ineoss criticality evidence is not relevant because that inquiry is appropriate only where the prior_art discloses a range not a particular value within the later claimed range
we see no error in the district_courts analysis on this point.3

ii
dependent claim 3
claim 3 which depends from claim 1 specifies that the primary_lubricant is the saturated fatty_acid_amide_behenamide
the court found that because behenamide is one of a few common saturated fatty_acid_amide lubricating agents the ¡¬846_patents disclosure of the genus of saturated fatty_acid_amides anticipates claim 3
summary_judgment_order at 19-20 citing in re petering 49_ccpa_993 301_f.2d_676_(1962)

ineos argues that the court erred in finding claim 3 anticipated
it argues that the ¡¬846_patent does not explicitly disclose behenamide and that the court incorrectly concluded that the genus of saturated fatty_acid_amides disclosed in the ¡¬846_patent describes behenamide
it asserts that the court incorrectly concluded that behen-amide is a common saturated fatty_acid_amide lubricating agent
it asserts that the only *872 pertinent record evidence is ineoss inventor_declaration stating that behenamide was not recognized as` as one of the more effective lubricants for products'

we affirm the courts conclusion that claim 3 is anticipated
with respect to claim 3 the ¡¬846_patent_specification discloses the genus of saturated fatty_acid_amides and states that good results are achieved with the narrower genus of saturated fatty_acid_amides having 12_to_35 carbon_atoms
¡¬846_patent_col. 2_ll._48 -52 59-61
behenamide falls within the narrower preferred genus because it is a saturated fatty_acid_amide with 22 carbon_atoms
berry_plastics asserted that behenamide is a common lubricating agent and supported that contention with an expert declaration stating that behenamide is a common fatty_acid_amide used in the packaging industry
from this evidence we can not conclude that the court erred in finding that the ¡¬ 846 patent discloses behena-mide
ineos has not demonstrated that it raised a genuine_dispute of material_fact with respect to claim 3
verbatim disclosure of a particular species is not required in every case for anticipation because disclosure of a small genus can be a disclosure of each species within the genus
see atofina 441 f.3d at 999 citing in re petering 301 f.2d at 682
ineos does not dispute that behenamide falls within the narrow genus of saturated fatty_acid_amides having 12_to_35 carbon_atoms
and ineos provided no detailed information on how large this genus is to support its contention that this genus does not disclose behenamide
ineoss inventor_declaration does not state that behenamide is not a common lubricant within this species
we conclude that ineos did not raise a genuine_dispute of material_fact with respect to claim 3

we affirm the grant of summary_judgment of anticipation
