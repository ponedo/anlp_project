i
the624_patent discloses_vitamin_supplement_compositions to lower serum homocysteine levels and protect against related blood vessel disorders
'624_patent abstract
the646_patent discloses_vitamin_supplement_compositions to prevent brain and nervous system damage and pernicious anemia
'646_patent abstract
specifically the624 and646_patent s claim vitamin_supplement_compositions consisting of vitamin_b12 folic_acid folate and in some instances vitamin_b6
'624_patent col._2,_ll._15-19 ;646_patent col. 2 ii
25-29
claim 1 of the624_patent for instance states a vitamin or supplement composition adapted for administration to a human the active components thereof consisting essentially of a member selected from the group consisting of a folic_acid and vitamin_b12 ; b folic_acid vitamin_b12 and vitamin_b6 ; c folic_acid vitamin_b12 and a non-antioxidant vitamin ; and
( d folic_acid vitamin_b12 and non-antioxidant vitamins said composition being essentially free of anti [ ] oxidants
'624_patent col. 4 ii
21-32
importantly the asserted claims of the624 and646_patent s contain the requirement that the compositions be` essentially free of antioxidants'

the prior_art contains many vitamin_supplement_compositions comprising vitamin_b12 folate and vitamin_b6
however the prior_art that teaches compositions consisting of vitamin_b12 folate and vitamin_b6 also teaches adding other vitamins and antioxidants to provide additional health benefits
dr. victor herbert the named inventor of the624 and646_patent s discovered that including antioxidants in such compositions destroys some of the vitamin_b12 and folate
dr._herbert obtained the624 and646_patent s based on that discovery
dr._herbert distinguished the prior_art by claiming compositions that expressly exclude antioxidants
indeed upsher-smith admits that the only difference between the asserted claims and the prior_art is the claims negative_limitation excluding antioxidants

in addition to teaching vitamin_supplement_compositions comprising vitamin_b12 folate and vitamin_b6 the prior_art recognized that several substances known to be antioxidants were also known to destroy vitamin_b12 and folate
specifically an article published more than forty years before the filing dates of the624 and646_patent s recognized that vitamins c and e both of which were known antioxidants are` incompatible' with vitamin_b12
thomas j. macek & beate a. feller crystalline vitamin b12 in pharmaceutical preparations 41 journal of the am
pharm
assoc. no._6 at 285 1952
dr. hebert also published an article more than twenty years before the filing the date of the624 and646_patent s teaching that vitamin c destroys vitamin_b12
victor herbert md jd & elizabeth jacob md destruction of vitamin b12 by asorbic acid 230 journal of the am
med
assoc. no._2 at 241 oct._14,_1974
thus the prior_art teaches that certain substances known as antioxidants destroy vitamin_b12
the prior_art does not teach however that the antioxidizing properties of those substances are responsible for this destruction
as described above dr._herbert discovered that relationship

against this background the district_court decided pamlabs motions for summary *1322 judgment of invalidity for anticipation and obviousness
the district_court found the asserted claims of the624 and646_patent s anticipated by european patent application no._9331147623 filed sept._14,_1993 european_application2624 order at 11-12 ;646 order at 4-5
the european_application discloses the same compositions claimed in the624 and646_patent s with the difference that the european_application` optionally includes' antioxidants
the district_court found that because the european_application teaches compositions both with and without the antioxidants it anticipates the asserted claims of the624 and646_patent s.624 order at 11 ;646 order at 4-5
upsher-smith appeals
this court has jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

ii
anticipation is a question of fact
elan pharm. inc. v. mayo found
for med
educ
& research 346_f.3d_1051 1054 fed.cir.2003
however this court reviews grants of summary_judgment without deference
knoll pharm co. v. teva pharms
usa inc. 367_f.3d_1381 1384 fed.cir.2004
`` summary judgment is therefore appropriate when there is no genuine_issue of material_fact or when drawing all factual inferences in favor of the nonmoving party noreasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party
`` omega eng g inc. v. raytek corp. 334_f.3d_1314 1320 fed.cir.2003 quoting anderson v. liberty lobby inc. 477_u.s._242 248 106_s.ct._2505 91_l.ed.2d_202_(1986)

upsher-smith concedes that the european_application contains every element of the asserted claims of the624 and646_patent s except the limitation` essentially free of antioxidants'
nevertheless upsher-smith argues that because the european_application optionally includes antioxidants the district_court erred in finding that it anticipates a limitation that expressly excludes antioxidants

first upsher-smith argues that the district_court erred by placing the burden on upsher-smith to prove that the negative_limitation was not found in the prior_art rather than on pamlab to prove the presence of the negative_limitation in the prior_art
the district_court did not so err
a century-old axiom of patent law holds that a product` which would literally infringe if later in time anticipates if earlier'
schering corp. v. geneva_pharms. inc. 339_f.3d_1373 1379 fed.cir.2003 quoting bristol-myers_squibb_co. v. ben venue labs. inc. 246_f.3d_1368 1378 fed.cir.2001 ; accord peters v. active mfg co. 129_u.s._530 537 9_s.ct._389 32_l.ed._738_(1889)` that which infringes if later would anticipate if earlier`
the european_applications` optional inclusion' of antioxidants teaches vitamin_supplement_compositions that both do and do not contain antioxidants
thus because compositions made according to the european_application that do not contain antioxidants would infringe the asserted claims of the624 and646_patent s those compositions anticipate the asserted claims despite no express teaching to exclude the antioxidants in the european_application
consequently pamlab presented a prima facie case of anticipation and the district_court properly placed the burden on upsher-smith to present rebuttal evidence sufficient to raise a genuine_issue of material *1323 fact of no anticipation by the european_application

in an attempt to rebut pamlabs evidence of anticipation upsher-smith argues that the european_applications discussion of the benefits of adding antioxidants to the compositions actually teaches away from expressly excluding antioxidants
however` a reference is no less anticipatory if after disclosing the invention the reference then disparages it
thus the question whether a referenceteaches away from the invention is inapplicable to an anticipation analysis'
bristol-myers_squibb_co. 246 f.3d at 1378 quoting celeritas techs. ltd. v. rockwell int l corp. 150_f.3d_1354 1361 fed.cir.1998
consequently this argument does not raise an issue of material_fact

upsher-smith argues next that the european_application teaches a` genus' of compositions that can not anticipate the` species' compositions claimed in the624 and646_patent s. this court has recognized that a prior` genus' will not necessarily prevent patenting of a` species'
eli lilly & co. v. bd
of regents of univ
of wa. 334_f.3d_1264 1270 fed.cir.2003
however this principle is not applicable to the facts of this case because the asserted claims of the624 and646_patent s are not limited to a` species' of the compositions taught by the european_application
the compositions claimed in the624 and646_patent s are as equally broad as the compositions taught by the european_application without antioxidants
consequently the claims of the624 and646_patent s are not` species' of the compositions taught by the european_application

at the heart of this case dr._herbert appears to have been the first to precisely articulate that antioxidants destroy vitamin_b12 and folate
consequently he observed that vitamin_supplement_compositions comprising vitamin_b12 and folate are more effective without antioxidants
at the time of dr._herberts observation however vitamin_supplement_compositions consisting of vitamin_b12 and folate and essentially free of antioxidants were known in the prior_art
while this court does not discount the significance of dr._herberts discovery` [ t ] he public remains free to make use or sell prior_art compositions or processes regardless of whether or not they understand their complete makeup or the underlying scientific principles which allow them to operate'
atlas powder co. v. ireco inc. 190_f.3d_1342 1348-49 fed.cir.1999 ; accord schering corp. v. geneva_pharms. inc. 339_f.3d_1373 1379-80 fed.cir.2003
consequently dr._herberts discovery of the scientific principles explaining the reasons that prior_art vitamin_supplement_compositions comprising vitamin_b12 and folate and essentially free of antioxidants are more effective than similar compositions containing antioxidants does not entitle him to remove that prior_art from the public_domain by patenting those compositions

this case comes very close to the reasoning in emi group north america inc. v. cypress semiconductor corp. 268_f.3d_1342_(fed.cir.2001)
in that case this court explained that people had used fires for thousands of years before the first discovery of oxygen as a component of combustion
the first discoverer of the role of oxygen could not have hypothetically claimed a method of making fire with oxygen
id.at 1351
similarly dr._herbert can not withdraw some vitamin compositions from the public_domain by explaining or purporting to claim the scientific underpinnings of their operation

iii
because the district_court properly found that there is no genuine_issue on the *1324 fact that the european_application teaches every element of the asserted claims of the624 and646_patent s the district_courts summary_judgment of invalidity of the asserted claims of the624 and646_patent s are affirmed

upsher-smith originally filed a complaint for declaratory judgment against pan_american_laboratories inc. pan_am and metabolite_laboratories inc. metabolite for noninfringement invalidity and unenforceability of u.s._patent_nos._5735 873_and_5563,126
upsher-smith amended its complaint to include infringement of the claims of the624_patent by panam and metabolite and infringement of the claims of the646_patent by pan_american_laboratories l.l.c
and pamlab
metabolite was dismissed as a party for lack of jurisdiction and pan_am no longer exists

because this court affirms the district_courts anticipation findings in light of the european_application this opinion will not address the district_courts additional anticipation and obviousness findings
