halliburton_energy_services inc.` halliburton' appeals from a final_judgment of the united_states_district_court for the eastern_district of texas
halliburton_energy_services inc. v. m-i_llc no._605-cv-155 e.d.tex
nov._20,_2006` judgment order'
the district_court granted summary_judgment in favor of m-i_llc` m-i' holding that independent_claims 1-big_token__3_and_5__big_token and their asserted dependent_claims of u.s. patent no._6887,832 b2` the ¡¬ 832 patent' were invalid as indefinite under 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?

we heard oral_argument on november 7 2007
because a claim_term in each asserted claim lacked clear meaning to the ordinary artisan we affirm

i. halliburton is the assignee of the ¡¬832_patent which relates to oil_field_drilling_fluids that are fragile_gels
in the process of drilling such wells drilling_fluid is used for a variety of purposes such as` removing drill_cuttings from the wellbore cooling and lubricating the drill bit aiding in support of the drill pipe and drill bit and providing a hydrostatic head to maintain the integrity of the wellbore walls and prevent well blowouts'
¡¬ 832 patent col.1 ii.27-31

the ¡¬832_patent_claims recite certain fragile_gel drilling_fluids
claim 1 for example recites 1
a method for conducting a drilling operation in a subterranean formation using a fragile_gel drilling_fluid comprising a an invert_emulsion_base ; b one or more thinners ; c one or more emulsifiers ; and
( d one or more weighting agents wherein said operation includes running casing in a borehole
( emphasis added

during prosecution halliburton distinguished the claims of the ¡¬832_patent from prior_art_fluids by stating that the claims were` limited to' a` fragile_gel' drilling_fluid or the method of using a` fragile_gel' drilling_fluid
thus although the term` fragile_gel' appears only in the preamble of the asserted_independent_claims halliburton concedes that the claimed drilling_fluids are limited to those that are` fragile_gels'
pitney bowes inc. v. hewlett-packard co. 182_f.3d_1298 1305 fed.cir.1999` if the claim_preamble when read in the context of the entire claim recites limitations of the claim or if the claim_preamble isnecessary to give life meaning and vitality to the claim then the claim_preamble should be construed as if in the balance of the claim'
( citations omitted
the specification defines` fragile_gels' as follows a` fragile_gel' as used herein is a` gel' that is easily disrupted or thinned and that liquifies or becomes less_gel-like and more liquid-like under stress such as caused by moving the fluid but which quickly returns to a gel when the movement or other_stress is alleviated or removed such as when circulation of the fluid is stopped as for example when drilling is stopped
the` fragileness' of the` fragile_gels' of the present_invention contributes to the unique and surprising *1247 behavior and advantages of the present_invention
the gels are so` fragile' that it is believed that they may be disrupted by a mere pressure wave or a compression wave during drilling
they seem to break instantaneously when disturbed reversing from a gel back into a liquid form with minimum_pressure force and time and with less pressure force and time than known to be required to convert prior_art_fluids from a gel-like_state into a flowable state
¡¬832_patent_col.2_ii.26-42

in may 2005 halliburton sued m-i in the united_states_district_court for the eastern_district of texas alleging that m-is rheliant drilling mud system infringed certain claims of the ¡¬832_patent
m-i moved for summary_judgment of invalidity arguing that the asserted claims of the ¡¬832_patent were invalid for indefiniteness lack of enablement and/or lack of written description
after holding a combined markman and motion hearing to address claim_construction disputes as well as m-is motion for summary_judgment of invalidity the district_court granted m-is motion for summary_judgment finding that all asserted claims of the ¡¬832_patent were invalid as indefinite
halliburton energy serv. inc. v. m-i_llc 456_f.supp.2d_811 825 e.d.tex.2006

first the district_court looked at the definition of fragile_gel in the specification and found that it was too subjective and unclear because it relied on terms such as` easily transitions'` easily disrupted or thinned'` less_gel-like'` more liquid-like'` quickly returns to a gel'` break instantaneously' and` minimum_pressure force and time'
id.at 817
additionally the district_court rejected halliburtons argument that figure 3 depicted below and figure 41 of the ¡¬832_patent distinguish the invention from the prior_art
id.at 822-23

*1248. ?
fig._3
sf_fluids are prior_art_fluids whereas accolade tm fluids have the characteristics of the invention of the ¡¬832_patent
¡¬832_patent col.4 i.65-col.5 i.7
in figure 3 at around the 70 minute mark the height of the curve when stress is applied represents the strength of the gel that the fluid forms at rest and the speed at which the curve falls back on itself indicates how quickly the gel breaks i.e. transitions back to a liquid_state
the district_court found that this graph did not delineate the bounds of the invention because both prior_art_fluids and fluids of the invention_exhibit the same shape curves the curves of the 12.1 sf 12.65 accolade and 15.6 accolade fluids all fall directly back on themselves
halliburton 456 f.supp.2d at 820
the primary difference between these fluids is the height of the curves i.e. the strength of the gels formed but the district_court found that halliburton had produced no evidence of` precisely how high the vertical leg of a fluids l-shaped curve must reach-i.e. howstrong a gel must be-for that fluid to exhibitfragile_gel behavior
`` id

the district_court also noted that halliburtons proposed additional limitation to the term` fragile_gel' that it contains no or only low_amounts of organophilic_clay or lignite was improperly imported from the specification which states that the fragile_gel of certain embodiments of the invention of the patent preferably does not have these clays
id.at 824
the court found that the doctrine of claim_differentiation further counseled against this construction because dependent_claims added the limitation that the fluid is` substantially free of organophilic_clay'
id.at 824-25

in november 2006 the court issued a final_judgment that all asserted claims of the ¡¬832_patent were proven invalid as indefinite held that all other issues of infringement and validity were moot and dismissed m-is counterclaims without prejudice
this timely appeal followed
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

*1249 ii
we review both a district_courts grant of summary_judgment and a conclusion that a claim is indefinite under 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?

35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
2 requires that the specification of a patent` conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject_matter which the applicant regards as his invention'
because claims delineate the patentees right to exclude the patent statute requires that the scope of the claims be sufficiently definite to inform the public of the bounds of the protected invention i.e. what subject_matter is covered by the exclusive rights of the patent
otherwise competitors can not avoid infringement defeating the public notice_function of patent_claims

united_carbon co. v. binney & smith co. 317_u.s._228 236 63_s.ct._165 87_l.ed._232_(1942)

this court has applied the definiteness requirement of 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
2 in numerous circumstances
for example we have held claims indefinite where a claim recites means-plus-function elements without disclosing corresponding structure in the specification biomedino llc v. waters techs corp. 490_f.3d_946 950 fed.cir.2007 includes a numeric_limitation without disclosing which of multiple methods of measuring that number should be used honeywell int l inc. v. int l_trade_comm n 341_f.3d_1332 1340 fed.cir.2003 and contains a term that is` completely dependent on a persons subjective opinion' datamize 417 f.3d at 1350
we have also stated that a claim could be indefinite if a term does not have proper antecedent basis where such basis is not otherwise present by implication or the meaning is not reasonably ascertainable
energizer holdings inc. v. int l_trade_comm n 435_f.3d_1366 1370-71 fed.cir.2006
the common thread in all of these cases is that claims were held indefinite only where a person of ordinary_skill in the art could not determine the bounds of the claims i.e. the claims were insolubly ambiguous

of course claims are not indefinite merely because they present a difficult_task of claim_construction
instead` [ i ] f the meaning of the claim is discernible even though the task may be formidable and the conclusion may be one over which reasonable persons will disagree we have held the claim sufficiently clear to avoid invalidity on indefiniteness grounds'
exxon_research & eng g co. v. united_states 265_f.3d_1371 1375 fed.cir.2001 citations omitted
proof of indefiniteness requires such an exacting standard because claim_construction often poses a difficult_task over which` expert witnesses trial courts and even the judges of this court may disagree'
id
nevertheless this standard is met where an accused infringer shows by clear and convincing_evidence that a skilled_artisan could not discern the boundaries of the claim based on the claim language the specification *1250 and the prosecution_history as well as her knowledge of the relevant_art_area

in this case the district_court found that the asserted claims which contained the limitation that the drilling_fluid be a` fragile_gel' were indefinite
`` only claimsnot amenable to construction orinsolubly ambiguous are indefinite'
datamize 417 f.3d at 1347 citing novo indus. l.p. v. micro molds corp. 350_f.3d_1348 1353 fed.cir.2003 ; honeywell 341 f.3d at 1338 ; exxon_research 265 f.3d at 1375
because we conclude that neither halliburtons proposed definition nor any other possible construction resolves the ambiguity in the scope of the term` fragile_gel' we agree with the district_court that claims containing that term are indefinite.2

halliburton argues that` fragile_gel' as used in the asserted claims is definite and has a three-part definition 1 a gel that easily transitions to a liquid_state upon the introduction of force e.g. when drilling starts and returns to a gel when the force is removed e.g. when drilling stops ; and
2 at rest is capable of suspending drill_cuttings and weighting_materials ; and
3 contains no organophilic_clay or organophilic lignite or can contain low_amounts of organophilic_clay or lignite individually or in combination so that the fragile_gel can still easily transition between a gel and liquid_state and suspend drill_cuttings and weighting_materials

we address the third part of halliburtons definition no or low_organophilic_clay or lignite first and conclude that` fragile_gels' that have no or low_organophilic_clay or lignite are merely preferred embodiments of the invention covered by certain dependent_claims and thus` fragile_gel' as used in the independent_claims is not limited to those embodiments

the specification of the ¡¬832_patent states that one of the advantages of the invention is that it` suspends drill_cuttings through its gel or gel-like characteristics without need for organophilic_clays to add viscosity to the fluid'
¡¬832_patent col.2 ii.48-51 emphasis added
it also states that` preferably no organophilic_clays are added to the drilling_fluid for use in the invention'
id.at col.3 ii.51-53 emphasis added

contrary to halliburtons argument nothing in the specification of the ¡¬832_patent requires the fragile_gel drilling_fluid *1251 as claimed to have low or no organophilic_clay
instead the specification merely says there is no need for such clays
absence of need for a component does not necessarily mean that that component is absent or present only in low_amounts
additionally the specification states that` preferably' none of these clays are added ; this strongly suggests that absence of clays is simply a preferred embodiment
this reading is reinforced by the dependent_claims claims 20 58 95 125 add the limitation that the fluid is` substantially free of organophilic_clay'
thus a requirement of low or no organophilic_clays is not properly part of the construction of` fragile_gel' as contained in the asserted_independent_claims

we next review the remainder of halliburtons proposed definition
the first two parts of halliburtons definition i.e. that fragile_gels are those that easily transition to a liquid_state upon the introduction of force and return to a gel when the force is removed and those that are capable of suspending drill_cuttings and weighting_materials at rest are indeed supported by the specification
regarding the first_part the specification states a` fragile_gel' as used herein is a` gel' that is easily disrupted or thinned and that liquifies or becomes less_gel-like and more liquid-like under stress such as caused by moving the fluid but which quickly returns to a gel when the movement or other_stress is alleviated or removed such as when circulation of the fluid is stopped as for example when drilling is stopped
¡¬832_patent_col.2_ii.26-33
and regarding the second_part when drilling is stopped while using a drilling_fluid of the present_invention and consequently the stresses or forces associated with drilling are substantially reduced or removed the drilling_fluid forms a gel structure that allows it to suspend drill_cuttings and weighting_materials for delivery to the well surface
id.at col.2 ii.43-48

the fact that halliburton can articulate a definition supported by the specification however does not end the inquiry
even if a claim_terms definition can be reduced to words the claim is still indefinite if a person of ordinary_skill in the art can not translate the definition into meaningfully precise claim_scope
having reviewed the remaining two parts of halliburtons proposed construction both individually and in combination in the context of the intrinsic_record and the knowledge of a person of ordinary_skill in the art we hold that the ambiguity as to the scope of` fragile_gel' can not be resolved

halliburton argues that the first_part of its definition i.e. a gel that easily transitions from gel to liquid and back again is sufficiently objective so that a skilled_artisan would understand the limits of the claimed` fragile_gel'
halliburton primarily focuses on the l-shaped curve shown in figure 3 of the ¡¬832_patent3 *1252 according to halliburton a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have interpreted figure 3 as requiring that fragile_gels of the invention_exhibit` l-shaped' curves when tested with an off-the-shelf brookfield viscometer
figure 3 shows brookfield test data for two fluids of the ¡¬832_patent accolade and two prior_art_fluids sf
halliburton argues that the key feature of the l-shaped curve is that it falls directly back onto itself when force is applied
while halliburton admits that the prior_art 12.1 sf_fluid also exhibits this very same feature it notes that the heavier 15.6 sf_fluid does not
halliburton argues however that whether the prior_art i.e. 12.1 sf_fluid is covered by the claim as construed is properly addressed in validity challenges of other types anticipation obviousness etc
rather than in claim_construction or in evaluating definiteness
we disagree that the evaluation of a claims definiteness can not include whether the patent expressly or at least clearly differentiates itself from specific prior_art
such differentiation is an important consideration in the definiteness inquiry because in attempting to define a claim_term a person of ordinary_skill is likely to conclude that the definition does not encompass that which is expressly distinguished as prior_art

of course that is not to suggest that a claim can never be definite and yet read on the prior_art
for example a claim that recites a specific numeric range for a physical_property may be definite even though prior_art products fell within that range
in such a case a person of ordinary_skill in the art would know the boundaries of the claim and the focus would properly be on other validity challenges e.g. anticipation

this case presents a different situation however
here in describing figure 3 the figure on which halliburton primarily relies in asserting that` fragile_gel' is definite the patent specification stated that figure 3 distinguished the fluids of the invention accolade from the prior_art_fluids sf fig._3 indicates superior response and performance by the drilling_fluids of the present_invention
not only do the fluids of the present_invention build up more gel when at rest which enables the fluids of the invention to better maintain weight materials and drill_cuttings in suspension when at rest-a time prior_art_fluids are more likely to have difficulty suspending such solid materials-but the fluids of the present_invention nevertheless surprisingly provide less_resistance to the sheer which will result in lower ecds as will be discussed further below
¡¬832_patent col.6 ii.5-14 emphases added
a person of ordinary_skill would not have ignored these explicit teachings but rather would have looked to figure 3 to try to determine the bounds of the claims

*1253 thus we reject halliburtons assertion that a` fragile_gel' can be defined by an l-shaped curve alone because the specification does not distinguish how the` fragile_gels' claimed in the ¡¬832_patent performed differently than the disclosed prior_art-how much more quickly the gels broke when stress was imposed or how much more quickly the gels reformed when stress was removed
halliburtons failure to distinguish the fragileness of the drilling_fluids of the invention from the close prior_art the 12.1 sf_fluid that exhibited the l-shaped curve_behavior is fatal
amgen inc. v. chugai pharm co. ltd. 927_f.2d_1200 1218 fed.cir.1991 holding that the term` at least about' was indefinite because the patent provided no guidance as to where the line should be drawn between the numerical value of the prior_art cited in the prosecution_history and the close numerical value in the patent ; see also verve llc v. crane cams inc. 311_f.3d_1116 1119-20 fed.cir.2002 recognizing that guidance as to measurement of a term of degree can come from the intrinsic_record or from the knowledge of a person of ordinary_skill in the art

even if the ¡¬832_patent distinguished` fragile_gels' of the invention from those of the prior_art it did not place any limit on the scope of what was invented beyond the prior_art
by halliburtons own admission drilling_fluids which included an invert_emulsion_base a thinner an emulsifier and a weighting agent were known in the prior_art and independent_claims 1-big_token__3_and_5__big_token are distinguishable from the prior_art only because they are` fragile_gels'
by failing to identify the degree of the fragility of its invention halliburtons proposed definition would allow the claims to cover not only that which it invented that was superior to the prior_art but also all future_improvements to the gels fragility.4 while patentees are allowed to claim their inventions broadly they must do so in a way that distinctly identifies the boundaries of their claims
the fluids of the ¡¬832 invention may provide less_resistance to shear i.e. break more quickly than the prior_art_fluids but the degree of improved speed remains ambiguous
thus it is unclear whether a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have interpreted this claim as having an upper_bound of fragility.5

we note that where a claim is ambiguous as to its scope we have adopted a narrowing construction when doing so would still serve the notice_function of the claims
see athletic_alternatives 73 f.3d at 1581` where there is an equal choice between a broader and a narrower_meaning of a claim and there is an enabling disclosure that indicates that the applicant is at least entitled to a claim having the narrower_meaning we consider the notice *1254 function of the claim to be best served by adopting the narrower_meaning`
in this case however halliburton asks that we resolve the ambiguity in a way that gives it the broadest_possible_construction i.e. that its claim covers all future_improvements without regard to whether halliburton invented such improvements ; such a construction would undermine the notice_function of the claims because it would allow halliburton to benefit from the ambiguity rather than requiring halliburton to give proper notice of the scope of the claims to competitors
additionally adopting the broadest_possible_construction could retard innovation because cautious competitors may steer too far around that which halliburton actually invented neglecting improvements that otherwise might be made
we thus hold that the term` fragile_gel' is not sufficiently definite if construed in accordance with the first_part of halliburtons proposed definition because a person of ordinary_skill in the art could not determine how quickly the gel must transition to a liquid when force is applied and how quickly it must return to a gel when the force is removed

the second_part of halliburtons definition i.e. the fragile_gel is capable of suspending drill_cuttings and weighting_materials at rest fares no better because nothing in the record suggests what degree of such capability is sufficient
halliburton argues that a person of ordinary_skill would know how to measure the quantity of drill_cuttings suspended in a fluid either through laboratory measurements or in the field for example by measuring weight or density of the fluid when entering the borehole and when exiting the borehole and would also know how to determine when the fluid no longer exhibited the l-shaped curve_behavior when tested with a brookfield viscometer
the fact that an artisan would know how to perform these measurements and tests however says nothing about whether the artisan would also know which fluids were` fragile_gels' as that term is used in the claims of the ¡¬832_patent

assuming a person of ordinary_skill would add solids incrementally determining the effect of each addition by observing whether the fluid still maintains its fragile_gel characteristics the l-shaped curve as halliburton suggests this testing protocol still does not answer the fundamental question what quantity weight size and/or volume of cuttings must be suspended ?
halliburton does not attempt to resolve this ambiguity instead arguing that this limitation merely means adequate for the circumstances

in geneva_pharmaceuticals inc. v. glaxosmithkline plc 349_f.3d_1373 1384 fed.cir.2003 we refused to adopt a proposed construction for` synergistically effective amount'` a formulation falls outside the scope of the claims if a given antibiotic bacteria and disease combination provides no synergy' because the construction would have been indefinite
because the patent_claims at issue did not identify the specific bacteria we rejected the proposed construction because` a given embodiment would simultaneously infringe and not infringe the claims depending on the particular bacteria chosen for analysis'
id
we concluded that such a construction that results in an artisan not knowing from` one bacterium to the next whether a particular composition standing alone is within the claim_scope or not' was` the epitome of indefiniteness'
id

as in geneva_pharmaceuticals under halliburtons proposed construction in this case an artisan would not know from one well to the next whether a certain drilling_fluid was within the scope of the claims because a wide variety of factors could affect adequacy formation geology wellbore *1255 size depth angle etc
in other_words a given fluid might be adequate to suspend drill_cuttings in some formations and/or well configurations whereas in others it would not be
when a proposed construction requires that an artisan make a separate infringement determination for every set of circumstances in which the composition may be used and when such determinations are likely to result in differing outcomes sometimes infringing and sometimes not that construction is likely to be indefinite

we also note that the two parts of halliburtons proposed definition discussed above ability of the fluid to transition quickly from gel to liquid and the ability of the fluid to suspend drill_cuttings at rest are functional i.e. the fluid is defined` by what it does rather than what it is'
in re swinehart 58_c.c.p.a._1027 439_f.2d_210 212 1971
the supreme_court in two early cases identified the dangers of using only functional claim_limitations to distinguish the claimed invention from the prior_art
in general_electric the court held that a vice of functional_claiming occurs` when the inventor is painstaking when he recites what has already been seen and then uses conveniently functional_language at the exact point of novelty'
general_electric 304 u.s. at 371 58_s.ct._899 holding claims invalid where the grains of the claimed lighting filament were distinguished from the prior_art only because they were` of such size and contour as to prevent substantial sagging and offsetting' of the filament during the commercially useful life of the lamp
likewise in united_carbon the court held indefinite claims that recited only` inaccurate suggestions of the functions of the product'
united_carbon 317 u.s. at 234 63_s.ct._165 holding indefinite patent_claims that recited for example` sustantially sic pure carbon black in the form of commercially uniform comparatively small rounded smooth aggregates having a spongy or porous exterior'

although our predecessor court later recognized that` there is nothing intrinsically wrong with' using functional_language in claims it noted that in some instances use of functional_language can fail` to provide a clear-cut indication of the scope of subject_matter embraced by the claim' and thus can be indefinite
swinehart 439 f.2d at 212-13 holding that the term` transparent' was definite because the disclosure which showed that a substantial amount of infrared radiation was always transmitted even though the precise degree of transparency varied depending on certain factors was sufficiently clear

when a claim_limitation is defined in purely functional terms the task of determining whether that limitation is sufficiently definite is a difficult one that is highly dependent on context e.g. the disclosure in the specification and the knowledge of a person of ordinary_skill in the relevant_art_area
we note that the patent_drafter is in the best position to resolve the ambiguity in the patent_claims and it is highly desirable that patent examiners demand that applicants do so in appropriate circumstances so that the patent can be amended during prosecution rather than attempting to resolve the ambiguity in litigation

a patent_drafter could resolve the ambiguities of a functional limitation in a number of ways.6 for example the ambiguity might be resolved by using a quantitative *1256 metric e.g. numeric_limitation as to a physical_property rather than a qualitative functional feature
the claim_term might also be sufficiently definite if the specification provided a formula for calculating a property along with examples that meet the claim_limitation and examples that do not
see oakley inc. v. sunglass hut int l 316_f.3d_1331 1341 fed.cir.2003 holding that at the preliminary injunction stage the accused infringer had not shown a substantial question of indefiniteness where the claims and specification linked the claim_term` vivid colored appearance' to a calculation for differential effect and then provided examples of when differential effect values were and were not sufficient for a` vivid colored appearance' ; see also in re marosi 710_f.2d_799 803 fed.cir.1983 finding claims definite where the applicants disclosure provided` a general guideline and examples sufficient' to teach an artisan when the claim_limitation was satisfied7

in this case halliburton differentiated its invention from the prior_art because it was a` fragile_gel'
as discussed above halliburtons proposed definition of that term is not sufficiently definite because it does not adequately distinguish the fragileness of the invention from disclosed prior_art it is ambiguous as to whether an upper_bound of fragileness is contemplated and it is ambiguous as to its requisite ability to suspend drill_cuttings
in other_words halliburtons proposed construction of` fragile_gel' as used in the claims of the ¡¬832_patent is indefinite because it is ambiguous as to the requisite degree of the fragileness of the gel the ability of the gel to suspend drill_cuttings i.e. gel strength and/or some combination of the two
we discern no other construction that can properly be adopted that would render the claims definite

thus we hold that m-i did provide clear and convincing_evidence that the term` fragile_gel' was indefinite and that the district_court correctly held the claims invalid on that basis

iii
for these reasons the district_courts grant of summary_judgment of invalidity for indefiniteness is

1
halliburton conceded at oral_argument that it does not rely on figure 4 to support its assertion that the term` fragile_gel' is definite
as such we need not address that figure directly but note only that there is no observable distinction between the relaxation rates i.e. how quickly fluids return to gel-like_state once stress is removed of at least one of the sf prior_art fluids and the fluids of the invention of the ¡¬ 832 patent
2
at oral_argument halliburton asserted that the district_court erred in finding that the asserted dependent_claims stood or fell with the independent_claims as to their definiteness
on appeal halliburton raised this issue only in a single sentence in the summary of the argument section of its opening brief which did not identify the dependent_claims at issue and provided no basis for finding them definite if the independent_claims are indefinite
following argument halliburton by letter identified the dependent_claims at issue at the time of the district_courts summary_judgment ruling
nevertheless halliburton has presented nothing on appeal to show that this issue i.e. whether additional limitations in the dependent_claims rendered them sufficiently definite was raised before the district_court
because halliburton has inadequately presented this issue on appeal and failed to show it was presented below so as to preserve the issue for appeal we deem this argument waived
smithkline beecham corp. v. apotex corp. 439_f.3d_1312 1320 fed.cir.2006` [ m ] ere statements of disagreement with the district_court as to the existence of factual disputes do not amount to a developed argument'
( citations omitted ; see also united_states v. dunkel 927_f.2d_955 956 7th cir.1991` a skeletalargument really nothing more than an assertion does not preserve a claim..

halliburton also argues that other advantages of the invention provide other objective ways to delineate the scope of` fragile_gel' such as lack of sag problems or lack of appreciable_pressure_spikes when the fragile_gel drilling_fluid transitions easily from a liquid to a gel and back again
¡¬832_patent col.2 ii.42-51
while these are disclosed as benefits of the invention it is unclear how they provide an objective way of determining the scope of the claims
for example one of the named inventors don siems testified that to determine whether there were appreciable_pressure_spikes a competitor would have to compare his prior experience with other prior_art_fluids to his experience with fluids of the ¡¬832_patent
he also testified that pressure measurements in pressure-while-drilling_equipment can depend on factors other than the drilling_fluid such as the size of the hole and type of formation
j.a
1323-24
thus it appears that these considerations sag and pressure spikes are as ambiguous as figure 3 on which halliburton primarily relies
additionally these limitations both appear in dependent_claims
claims 11 49 87` no appreciable pressure spike is observed by pressure-while-drilling_equipment when said drilling is resumed' ; claims 19 57 94 127` said fluid does not exhibit sag when at rest'
under the doctrine of claim_differentiation` the presence of a dependent claim that adds a particular limitation gives rise to a presumption that the limitation in question is not present in the independent claim'
phillips v. awh corp. 415_f.3d_1303 1315 fed.cir.2005 en banc
while claim_differentiation is a presumption that can be rebutted andersen corp. v. fiber composites llc 474_f.3d_1361 1370 fed.cir.2007 halliburtons argument that the presumption is rebutted in this case is unpersuasive

additionally by failing to identify the precise composition of the fluids of the invention halliburtons proposed definition would allow the claims to cover fluids with added components beyond the four prior_art base elements when use of the additional components results in the same degree of fragility as the fluids of the ¡¬832_patent even though halliburton never contemplated such compositions

of course a claim may contain a limitation that includes no explicit upper_bound at all e.g. a claim_limitation that requires` at least 5 %' of an element
since such a limitation does not contemplate an upper_bound beyond what is practically required e.g. the total percentage must be less than 100 % the limitation may not present definiteness concerns
see exxon_research 265 f.3d at 1382 holding that a claim_limitation that average particle diameter be greater than 5 was not indefinite where no upper limit on particle size was given
however when a limitation is ambiguous as to the presence or absence of an upper_bound an inquiry into the definiteness of that limitation is warranted

although not determinative on the definiteness issue it seems clear that the patent_drafter could have provided more specifics in this case either with quantitative metrics as to how quickly the gel must break time to break at given conditions and how strong the gel must be strength at given conditions or with sufficient examples of fragile_gels of the invention to show which such fluids fell within the scope of the claims
exxon_research 265 f.3d at 1376 stating that the patent was lacking in` specificity that in some instances would have been easy to provide and would have largely obviated the need to address the issue of indefiniteness' but holding that the flaws ultimately were not` fatal'

of course in the 1952 patent act congress authorized functional_claiming but with limits in 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?

for so-called means-plus-function limitations claim_scope is limited to structure disclosed in the specification and equivalents
and if no structure is disclosed the claim is indefinite
biomedino 490 f.3d at 950
this statutory provision was meant to preclude the overbreadth inherent in open-ended functional claims such as those presented in this case which effectively purport to cover any and all means so long as they perform the recited functions
