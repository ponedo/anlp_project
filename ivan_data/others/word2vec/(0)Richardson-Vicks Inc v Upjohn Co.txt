opinion
plager circuit_judge
in this case a jury found the patent on a popular cough and cold_formula not invalid for obviousness and not unenforceable
subsequently the trial_judge overturned the jury_verdict
plaintiff appeals the trial_judges action
because the trial_judge acted within the scope of her authority in granting judgment as a matter of law` jmol' and on all the facts of record reached the correct conclusion of invalidity for obviousness the judgment is affirmed

i
background
plaintiff richardson-vicks_inc.` rvi' is the assignee of reexamination certificate b1 4,552,899` the899_patent`
the patent is addressed to an over-the-counter` otc' medicine that combines in various ratios two well-known ingredients the analgesic ibuprofen and the decongestant pseudoephedrine
the combination is sold for the relief of cough cold and flu_symptoms

claims 36 37 47 and 48 were asserted at trial
claim 36 is a composition-of-matter_claim which recites a 1.5 1_to_81 dose ratio range of ibuprofen to pseudoephedrine
claim 37 also a composition-of-matter_claim which depends from claim 36 requires 200 mg of ibuprofen and 30 mg of pseudoephedrine
claims 47_and_48 are method-of-use claims which correspond respectively to claims 36_and_37
the claims each require that the ibuprofen and pseudoephedrine be present in a` combinatory_immixture' which the trial_judge understood to mean in a single_unit_dosage such as a single_tablet or capsule

defendants market otc medicines-motrin_ib_sinusthe_r and sine-aid ib sinusthe_r - *1478 which contain the same ingredients in similar ratios
at the close of evidence the trial_court pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure 50 found as a matter of law that defendants accused products infringed the asserted claims of the899_patent
that finding is not at issue so the only questions on appeal relate to the validity and enforceability of the patent

the original_patent_application was filed on april_9,_1984 and the patent issued on november 12 1985
in 1990 rvi requested reexamination of the patent in light of certain japanese publications
independently mcneil-ppc inc.` mcneil' which is owned by johnson & johnson requested reexamination citing additional prior_art not considered by the examiner in issuing the original patent
both requests were granted by the united states patent and trademark office` pto' on the ground that as required by statute each raised` a substantial new question of patentability'
see 35 u.s.c.¡± 303 1994
subsequently the two reexaminations were merged into a single reexamination proceeding pursuant to 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.565 c
a reexamination certificate was ultimately issued on october 20 1992
in 1993 rvi filed a complaint in the united_states_district_court of delaware charging upjohn mcneil and johnson & johnson collectively` defendants' with infringement of claims 36-big_token__37_and_47__big_token -48 of the899_patent
defendants denied liability and counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment that the patent is invalid not infringed and that intervening rights bar recovery

defendants later moved for summary judgment that the asserted claims are invalid due to prior_invention of a third_party that the claims are invalid because they are anticipated or obvious and that the claims are unenforceable because of patent_misuse arguing that rvi had impermissibly expanded the physical and temporal scope of the899_patent with anti-competitive effect
the trial_court denied all of these motions

the case proceeded to trial
as noted above the trial_judge granted rvis motion for judgment of infringement as a matter of law
the questions of validity and enforceability however were left to the jury
by verdict rendered may_10,_1995 the jury found inter alia that the defendants had failed to prove that the claims were invalid for obviousness or prior_invention or that rvi had impermissibly broadened the scope of the899_patent so as to constitute patent_misuse
the jury then awarded rvi a reasonable royalty of seven percent of the infringing sales

following the adverse verdict defendants renewed their motion for jmol under fed.r.civ.p
50 b or in the alternative for a new_trial under fed.r.civ.p
59
the trial_court concluded that there was` no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to have found for plaintiff on the issues of obviousness and prior_invention'
accordingly the judge granted the defendants renewed motion for jmol on both counts
in the alternative the court conditionally granted the defendants motion for a new_trial on the issue of obviousness should its judgment be overturned on appeal but denied the motion for a new_trial on the issue of prior_invention
the trial_court also awarded defendants intervening rights in the event that the jmol was overturned on appeal
in view of our upholding on the ground of obviousness the trial_courts judgment of invalidity we need not address any of the other questions raised by the appeal
ii
discussion
a
standard of review
rvi states the general rule that in reviewing a jurys verdict on a motion for jmol the question before the trial_court is whether the jury_verdict is supported by substantial_evidence
that of course refers to whether the factual_findings of the jury expressed or implied in the verdict are supported by substantial_evidence in the record
rvi argues that on appeal of the grant of jmol the appellate_court applies the same standard anew without deference to the trial_courts judgment in the matter citing orthokinetics *1479 inc. v. safety travel chairs inc. 806_f.2d_1565 1_uspq2d_1081_(fed.cir.1986) so that its burden in this case is only to show that the jury_verdicts are supported by substantial_evidence
brief for plaintiff at 31

the difficulty with rvis position is that although the argument has merit when the issue is purely one of fact it does not follow when the issue involves a question of law
it is black letter law that the ultimate question of obviousness is a question of law
see graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 17 86_s.ct._684 693-94 15_l.ed.2d_545 148_uspq_459 467 1966 citing great a

and we review that legal question without deference to the trial_court
see gardner v. tec sys. inc. 725_f.2d_1338 1344 220_uspq_777 782 fed.cir.1984 district_courts conclusion on obviousness` is one of law and subject to full and independent review in this court'

at the same time it is well understood that there are factual issues underlying the ultimate obviousness decision
see graham 383 u.s. at 17-18 86 s.ct.at 694 148 uspq at 467
these so-called graham_factors include 1 the scope and content of the prior_art ; 2 the differences between the claimed invention and the prior_art ; 3 the level of ordinary_skill in the art ; and 4 certain secondary_considerations
id
that an obviousness_determination stands upon the relevant facts of the case does not convert the ultimate_conclusion of obviousness from one of law into one of fact

in analyzing the correctness of a jmol overturning a jury_verdict we must consider the facts before the trial_court and then determine whether the trial_courts ultimate_judgment on obviousness is correct as a matter of law
determining the facts and how they bore on the jurys view of the case is made considerably more problematic when as in the case before us the only information we have about the jurys views are contained in a general verdict.1

nevertheless in re-creating the facts as they may have been found by the jury and in applying the graham_factors to the case we assess the record evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict winner in this case rvi newell co. v. kenney mfg co. 864_f.2d_757 765 9_uspq2d_1417 1423 fed.cir.1988` judges must accept the factual_findings presumed from a favorable jury_verdict which are supported under the substantial_evidence/reasonable juror standard
`` though this does not mean that we are free to abdicate our role as the ultimate decision maker on the question of obviousness
that decision remains within our province
see structural rubber prod co. v. park rubber co. 749_f.2d_707 718-19 223_uspq_1264 1273 fed.cir.1984` it is the duty of the appellate_court to be satisfied that the law has been correctly applied to the facts regardless of whether the facts were determined by judge or jury'

*1480 b. obviousness
claim 36 which is representative of the other independent claim reads a pharmaceutical composition of matter for use in the treatment management or mitigation of the pain component of cough cold cold-like and/or flu_symptoms in a mammalian organism said composition comprising [ ] a sympathomimetically analgesically and anti-inflammatorily effective amount ranging from 25 mg to 600 mg of ibuprofen or pharmaceutically acceptable_salt thereof in combinatory_immixture with 5 mg to 120 mg of pseudoephedrine or pharmaceutically acceptable_salt thereof and
wherein the ratio by weight of said nsaid i to said sympathomimetic_amine ii ranges from about 1.5:1 to about 8:1
thus claim 36 defines a cough and cold_medication comprising two ingredients-ibuprofen and pseudoephedrine-in` combinatory_immixture'
( as earlier noted claim 37 which depends from claim 36 further limits the amount of ibuprofen to 200 mg and to 30 mg of pseudoephedrine ; claim 48 claims a method of treating cough and cold_symptoms using the claimed combination of claim 36 while claim 49 is a similar method claim incorporating claim 37
the question then is whether this composition would have been obvious in view of the prior_art
since the patentee rvi does not argue the validity of the dependent claims separately their validity will stand or fall with independent claim 36
see stratoflex inc. v. aeroquip corp. 713_f.2d_1530 1536 218_uspq_871 877 fed.cir.1983

the trial_court reviewed the claims the written description and the prosecution history and concluded that the phrase` combinatory_immixture' required` the two ingredients in a single_form such as a tablet or elixir'
neither party seriously disputes this definition
having conducted a similar review of the evidence relevant to claim construction we find no error in this definition and adopt it as our own

the obviousness issue therefore boils down to whether one of ordinary_skill in the art would have combined the two ingredients into a single_form
we must therefore consider the four graham_factors interpreted in light of the jury_verdict
in doing so we remain cognizant of the statutory presumption of validity 35 u.s.c.¡± 282 as well as that` the facts to support a conclusion of invalidity must be proven by clear and convincing_evidence' ryko mfg co. v. nu-star inc. 950_f.2d_714 716 21_uspq2d_1053 1055 fed.cir.1991

scope and content of the prior_art the obviousness of a patent claim is determined` at the time the invention was made'
35 u.s.c.¡± 103
april_9,_1984 is the date the original_patent_application was filed
the trial_court considered and rejected an earlier date of conception by the inventors drs
sunshine laska and siegel
rvi does not now challenge that finding
accordingly the relevant_prior_art is that art existing prior to april_9,_1984 the date of constructive reduction to practice of the invention

there is no dispute about the scope and content of the prior_art
the most relevant_prior_art includes two cough and cold_formulations
the first is a combination of acetaminophen and pseudoephedrine sold as a single_unit_dosage under the brand name co-tylenolthe_r
pseudoephedrine was also combined with aspirin in a unit dosage for treating cough and cold_symptoms
the combination of an analgesic aspirin or acetaminophen and a decongestant pseudoephedrine was known to be particularly effective for treating sinus_headaches because both drugs help to alleviate the associated pain
the analgesic operated in the normal manner to relieve pain while the decongestant relieved pain by reducing swelling and congestion on the sensitive membranes in the area of the sinuses
doctors had been taught in medical school to treat sinus_headaches by prescribing both analgesics and decongestants together
in this case there was evidence that doctors had in fact prescribed ibuprofen in combination with pseudoephedrine albeit not in a` combinatory_immixture'

*1481 differences between the claimed invention and the prior_art the difference between the other single_unit_dosage cough and cold products such as co-tylenol and the claimed invention is that the former used a different analgesic i.e. acetaminophen than the claimed invention
thus the` combinatory_immixture' included one but not both of the ingredients specified in the patent
the difference between the doctor prescribed combinations and the claimed invention is that the doctors prescriptions assumed that the named analgesic ibuprofen and the pseudoephedrine would be in physically separate tablets
thus the prescribed medications were not in` combinatory_immixture' as that phrase in the patent is defined

level of ordinary skill in the art the parties do not dispute the level of ordinary_skill
defendants assert that one of ordinary_skill in the art is a person with an m.d
or ph.d. citing to a paper filed by rvi with the pto asserting this to be the required level of skill
rvi does not challenge this assertion
there is therefore no dispute as to the level of skill in the art

evidence of secondary considerations rvi relies heavily on evidence of secondary_factors to overcome the strong showing of the prior_art
primary among that evidence is the results of so-called` synergy' between the ibuprofen and the pseudoephedrine
by that rvi means that the` analgesic and anti-inflammatory response' of the combinatory_immixture is greater than what would be predicted based on the two ingredients separately
to prove this claim rvi commissioned a test by an independent testing laboratory
the laboratory conducted tests on mice to measure their response to pain stimuli
a first group of mice was administered ibuprofen and a control_group received a placebo
both were subjected to a pain_stimulus
the responses of the treated mice were then compared to the responses of the mice in the control_group i.e. those without ibuprofen
a mouse in the treated group was said to be protected if its pain was less than half of the mean value of the pain responses of the mice in the control_group
based on this data a dosage was statistically determined that is the amount of ibuprofen that is expected to protect 50 % of a group of mice subjected to the same pain stimuli
this dosage is referred to as the` effective dosage for 50 %' or` ed50' for ibuprofen this procedure was then repeated for pseudoephedrine to produce the ed50 for pseudoephedrine
a two dimensional chart was then constructed with the ed50 for ibuprofen as a data_point on the y-axis and the ed50 for pseudoephedrine as a data_point on the x-axis
a line connecting these two data_points called the` line of additivity' was then constructed which represented the ed50 for various combinations of these two components

a combination dose lying on the line of additivity was then chosen
this dosage was then administered to a group of mice in a test group who were then challenged by a pain_stimulus
the responses of this group were then compared to a control_group
the combination dosage of a ratio of ibuprofen to pseudoephedrine of 7:1 lying on the line of additivity protected 80 % of the mice tested instead of the 50 % predicted by the line of additivity
this was a statistically significant result according to the inventors because it demonstrated that the combination produced greater_pain_relief than that dictated by the pain relief properties of the two drugs individually
in other words the two drugs produced a` synergistic' effect

during reexamination the pto gave significant weight to the test_results
initially the examiner rejected the claims on the ground of obviousness the issue that the examiner considers central to the ultimate_issue of patentability is whether or not aspirin and any one of the claimed propionic_acid_nsaids would have been reasonably expected by a person of ordinary_skill in this art to be interchangeable in a cough/cold combination containing a sympathomimetic_amine decongestant
the patent owner maintains that the skilled artisan would have not considered *1482 aspirin and the propionic_acid_nsaids interchangeable in cough/cold preparations containing a sympathomimetic_amine
the examiner however can not concur
paper no._18 dated february 18 1992
the examiner confirmed his rejection under ¡± 103 in an` advisory_action'
see manual of patent examining procedure ¡± 714.13 at 700-68 6th ed.1995
although the test_results were before the examiner when he issued the advisory_action they were deemed not to rebut the prima_facie_case of obviousness because the test_results were not` commensurate in scope with the claimed subject_matter'
in response the patentees drafted a complete new set of claims 39-68 that were` commensurate in scope' with the test_results
the examiner allowed these new claims over the prior_art
the examiner explained his change of mind this conclusion is supported by the declarations filed under 37_cfr_1132 and the data submitted therewith on january 14 1992 and april_22,_1992 which establish that when certain propionic acid nsaid ingredients are combined with certain sympathomimetic_amine ingredients in a specific range of proportions an unexpectedly superior degree of pain relief results
the prior_art fails to teach or suggest such results and the claims are commensurate in scope with the evidence submitted
thus the claims are deemed to be patentable over the cited prior_art
thus the examiner placed singular reliance on the evidence of synergy to allow the claims

rvi also put on evidence of commercial_success
the proffered evidence included annual sales of the patented product of some $ 48 million with gross profit margins of between 67 % and 79 % within three years of the products introduction
there was also evidence to show that the growth of the claimed ibuprofen/pseudoephedrine product has been in excess of 30 % per year since its introduction while during the same period the overall otc market has grown at only 10 % per year

rvi also put on evidence of` skepticism' by others concerning the invention
drs
murcek and brooks testified that combining ibuprofen and pseudoephedrine into a single_tablet having a fixed ratio would be` illogical' and` impossible' to use in a clinical setting
although both prescribed ibuprofen and pseudoephedrine together neither had combined them into a single_unit_dosage
the reason they gave in their testimony was that their practices require flexibility in treating patients which requires them to prescribe the two drugs in varying ratios
as one of the doctors stated` [ t ] he ratio could be as low as one to five or as high as one to thirty'

rvi also suggests that the prior_art` teaches away' from the claimed invention and put on evidence to support this
in particular rvi produced scientific evidence that ibuprofen actually causes congestion
therefore according to rvi it would be illogical to use ibuprofen in a formula intended to reduce congestion such as a cough and cold_formula

even though the evidence of unexpected_results based on the mice experiments was dispositive in the pto it was considered` irrelevant' by the trial_court because` the alleged synergistic property of the patented combination was unknown at the time of dr. sunshines invention' and` several other otc ibuprofen manufacturers similarly arrived at the claimed invention without knowledge of any synergy'
in rejecting the evidence of unexpected_results the trial_court quoted from and apparently relied on in re_soni 54_f.3d_746 34_uspq2d_1684_(fed.cir.1995) for support
the trial_court then went on to decide the ultimate_issue of obviousness` without regard to any evidence of synergy'
on appeal defendants` do not dispute rvis contention that synergy was proved for the claimed combination'

as with the evidence of unexpected_results the trial_court also discounted the evidence of commercial_success
quoting from *1483 kansas_jack inc. v. kuhn 719_f.2d_1144 219_uspq_857_(fed.cir.1983) the trial_court concluded that the` evidence of commercial_success proffered by plaintiff is limited to sales data and does not include evidence ofmarket_share of growth in market_share of replacing earlier units sold by others or of dollar amounts and no evidence of a nexus between the sales and the merits of the invention
``

in discounting the evidence of unexpected_results the trial_court read more into in re_soni than is there
indeed in that case the court reiterated the well-established rule that` all evidence of nonobviousness must be considered when assessing patentability' and further that` the pto must consider comparative data in the specification in determining whether the claimed invention provides unexpected_results'
in re_soni 54 f.3d at 750 34 uspq2d at 1687 emphasis added

rather than permit a court to ignore evidence of unexpected_results in re_soni makes clear that such_evidence must be considered in evaluating the obviousness of a claimed invention
in arriving at its judgment regarding whether the claimed invention would have been obvious the trial_court should have given appropriate weight to the evidence of unexpected_results
see stratoflex 713 f.2d at 1538 218 uspq at 879` it is jurisprudentially inappropriate to disregard any relevant evidence on any issue in any case patent_cases included
thus evidence arising out of the so-calledsecondary_considerations must always when present be considered en route to a determination of obviousness
`` ; in re_soni 54 f.3d at 750 34 uspq2d at 1687 ; in re chu 66_f.3d_292 298 36_uspq2d_1089 1094 fed.cir.1995 ; in re oetiker 977_f.2d_1443 1445 24_uspq2d_1443 1444 fed.cir.1992 ; in re piasecki 745_f.2d_1468 1471-72 223_uspq_785 787 fed.cir.1984` all evidence on the question of obviousness must be considered both that supporting and that rebutting the prima_facie_case'
this proposition holds not only in ex parte proceedings before the pto but also in inter partes proceedings in the district_courts
see lindemann maschinenfabrik gmbh v. american hoist and derrick co. 730_f.2d_1452 1462 221_uspq_481 488 fed.cir.1984 error for district_court to ignore evidence of unexpected_results in deciding obviousness ; kansas_jack 719 f.2d at 1150 219 uspq at 861` all evidence touching the obvious-nonobvious issue [ must ] be considered before a conclusion is reached on the issue'

this does not necessarily mean that the trial_courts ultimate_judgment was incorrect
evidence of secondary_considerations including evidence of unexpected_results and commercial_success are but a part of the` totality of the evidence' that is used to reach the ultimate_conclusion of obviousness
kansas_jack 719 f.2d at 1151 219 uspq at 862
in some cases such_evidence is the most probative of obviousness
see e.g. stratoflex 713 f.2d at 1538 218 uspq at 879
the existence of such_evidence however does not control the obviousness_determination
see newell 864 f.2d at 768 9 uspq2d at 1426` first as indicated obviousness is not a factual inference ; second although these factors must be considered they do not control the obviousness conclusion'
( citations omitted ; ryko 950 f.2d at 719 21 uspq2d at 1058 the weight of secondary_considerations may be of insufficient weight to override a determination of obviousness based on primary considerations
therefore we must consider all of the evidence under the graham_factors before reaching our decision

in this case we agree with the trial_court that when all the factors are considered the claims would have been obvious to one of ordinary_skill in the art
the prior_art_combinations of an analgesic aspirin or acetaminophen and a decongestant pseudoephedrine in a single_unit_dosage were known to be particularly effective for treating sinus_headaches because both drugs help to alleviate the associated pain
ibuprofen was a known analgesic that was interchangeable with either aspirin or acetaminophen
moreover ibuprofen was prescribed in combination with pseudoephedrine by the doctors who testified
the only difference between *1484 the prescribed combination and the patented_invention is that the prescription was not contained in a single_tablet
such a combination was clearly suggested by the prior_art including co-tylenolthe_r which combined an analgesic with pseudoephedrine into a single_tablet
in fact it was so combined by a third_party ahp in october of 1983 prior to the date of invention.2 the unexpected_results and commercial_success of the claimed invention although supported by substantial_evidence do not overcome the clear and convincing_evidence that the subject_matter sought to be patented is obvious

there also exists another fact that created a strong motivation to combine the two ingredients into a single_unit_dosage i.e. in` combinatory_immixture'
in 1983 numerous prior_art publications announced that the food and drug administration` fda' would approve ibuprofen as an over-the-counter medicine subject to voluntary compliance with certain advertising restrictions
see` low-dose ibuprofen may enter otc analgesic market' medical world news at 14-5 sept._26,_1983
those publications indicated that the fda would likely approve dosages in the range of 200_to_400 mg precisely within the range of the claimed invention
the otc industry anticipated that ibuprofen would quickly begin displacing acetaminophen and aspirin as the preferred analgesic because ibuprofen was known to be as or more effective a pain reliever and also produced` fewer gastrointestinal effects than aspirin'
id
the motivation to substitute ibuprofen for either acetaminophen or aspirin in the prior_art` combinatory_immixtures' to produce the claimed combination would have been particularly strong for the ibuprofen manufacturers because it allows them to strengthen the name brand recognition through so-called` line_extensions'
these line_extensions allow the ibuprofen manufactures to use their brand names under which ibuprofen is sold e.g. motrin ibthe_r in other products e.g. motrin_ib_sinusthe_r and thereby increase the name recognition of the underlying ibuprofen product

the evidence of commercial_success is equally unpersuasive
even if we infer that the jury found that the claimed invention was a` commercial_success' this evidence does not convince us that the invention was not obvious
the advantages of ibuprofen were well known by doctors and patients alike
those advantages included reduced gastrointestinal side effects and greater_pain_relief than aspirin
it is not surprising then that the claimed invention was highly successful and may have displaced the prior_art_combinations because consumers preferred ibuprofen to aspirin or acetaminophen

the fact that doctors wanted greater flexibility in prescribing this combination does not teach away from the claimed combination
it merely recognizes that doctors must treat a variety of differently situated patients including children and adults
the otc market in contrast aims at a much broader market
as a result the dosages are much lower than available by prescription because they must be safe for all consumers within a broad_class such as all adults
doctors on the other hand might prescribe different dosages based on a variety of other factors including the severity of the condition the weight of the patient etc. even though each patient is a member of the broad_class
rvis other evidence of secondary_factors is equally unpersuasive.3

sorting through the record in a case such as this when the issue is the correctness of a *1485 jury_verdict is made considerably more difficult by the absence of specific findings by the jury
the effort by the successful plaintiff to support the jury_verdict in its favor is also made more difficult
the preferred route would have been to submit the underlying factual issues to the jury in the form of a special_verdict under rule 49 a
that rule provides a special verdicts
the court may require a jury to return only a special_verdict in the form of a special written finding upon each issue of fact
in that event the court may submit to the jury written questions susceptible of categorical or other brief answer or may submit written forms of the several special findings which might be made under the pleadings and evidence ; or it may use such other method of submitting the issues and requiring the written findings thereon as it deems most appropriate
the court shall give to the jury such explanation and instruction concerning the matter thus submitted as may be necessary to enable the jury to make its findings upon each issue.. fed.r.civ.p
49 a
the reasons for using this procedural_device are obvious and well documented in all areas of the law
for example one noted scholar long ago described the benefits as follows the special_verdict compels detailed consideration
but above all it enables the public the parties and the court to see what the jury really has done
the general verdict is either all wrong or all right because it is inseparable and inscrutable
a single error completely destroys it
but the special_verdict enables errors to be localized so that the sound portions of the verdict may be saved and only the unsound portions be subject to redeterminations through a new_trial

49.02 2d ed.1996 discussing problems associated with general verdicts
given the nuances of patent law combined with the added complications of technology the advantages of a special fact verdict are even more pronounced
this court early made the point that` [ t ] he utilization of rule 49 a appears to us as a particularly useful tool in conserving judicial resources and in effectuating the congressional policy expressed in the patent laws'
structural rubber 749 f.2d at 724 223 uspq at 1277
the supreme court recently emphasized that patent_cases are particularly well suited for special_verdicts
see warner-jenkinson co. v. hilton davis chem co. -- -u.s. -- -- -- -- n. 8 117_s.ct._1040 1053_n._8 137_l.ed.2d_146 41_uspq2d_1865 1875_n._8_(1997)` [ i ] n cases that reach the jury a special_verdict and/or interrogatories on each claim element could be very useful in facilitating review uniformity and possibly post-verdict judgments as a matter of law`
in many cases counsel would be well advised to request special_verdicts and in any event trial_judges may exercise their broad authority over their trials by utilizing this procedural_device

defendants allege that this october 1983 combination renders the claims invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 g because the invention was` invented by another'
this issue was submitted to the jury and the jury found that although ahp conceived of their invention on october 1983 by manufacturing 30,000 tablets of the claimed drug they did not actually reduce this invention to practice until august 1985 after the clinical testing had been completed
defendants ask us to reverse this finding on the grounds that as a matter of law ahp reduced its invention to practice in october 1983 when it manufactured the drug
we need not reach this issue given our holding that the claims are invalid under ¡± 103

rvi puts great emphasis on the following statement in an upjohn advertisement will somebody please put the two [ ibuprofen and pseudoephedrine ] into one combination formula that will make my sinus pain and congestion go far far away ?
this advertisement according to rvi represents` industry acclaim' of the patented_invention that constitutes` strong objective evidence of nonobviousness'
we fail to appreciate the significance of this statement which is intended to generate interest in the product not prove its superiority
