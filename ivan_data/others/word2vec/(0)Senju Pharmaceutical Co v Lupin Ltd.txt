introduction
the invention at issue relates to gatifloxacin an aqueous_liquid_pharmaceutical_eye_drop_composition with added disodium edetate` edta'
seven prior_art_patents are alleged as the basis for the obviousness_determination each containing some of the same_chemistry as the claimed invention
in addition there are several prior patent infringement suits involving the same_chemistry and the same ¡¬045_patent ; these suits are relevant though to some extent the issues and parties vary
three of these infringement suits including this one have all been tried before and decided by the same district judge in the district of delaware

the underlying issues in this case-constructive infringement under hatch-waxman countered by alleged non-infringement and invalidity for obviousness-are familiar patent issues
yet the combination of the chemistry and the prior_litigation has produced here a complex of arguments by both parties
we address below in detail only those arguments that we believe have saliency with regard to the outcome

regarding the prior law suits the first began in 2007
pursuant to the hatch-waxman_act a manufacturer of generic drugs apotex_inc. and apotex corp.` apotex' filed an abbreviated new drug application` anda' with the food and drug administration` fda' seeking to market generic versions of allergans gatifloxacin product zymarthe_r
the patent on zymarthe_r was listed in the fdas record of approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence what is known as the` orange book'

in this first suit the district_court in 2010 ruled that the asserted claims were infringed but that claims 1-big_token__3_and_6__big_token -9 were invalid as obvious over the prior_art
however the court found that defendant apotex failed to demonstrate that claims 6_and_7 were invalid for lack of enablement and failed to demonstrate inequitable conduct
senju_pharm co. v. apotex_inc. 717_f.supp.2d_404 433 d.del.2010` apotex 1`

following a motion for a new trial or alternatively to amend judgment and findings regarding claim 7 the court reopened the case to consider additional evidence regarding claim 7
thereafter the court in 2011 found claim 7 obvious by clear and convincing_evidence
senju_pharm co. v. apotex_inc. 836_f.supp.2d_196 210-11 d.del.2011` apotex 2`
on appeal of the judgment regarding claim 7 this court affirmed the judgment of invalidity in a summary affirmance senju_pharm co. v. apotex_inc. 485_fed.appx._433_(fed.cir.2012)` apotex i` ; the other parts of the district judges rulings were not appealed

meanwhile in february 2011 before final judgment was entered in that litigation the senju plaintiffs petitioned the patent and trademark office` pto' for ex-parte re-examination of the ¡¬045_patent
plaintiffs submitted the prior_art the arguments relied upon by the court and parties and the courts opinion
however plaintiffs did not notify either the defendants or the court that they were seeking re-examination ; it was not until shortly *1340 before the re-examination was completed that the trial court was informed

on initial reexamination the pto agreed with the district_court that the original claims would have been obvious in light of the cited prior_art_patents
subsequently in october 2011 the pto issued a reexamination certificate for the ¡¬045_patent which cancelled claims 1-big_token__3_and_8__big_token -11 allowed amended claim 6 and added claims 1216

then plaintiff senju filed another suit against apotex alleging infringement of the reexamined_claims and seeking a declaratory_judgment of infringement based on the same anda filing at issue in the first litigation
apotex responded to the new action by seeking dismissal on the grounds of res judicata or claim_preclusion` claim' here referring to the civil procedure concept not the patent law meaning

ultimately the district_court sided with apotex and gave judgment against senju on the grounds of claim_preclusion` the reexamination of the patent-at-issue did not create a new cause of action against the same previous defendants and accused product'
senju_pharm co. v. apotex_inc. 891_f.supp.2d_656 662 d.del.2012` apotex 3`
on appeal this judgment was upheld in an extensive opinion by the federal_circuit senju_pharm co. v. apotex_inc. 746_f.3d_1344_(fed.cir.2014)` apotex ii`

while all this was going on senju in 2011 filed the suit at issue here against the lupin and hi-tech_defendants asserting infringement under the hatch-waxman_act of the ¡¬045_patent2 as in the second suit against apotex senju specifically alleged infringement of the reexamined_claims 6_and_12 -16 this time based on lupins earlier-filed anda nos._202-653 0.5 w/v %_gatifloxacin and 202-709 0.3 w/v %_gatifloxacin as well as hi-techs anda nos._203189 0.5 w/v %_gatifloxacin and 203190 0.3 w/v %_gatifloxacin
the lupin and hi-tech_defendants had sought fda approval to market and sell generic copies of senjus fda approved gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution

lupin moved for judgment on the pleadings alleging that the narrower reexamined_claims of the ¡¬045_patent were invalid for obviousness and that plaintiffs should be collaterally estopped from relitigating these claims based on the courts findings in apotex 3
the district_court ruled that although lupin might later at trial succeed in showing that the reexamined_claims were invalid for obviousness senju in the apotex 1 & 2 litigations had not fully litigated a claim with a limitation of 0.01 w/v %_edta and therefore collateral estoppel would not apply.big_token__3_j.a._7__big_token

as noted earlier the ¡¬045_patent is directed to aqueous liquid pharmaceutical compositions comprising gatifloxacin and edta as well as various methods utilizing these compositions
the ¡¬045_patents original u.s. filing date is april_21,_2000
the reexamined_claims at issue are 6
a method for raising corneal_permeability of an aqueous_pharmaceutical_gatifloxacin_eye_drop_solution comprising gatifloxacin or its salt having a ph of from above 5 to about 6 containing from about 0.3 to about 0.8 w/v %_gatifloxacin or its salt which comprises incorporating *big_token__1341_about_0__big_token01 w/v %_disodium_edetate into said gatifloxacin_eye_drop_solution
12
an aqueous_liquid_pharmaceutical_eye_drop_composition which comprises from about 0.3 to about 0.8 w/v %_gatifloxacin or its salt about 0.01 w/v %_disodium_edetate and wherein the aqueous liquid pharmaceutical composition has a ph of from about 5 to about 6
13
the aqueous_liquid_pharmaceutical_eye_drop_composition according to claim 12 comprising about 0.3 w/v %_gatifloxacin or its salt
14
the aqueous_liquid_pharmaceutical_eye_drop_composition according to claim 12 comprising about 0.5 w/v %_gatifloxacin or its salt
15
the aqueous_liquid_pharmaceutical_eye_drop_composition according to claim 12 comprising at least one isotonic_agent selected from the group consisting of sodium_chloride potassium chloride glycerin mannitol and glucose
16
the aqueous_liquid_pharmaceutical_eye_drop_composition according to claim 14 wherein the at least one isotonic_agent is sodium_chloride
¡¬045_patent reexamination certificate 1:25-2:24 ; j.a
2702

the district_court having reserved the question of infringement and the validity of the reexamined_claims in light of the prior_art of record proceeded to trial
the courts ultimate judgment was that the reexamined_claims were infringed but were invalid for obviousness
thus the question before us is in this appeal is whether the district_court erred when in the current suit against lupin and hi-tech it concluded that reexamined_claims 6_and_12 -16 of the ¡¬045_patent were invalid for obviousness
we have jurisdiction under 28 u.s.c.¡±¡± 1292 c 2 and 1295 a

discussion
a
standard of review
obviousness is a question of law that we review without deference
pozen inc. v. par pharm. inc. 696_f.3d_1151 1160 fed.cir.2012
following a bench trial we review underlying factual determinations for clear_error
id

an obviousness inquiry assesses` the differences between the subject_matter sought to be patented and the prior_art' to ascertain whether` the subject_matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary_skill in the art to which said subject_matter pertains'
35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a 1994
`` [ a ] patent composed of several elements is not proved obvious merely by demonstrating that each of its elements was independently known in the prior_art'
ksr_int l co. v. teleflex_inc. 550_u.s._398 418 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007)
thus a defendant asserting obviousness in view of a combination of references has the burden to show by clear and convincing_evidence that a person of ordinary_skill in the relevant field had reason to combine the elements in the manner claimed
id.at 418-19 127_s.ct._1727
in addition to showing a reason to combine the elements in the manner claimed a defendant must also demonstrate that a person of ordinary_skill would have a reasonable expectation of success in combining the elements

b
analysis
the senju appellants make two main arguments relating to obviousness 1 the district_court erred by finding that the prior_art taught using 0.01 w/v %_edta in an ophthalmic_formulation would work to increase corneal_permeability ; and 2 the *1342 district_court erred by finding appellants proffer of evidence of unexpected_results unavailing
we will consider each of these arguments in turn

1
obviousness
before addressing the substantive obviousness analysis conducted by the district_court we address senjus arguments regarding the methodology the district_court used in its analysis
first appellants argue that the district_court improperly utilized its obviousness findings from its decision in apotex 1 as the basis from which to begin its invalidity inquiries in this case essentially lessening appellees burden of proving by clear and convincing_evidence that the reexamined_claims asserted in the present_case would have been obvious
appellants argue that the district_courts factual_findings in apotex 1 should have played no role in the invalidity inquiry in this case because the currently asserted reexamined_claims contain new_limitations and disclose only a narrow subset of the original claimed invention commensurate with objective evidence of unexpected_results

appellants argue that the district_court relied upon findings from apotex 1 regarding edta_concentrations and ph range to conclude that the new_limitations in the reexamined_claims do not distinguish the claimed inventions from the prior_art
they argue that the court analyzed the claims in piecemeal fashion violating the requirement in section 103 of the patent act that courts analyze the obviousness of an invention` as a whole'
see 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a

appellants argue that the district_court by this method of analysis effectively applied a presumption of invalidity to the reexamined_claims resulting in the district_courts failure to evaluate the limitations holistically
in effect appellants argue the district_court used the predecessor_claims as prior_art to the present_claims even though such methodology is erroneous as a matter of law
appellant_br
63-64 citing interconnect_planning_corp. v. feil 774_f.2d_1132 1137 fed.cir.1985

appellees respond that appellants pursuit of reexamined_claims 6_and_12 -16 was merely a failed attempt to bypass the district_courts apotex 1 invalidity judgment and prior_art teachings and that appellants can not now claim the district_courts methodology is the reason for their failings
appellees argue that the district_court did not err by declining to repeat the identical reasoning for identical factual_findings that appellants never appealed in apotex 1
appellees note that appellants singular focus at trial was the 0.01 w/v %_edta for corneal_permeability and that appellants never raised the arguments rejected in apotex 1 or new arguments outside this issue
thus appellees argue the district_court properly declined to` find' anew facts appellants did not dispute at trial or those already found and not appealed in apotex 1 because such facts are undisputed
nevertheless appellees point out that the district_court properly made new fact findings specific to the reexamined_claims as a whole even beyond the 0.01 w/v %_edta issue appellants pursued at trial repeating a complete obviousness analysis for each claim appellants asserted and supporting all of its findings with evidence of record from this case

in support of their position that the district_court used the predecessor_claims as prior_art to the present_claims and failed to analyze the reexamined_claims holistically appellants cite interconnect_planning_corp. 774_f.2d_1132
in interconnect we held that the district_court improperly weighed the changes in the reissue_claim against the original claim and failed to consider the differences between *1343 the prior_art and the reissue_claim as a whole
id.at 1137
this case is distinguishable from the present_case
contrary to appellants characterization the district_court in the present_case did not handpick limitations in the reexamined_claims to analyze
instead the district_court focused on appellants own arguments which highlighted key claim limitations that distinguished the reexamined_claims from the prior_art generally

we conclude that the district_court properly considered as a whole all of the limitations in appellants amended and newly-added claims including` using 0.3 w/v % to 0.8 w/v %_gatifloxacin ;' a` ph of above 5 to about 6 ;' and` using 0.01 w/v %_edta' including` to increase corneal_permeability' in the context of the prior_art
specifically the district_court stepped through the disputed claim limitations and pointed out where each is found in the prior_art along with the reasoning for combining the prior_art to reach the disclosure in the asserted claims
see e.g. j.a
25-34

moving on to the conclusion of obviousness by the district_court we address first the obviousness of claims 1216 the composition_claims and then the obviousness of claim 6 a method_claim
the four prior_art_references from the apotex 1 & 2 cases u.s._patent_nos._4551,456` the ¡¬456_patent` 4,780,465` the ¡¬465_patent` and 4,980,470` the ¡¬470_patent` and grass 19854 are again at issue in this case

the earliest of the prior_art_patents the ¡¬456_patent issued on november 5 1985 teaches that then-known quinolones are both` compatible with ocular tissue' and useful in treating bacterial ocular infections through topical administration
¡¬456_patent 1:13-17
the ¡¬456_patent also discloses an exemplary ophthalmic composition that comprises an aqueous solution of 0.3 w/v % norfloxacin and 0.01 w/v %_edta as well as the use of edta as one of 8 conventional_excipients
id.at 2:5-10

the ¡¬465_patent issued on october 25 1988 discloses aqueous compositions for the quinolone_lomefloxacin also characterizing edta as a conventional_excipient
¡¬465_patent 2:31-46
the ¡¬465_patent describes two exemplary ophthalmic compositions similar to the ophthalmic composition disclosed by the ¡¬456_patent containing 0.3 w/v % lomefloxacin and 0.01 w/v %_edta
id.at 4:1-23

the ¡¬470_patent issued on december 25 1990 teaches that gatifloxacin represents an improvement over the prior_art quinolones in that it exhibits a broader antibacterial activity higher selective toxicity and safe oral and parenteral_administration
¡¬470_patent 1:32-61
the ¡¬470_patent also teaches that each of the disclosed quinolones have` similar substituents' id.at 1:41-43 and that pharmaceutical formulations of gatifloxacin follow` the routes well known' with respect to` oral [ ] and parenteral [ ]' administration including` liquids [ and ] eye_drops'
id.at 7:21-26

the grass 1985 reference is directed to the study of edtas impact on the permeability of organic and inorganic compounds with respect to the corneal epithelia
j.a
2707
grass 1985 teaches that edta can reduce the number of calcium ions through chelation thus creating small channels between corneal epithelial cells which allow polar molecules to penetrate through the cornea into the aqueous_humor of the eye
grass 1985 specifically reports that the addition of 0.5 w/v %_edta to separate solutions of glycerol and cromolyn resulted in increased corneal_permeability in both solutions
a lower unspecified concentration *1344 of edta was also shown to function in this manner albeit to a lesser extent

in addition to these four references appellees also raise the grass_1988-i5 grass_1988-ii6 and rojanasakul7 references mainly to address the additional claim limitations in the narrower reexamined_claims
the grass_1988-i and grass_1988-ii references build on the work in grass 1985 collectively` grass_references' testing lower_concentrations of 0.1 0.05 and 0.01 w/v %_edta finding increased corneal_permeability at these lower_concentrations
the rojanasakul_reference is directed to studying the promoting mechanisms of various penetration enhancers including edta in the cornea as well as to developing methods for evaluating tissue damage and viability
j.a
2788
this reference builds further on the teachings of the grass_references by testing edta_concentrations as low as 0.00037 w/v %_edta and finding that even these very low_concentrations increased corneal_permeability to some degree
j.a
2795-96

appellants also raise two additional references the mitra_reference and the kompella_reference as evidence of nonobviousness
the mitra_reference is a comprehensive review of ophthalmic drug delivery systems
j.a
2768-72
the mitra_reference specifically studies the mechanisms of edta for corneal drug penetration examining the concentrations at which increases in permeability of the cornea occur
j.a
2772
the kompella_reference is a peer-reviewed abstract that reinforces the teachings of mitra studying the impact of edta on corneal_permeability
j.a
2810-11

first appellants argue that the seven prior_art_references relied upon by the district_court predate the claimed invention by at least eight years which` is itself evidence of nonobviousness'
appellant_br
25 citing panduit corp. v. dennison mfg co. 810_f.2d_1561 1577 fed.cir.1987
second appellants argue that the district_court misconstrued the teachings of the prior_art
specifically with respect to claims 12-16 appellants argue that a skilled_artisan would not have been motivated to cherry-pick individual limitations from the ¡¬456 ¡¬465 and ¡¬470_patent_s and combine them to achieve the compositions of claims 12-16
appellants argue that the district_court erred in selectively excerpting teachings from these three prior_art_references to reverse-engineer the claimed invention
in its analysis appellants argue the district_court failed to consider whether an ordinary practitioner would have had a reason to make the multiple selections combinations and modifications needed under its analysis to arrive at the claimed compositions

appellants also argue that the district_court improperly declined to consider evidence on corneal_permeability with reference to the composition_claims
appellants point out that corneal_permeability is relevant to these claims because the claimed compositions embody the method *1345 of reexamined_claim 6 and the purpose of the composition and the functions of its limitations can not be divorced from the obviousness inquiry
appellant_reply_br
19 citing leo_pharmaceutical_products ltd. v. rea 726_f.3d_1346 1353 1356 fed.cir.2013
because according to appellants no prior_art disclosed 0.01 w/v %_edta as preferred for the purpose of raising corneal_permeability appellants argue that they did more than merely seek to patent a combination of known ingredients to achieve established functions

appellants argue that the district_court improperly found claims 12-16 obvious without finding that the ¡¬456 ¡¬465 and ¡¬470_patent_s actually teach any gatifloxacin_formulations for ocular administration
appellants argue that the district_court improperly surmised that the ¡¬456_patent teaches that quinolones are useful in treating bacterial infections the ¡¬465_patent teaches that edta is a conventional_excipient for use with the quinolone_lomefloxacin and the ¡¬470_patent teaches that gatifloxacin_formulations can be used in known routes of oral and parenteral_administration including liquid eye_drops

based on these conclusions appellants argue that the district_court then improperly relied on the fact that gatifloxacin is a member of the quinolone family of compounds to combine the ¡¬456 and ¡¬470_patent_s and arrive at the idea of an ophthalmic gatifloxacin solution pulling teachings of gatifloxacin_concentrations and ph from the ¡¬456 and ¡¬465_patent s and 0.01 w/v %_edta from the ¡¬456_patent to arrive at the specific ranges recited in the claims
essentially appellants argue that the district_court selectively excerpted teachings from each of the three prior_art_patents to improperly reverse-engineer the claimed invention
appellants point out that this is improper hindsight bias because the ¡¬456 ¡¬465 and ¡¬470_patent_s themselves do not disclose anything about corneal_permeability of gatifloxacin_solutions and therefore provide no reason to arrive at the claimed compositions
appellants argue that the district_court failed to identify any reasons for a skilled_artisan to combine the prior_art to achieve the claimed invention finding only that a skilled_artisan would have been motivated to use gatifloxacin and edta together and that the claimed ph and edta_concentration limitations are found in the prior_art

appellees respond that with respect to claims 12-16 not only did appellants waive the issue of the years between the publication of the prior_art and the filing date of the ¡¬045_patent_application being` itself evidence of nonobviousness' by raising this issue for the first_time on appeal but also that the panduit case appellants cite in support of their position is not comparable to the current case
appellees point out that in the panduit case there were no prior_art_references at issue that disclosed or suggested all of the claimed structural limitations while in this case several prior_art_references do just that
appellee_br
38 citing panduit 810 f.2d at 1577

with respect to appellants main obviousness arguments appellees point out that because the composition_claims do not contain the corneal_permeability_limitation found in method_claim 6 the corneal_permeability teaching away arguments are irrelevant to claims 12-16
appellees argue that the only composition element appellants deemed missing from the ¡¬456 and ¡¬465 quinolone ophthalmic_formulation patents was an express mention of gatifloxacin for improving corneal_permeability of any drug
appellees argue however that when combined with the ¡¬470_patent this limitation of the claims is obvious
additionally appellees argue there was sufficient reason to combine the claims in these *1346 three patents to render the asserted claims obvious

appellees characterize the ¡¬456_patent as teaching using norfloxacin and structurally related antibodies in topical_ocular_formulations while the ¡¬ 465 patent taught preparing stable ophthalmic fluoroquinolone compositions with both patents containing ingredient ranges encompassing those claimed
both the ¡¬456 and ¡¬465_patent s also taught topical_ocular_formulations containing various features encompassed by the composition_claims such as 0.01 w/v %_edta and 5.2 ph
because the art viewed gatifloxacin as an improved_fluoroquinolone appellees argue that one of ordinary_skill in the art would have had reason to combine the ¡¬470_patents gatifloxacin_disclosure to improve the ¡¬456 and ¡¬465_patent s formulations

appellees also argue that these disclosures combined with appellants failure to dispute that the art viewed gatifloxacin as an improved_fluoroquinolone provides the reason why one of ordinary_skill would want to improve the ¡¬456 and ¡¬465_patent s by incorporating the ¡¬470_patents gatifloxacin
appellees point out that the ¡¬470_patents gatifloxacin eye drop teaching is directed to the same drug class as the ¡¬456 and ¡¬465_patent s and provides evidence that gatifloxacin should work in the ¡¬456_patents formulation

with respect to claims 12-16 we conclude that the district_court properly held these claims obvious
appellants argument relating to the eight year gap between the prior_art and the filing of the ¡¬045_patent_application is unconvincing and not properly raised
appellants only show of support for this issue being raised prior to this appeal is a single citation to the district_court_opinion in which appellants argue in a footnote that the district_court` acknowledged the vintage of the prior_art' citing to portions of the district_court_opinion that merely recite the years in which the prior_art was published
appellant_br
19_n._4_(citing_j.a._10-14)
this is insufficient discussion to consider this argument raised at the district_court and this argument is therefore waived
see sage prods. inc. v. devon indus. inc. 126_f.3d_1420 1426 fed.cir.1997 finding that` [ w ] ith few notable exceptions.. appellate courts do not consider a partys new theories lodged first on appeal'

for the purpose of claims 12-16 the main focus of appellants appeal brief was on the inclusion of the corneal_permeability_limitation in the analysis of the validity of these claims
we conclude that the district_court properly found that corneal_permeability is not relevant in the discussion of composition_claims 12-16 because these claims do not contain the corneal_permeability_limitation found in method_claim 6 discussed below
j.a
24_n._25

we do not find persuasive appellants argument that it is necessary to consider corneal_permeability when analyzing claims 12-16 because the claimed compositions embody the method of reexamined_claim 6
the leo_pharmaceutical_products ltd. v. rea 726_f.3d_1346 1349-50 fed.cir.2013 case appellants cite in support of their argument examines a composition claim that includes as a limitation the function of the composition
in composition_claims 12-16 of the ¡¬045_patent there is no limitation denoting the function of the composition and we decline to import this limitation into the claims
see phillips v. awh corp. 415_f.3d_1303 1323 fed.cir.2005 stating that we have repeatedly warned against confining the claims to particular embodiments in the written description

further there were several other factors in leo pharmaceutical that led the court to conclude that the claims were nonobvious including a lack of reasons for *1347 one of ordinary_skill in the art to combine the asserted prior_art_references
leo pharm. 726 f.3d at 1354
in the present_case there were sufficient reasons to improve upon the ¡¬456 and ¡¬465_patent s by utilizing gatifloxacin as disclosed in the ¡¬470_patent and described fully below
all three of these patents relate to quinolones and their derivatives for use as antibacterial agents and we conclude that the district_court properly determined that combining them would have been obvious to one of ordinary_skill in the art

the ¡¬045 and ¡¬456_patent s disclose ophthalmic quinolone compositions in topical_ocular_formulations which gave reasons to one of ordinary_skill in the art to combine with the gatifloxacin_disclosure of the ¡¬470_patent because gatifloxacin was recognized in the art as an improved_fluoroquinolone
appellants never disputed that the art viewed gatifloxacin as an improved_fluoroquinolone
thus it would have been obvious to improve the ¡¬ 456 and ¡¬465_patent formulations by incorporating the ¡¬470 pa-tents gatifloxacin

many of appellants arguments on the lack of reasons to combine the teachings of these three patents rely on the fact that they do not disclose anything about corneal_permeability of gatifloxacin_solutions
as discussed above this is not a limitation of claims 12-16 and therefore is not relevant to the obviousness_determination

lastly the use of gatifloxacin with edta would have been obvious to a person of ordinary_skill in the art
edta is listed among eight` conventional ingredients' in the ¡¬456_patent and a similar group of excipients
¡¬456_patent 2:1-16 ; ¡¬456_patent 2:36-49
further the use of 0.big_token__3_to_0__big_token8 w/v % of gatifloxacin is outlined in the prior_art such as in the ¡¬456_patent 1:37-43` from about 0.big_token__03_to_3__big_token_%' and in the ¡¬465_patent 2:22-25` preferably about 0.3 % to 5 %_w/v'
as the district_court pointed out the use of 0.01 w/v %_edta was also known from the ¡¬456_patent which discloses an exemplary formulation of 0.3 % quinolone solution that incorporates 0.01 w/v %_edta and teaches using` from about 0.big_token__03_to_3__big_token_% and especially 0.15 % to 0.6 % of medicament although higher or lower dosages can be employed'
¡¬456_patent at 1:37-40 4:1-23

based on the foregoing we conclude that the district_court properly held that claims 12-16 were invalid as obvious

next we analyze whether method_claim 6 would have been obvious
in general appellants argue that the district_court improperly found that all of the features of claim 6 of the ¡¬045_patent are disclosed in the prior_art and that appellees failed to prove invalidity of claim 6 by clear and convincing_evidence
specifically appellants argue that nothing in the prior_art reasonably suggested that the claimed limitations of 0.01 w/v %_edta at ph 5-6 would have any effect in improving gatifloxacins corneal_permeability in vivo
in fact appellants argue the prior_art expressly taught that these claimed limitations would have no effect on corneal_permeability

appellants argue that several prior_art_references which teach away from the claimed invention including the mitra and kompella_references are notably absent from the district_courts invalidity analysis
appellants argue that the district_courts boilerplate language stating that it had` considered the documentary_evidence and testimony' is insufficient to discharge the challengers burden of proving obviousness
appellant_reply_br
3 citing in re cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsule patent litig. 676_f.3d_1063 1075 1077 fed.cir.2012
appellants argue that by addressing only those references that in the view of the district_court pointed towards obviousness the *1348 district_court failed to weigh all of the evidence on both sides of the question of invalidity

appellants argue that the prior_art taught the use of high edta_concentrations to increase corneal_permeability not the use of low_edta_concentrations such as those disclosed in the ¡¬045_patent
for example appellants argue that in the kompella_reference researchers used edta at a concentration of 0.5 w/v % fifty times that of the ¡¬045_patent to increase corneal_permeability of several beta-blockers while also teaching that increasing ph to 8.4-well above the claimed ph range of 5-6-improved corneal_permeability
appellants further argue that the mitra_reference expressly discouraged seeking to improve corneal_permeability using the claimed edta_concentration in vivo reporting that such concentrations are` devoid of any effects' in in vitro experiments
thus appellants argue both mitra and kompella suggest a line of development pointing towards higher_edta_concentrations and higher ph_levels to increase corneal_permeability-and thus away from the claimed invention

appellants also argue that the grass_references do not render claim 6 obvious
specifically appellants argue that grass 1985 did not study the corneal_permeability of gatifloxacin or any quinolone nor did it employ concentrations and conditions resembling those specified in the reexamined_claims
further appellants argue that grass_1988-i explicitly reported that 0.01 w/v %_edta has` 0' effect on corneal_permeability in vitro reporting the results for 0.01 w/v %_edta statistically indistinguishable from zero
appellants argue that the district_court improperly focused on the grass_1988-i raw_data to find increased permeability even though the percentage_change was reported as zero

appellants further argue that the district_courts reliance on the rojanasakul_reference was misplaced
appellants point out that rojanasakul did not measure the passage of any molecule through the corneal_membrane rather rojanasakul measured changes in the electrical_resistance of corneal tissue using electrical_resistance as a general proxy for membrane permeability of ions
according to appellants appellees did not deny that rojanasakul did not measure the corneal_permeability of any molecule relying only on attorney argument to support its position that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have expected electrical_resistance to correlate with the corneal transport of gatifloxacin based on rojanasakul
further appellants argue that the district_court misconstrued rojanasakul which uses` permeability' to refer not only to the permeability of the corneal_membrane comprising the surface of the eye but also to permeability of the plasma membrane surrounding individual cells
thus the increase in permeability disclosed in rojanasakul is not applicable to the asserted claims

appellants argue that because none of the ¡¬456 ¡¬465 and ¡¬470_patent_s even mention corneal_permeability these prior_art_patents would not have provided a reason for a skilled_artisan to seek improved corneal_permeability using low_edta_concentrations
appellants argue that if it was as simple as incorporating gatifloxacin into existing formulations as appellees contend this invention would have likely been achieved within months as opposed to the eight years that passed before anyone conceived the claimed compositions
appellants argue that the inclusion of edta among the possible excipients mentioned in the ¡¬456 and ¡¬465_patent s does not render its eventual use in raising corneal_permeability of gatifloxacin unpatentable because the asserted claims at a minimum *1349 present a new way of using an existing drug

lastly appellants argue that the prior_art taught the use of higher ph not lower ph to improve corneal_permeability
appellants argue that the prior_art uniformly taught using ph_levels higher than the claimed range of 5-6 citing grass 1985 ph 7.4 grass_1988-i ph 7.4-7.6 grass_1988-ii ph 7.4 kompella ph 8.4 and rojanasakul ph 7.4
appellants point out that the only evidence appellees have of a change in permeability is a decrease in permeability when lowering the ph not an increase in permeability with a decrease in ph as claimed in the patent
thus appellants argue that the evidence confirms the surprising_nature of the inventors discovery that 0.01 %_w/v %_edta_formulations significantly increase gatifloxacin_concentrations in the aqueous_humor even at relatively low_ph_levels

appellees respond that appellants experts offered no opinions defending the non-obviousness of the claim elements relating to ph gatifloxacin percentages use of isotonic_agents or the combination thereof in an ophthalmic_formulation
instead appellees argue appellants expert opined solely upon the question of whether one of ordinary_skill would expect 0.01 w/v %_edta to work to increase corneal_permeability
thus the district_court correctly found that all of the features of the asserted claims of the ¡¬045_patent are disclosed in the prior_art

appellees argue that the district_court was not obligated to cite the kompella and mitra_references in its opinion
appellee_br
45 citing myspace inc. v. graphon corp. 672_f.3d_1250 1263-64 fed.cir.2012 ; plant genetic sys. n.v. v. dekalb genetics corp. 315_f.3d_1335 1343 fed.cir.2003
appellees point out that the district_court explained that it considered the documentary_evidence and testimony along with the parties post-trial briefing which discussed both of these references
thus appellees argue the references were presumptively considered

further appellees argue that neither the kompella or mitra_references teach away from the claimed invention
according to appellees the kompella_reference says nothing derogatory about 0.01 w/v %_edta or lower ph ranges never even testing or commenting on 0.01 w/v %_edta_formulations
appellees also argue that the mitra_reference nowhere discourages investigation or dissuades the development of 0.01 w/v %_edta_formulations for polar drugs such as gatifloxacin which has an ability to readily ionize and contains several polar moieties
j.a
10
in fact appellees argue appellants mischaracterize the disclosure in mitra that 0.big_token__2_and_5__big_token mm edta doses are devoid of any effects omitting the important fact that the numbers for these tests were with a different compound even without edta that had no transport across the membranes
appellees argue that mitra supports grasss teachings that a range of edta_levels increased corneal_permeability recognizing that an edta drug combination deserves some consideration in improving the bioavailability of poorly penetrating drugs
appellee_br

appellees add that grass 1985 taught the broad effect of edtas corneal_permeability-increasing properties recognizing that since` chelating agents are added routinely to ophthalmic_medications for stability purposes' the results of the grass tests would have a` direct bearing upon ophthalmic solutions currently in use' even though such solutions used edta amounts` at lower_concentrations'
appellee_br
10-11 citing j.a
2707 2709-10
appellees also argue that appellants mischaracterize the grass_1988-i and grass_1988-ii references as establishing a 0.01 *1350 w/v % threshold where edtas effect on corneal_permeability was zero
instead as lupins expert explained it is appellees position that the art showed the skilled_person that` edta works at exceedingly low_concentrations' and did not` magically start' at a specific number
appellee_br
12-13 citing j.a
1695
appellees further point out that there is no support for appellants argument that the` 0' assigned to the 0.01 w/v %_edta numbers in table xiii of grass_1988-i means that the measured result is unreliable
instead appellees argue this` 0' simply signifies that the data did not reach statistical_significance even though one of ordinary_skill reading grass_1988-i observed raw_data confirming an actual measured increase of corneal_permeability even at 0.01 w/v %_edta_levels

as characterized by appellees senjus arguments with respect to rojanasakul include a variety of uncited attorney characterizations about the references teachings that no trial witness offered
appellees point to rojanasakuls teaching that changes in electrical_resistance and capacitance correlate well with changes in the aqueous intercellular space and membrane surface integrity respectively to support the relevance of rojanasakuls finding that electrical_resistance changed after being exposed to edta_levels as low as 0.00037 w/v %
because appellants admit that intercellular space is the space between cells through which gatifloxacin travels appellees argue that a person of ordinary_skill in the art could reasonably conclude that even very low edta_levels would impact the cellular junctions thereby promoting transport of gatifloxacin

with respect to claim 6 we conclude that the district_court properly held this claim invalid as obvious in light of the ¡¬456 ¡¬465 and ¡¬470_patent_s along with the grass 1985 grass_1988-i grass_1988-ii and rojanasakul_references.8 we find that the district_court applied correct legal standards accepting that the ¡¬045_patent was entitled to a presumption of validity ; that appellees had to establish the underlying factual proofs of obviousness by clear and convincing_evidence ; and that the court properly considered all of the relevant evidence
see sciele_pharma_inc. v. lupin_ltd. 684_f.3d_1253 1260 fed.cir.2012` whether a reference was previously considered by the pto the burden is the same clear and convincing_evidence of invalidity
``

though the district_court did not specifically cite to kompella and mitra in its opinion this is not fatal because neither the mitra nor the kompella_reference actually teach away from utilizing a lower edta_concentration at the claimed ph level
while both references find success at higher_edta_concentrations they do not provide any indication that lower_edta_concentrations would not also work
see j.a
2811 2772
because the district_court was not required to directly address these references and the references do not provide evidence of teaching away from the ¡¬045_patent disclosure the district_court did not commit clear_error in its analysis
see myspace inc. 672 f.3d at 1263 finding that` [ w ] here the record adequately supports the judgment the district_court does not have an obligation to recite every detail of its reasoning' citing lexion med. llc v. northgate techs. inc. 641_f.3d_1352 1359 fed.cir.2011

*1351 appellants focus on the use of 0.01 w/v %_edta to increase corneal_permeability as the distinguishing feature of claim 6
however this feature does not sufficiently distinguish claim 6 from the prior_art
the asserted references demonstrate that one of ordinary_skill in the art would have known that using 0.01 w/v %_edta would result in an increase in corneal_permeability
specifically we look to grass 1985 which suggests that edta_concentrations lower than 0.5 w/v %_would be effective in view of the increased corneal_permeability of the 0.5 w/v %_edta formulation to which calcium was added
j.a
2710
this disclosure in grass 1985 would lead one of ordinary_skill to apply this teaching in conjunction with the pre-existing quinolone formulations which incorporated between 0.big_token__05_and_0__big_token1 w/v %_edta in arriving at a gatifloxacin formulation characterized by increased corneal_permeability
see e.g. j.a
2712-13

contrary to appellants arguments that the prior_art teaches that the use of 0.01 w/v %_edta fails to increase corneal_permeability of either of the polar compounds tested the prior_art actually teaches that adding edta to any polar compound will increase corneal_permeability dose-dependently
for example after experimenting with higher_concentrations grass_1988-i tested 0.1 0.05 and 0.01 w/v %_edta finding that each concentration raised corneal_permeability even though not all of the increases were statistically significant
j.a
2780
appellants improperly focus on the percentage_change in permeability over the control which was zero for both methanol and glycerol to conclude that the data showed no increase in corneal_permeability
in reality though the percent changes were not statistically significant appellees set forth expert testimony that a person of ordinary_skill would have recognized from the data that 0.01 w/v %_edta would increase corneal_permeability
j.a
1695
this testimony is consistent with other prior_art such as rojanasakul which confirmed a dose dependent relationship between edta_concentration and corneal_permeability testing concentrations of edta as low as 0.00037 w/v %
j.a
2795-96
thus the prior_art suggests that the use of concentrations as low as 0.01 w/v %_edta would be effective to increase corneal_permeability

at bottom the district_courts analysis rests largely on a determination that lupins experts were more credible than senjus experts
j.a
30-31
based on this determination the district_court found that grass_1988-i along with the other cited references taught that 0.01 w/v %_edta would be effective to increase corneal_permeability
j.a
31
on the evidence before us that determination by the district_court falls well within the wide discretion the court has to weigh expert credibility
ordinarily and absent compelling reason otherwise an appellate court defers to such credibility determinations

unexpected results
appellants argue that the district_court engaged in an improper post hoc analysis of appellants evidence of unexpected_results concluding that the claims were obvious before fully considering evidence of unexpected_results and without making any finding of the results a skilled_artisan would have expected
appellants point out that a complete administrative record-including the senju studies and the grass 1985 and grass_1988-i references-was before the pto at the reexamination and that the examiners decision to grant the amended and new_claims`carries with it a presumption that [ each ] examiner did his duty and knew what claims he *1352 was allowing
`` appellant_br
53 citing al-site corp. v. vsi int l inc. 174_f.3d_1308 1323 fed.cir.1999 quoting intervet am. inc. v. kee-vet labs. inc. 887_f.2d_1050 1054 fed.cir.1989
thus appellants argue the district_court erred in failing to give weight to the ptos factual_findings on validity and unexpected_results

appellants argue that two pre-litigation studies conducted by senju in 2006 the` ¡¬901 study' and the` ¡¬904 study' measured and compared corneal concentrations of gatifloxacin after administering the compound in solutions with and without edta demonstrating the expected and surprising benefits of the claimed invention
appellants expound that these studies provide undisputed results demonstrating that the addition of 0.01 %_w/v %_edta results in a 27-40 % increase in gatifloxacin in the aqueous_humor
the grass_1988-i reference appellants argue reported a zero percent change in permeability of glycerol upon addition of 0.01 w/v %_edta in vitro and the grass_1988-ii article taught that concentrations of edta about 0.01 w/v %_were needed in vitro to show an effect on corneal_permeability of glycerol
appellants point out that even if grass 1998-i was interpreted as teaching some miniscule increase in corneal_permeability of gatifloxacin with 0.01 w/v %_edta the sheer magnitude of improvement observed in senjus ¡¬901 and ¡¬904_studies would have been unexpected and surprising

appellants further argue that appellees presented no evidence that anyone in 1998 would have expected a low_concentration of edta to produce a significant_increase in gatifloxacins corneal_permeability
in fact appellants argue the remainder of the prior_art_references including grass 1985 mitra and rojanasakul reinforce the surprising results of senjus ¡¬901 and ¡¬904_studies as none of these references suggest that the claimed edta_concentration would result in an increase in aqueous_humor concentrations of glycerol and cromolyn
additionally the prior_art uniformly taught using ph_levels higher than the claimed range of 5-6 confirming the surprising_nature of the inventors discovery that 0.01 w/v %_edta_formulations significantly increase gatifloxacin_concentrations in the aqueous_humor even at relatively low_ph_levels

appellees respond that the district_court properly found the claims obvious only after considering appellants unexpected_results_evidence and finding it unpersuasive
despite senju setting forth a persuasive case before the examiner at the uspto their theories collapsed before the district_court
appellees point out testimony from appellants expert who testified that the ¡¬ 901 study did not show the gatifloxacin-0.01 w/v %_edta solution produced corneal_permeability benefits that were statistically significant compared to a non-edta solution
appellees argue that the district_court heard testimony from both experts weighed their credibility and reviewed grass_1988-i as a whole before finding more credible lupins experts opinions that the skilled_person would not interpret grass_1988-i as teaching` no increase' occurred at 0.01 w/v %_edta

appellees also argue that the raw_data reported in grass_1988-i shows that numerically the corneal_permeability levels did increase compared to control even with the 0.01 w/v %_edta_formulations
appellees point out that the 27_and_40 % permeability increase numbers in the raw_data appellants rely on for evidence of unexpected success occurred in studies where all of the numbers including control values widely varied with large unexplained error bars
appellees argue that if a mere ph adjustment of one unit can produce a 30 % difference in corneal *1353 permeability and ph adjustments are routinely done appellants 27-40 % change in corneal_permeability with 0.01 w/v %_edta has a magnitude achievable by other formulation tweaks and routine practice
further appellees argue the district_court properly found that achieving changes on this order of magnitude reflected the` product of routine_optimization'
j.a
33-34

appellees argue that the district_court properly found the unexpected_results_evidence unpersuasive because the results of the ¡¬901 and ¡¬904_studies were not statistically significant and merely reported numerical increases that were unsurprising in light of grass_1988-i
appellees point out that dr. grass only acknowledged that the senju ¡¬901 study reports a single time point that the study claimed was statistically significant but that lupins statistician demonstrated this time point was statistically insignificant under a correct analysis
appellees argue that senjus studies achieved nothing better than grass_1988-i in which 0.01 w/v %_edta solutions were tested as single doses and showed concentration and time dependence where the 30 minutes permeability numbers quadrupled or more than the 20 minute permeability numbers

we conclude that the district_court properly considered evidence of unexpected_results j.a
32-34 and did not err in finding that based on the record and testimony offered the increase in corneal_permeability shown by plaintiffs using a 0.01 w/v %_edta is not unexpected or surprising but is a product of routine_optimization that would have been obvious to one of skill in the art
j.a
3334
these determinations much like many of the obviousness_determinations were based on credibility judgments on which on the evidence before us we defer to the district_court
see celsis in vitro 664 f.3d at 929

we further conclude that the district_court properly applied a presumption of validity considering both the evidence of obviousness and the evidence of unexpected_results to find that appellees set forth clear and convincing_evidence of invalidity in this case
see sciele_pharma_inc. 684 f.3d at 1260
we agree that it was not clear_error for the district_court to conclude that the unexpected_results_evidence that senju relied upon during reexamination j.a
2692 did not withstand scrutiny by lupins experts and the district_court
ultimately the district_court properly concluded that the theories presented during reexamination proved too weak when challenged in a judicial forum to rise to the level of unexpected_results sufficient to rebut a strong case of obviousness
see procter & gamble co. v. teva pharms
usa inc. 566_f.3d_989 994 fed.cir.2009

we have considered and find unpersuasive the remainder of appellants arguments
concluding that the district_court did not err in its judgment that the reexamined_claims at issue are invalid for obviousness we need not reach the issues of infringement and estoppel

newman circuit_judge dissenting
in prior_litigation the district_court held senjus patent claims invalid on the ground of obviousness
before that decision reached finality senju requested pto reexamination presenting new_claims of significantly narrowed scope
the pto reexamined senjus *1354 u.s. patent no._6333,045` the ¡¬045_patent` and held the narrowed claims patentable
in this subsequent litigation the district_court gave no deference to the ptos review of the restricted claim scope or the unexpected_results at that scope and held the narrowed claims invalid on the same grounds it previously applied to the original claims.1

my colleagues on this panel repeat that flawed analysis they do not consider the scope of the reexamined_claims the unexpected_results at that scope and the teaching-away of the prior_art
i respectfully dissent for these claims have not been shown to be invalid

discussion
the senju_inventors discovered that a composition containing the antibiotic gatifloxacin enhances corneal_permeability when combined with very low amounts of ethylenediaminetetracetic acid edta at a specific ph
this is the appellants zymarthe_r product whose commercial and medicinal success is the impetus for this hatch-waxman_act challenge to senjus patent

the prior_art is crowded
it contains much data on quinolones the family of which gatifloxacin is a member
the prior_art also shows the use of chelating agents such as edta as excipients that enhance stability of ophthalmic_medications
however no combination of prior_art_references shows or suggests the use of very low_concentrations of edta to enhance the corneal_permeability of antibiotic formulations of gatifloxacin or of any other quinolone

in this crowded field the specific_combination and concentration here claimed is not shown and the published scientific data lead away from the claimed subject_matter
these inventors discovered that when using edta at a concentration of 0.01 w/v % the formulation is not only effective as an antibiotic but contrary to the prior_art increases the corneal_permeability of gatifloxacin

¡¬045_patent col. 1_l._25 -col. 2_l._5

during reexamination the pto examiner found that no reference or combination of references teaches or suggests the improved corneal_permeability obtained using edta at the low_concentration of 0.01 w/v %
the prior_art experimental data show either no effect at 0.01 w/v % or enhanced permeability at concentrations above 0.01 w/v %

no reference shows improved corneal_permeability at such low_concentrations of edta ; all indications are that the edta_concentration should be above 0.01 w/v %
the senju discovery contradicts the observations reported in the prior_art
nonetheless the panel_majority holds that it was obvious that superior results would be obtained by reducing the concentration

grass_1988-i shows that edta at a concentration of 0.01 w/v % produced a zero percent increase in corneal_permeability measured for both methanol and glycerol
grass_1988-i also states that the in vitro experiments were performed at exposures 3 hours significantly longer than most topical applications would provide yet the reported data are that edta at 0.01 w/v %_was totally ineffective

grass_1988-i concludes that corneal_permeability increases with increased concentration of edta
this leads directly away from any suggestion or expectation of improved permeability of gatifloxacin_formulations with concentrations of edta as low as 0.01 w/v %

opthalmic drug delivery systems ashim k. mitra ed. marcell dekker inc. 1993` mitra'

the mitra book summarizes the research and knowledge in this field and states that experiments using low_concentrations of edta were` devoid of any effects 62 suggesting a concentration dependence'
mitra at 188
mitra states that edta-drug combinations` deserve investigation' but that` [ i ] t seems likely that the high concentration of divalent cations in the tear film would prevent edta from enhancing permeability'
id
mitra adds that while improving drug transport across the cornea found some success` it is in the modification of the drug that has generated greater interest'
id

the panel_majority rejects the argument that mitra teaches away from senjus discovery stating that mitra does not` provide any indication that lower_edta_concentrations would not also work'
maj. op.at 1350
that is not the law of` teaching away'
a reference need not foresee a later-discovered invention and warn against it to teach away from the discovery
spectralytics inc. v. cordis corp. 649_f.3d_1336 1343 fed.cir.2011

a reference teaches away when it leads to a path divergent from that taken by the patentee
pozen inc. v. par pharm. inc. 696_f.3d_1151 1165 fed.cir.2012
mitra explicitly sets forth two separate paths for investigation-high_concentrations of edta and drug modification-both of which diverge from the path in claim 6
the entire body of prior_art leads in the direction opposite to reducing the edta_concentration for the body of prior_art points toward higher not lower concentrations of edta to enhance corneal_permeability

other references
three other references relied on by the district_court u.s._patent_nos._4551,456 ; 4,780,465 ; and 4,980,470 make no mention of improving corneal_permeability
those references describe gatifloxacin as an antibiotic and edta as a traditional excipient i.e. as an inactive drug ingredient ; they contain no teaching or suggestion related to corneal_permeability

the legal conclusion of obviousness
obviousness is a matter of foresight not hindsight
a determination of obviousness requires some reason or suggestion in the prior_art or in common sense that the claimed subject_matter is likely to be effective for its intended purpose
ksr_int l corp. v. teleflex_inc. 550_u.s._398 420-22 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007)
here the prior_art taught away from the claimed combination when it indicated that higher_concentrations of edta are needed to enhance corneal_permeability

the panel_majority relies on the unsupported opinion of lupins expert witness and gives that unsupported opinion greater weight than the experimental data
such reliance is discredited
see daubert v. merrell dow pharm. inc. 509_u.s._579 589 113_s.ct._2786 125_l.ed.2d_469_(1993)` proposed testimony must be supported by appropriate validation-i.e.good grounds based on what is known
in short the requirement that an experts testimony pertain toscientific knowledge establishes a standard of evidentiary reliability
``

contrary to the theory of lupins expert the extensive grass data show no statistically significant enhancement of corneal_permeability in the experiments using edta at low_concentrations or for other chelating agents at low_concentrations
*1357 the prior_art did not test the specific_combination of gatifloxacin and 0.01 w/v % of edta and did not discover the subject_matter that is here claimed

notwithstanding the published contrary data the panel_majority calls upon judicial hindsight and finds that persons skilled in the field of the invention would have recognized that 0.01 w/v %_edta would increase corneal_permeability of gatifloxacin_formulations
however the scientists conducting the grass studies interpreted their data to` suggest that under conditions of sufficient calcium chelation either by high_enough_concentrations of one or more chelators or frequent_application at short intervals preservatives may indeed enter anterior segment tissue'
gras 1988-i at 11
grass suggested` high_enough_concentrations' not very low_concentrations

the published contemporaneous statements of scientists interpreting their experiments warrant more weight than unsupported opinions appearing for the first_time in litigation
grass did not test the composition here patented and reported to be a product now of medical choice

senjus pre-litigation experiments further support the conclusion that one skilled in the art would not have expected to enhance corneal_permeability using the method of claim 6
the district_court acknowledged that the claimed levels of edta were shown in senjus experiments to produce a significant_increase in the concentration of gatifloxacin in the aqueous_humour
nevertheless the court faulted senjus expert because he did not use statistical analysis to show that the effects were unexpected
statistical analysis can indeed be helpful at times but the perspective of those skilled in the art can not be ignored
with the exception of lupins expert witnesses those skilled in the art interpreted senjus experiments as demonstrating unexpected_results

conclusion
the scientific references the experimental record and the commercial success all support the conclusion that the subject_matter of claim 6 would not have been obvious to a person of ordinary_skill at the time of the invention
the pto on reexamination correctly applied the law of obviousness
invalidity of reexamined_claim 6 was not proved by clear and convincing_evidence
from my colleagues contrary ruling i respectfully dissent

with regard to appellants` size-dependent' theory it was untimely because appellants provided no evidence that they alleged gatifloxacins size precluded movement through edta-created intercellular_spaces
the district_court properly excluded this argument as untimely and we decline to address it further
