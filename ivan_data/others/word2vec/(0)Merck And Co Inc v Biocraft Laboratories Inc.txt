opinion
mayer circuit_judge
merck & co. inc. sued biocraft_laboratories inc. for infringement of its patent u.s._patent_no._3781,430
the united_states_district_court for the district of new_jersey held that biocraft failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that the patent was invalid or unenforceable and enjoined biocraft from commercially making using and selling the claimed diuretic formulations
merck & co. inc. v. biocraft_laboratories inc. 690_f.supp._1376 d.n.j.1988
biocraft appeals only the validity aspect of the judgment arguing that the claimed combinations would have been obvious under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103
we agree and accordingly reverse the judgment of the district_court

background
the430_patent in relevant part u.s._patent_no._3781,430 the430_patent assigned to merck claims various` diuretic formulations'
inducing diuresis increased urine excretion or saluresis increased electrolyte particularly sodium excretion or both diuretics are useful in the treatment of cardiovascular and renal diseases
although the therapeutic effects of diuretics are often lifesaving many cause hypokalemia the excessive excretion of potassium_ions a condition manifested by severe muscle weakness and physical exhaustion

in the formulations claimed in the430_patent amiloride_hydrochloride amiloride a known` potassium_conserving' diuretic induces sodium but not potassium excretion is combined with hydrochlorothiazide a known` potassium_excreting' diuretic induces both sodium and potassium_excretion
as stated in the specification the objective of co-administration is to reduce the amount of potassium_ions eliminated without reducing the amount of sodium_ions eliminated
the inventor also reports that co-administration results in a` medically.. synergistic therapeutic accomplishment' because` more sodium_ions are eliminated than would be forecast from a knowledge of the natriuretic [ sodium excreting ] effects of the individual drugs'

the430_patent contains six claims
the parties agree however that all of the claims stand or fall with claims 2_and_3
claim 1 on which claim 2 depends and claims 2_and_3 provide as follows 1
a composition for oral_administration comprising amiloride_hydrochloride and *806 hydrochlorothiazide wherein the ratio of amiloride_hydrochloride to hydrochlorothiazide ranges from about 1 1_to_110 by weight of the composition
2
a composition according to claim 1 wherein amiloride_hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide are combined at a ratio of 1_to_1 0 by weight
3
a composition for oral_administration which comprises 5 mg. of amiloride_hydrochloride and 50 mg. of hydrochlorothiazide

the infringement suit mercks suit against biocraft was prompted by biocrafts filing of an abbreviated new drug application anda with the food & drug administration fda for a generic version of mercks amiloride/hydrochlorothiazide_combination` moduretic'
the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 permits the filing if the generic manufacturer can certify its belief that the patent is invalid or will not be infringed by its proposed manufacture use or sale of the drug and notifies the patent_owner of the reasons for its belief
21 u.s.c.¡± 355 b 2 a iv and 3
however under 35 u.s.c.¡± 271 e 2 the filing is a technical act of infringement so infringement is not an issue in this case
if a patent_owner brings an infringement suit the fda can not approve the anda unless the patent is declared invalid or not infringed
21 u.s.c.¡± 355 c 3 c

at trial biocraft argued that the430_patent was invalid for obviousness under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 and unenforceable because of inequitable conduct
the district_court ruled against biocraft on both counts
biocraft predicated its section 103 argument on two prior_art patents and on prior_art relating to spironolactone and triamterene diuretics that like amiloride are potassium_conserving
refreshingly biocraft challenges the judgment of the district_court only as to obviousness and restricts its arguments to the teachings of u.s._patent_no._3313,813 the813_patent also assigned to merck

the813_patent discloses various 3-amino-5,6-disubstituted-pyrazinoyl guanidines one of which is amiloride claim 11
per the specification the claimed compounds are effective diuretic and natriuretic agents
moreover the813_patent teaches that guanidines` selectively enhance the excretion of sodium_ions without causing an increase in excretion of potassium_ions' and` are useful in combination with other classes of diuretic agents to prevent the loss of potassium which the other_diuretics otherwise would cause to be eliminated'
hydrochlorothiazide is identified as an example of a potassium_excreting diuretic with which the claimed compounds can be combined

the813_patent therefore teaches a genus of which the claims of the430_patent are a species
the question addressed in the district_court was whether the813_patent taught the specific 1:10/5 mg:50 mg` medically synergistic' amiloride/hydrochlorothiazide combination claimed in the430_patent
biocraft argued that the claimed combination was taught because both amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide were highlighted in the813_patent
moreover biocraft pointed out that the patent and trademark office considered the claimed combination prima facie obvious and allowed the430_patent only after merck presented evidence allegedly demonstrating a natriuretic synergism produced by the combination
asserting that the alleged synergistic effect is not exhibited by the 5 mg:50 mg combination and that therefore the effect even if produced is not commensurate in scope with the claims biocraft argued that neither the purported effect nor the dosage_limitations distinguish the claims from the disclosure of the813_patent
the district_court however was not persuaded and held that biocraft failed to carry its burden of proving the obviousness of the claims
this appeal followed

discussion
the district_court found that the combination of amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide was disclosed in the813_patent
690 f.supp.at 1383
further finding that more than 1200 combinations are disclosed *807 and that neither amiloride nor hydrochlorothiazide are highlighted as preferred embodiments in the813_patent however the district_court concluded that the combinations claimed in the430_patent would merely be` obvious to try' and therefore not barred by 35 u.s.c.¡± 103
we do not quarrel with the factual_findings of the district_court but we believe its conclusion that obviousness had not been proven is incorrect as a matter of law

an invention is` obvious to try'` where the prior_art [ gives ] either no indication of which parameters [ are ] critical or no direction as to which of many possible choices is likely to be successful'
in re_o'farrell 853_f.2d_894 903 7_uspq2d_1673 1681 fed.cir.1988
this is not the situation here
the813_patent expressly teaches` that when co-administered with other_diuretic_agents known to enhance the elimination of potassium_ions along with sodium_ions the novel pyrazinoylguanidines of this invention will reduce the excretion of potassium_ions and thus overcome this undesirable property of other_diuretic_agents'
as is apparent` success' is not dependent upon random variation of numerous parameters
on the contrary the813_patent instructs the artisan that any of the 1200 disclosed combinations will produce a diuretic formulation with desirable sodium and potassium eliminating properties

that the813_patent discloses a multitude of effective combinations does not render any particular formulation less obvious
this is especially true because the claimed composition is used for the identical purpose taught by the prior_art
see in re corkill 771_f.2d_1496 1500 226_uspq_1005 1008 fed.cir.1985 obviousness_rejection of claims affirmed in light of prior_art_teaching that` hydrated zeolites will work' in detergent formulations even though` the inventors selected the zeolites of the claims from amongthousands of compounds' ; in re susi 440_f.2d_442 445 169_uspq_423 425 58_ccpa_1074_(1971) obviousness_rejection affirmed where the disclosure of the prior_art was` huge but it undeniably include [ d ] at least some of the compounds recited in appellants generic claims and it is of a class of chemicals to be used for the same purpose as appellants additives'

merck imputes undue significance to the district_courts finding that neither amiloride nor hydrochlorothiazide are highlighted in the813_patent
the description of` specific preferences in connection with a generic formula' is determinative in an analysis of anticipation under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102
in re petering 301_f.2d_676 681 133_uspq_275 279 49_ccpa_993_(1962) ; see also in re schaumann 572_f.2d_312 315 316 197_uspq_5 8 9 ccpa 1978` the disclosure of a chemical genus.. constitute [ s ] a description of a specific_compound' within the meaning of section 102 b where the specific_compound falls within the ambit of a` very limited number of compounds'
but in a section 103 inquiry` the fact that a specific [ embodiment ] is taught to be preferred is not controlling since all disclosures of the prior_art including unpreferred embodiments must be considered'
in re lamberti 545_f.2d_747 750 192_uspq_278 280 ccpa 1976

merck also attributes determinative importance to the district_courts finding that the813_patent does not describe` the effects that the combined drug would have on sodium_excretion potassium_excretion and ratio of sodium_excretion to potassium_excretion' that are described in the specification of the430_patent 690 f.supp.at 1383 nor does it` teach the specific_ratios of the combinations' disclosed in the430_patent id
but the mere absence from the prior_art of a teaching or a limitation recited in the patent at issue is insufficient for a conclusion of nonobviousness
unlike a section 102 defense which requires that a single reference describe each and every element of a claimed invention structural rubber products co. v. park rubber co. 749_f.2d_707 715 223_uspq_1264 1270 fed.cir.1984` the question under 35_usc_103 is not merely what the references expressly teach but what they would have suggested to one of ordinary_skill in the art at the time the invention was made'
*808 in re lamberti 545 f.2d at 750 192 uspq at 280
that this distinction was missed is evident from the district_courts erroneous assertion that because the813_patent`suggests` but does not`teach` the combinations claimed in the430_patent obviousness had not been proven
690 f.supp.at 1383

as prescribed by section 103 the proper focus of an obviousness inquiry is on whether` the differences between the subject_matter sought to be patented and the prior_art are such that the subject_matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary_skill in the art..' merck argues that the dosages and ratios of claims 2_and_3 and the properties of the 5 mg of amiloride and 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide_combination patentably distinguish the claims of the430_patent from the teaching of the813_patent
relying on evidence allegedly demonstrating that the properties merck posits are not exhibited by the 5 mg/50 mg combination biocraft insists that the claims are invalid under section 103 ; but this begs the question
even if mercks representations are accepted the issue remains whether the asserted properties and proportions impart patentability to the claimed inventions or whether the inventions as a whole would have been obvious to one skilled in the art

merck offers several theories to bolster the claimed combinations purportedly nonobvious properties
in response to the examiners rejection of the claims on the ground that the amiloride/hydrochlorothiazide_combination was prima facie obvious merck said that the co-administration of the two diuretics achieved a` medically synergistic' result
this apparently convinced the examiner but it should not have

`` the patent lawallows the inventor to be his own lexicographer` loctite corp. v. ultraseal ltd. 781_f.2d_861 867 228_uspq_90 93 fed.cir.1985 quoting autogiro co. of america v. united_states 384_f.2d_391 397 155_uspq_697 702 181_ct.cl._55_(1976) but he may not compose his own standards of patentability
synergism is not a requirement of nonobviousness
gardner v. tec sys inc. 725_f.2d_1338 1349 220_uspq_777 786 fed.cir.1984 in banc
but when an inventor tries to distinguish his claims from the prior_art by introducing evidence of unexpected` synergistic' properties the evidence should at least demonstrate` an effect greater than the sum of the several effects taken separately'
sakraida v. ag pro inc. 425_u.s._273 282 96_s.ct._1532 1537 47_l.ed.2d_784 189_uspq_449 453 1976
it is insufficient that as merck defines` medical synergism' in the specification of the430_patent the` two drugs react favorably'

at trial merck altered its approach and tried to show that a greater than additive effect in terms of sodium_excretion is obtained when amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide are co-administered
it failed
the district_court said only that amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide can be co-administered` without a reduction in the amount of sodium_ions that are eliminated' 690 f.supp.at 1378 and that the effect of co-administration as set forth in the specification of the430_patent was not described in the813_patent 690 f.supp.at 1383
mercks proposed finding that an unexpectedly strong natriuretic effect occurs was not adopted by the district_court
moreover on appeal merck says only that the evidence at trial` demonstrated that the combination causes more_sodium_excretion than 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide alone'
this is quite different from the proposition advanced at trial and imparts no patentability to the claimed inventions

given the prior_art_teaching that both amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide are natriuretic it is to be expected that their co-administration would induce more_sodium_excretion than would either diuretic alone
see in re crockett 279_f.2d_274 276 126_uspq_186 188 47_ccpa_1018_(1960) the` joint use [ of magnesium_oxide and calcium_carbide ] is not patentable' where the prior_art teaches` that both magnesium_oxide and calcium_carbide individually promote the formation of a nodular structure in cast iron and it would be natural to suppose that in combination they would produce the same effect and would supplement each *809 other'
indeed the inventor named on both the813 and the430_patent s so testified
when asked` is n't it also normal when you administer a potassium_sparing_compound along with hydrochlorothiazide a period of time that there would be some increase in the amount of sodium_excretion ?
`` he responded` that is a possibility
that is not an assured consequence'
but` absolute predictability of success' is not the criterion ;` [ f ] or obviousness under ¡± 103 all that is required is a reasonable expectation of success'
in re_o'farrell 853 f.2d at 903 7 uspq2d at 1681
when further questioned on the point the inventor indicated that his uncertainty inhered not in the fact that an increase was to be expected but only in the magnitude of the increase
this he testified` depends on the amount of potassium_sparing_compound that you have'

mercks further contention that the claimed inventions as a whole would not have been obvious because of the recited dosage_limitations is equally unpersuasive
`` normally it is to be expected that a change in temperature or in concentration or in both would be an unpatentable modification'
in re aller 220_f.2d_454 456 105_uspq_233 235 42_ccpa_824_(1955)
patentability may be imparted however if the results achieved at the designated concentrations are` unexpectedly good'
in re antonie 559_f.2d_618 620 195_uspq_6 8 ccpa 1977
as discussed above this is not the situation here
assuming as merck alleges that` [ t ] he specific combination of 5 mg of amiloride and 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide results in no decrease and indeed an increase in sodium_excretion over hydrochlorothiazide alone' this was to be expected from the known natriuretic properties of the two diuretics

the evidence at trial showed that though requiring time and care the experimentation needed to arrive at the claimed dosages was nothing more than routine
`` patentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which the invention was made'
35 u.s.c.¡± 103
but the converse is equally true patentability is not imparted where` the prior_art would have suggested to one of ordinary_skill in the art that this process should be carried out and would have a reasonable likelihood of success viewed in light of the prior_art'
in re dow chemical co. 837_f.2d_469 473 5_uspq2d_1529 1531 fed.cir.1988

this is precisely the situation here
mercks expert the inventor of hydrochlorothiazide and the witness that the district_court found` most closely represents the hypothetical_person skilled in the art' 690 f.supp.at 1382 testified that the dose response and compatability procedures followed by merck were those that` all pharmaceutical companies [ follow ] whenever they determine the appropriate_dose ; the minimal dose and the appropriate_dose'
after describing the animal and human studies that were conducted he explained` that is the way it is done not only with amiloride but with any other drug that you are testing'
reached by means of routine procedures and producing only predictable results the recited dosages therefore do not distinguish the claims of the430_patent from the amiloride/hydrochlorothiazide_combination that the district_court properly found was disclosed in the813_patent
cf
united_states v. telectronics inc. 857_f.2d_778 785 8_uspq2d_1217 1223 fed.cir.1988 specification is enabling in part because those skilled in the art would know how to conduct a dose response study to determine the appropriate amounts to be used

costs
biocraft moves to tax merck the full_cost of printing the appendix prepared for *810 this appeal
biocraft states that merck disregarded` the spirit if not the letter of fed.cir.r
30 b by citing in its brief portions of the record not specifically relied upon'
we agree
our review of the matter shows for example that merck generally cited hundreds of pages of the record in its preliminary introduction of the witnesses but relied only on a small fraction of those pages in the remainder of its brief ; lengthy scholarly articles were reproduced in their entirety but not relied upon by merck ; and a fully reproduced 700-plus page book though mentioned once by merck was similarly not relied upon

accordingly we grant biocrafts motion
when assessing costs the clerk will tax merck with the full_cost of printing the appendix

the judgment of the district_court is reversed

bissell circuit_judge dissenting
i would affirm the district_courts decision that the claims at issue in united_states_patent_no._3781,430430 were not shown to have been obvious under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 1982
the district_court concluded that a combination of amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide as claimed in the430_patent was merely` obvious to try' based on the prior_art
merck & co. inc. v. biocraft_laboratories inc. 690_f.supp._1376 1381 d.n.j.1988 citing in re geiger 815_f.2d_686 688 2_uspq2d_1276 1278 fed.cir.1987 rejecting` obvious to try' as the standard for determining obviousness

obviousness a question of law is based on underlying factual inquiries

denied 488_u.s._825 109_s.ct._75 102_l.ed.2d_51_(1988)
the parties agree that the closest prior_art to the430_patent is united_states_patent_no._3313,813813
additionally the majority_opinion does not` quarrel with the factual_findings of the district_court'

in pertinent part the district_court stated the813_patent discloses appropriately 120 pyrazinoylguanidine compounds
there is no indication in the patent that amiloride is the preferred compound
thus a person skilled in the art would not be taught by the813_patent that amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide should be combined to produce the effects as set forth in the430_patent
the813_patent does not describe or forecast the effects that the combined drug would have on sodium_excretion potassium_excretion and ratio of sodium_excretion to potassium_excretion
a composition must be assessed for obviousness only after consideration of its chemical structure as well as its pharmaceutical and biological properties
in short while the813_patent` suggests' exploration of combinations of potassium sparing guanidine with potassium losing diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide it does not` teach' the combinations claims in the430_patent
nor does it teach the specific_ratios of the combinations as outlined in claims 2 3 5_and_6 of the430_patent
those claims are sufficiently non-obvious so as to sustain the validity of the patent
since the813_patent discloses in excess of 120 pyrazinoylguanidine and 10 possible_potassium losing diuretics there are more than 1200 possible_combinations of which the combination of amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide would be one
and there is no indication in the813_patent as to the preference for amiloride as opposed to any other pyrazinoylguanidine compound nor hydroclorothiozide [ sic ] as opposed to other_diuretics
nor is there any hint as to the proportions that would be contained in the mixture
again while the813_patent might titillate ones desire to experiment it clearly does not teach and thereby make obvious the claims as outlined in claims 2 3 5_and_6 of the430_patent
merck 690 f.supp.at 1383-84

the majority_opinion incorrectly states that the district_court found` the combination of amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide was disclosed in the813_patent'
the *811 district_court in fact found that the813_patent disclosed` in excess of 120 pyrazinoylguanidine and 10 possible_potassium losing diuretics [ resulting in ] more than 1200 possible_combinations of which the combination of amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide would be one'
id
the813_patent does not disclose a diuretic composition containing amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide

after examining the scope and content of the prior_art the district_court found that the813_patent does not 1 teach one of ordinary_skill in the art a preference for amiloride hydrochlorothiazide or their combination 2` describe or forecast the effects that the combined drug would have on sodium_excretion potassium_excretion and ratio of sodium_excretion to potassium_excretion' and 3 teach the specific ratio limitations of the claims in suit
id
additionally the district_court determined that the813_patent only suggests` exploring' combinations of potassium sparing and potassium losing diuretics and that the prior_art does not teach one of ordinary_skill what is claimed in the430_patent
id
i agree
the claimed invention would not have been obvious in view of prior_art that does no more than suggest experimenting with over 1200 combinations to come up with the right one

the meaning to one of ordinary_skill in the art of the813_patent was extensively explored at trial
based upon this testimony the district_court found that mercks expert the inventor of hydrochlorothiazide` most closely represent [ ed ] the hypothetical_person skilled in the art'
id.at 1382
after reviewing the prior_art mercks expert testified that in 1966 the combination of amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide would not have been obvious and if combined he would not have expected the results achieved

in examining secondary considerations the district_court found` uncontroverted evidence' of commercial_success id.at 1385_n._4 but made no express findings on unexpected_results
yet the majority after extended discussion finds no unexpected_results
absent more definitive findings by the district_court the basis for the majoritys statement escapes me

hindsight is not the standard for determining obviousness
see e.g. uniroyal 837 f.2d at 1050-51 5 uspq2d at 1438
bits and pieces of the invention claimed in the430_patent can be pointed to in the prior_art but only if one is armed with hindsight knowledge
see id
( stating that hindsight reconstruction using the claimed invention as a blueprint is improper
the majoritys opinion does not disturb the district_courts factual_findings
based on these findings i can not agree with the majoritys conclusion that the claims of the430_patent would have been obvious
accordingly i would affirm the district_courts judgment
