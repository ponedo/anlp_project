opinion
bryson circuit_judge
the saunders_group inc. brought this patent infringement action in the united_states_district_court for the eastern_district of virginia docket no._105cv69
saunders alleged that the defendants are liable for infringement of u.s._patent_no._6899,690` the ¡¬690_patent`
the district_court granted summary_judgment of noninfringement on the ground that the asserted independent_claims of the ¡¬690_patent require as one of the limitations of each of those claims the presence of at least one pressure activated seal a limitation that is not found in the accused devices
*1329 saunders now appeals
we hold that the district_courts claim_construction was erroneous and we therefore reverse the grant of summary_judgment and remand for further_proceedings

i. saunders competes with the defendants in the market for relatively inexpensive and lightweight cervical traction devices
cervical traction is a physical therapy treatment in which a device is used to generate a sustained force pulling upward on the patients neck so as to relieve pressure on enflamed or enlarged nerves
the devices at issue in this case allow patients to treat themselves at home

both asserted independent_claims of the ¡¬690_patent claims 1_and_16 are directed to a portable cervical traction device
for purposes of this appeal those claims are identical
claim 1 reads as follows a cervical traction device comprising [ 1 ] a support_structure having a track ; [ 2 ] a carriage having a slide bracket slidable along a portion of the track ; [ 3 ] a restraining mechanism adapted to releasably restrain a portion of a patients body to the carriage ; [ 4 ] a pneumatic_cylinder having a first end and a moveable piston rod at a second end one of the pneumatic_cylinder or the piston rod attached to the support_structure and the other attached to the carriage the pneumatic_cylinder adapted to move the carriage along the track relative to the support_structure when in a pressurized state the pneumatic_cylinder maintaining a generally static_traction_force for a period in excess of 10 minutes when in the pressurized state without additional pressurized air being supplied ; and
[ 5 ] a hand_pump fluidly connected to the pneumatic_cylinder and adapted to inject pressurized air into the pneumatic_cylinder the hand_pump having a handle moveable relative to a body portion to injecting at least 138 kpa 20 psi of pressure into the pneumatic_cylinder
claim 16 is identical to claim 1 except that in the fourth limitation it recites` during a treatment period' in place of` for a period in excess of 10 minutes'

according to the ¡¬690_patent portable_traction_devices that were available at the time of the invention were unsatisfactory because of shortcomings in the methods by which the devices produced the traction_force
pneumatic cylinders with low pressure inputs could not maintain the required force for the requisite amount of time and hydraulic cylinders were not sufficiently portable
¡¬690_patent col._1,_ll._35-43

the ¡¬690_patent is the product of the third in a sequence of related applications
the first application u.s. ser
no._08 /334,189` the ¡¬189_application' was directed to a` portable_traction_device powered by a pneumatic_cylinder'
that application did not issue as a patent
the second application which eventually matured into u.s._patent_no._6506,174` the ¡¬ 174 patent' and which has the same specification as the ¡¬690_patent was a continuation in part of the ¡¬189_application
the ¡¬174_patent contains claims to lumbar traction systems ; it issued after two rejections and an appeal to the board of patent appeals and interferences
all the claims in the ¡¬174_patent explicitly require a pneumatic_cylinder having at least one pressure activated seal
the pneumatic_cylinder portion of *big_token__1330_claim_1__big_token of the ¡¬174_patent is representative and reads as follows with the` pressure activated seal' limitation emphasized a pneumatic traction_force generating apparatus comprising a pneumatic_cylinder attachable to the support_structure adapted to move the carriage relative to the support_structure when the pneumatic_cylinder is in a pressurized state the pneumatic_cylinder having at least one pressure activated seal extending circumferentially around a piston the pressure activated seal movable between a relaxed_position and an extended_position so the pressure activated seal engages an internal_surface on the pneumatic_cylinder when the pneumatic_cylinder is in the pressurized state the pneumatic_cylinder maintaining a static_traction_force for a period in excess of 10 minutes when in the pressurized state without additional pressurized air being supplied

the application that led to the issuance of the ¡¬690_patent was a continuation of the application that led to the ¡¬174_patent
it claimed a cervical traction system instead of a lumbar traction system and it omitted any reference to a` pressure activated seal' in two of the independent_claims claims 1_and_16 and in most of their dependent claims
the` pressure activated seal' limitation was explicitly included in two other independent_claims claims 14_and_15 and in two of the claims that depended from claim 1 claims 6_and_7
in connection with that application the inventors filed a petition to make special in which they alleged that there was a device on the market that infringed certain specified claims of the application
in that petition saunders referred to one of the cervical traction devices at issue in this case
although the petition did not specifically discuss pressure activated seals the only claims alleged to be infringed were those that did not contain an explicit limitation directed to pressure activated seals
the patent and trademark office granted the petition and conducted an expedited examination
the ¡¬690_patent was issued after the patentees overcame various rejections
saunders filed the present infringement action 10 days later

in a combined claim_construction and summary_judgment opinion the district_court held that the term` pneumatic_cylinder' in claim 1 is limited to pneumatic_cylinders containing at least one pressure activated seal
the court noted that the specification` only disclosed one embodiment for the internal workings of the claimed pneumatic_cylinder' and that the specification` teaches no alternative means by which the pneumatic_cylinder can maintain the required traction_force'
the court also ruled that the prosecution_history of the ¡¬ 174 patent contained an unequivocal disclaimer of o-ring type seals in particular and any seal other than a pressure activated seal in general
because saunders admitted that the accused devices do not use pressure activated seals the court granted summary_judgment of noninfringement

ii
on appeal saunders argues that the district_court improperly limited the scope of the term` pneumatic_cylinder'
saunders contends that the term` pneumatic_cylinder' does not inherently require the presence of a pressure activated seal and that nothing in the specification or the prosecution_history suggests that the term_pneumatic_cylinder as used in the patent requires such a seal
for that reason saunders argues claim 1 of the ¡¬ *1331 690 patent reads on the accused products which have pneumatic_cylinders without pressure activated seals

claim terms are generally given the meaning those terms would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art
phillips v. awh corp. 415_f.3d_1303 1313 fed.cir.2005 en banc
it is not disputed that the ordinary meaning of the term` pneumatic_cylinder' does not require the presence of pressure activated seals
the asserted claims can be assigned a narrower scope only if there is some indication in the patent or the prosecution_history that the term_pneumatic_cylinder was meant to have a more restrictive meaning as used in the patent or a broader meaning was disclaimed during prosecution
see phillips 415 f.3d at 1316 ; honeywell int l inc. v. itt indus. inc. 452_f.3d_1312 1319-20 fed.cir.2006 ; scimed life sys. inc. v. advanced cardiovascular sys. inc. 242_f.3d_1337 1342-44 fed.cir.2001
we conclude that the text of the ¡¬690_patent and its prosecution_history do not justify such a restrictive construction of the term

a
the strongest indication that the term_pneumatic_cylinder as used in the ¡¬690_patent was not meant to include pressure activated seals as a matter of definition can be found in a comparison of independent_claim 1 and claim 6 one of the claims that depend from claim 1
claim 1 recites a pneumatic_cylinder but does not expressly require a` pressure activated seal'
claim 6 recites the apparatus of claim 1 and then adds a limitation reciting a pressure activated seal
claim 6 reads as follows emphasis added the apparatus of claim 1 comprising at least one pressure activated seal in the pneumatic_cylinder extending circumferentially around a piston the pressure activated seal movable between a relaxed_position and an extended_position so the pressure activated seal engages an internal_surface on the pneumatic_cylinder when the pneumatic_cylinder is in the pressurized state for engagement with an inside surface of a cylinder housing when in the pressurized state
given that claim 6 adds the pressure activated seal limitation to claim 1 the doctrine of claim differentiation supports the inference that claim 1 encompasses cylinders without pressure activated seals
otherwise claim 6 would add nothing to claim 1 and the two would cover identical subject matter
see phillips 415 f.3d at 1314-15` [ t ] he presence of a dependent claim that adds a particular limitation gives rise to a presumption that the limitation in question is not present in the independent_claim
`` ; liebel-flarsheim_co. v. medrad inc. 358_f.3d_898 910 fed.cir.2004

the defendants argue that there is a meaningful difference in scope between claim 1 and claim 6 under their construction because claim 6 requires the seal to` extend [ ] circumferentially around a piston' while being movable so as to engage the cylinder in a particular place
that language from claim 6 however is better read as simply definitional language that describes the operation of a pressure activated seal
the patent does not disclose any other_way of constructing a pressure activated seal and the recitation of the operation of the pressure activated seal adds nothing of substance to the recitation of the seal itself
the defendants have not pointed to any evidence that those of skill in the art would have understood the referenced *1332 language as carving out a subset of all pressure activated seals

the prosecution_history of the ¡¬690_patent provides further support for saunders argument that the term` pneumatic_cylinder' as used in the patent is not restricted to pneumatic_cylinders that use pressure activated seals
the ¡¬690_patent resulted from a continuation_application claiming priority to an application that specifically required at least one pressure activated seal in all its claims
when the patentees filed the continuation_application they omitted that limitation from some but not all of the new_claims
had they omitted the limitation from all of the claims it might be argued that the limitation was assumed to be present and did not need to be explicitly recited
making such a change to only some of the claims however is a strong indication that the claims not reciting pressure activated seals were not intended to require them

the petition to make special is also significant because the applicants asserted in that document that a device lacking a pressure activated seal infringed the independent_claims of the application
to be sure the petition did not specifically discuss pressure activated seals
it is undisputed however that the petition accused the device of infringing only those claims that lacked a pressure activated seal requirement and that the accused device had no pressure activated seals
under those circumstances the petition indicates that the applicants did not regard the presence of pressure activated seals as a necessary condition for infringement of those claims

b
the defendants point to various features of the patent and the prosecution_history in support of their argument that one of skill in the art would necessarily conclude that only pneumatic_cylinders with pressure activated seals are within the scope of claims 1_and_16 of the ¡¬690_patent
they first contend that such a limitation is evident from the claim_language requiring that the cylinder be capable of` maintaining a generally static_traction_force for a period in excess of 10 minutes when in the pressurized state without additional pressurized air being supplied'
because the specification does not describe any pneumatic_cylinders without pressure activated seals and because the specification does not disclose any other_way to maintain the necessary traction_force the defendants argue that a person of skill in the art would understand that a pressure activated seal is necessary to maintain the recited traction_force
accordingly they contend that the claims must be limited to pneumatic_cylinders with pressure activated seals

a patent that describes only a single_embodiment is not necessarily limited to that embodiment
liebel-flarsheim 358 f.3d at 906 citing cases
`` even where a patent describes only a single_embodiment claims will not be read restrictively unless the patentee has demonstrated a clear intention to limit the claim scope..' innova/pure water inc. v. safari water filtration sys. 381_f.3d_1111 1117 fed.cir.2004 internal quotations omitted
while an assertion by the patentee that using pressure activated seals is the only_way to maintain the needed traction_force would evidence an intention to narrow the scope of the independent_claims the patent contains no such assertion

to be sure the specification of the ¡¬690_patent which is identical to the specification *1333 of the parent_¡¬174_patent contains passages that describe the portable_traction_device as comprising at least one pressure activated seal
see ¡¬690_patent abstract ; col._2,_ll._13-16
but those passages do not expressly state that the pressure activated seal is an essential_component of the invention
while the restrictive language of the specification might be sufficient in other contexts to limit the scope of the claims it is not sufficient in this case where the language of the claims so clearly distinguishes between those claims that require the presence of a pressure activated seal and those that do not
see_liebel-flarsheim 358 f.3d at 908

the defendants argue that the specification in this case closely resembles the one at issue in alloc inc. v. international trade commission 342_f.3d_1361_(fed.cir.2003)
in that case the court construed the claims to include a feature that was common to all the disclosed embodiments but was not explicitly recited as a limitation in any of the claims
the claims at issue in alloc recited floor system features related to` displacement' and` disassembly' of the flooring_components
id.at 1368
the court construed the claims to require` play' between the flooring_components because the patent specifically taught that such play enabled the displacement and disassembly features and because the patent criticized prior_art systems that lacked play as being impossible to disassemble nondestructively
id.at 1369-70
in contrast the ¡¬690_patent does not criticize prior_art cylinders based on their lack of pressure activated seals
the specification indicates that pneumatic_cylinders` typically' can not maintain an adequate traction_force but the patent does not state that the only_way to accomplish the goal of maintaining traction_force is through the use of pressure activated seals
accordingly the specification does not support the narrowing construction that the defendants propose

the defendants next argue that in the prosecution_history the applicants unambiguously disclaimed pneumatic_cylinders lacking pressure activated seals
in making that argument the defendants focus on the prosecution_history of the parent_¡¬174_patent
the fact that the prosecution_history relied upon was created in connection with the parent_application would be unimportant if the claim_language at issue were present in both patent applications
in this case however all the claims in the ¡¬174_patent explicitly require at least one pressure activated seal while the ¡¬ 690 patent omits that language from the asserted claims
at the same time the alleged disclaimer distinguishing the prior_art focused on a particular claim limitation-the` pressure activated seal' limitation found in each of the claims of the ¡¬174_patent -and was not directed to the invention as a whole
see scimed life sys. 242 f.3d at 1343-44
when the purported disclaimers are directed to specific claim_terms that have been omitted or materially altered in subsequent applications rather than to the invention itself those disclaimers do not apply
ventana med
sys
v. biogenex labs. 473_f.3d_1173 1182 fed.cir.2006` [ t ] he doctrine of prosecution disclaimer generally does not apply when the claim_term in the descendant patent uses different language
`` ; invitrogen corp. v. clontech labs. inc. 429_f.3d_1052 1078 fed.cir.2005` [ t ] he prosecution of one claim_term in a parent_application will generally not limit different claim_language in a continuation_application
`` ; *1334 advanced cardiovascular sys
v. medtronic inc. 265_f.3d_1294 1305-06 fed.cir.2001 omitting the claim_term to which the prosecution_history disclaimer argument was directed precluded those statements from being applied to the child application
accordingly any arguments in the prosecution_history of the ¡¬174_patent that distinguish prior_art based on the presence or absence of a pressure activated seal are inapplicable to the ¡¬690_patent

the defendants contend that there is common_language in the applications and that the statements in the prosecution_history of the ¡¬174_patent apply to that common_language
they note that the patentees distinguished the ¡¬174_patent claims not only by arguing that the prior_art lacked pressure activated seals but also by arguing that the prior_art pneumatic_cylinders were unable to maintain the required traction_force a requirement that is found in both the ¡¬174_patent and the ¡¬690_patent
while the statements about traction_force apply to both the ¡¬174_patent and the ¡¬690_patent they do not establish that the cylinder in the ¡¬690_patent must contain a pressure activated seal
that is the prosecution_history contains no argument that the prior_art devices failed to maintain the requisite traction_force because of the absence of activated seals

the first passage from the prosecution_history cited by the defendants distinguishes a prior_art_patent to loveless
the relevant portion of the argument reads as follows the seal in loveless is a conventional o-ring 37 that does not change shape with air pressure
the o-ring 37 is always engaged with the engagement surfaces 41 42 so that the level of friction between the cylinder sleeve 14 and the piston 23 is generally constant
therefore loveless does not disclose the claimed pressure activated seal and no prime facie case of obviousness is set forth
it is asserted on page 6 of the office action that the cylinder of loveless would be able to maintain a static_traction_force for a period in excess of 10 minutes since the air_leakage in the cylinder will not occur
there is no teaching in loveless for this capability
moreover applicants experience has been that such pneumatic_cylinders do leak over time and are not sustainable for maintaining a static_traction_force
applicants submit that the combination and [ sic ] dyer and loveless fails to disclose the claimed pressure activated seal and a pneumatic_cylinder capable of maintaining a static_traction_force for a period of time without addition of pressurized air being supplied
the first paragraph of that passage distinguishes loveless based on the absence of the claimed pressure activated seal and thus is not relevant to the ¡¬690_patent claims at issue
the first three sentences of the second paragraph are relevant to the ¡¬690_patent but they argue only that the loveless seal is incapable of maintaining the required traction_force
they do not state that the loveless cylinder lacks the capacity to maintain sufficient traction_force because it lacked a pressure activated seal
rather the two paragraphs address different limitations of the claims the seal and the need to maintain traction_force
the last sentence is consistent with the two-part structure of the argument and in effect summarizes the two distinguishing arguments
accordingly the cited passage does not constitute a disclaimer of all cylinders lacking pressure activated seals as the defendants contend

the second passage relied on by the defendants discusses a prior_art_patent to gantz
that passage reads as follows *1335 the use of [ the ] rolling diaphragm type piston and cylinder arrangement disclosed in gantz may be the result of the small vacuum pump
the pump disclosed in gantz develops about 0.5 torr of pressure..
the small pressure generated by the pump of gantz makes an air tight piston system with little or no friction extremely important
applicants speculate that any friction due to the sliding seals or air_leakage would render the traction device of gantz inoperative
that argument also fails to demonstrate a relationship between maintaining the traction_force and the presence of pressure activated seals
the passage argues only that the particular_seal disclosed in gantz would not be feasible for use in the patentees invention because it does not maintain the required traction_force
while that passage rejects the particular_seal used in gantz as sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the invention it does not mean that the invention excludes all seals other than pressure activated seals

c. the district_court concluded that` [ a ] t the very least the specification and prosecution_history.. make claims 1_and_16 of the ¡¬690_patent ambiguous as to whether the pneumatic_cylinder must utilize at least one pressure activated seal'
in that setting the court held that it was proper to apply the maxim that claims should be construed to preserve their validity
see phillips 415 f.3d at 1326
the court further concluded that if claims 1_and_16 were construed broadly they would not be enabled because the specification` would provide absolutely no indication of how to construct the claimed invention because a pneumatic_cylinderhaving at least one pressure activated seal is the only pneumatic_cylinder described in the specification' and because the inventors made clear that they did not believe an ordinary o-ring seal would work in a device of the sort they claimed

in light of the structure of the claims with some reciting pressure activated seals and others lacking that limitation the focus of the petition to make special on the defendants device and the absence of any clear disclaimer in the specification or the prosecution_history we hold that the term` pneumatic_cylinder' as used in the ¡¬690_patent encompasses cylinders that do not use pressure activated seals and that claims 1_and_16 are not ambiguous
for that reason it was error for the district_court to use the possible invalidity of those claims if broadly construed as a basis for construing them narrowly
see_liebel-flarsheim 358 f.3d at 911
that is not to say that we reject the district_courts validity_analysis ; we hold only that the courts validity_analysis can not be used as basis for adopting a narrow construction of the claims
instead any validity issues that the defendants have preserved and wish to press can be addressed on remand as was done in the liebel-flarsheim case
see_liebel-flarsheim_co. v. medrad inc. 481_f.3d_1371_(fed.cir.2007) holding invalid claims that had been given a broad construction at the patentees behest in an earlier appeal

while we reverse the district_court on the issue of claim_construction we do not suggest that the resolution of the claim_construction_issue presented in this case or in other similar cases is easy or that the outcome is dictated by the straightforward application of patent law principles
cases such as this one in which predecessor_applications or patents were drawn to *1336 narrow claims and in which the claims in the successor application are arguably broader than the invention described in the specification present difficult questions of both claim_construction and validity
where the applicant expressly and unambiguously states his intention to claim broadly the claim_construction_issue is easier and the question becomes one of validity-whether the specification supports the full breadth of the new_claims
on the other hand where-as in this case-the patentee has not been explicit about the scope of the new_claims the case can pose interdependent problems of both claim_construction and validity
we have concluded that the change in claim_language between the ¡¬174_patent and the ¡¬690_patent and in particular the inclusion of the` pressure activated seal' limitation in some claims and its omission from others is a sufficiently powerful_indicator as to the proper_construction of the asserted claims that it outweighs the portions of the specification in which the invention is described narrowly
we emphasize however that the problem is a difficult one made more so by the failure of applicants to state expressly to the examiner whether for tactical reasons or otherwise the extent to which they intended their new_claims to depart from the scope of the claims in the predecessor_applications
in many such cases as in this one we and the district_court are required to draw sometimes conflicting_inferences from different sources of guidance as to proper claim_construction and to weigh those conflicting_inferences in reaching a conclusion as to the proper_construction
after engaging in that process in this case we reach a different result from that reached by the district_court but not easily

d. finally the defendants argue that even under saunders proposed claim_construction one of the accused devices plainly does not infringe and that the trial courts judgment should be affirmed with respect to that device in any event
we decline to address that factual question and instead leave all issues of infringement to be resolved on remand
we hold only that the district_courts claim_construction was erroneous and on that basis we reverse the summary_judgment of noninfringement
we remand for further_proceedings on all remaining issues presented in this case

each party shall bear its own costs for this appeal

reversed and remanded
