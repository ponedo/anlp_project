synopsis
holder of patents for laser bar_code scanners brought suit alleging that bar_code scanning devices were infringing and alleged infringer filed counterclaim for declaratory_judgment that two patents were invalid and unenforceable
the united_states_district_court for the southern_district of new_york kimba m. wood j. concluded that patents were not proven invalid or unenforceable and found infringement
alleged infringer appealed
the court of appeals clevenger circuit_judge held that 1 laser bar_code scanner patents using` aim and shoot' feature and using repetitive self-scanning of bar_code_symbol until it is decoded were not shown to be invalid for obviousness although prior_art included portable_laser_scanning_head which detected and decoded laser_beams reflected from bar_codes and erroneously excluded prior_art_reference disclosed laser scanning head for reading bar_code_symbols that had trigger and 2 patent for laser bar_code scanning device with` aim and shoot' feature was not available as reference against divisional patent which included` aim and shoot' feature but also additional features including means for repetitively self-scanning bar_code_symbol until it was decoded and termination of repetitive_scan if no successful_decode were achieved so the divisional patent application was not invalid for obviousness-type_double_patenting

i
background
the patents relate to devices that employ lasers to read bar_code_symbols and methods of their use
the application that issued as the297_patent was filed on february 29 1980
in the first official action the examiner required restriction to one of seven species identified as groups i-vii
the applicants elected group i claims directed to a light-weight_laser_scanning_head which matured into the297_patent

the297_patent specification refers to two types of previously known laser scanning devices
the first type often mounted in supermarket and other checkout counters requires a user to bring the symbol-bearing object to the stationary scanner
its usefulness is limited to decoding symbols on objects that can be brought to the device
the second_type uses a wand or pen that emits a scanning laser_beam
the user places the pen in physical_contact with the object then manually drags the pen across the symbol
this second_type requires user training because successful_decoding depends on pen angle pressure and speed of passage as the pen is dragged across the bar_code
multiple passes of the pen are often required to achieve a single reading
moreover the tips of pen scanners tend to scar the bar_codes and are not useful on wax coated containers such as milk cartons on soft products such as bagged potato chips or on reflective aluminum cans

in contrast the invention claimed in the297_patent is a portable light-weight_laser_scanning_head that operates without physical_contact with the bar_code
see figure 1
in gun-like fashion the user sights the bar_code unobstructed by the device then depresses a trigger to initiate decoding
each time the trigger is depressed the hand-held device sweeps a scanning laser_beam laterally across the bar_code by use of mirrors
the examiner considered this` aim and shoot' feature to be a novel distinguishing characteristic of the claimed invention over the prior_art
all of the asserted297_patent claims depend on claim 1 reprinted in the appendix which in pertinent_part claims the` aim and shoot' feature as c miniature optic_means.. to permit the user to conveniently register the laser_light_beam on the symbol by sighting the symbol along a direct_line of sight which does not pass through the housing ; d miniature_scanning_means mounted in the light_path and in the interior_space of the housing for cyclically sweeping the laser_light_beam across the bar_code_symbol for reflection_therefrom ;

* * * * * * h handle means for normally supporting the light-weight_laser_scanning_head in a non-contacting relationship with the symbol during reading thereof ; and
*1573 i manually actuatable_trigger_means on the housing for initiating reading of the symbol each time the trigger means is manually actuated by the user

?
-- -- -

before the297_patent issued the applicants filed a divisional_application directed to the originally non-elected group_vi_claims described in the restriction as a` method' of scanning sensing and decoding bar_code_symbols
thereafter the applicants filed a continuation of the divisional_application which eventually issued as the186_patent
the186_patent contains apparatus_claims 1-10 and method_claims 11-15 with the method_claims closely corresponding to the original group_vi_claims
the broadest asserted apparatus and method_claims reprinted in the appendix both require a` trigger' and` repetitively' scan` the directed laser_beam across each symbol for reflection_therefrom'
thus the186_patent claims a system that repetitively scans and senses a bar_code_symbol each time a user depresses the trigger
each symbol is decoded from repetitive rather than single scans thereby increasing the likelihood of achieving accurate decoding even for poorly printed symbols
in addition claim 1 and claim 11 include limiting language for` determining a successful_decoding of each symbol' and for` non-manually terminating the reading of each symbol upon the determination of the successful_decoding thereof'
see appendix
thus the invented_system alerts the user and automatically stops scanning when the symbol is decoded permitting rapid and sequential decoding of multiple objects

the same applicants claimed an advance over the invention of the297_patent in an application filed on january 25 1982 which later issued as the470_patent
the470_patent specification explains that because the scanning laser_beam of the invention *1574 claimed in the297_patent passes through the inside of the device` a great deal of interiordead space within the head' is required in order to accommodate the scanning beam

in contrast the470_patent discloses a scanning head with a raised rear window that emits the laser_beam over the outside top of the device rather than inside its housing
claim 1 of the470_patent reprinted in the appendix includes g window_means mounted on the housing and having a light-transmissive_window at the rear_region in close adjacent confronting relationship with the scanning means thereat said window being configured and positioned in the light_path of said at least one swept beam to permit the latter to pass through the window and unobstructedly travel exteriorly of and past the front and intermediate_body_regions of the housing
whereby the field of view of the swept beam is substantially independent of the predetermined_width of the housing due to its exterior_transmission outside of the front and intermediate_body_regions of the housing
thus since the device no longer must accommodate the sweep width of the scanning beam the invention allows a narrowing of the body of the device with a corresponding reduction in overall size and weight

ii
infringement
opticons first contention on appeal is that symbol presented insufficient evidence during its case-in-chief to establish a prima facie showing of infringement
symbol as the party asserting infringement bore the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence
hughes aircraft co. v. united_states 717_f.2d_1351 1361 219_uspq_473 480 fed.cir.1983

to prove infringement symbol offered the expert_testimony of mr. edward barkan barkan named as a co-inventor in each of the three patent applications
the court admitted into evidence charts and drawings used by barkan to demonstrate infringement of the asserted claims each of which contains` means plus function' limitations as permitted under 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
6 1988
the charts show each asserted claim broken down by limitation with one or more numbers placed next to each limitation
corresponding numbers identify various structural parts of the accused devices depicted in the drawings
using the exhibits as a guide barkan stated that in his opinion each numbered claim_limitation reproduced on the charts was met by the corresponding numbered structure of the device shown on the drawings
furthermore barkan testified that his` understanding of the patent claims [ was ] based upon the claims as well as the specifications as well as statements made during the prosecution_history'

determination of patent infringement is a two-step process` the meaning of the claims must be learned from a study of all relevant patent documents ; and the claims must be applied to the accused structures'
caterpillar tractor co. v. berco s.p.a. 714_f.2d_1110 1114 219_uspq_185 187 fed.cir.1983
opticon contends that under pennwalt corp. v. durand-wayland inc. 833_f.2d_931 934 4_uspq2d_1737 1739 fed.cir.1987 cert
denied 485_u.s._961 108_s.ct._1226 99_l.ed.2d_426_(1988) a party asserting infringement of claims with` means plus function' limitations must demonstrate to the fact-finder how each structure in the accused device asserted to meet a functional claim_limitation is the same as or equivalent to a corresponding structure disclosed in the specification
opticon cites the following passage from pennwalt for support where the issue is raised it is part of the ultimate burden of proof of the patent owner to establish with respect to a claim_limitation in means-plus-function form that the structure in the accused device which performs that function is the same as or an equivalent of the structure disclosed in the specification
id

in the circumstances of this case however fed.r.evid
705 provides the answer to whether symbol made a prima facie *1575 showing of infringement.2 at trial symbol suggested that the court receive the exhibits representing barkans expert_testimony without foundation thus relieving the court and barkan of the need to` go through lengthy_testimony explaining with each infringing device how he found that each element was infringed'
counsel for opticon responded` i really have no objection except.. that we have wanted to voir dire'
after voir dire opticon failed to cross-examine barkan on the issue that it now asserts fatally flaws the sufficiency of his testimony

by its express terms ¡± 112 ?
6 permits an element in a claim to be expressed as a means or step for performing a specified function
however the scope of such a claim is not limitless but is confined to structures expressly disclosed in the specification and corresponding equivalents
thus the statutory_provision prevents an overly broad claim construction by requiring reference to the specification and at the same time precludes an overly narrow construction that would restrict coverage solely to those means expressly disclosed in the specification
johnston v. ivac corp. 885_f.2d_1574 1580 12_uspq2d_1382 1386-87 fed.cir.1989 statutory_provision acts as restriction on claim scope ; data line corp. v. micro technologies inc. 813_f.2d_1196 1201 1_uspq2d_2052 2055 fed.cir.1987 statutory_provision precludes a construction limited to structures expressly disclosed in specification ; d.m.i. inc. v. deere & co. 755_f.2d_1570 1574 225_uspq_236 238 fed.cir.1985 statutory_provision requires that` limitation shall be construed to cover structure described in the specification and equivalents thereof' emphasis in original
in short applying a claim drafted under ¡± 112 ?
6 to an accused structure is not a simple task

opticon argues that barkan must have misunderstood this task because he testified on the ultimate_issue of infringement without discussing in detail equivalency between the structures of the accused devices and the structures disclosed in the patent specifications
however testimony on the ultimate_issue of infringement is permissible in patent cases

704

6 is a factual determination

denied 475_u.s._1016 106_s.ct._1197 89_l.ed.2d_312_(1986)
the responsibility for challenging the factual underpinnings of the testimony fell squarely on opticon during cross-examination
see smith v. ford motor co. 626_f.2d_784 793 10th cir.1980 cert
denied 450_u.s._918 101_s.ct._1363 67_l.ed.2d_344_(1981)`the full burden of exploration of the facts and assumptions underlying the testimony of an expert_witness [ is ] squarely on the shoulders of opposing counsels cross-examination` citation omitted ; see also bryan v. fmc_corp. john bean div. 566_f.2d_541 545 5th cir.1978` rule 705 shifts to the cross-examiner the burden of eliciting the bases of an expert_witness opinion' ; united_states v. santarpio 560_f.2d_448 454-55 1st cir.1977 cert

opticon failed to seize the opportunity provided by the rule to demonstrate that barkans opinion_testimony was factually incorrect

rule 705 functions to abbreviate trials by permitting opinion_testimony without factual foundation
we see no reason why rule 705 is not fully applicable to patent trials and opinion_testimony on infringement of claims under ¡± 112 ?
6
we have not directly addressed this issue but have previously applied rule 705 in a patent case on the issue of damages stating that an expert need not` reveal the facts or data underlying his opinion.. because [ the defendant ] did not cross-examine on this issue and the master did not require otherwise'
studiengesellschaft_kohle v. dart indus. 862_f.2d_1564 1567 9_uspq2d_1273 1277 fed.cir.1988
moreover the federal rules of evidence are expressly applicable to all proceedings in the courts of the united_states which must include civil suits arising under title 35
fed.r.evid
101
finally the specific purpose behind rule 705 is to avoid` complex and time consuming' testimony by permitting an expert to`state his opinion and reasons without first specifying the data upon which it is based
`` fed.r.evid
705 advisory committees note quoting rule 4515 n.y. cplr mckinney 1963
patent cases so often typified by lengthy_testimony on complex technical issues are particularly served by this purpose

in short symbol was permitted to rest its prima_facie_case on barkans expert_testimony including charts that the patents were infringed and the district_court was free to accept or reject that evidence
of course by resting its case on summary testimony symbol was left exposed to a profound risk that opticon during its defense or cross-examination of barkan would demonstrate that the accused devices were non-infringing under a different and proper construction of the claims
opticon willingly permitted symbol to bear this risk but chose not to expose barkans testimony to the glaring light of cross-examination on this issue
having lost below opticon can not here recoup for its failed litigation strategy.3 in view of the legal effect of the expedited procedure we must reject opticons contention that symbol failed to present a prima_facie_case of infringement
since opticon offers no argument that its products do not infringe on the facts we need not review infringement itself

iii
validity
a. obviousness
opticon challenges the district_courts conclusion that the inventions of the297 and186_patent s were not proved invalid for obviousness under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 19884 we must answer whether` the prior_art made obvious the invention as a whole for which patentability is claimed'
hartness int l inc. v. simplimatic eng g co. 819_f.2d_1100 1108 2_uspq2d_1826 1832 fed.cir.1987
we do not` pick and choose among the individual elements of assorted prior_art_references to recreate the claimed invention' but rather we look for` some teaching or suggestion in the references to support their use in the particular claimed combination'
smithkline_diagnostics inc. v. helena laboratories corp. 859_f.2d_878 887 8_uspq2d_1468 1475 fed.cir.1988

*1577 the district_court found that the prior_art consisted of u.s. patent no._4251,798 the798_patent which describes the laserchek and references which describe the laserscan the verifier 315 the monitor 101 and the carton_counter
we review here the teachings of that art

the798_patent is prior_art under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 e 1988
the798_patent claims a portable_laser_scanning_head that detects and decodes laser_beams reflected from bar_codes
the reference discloses a device that can read in a non-contact position thisdepth of field feature permits a user to scan bar_code_symbols imprinted both on a flat surface and on a curved surface merely by moving the head towards a position anywhere within 2¡² of the symbol
'798_patent col. 5 line 66-col. 6 line 6

during prosecution of the297_patent the798_patent was the basis for discussions about the permissible scope of the297_patent claims
indeed the examiner originally rejected the claimed invention as obvious in light of the disclosure in the798_patent
following an interview with the examiner the applicants amended the claims to include the handle trigger and sighting_means that appear in claim 1 and are quoted above
the examiner allowed the claims in view of the amendment
the district_court agreed with the examiners conclusion that the addition of the handle trigger and sighting_means described by the district_court as the` aim and shoot' feature to the self-scanning means distinguished the invention claimed in the297_patent from the disclosure in the798_patent

the laserchek_device a symbol product is described in the798_patent
following a demonstration of the device at trial the district_court found that the laserchek was a bar_code verification device had no trigger normally blocked the users view of the bar_code during use and could not be used in the` aim and shoot' fashion

the laserscan was merely a modified version of the laserchek
the laserscan consisted of the laserchek scanning head attached to a console in turn attached to a computer
the district_court found that the laserscan was not capable of functioning in` aim and shoot' mode because the device had no trigger and obscured the bar_code during use

the verifier 315 was a bar_code_reader designed to be used with its feet resting on a surface and its front reading` snout' positioned above the bar_code by a small fixed distance
the district_court found that the device blocked the users view of the bar_code during use and had no trigger

the monitor 101 was developed in the mid-1970s to verify the accuracy of bar_codes as they are printed
during printing the bar_codes pass underneath the device which is fixed above the printing press
the district_court found that the monitor 101 was neither hand held nor capable of operating in` aim and shoot' fashion

the carton_counter counted cartons and was not a bar_code_reader
however the device had a trigger not to initiate decoding of a bar_code but to reset the counter to zero
a brochure describing the carton_counter was before the examiner and found not to be pertinent
the district_court finding that the carton counter` is not self-scanning ; rather it must be dragged over the carton edges' concluded that the device` lacks any disclosure recognition or teaching of an aim and shoot device'
17 uspq2d at 1746

the district_court thus concluded that the invention would not have been obvious in light of the prior_art because the considered references did not disclose or suggest the` aim and shoot' feature claimed in parts c d h and i of claim 1 of the297_patent
we agree
here the very difference between the claims and the considered art is the` aim and shoot' feature found critical to the patentability of the invention
graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 17-18 86_s.ct._684 693-94 15_l.ed.2d_545 148_uspq_459 467 1966 ¡± 103 requires consideration inter alia of differences between prior_art and claimed invention as a whole
thus a person of ordinary skill in the art having all of the *1578 teachings of the considered references before him would have found no` teaching or suggestion in the references' of the invention claimed in the297_patent
smithkline_diagnostics 859 f.2d at 887 8 uspq2d at 1475

however in reaching its conclusion the district_court excluded sketches and tentative_specifications relating to a device known as the x-scanner on the theory that`prior_art in an obviousness determination [ ] must.. be enabling that is disclose the disseminated subject_matter to the public in a manner such that one skilled in the art could make and operate such a device'
17 uspq2d at 1740
while a reference must enable someone to practice the invention in order to anticipate under ¡± 102 b a non-enabling reference may qualify as prior_art for the purpose of determining obviousness under ¡± 103
reading & bates constr co. v. baker energy resources corp. 748_f.2d_645 652 223_uspq_1168 1173 fed.cir.1984 reference that lacks enabling disclosure is not anticipating but` itself may qualify as a prior_art_reference under ¡± 103 but only for what is disclosed in it' emphasis in original ; see beckman instruments inc. v. lkb produkter ab 892_f.2d_1547 1551 13_uspq2d_1301 1304 fed.cir.1989` [ e ] ven if a reference discloses an inoperative device it is prior_art for all that it teaches'
undisputed evidence demonstrated that the sketches and tentative_specifications together known as the x-scanner_reference were publicly available more than one year before the effective filing date
the district_courts finding to the contrary is clearly erroneous
while the district_court clearly erred in excluding the x-scanner sketches and tentative_specifications from the prior_art for the purpose of evaluating obviousness under ¡± 103 that error did not preclude the district_court from alternatively reaching its factual conclusions regarding those materials
the district_court specifically stated in pertinent_part that` the x-scanner had to be dragged across the symbol rather than being aimed and shot'
17 uspq2d at 1747

the x-scanner_reference discloses a 2 lb
laser scanning head for reading bar_code_symbols at a maximum working range of 4¡² from the bar_code
thus like the798_patent the reference discloses a device capable of reading in a non-contact position
the disclosed device has a trigger and may be used in either` portable_mode' or` permanent_mount_mode'
when operated in permanent_mount_mode the device scans continuously from a fixed position above the bar_code much like the verifier 315 already considered
the reference explains that the device when operated in portable_mode has a` 0-2 seconds scan duration' which is activated by a` trigger'
in both modes the laser_beam puts out an` x' pattern and the` [ s ] ymbol must move across [ the scanning ] field or vice versa'

in support of its conclusion that the x-scanner had to be dragged across the symbol rather than aimed and shot the district_court cited the expert_testimony of symbols expert_witness mr. swartz
swartz testified that the x-scanners` mode of use' was sufficiently different from the invention of the297_patent that it was` not a device that is used in a shoot_mode [ ] because it is it creates an x-pattern as shown'
therefore to obtain a reading` [ y ] ou can not do it stationary you must have relative motion [ between the symbol and device ]'
swartz also stated` [ y ] ou would have to move [ the scan head ] you could not use it in aim and shoot_mode'
opticons evidence to the contrary failed to persuade the district_court and opticon has failed to persuade us that the district_court committed reversible_error in crediting symbols evidence on this point

the obviousness inquiry conducted by the district_court correctly included review of the evidence offered on the objective indicia of nonobviousness stratoflex inc. v. aeroquip corp. 713_f.2d_1530 1538 218_uspq_871 879 fed.cir.1983 which included the failure of others to develop the claimed invention and its commercial success
nonobviousness is suggested by the failure of others to` find a solution to the problem which the patent [ s ] in question purport [ ] to solve
such evidence *1579 shows indirectly the presence of a significant defect [ in the prior_art ] while serving as a simulated laboratory test of the obviousness of the solution to a skilled artisan'
note subtests of` nonobviousness' a nontechnical approach to patent validity 112_u.pa.l.rev._1169 1173 1964
on this issue the district_court found that opticons own expert_witness mr. collins was` closely involved with the bar_code industry since its inception and [ ] never conceived or developed an aim and shoot scanning device'
17 uspq2d at 1747
the court further found that despite years of effort opticons technical witness mr. knowles was` never able to develop a scanner with the aim and shoot feature of the patents in suit'
id
furthermore as found by the district_court symbols` aim and shoot' scanners have enjoyed tremendous commercial success with about 200,000 devices sold for over $ 150,000,000 as of the time of trial
these findings are not challenged by opticon

in short under the evidence that was put forward by symbol and properly accepted by the court the omitted reference adds nothing to the scope of the already considered prior_art except a trigger in a bar_code_reader
this addition is minor because the carton_counter already discloses a trigger although in a device for counting cartons
when the x-scanner_reference is considered with all the other references the prior_art as a whole still lacks a disclosure or suggestion of the` aim and shoot' feature in which a laser_beam sweeps laterally across the bar_code while the hand-held device is held stationary and the target can be viewed

we thus conclude that even when the x-scanner_reference is included in the prior_art opticon has not met its burden of proving that the inventions of the297 and186_patent s would have been obvious under ¡± 103
the district_courts error in alternatively excluding the x-scanner_reference from the prior_art was therefore harmless

b
double patenting
opticon challenges the district_courts conclusion that the186_patent was not invalid for obviousness-type_double_patenting over the297_patent
after the examiner required restriction during prosecution of the297_patent the applicants filed a divisional_application containing method_claims drawn to the invention of the originally non-elected group_vi_claims
a continuation of the divisional containing both the old method and new apparatus_claims eventually issued as the186_patent

with regard to double_patenting we recently explained that 35 u.s.c.¡± 121 1988 5 will not apply to remove the parent as a reference where the principle of consonance is violated

consonance requires that the line of demarcation between the` independent and distinct inventions' that prompted the restriction_requirement be maintained
though the claims may be amended they must not be so amended as to bring them back over the line imposed in the restriction_requirement
where that line is crossed the prohibition of the third sentence of section 121 does not apply
gerber_garment technology inc. v. lectra systems inc. 916_f.2d_683 688 16_uspq2d_1436 1440 fed.cir.1990
the corollary to this courts statement in gerber_garment is that new or amended claims in a divisional_application are entitled to the benefit of ¡± 121 if the claims do not cross the line of demarcation drawn around the invention elected in the restriction_requirement
if that line is crossed the issue is whether the invention claimed in the186_patent would have been obvious in light of the invention claimed in the297_patent

*1580 opticon contends as it did before the trial_court that the appearance of` a whole new group of apparatus_claims along with the method_claims' in the186_patent proves that the claims` asserted against opticon are drawn to the elected species of the297_patent and not the species upon which the divisional was filed'
we read opticons bare assertions in its opening brief without record citation to allege that because the group_vi_invention was described as a` method' in the restriction_requirement the added apparatus_claims fail to comply with the requirement
the district_court had before it the declaration of mr. berger which fully supports a conclusion that both the method and apparatus_claims are directed to the group_vi_invention
berger stated that the group_vi_invention is a system of scanner plus decoder with a means for stopping the scanner after the symbol is successfully decoded
therefore whether method or apparatus all the186_patent claims are drawn to that system
berger further asserted that in the electronic arts the patent and trademark_office pto has not restricted between claims to an apparatus and to a method of using the apparatus
cf
studiengesellschaft_kohle v. northern_petrochemical_co. 784_f.2d_351 354 228_uspq_837 840 fed.cir.1986 cert
dismissed 478_u.s._1028 106_s.ct._3343 92_l.ed.2d_763_(1986) chemical composition claims defined invention different from process claims
in short berger explained that the word` method' in the description of group_vi during restriction did not mean that the claims were limited to a method but was merely a short-hand description of the invented_system
for support berger stated that the examiner collectively characterized the method and apparatus_claims of another non-elected group group iv as a` method'
finally berger noted that the examiners statement that` the group i invention does not require the particular apparatus of group.. vi' emphasis added can not be reconciled with opticons argument that the invention of group_vi could only be expressed as a method
in light of this testimony we can not agree that a breach of the restriction_requirement occurred
the safeguard of ¡± 121 therefore applies in this case and the297_patent is not available as a reference against the186_patent

furthermore even if there had been a breach of the restriction_requirement we would reject opticons argument on the ultimate obviousness-type_double_patenting_inquiry whether the claims of the186_patent are patentably distinct from the claims of the297_patent
see in re borah 354_f.2d_1009 1017 148_uspq_213 220 ccpa 1966 crux of obviousness-type_double_patenting_inquiry lies in comparison of claims ; see also gerber_garment 916 f.2d at 686 16 uspq2d at 1438 judicially created doctrine of obviousness-type_double_patenting applies when two applications or patents not drawn to precisely the same invention are` drawn to inventions so very much alike as to render one obvious in view of the other and to effectively extend the life of the patent that would have the earlier of the two issue dates'

double patenting is an affirmative defense
studiengesellschaft_kohle v. northern_petrochemical_co. 784 f.2d at 352 228 uspq at 838
opticon was therefore required to prove double_patenting by clear and convincing evidence a heavy and unshifting burden
rca corp. v. applied digital data sys. inc. 730_f.2d_1440 1444 221_uspq_385 387 fed.cir.1984 invalidity requires clear and convincing proof and burden remains at all times with patent challenger ; carman indus. inc. v. wahl 724_f.2d_932 940 220_uspq_481 487 fed.cir.1983` [ t ] here is a heavy burden of proof on one seeking to show double_patenting'

opticons conclusory allegation that the district_courts decision on double_patenting was in error without citation to the record the patents or the testimony of the witnesses does not support reversal
see in re mulder 716_f.2d_1542 1550 219_uspq_189 197 fed.cir.1983 to obtain reversal appellant must clearly explain why decision below is wrong
as a court of review it is not our function to search the voluminous trial record prosecution histories and patents to fashion a substantive *1581 basis for opticons argument
see preemption devices inc. v. minnesota mining & mfg co. 732_f.2d_903 905 221_uspq_841 842 fed.cir.1984 as appellate court it is not our function to search the record in order to reach a conclusion favoring appellant

nevertheless even a brief review of the297_patent reveals that all of the asserted claims are directed to a laser self-scanning head with a` trigger' a` handle' and means for` sighting the symbol along a direct_line of sight'
in contrast the asserted claims of the186_patent recite additional features
although the claims of the186_patent cover a laser_scanning_system that includes a portable_laser_scanning_head the system also includes means for repetitively self scanning a bar_code_symbol until it is decoded
furthermore when successful_decoding has been achieved the system alerts the user and automatically stops scanning
the repetitive_scan feature adds the advantage of increasing the accuracy of decoding
claim 8 includes a further feature of terminating the repetitive_scan if no successful_decode is achieved within a set time period

opticon contends in its reply brief that the automatic termination feature is merely an obvious addition to the invention claimed in the297_patent because its expert testified that this feature` is a software_program essentially a software_program or firmware program if you go back far enough in time'
the mere reference to` a software_program' does not demonstrate that the program would have been obvious or that its addition to the invention of the297_patent would have been obvious

furthermore the policy behind the double_patenting doctrine the prevention of unlawful extension of the patent grant does not favor opticons position
although the297_patent will expire before the186_patent the186_patent will not` extend' the property right conveyed in the297_patent
see gerber_garment 916 f.2d at 686 16 uspq2d at 1438 obviousness-type_double_patenting occurs when a second patent would` effectively extend the life of the patent that would have the earlier of the two issue dates'
since the186_patent is not infringed by practice of the invention claimed in the297_patent the world will be free to use the invention of the297_patent once it expires
see in re kaplan 789_f.2d_1574 1578 229_uspq_678 681-82 fed.cir.1986 no double_patenting found where no extension of patent right is possible because when the first to issue patent expires` the world will be free to use' the first patented invention so long as the second patented invention is not used in it

finally opticon contends that the judgment of the district_court should be reversed for failure to state findings of fact under fed.r.civ.p
52 a
on appeal opticon raises the issue of consonance
as this court explained in gerber_garment` [ t ] he presence or absence of consonance will necessarily depend upon analysis of the involved claims' 916 f.2d at 688 16 uspq2d at 1441 which are construed as a matter of law
cf
interconnect planning corp. v. feil 774_f.2d_1132 1138_n._3 227_uspq_543 547_n._3_(fed.cir.1985)` under this courts precedent substantial identity between claims a matter of claim_interpretation is a question of law`
in connection with construing claims we are free to examine the prosecution_history on appeal even where the trial_court erroneously fails to consider it
see lemelson v. united_states 752_f.2d_1538 1550 224_uspq_526 532-33 fed.cir.1985
this is particularly so where as here there are no underlying findings of fact required for such construction
because we have concluded that the claims of the186_patent are within the subject_matter of group_vi as a matter of law the absence of rule 52 a findings of fact on this issue is not reversible_error

we thus conclude that opticon has failed to demonstrate that the district_court erred in finding that no claim in the186_patent was proved invalid for double_patenting

iv
enforceability
opticon challenges the district_courts conclusion that neither the *1582297_patent nor the186_patent are unenforceable because of inequitable_conduct during prosecution
opticon reiterates its argument considered and rejected below that symbol fraudulently withheld information from the examiner concerning the verifier 315 and the laserscan during prosecution of the297 and186_patent s

opticon asserts that the district_court erroneously failed to consider references that symbol` should have known' were material citing fmc_corp. v. manitowoc co. 835_f.2d_1411 1415 5_uspq2d_1112 1116 fed.cir.1987
however we have repeatedly rejected the simple negligence standard that opticon urges us to adopt
see e.g. jaskiewicz v. mossinghoff 822_f.2d_1053 1058 3_uspq2d_1294 1299 fed.cir.1987` [ m ] ere negligence is not sufficient to infer fraud or dishonesty'
moreover even a finding of gross negligence does not of itself justify an inference of intent to deceive ; the involved conduct viewed in light of all the evidence including evidence indicative of good faith must indicate sufficient culpability to require a finding of intent to deceive
kingsdown medical consultants v. hollister inc. 863_f.2d_867 876 9_uspq2d_1384 1392 fed.cir.1988 cert
denied 490_u.s._1067 109_s.ct._2068 104_l.ed.2d_633_(1989)

opticon asserts that a flyer submitted by symbol during reexamination depicted an operational verifier 315 and that symbol deceived the pto by indicating that the flyer depicted only an empty_shell or housing
the record is replete with evidence supporting a conclusion that at the very least symbol possessed a good faith belief that the photograph in the flyer indeed depicted only an empty_shell of an inoperable device a belief to which the district_court in the final analysis itself concurred
opticon further argues that symbol improperly withheld from the examiner information relating to the laserscan device during prosecution of its patents but as noted supra that device was a modified version of the laserchek_device disclosed in the798_patent
we conclude that the reference was merely cumulative to the teachings of the798_patent imparting no obligation to disclose
see j.p. stevens & co. v. lex tex ltd. 747_f.2d_1553 223_uspq_1089 1092 fed.cir.1984 cert
denied 474_u.s._822 106_s.ct._73 88_l.ed.2d_60_(1985)` [ a ] reference that would have been merely cumulative is not material'

we find no abuse of discretion in the district_courts conclusion that the297 and186_patent s were not proved unenforceable for inequitable_conduct during prosecution

v. conclusion
among other issues opticon alleges that the sparseness of the district_courts rule 52 findings particularly on infringement and double_patenting preclude effective appellate review
our opinion amply demonstrates the absence of merit in that allegation
having duly considered and rejected each of opticons other arguments we affirm the judgment of the district_court

affirmed
