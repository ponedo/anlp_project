synopsis
background owners of patents for automatically animating the lip_synchronization and facial_expressions of three-dimensional animated characters brought infringement actions and cases were consolidated
the united_states_district_court for the central_district of california george h. wu j. 55_f.supp.3d_1214 granted defendants motion for judgment on the pleadings on unpatentability
patent owners appealed

holdings the court of appeals reyna circuit_judge held that

`` first_set of rules' in patents were limited to rules evaluating sub-sequences consisting of multiple_sequential_phonemes

patent claims were limited to rules with specific common characteristics i.e. genus rather than covering all rules ; and

patent claim was not directed to abstract_idea and did not merely invoke generic_processes and machinery thus favoring patentability

reversed and remanded

i
background
a
factual background
the576_patent and the278_patent were both issued to maury rosenfeld and are both titled` method for automatically animating lip synchronization and facial expression of animated characters'
the278_patent is a continuation of the576_patent and shares the same written description

1
admitted prior art
the patents relate to automating part of a preexisting 3-d animation method
as explained in the background of the patents the admitted prior_art_method uses multiple 3-d models of a characters face to depict various facial_expressions made during speech
see generally576_patent col. 1_l._14 to col. 2_l._37
to animate the character as it speaks the method morphs the characters expression between the models
the` neutral_model' is the 3-d representation of the resting neutral facial_expression of an animated character
the other models of the characters face are known as` morph_targets' and each one represents that face as it pronounces a phoneme i.e. makes a certain sound
this visual representation of the characters face making a sound is also called a` viseme'
mcro_br
7
an example morph_target for the` ahh' phoneme is shown below
each of these morph_targets and the neutral_model has identified points called` vertices' in certain places on the face
the set of differences in the location of these vertices and the corresponding point on the face between the neutral_model and the morph_target form a` delta_set' of vectors representing the change in location of the vertices between the two models
for each morph_target there is a corresponding_delta_set consisting of the vectors by which the vertices on that morph_target differ from the neutral_model

*1304. ?
defs
br
8.1
facial expressions are described as a function of the amount each morph_target and its corresponding_delta_set is applied to modify the character_model
`` in producing animation products a value usually from 0_to_1 is assigned to each delta_set by the animator and the value is called themorph_weight
``576_patent col. 1_ll._63 -65
the set of morph_weights for all the delta_sets is called a` morph_weight_set'
the neutral_model is represented by a morph_weight_set with all morph_weights of 0
a desired morph_target is represented by the morph_weight of 1 for that morph_targets delta_set and a morph_weight of 0 for all other delta_sets

the power of this prior_art animation method is in generating intermediate faces by using morph_weights between 0_and_1 to blend together multiple morph_targets
for example the face halfway between the neutral_model and the` oh' face can be expressed simply by setting the` oh' morph_weight to 0.5 i.e. 50 % as shown below at the left
the model halfway to the next_syllable in turn could be expressed by setting both the` oh' morph_weight and that for the next_syllable each to 0.5 creating a blend of those two delta_sets
mcro_br
11 ; see also defs
br
8-11
for each morph_weight_set the resulting facial_expression is calculated by determining the displacement of each vertex from the neutral_model as the product of the morph_weights in the morph_weight_set and the corresponding_delta_sets for the morph_targets

animation of the character and lip_synchronization preexisting the invention was generally accomplished by an animator with the assistance of a computer
animators used` akeyframe approach where the artist set [ ] the appropriate [ morph ] weights at certain important timeskeyframes' instead of at every frame
'576_patent col. 2_ll._31 -33
animators knew what phoneme a character pronounced at a given time from a` time aligned phonetic transcription'` timed transcript'
this listed the` occurrence in time' of each phoneme the character pronounced as shown in the example below
id.at_col. 1_ll._32 -34

*1306. ?
mcro_br
7
animators using a computer manually determined the appropriate_morph_weight_sets for each keyframe based on the phoneme timings in the timed transcript
`` for each keyframe the artist would look at the screen and relying on her judgment manipulate the character_model until it looked right-a visual and subjective process'
mcro reply br
4 emphasis removed ; defs
br
10` using the [ timed transcript ] the animator would decide what the animated face should look like at key_points in time between the start and end_times and thendraw the face at those times`
because the pronounced phoneme and drawn keyframe corresponded in time this prior_art_process synchronized the lips and facial_expression of the 3-d character
a computer program would then interpolate between the keyframes set by the animator creating the intermediate frames by determining the appropriate_morph_weight_sets at intermediate points in time simply based on continuously transitioning between the keyframes
'576_patent col. 2_ll._32 -36

2
claimed invention
the patents criticize the preexisting keyframe approach as` very tedious and time consuming as well as inaccurate due to the large number of keyframes necessary to depict speech'
'576_patent col. 2_ll._35 -37
they suggest the
present invention overcomes many of the deficiencies of the prior_art and obtains *1307 its objectives by providing an integrated method embodied in computer_software for use with a computer for the rapid efficient lip_synchronization and manipulation of character facial_expressions thereby allowing for rapid creative and expressive animation products to be produced in a very cost effective manner
id.at_col. 2_ll._38 -44
`` accordingly it is the primary object of this invention to provide a method for automatically.. producing accurate and realistic_lip_synchronization and facial_expressions in animated characters'
id.at_col. 2_ll._45 -50

essentially the patents aim to automate a 3-d animators tasks specifically determining when to set keyframes and setting those keyframes
this automation is accomplished through rules that are applied to the timed transcript to determine the morph_weight outputs
the patents describe many exemplary rule sets that go beyond simply matching single phonemes from the timed transcript with the appropriate morph_target
instead these rule sets aim to produce more realistic speech by` tak [ ing ] into consideration the differences in mouth positions for similar phonemes based on context'
id.at_col. 10_ll._6 -7

one exemplary_set of rules provided and applied in the specification of the576_patent is for a character transitioning from silence through saying` hello'
see576_patent col. 7_l._36 to col. 9_l._22
this exemplary_set of rules provides for inserting a transition starting shortly before the first_syllable after a silence
id.at_col. 8_ll._24 -28
the transition marks when the character begins to transition from silence shown by the closed-mouthed neutral_model to the morph_target for the first_syllable with its open-mouthed shape
id.at_col. 8_ll._61 -63
that is the rule automates a characters facial_expressions so the character will wait until shortly before it starts speaking to begin opening its mouth
in terms of the prior_art_method the effect of this rule is to automatically create a keyframe at a point that no phoneme is being pronounced
id.at_col. 9_ll._10 -11
if instead no transition were placed at that position the resulting animation would have an unrealistic quality
the character would open its mouth gradually from the beginning of the sequence through its first utterance as a result of the computer interpolating a continuous transition between those two points
in the prior_art system an animator would have to subjectively identify the problematic sequence and manually fix it by adding an appropriate keyframe
the invention however uses rules to automatically set a keyframe at the correct point to depict more realistic speech achieving results similar to those previously achieved manually by animators

claim 1 of the576_patent is representative and dispositive of the asserted claims3 for the purposes of appeal a method for automatically animating lip_synchronization and facial_expression of three-dimensional_characters comprising obtaining a first_set of rules that define output_morph_weight set stream as a *1308 function of phoneme_sequence and time of said phoneme_sequence ; obtaining a timed data file of phonemes having a plurality of sub-sequences ; generating an intermediate_stream of output_morph_weight_sets and a plurality of transition_parameters between two adjacent morph_weight_sets by evaluating said plurality of sub-sequences against said first_set of rules ; generating a final_stream of output_morph_weight_sets at a desired frame rate from said intermediate_stream of output_morph_weight_sets and said plurality of transition_parameters ; and
applying said final_stream of output_morph_weight_sets to a sequence of animated characters to produce lip_synchronization and facial_expression control of said animated characters

procedural history
in 2012_and_2013 plaintiff-appellant mcro inc. d/b/a planet blue` mcro' filed lawsuits in the u.s. district courts for the central_district of california and for the district of delaware
the defendants are generally video game developers and publishers
on january 15 2014 eight of the lawsuits originally filed in delaware were transferred to the central_district of california
the five cases remaining in delaware are not part of this appeal but are stayed pending the resolution of this appeal.4

the central_district of california` district_court' consolidated the proceedings there for pre-trial purposes on two tracks.5 it held a claim_construction hearing in the track 1 cases on april_29,_2014 and issued its rulings on claim construction on may_1,_2014
j.a
4009 4155-73.6

c. district courts ¡± 101 ruling
on july_10,_2014 all central_district of california defendants from both tracks` defendants' jointly filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings that the asserted claims were directed to patent_ineligible_subject_matter under ¡± 101
patentability_op. 55 f.supp.3d at 1216
after a hearing the district_court granted the motion on *big_token__1309_september_22__big_token 2014 finding the asserted claims unpatentable
id.at 1230

the district_courts analysis loosely tracks the two-step_framework laid out by the supreme court in alice corp. v. cls bank int l -- - u.s. -- -- 134_s.ct._2347 2355 189_l.ed.2d_296_(2014)` alice'
first the district_court discussed the claims generally` facially these claims do not seem directed to an abstract_idea
they are tangible each covering an approach to automated three-dimensional computer animation which is a specific technological_process'
patentability_op. 55 f.supp.3d at 1224
`` at first blush it is therefore difficult to see how the claims might implicate the basic underlying concern that these patents tie up too much future use of any abstract_idea they apply'
id
( quotation_marks omitted

second the district_court attempted to` factor out conventional_activity' by comparing the claims to the admitted prior_art_process that the patent sought to improve
id.at 1224
the court accepted as undisputed that` a central part of the patents isusing morph_weight_set representations of the facial shape coupled with rules.. to generate keyframes
`` id.at 1226
the court then looked to` whether the inclusion of that concept in the claims satisfies ¡± 101 given 1 the prior_art and 2 the fact that the claims do not require any particular_rules'
id

after looking at each claim element in turn the district_court concluded` the claim adds to the prior_art.. the use of rules rather than artists to set the morph_weights and transitions between phonemes'
id.at 1227
nonetheless the district_court found the claims too broadly preemptive to satisfy ¡± 101
in the district_courts view because the claims were not limited to specific_rules,7 but rather` purport to cover all such rules' the claims merely call for application of the abstract_idea of using rules
id.at 1227 citing alice 134 s.ct.at 2358
the district_court found that` while the patents do not preempt the field of automatic_lip_synchronization for computer-generated 3d animation they do preempt the field of such lip_synchronization using a rules-based morph_target approach'
id.at 1227
the court concluded that the claims were unpatentable because` the novel portions of [ the ] invention are claimed too broadly'
id.at 1230

the district_court entered judgment against mcro on october 31 2014

parties arguments
the parties principal dispute is over the meaning and application of two supreme court cases in light of alice parker v. flook 437_u.s._584 98_s.ct._2522 57_l.ed.2d_451_(1978)` flook' and diamond v. diehr 450_u.s._175 101_s.ct._1048 67_l.ed.2d_155_(1981)` diehr'
both cases addressed the patentability of process claims that include steps requiring calculation

a. mcros position
mcro argues that diehr controls the outcome here and dictates that the claims are not directed to an abstract_idea
specifically mcro argues that the claims are not directed to an abstract_idea because they generate a tangible_product namely` a video of a 3-d character speaking the recorded audio'
mcro_br
38
according to mcro the claimed process is technological because it provides` a method for getting a computer to automatically generate *1310 video of a 3-d animated character speaking in sync with pre-recorded dialogue-without requiring an artists constant intermediation'
mcro_br
42

mcro argues that even if we find the claims are directed to an abstract_idea they are nonetheless patent eligible because they` effect an improvement in [ a ] technology or technical field' specifically 3-d computer generated lip-synchronization
mcro_br
43 quoting alice 134 s.ct.at 2359 citing diehr 450 u.s. at 177-78 101_s.ct._1048
this improvement mcro argues results from its method that` employs specific types of rules' and uses those rules in` a specific technological way'
mcro_br
45 emphasis in original
the claimed type of rules are only those` rules that define output_morph_weight set stream as a function of phoneme_sequence and time of said phoneme_sequence'
id.at 46 quoting576_patent cl
1 col. 11_ll._30 -32
when applied in mcros interpretation these rules must` adjust for the fact that a phoneme may look different when spoken depending on the phonemes preceding and/or following it'
mcro_br
46

these limitations are specific enough in mcros view because the rules will necessarily vary by character as for example` a swamp monster will use different rules than a tight-lipped cat'
id.at 46
mcro argues that its claims can not preempt the field because other techniques exist that automate facial synchronization by capturing actors facial motions and applying those motions to 3-d animated characters

b
defendants position
defendants argue that flook controls because the claims are unpatentable algorithms that` can be performed solely with pencil and paper'
defs
br
28
the claims in defendants view` merely purport to take a preexisting process and make it faster by automating it on a general-purpose computer'

defendants argue that these claims fail even under diehr because they do not result in any tangible_product instead only producing a` stream of output_morph_weight_sets' that are applied` to produce lip_synchronization' without requiring the production of anything tangible like a video
'576_patent claim 1 col. 11_ll._44 -47 ; defs

discussion
a
claim interpretation
as an initial matter we note that in this case claim_construction is helpful to resolve the question of patentability under ¡± 101
specifically the parties dispute about whether the` first_set of rules' must evaluate sequential phonemes or can evaluate individual_phonemes is resolved by the claim_language
we agree with mcro that the claims are limited to rules that evaluate sub-sequences consisting of multiple_sequential_phonemes
this limitation is apparent on the face of the claims
see phillips v. awh corp. 415_f.3d_1303 1314 fed
cir
2005 en banc
in particular the intermediate morph_weight_sets and transition_parameters are generated` by evaluating said plurality of sub-sequences against said first_set of rules'
'576_patent cl
1 col. 11_ll._36 -39.10 this limitation could not be satisfied by rules that only evaluate individual_phonemes
instead the claimed` first_set of rules' must be formulated to evaluate sub-sequences of phonemes.11

b. patentability under ¡± 101
section 101 defines patent eligible subject_matter as` any new and useful process machine manufacture or composition of matter or any new and useful improvement thereof' subject to the other limitations of the patent_act
apart from the patent_act the courts have created exceptions to the literal scope of ¡± 101

this appeal involves the abstract_idea_exception

in alice the court applied a two-step_framework for analyzing whether *1312 claims are patent eligible
first we determine whether the claim at issue is` directed to' a judicial exception such as an abstract_idea
alice 134 s.ct.at 2355
mathematical formulas are a type of abstract_idea
gottschalk v. benson 409_u.s._63 64 93_s.ct._253 34_l.ed.2d_273_(1972)` benson'
the abstract_idea_exception prevents patenting a result where` it matters not by what process or machinery the result is accomplished'
o'reilly v. morse 56 u.s. 15 how
62 113 14_l.ed._601_(1854)

cir
2015
if the claims are not directed to an abstract_idea the inquiry ends
if the claims are` directed to' an abstract_idea then the inquiry proceeds to the second step of the alice framework

in step two we consider whether the claims contain an` inventive concept' sufficient to` transform the nature of the claim into a patent-eligible application'
alice 134 s.ct.at 2355 quotation omitted
to do so we look to both the claim as a whole and the individual claim elements to determine whether the claims contain` an element or combination of elements that issufficient to ensure that the patent in practice amounts to significantly more than a patent upon the [ ineligible concept ] itself

( quoting mayo 132 s.ct.at 1294 alteration in original

in alice the court applied some of its ¡± 101 jurisprudence that preceded the two-step_framework including flook and diehr
in flook claims requiring the use of a specific equation were unpatentable because they` simply provide [ d ] a new and presumably better method of calculating alarm limit values'
flook 437 u.s. at 594-95 98_s.ct._2522
the mathematical` formula itself was an abstract_idea' and` the computer implementation was purely conventional' because` theuse of computers for` automatic monitoring-alarming` waswell known'
alice 134 s.ct.at 2358 quoting flook 437 u.s. at 594 98_s.ct._2522

specific limitations
the district_court determined that claim 1 of the567_patent is` drawn to the [ abstract ] idea of automated rules-based use of morph_targets and delta_sets for lip-synchronized three-dimensional animation'
patentability_op. 55 f.supp.3d at 1226
we disagree
we have previously cautioned that courts` must be careful to avoid oversimplifying the claims' by looking at them generally and failing to account for the specific requirements of the claims
tli_commc'ns 823 f.3d at 611 ; see also diehr 450 u.s. at 189 n.12 101_s.ct._1048
here the claims are limited to rules with specific characteristics

whether at step one or step two of the alice test in determining the patentability of a method a court must look to the claims as an ordered combination without ignoring the requirements of the individual steps
the specific claimed features of these rules allow for the improvement realized by the invention

as the specification confirms the claimed improvement here is allowing computers to produce` accurate and realistic_lip_synchronization and facial_expressions in animated characters' that previously could only be produced by human animators
'576_patent col. 2_ll._49 -50
as the district_court correctly recognized this computer automation is realized by improving the prior_art through` the use of rules rather than artists to set the morph_weights and transitions between phonemes'
patentability_op. 55 f.supp.3d at 1227
the rules are limiting in that they define morph_weight_sets as a function of the timing of phoneme sub-sequences
see e.g.576_patent col. 3_ll._19 -33
defendants do not dispute that processes that automate tasks that humans are capable of performing are patent eligible if properly claimed ; instead they argue that the claims here are abstract because they do not claim specific_rules.12 this argument echoes the district_courts finding that the claims improperly purport to cover all rules
patentability_op. at 1227
the claimed rules here however are limited to rules with certain common characteristics i.e. a genus

claims to the genus of an invention rather than a particular species have long been acknowledged as patentable
e.g. diamond v. chakrabarty 447_u.s._303 305 100_s.ct._2204 65_l.ed.2d_144_(1980) patentable claim to` a bacterium from the genus pseudomonas containing therein at least two stable energy-generating plasmids each of said plasmids providing a separate hydrocarbon degradative pathway`
patent law has evolved to place additional requirements on patentees seeking to claim a genus ; however these limits have not been in relation to the abstract_idea_exception to ¡± 101
rather they have principally been in terms of whether the patentee has satisfied the *1314 tradeoff of broad disclosure for broad claim scope implicit in 35 u.s.c.¡± 112
e.g. carnegie mellon univ
v. hoffmann-la roche inc. 541_f.3d_1115 1122 fed
cir
2008
it is self-evident that genus claims create a greater risk of preemption thus implicating the primary concern driving ¡± 101 jurisprudence but this does not mean they are unpatentable

the preemption concern arises when the claims are not directed to a specific invention and instead improperly monopolize` the basic tools of scientific and technological work'
alice 134 s.ct.at 2354 quoting myriad 133 s.ct.at 2116
the abstract_idea_exception has been applied to prevent patenting of claims that abstractly cover results where` it matters not by what process or machinery the result is accomplished'
morse 56 u.s. at 113 ; see also mayo 132 s.ct.at 1301
`` a patent is not good for an effect or the result of a certain process' because such patents` would prohibit all other persons from making the same thing by any means whatsoever'

a patent may issue` for the means or method of producing a certain result or effect and not for the result or effect produced'
diehr 450_u.s._175 182 n.7 101_s.ct._1048
we therefore look to whether the claims in these patents focus on a specific means or method that improves the relevant technology or are instead directed to a result or effect that itself is the abstract_idea and merely invoke generic_processes and machinery

claims directed to
claim 1 of the576_patent is focused on a specific asserted improvement in computer animation i.e. the automatic use of rules of a particular type
we disagree with defendants arguments that the claims simply use a computer as a tool to automate conventional_activity
while the rules are embodied in computer_software that is processed by general-purpose computers defendants provided no evidence that the process previously used by animators is the same as the process required by the claims
see defs
br
10-15 39-40
in support defendants point to the background section of the patents but that information makes no suggestion that animators were previously employing the type of rules required by claim 1
defendants concede an animators process was driven by subjective determinations rather than specific limited mathematical rules
the prior_art` animator would decide what the animated face should look like at key_points in time between the start and end_times and thendraw the face at those times'
defs
br
10
the computer here is employed to perform a distinct process to automate a task previously performed by humans
mcro states that animators would initially set keyframes at the point a phoneme was pronounced to represent the corresponding morph_target as a starting point for further fine tuning
j.a
3573_at_853 mcros claim construction presentation
this activity even if automated by rules would not be within the scope of the claims because it does not evaluate sub-sequences generate transition_parameters or apply transition_parameters to create a final morph_weight_set
it is the incorporation of the claimed rules not the use of the computer that` improved [ the ] existing technological_process' by allowing the automation of further tasks
alice 134 s.ct.at 2358
this is unlike flook bilski and alice where the claimed computer-automated process and the prior method were carried out in the same way
flook 437 u.s. at 585-86 98_s.ct._2522 ; *1315 bilski 561 u.s. at 611 130_s.ct._3218 ; alice 134 s.ct.at 2356

further the automation goes beyond merely` organizing [ existing ] information into a new form' or carrying out a fundamental economic practice
digitech 758 f.3d at 1351 ; see also alice 134 s.ct.at 2356
the claimed process uses a combined order of specific_rules that renders information into a specific format that is then used and applied to create desired results a sequence of synchronized animated characters
while the result may not be tangible there is nothing that requires a method` be tied to a machine or transform an article' to be patentable
bilski 561 u.s. at 603 130_s.ct._3218 discussing 35 u.s.c.¡± 100 b
the concern underlying the exceptions to ¡± 101 is not tangibility but preemption
mayo 132 s.ct.at 1301

the limitations in claim 1 prevent preemption of all processes for achieving automated lip-synchronization of 3-d characters
mcro has demonstrated that motion capture animation provides an alternative process for automatically animating lip_synchronization and facial_expressions
even so we have recognized that` the absence of complete preemption does not demonstrate patent_eligibility'
ariosa_diagnostics inc. v. sequenom inc. 788_f.3d_1371 1379 fed
cir
2015
the narrower concern here is whether the claimed genus of rules preempts all techniques for automating 3-d animation that rely on rules
claim 1 requires that the rules be rendered in a specific way as a relationship between sub-sequences of phonemes timing and the weight to which each phoneme is expressed visually at a particular timing as represented by the morph_weight_set
the specific structure of the claimed rules would prevent broad_preemption of all rules-based means of automating lip_synchronization unless the limits of the rules themselves are broad enough to cover all possible approaches.13 there has been no showing that any rules-based lip-synchronization_process must use rules with the specifically claimed characteristics

defendants attorneys argument that any rules-based lip-synchronization_process must use the claimed type of rules has appeal but no record evidence supports this conclusion
defendants again rely only on the patents description of one type of rules but the description of one set of rules does not mean that there exists only one set of rules and does not support the view that other possible types of rules with different characteristics do not exist
the only information cited to this court about the relationship between speech and face shape points to the conclusion that there are many other possible approaches to automating lip_synchronization using rules
for example amicus cites kiyoshi honda physiological processes of speech processing in springer handbook of speech production 7 jacob benesty et al
eds. 2008` honda' as support for the proposition that the claimed rules reflect natural laws
amicus_public_knowledge_br
12
honda shows however that the interaction between vocalization and facial_expression is very complex and there are relationships present other than those required by the claimed rules
honda at 24` physiological processes during speech are multidimensional in nature as described in this chapter`
this complex interaction permits development of alternative rules-based methods of animating lip_synchronization and facial_expressions of three-dimensional_characters such as simulating the muscle action underlying *1316 characters facial_expressions
under these circumstances therefore we need not assume that future alternative discoveries are foreclosed

here the structure of the limited_rules reflects a specific implementation not demonstrated as that which` any [ animator ] engaged in the search for [ an automation process ] would likely have utilized'
myriad 133 s.ct.at 2119-20 quotation_marks omitted
by incorporating the specific features of the rules as claim limitations claim 1 is limited to a specific process for automatically animating characters using particular information and techniques and does not preempt approaches that use rules of a different structure or different techniques
see morse 56 u.s. at 113
when looked at as a whole claim 1 is directed to a patentable technological improvement over the existing manual 3-d animation techniques
the claim uses the limited_rules in a process specifically designed to achieve an improved technological result in conventional_industry_practice
alice 134 s.ct.at 2358 citing diehr 450 u.s. at 177 101_s.ct._1048
claim 1 of the576_patent therefore is not directed to an abstract_idea

claim 1 is not directed to an abstract_idea and recites subject_matter as a patentable process under ¡± 101

the parties do not argue that any of the district_courts constructions affect patent_eligibility or contest the constructions arrived at by the district_court

the limitation with the same effect in independent claim 1 of the278_patent is` applying said first_set of rules to each sub-sequence' at column 11_lines_53 -54

the parties also dispute whether the rules must take into account the pacing of speech based on the` and time of said phoneme_sequence' limitation
resolution of this question is neither necessary to resolve of the issues on appeal nor indisputably resolved by the claim_language
we therefore decline to address this issue in the first instance and express no opinion on whether mcro has waived these arguments or is bound by them for purposes of infringement

see e.g. hearing tr.at 14:00-15:09 defendants counsel acknowledging that a process for autopilot or facial recognition using rules could be patented but arguing the claims here are unpatentable because they do not claim specific_rules available at http //oralarguments.cafc.uscourts.gov/default.aspx ? fl=2015-1080.mp3
13
this is not a case where the patentees principal contribution was in discovering relationships that existed in nature e.g. myriad 133 s.ct.at 2112 ; animators were previously able to naturally depict the relationship between speech timing and facial_expression
