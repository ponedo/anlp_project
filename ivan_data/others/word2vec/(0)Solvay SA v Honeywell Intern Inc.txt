plaintiff solvay_s.a.` solvay' appeals from a judgment of the united_states_district_court for the district of delaware in favor of defendant honeywell international` honeywell'
the district_court held that asserted claim 1 of solvays u.s. patent no._6730,817` the ¡¬817_patent` was invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 g 2 2006
this was so because engineers working at the russian_scientific_center for applied_chemistry` rscac' first conceived the invention which was reduced to practice in this country by honeywell_personnel pursuant to the rscacs instructions and did not abandon suppress or conceal it

background
i
the question at the heart of this appeal is when an invention conceived by a foreign_inventor and reduced to practice in the united_states qualifies as prior_art *1000 under ¡± 102 g 21 that section provides` [ a ] person shall be entitled to a patent unless.. before such persons invention thereof the invention was made in this country by another inventor who had not abandoned suppressed or concealed it'
35 u.s.c.¡± 102 g 2
although section 102 g initially was designed for determining priority of invention in interference_proceedings it is settled that the section has` independent significance as a basis for prior_art outside of the interference context'
thomson s.a. v. quixote corp. 166_f.3d_1172 1175_n._3_(fed.cir.1999) ; see also solvay v. honeywell international inc.` solvay_i` 622_f.3d_1367 1375-76 fed.cir.2010
a patent is invalid under that section if the claimed invention was made in this country by another inventor before the patents priority_date
see e.g. solvay_i 622 f.3d at 1375_n._3 describing 1999 amendments to ¡± 102 g
making the invention requires conception and reduction to practice
while conception is the` formation in the mind of the inventor of a definite and permanent idea of a complete and operative invention' reduction to practice` requires that the claimed invention work for its intended purpose'
id.at 1376 citing hybritech inc. v. monoclonal antibodies inc. 802_f.2d_1367 1376 fed.cir.1986
it is also necessary that the invention not be suppressed abandoned or concealed
see e.g. apotex usa inc. v. merck & co. 254_f.3d_1031 1036 fed.cir.2001

our prior cases have illuminated what is meant by` made in this country'
see e.g. solvay_i 622 f.3d at 1376 citing mycogen plant sci. inc. v. monsanto co. 243_f.3d_1316 1331 fed.cir.2001 ; apotex 254 f.3d at 1036
although the inventors may reside in a foreign_country and conceive the invention abroad a reduction to practice made outside the united_states is beyond the scope of ¡± 102 g 2 prior_art
in other_words ¡± 102 g 2 allows conception to occur in another country but in such_circumstances requires the work constituting the reduction to practice to be performed in the united_states by or on behalf of the inventor.2 however` there is no requirement that the inventor be the one to reduce the invention to practice so long as the reduction to practice was done on his behalf' in the united_states
in re debaun 687_f.2d_459 463 ccpa 1982 citing litchfield v. eigen 535_f.2d_72 76 ccpa 1976
consistent with that principle` [ a ] cts by others working explicitly or implicitly at the inventors request will inure to his benefit'

here honeywell contends that the invention was conceived by russian_inventors outside the united_states and reduced to practice in the united_states by honeywell *1001 personnel following the russian_inventors instructions before the ¡¬817_patents priority_date
it follows argues honeywell that the invention qualifies as ¡± 102 g 2 prior_art

solvays ¡¬817_patent claims an improvement to a method of making a hydrofluorocarbon` hfc' known as hfc-245fa.3 ¡¬817_patent_col. 1_ll._4 -5
hfc-245fa belongs to a group of hfcs that do not deplete the ozone layer and for that reason are legislatively mandated to replace ozone-depleting alternatives
hfc-245fa is especially useful in preparing polymeric materials commonly used for insulation in refrigeration and heat storage systems
the ¡¬817_patent has a priority_date of october 23 1995

in 1994 before solvays priority_date honeywell and rscac personnel entered into a research contract
pursuant to that agreement rscac_engineers working in russia conducted process development studies for the commercial production of hfc-245fa
in july 1994 the rscac sent honeywell a report documenting the development of a continuous process capable of producing high yields of hfc-245fa by reacting hcc-240fa4 with hydrogen_fluoride in the presence of a catalyst
honeywell_personnel in the united_states used the rscacs report to run the same process in this country in 1995 before the ¡¬817_patents october priority_date.5

solvay sued honeywell in the district of delaware alleging that the process honeywell was using to manufacture hfc-245fa infringed certain claims of the ¡¬ 817 patent
independent claim 1 the only_claim at issue on appeal reads in a process for the preparation of [ hfc-245fa ] comprising reaction of [ hcc-240fa ] with hydrogen_fluoride in the presence of a hydrofluorination_catalyst the improvement which comprises carrying out the reaction at a temperature and under a pressure at which [ hfc-245fa ] is gaseous and isolating.. [ hfc-245fa ] from the reaction_mixture by drawing off [ hfc-245fa ] and hydrogen chloride [ hcl ] in a gaseous_phase as each of said [ hfc245fa ] and [ hcl ] is being formed
¡¬817_patent col. 5_ll._36 -46

honeywell defended inter alia on the ground that independent claim 1 and dependent claims 5 7 10 and 11 of the ¡¬817_patent were invalid under ¡± 102 g 2
honeywells initial theory was that its engineers had reduced the invention to practice in the united_states and that this made the honeywell engineers inventors under ¡± 102 g 2

in 2008 the district_court construed the` isolating' limitation in claim 1 to read the process for making hfc-245fa includes a reaction at a temperature and under a pressure whereby hfc-245fa and hcl are produced in gaseous_form and separated from the reaction_mixture in a gas_stream that can include other_compounds such as unconverted_reactants and chlorofluoropropanes possibly formed by incomplete_fluorination of hcc-240fa
*big_token__1002_j.a._4_ emphasis_added __big_token
the district_court thus construed` isolating' to require` separating' hfc-245fa and hcl from the reaction_mixture
id
it did not require separating only those components from the reactor
id
based on that claim_construction the district_court ruled on summary_judgment that honeywells process infringed claims 1 5-7 10 and 11
however the district_court granted summary_judgment of invalidity as to claims 1 5 7 10 and 11 under ¡± 102 g 2 on the ground that the honeywell engineers were other inventors who made the invention in this country without abandoning suppressing or concealing it.6

the district_courts judgment was appealed to this court
on appeal we agreed with the district_courts claim_construction of the term` isolating' in claim 1 explaining that` claim 1 is not limited toisolating only hfc-245fa and hcl and residual amounts of other_compounds'
solvay_i 622 f.3d at 1382
we affirmed the district_courts ruling on summary_judgment that claims 1 5 7 10 and 11 were infringed
however we reversed the finding that claims 1 5 7 10 and 11 were invalid under ¡± 102 g 2 explaining that honeywell_personnel could not qualify as` another inventor' because they` did not conceive the invention of the ¡¬817_patent but derived it from others' specifically the rscac_engineers who` first conceived the invention in russia'
id.at 1378-79

on remand honeywell asserted an alternative theory as to why ¡± 102 g 2 applied arguing that the russian_inventors made the invention in this country by sending instructions to honeywell_personnel who used the instructions to reduce the invention to practice in this country
the parties did not dispute the fact that under the district_courts claim_construction the rscac_process corresponded to the invention recited in claim 1 of the ¡¬817_patent or that the rscac_engineers first conceived the invention and reduced it to practice in russia
but the parties disputed whether 1 the honeywell reduction to practice should be attributed to the russian_inventors and 2 whether the russian_inventors had disclosed the invention rather than abandoning suppressing or concealing it
although the district_court held that as a matter of law the rscac_engineers should be treated as inventors who made the invention in the united_states under ¡± 102 g 2 it denied summary_judgment on the invalidity of claim 1 because of genuine issues of material fact as to whether the rscac_engineers disclosed their invention in a 1994 russian_patent_application rather than abandoning suppressing or concealing it

eventually a jury determined that as required by ¡± 102 g 2 the rscac did disclose the invention of claim 1 in the 1994 russian_patent_application such that they did not abandon suppress or conceal it
based on the jury_verdict the district_court entered judgment for honeywell finding asserted claim 1 invalid under ¡± 102 g 27 solvay appealed
we have *1003 jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

discussion
i
the priority_date for solvays ¡¬817_patent is october 23 1995
the parties do not dispute that if the russians conceived the invention and reduced it to practice in this country before that date without abandoning suppressing or concealing it claim 1 of solvays ¡¬817_patent is invalid under ¡± 102 g 2
on appeal solvay does not dispute that the russians were first to conceive the invention recited in claim 1 or that honeywell reduced it to practice in this country before solvays october 23 1995 priority_date but challenges 1 the jurys finding of nonsuppression and 2 the district_courts ruling that the russians made the invention in this country

as to the first issue solvay argues that the district_court erroneously construed claim 1 and that the resulting instructions tainted the jurys finding that the russians disclosed the invention in a 1994 russian_patent_application and therefore did not suppress or conceal it
in other_words solvay argues that the application did not satisfy ¡± 102 g 2 because the application did not disclose the full scope of the claims if they were properly construed
before addressing the merits of solvays claim_construction contention we consider whether solvay has waived its objection by failing to request in the district_court the construction it now advocates

a
the general rule is that` an appellate court does not give consideration to issues not raised below'
hormel v. helvering 312_u.s._552 556 61_s.ct._719 85_l.ed._1037_(1941) ; see also singleton v. wulff 428_u.s._106 120 96_s.ct._2868 49_l.ed.2d_826_(1976)
the doctrine of waiver` has been applied to preclude a party from adopting a new claim_construction position on appeal'
interactive gift express inc. v. compuserve inc. 256_f.3d_1323 1346 fed.cir.2001
a claim_construction argument is considered` new' if a party` change [ s ] the scope of the claim_construction' rather than` clarifying or defending the original scope of its claim_construction' or` supporting its existing claim_construction position with new citations to the specification'
id

according to solvay claim 1 requires that hfc-245fa and hcl be removed from the reaction_mixture permanently so that the hfc-245fa and hcl are not recycled back into the reactor
claim 1 reads in a process for the preparation of [ hfc-245fa ] comprising reaction of [ hcc-240fa ] with [ hf ] in the presence of a hydrofluorination_catalyst the improvement which comprises carrying out the reaction at a temperature and under a pressure at which [ hfc-245fa ] is gaseous and isolating.. [ hfc-245fa ] from the reaction_mixture by drawing off [ hfc-245fa ] and [ hcl ] in a gaseous_phase as each of said [ hfc-245fa ] and [ hcl ] is being formed
¡¬817_patent_col. 5_ll._36 -46 emphasis added

when this case was first appealed this court upheld the district_courts construction of the term` isolating' in claim 1 of the ¡¬817_patent to mean` drawing off' or` separating' hfc-245fa and hcl from the reaction but not necessarily` purifying' the drawn-off material
solvay_i 622 f.3d at 1382
as a result the gas_stream conveying hfc-245fa from the reactor can include other_compounds from the reaction_mixture not only hfc-245fa and hcl
the parties did not raise and this court did not address the issue of whether the *1004 hfc-245fa and hcl could return to the reactor after being drawn off initially

near the end of the validity trial however a disagreement between the parties arose as to whether the reaction_products had to be permanently isolated from the reaction_mixture
solvay argued that` isolating' the reaction_products necessarily required keeping them separated
in response honeywell argued that requiring permanent separation contradicted the district_courts claim_construction affirmed by this court as well as the plain language of the claim

the district_court held that based on claim language specification references and this courts construction of the term` isolating' the reaction_products did not have to be permanently isolated from the reaction_mixture
the court granted honeywells request for a standard jury_instruction that the term` comprising' means that` the claim is not limited to a process that includes only what is in the claim and nothing else'
j.a
49
at trial honeywell argued that the ¡¬817_patent could read on processes in which hfc-245fa and hcl return to the reaction_mixture through additional_steps after the initial_separation

solvay contends that the district_courts instruction reflected an erroneous interpretation of` isolating'
according to solvay if given the correct interpretation` the jury might well have found that the russian application did not disclose solvays invention' because in the rscac_process some gaseous hfc-245fa condenses back into a liquid and drips back into the reaction_mixture after the initial_separation
reply_br
34

the problem is that solvay did not ask the district_court to modify the claim_construction or accompanying jury_instruction to require` isolating' to mean` isolating permanently'
when the issue surfaced at trial it was raised by honeywell in response to solvays questioning of its expert witness
honeywell argued that solvay was attempting to make improper claim_construction arguments to the jury
in response solvay insisted that the isolating limitation necessarily implied permanence notwithstanding the ambiguity that the disagreement between the parties made apparent
the district_court which had not previously been asked to consider the issue of permanence asked the parties to submit briefs on the issue
solvay in its brief still did not request any modification or clarification of the claim_construction` reassert [ ing ] that it agree [ d ] with the courts proposed construction'
j.a
5263
because solvay failed to object to the courts construction or jury_instruction with respect to the term` isolating' 8 it waived the issue and can not now raise novel arguments to redefine the scope of claim 1
see lizardtech inc. v. earth res
mapping inc. 424_f.3d_1336 1341 fed.cir.2005 a party that` agreed to the district_courts construction at the time.. can not [ on appeal ] argue against that claim_construction simply because it resulted in an adverse ruling'9

b
even if the claim_construction issue had been properly raised we see no *1005 error in the district_courts construction
claim construction is a question of law reviewed de novo
cybor corp. v. fas techs. inc. 138_f.3d_1448 1451 fed.cir.1998
the conclusion that` isolating' means` separating' and therefore does not preclude additional_steps that could occur after the initial isolation is consistent with the claims and specification
claim 1 of the ¡¬817_patent uses the transitional_term` comprises' to define the bounds of the patented improvement
see ¡¬ 817 patent col. 5 l.40
the well-established meaning of`comprising in a method claim indicates that the claim is open-ended and allows for additional_steps'
invitrogen corp. v. biocrest mfg. l.p. 327_f.3d_1364 1368 fed.cir.2003 citing vivid techs. inc. v. am
sci
& eng g inc. 200_f.3d_795 811 fed.cir.1999

we agree with the district_court that nothing in the claims or specification overcomes the well-established meaning of` comprises' as a transitional_term allowing for additional_steps
solvay supports its position by pointing to a portion of the specification stating that` [ i ] t is advantageous to separate the [ hfc-245fa ] and the [ hcl ] from the reaction_mixture as they are being formed and to keep in or return to the reactor the unconverted_reactants as well as the chlorofluoropropanes possibly formed by incomplete_fluorination of [ hcc-240fa ]'
¡¬817_patent_col. 2_l._64 to col. 3_l._2
on its face the statement pertains to recycling_reactants not reaction_products and does not expressly or impliedly preclude recycling reaction_products to the reaction_mixture as well

solvay attempts to buttress its argument by pointing out that the reference in the specification corresponds to a statement in the ¡¬817_patents prosecution history that purportedly` shows that the isolation limitation was intended to distinguish' the invention from the prior_art specifically the ¡¬ 192 patent
reply_br
32
according to solvay it amended claim 1 to avoid rejection in view of the ¡¬192_patent and thus explained to the examiner that its invention` enables [ hfc-245fa ] to be easily separated from the reaction_mixture which is an advantage as it makes it possible to retain or to return to the reactor the unconverted_reactants and [ products of incomplete_fluorination ]'
j.a
8364
as with the specification reference the statement pertains only to recycling_reactants and incomplete reaction_products and does not require hfc245fa or hcl to be isolated once and for all time when they first leave the reaction_mixture in gaseous_form
it does not follow that distinguishing a process on the basis of the continuous removal of reaction_products also requires such removal to be permanent
continuous removal pertains to the status of the reaction and does not connote or require permanence with respect to steps occurring after products are formed and removed while the reaction is still ongoing
we find no legal error in the courts claim_construction
under this claim_construction solvay does not on appeal contest that the russian_patent_application sufficiently disclosed the invention.10

ii
solvay urges that even under the district_courts claim_construction the requirements of ¡± 102 g 2 are not satisfied
solvay does not dispute that honeywell fully performed the rscacs process for making hfc-245fa in the united_states *1006 before the ¡¬817_patents october 1995 priority_date
nor is it disputed that under the district_courts claim_construction the rscac_process corresponds to the invention claimed by the ¡¬817_patent
instead solvay argues that 1 the doctrine of inurement defining when the activities of others inure to the benefit of the inventor controls the question of whether honeywells work can be attributed to the rscac_engineers and 2 the undisputed_facts do not establish inurement because the rscac_engineers did not expressly ask the honeywell researchers to perform the inventive_process

assuming that the inurement doctrine governs inurement does not require that the inventor expressly request or direct the non-inventor to perform reductive_work
to be sure no inurement can arise from a third_partys` unwarranted and hostile use' of anothers invention burgess v. wetmore 1879 dec. comm r pat
237 240 no inurement of reduction to practice built by rival applicant but an express request or direction is not required
the request may be` implicit [ ]'
cooper v. goldfarb 154_f.3d_1321 1332 fed.cir.1998
in hogue v. cowling 26_ccpa_874 101_f.2d_541 542 544 550 1939 a third_partys reduction to practice inured to the benefit of the inventor who disclosed his idea for a` confection making apparatus' to the manager of a popsicle company and suggested that the latter sketch the invention
the manager did not merely make a sketch but built and tested a working device believing he was` acting in accordance' with the inventors wishes
id.at 550
the inventor knew nothing about the third_partys work but was still able to claim it as his own to establish the priority of his invention

similarly in learned v. thompson 39_c.c.p.a._730 191_f.2d_409 410-11 415 1951 an inventor benefited from work performed by a third_party with whom he had no direct communication
the inventor learned disclosed his invention and offered it to the united_states government which then turned the disclosure over to an employee who reduced the invention to practice
id.at 410-11
the employee even filed his own_patent_application for improvements he made although he later abandoned that application in the first_inventors favor
id.at 410
the court treated the reduction to practice as the inventors because he had given` authorization to the government' to use his invention
id.at 415
the inventors authorization was sufficient even though he never asked the government or its employee to reduce the invention to practice nor supervised the reductive_work

in kendall v. searles 36_c.c.p.a._1045 173_f.2d_986 992 1949 as with honeywell and the rscac fafnir and westinghouse had a` joint program of development'
the inventor an official at fafnir conceived the invention and communicated his conception to westinghouse which conducted tests necessary to establish the inventors reduction to practice and the priority of his invention
id.at 991-92
although it appears that the inventor did not have` anything to do with the tests conducted by westinghouse' those tests were held to inure to his benefit
id.at 992

thus our case law does not support solvays contention that an inventor must make an express directive or request to benefit from a third_partys reduction to practice
rather inurement exists if the inventor authorizes another to reduce his invention to practice
here the research agreement between the rscac and honeywell confirms that the rscac authorized honeywell to practice its invention in the united_states and contemplated that honeywell would do so
the contract *1007 stated that` rscac will assist [ honeywell ] in the development of manufacturing processes for hydrofluorocarbon compounds hfcs.. or hydrofluorocarbon ethers hfc ethers'
j.a
3355
pursuant to that agreement honeywell promised to provide yearly compensation information and equipment while the russians agreed to produce 1,000 kg of hfc-245fa develop production processes and send regular reports to honeywell detailing their results and progress
while title and rights to inventions would belong to honeywell the rscac could make use and sell those inventions in russia
the collaborative research arrangement between honeywell and the rscac thus parallels the joint development program in kendall 173 f.2d at 992

solvay does not suggest that the rscac did not intend for honeywell to use the information it sent or that it did not authorize honeywell to reproduce the process it described
the undisputed_facts show that the rscac authorized honeywell to practice its invention and specifically contemplated that it would do so under the companies joint research agreement aimed at developing commercial processes for the production of hfc-245fa
the rscac_engineers gave honeywell_personnel the information they needed to perform the inventive_process in this country in july 1994 and honeywell relied on that information in so doing
as we noted in our earlier decision` in early 1995 honeywell replicated the russian_process by following the information provided by rscac thereby practicing the invention in the united_states before the ¡¬817_patents priority_date'
solvay_i 622 f.3d at 1374 emphasis added

solvay argues that there can be no inurement here because honeywell independently benefited from performing the rscac_process
solvay in particular points to honeywells subsequent filing of its own_patent_application and notes that in burgess the existence of a rival patent_application was held in part to defeat inurement
but learned shows that the mere filing of a related patent_application does not in itself preclude inurement
here the russians applied for and received a patent in russia while honeywell filed a patent_application in the united_states
the parties did not view these applications as rivals providing that honeywell was entitled to exclusive rights to inventions resulting from the collaboration while the russians were entitled only to sublicenses

we therefore agree with the district_court that the process invented by the russian_engineers was made in this country when honeywell successfully performed the process because the russians authorized honeywell_personnel to practice the invention and specifically contemplated that they would do so.11 we affirm *1008 the district_courts judgment that the ¡¬817_patent is invalid under ¡± 102 g 212

affirmed

newman circuit_judge dissenting
the court today creates a new_class of secret_prior_art holding that a privately performed experiment without publication or public knowledge or use or sale or inclusion in a united_states_patent_application is invalidating` prior_art'
heretofore the role of secret_prior_art has been carefully circumscribed
the new general rule here adopted contravenes the policy and the letter of patent law wherein inventors are charged only with knowledge of what is known or knowable as defined by statute subject to special limited circumstances

the panel_majority holds that private secret activity-in this case honeywells evaluation of russian_technology that had been invented in russia and placed in an unpublished russian_patent_application-is` prior_art' against all others thereby invalidating the solvay_patent
the panel_majority does not recognize the unavailability of an interference contest for there is no united_states_counterpart to the russian_patent_application

in the prior_appeal of this case solvay_s.a. v. honeywell int l inc. 622_f.3d_1367 fed.cir.2010 solvay_i this court confirmed that the russian_invention was conceived and reduced to practice in russia and that honeywells repetition of the process in the united_states was not an invention made in the united_states
testing the invention of another is not an act of invention by the tester
this aspect was finally resolved in solvay_i the court describing honeywells work in the united_states as a` derivation' of the russian_invention
the matter was finally decided ; it is not open for redetermination

undaunted the panel_majority now rules that honeywells activity was a` reduction to practice' of the russian_process
the private/secret duplication of the prior_invention of another does not convert either that prior_invention or its duplication into prior_art
the issue here is not priority between the russian_invention and the solvay invention ; the issue is prior_art against the world

the honeywell_test of the russian_process was a private_experiment
no united_states_patent_application was filed on the russian_process not by honeywell and not by the russian_inventors
a private_experiment is not prior_art when it is not published nor used sold or otherwise made known nor included in a united_states_patent_application

the panel_majority concedes that the russian_process was conceived and reduced to practice in russia and placed in a russian_patent_application for which no corresponding united_states_application was filed
nonetheless the panel_majority holds that the russian_invention was` made in this country' maj. op.at 1007 because it was privately communicated to honeywell who tested it in this country
the panel_majority states that the honeywell_test` inured' to the benefit of the russians
however the russians had no united_states_patent_application that could benefit from` inurement' even if my colleagues had not created the theory for *1009 honeywell does not so state that honeywell performed this evaluation on behalf of the russian_inventors
my colleagues simply rule that due to` inurement' the secret honeywell_test converts the still secret russian_technology into` prior_art'

in the earlier appeal in this case the status of honeywells test of the russian_technology was established by final judgment as` derivation'
honeywells private testing did not convert the subject technology into prior_art
the courts new_class of secret_prior_art enlarges the situations in which unknowable private activity may serve to invalidate the independent inventions of third parties
from the confused and incorrect new law announced by the court i respectfully dissent

in the prior_appeal in this action the court considered honeywells status in the context of ¡± 102 g 2 since it is undisputed that honeywell did not originate the invention but reproduced it in the united_states by following rscacs instructions honeywell can not be said to have conceived of the invention and can not consequently be an inventor for purposes of ¡± 102 g 2
solvay_i 622 f.3d at 1378
the court decided unequivocally and finally that honeywell was not the inventor of the russian_technology
but rather derived it from rscac [ russian_scientific_center for applied_chemistry ] whose engineers invented it in russia
id.at 1374
these rulings are the law of this case
it is no longer before this court to attempt to treat the russian_technology as if it were invented in the united_states

also i must correct the courts erroneous statement concerning honeywells later-filed united_states_patent_application on its subsequent improvement and development of the russian_process
it is misleading to state that` the russians applied for and received a patent in russia while honeywell filed a patent_application in the united_states'
maj. op.at 1007
the honeywell patent_application was not on the russian_invention but on the later honeywell invention as explained in solvay_i throughout the summer of 1995 honeywell continued working to develop and perfect its process for the preparation of hfc-245fa
the work included finding optimum operating conditions for the process as well as designing and enabling downstream_purification of the hfc-245fa product
development of a pilot plant to test a commercially viable manufacturing process for hfc-245fa was begun by honeywell and the plant was in successful operation by february 1996
in march 1996 honeywell began drafting a patent_application on an improvement process for making hfc-245fa
the application was filed on july_3,_1996 and eventually issued as u.s._patent_no._5763,706` the ¡¬706_patent`
the ¡¬706_patent discloses a process for the continuous preparation of hfc-245fa using optimal conditions for downstream_purification so that the hfc-245fa recovered by distillation has a high purity at least about 99.5 %
see ¡¬706_patent col.1 l.60-col.2 l.25 ; col.4 ll.40-42
solvay_i 622 f.3d at 1372 citations omitted
my colleagues suggestion that this honeywell patent was the united_states_counterpart of the russian_patent_application or somehow converted honeywells evaluation of the russian_invention into` prior_art' against solvay and all others is untenable

the court in solvay_i resolved that the russian_invention was not made in the united_states
the panel_majority now *1010 concedes that the russian_process was conceived and reduced to practice in russia maj. op.at 1002 but states that` ¡± 102 g 2 allows conception to occur in another country but in such_circumstances requires the work constituting the reduction to practice to be performed in the united_states by or on behalf of the inventor'
maj. op.at 1000
this is incorrect on two fronts
first this court has never held that an invention conceived in a foreign_country is` made in this country' under ¡± 102 g 2
and second it was not shown that honeywells work in the united_states was` by or on behalf of' the russian_inventors
honeywell never so stated ; that is a postulate of the panel_majority

in priority contests between conflicting united_states_patent_applications under ¡± 102 g 1 reliance for priority has occasionally been authorized on activity conducted in the united_states on behalf of a foreign applicant
here there is no priority contest no united_states_patent_application and no domestic activity on behalf of a foreign_inventor
the cases cited by the panel_majority are inapplicable

the majority cites holmwood v. sugavanam for the thesis that a` foreign_inventor wasanother inventor under ¡± 102 g 2 when the invention was reduced to practice in the united_states on his behalf'
maj. op.at 1000_n._2
holmwood was an interference case under ¡± 102 g 1
section 102 g 2 was not at issue nor did the foreign_inventor claim to be` another inventor'
the majoritys citation is out of context for the case is not applicable to any of the issues before us

the other cases cited to support the ruling that honeywells private/secret activity in the united_states converted the russian_process into` prior_art' are all` interference' contests where united_states activity served as evidence of priority of invention
e.g. shurie v. richmond 699_f.2d_1156 1158 fed.cir.1983 evidence that the process in interference was performed on behalf of the inventor in the united_states ; scott v. koyama 281_f.3d_1243_(fed.cir.2002) evidence of disclosure in the united_states to show conception by a party to the interference ; tyler refrigeration corp. v. kysor industrial corp. 601_f.supp._590_(d.del.1985) affd on other grounds 777_f.2d_687_(fed.cir.1985) an actual reduction to practice in the united_states could be relied on by a foreign_inventor to support interference_priority

the panel_majoritys reliance on` inurement' is thus irrelevant for there is no united_states_application to which the honeywell experiment could inure
whether activity in the united_states can support a foreign_inventors interference_priority has no relation to whether that activity is prior_art against the world

the panel_majority insists that the russian_invention was merely conceived in russia and although reduced to practice in russia was also` reduced to practice' by honeywell in the united_states whereby the panel_majority concludes that the russian_invention was` made in this country'
maj. op.at 1007
not even honeywell made that argument and there was no evidence or argument that honeywells work was done at the request of and on behalf of the russians

the panel_majority makes much of the conclusion that the russians did not` abandon suppress or conceal' their invention
no one argued otherwise
however the unpublished unused unknown russian_invention contained in a russian_patent_application with no united_states_counterpart does not thereby become prior_art

*1011 unpublished private activity in a foreign_country is not prior_art
foreign inventions may of course be the subject of a united_states_patent and the benefit of a foreign filing date may be obtained in accordance with 35 u.s.c.¡± 119
here however there is no corresponding united_states_patent
the russian_patent_application filed on may_28,_1994 would according to russian law have been` laid open' eighteen months later on november 28 1995 after solvays priority_date of october 23 1995
whether or not honeywells work with the russian_process in the united_states` inured' to the russians it could not convert the unpublished russian application or its unpublished evaluation in the united_states into prior_art

the issue here is not whether honeywell has a personal_defense to infringement as the panel_majority states` we have repeatedly held that prior_invention by another is a defense to infringement'
maj. op.at 1007-big_token__08_n._11__big_token
the issue is whether the russian secret process became prior_art against the world when honeywell secretly reproduced it in the united_states

the checkpoint case relied on by the panel_majority is misapplied first because checkpoint confirms that ¡± 102 g relates to inventions` made in this country' and second because checkpoint on its facts offers no guidance here
in checkpoint the question was patent validity related to inventorship and the court stated citing ¡± 102 g that` checkpoint does not contest that kaltner completed the subject invention in this country'
checkpoint sys. inc. v. u.s._int l_trade_comm n 54_f.3d_756 761 fed.cir.1995
the court explained that` a first_inventor may seek to avoid a determination of abandonment by showing that he or she marketed or sold a commercial embodiment of the invention or described the invention in a publicly disseminated document' id.at 762 none of which is here asserted
the only possible relevance of checkpoint would be to show that the russian_invention was indeed abandoned by the russians in the united_states

the amgen and new idea decisions that the majority cites to support its flawed reliance on checkpoint concern inventions made in this country
in amgen the question was whether conception and reduction to practice occurred together or separately for dna sequence identification work done in this country
amgen inc. v. chugai_pharm co. ltd. 927_f.2d_1200 1205 fed.cir.1991
and new idea discussed the inventors work in this country stating that` burkharts testimony further showed that in early 1971 a prototype harvester was built with an arched tongue and a center pivot connection to the harvester'
new_idea_farm_equip corp. v. sperry_corp. 916 f.2d 1561 1566 fed.cir.1990
there was no issue of foreign invention

invalidation by secret_prior_art is disfavored
see oddzon prods. inc. v. just toys inc. 122_f.3d_1396 1402 fed.cir.1997` thus the patent laws have not generally recognized as prior_art that which is not accessible to the public
`` ; kimberly-clark corp. v. johnson & johnson 745_f.2d_1437 1446 fed.cir.1984 defining ¡± 102` prior_art' as` technology already available to the public' and stating that` secret_prior_art' may not be used to invalidate a patent under ¡± 102 g
the majoritys spin on ¡± 102 g takes` secret_prior_art' into unintended territory

there is no issue before us of whether honeywell might have a personal_defense against the solvay_patent ; the only issue is whether the secret honeywell_test of the unpublished russian_process is prior_art against the world
the courts ruling that prior_art includes secret information is of far-reaching potential impact
it is as unnecessary *1012 as it is inappropriate to so enlarge the scope of secret_prior_art

although the district_courts invalidity ruling did not include claim 6 the parties stipulated that claim 6 would be withdrawn and that solvay could reassert it if only if claims 1 5 7 10 and 11 were held not invalid
7
the jury also determined that claim 1 the only_claim asserted at trial was anticipated in view of u.s._patent_no._5574,192` the ¡¬ 192 patent' and obvious in view of the ¡¬192_patent and u.s._patent_no._5202,509
the district_court entered a judgment of invalidity on those grounds as well
in light of our disposition on appeal we need not reach these other issues
the parties do not explain why on remand only_claim 1 was the subject of the invalidity trial
it appears likely that the parties agreed that the remaining claims found to be infringed would stand or fall together with claim 1

solvay did not preserve the issue by objecting to the` comprising' instruction

at trial solvay asserted that the phrase` as each of said [ hfc-245fa ] and [ hcl ] is being formed' should have been added to the jury_instruction on claim 1

in its motion for a new_trial solvay did not renew that objection
the final jury_instruction on claim 1 was modified only slightly to include` continuously' and` or drawn off'

on appeal solvay concedes that` [ t ] his instruction is consistent with the claim limitation requiringisolati [ on ]'

on appeal there is no contention that disclosure of the reduction to practice was required
11
the dissent argues that the majority is improperly incorporating concepts from interferences into the infringement context and is allowing` secret_prior_art' to invalidate a patent
dissent at 1008-09 1011-12
the dissent is incorrect
we have repeatedly held that prior_invention by another is a defense to infringement
see e.g. checkpoint sys. inc. v. u.s._int l_trade_comm n 54_f.3d_756 761-62 fed.cir.1995` however ¡± 102 g is applicable in other contexts as well such as when it is asserted as a basis for invalidating a patent in defense to an infringement_suit'
( citing amgen inc. v. chugai_pharm co. 927_f.2d_1200 1203 fed.cir.1991 ; new_idea_farm_equip corp. v. sperry_corp. 916_f.2d_1561 1565 fed.cir.1990
the invention was described in the russian_patent_application
it is also established that ¡± 102 g requires that the prior inventor not` abandon suppress or conceal' his invention
see e.g. apotex 254 f.3d at 1037` a ¡± 102 g prior_invention defense is governed by the identicalsuppressed or concealed language applicable to priority determinations in interference_proceedings`
here the jury specifically found that the russian_inventors did not abandon suppress or conceal their invention a conclusion the dissent does not dispute
12
we need not consider the district_courts exclusion of statements made by an attorney prosecuting a patent for honeywell given solvays admission during oral argument that this issue has no bearing on invalidity under ¡± 102 g 2
