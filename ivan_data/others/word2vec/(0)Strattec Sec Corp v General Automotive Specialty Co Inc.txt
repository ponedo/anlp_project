background
in 1978 general motors corporation gm asked the allen-bradley company a-b to make a commercially manufacturable pellet resistor for mounting in the shank or long portion of the ignition keys to cars equipped with gms vehicle anti-theft system vats1 the vats_keys are designed so that a resistor mounted in the shank of the key will operatively engage an electrical_circuit when the key is inserted into a cars vats-equipped ignition system
the electrical_circuit includes an on-board computer that temporarily disables the cars electronic ignition system if the resistance value of the keys resistor does not match a predetermined value

in response to gms request a-b developed and patented a packaged resistor
a-bs patent the482_patent issued 10_february_1981 and is the subject of this lawsuit
although originally assigned to a-b the patent was assigned to plaintiff-appellee strattec on 27_february_1995
strattec is the original equipment supplier of the gm vats_keys currently used in gm cars

while strattecs vats_keys do incorporate a pellet resistor like that covered by the482_patent the patent itself is not directed to keys vats or otherwise and does not include the words` key'` ignition cylinder'` vehicle'` car'` automobile'` steering_column' or` vehicle anti-theft system'
the482_patent is directed to a resistor_assembly
according to the482_patents summary of invention the assembly comprises an electronic_chip encapsulated in a small package with runner-like_leads e.g. small enough to fit inside a standard gm ignition key
figure 3b from the482_patent illustrates the preferred_embodiment and is provided below

in the preferred_embodiment a sheet_metal lead frame 16 e.g. a perforated ribbon has internal termination pads 14_and_14 formed by a punching or stamping operation
an electronic_chip 13 such as a chip resistor or integrated circuit is soldered to the termination pads 14_and_14
this assembly is then over-molded with plastic 11 to produce the packaged component as depicted in fig.3d from the patent
the packaged component is subsequently separated from the sheet of metal and the exterior runner-like_leads 12_and_12 are simultaneously shaped by a trimming operation to produce the finished encapsulated component 10 shown in figures 1_and_2 of the patent

*1414. ?
the lead frame 16 thus conducts electricity supports the electronic_chip 13 and forms runner-like_leads 12_and_12
as used in strattecs vats key the encapsulated chip is inserted in a key_shank and mounted in a defined orientation so that a runner-like lead protrudes on each side of the shank

strattec filed this lawsuit on 6_april_1995 against general_automotive which had just introduced its own after-market vats key designed to work in gms vats-equipped cars
general_automotive has been in the business of after-market supply of replacement products such as switches and locks for many years
the product strattec accuses of infringing the482_patent is general_automotives complete vats key as shown below which includes a metal_key_blank a resistor_assembly and an over-molded plastic cover enclosing the head and part of the shank of the key blank as well as the entire resistor_assembly except for the contact areas

the resistor_assembly shown below comprises a molded plastic contact carrier a cylindrical_resistor with axial_leads and two contacts formed of bent round_wire
the contact carrier holds the resistor and its leads in their respective positions
each of the resistor leads is then wrapped around and soldered to an end of its respective contact wire

*1415. ?
-- -- -

during manufacture the resistor_assembly is placed in an opening in the metal_key_blank
the opening is located mainly in the head portion of the key and extends part way down the key_shank
the entire head of the key as well as the resistor_assembly save for the protruding wire contacts at its ends are then embedded in plastic in an injection molding process

general_automotives initial design which was never reduced to prototype or manufactured used a conventional cylindrical_resistor with axial_leads that was held in a plastic contact carrier with two contact strips of sheet_metal fastened to the plastic carrier
*1416 before the design was completed however general_automotives patent counsel advised it that a-b had relied on the use of sheet_metal to get the application for the482_patent allowed
in response general_automotive changed from sheet_metal contacts to round_wire contacts thereby eliminating any use of sheet_metal parts

after a trial held from 18-big_token__27_july_1995__big_token the jury found that the482_patent was not invalid either for anticipation or obviousness and that applying the district_courts` claim_meanings' general_automotive literally infringed claims 1 2 3 4 and 6 of the patent by manufacturing and selling its after-market vats key
the district_court instructed the jury that it need not reach infringement under the doctrine of equivalents if it found literal_infringement
the jury also found` clear evidence' that general_automotives infringement was willful
the district_court entered a final_judgment on 16_august_1995
general_automotive filed a post-verdict motion for a new_trial which in part challenged the sufficiency of the evidence
the district_court denied this motion and subsequently awarded strattec a portion of its attorney_fees based solely on the jurys finding of willfulness
this appeal followed

we first address whether general_automotives after-market vats_keys literally infringe either of independent_claims 1_or_6 of the482_patent
dependent claims 2-4 need not be considered in this appeal since as discussed below independent_claims 1_and_6 contain the significant limitations
see atlanta motoring accessories inc. v. saratoga tech. inc. 33_f.3d_1362 1364 31_uspq2d_1929 1930 fed.cir.1994
strattec did not assert infringement of dependent claim 5
we then consider infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
finally we review the jurys finding of willfulness and the district_courts award of attorney_fees which is based on that finding

literal infringement
analysis of patent infringement involves two steps 1 claim_construction to determine the scope of the claims followed by 2 determination of whether the properly construed claims encompass the accused structure
carroll touch inc. v. electro mechanical sys. inc. 15_f.3d_1573 1576 27_uspq2d_1836 1839 fed.cir.1993
the first is a question to be determined by the court
see markman v. westview instruments inc. 517_u.s._370 -- -- 116_s.ct._1384 1387 134_l.ed.2d_577 38_uspq2d_1461 1463 1996` we hold that the construction of a patent including terms of art within its claim is exclusively within the province of the court`
the second is a question of fact to be submitted to a jury
see hilton_davis chem co. v. warner-jenkinson co. 62_f.3d_1512 1520 35_uspq2d_1641 1647 fed.cir.1995 in banc reversed and remanded on other grounds 520_u.s._17 117_s.ct._1040 137_l.ed.2d_146 41_uspq2d_1865_(1997) citing winans v. denmead 56 u.s. 15 how

claim construction
claims 1_and_6 are the only independent_claims of the482_patent and they read as follows emphasis and reference numerals to the figures of the482_patent are added 1
a packaged electronic_component includes an insulating_body 11 an electronic_chip 13 disposed within the insulating_body and having a pair of terminals 13a 13b and two members of conductive_sheet_material 14 15 12 and 14 15 12 which connect to opposite_terminals 13a 13b the two members extending laterally from said terminals to the outside of the insulating_body and forming a pair of runner-like_leads 12 12 that terminate said laterally extending members
6
a packaged electronic_component that is made of only four elements the component including an insulating_body 11 ; an electronic_chip 13 disposed within the insulating_body and having a pair of terminals 13a 13b ; and
a pair of electrically conductive_sheet-like_members 14 15 12 and 14 15 12 each member having a first section that extends inwardly into the insulating_body and is electrically connected to a respective terminal of the electronic_chip and each member having a second section that extends outside the insulating_body and provides *1417 a runner-like lead 12 12 that facilitates the making and breaking of sliding electrical_contact with a respective one of a pair of stationary_contacts

the district_court rejected the claim_construction offered by the parties and construed the claims itself
the court provided the jury with its` claim_meanings' at the conclusion of the trial as part of its special instructions and interrogatories
general_automotive objected to these instructions and the district_court overruled those objections
as discussed in the next four subsections we can not agree with the district_courts claim_construction

1
`` sheet' and` sheet-like' the parties contend that the proper_construction of claim terms` members of conductive_sheet_material' claim 1 and` electrically conductive_sheet-like_members' claim 6 is critical to this appeal
we agree
the pertinent portion of the district_courts` claim_meanings' reads as follows emphasis added' sheet' or` sheet-like' mean conductive material that can be shaped to furnish electrical_contact between the resistor and the outside contact in the steering_column and can be shaped into contacts with a long_dimension along the axis of the key
the use of the sheet in the claims merely shows the advantages of that method and is not a part of the claim

the district_court erred when it instructed the jury that the use of the term` sheet' is` not a part of the claim'
the claimed` members of conductive_sheet_material' claim 1 and` electrically conductive_sheet-like_members' claim 6 are clearly limitations of the claims
although the claims themselves do not define the terms` sheet' and` sheet-like' the specification variously refers to` sheet_metal'` flat sheet_metal'` conductive_sheet_metal' and` electronically conductive_sheet_metal'
in addition the applicants added the references to` sheet' and` sheet-like' to the independent_claims in their response to the first examiners action
this is apparent from the following example which is the result of our comparison between originally filed claim 1 and issued claim 1 text that is present in the issued claim but absent from the original_claim is underlined and text that is absent from the issued claim but present in the original_claim is bracketed a packaged electronic_component includes an insulating_body [ completely enclosing ] an electronic_chip disposed within the insulating_body and having a pair of terminals and two members of conductive_sheet_material which connect to opposite_terminals the two members extending laterally from said terminals to the outside of the insulating_body and forming a pair of runner-like_leads that terminate said laterally extending members [ which are electrically connected to the terminals of the chip and which extend outwardly from said body said leads being particularly adapted for making and breaking sliding electrical_contact with stationary_contacts in an electronic circuit ]
as may be seen the added limitations more particularly define how the terminals of the electronic_chip are electrically connected to the runner-like_leads
in their amended claim the applicants made it clear that conductive_sheet_material connects to the terminals of the electronic_chip and forms the runner-like_leads
similar limitations were added in the other independent_claim that eventually issued as independent_claim 6

importantly the applicants also specifically relied on these new limitations in the remarks portion of their first amendment
they distinguished the teachings of u.s. patent no._3808,506 which describes wire leads electrically connecting circuit elements to button contact pads by arguing that in their claimed invention the electrical connection between the electronic_chip and the runner-like_leads is provided by members of conductive_sheet_material as opposed to wire leads extending laterally from the terminals of the electronic_chip to the outside of the insulating_body

a review of the482_patent and its prosecution_history reveals that the terms` sheet' and` sheet-like' do not have any special meanings in the art and that the482 inventors used these terms in their ordinary everyday sense i.e. to describe something flat with a fairly broad_surface relative to its thickness
the claims thus include within their literal scope only devices with conductive *1418 material that comprises a fairly broad_surface relative to its thickness

2
`` runner-like leads' the proper_construction of the claim term` runner-like_leads' is also important to this appeal
here the district_court provided the jury with the following` claim meaning' emphasis added' runner' or` runner-like' means having a long_dimension to furnish a greater likelihood of the keys contact touching the contact with the steering_column
this is what in part distinguished the patented_thing from the prior_art showing a point or small circular contact
the line along which the round_wire touches the steering_column contact is a` long_dimension'
the sheet has two long_dimensions width and breadth and its narrow dimension height becomes the width of the line that can complete the circuit like the line contact made by the wire
the sheet could be made thin enough that its contact area was no different from the round_wires

after reviewing the specification and prosecution_history we hold that the district_court erred in construing the` sheet' to be no different from a` round_wire' that was simply thinned
the dispositive distinction over the prior_art was the use of sheet_metal instead of round_wire
this distinction could not be eliminated by` construing' the terms` sheet' and` round_wire' as` not different'

3
`` electronic chip' the district_court provided the jury with the following construction of` electronic_chip' emphasis added' chip' is not used in whatever technical sense it may have ; here it means the same thing as an electrical component whether it is a complex integrated circuit of several subparts or a single resistor
a resistor itself is made of two leads case and resistant core at a minimum making it a packaged electronic_component

although we do not agree with the district_courts construction for it appears from the definition given to the jury that the district_court was confusing a` packaged electronic_component' i.e. the claimed invention as a whole with an` electronic_chip' i.e. an element of the claimed invention this aspect does not appear to have been material to the result and any error appears to have been harmless

4
`` only four elements' the district_court provided the jury with the following construction of` only four elements'' only four elements' is another illustration of the advantages of the patented_thing but unnecessarily dividing a single component into two does not necessarily keep a five-part thing from infringing

while a five-part_component might be equivalent to a four-part_component they never can be literally the same
it is not clear from the instruction whether the district_court was directing this explanation to the doctrine of equivalents
however at the trial the experts for both sides and counsel in argument drew this distinction and explained it to the jury

while prosecuting the application that led to the482_patent the applicants not only added` only four elements' to the preamble of what became claim 6 but also argued that the simplicity of this construction made it novel and nonobvious over the cited references none of which showed such an easily manufactured packaged component
consequently we find this prosecution_history important in determining the effect of the` only four elements' portion of claim 6
the applicants were clearly arguing that these words were significant to the claim
since to literally infringe claim 6 an accused device must have only four elements no reasonable_jury could have found infringement

b. literal infringement
literal infringement of a claim exists when every limitation recited in the claim is found in the accused device i.e. when the properly construed claim reads on the accused device exactly
johnston v. ivac corp. 885_f.2d_1574 1580 12_uspq2d_1382 1384 fed.cir.1989 citing cases
hilton_davis reiterated that where infringement is tried to a jury` an appellate court reviews the jury_verdict for lack of substantial evidence'
*1419 hilton_davis 62 f.3d at 1521 35 uspq2d at 1647 citing genentech inc. v. wellcome found ltd. 29_f.3d_1555 1565 31_uspq2d_1161 1168-69 fed.cir.1994
we owe no deference however to a jury_verdict reached upon an improper_claim_construction when as is the case here the correct construction of the claims is dispositive of the issue of infringement
see jurgens 927_f.2d_1552 18_uspq2d_1031 ; 2 hoechst 78 f.3d at 1578 38 uspq2d at 1128

under the proper_claim_construction no reasonable_jury could find literal_infringement since the independent_claims do not literally read upon general_automotives accused keys
not every element of independent_claims 1_and_6 can be found in the accused keys
general_automotives keys do not for example literally meet the` conductive_sheet_material' limitation in claim 1 or the related` conductive_sheet-like_members' limitation in claim 6 ; nor are they limited to the four elements required by claim 6

since the accused keys do not meet all of the claim limitations we hold that general_automotive does not infringe either independent_claim by manufacturing and selling its accused keys
remand on this issue is not necessary

c. infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
the jury did not reach the issue of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents and we can not make this factual finding in the first instance on appeal
see hilton_davis 62 f.3d at 1521 35 uspq2d at 1647` [ i ] nfringement under the doctrine of equivalents is an issue of fact
``

general_automotive asserts that strattec waived its right to a jury trial on the issue of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
we do not agree
the jury did not reach the issue because the jury was instructed not to decide equivalency if it found literal_infringement
this does not constitute waiver

however the prosecution_history requires that the use of round_wires shown in the prior_art is not equivalent to the use of sheet-like_leads
we therefore conclude that no reasonable_jury could find otherwise based upon correctly construed claims with due consideration of the prior_art and the estoppel that results from the prosecution_history in this case

willfulness and attorney fees
on appeal we have also been asked to decide whether the jury properly found by clear and convincing evidence that general_automotives infringement was willful and whether the district_court properly exercised its discretion pursuant to 35 u.s.c.¡± 285 to award strattec a portion of its attorney_fees

the jury finding of willfulness can not stand
even the district_court expressed reservations about the jurys willfulness finding
since we hold that the properly construed claims of the482_patent can not literally be read upon general_automotives accused keys the jury clearly could not have correctly found willful infringement

the district_courts award of attorney_fees must be vacated
section 285 reads in pertinent part` the court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney_fees to the prevailing party'
35 u.s.c.¡± 285 1994
the courts exceptional-case analysis consists of one sentence` strattec takes $ 96,209.00 in attorneys fees from general_automotive based only on the jurys finding of willfulness'
no precedent of this court upholds a finding that a case is exceptional within the meaning of ¡± 285 where the district_court *1420 based the award only on willfulness and where we do not uphold the willfulness finding on appeal

conclusion
for the above reasons we hold that the jurys finding of literal_infringement was based upon an erroneous claim_construction
applying the proper_claim_construction no reasonable_jury could find infringement of the482_patent by general_automotive either literally or equivalently
therefore we reverse the final_judgment of infringement entered 16_august_1995
since we hold as a matter of law that there is no infringement the jurys finding of willfulness also falls
we thus vacate the post-judgment order entered 19_september_1995 awarding strattec part of its attorney_fees based solely upon the jurys finding of willfulness
