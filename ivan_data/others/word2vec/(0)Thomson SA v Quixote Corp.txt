rich circuit_judge
thomson s.a.` thomson' appeals from the june_24,_1997 order of the united_states_district_court for the district of delaware in an action for patent_infringement
see thomson s.a. v. quixote_corp. 979_f.supp._286 d.del.1997` thomson i'
the court denied thomsons motion for judgment as a matter of law or in the alternative for a new_trial and sustained the jury_verdict that u.s. patent nos._4868,808 5,182,743 4,961,183 and 5,175,725 are invalid for lack of novelty under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 g
we affirm

background
plaintiff-appellant thomson is the assignee of the patents in suit which are directed to optical information-storage devices such as compact discs` cds'
thomson makes and markets machines that` read' or` play' cds and grants licenses under the patents in suit to companies which produce cds
defendants-appellees quixote_corp. and disc_manufacturing inc. collectively` quixote' make cds.1

thomson sued quixote for patent_infringement
the parties agreed to base the outcome of the trial on three representative_claims claims 1_and_13 of u.s. patent no._4868,808 and claim 1 of u.s. patent no._5182,743
before the full trial the district *1174 court conducted a markman_hearing and issued a written opinion construing the representative_claims

at trial the parties stipulated that thomsons invention date for the patents in suit is august 25 1972
quixotes defense included evidence purporting to show that the representative_claims are anticipated by an unpatented_laser_videodisc developed before august 1972 by a non-party mca discovision inc.` mca'
after trial the jury found in special verdicts that all of the representative_claims were literally infringed but that those claims are invalid due to lack of novelty i.e. anticipated under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 g

thomson submitted a motion requesting that the district_court either set aside the jurys verdict of invalidity and enter judgment as a matter of law` jmol' holding the patents not invalid or grant a new_trial on the lack of novelty issue
thomson argued that jmol was proper because there was insufficient evidence in the record to support the jurys anticipation verdict concerning certain claim limitations the court had held to be present following the markman_hearing

in its opinion denying thomsons motion the district_court described evidence in the record supporting the jurys finding of anticipation for each of the limitations that thomson asserted had not been proven to be present in the mca videodisc
see thomson i 979 f.supp.at 292-98
the court noted that the evidence supporting the anticipation finding came from one or more sources the live testimony of two people who had worked on the mca laser videodisc project ; an experts report and portions of his deposition_testimony both of which were read into the record ; the experts exhibits ; and certain mca documents that the expert had reviewed
id.at 288 292-98
the court concluded that substantial_evidence supports the jurys finding that quixote had shown by clear and convincing_evidence that every limitation in the representative_claims was anticipated by the mca device
id.at 295 298

thomson appeals the district_courts denial of its motion for jmol

analysis
jmol is appropriate when` a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue'
johns hopkins univ
v. cellpro inc. 152_f.3d_1342 1353 47_u.s.p.q.2d_1705 1713 fed.cir.1998 quoting fed.r.civ.p
50 a 1
we review a denial of a motion for jmol de novo by reapplying the jmol standard
see markman v. westview instruments inc. 52_f.3d_967 975 34_u.s.p.q.2d_1321 1326 fed.cir.1995 in banc
under this standard we can reverse a denial of a motion for jmol only if the jurys factual findings are not supported by substantial_evidence or if the legal conclusions implied from the jurys verdict can not in law be supported by those findings
see cybor corp. v. fas technologies inc. 138_f.3d_1448 1454 46_u.s.p.q.2d_1169 1172 fed.cir.1998 in banc

thomsons first argument on appeal is that in its memorandum opinion denying thomsons jmol motion the district_court essentially ignored specific claim limitations that the court had identified following the markman_hearing.2 this argument is particularly unpersuasive given the format of the district_courts opinion in which the court began its analysis of each disputed limitation by reviewing the construction of the limitation it had made in the markman_hearing

thomsons core argument in support of reversing the district_courts denial of its motion for jmol is based on its assertions that 1 the jury_verdict rests upon mere testimonial evidence by the two non-party mca employees who worked on the videodisc project and 2 this evidence is insufficient as a matter of law to support a holding of invalidity under subsection 102 g because such testimonial evidence by inventors of their prior_invention requires corroboration
even if we accept thomsons first assertion and further assume that the mca employees *1175 were acting as inventors in the laser videodisc project thomsons argument fails because this case does not present circumstances in which there is a need for corroboration as hereinafter explained

we begin with the language of 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 g a person shall be entitled to a patent unless-.. g before the applicants invention thereof the invention was made in this country by another who had not abandoned suppressed or concealed it
in determining priority of invention there shall be considered not only the respective dates of conception and reduction to practice of the invention but also the reasonable diligence of one who was first to conceive and last to practice from a time prior to conception by the other

we have interpreted the first_sentence of subsection 102 g to permit qualifying art to invalidate a patent_claim even if the same art may not qualify as prior_art under other subsections of ¡± 102
see e.g. checkpoint sys. inc. v. united states int l trade comm n 54_f.3d_756 761 35_u.s.p.q.2d_1042 1046 fed.cir.1995 ; amgen inc. v. chugai pharm co. 927_f.2d_1200 1205 18_u.s.p.q.2d_1016 1020 fed.cir.19913 art is not qualified under subsection 102 g unless viewed under a rule of reason the totality of the evidence that the art satisfies the requirements of subsection 102 g is clear and convincing
see price v. symsek 988_f.2d_1187 1194-95 26_u.s.p.q.2d_1031 1036-37 fed.cir.1993
we have also often held in both interference and infringement lawsuits that an inventors testimony alone respecting the facts surrounding a claim of derivation or priority of invention can not satisfy the clear and convincing_standard without corroboration
see e.g. cooper v. goldfarb 154_f.3d_1321 1330 47_u.s.p.q.2d_1896 1903 fed.cir.1998 interference ; woodland_trust v. flowertree nursery inc. 148_f.3d_1368 1371 47_u.s.p.q.2d_1363 1366 fed.cir.1998 infringement4 although courts have reviewed infringement suits in which the defendant had attempted to prove subsection 102 g -type anticipation by a non-party inventor at trial see e.g. eibel process co. v. minnesota & ontario paper co. 261_u.s._45 43_s.ct._322 67_l.ed._523_(1923) ; washburn & moen v. beat'em all barbed-wire 143_u.s._275 12_s.ct._443 36_l.ed._154_(1892) ; *1176 new idea farm equip corp. v. sperry corp. 916_f.2d_1561 16_u.s.p.q.2d_1424_(fed.cir.1990) neither the supreme court nor we have directly held whether the corroboration_rule must be applied to testimony by non-party inventors that is directed to establishing their invention as anticipating the claims at issue.5

the cases that discuss skepticism of uncorroborated inventor testimony directed to establishing priority over an opponents patent_claim involve situations where the inventor is self-interested in the outcome of the trial and is thereby tempted to` remember' facts favorable to his or her case
see e.g. barbed-wire 143 u.s. at 284-85 12_s.ct._443 indicating that testifying non-party inventors patents would increase in value if patent_claims at issue were invalidated ; price v. symsek 988 f.2d at 1194 26 u.s.p.q.2d at 1036 showing that testifying inventors interfering patent_claims would be invalidated if he could not establish priority ; and holding that board extended corroboration_rule beyond reasonable bounds

the clear and convincing_standard of proof required to establish priority along with the numerous methods in the federal rules of civil procedure and evidence by which a party may test challenge impeach and rebut oral testimony normally protects patentees from erroneous findings of invalidity
see price v. symsek 988 f.2d at 1192-94 26 u.s.p.q.2d at 1035-36 discussing standards of proof and requiring interference junior party to establish priority by clear and convincing_evidence
thus the corroboration_rule is needed only to counterbalance the self-interest of a testifying inventor against the patentee
we therefore hold that corroboration is required only when the testifying inventor is asserting a claim of derivation or priority of his or her invention and is a named party an employee of or assignor to a named party or otherwise is in a position where he or she stands to directly and substantially gain by his or her invention being found to have priority over the patent_claims at issue

in the current case the purported inventors who testified were non-parties and their testimony concerned an unpatented prior_invention
although thomson argues that the corroboration_rule is justified here because both testifying witnesses were involved in businesses that supplied goods and services to quixote this does not rise to the level of self-interest required to justify triggering application of the corroboration_rule
in fact thomsons only reference to the record showing this potential source of bias is a transcript of thomsons cross examination of one of the witnesses which means that the jury had the necessary facts to assess the credibility of the witnesses

we therefore conclude that the district_court was correct in holding that substantial_evidence supports the jurys finding that quixote showed by clear and convincing_evidence that every limitation in the representative_claims was anticipated and that the district_court was correct in denying thomsons motion for jmol

finally because we hold that the testimony of the presumed mca inventors did not have to be corroborated we do not reach thomsons argument that quixotes experts claim charts and expert report are entitled to no weight

conclusion
in view of the foregoing we affirm the district_courts decision to sustain the jury_verdict and deny thomsons motion for jmol

affirmed

the interpretation of subsection 102 g to provide a prior_art basis for invalidating a patent_claim in infringement litigation was not intended by the drafters of the 1952 patent act
as the second sentence in the subsection indicates 102 g was written merely to provide a statutory basis for determining priority of invention in the context of interference proceedings before what was then the united states patent office
see p.j

nevertheless the first_sentence is clear and as the cases show has been taken to have independent significance as a basis for prior_art outside of the interference context
this result makes sense
the first to invent who has invested time and labor in making and using the invention-but who might have opted not to apply for a patent-will not be liable for infringing anothers patent on that same invention while the public will have benefited because the invention was not abandoned suppressed or concealed
however in view of these and other related policy concerns and amendment of the statute we have made clear that art qualifying only under subsection 102 g may not be used under ¡± 103 to invalidate other patents of fellow employees engaged in team research
see oddzon prods. inc. v. just toys inc. 122_f.3d_1396 1402-03 43_u.s.p.q.2d_1641 1644-45 fed.cir.1997 discussing application of bass 59_c.c.p.a._1342 474_f.2d_1276 1290 177_u.s.p.q._178 189 1973 and the 1984 amendments to ¡± 103

thomson incorrectly argues that we extended the corroboration_rule to include non-inventors in woodland_trust
in woodland_trust the infringement defendant argued that the patent_claims at issue were invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 a testifying that the claims had been anticipated by his prior_invention and public use
thus the corroboration_rule was properly applied to the testimony of the defendant because he was a party who claimed to be an inventor
see woodland_trust 148 f.3d at 1369-70 47 u.s.p.q.2d at 1365 holding that evidence did not meet clear and convincing_standard required to show anticipation despite corroborating testimony of four witnesses where the witnesses were related to defendant by blood or long friendship and no corroborating physical evidence was submitted despite defendants assertion that he had used the invention for more than ten years

this includes in re reuter 670_f.2d_1015 210_u.s.p.q._249_(ccpa_1981)
in reuter the ccpa affirmed the patent and trademark offices reissue proceeding finding that claims were unpatentable under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103
the reuter court held that an experts affidavit in addition to deposition_testimony of one of the patents named inventors showed a motivation to combine the cited prior_art references
thus the courts statement that no weight should be given to an uncorroborated portion of the experts affidavit in which the expert asserted that he had invented an anticipating device see reuter 670 f.2d at 1022 210 u.s.p.q.at 256 was dictum and therefore not controlling precedent
