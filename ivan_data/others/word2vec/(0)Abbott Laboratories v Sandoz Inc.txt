opinion
rader circuit_judge
in this case the same_patent u.s. patent no._4935,507 the ¡¬507_patent occasions litigation in both the united_states_district_court for the eastern_district of virginia and the united_states_district_court for the northern_district of illinois
the virginia district court granted the motion of lupin_ltd. and lupin_pharmaceuticals inc. collectively lupin for summary_judgment of noninfringement
in the other case the illinois district court denied a preliminary_injunction to abbott_laboratories the exclusive_licensee of the ¡¬507_patent based on the claim_construction from the eastern_district of virginia

because the eastern_district of virginia correctly construed the claims of the ¡¬507_patent and correctly discerned no genuine issues of material fact on literal_infringement of claims 2-5 or infringement by equivalents of claims 1-5 this court affirms its partial summary_judgment of noninfringement
likewise this court affirms the northern_district of illinois denial of abbotts motion for a preliminary_injunction based in large part on the same correct claim_construction

i. abbott_laboratories the exclusive_licensee of the ¡¬507_patent markets crystalline_cefdinir according to the ¡¬507_patent under the trade name omnicef
the virginia case arose when lupin sought a declaratory_judgment of noninfringement against abbott_laboratories and astellas_pharma inc. the owner of the ¡¬507_patent collectively abbott
the food and drug_administration had previously approved lupins abbreviated new drug application anda to market a generic version of omnicef
lupins generic product contains almost exclusively the crystal_b form of crystalline_cefdinir cefdinir_monohydrate whereas abbotts omnicef_product contains the crystal_a form of crystalline_cefdinir cefdinir_anhydrate
further lupin makes its products with processes other than those claimed in the ¡¬507_patent
for these reasons lupin brought the virginia action to clarify that its proposed product would not infringe a valid patent
abbott counterclaimed for infringement
the eastern_district of virginia construed the claims lupin_ltd. v. abbott_laboratories 484_f.supp.2d_448 e.d.va.2007 lupin_cc_order and ultimately granted-in-part lupins motion for summary_judgment of noninfringement as to both literal and equivalent_infringement for claims 2-5 and as to equivalent_infringement for claim 1 lupin_ltd. v. abbott labs. 491_f.supp.2d_563 e.d.va.2007 lupin_sj_order
the parties stipulated to the dismissal without prejudice of the remaining claims invalidity and counterclaims literal_infringement of claim 1

in the illinois action abbott sued sandoz inc. and sandoz gmbh collectively sandoz teva_pharmaceuticals_usa inc. *1286 and teva pharmaceuticals industries ltd. collectively teva ranbaxy_laboratories ltd. ranbaxy inc. par_pharmaceutical_companies inc. and par_pharmaceutical all defendants collectively sandoz and teva for infringement of the ¡¬507_patent
like lupin sandoz and teva had previously filed andas seeking to market generic versions of omnicef
abbott sought a preliminary_injunction in the illinois case
for purposes of that motion the parties agreed to adopt the eastern_district of virginias claim_construction from the lupin_case
abbott_labs_.
v. sandoz inc. 486_f.supp.2d_767 n.d.ill.2007 sandoz_pi_order
despite this agreement the parties to the sandoz_case disagreed as to how to interpret some of the eastern_district of virginias constructions necessitating some clarification by the northern_district of illinois
486 f.supp.2d at 770-71 disputing` crystal_a'` peaks' and` about' and seeking construction of` powder x-ray diffraction pattern' which the eastern_district of virginia had not defined
ultimately the northern_district of illinois based on the claim_construction from virginia denied the preliminary_injunction

both cases arrived at this court on appeal
this court heard the cases together and decides them together with this decision

ii
the ¡¬507_patent has five claims all of which abbott asserts against lupin as well as sandoz and teva
claim 1 claims crystalline_cefdinir using its chemical name and defining its unique characteristics with powder x-ray diffraction pxrd angle peaks 1
crystalline 7- [ 2- 2-a minothiazol-4-yl -2-hydroxyiminoacetamido ] -3-vinyl-3-cephem.-4-carboxylic acid syn isomer which shows the peaks at the diffraction_angles shown in the following table in its powder x-ray diffraction pattern

diffraction_angle ¢X

about 14.7¢X

about 17.8¢X

about 21.5¢X

about 22.0¢X

about 23.4¢X

about 24.5¢X

about 28.1¢X

¡¬507_patent col.16 ll.13-27
in contrast claims 2-5 claim crystalline_cefdinir without any pxrd_peak_limitations but with descriptions of processes used to obtain the crystalline_cefdinir
claims 2_and_5 are independent 2
crystalline 7- [ 2- 2-a minothiazol-4-yl -2-hydroxyiminoacetamido ] -3-vinyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid syn isomer which is obtainable by acidifying a solution containing 7- [ 2- 2-aminothiazol-4-yl -2-hydroxyiminoacetamido ] -3-vinyl -3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid syn isomer at room temperature or under warming
5
crystalline 7- [ 2- 2-aminothiazol-4-yl -2-hydroxyiminoacetamido ] -3-vinyl -3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid syn isomer which is obtainable by dissolving 7- [ 2- 2-aminothiazol-4-yl -2 -hydroxyiminoacetamido ] -3-vinyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid syn isomer in an alcohol continuing to stir the solution slowly under warming then cooling the solution to room temperature and allowing the solution to stand
id.at col. 16 ll.29-34 43-50

these claims use pxrd as a way to claim the structure and characteristics of the unique crystalline_form
pxrd is a method for identifying and distinguishing different crystalline compounds
the method beams x-rays toward a powdered chemical
the method then measures the ways the rays reflect or bend upon contact with the chemical
the diffraction_angles *1287 and intensities vary with the type and purity of the test compound
a graph then plots the diffraction_angle on one axis and the intensity on another
these graphs yield a unique` fingerprint' for each crystalline_form of a chemical
a more sensitive form of x-ray diffraction is single crystal x-ray diffraction scxrd
as this name suggests this method uses only a single crystal as a sample
scxrd does not detect intensity but produces a more precise diffraction_angle measurement

the ¡¬507_patent was not the first cefdinir patent
rather astellas prior_art u.s. patent no._4559,334 the ¡¬334_patent describes the discovery of cefdinir as a compound demonstrating high antimicrobial activity
¡¬334_patent col. 11 ll.18-24
the ¡¬334_patent expired on may_6,_2007

the ¡¬507_patent_claims priority to japanese patent application no._62-206199 the jp_¡¬199_application which claimed two crystalline_forms of cefdinir` crystal_a' and` crystal_b'
the jp_¡¬199_application claimed crystals_a and b very specifically defining crystal_a by three infrared ir -absorption wavelengths and sixteen pxrd_angles and intensities
in contrast crystal_b featured five ir-absorption wavelengths and twenty-one pxrd_angles/intensities

despite using the jp_¡¬199_application for priority the ¡¬507_patents specification differs significantly
specifically abbott actually fujisawa pharmaceutical co. ltd. astellas predecessor in interest jettisoned the crystal_b_disclosure found in the jp_¡¬199_application and crafted broader_claims in its prosecution of the ¡¬507_patent
because the jp_¡¬199_applications defines crystal_a and crystal_b physiochemically rather than structurally the forms actually represent subgenuses of crystalline_cefdinir
thus crystals_a and b comprise crystalline_forms of varying structures which in the context of this case means varying levels of hydration

the eastern_district of virginia construed the claim_terms` crystalline'` shows'` peaks' and` about' as follows 1` crystalline' means` crystal_a as outlined in the specification' ; 2` shows' requires the display of a powder x-ray diffraction pattern which demonstrates the existence of the relevant peaks to a scientifically acceptable degree of certainty either visually or by other appropriate means of data display ; 3` peaks' is the plural of` peak ;' a` peak exists at a powder x-ray diffraction_angle that corresponds to an intensity measurement greater than measurements attributable to` noise' if that angle is immediately preceded by and followed by powder x-ray diffraction_angle with a lower intensity measurement ;` noise' refers to those portions of a pxrd pattern produced by intrinsic measurement error and which can not be associated with a scientifically significant quantity of the material which is the subject of the pxrd test ; 4` about' encompasses measurement errors inherently associated with powder x-ray diffraction testing

the eastern_district of virginia also concluded that claims 2-5 were product-by-process_claims
id
later the district_court concluded that the process_terms of claims 2-5 indicated by the phrase` obtainable by' limit the claims to the specified processes and process_steps
in reaching that conclusion the trial_court followed this courts opinion in atlantic_thermoplastics_co. v. faytex_corp. 970_f.2d_834_(fed.cir.1992)

evaluation of a summary_judgment of noninfringement requires two steps claim_construction which this court reviews without deference cybor corp. v. fas technologies inc. 138_f.3d_1448 1451 fed.cir.1998 en banc and comparison of the properly construed claims to the accused product process or composition of matter which in the context of summary_judgment also occurs without deference see ormco corp. v. align technology inc. 498_f.3d_1307 1312 fed.cir.2007
although infringement by equivalency is a question of fact this court may affirm summary_judgment` where no reasonable fact finder could find equivalence'

a
claim construction
because the claims define the patent right see innova/pure water inc. v. safari water filtration systems inc. 381_f.3d_1111 1115 fed.cir.2004 naturally` the claims themselves provide substantial guidance as to the meaning of particular claim_terms'
phillips v. awh_corp. 415_f.3d_1303 1314 fed.cir.2005 en banc
but the claims` must be read in view of the specification of which they are a part'
markman v. westview instruments inc. 52_f.3d_967 979 fed.cir.1995 en banc affd 517_u.s._370 116_s.ct._1384 134_l.ed.2d_577_(1996)
a patents specification provides necessary context for understanding the claims and` is always highly relevant to the claim_construction_analysis'
phillips 415 f.3d at 1315 quoting vitronics corp. v. conceptronic inc. 90_f.3d_1576 1582 fed.cir.1996
while equally true in a general sense sometimes the specification offers practically incontrovertible directions about claim meaning
for example inventors may act as their own lexicographers and give a specialized definition of claim_terms
see id.at 1316
likewise inventors and applicants may intentionally disclaim or disavow subject_matter that would otherwise fall within the scope of the claim
see id

when consulting the specification to clarify the meaning of claim_terms courts must take care not to import limitations into the claims from the specification
this court has recognized the` fine line between' the encouraged and the prohibited use of the specification
comark commc'ns inc. v. harris corp. 156_f.3d_1182 1186 fed.cir.1998
when the specification describes a single_embodiment to enable the invention this court will not limit broader claim_language to that single application` unless the patentee has demonstrated a clear_intention to limit the claim_scope usingwords or expressions of manifest exclusion or restriction
`` liebel-flarsheim co. v. medrad inc. 358_f.3d_898 906 fed.cir.2004 quoting teleflex inc. v. ficosa n. am corp. 299_f.3d_1313 1327 fed.cir.2002
by the same token the claims can not` enlarge what is patented beyond what the inventor has described as the invention'
biogen inc. v. berlex labs. inc. 318_f.3d_1132 1140 fed.cir.2003 quoting netword llc v. centraal corp. 242_f.3d_1347 1352 fed.cir.2001
thus this court may reach a narrower construction limited to the embodiment s disclosed in the specification when the claims themselves the specification or the prosecution_history clearly indicate that the invention encompasses no more than that confined structure or method
see_liebel-flarsheim 358 f.3d at 908

along with the specification the prosecution_history is` intrinsic_evidence' *1289 of the meaning of the claims because it` provides evidence of how the [ united_states patent & trademark office pto ] and the inventor understood the patent'
phillips 415 f.3d at 1317
although often producing ambiguities occasioned by ongoing negotiations between the inventor and the pto` the prosecution_history can often inform the meaning of the claim_language by demonstrating how the inventor understood the invention and whether the inventor limited the invention in the course of prosecution making the claim_scope narrower than it would otherwise be'
id
`` [ c ] lear and unmistakable' statements during prosecution may also disavow claim_scope
computer docking station corp. v. dell inc. 519_f.3d_1366 1374 fed.cir.2008 quoting purdue pharma l.p. v. endo pharms. inc. 438_f.3d_1123 1136 fed.cir.2006
again owing in part to the inherent ambiguities of prosecution_history the doctrine of prosecution disclaimer only applies to unambiguous disavowals
see id.at 1375

`` crystalline' the eastern_district of virginias construction of` crystalline' in claims 1-5 as` crystal_a' included the important caveat` as outlined in the specification'
lupin_cc_order 484 f.supp.2d at 459
although the eastern_district noted the parties agreed that` crystalline' ordinarily means exhibiting` uniformly arranged molecules or atoms' id.at 454 the court relied on the language of the claims themselves the specification and the prosecution_history to arrive at the more specific meaning recited in the specification

the ¡¬507_specification states that` crystal_a of the compound i [ cefdinir ] shows its distinguishing peaks' at the seven particular pxrd_angles enumerated in claim 1
¡¬507_patent col.1 ll.51-62
indeed the phrase` crystal_a of the compound i' appears throughout the written description and the patent offers the following definition` any crystal of the compound i which shows substantially the same diffraction pattern [ as in the table in col.1/claim 1 ] is identified as crystal_a of the compound i'
id.at col.1 l.67-col.2 l.2
as the eastern_district correctly concluded had astellas intended in the chart found in column 1 to distinguish crystal_a from other forms of crystalline_cefdinir that also fall within the scope of claim 1 it would have listed at a minimum an eighth peak associated only with crystal_a
however by listing in column 1 only the same sevendistinguishing peaks featured in claim 1 astellas confirmed that crystal_a was synonymous with the invention listed in claim 1
lupin_cc_order 484 f.supp.2d at 456-57
the problem within the confines of claim 1 is that defining` crystalline' as` crystal_a' where` crystal_a' incorporates the seven pxrd_peak_limitations arguably renders the remainder of that claim redundant
to distinguish the invention however the specification refers several times to` crystal_a of the compound i of the present_invention' see e.g. ¡¬507_patent col.2 ll.15-17 and offers no suggestion that the recited processes could produce non-crystal_a compounds even though other types of cefdinir_crystals namely crystal_b were known in the art
as noted earlier the crystal_b_formulation actually appears in the parent_jp_¡¬199_application
thus abbott knew exactly how to describe and claim crystal_b_compounds
knowing of crystal_b however abbott chose to claim only the a form in the ¡¬507_patent
thus the trial_court properly limited the term` crystalline' to` crystal_a'
the trial_courts definition correctly identifies claim 1s literal_scope

*1290 unlike claim 1 claims 2-5 do not recite the seven pxrd_peaks expressly associated with crystal_a in the ¡¬507_specification
nonetheless the eastern_district of virginia limited` crystalline' to` crystal_a' in these claims as well the trial_court gave two reasons for this limitation
first` [ t ] he process_steps detailed in those claims [ claims 2-5 ] correspond with the processes for making crystal_a disclosed in the specification under the headingthe process for preparing crystal_a of the compound i
`` id.at 457 quoting ¡¬507_patent col.2 ll.13-14
second the parent_jp_¡¬199_application recited these steps` to distinguish between preparations of crystal_a and crystal_b'
id
( citing jp_¡¬199_application col.6 ll.1-25

in limiting` crystalline' to` crystal_a' in claims 1-5 the eastern_district of virginia did not improperly import the preferred embodiment into the claims
initially crystal_a is the only embodiment described in the specification
as discussed above the specifications recitation of crystal_a as its sole embodiment does not alone justify the trial_courts limitation of claim_scope to that single disclosed embodiment
see_liebel-flarsheim 358 f.3d at 906` [ t ] his court has expressly rejected the contention that if a patent describes only a single_embodiment the claims of the patent must be construed as being limited to that embodiment`
in this case however the rest of the intrinsic_evidence including the prosecution_history and the priority_jp_¡¬199_application evince a clear_intention to limit the ¡¬507_patent to crystal_a as defined by the seven pxrd_peaks in the specification and in claim 1

initially the eastern_district of virginia properly considered the jp_¡¬199_application as relevant objective evidence of the inventors knowledge at the filing of the ¡¬507_patent
while statements made during prosecution of a foreign counterpart to a u.s. patent_application have a narrow application to u.s. claim_construction pfizer inc. v. ranbaxy labs ltd. 457_f.3d_1284 1290 fed.cir.2006 in this case the jp_¡¬199_application is part of the prosecution_history of the ¡¬507_patent itself
indeed the ¡¬507_patent_claims priority from the jp_¡¬199_application
furthermore the trial_court did not rely on attorney argument or amendments during a foreign prosecution as in pfizer but consulted only the contents of the foreign priority application
the jp_¡¬199_application strongly suggests that the ¡¬507_patent intentionally excluded crystal_b_compounds
as discussed above the jp_¡¬199_application establishes unequivocally that abbott knew and could describe both crystal_a and crystal_b. abbott could have retained the disclosure of crystal_b to support the broader_claims of the ¡¬507_patent but instead disclosed and claimed a alone

furthermore the prosecution_history of the ¡¬507_patent shows a clear and intentional disavowal of claim_scope beyond crystal_a. co-inventor takao takaya who prepared samples according to examples 14_and_16 of the prior_art ¡¬ 334 patent and a sample of` crystal_a of the present application' offered a declaration that crystal_a was more stable than the prior_art samples from the ¡¬334_patent
an analytical chemist yoshihiko okamato corroborated this evidence
j.a
501-04
beyond these declarations the applicant specifically limited the invention to crystal_a` the method of preparation of the crystalline_form of the presently claimed compounds is not considered the heart of the present_invention
the crystalline_form of the compound represents the inventive concept hereof and it is clear that [ the ¡¬ 334 patent ] does not anticipate or suggest said crystalline_form'
j.a
511 response to office action of may_11,_1989 received october 27 1989 at 6

*1291 given the exclusive focus on crystal_a in the specification as well as the prosecution_history of the ¡¬507_patent the eastern_district of virginia properly limited` crystalline' in claims 1-5 to` crystal_a'

2. proper_interpretation of product-by process_claims1
this court addresses part iii.a.2 of this opinion en banc which addresses the proper_interpretation of product-by-process_claims in determining infringement

claims 2-5 of the ¡¬507_patent begin by reciting a product crystalline_cefdinir and then recite a series of steps by which this product is` obtainable'
the eastern_district of virginia correctly categorized claims 2-5 as product-by-process_claims
on appeal abbott argues that the eastern_district erred in construing the process_steps of claims 2-5 under the rule in atlantic_thermoplastics 970 f.2d at 846-47 that` process_terms in product-by-process_claims serve as limitations in determining infringement' rather than in accordance with scripps_clinic & research_foundation v. genentech inc. 927_f.2d_1565 1583 fed.cir.1991` [ t ] he correct reading of product-by-process_claims is that they are not limited to product prepared by the process set forth in the claims`
this court takes this opportunity to clarify en banc the scope of product-by-process_claims by adopting the rule in atlantic_thermoplastics

in atlantic_thermoplastics this court considered the scope of product-by-process_claim 26 in the patent at issue` [ t ] he molded_innersole produced by the method of claim 1'
970 f.2d at 836
the patentee urged that competing indistinguishable innersoles made by a different_method nonetheless infringed claim 26
id.at 838
this court rejected the patentees position
this court in atlantic_thermoplastics construed product-by-process_claims as limited by the process
id.at 846-47

this rule finds extensive support in supreme_court opinions that have addressed the proper reading of product-by-process_claims
see smith v. goodyear_dental_vulcanite_co. 93_u.s._486 493 23_l.ed._952_(1877)` the process detailed is thereby made as much a part of the invention as are the materials of which the product is composed
`` ; goodyear_dental_vulcanite_co. v. davis 102_u.s._222 224 26_l.ed._149_(1880)` [ t ] o constitute infringement of the patent both the material of which the dental_plate is made.. and the process of constructing the plate.. must be employed
`` ; merrill v. yeomans 94_u.s._568 24_l.ed._235_(1877) ; cochrane v. badische_anilin & soda_fabrik 111_u.s._293 4_s.ct._455 28_l.ed._433_(1884) basf ; the wood-paper_patent 23_wall._566 90_u.s._566 596 23_l.ed._31_(1874) ; plummer v. sargent 120_u.s._442 7_s.ct._640 30_l.ed._737_(1887) ; gen._elec co. v. wabash_appliance_corp. 304_u.s._364 58_s.ct._899 82_l.ed._1402_(1938) ; see also atl
thermoplastics 970 f.2d at 839-42 discussing each of these cases
in these cases the supreme_court consistently noted that process_terms that define the product in a product-by-process_claim serve as enforceable limitations
in addition the binding case_law of this courts predecessor_courts the united_states_court of customs and patent_appeals see in re hughes 496_f.2d_1216 1219 ccpa 1974 acknowledging that` true_product_claims' are` broader' in scope than product-by-process_claims *1292 and the united_states_court of claims see tri-wall_containers v. united_states 187_ct.cl._326 408_f.2d_748 751 1969 followed the same rule

this courts sister_circuits also followed the general_rule that the defining process_terms limit product-by-process_claims
see e.g. hide-ite leather v. fiber prods. 226_f._34 36 1st cir.1915` it is also a well-recognized rule that although a product has definite characteristics by which it may be identified apart from the process still if in a claim for the product it is not so described but is set forth in the terms of the process nothing can be held to infringe the claim which is not made by the process
`` ; paeco inc. v. applied_moldings inc. 562_f.2d_870 876 3d cir.1977` a patent granted on a product_claim describing one process grants no monopoly as to identical_products manufactured by a different_process`
indeed this court itself had articulated that rule` for this reason even though product-by-process_claims are limited by and defined by the process determination of patentability is based on the product itself'
in re thorpe 777_f.2d_695 697 fed.cir.1985 emphasis added

the supreme_court has long emphasized the limiting requirement of process_steps in product-by-process_claims
in basf the court considered a patent relating to artificial_alizarine
specifically the patent_claimed` [ a ] rtificial alizarine produced from anthracine or its derivatives by either of the methods_herein described or by any other_method which will produce a like_result'
111 u.s. at 296 4_s.ct._455 quoting u.s. patent reissue no
re 4,321
in turn the specification generally described a method for making artificial_alizarine involving anthracine or its derivatives
alizarine had been in use for thousands of years as a red textile dye traditionally extracted from madder_root
pure alizarine has the chemical formula c14h8 o4 but` artificial_alizarines' available in the market at the time of the litigation varied from almost completely pure alizarine to combinations of alizarine and anthrapurpurine to pure purpurine containing no alizarine whatsoever
id.at 309-10 4_s.ct._455
the defendants product contained approximately sixty percent anthrapurpurine
thus both alizarine and artificial_alizarines were known in the prior_art
the supreme_court clearly articulated some of the scope and validity problems that arise when process_limitations of product-by-process_claims are ignored [ the defendants product ] is claimed by the plaintiff to be the artificial_alizarine described in no._4321 and to be physically chemically and in coloring properties similar to that
but what that is is not defined in no._4321 except that it is the product of the process described in no._4321
therefore unless it is shown that the process of no._4321 was followed to produce the defendants article or unless it is shown that that article could not be produced by any other_process the defendants article can not be identified as the product of the process of no._4321
nothing of the kind is shown

* * * if the words of the claim are to be construed to cover all artificial_alizarine whatever its ingredients produced from anthracine or its derivatives by methods invented since graebe and liebermann invented the bromine process we then have a patent for a product or composition of matter which gives no information as to how it is to be identified
every patent for a product or composition of matter must identify it so that it can be recognized aside from the description of the process for making it or else nothing can be held to infringe the *1293 patent which is not made by that process
id.at 310 4_s.ct._455 emphasis added

after basf the supreme_court continued to emphasize the importance of process_steps in evaluating the infringement of product-by-process_claims
see e.g. plummer 120 u.s. at 448 7_s.ct._640` [ w ] hatever likeness that may appear between the product of the process described in the patent and the article made by the defendants their identity is not established unless it is shown that they are made by the same_process
`` ; gen._elec co. 304 u.s. at 373 58_s.ct._899` [ a ] patentee who does not distinguish his product from what is old except by reference express or constructive to the process by which he produced it can not secure a monopoly on the product by whatever means produced'
( footnote omitted

thus based on supreme_court_precedent and the treatment of product-by-process_claims throughout the years by the pto and other binding court decisions this court now restates that` process_terms in product-by-process_claims serve as limitations in determining infringement'
atl
thermoplastics 970 f.2d at 846-47
as noted earlier this holding follows this courts clear statement in in re thorpe that` product by process_claims are limited by and defined by the process'
777 f.2d at 697

more recently the supreme_court has reiterated the broad principle that` [ e ] ach element contained in a patent_claim is deemed material to defining the scope of the patented invention'
warner-jenkinson 520 u.s. at 19 117_s.ct._1040
although warner-jenkinson specifically addressed the doctrine of equivalents this rule applies to claim_construction overall
as applied to product-by-process_claims warner-jenkinson thus reinforces the basic_rule that the process_terms limit product-by-process_claims
to the extent that scripps_clinic is inconsistent with this rule this court hereby expressly overrules scripps_clinic

the dissenting opinions lament the loss of a` right' that has never existed in practice or precedent-the right to assert a product-by-process_claim against a defendant who does not practice the express limitations of the claim
this courts en banc_decision in no way abridges an inventors right to stake claims in product-by-process_terms
instead this decision merely restates the rule that the defining limitations of a claim-in this case process_terms-are also the terms that show infringement

thus this court does not question at all whether product-by-process_claims are legitimate as a matter of form
the legitimacy of this claim_form was indeed a relevant issue in the nineteenth century when ex_parte_painter 1891_c.d._200 200-01 comm r_pat
1891 and some later cases were before the commissioner of patents
however this court need not address that settled issue
the issue here is only whether such a claim is infringed by products made by processes other than the one claimed
this court holds that it is not

the jurisprudence of the court of customs and patent_appeals-a court with virtually no jurisdiction to address infringement_litigation-can shed little light on the enforcement of the only claim limitations that an applicant chooses to define the invention
indeed this courts venerable predecessor expressed its ambivalence towards the relevant infringement_analysis the policy of the patent_office in permitting product-by-process_type_claims to define a patentable product where necessary has developed with full cognizance of the fact that in infringement *1294 suits some courts have construed such_claims as covering only a product made by the particular process set forth in the claim and not to the product per se
in re_bridgeford 53_c.c.p.a._1182 357_f.2d_679 683_n._5_(1966)
the reference to` some courts' in this prior citation as this court notes en banc includes the united_states supreme_court and every circuit court to consider the question including this circuit
see also jon s. saxe & julian s. levitt product-by-process claims and their current status in chemical patent_office practice 42 j. pat
off
soc y 528 530 1960` [ p ] roduct-by-process_claims have met with a most strict interpretation in the courts in infringement proceedings.. [ t ] he courts uniformly hold that only a product produced by the claim-designated process may be held to infringe the claim'
( citing gen._elec co. 304_u.s._364 58_s.ct._899 82_l.ed._1402 and basf 111 u.s. at 310 4_s.ct._455

product-by-process_claims especially for those rare situations when products were difficult or impossible to describe historically presented a concern that the patent_office might deny all product protection to such_claims
see in re_butler 17_c.c.p.a._810 813 37_f.2d_623_(1930)` process claims are valuable and appellant thinks he is entitled to them ; but it is submitted that he should not be limited to control of the process when the article which that process produces is new and useful`
in the modern context however if an inventor invents a product whose structure is either not fully known or too complex to analyze the subject of this case-a product defined by sophisticated pxrd technology-suggests that these concerns may no longer in reality exist this court clarifies that the inventor is absolutely free to use process_steps to define this product
the patent will issue subject to the ordinary requirements of patentability
the inventor will not be denied protection
because the inventor chose to claim the product in terms of its process however that definition also governs the enforcement of the bounds of the patent right
this court can not simply ignore as verbiage the only definition supplied by the inventor

this courts rule regarding the proper treatment of product-by-process_claims in infringement_litigation carries its own simple logic
assume a hypothetical chemical compound defined by process_terms
the inventor declines to state any structures or characteristics of this compound
the inventor of this compound obtains a product-by-process_claim` compound x obtained by process_y'
enforcing this claim without reference to its defining terms would mean that an alleged_infringer who produces compound_x by process_z is still liable for infringement
but how would the courts ascertain that the alleged_infringers compound is really the same as the patented compound ?
after all the patent holder has just informed the public and claimed the new_product solely in terms of a single process
furthermore what analytical tools can confirm that the alleged_infringers compound is in fact_infringing other than a comparison of the claimed and accused infringing_processes ?
if the basis of infringement is not the similarity of process it can only be similarity of structure or characteristics which the inventor has not disclosed
why also would the courts deny others the right to freely practice process_z that may produce a better_product in a better_way ?

in sum it is both unnecessary and logically unsound to create a rule that the process_limitations of a product-by-process_claim should not be enforced in some exceptional instance when the structure of the claimed product is unknown and the product can be defined only by reference to a process by which it can be made
such a rule would expand the protection of *1295 the patent beyond the subject_matter that the inventor has` particularly point [ ed ] out and distinctly claim [ ed ]' as his invention 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
6

thus the eastern_district of virginia correctly applied the rule that the recited process_steps limit the product-by-process_claims 2-5 for any infringement_analysis

3
`` obtainable by' in this case abbotts plain language argument that` obtainable by' introduces an optional process even if` obtained by' would introduce limiting process_steps is also unavailing
the basf case an analogous situation to this case controls
as noted above the supreme_court in basf considered the following claim_language` artificial_alizarine produced from anthracine or its derivatives by either of the methods_herein described or by any other_method which will produce a like_result'
111 u.s. at 296 4_s.ct._455 emphasis added
the patentee argued that even though the defendant did not make artificial_alizarine by` either of the methods_herein described' the claim should capture the product because of the` or by another_method' language
id.at 309 4_s.ct._455
the supreme_court refused to attach importance to those expansive words` no._4321 furnishes no test by which to identify the product it covers except that such product is to be the result of the process it describes'
id.at 305 4_s.ct._455
abbotts claims 2-5 like those in basf and like product-by-process_claims in general do not furnish any test by which to identify the cefdinir_crystals except that they are the result of their respectively claimed processes
as per basf abbotts claim can not capture a product obtained by or obtainable by processes other than those explicitly recited in the claims

if this court were to strip the process_elements from the claims as abbott would urge for infringement purposes there would then be nothing to differentiate independent_claim 2 from independent_claim 5
after all if those claims are not bound by the process_terms but only` define' the basic cefdinir compound then each of the claims recite the same_thing over and over again
though abbott argues that it merely intends to give meaning to the word` obtainable' it instead seeks to have this court render meaningless the explicit process_limitations that the applicant chose to define its invention

the intrinsic_evidence in this case further rebuts abbotts contention that its claims are not limited to those products actually obtained by the processes recited
in column 2 of the ¡¬507_patent under the title heading` the process for preparing crystal_a of the compound i' the patentee used specific language to describe the very two processes that are mirrored in claims 2_and_5
¡¬507_patent col.2 ll.13-51
this language is not open-ended nor does it constitute a mere description of the product by reference to the manner in which it can be made as abbott argues
by drafting claims 2_and_5 to incorporate these specific_processes abbott made a conscious choice to place process requirements on its claimed product
if abbott had wanted to obtain broader coverage for crystalline_cefdinir devoid of any process_limitations as it seeks to do here it could have simply done so if indeed as it argues it is really the product that is the heart of the invention not the process
but it did not
the crystals of claims 2_and_5 are simply not identifiable other than by the processes disclosed in column 2
this court must enforce the ways and terms that a party chooses to define its invention

*1296 the prosecution_history also does not support abbotts contention that` obtainable by' offers merely an optional set of definitional process conditions
during prosecution abbott faced obviousness rejections based on application claims 6-9 which were process_claims that mirrored the very process_limitations of issued claims 2-5
the pto refused to issue the claims until one set of duplicates was cancelled
abbotts action in cancelling claims 6-9 demonstrates its acquiescence to the ptos view that the process_elements of claims 2-5 are critical parts of those claims
in addition in a response to the ptos office action abbott chose to differentiate a cited ¡± 103 reference takaya on the basis that abbotts claimed processes are different
for these reasons the applicants statement in the file_wrapper that` the method of preparation.. is not considered the heart of the present_invention' should not be afforded undue_gravitas
the process_limitations can not be haphazardly jettisoned for an infringement_analysis when they were so important in the patentability analysis

in sum a patentees use of the word` obtainable' rather than` obtained by' can not give it a free pass to escape the ambit of the product-by-process_claiming doctrine
claims that include such ambiguous language should be viewed extremely narrowly
if this court does not require as a precondition for infringement that an accused infringer actually use a recited process simply because of the patentees choice of the probabilistic suffix` able' the very recitation of that process becomes redundant
this would widen the scope of the patentees claims beyond that which is actually invented-a windfall to the inventor at the expense of future_innovation and proper notice to the public of the scope of the claimed invention
for all the above reasons the eastern_district of virginia correctly construed the process_limitations beginning with` obtainable by' in claims 2-5 as limiting the asserted claims to products made by those process_steps

b
summary judgment
in the lupin_case the eastern_district of virginia granted summary_judgment of noninfringement of claims 2-5 both literal and by equivalents and of claim 1 by equivalents
lupin_sj_order
literal infringement of claim 1 i.e. whether lupins generic cefdinir_product contains any crystal_a is therefore not a live issue on appeal
as for claims 2-5 the eastern_district noted that` abbott and astellas have conceded that literal_infringement of claims 2-5 can not be established if the product-by-process analysis is performed pursuant to atlantic_thermoplastics' given that` abbott and astellas have presented no evidence that lupin is practicing the process_steps set forth in claims 2-5'
lupin_sj_order 491 f.supp.2d at 568
because the eastern_district correctly applied the rule from atlantic_thermoplastics and likewise properly construed the limiting process_terms in claims 2-5 only infringement by equivalents of claims 1-5 remains before this court

infringement analysis under the doctrine of equivalents proceeds element-by-element ; a generalized showing of equivalency between the claim as a whole and the allegedly infringing product or process is not sufficient to show infringement
see warner-jenkinson 520 u.s. at 29 117_s.ct._1040` the doctrine of equivalents must be applied to individual elements of the claim not to the invention as a whole'
the primary test for equivalency is the` function-way-result' or` triple identity' test whereby the patentee may show an equivalent when the accused product or process performs substantially the same function in substantially the same_way to achieve substantially the same result as disclosed in the claim
*1297 graver tank & mfg co. v. linde air prods co. 339_u.s._605 608 70_s.ct._854 94_l.ed._1097_(1950)
but because` [ d ] ifferent linguistic frameworks may be more suitable to different cases' warner-jenkinson 520 u.s. at 40 117_s.ct._1040 the function-way-result_test is not the only test for equivalency
equivalency may also be proven where the differences between the invention as claimed and the accused product or process are insubstantial
hilton davis chem co. v. warner-jenkinson_co. 62_f.3d_1512 1517-18 fed.cir.1995 en banc revd on other grounds 520_u.s._17 117_s.ct._1040 137_l.ed.2d_146_(1997)
in no case however may the doctrine of equivalents ignore the individual claim elements
see warner-jenkinson 520 u.s. at 40 117_s.ct._1040 requiring` a special vigilance against allowing the concept of equivalence to eliminate completely any such [ individual ] elements'

because` crystalline' in claims 1-5 is limited to` crystal_a' as defined by the seven pxrd_peaks enumerated in claim 1 and in the specification of the ¡¬ 507 patent the doctrine of equivalents can not capture crystals that are not themselves equivalent to crystal_a
in turn the bounds of crystal_a equivalents can not ignore the limits on crystal_a in the ¡¬507_patent which as discussed above includes a conscious decision to distinguish crystal_b from the claimed invention
to recall the applicant removed crystal_b from the u.s. prosecution of the parent_jp_¡¬199_application
the ¡¬507_patent indisputably describes and claims crystal_a and not crystal_b
the ¡¬507_patent of course could have claimed the known crystal_b_formulation which was known to the inventors because it appeared in their priority_jp_¡¬199_application
the applicants chose not to claim crystal_b
thus crystal_b_compounds most relevantly cefdinir_monohydrate fall outside the scope literal or equivalent of claims 1-5 of the ¡¬507_patent

the parties agree that the` bulk' of lupins cefdinir_product is crystal_b not crystal_a
the degree to which lupins product may or may not also contain crystal_a is the central inquiry regarding the alleged literal_infringement of claim 1 which is not part of the present appeal
abbott can not extend its exclusive right in the ¡¬507 claims under the doctrine of equivalents to embrace known but unclaimed_subject_matter
in other words abbott effectively disclaimed crystal_b during prosecution of the ¡¬507_patent by removing the crystal_b_disclosure from the parent_jp_¡¬199_application and emphasizing the sole teaching of crystal_a in communications with the pto as well as in the ¡¬507_specification itself
abbott can not now recapture that unclaimed_subject_matter under the doctrine of equivalents because the eastern_district properly interpreted claims 2-5 to limit` crystalline' to crystal_a
to expand that claim term to embrace crystal_b would ignore the specific claim limitations of the ¡¬507_patent

alternatively this court notes that this case seems to fit within the dedication doctrine that forecloses invocation of the doctrine of equivalents
the patent applicant clearly knew of the crystal_b forms of the claimed invention because it claimed and disclosed them in its japanese priority application
yet it declined to claim an embodiment expressly disclosed in its priority document thus dedicating that embodiment to the public and foreclosing any recapture under the doctrine of equivalents
see johnson & johnston assocs
v. r.e
serv co. 285_f.3d_1046 1054 fed.cir.2002

during prosecution abbott chose to eschew crystal_b and focus exclusively on crystal_a compounds
without a complete record and no arguments about validity before this court on appeal this court can not speculate on the reasons for this *1298 choice
nonetheless the parties hotly contest whether example 14 which reports obtaining` crystals' not specifically identified or described and/or example 16 of the ¡¬334_patent enable cefdinir_monohydrate i.e
crystal_b type crystals

beyond the attempt to reinflate the claims to encompass crystal_b based on mathematical comparisons of the pxrd peak patterns of crystal_a and crystal_b abbott also asserts that lupin effectively admitted infringement by equivalents when it claimed before the food and drug_administration that its cefdinir generic was a bioequivalent to abbotts omnicef_product
while bioequivalency may be relevant to the function prong of the function-way-result_test bioequivalency and equivalent_infringement are different inquiries
bioequivalency is a regulatory and medical concern aimed at establishing that two compounds are effectively the same for pharmaceutical purposes
in contrast equivalency for purposes of patent_infringement requires an element-by-element comparison of the patent_claim and the accused product requiring not only equivalent function but also equivalent way and result
different attributes of a given product may thus be relevant to bioequivalency but not equivalent_infringement and vice versa
as the northern_district of illinois observed in the sandoz_case` [ i ] f bioequivalency meant per se infringement no alternative to a patented medicine could ever be offered to the public during the life of a patent'
sandoz_pi_order 486 f.supp.2d at 776
thus while potentially relevant the bioequivalency of an accused product with a product produced from the patent at issue is not sufficient to establish infringement by equivalents

because crystal_b is not an equivalent of crystal_a the eastern_district of virginia did not err in granting summary_judgment of noninfringement of claims 2-5 both with respect to literal and equivalent_infringement and with respect to equivalent_infringement of claim 1

iv
this court reviews the grant or denial of a preliminary_injunction for abuse of discretion
amazon.com inc. v. barnesandnoble.com inc. 239_f.3d_1343 1350 fed.cir.2001
a district_court may enter a preliminary_injunction based on its consideration of four factors` 1 the likelihood of the patentees success on the merits ; 2 irreparable harm if the injunction is not granted ; 3 the balance of hardships between the parties ; and 4 the public_interest'
erico int l corp. v. vutec corp. 516_f.3d_1350 1353-54 fed.cir.2008 quoting phg techs. llc v. st. john cos. inc. 469_f.3d_1361 1365 fed.cir.2006

sandoz and tevas omnicef generic products like lupins are also at least primarily cefdinir_monohydrate a crystal_b compound
sandoz_pi_order 486 f.supp.2d at 769
before the northern_district of illinois the parties to the sandoz_litigation disputed whether sandoz and tevas products also contained small_amounts of cefdinir_anhydrate i.e. crystal_a which would fall within the literal_scope of claim 1 of the ¡¬507_patent
working primarily from the eastern_district of virginias claim_construction to which the parties to the sandoz_litigation agreed would bind their litigation as well for purposes of the preliminary_injunction_motion the northern_district of illinois denied abbotts motion for a preliminary_injunction finding that abbott was unlikely to prevail on the merits at trial

this court detects no abuse of discretion in the northern_district of illinois preliminary_injunction denial
as described above the ¡¬507_patent is properly construed to exclude crystal_b both as to *1299 literal and equivalent_infringement
thus this court need not delve into the northern_district of illinois clarifications of the eastern_district of virginias claim_constructions
the northern_district of illinois succinctly concluded` [ w ] e know that crystal_b was known to the plaintiffs because it had been included in the japanese ¡¬199_patent
thus we conclude that the plaintiffs deliberately excluded from the definition of crystal_a cefdinir_monohydrate which is crystal_b'
id.at 775

as to the alleged presence of small_amounts of crystal_a in sandoz and tevas products abbotts evidence did not persuade the northern_district of illinois
id
this court perceives that decision as well within the trial_courts discretion
as additional support the northern_district observed that there was no evidence that any trace amounts of cefdinir_anhydrate i.e
crystal_a in sandoz and tevas products` could be a contributing factor in the efficacy' and that even` if there is a small amount of cefdinir_anhydrate in defendants products we do not conclude that this could cause literal_infringement'
id
while these may be misstatements of the law because de minimis infringement can still be infringement see 35 u.s.c.¡± 271 a ; see also suntiger inc. v. sci
res
funding group 189_f.3d_1327 1336 fed.cir.1999` if a claim reads merely on a part of an accused device that is enough for infringement
`` this court need not reach that issue in a preliminary_injunction context which affords the trial_court broad leeway to discern a` likelihood of success'
likewise the district_court may have overstated the relevance of efficacy because the ¡¬507_patent contains no claim limitations relating to efficacy
but these misstatements were harmless because they merely formed an alternative basis for the northern_district of illinois reasonable assessment of the evidence proffered by abbott for its preliminary_injunction_motion
as noted this court sustains the trial_courts discretion based primarily on its administration of the proper claim_construction and its finding that abbott was not likely to show sandoz and tevas products contained any crystal_a at all

conclusion
the eastern_district of virginia correctly construed the ¡¬507_patents recitation of` crystalline' in each of the asserted claims as limited to crystal_a as outlined in the specification
because abbott scrubbed all references to crystal_b in the ¡¬507_patents specification which were present in the ¡¬507_patents parent foreign application abbott clearly demonstrated its intent to limit the ¡¬507_patent to crystal_a
this intent was further underscored by comments made during prosecution
as such abbott is unable to recapture crystal_b through broad claim_language or under the doctrine of equivalents
the eastern_district of virginia therefore properly concluded on summary_judgment that lupins cefdinir_product did not infringe claims 1-5 literally or claims 2-5 by equivalency
similarly the northern_district of illinois did not abuse its discretion in declining to enter a preliminary_injunction against sandoz and tevas cefdinir_products

newman circuit_judge with whom circuit_judges mayer and lourie join dissenting from en banc section_iii.a.2
the court_today acts en banc to overturn a century of precedent and practice and holds that a new_product that is difficult to describe without reference to how it was made but that is nonetheless a new and unobvious_product can not be protected as *1300 a product if its description is aided by reference to how it was made
heretofore a new_product whose structure was not fully known or not readily described could be patented as a product by including in the product description sufficient reference to how it can be made to distinguish the new_product from prior_art_products
patentability was determined as a product independent of any process reference in the claim and validity and infringement were based on the product itself
this expedient for patenting products whose structure was not fully known at the time of filing the patent_application has been called the` rule of necessity'
it was pragmatic fair and just for it attuned patent_law and practice to the realities of invention

today the court rejects this expedient and discards this practice ruling that all claims containing a process_term under the rule of necessity now must be construed for purposes of infringement as limited to use of any process_term that was used to assist in defining the product
that is such a product is not patented as a product however it is produced but is limited to the process by which it was obtained
this is a new restraint on patents for new_products particularly todays complex chemical and biological_products whose structure may be difficult to analyze with precision
it is a change of law with unknown consequences for patent-based innovation

the court acts sua_sponte without explanation of what policy is intended to be served by this change without consideration of the technologies that may be adversely affected by elimination of this expedient without notice to those whose property_rights may be diminished
in so doing the court departs from statute precedent and practice
this change is as unnecessary as it is flawed gratuitously affecting inventions past present and future
i respectfully dissent

discussion
for most product inventions the process by which the product was made whether or not the process is itself a patentable_invention is not stated in the product_claims
however as the variety and complexity of invention and technology have increased various forms of product_claims with process_terms have been used in specific circumstances depending on the nature of the invention.1 the form here at issue relates to product_claims for new and unobvious_products whose structure is not fully known and for which process parameters are used to aid in defining the product
this claiming expedient has been recognized since at least 1891

the court_today overturns this expedient for all circumstances brooking no exception
acting en banc for the purpose the court rules that if any process_term or descriptive aspect is included in a product_claim to aid in distinguishing a new_product the claim can not be infringed by the identical_product unless the same_process aspect is used in making the accused product
the court holds that it is irrelevant whether the product is new or was known irrelevant whether the product could have been fully described by its structure at the time of the patent_application irrelevant whether the particular invention is a new_product or is actually a process
the court adopts a simplistic universal rule *1301 thereby targeting a small but significant class of inventions
the effect of this decision on innovation in complex fields of science and technology is unknown to the court for we have had no advice on the consequences of this change of law
my dissent is directed as much to the courts procedure as to the substance of the courts decision

i
procedure
the court has given no notice of this impending en banc action contrary to the federal_rules of appellate_procedure and contrary to the federal_circuits own operating procedures
the en banc_court has received no briefing and held no argument although the federal_rules so require
the communities of inventors innovators and the public who may be affected by this change of law have had no opportunity to be heard
the court has received no information concerning the effect on patents that were granted based on this long-established practice no advice on what kinds of inventions may now lie fallow because they are unprotected
nor does the court explain its suspension of the standards of judicial process

the federal_rules have the force of law
28 u.s.c.¡± 2072
federal_rules of appellate_procedure 34_and_35 are here implicated
rule 34 provides that` oral_argument must be allowed in every case' unless certain specific exceptions exist rule 34 a 2 standards
oral argument must be allowed in every case unless a panel of three judges who have examined the briefs and record unanimously agrees that oral_argument is unnecessary for any of the following reasons a the appeal is frivolous ; b the dispositive_issue or issues have been authoritatively decided ; or
( c the facts and legal arguments are adequately presented in the briefs and record and the decisional_process would not be significantly aided by oral_argument
applying the rule 34 standards it is clear that a this appeal is not frivolous and b the dispositive_issue has not been authoritatively decided for it is currently being addressed en banc
there has been c no briefing and no record to the court and this is not a case in which the decisional_process would not be aided by oral_argument
the en banc_court has heard no argument and has received neither written nor oral exploration of the diverse aspects of this long-established claiming practice

federal rule of appellate_procedure 35 has also failed of compliance
that rule recognizes the exceptional nature of en banc_hearing or rehearing and identifies the two circumstances warranting such procedure ¢F=bqp:0132rule 35 a.. an en banc_hearing or rehearing is not favored and ordinarily will not be ordered unless 1 en banc consideration is necessary to secure or maintain uniformity of the courts decisions ; or
( 2 the proceeding involves a question of exceptional_importance
when an en banc_hearing or rehearing is ordered sua_sponte by the court whether for uniformity of decision or on a question of exceptional_importance the hearing or rehearing must receive the appellate process set by the rules

i agree that en banc review is appropriate for this apparent conflict in our precedent has existed since 1992
now that the court has undertaken to resolve the conflict the withholding of public notice or even notice to the parties to this case is devoid of justification
the question is of importance but there has been no assertion *1302 of urgency sufficient to require bypassing the standard appellate procedures
the breadth of the en banc_courts ruling the solidity of the precedent now overruled the importance of the technologies affected and the untold issued patents that are now placed in limbo require this courts compliance with federal_rules 34_and_35

the federal_circuit has recognized that it can benefit from the advice of those knowledgeable in the law and its purposes in the areas of our nation-wide responsibility
patent law has a direct impact on innovation industry and technological advance and when an en banc ruling may change the law affecting some areas of technology and the industries based thereon this court has routinely sought to be informed by the parties and amici curiae of relevant concerns
when the impact of a sua_sponte change of law transcends the interests of the parties to the specific case notice to the interested public as well as to the parties is fundamental to due and fair process
the federal_circuits internal operating procedure iop 14 was adopted to implement these principles iop 14.3 c if the sua_sponte petition for hearing en banc is granted a committee of judges appointed by the chief judge which shall normally include the judge who initiated the poll shall within seven working days fourteen working days between june 21 and september 11 transmit on a vote sheet to the judges who will sit en banc an order setting forth the questions proposed to be addressed by the court en banc
the clerk shall provide notice that a majority of the judges in regular_service has acted under 28 u.s.c.¡± 46 and fed
r.app
p. 35 a to order the appeal to be heard en banc and indicate any questions the court may wish the parties and amici to address
notice shall be given that the court en banc shall consist of all circuit judges in regular_service who are not recused or disqualified
additional briefing and oral_argument will be ordered as appropriate
united_states_court of appeals for the federal_circuit internal operating procedures at 40 available at http //www.cafc.uscourts.gov/pdf/iops 122006.pdf
this iop has not been followed
no notice was given even to the parties that the court had ordered this question to be reheard en banc ; nor did the court advise the parties or the public as to the aspects being addressed for en banc_decision
the court is acting sua_sponte without notice and without argument and without an opportunity for participation
by bypassing this courts standard operating procedure as well as violating the federal_rules of appellate_procedure the court has deprived itself of input concerning the experience of precedent of advice as to how this change of law may affect future_innovation and of guidance as to the effect on existing property_rights

ii
precedent and practice
the courts opinion does not mention the long-established precedent that it is overturning
this is not a simple conflict between isolated rulings of the federal_circuit ; it is a change of law and practice with roots in century-old decisions
i start with this precedent for the expedient of what came to be called the` rule of necessity' originated in the recognition by the courts and the patent_office that not all new_products could be fully described by their structure due to the state of scientific knowledge or available analytical techniques
it was also recognized over a century ago that sufficient distinction from prior_art_products could sometimes be achieved by reference to how the product was made
thus the courts and patent administrators established the exception *1303 that permitted inclusion in a product_claim of sufficient recitation of how the product was made to aid in identifying the product and distinguishing it from the prior_art
this claim_form was loosely called a` product-by-process' form although that term includes a variety of situations see n. 1 supra having diverse legal consequences
the only form here at issue is that in which the product is new and its structure is not fully or readily known such that its definition as a product is aided by referring to how it was made
since before 1891 this has been an accepted way to claim products as products recognizing that this is an exception to the general_rule that new_products are claimed without reference to the process by which they are produced

this exception was discussed in 1891 in ex_parte_painter the commissioner of patents explaining that when there is entitlement to a patent on a new article of manufacture it can be claimed by reference to the process of producing it when the inventor lacks other language to` define and discriminate' the invention it requires no argument to establish the proposition that as a rule a claim for an article of manufacture should not be defined by the process of producing that article
on the other hand when a man has made an invention his right to a patent for it or his right to a claim properly defining it is not to be determined by the limitations of the english language
when the case arises that an article of manufacture is a new thing a useful thing and embodies invention and that article can not be properly defined and discriminated from prior_art otherwise than by reference to the process of producing it a case is presented which constitutes an exception to the rule
1891_c.d._200 200-01 comm r_pat
1891
the commissioner cited as an earlier example of this exception the claim in globe nail co. v. u.s
horse nail co. 19_f._819_(c.c.d.mass.1884) sustaining validity of claim directed to horse-shoe nail claimed by reference to its process of manufacture and finding it infringed by the accused nail having only a` trivial and unsubstantial variation' from the claimed product
in contrast where the patent_application made clear that the product could be described by its structure the patent_office ruled that the exception did not apply
see e.g. ex parte scheckner 1903_c.d._315 315-16 comm r_pat.1903 sustaining rejection of claim directed to an etched printing-plate that` specifies certain steps by means of which the etching is accomplished' because other claims` define the plate in terms of its structure'

this expedient has been discussed in various judicial decisions
in all cases the issue has not been whether this expedient was available for its availability was not challenged ; the issue was simply its application to the particular facts
for example at a time when it heard direct appeals from patent_office rulings the d.c
circuit remarked on this` only_exception' to the general_rule of product_claiming stating it is a well-settled rule of patent_law that claims for a product which is defined by the process of producing it will not be allowed ; and the only_exception to this rule seems to be in cases where the product involves invention and can not be defined except by the process used in its creation
in extreme cases of this character the product may be allowed ; but that is not this case especially in view of the broad claims allowed appellant in his copending application..
in re brown 29_f.2d_873 874 d.c.cir.1928 emphasis added

the court of customs and patent_appeals discussed precedent involving claims *1304 for processes and products in various factual situations and summarized that where it is possible to define a product by its characteristics the practice is clearly settled that this should be done
where however the product is novel and involves invention and can not be defined except by the steps of the process involved in its creation there are cases holding that such a claim may be allowed and it has been sustained by a court
in re_butler 17_c.c.p.a._810 37_f.2d_623 626 1930 emphasis added quoting ex parte feisenmeier 1922_c.d._18_(comm'r_pat.1922)
the ccpa then found this rule inapplicable to the facts of butlers invention explaining that` the record at bar does not meet this requirement [ that the product was new ]'
id

in in re lifton 38_c.c.p.a._1119 189_f.2d_261_(1951) the ccpa again commented on this exception for product_claims stating that when` proper_article_claims' were possible they must be used with the exception of when such_claims are` impossible' this court has uniformly held that a claim for an article must define the article by its structure and not by the process of making it
the one exception to this rule where the invention is the article and it is impossible to otherwise define it is clearly ruled out in the present case because appellant has demonstrated the possibility of proper_article_claims by including several devoid of process_limitations
id.at 263 emphasis added citations omitted
the court again recognized` the one exception' holding once again that it does not apply when the product can be described independently of the process of making it

these inquiries into the facts warranting application of the exception demonstrate that the rule of necessity was seldom applied but was nonetheless recognized both by the courts and the patent_office
decisions of the patent_office board of appeals illustrate the practice
see e.g. ex parte pfenning 65_u.s.p.q._577_(pat.off.bd.app.1945) allowing claim` directed to a product which results from the method of claim 9' in light of applicants argument that` it is impossible in the instant case to define the product adequately in terms of the elements which compose it or in terms of its physical_characteristics' ; ex parte lessig 57_u.s.p.q._129_(pat.off.bd.app.1943) allowing claim for a` product containing vulcanized_rubber' strongly adhered to fibers which` has been prepared by the process of claim 4' because` it is not possible to otherwise distinguish over the art of record'

commentators have explained that this claiming practice became of increasing importance as the complex_sciences blossomed
see e.g. mark d. passler product-by-process patent claims majority of the court of appeals for the federal_circuit forgets purpose of the patent act 49 u. miami l.rev
233 233_n._3_(1994)` such claims are often used by companies to patent complex drug or chemical products whose structure is not completely understood and therefore can only be accurately described by the process through which it is made`
it is well known that the full_structure of some chemical and biological_products is not always known at the time the patent_application is filed
indeed it is a tenet of the scientific method that explanation and theory tend to follow not precede the observation of a development in the science

the ccpa continued to recognize the use of process_terms to aid in describing new_products-the form of claim sometimes called a` pure' product-by-process_claim see n. 1 supra-and repeatedly ruled that such_claims are properly viewed *1305 as product not process claims
the court also disallowed such_claims where the product itself was not novel and unobvious
the court confirmed that such a claim when justified for a novel and unobvious_product is properly construed as encompassing the full scope of a product_claim
for example in in re_bridgeford 53_c.c.p.a._1182 357_f.2d_679 1966 the court again explained that a new_product may be defined by the process of making it if there is no other way to describe the product stressing that` the invention so defined is a product and not a process' id.at 682
the bridgeford court relied on this view of the scope of the product-by-process_claims in a related patent and held unpatentable for double patenting claims that defined the` product per se'
id.at 680
the court explained that product-by-process_claims are true_product_claims and overruled the suggestion in in re freeman 35_c.c.p.a._920 166_f.2d_178 181 1948 that product-by-process_claims are` dependen [ t ].. on process_limitations' and therefore coextensive with process_claims
bridgeford 357 f.2d at 683_n._6` while there is some language in freeman to support the contention that a product-by-process_type_claim differs onlyin scope from a process_type_claim and they thereforeare directed to a single invention 166 f.2d at 181 so far as this is inconsistent with our holding here it must be overruled
``

my colleagues misstate the holding of bridgeford for bridgeford directly contravenes todays holding
in bridgeford the ccpa noted that` some courts' have construed claims with process_steps as limited to the recited process id.at 683_n._5 apparently without inquiring whether the rule of necessity justified full product scope for the invention at issue
the ccpas observation that patents are construed inconsistently in other courts can not be taken as apparently do my colleagues as error by the ccpa
to the contrary the inconsistency among courts led eventually to consolidation.2

again in in re brown 59_c.c.p.a._1036 459_f.2d_531_(1972) the ccpa explained that product-by-process_claims are product_claims not process_claims and that the patentability of the product must be established independently of the process by which it is identified
see id.at 535` [ i ] n spite of the fact that the claim may recite only_process_limitations it is the patentability of the product_claimed and not of the recited process_steps which must be established
``

other decisions discussing application of this expedient to claims directed to complex_new_products include in re pilkington 56_c.c.p.a._1237 411_f.2d_1345 1349 1969` while we are satisfied that the references of record do not anticipate appellants glass or demonstrate that it would be obvious the differences between that glass and the glass of the prior_art do not appear to us to be particularly susceptible to definition by the conventional recitation of properties or structure
`` and in re fessmann 489_f.2d_742 743 ccpa 1974 affirming obviousness rejection of product-by-process_claim directed to a` liquid smoke' product but observing that prior_art compositions` are complex mixtures of the chemical compounds which can be derived from wood' which` defy simple characterization and this fact presumably accounts for the use of product-by-process *1306 claims'
the need for this expedient and the proper scope afforded such_claims is summarized in the treatise walker on patents [ p ] atent rights over a chemical product are typically independent of the process by which the product is made and are particularly valuable because of this fact
this independence is normally accomplished by defining the product in terms of its structural features alone with no reference in the claims to process_steps whatsoever
the state of chemical technology however is sometimes too limited for a structural description of this type to be made
the structure of some chemicals especially those including elaborate polymer chains can not be accurately determined
the same chemicals however may be both economically valuable and technologically reproducible in the sense that they can be reliably made by subjecting a particular_set of raw materials to a particular_set of process_steps

* * * the law reacted to these difficulties by making it easier to obtain traditional product protection over this special class of chemicals
the inventor was allowed to describe such a chemical in terms of how one gained possession of it that is by way of the process_steps by which it was made
once he did so the law preserved to the inventor the fullest measure of product-only protection that it could ; it treated the process recitations as proxies for the direct recitations of structure that could not be made
such a claim was therefore equivalent to one stated in terms of structure only
it would broadly dominate all methods by which the chemical could be made or used
at the same time it carried the same dangers of running afoul of the art it would be anticipated if the chemical had been produced previously even if by a method other than what the inventor disclosed
1 moys walker on patents_¡± 4:74 4th ed.2008 emphases added

the en banc_court appears to misunderstand this precedent for my colleagues now state that` binding case_law' of the court of customs and patent_appeals and the court of claims mandates a single_rule for all claims that contain any process_terms whether the product is novel or known citing in re hughes 496_f.2d_1216 ccpa 1974 for this proposition
however hughes does not state this proposition ; hughes stands for the contrary proposition
in hughes the question was the patentability of claims directed to` shakes' as are used in roofing as follows 12
shakes manufactured from a shake_bolt by the process of making a plurality of cuts into and across the shake_bolt to an extent to establish predetermined tip lengths and splitting the weather end portions of the shakes from the bolt by starting the splits at the inner ends of the cuts and continuing the splits to the end of the bolt
this claim had been rejected as an improper product-by-process_claim on the ground that the product could be described without including process_steps
the hughes_court acknowledged the general_rule against product-by-process_claiming but also explained the` proper_exception to the general_rule' as first set forth in painter as follows [ t ] he commissioner of patents enunciated the general_rule that a product should not be defined in terms of the process of making it
in painter a proper_exception to the general_rule was found on the ground that the product could not be properly defined and discriminated from the prior_art otherwise than by reference to the process of producing it
this basic_rule and the exception *1307 have been recognized and followed continuously by the patent_office and the courts
hughes 496 f.2d at 1218 quoting approvingly the solicitors argument
the court reaffirmed that` in spite of the fact that a product-by-process_claim may recite only_process_limitationsit is the product which is covered by the claim and not the recited process_steps
`` id
contrary to my colleagues statement hughes did not eliminate this form of claim or change its role as a product_claim
indeed the hughes_court applied the exception and reversed the boards rejection of a product-by-process_claim stating we agree with appellant that the [ general ] rule should not be applied to the situation before us
we have been shown no true product_claim which describes appellants invention in the words of the solicitor` in terms of structure or physical_characteristics'
when an applicant seeks to describe his invention by a product-by-process_claim because he finds that his invention is incapable of description solely by structure or physical_characteristics it is incumbent upon the patent_office to indicate where or how the applicants invention is or may be so described
id.at 1219
my colleagues could hardly have selected less apt support for their construction of product-by-process_claims for hughes explicitly states that such_claims are for the product not the process

in addition to misstating precedent of the ccpa the en banc_court also mischaracterizes the decisions of our predecessor the court of claims stating that the court of claims decisions support todays ruling
the court cites tri-wall_containers v. united_states 187_ct.cl._326 408_f.2d_748 1969 for this purpose
that citation too is mysterious for in tri-wall_containers the court found that the claimed product was not` new' because it had been on sale for more than the permitted period although the product that was on sale had been made by a different_process than the process stated in the claim
the court of claims stated that the evidence showed that` the prior_art product and the claimed product are structurally identical' id.at 751 and explained that a known product can not be patented by including process_terms in the claim it is well established that a product_claimed as made by a new_process is not patentable unless the product itself is new
the wood-paper_patent 90 u.s. 23 wall
566 596 23_l.ed._31_(1874) cochrane v. badische_anilin & soda_fabrik [` basf' ] 111_u.s._293 311 4_s.ct._455 28_l.ed._433_(1984).... more recent cases point out that the addition of a method step in a product_claim which product is not patentably distinguishable from the prior_art can not impart patentability to the old_product
jungersen v. baden 69_f.supp._922 928 s.d.n.y.1947 affd 166_f.2d_807_(2d_cir.1948) affd 335_u.s._560 69_s.ct._269 93_l.ed._235_(1949) ; in re stephens 345_f.2d_1020 1023 52_c.c.p.a._1409_(1965)
tri-wall_containers 408 f.2d at 750-51
this case applied the standard rule that old_products can not be patented-it contains no statement limiting the scope of claims that include process aspects to aid in describing new_products
the supreme_court_cases cited in tri-wall are all directed to new_processes for making old_products-these are the same cases that the en banc_court_today incorrectly applies to new_products as i discuss post

contrary to my colleagues statement ccpa and court of claims precedent do not support todays en banc thesis
our predecessor_courts understood the complexity of patenting and the ccpa consistently *1308 implemented the expedient whereby process_terms contributed to the description of complex_new_products of incompletely known structure
these courts recognized the independence of product_claims for new_products and did not limit such_claims to the specific process_steps that were used to aid in describing the product.3

with the advent of the federal_circuit this court continued to apply these principles
in in re thorpe 777_f.2d_695 fed.cir.1985 the court explained that product-by-process_claims are anticipated when the product existed in the prior_art even if the product was made by a different_process
my colleagues are mistaken in stating that thorpe held that all such_claims are to be construed as process_claims even when the product is new and the rule of necessity justifies this mode of describing the invention
in thorpe the product was not new ; it was a known color developer for carbonless paper copy systems and this court held that the pto correctly rejected the claim to` the product of the process of claim 1' explaining that since the product was old it could not be claimed as a product whether or not process_steps are recited in the claim

the facts of thorpe did not concern the exception and expedient where process_terms are invoked to describe a new_product of complex structure
this exception is rarely invoked
the general_rule requiring claims to have a process-free definition of the structure of a new_product accommodates most inventions
some recent exceptions are seen in emerging aspects of biotechnology
for example in amgen inc. v. chugai pharmaceutical co. 706_f.supp._94_(d.mass.1989) affd in relevant part 927_f.2d_1200_(fed.cir.1991) the district_court considered the following claim 4
a procaryotic or eucaryotic host_cell transformed or transfected with a dna sequence according to claim 1 2_or_3 in a manner allowing the host_cell to express erythropoietin
id.at 108
the district_court found claim 4` ambiguous' explaining that while it is directed to a new_product-this host_cell-the words` transformed or transfected' appear to invoke a process
the district_court recognized that` [ i ] n the traditional patent framework a product is wholly separate and distinct from a process'
id.at 107
the court observed that` [ a ] product patent gives the patentee the right to restrict the use and sale of the product regardless of how and by whom it was manufactured' while` [ a ] process patentees power extends only to those products made by the patented_process'
id
( quoting united_states v. studiengesellschaft kohle 670_f.2d_1122 1127-28 d.c.cir.1981
the district_court affirmed by the *1309 federal_circuit found this claim to be valid and infringed as a product_claim and although many issues and arguments were present in this litigation the applicability of the venerable rule of necessity was not at issue

in scripps_clinic & research_foundation v. genentech inc. 927_f.2d_1565 fed.cir.1991 the federal_circuit addressed the interpretation and scope of claims exemplified by claim 13 13
highly purified and concentrated_viii c prepared in accordance with the method of claim 1
claim 1 set forth the method referred to in claim 13 as follows 1
an improved method of preparing factor_viii procoagulant activity protein [ viii c ] comprising the steps of
( a adsorbing a viii c/viii rp complex from a plasma or commercial concentrate source onto particles bound to a monoclonal antibody specific to viii rp b eluting the viii c c adsorbing the viii c obtained in step b in another adsorption to concentrate and further purify same d eluting the adsorbed viii c and
( e recovering highly purified and concentrated_viii c. it was not disputed that the product was a new_product that the` highly purified and concentrated' blood clotting factor_viii c had not previously been obtained and that a complete structural identification of factor_viii c was not available
the defendant genentech had made its commercial factor_viii c not by the method set forth in claim 1 but by using a sample of the scripps product to` clone' factor_viii c protein using recombinant dna techniques
one question presented in the case was whether claims such as claim 13 were infringed by the same_product produced by a different_method or whether such_claims were infringed only if the accused infringer used the process of claim 1

scripps stressed that its product was novel and enabled and was patentable as a product although the full_structure of factor_viii c was not available at that stage of the science
the court addressed whether claims exemplified by claim 13 properly construed were product_claims or whether they were limited to the specific_processes in the process_claims to which they referred
this court held that the claims were product_claims
the court held that since claims are construed the same_way for infringement as for validity the question was whether the genentech product was the same as the claimed product not whether they were produced by the same_process
the court remanded to the district_court for this factual determination
scripps 927 f.2d at 1584

after scripps was decided a panel of this court decided an appeal concerning plastic innersoles for shoes
in atlantic_thermoplastics_co. v. faytex_corp. 970_f.2d_834_(fed.cir.1992) the claims at issue were represented by claim 24
the product produced by the method of claim 1
in turn claim 1 was as follows 1
in a method of manufacturing a shock-absorbing molded_innersole for insertion in footwear which method comprises a introducing an expandable polyurethane into a mold ; and
( b recovering from the mold an innersole which comprises a contoured heel and arch section composed of a substantially open-celled_polyurethane_foam_material the improvement which comprises i placing an elastomeric insert_material into the mold the insert_material having greater shock-absorbing *1310 properties and being less resilient than the molded open-celled_polyurethane_foam_material and the insert_material having sufficient surface tack to remain in the placed position in the mold on the introduction of the expandable_polyurethane_material so as to permit the expandable_polyurethane_material to expand about the insert_material without displacement of the insert_material ; and
( ii recovering a molded_innersole with the insert_material having a tacky surface forming a part of the exposed bottom surface of the recovered innersole
the panel held that a claim in the form of claim 24 always requires use of the referenced method and that it is irrelevant whether the product was new or known
the court stated that the rule of necessity as applied in scripps is contrary to supreme_court rulings
the panel stated that the decision in scripps is incorrect
a majority of the federal_circuit declined to resolve the conflict en banc resulting in several further opinions
e.g. atlantic_thermoplastics_co. v. faytex_corp. 974_f.2d_1279_(fed.cir.1992) dissents of chief judge nies and judges rich newman and lourie from denial of rehearing en banc
judge rich wrote [ t ] his whole excursion was unnecessary because the patentee admitted that claim 24 the product-by-process_claim was limited to the process
the claim read` the molded_innersole produced by the method of claim 1'
there was therefore no occasion to review the law to determine how the claim should be construed.. we are not here to provide restatements of the law
such restatements should not be made without an opportunity for all affected parties to be heard from
the affected parties here are not the vendors of inner soles but largely the entire chemical industry particularly the pharmaceutical manufacturers
id.at 1280 rich j. dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc

most trial_courts continued to recognize the rule of necessity
for example in trustees of columbia university v. roche diagnostics gmbh 126_f.supp.2d_16_(d.mass.2000) the district_court considered claims such as the following
72
a eukaryotic cell into which foreign dna i has been inserted in accordance with the process of claim 54
the court referred to the scripps/atlantic conflict concluded that the earlier panel decision controlled under the federal_circuits rule see newell companies inc. v. kenney manufacturing co. 864_f.2d_757 765 fed.cir.1988` this court has adopted the rule that prior decisions of a panel of the court are binding precedent on subsequent panels unless and until overturned in banc
`` and applied the scripps ruling holding that the new cell was not limited by the process by which it was made

the pto also continued to apply the rule of necessity
in instructing examiners that products should whenever possible be described without reference to how they were made the pto continued to point out the exception that patentability as a product is not foreclosed when independent_description is not available
the manual of patent examining procedure mpep instructs the examiner to consider the structure implied by any process_steps in the claim the structure implied by the process_steps should be considered when assessing the patentability of product-by-process_claims over the prior_art especially where the product can only be defined by the process_steps by which the product is made or where the manufacturing_process_steps would be expected to impart *1311 distinctive structural characteristics to the final product
mpep ¡± 2113 8th ed. july 2008 rev
this has been the practice since at least ex_parte_painter in 1891
i am surprised at the en banc_courts casual misstatement about` the treatment of product-by-process_claims throughout the years by the pto' maj. op.at 1293 for the statement is directly contrary to the treatment of such_claims throughout the years by the pto

the en banc_courts insistence that one universal rule should now be applied is contrary to the entire_body of decisional law including the supreme_court_cases cited by my colleagues
as i next discuss in most of the cited cases the product was not a new_product and thus was not patentable as a product whether or not any process_term was included in the claim
the court consistently held that when the product was old and only the process was a patentable_invention a claim for the` product of that process' could not cover the old_product made by a different_process
that is and has always been the law
i comment briefly on the courts cases that my colleagues misinterpret and misapply

cochrane v. basf
the en banc opinion relies primarily on cochrane v. badische_anilin & soda_fabrik 111_u.s._293 4_s.ct._455 28_l.ed._433_(1884)` basf` even though my colleagues acknowledge that the product in that case was the well-known dye alizarine
the patent before the court was a reissue_patent that claimed artificial_alizarine in the following way artificial_alizarine produced by either of the methods_herein described or by any other_method which will produce a like_result
the court held that since alizarine was a known product the claim was limited to the patentees two processes stating it was an old_article
while a new_process for producing it was patentable the product itself could not be patented even though it was a product made artificially for the first_time in contradistinction from being eliminated from the madder_root
calling it artificial_alizarine did not make it a new composition of matter and patentable as such by reason of its having been prepared artificially for the first_time from anthracite if it was set forth as alizarine a well-known substance
wood-paper_patent 23_wall._566 593 [ 23_l.ed._31_(1874) ]
there was therefore no foundation for reissue no._4321 for the product because on the description given no patent for the product could have been taken out originally
111 u.s. at 311-12 4_s.ct._455
the court accordingly limited the claim to the two processes described in the patent and in the portion of basf quoted by my colleagues the court discussed the proofs needed to show infringement [ u ] nless it is shown that the process of [ the specification ] was followed to produce the defendants article or unless it is shown that the article could not be produced by any other_process the defendants article can not be identified as the product of the process of [ the specification ]
nothing of the kind is shown
id.at 310 4_s.ct._455
the court did not state or imply despite my colleagues contrary theory that a claim to a new and complex product that is of necessity defined and distinguished by the process by which it was made can never be infringed unless that specific process is practiced
there was no issue in basf of a product that could not be defined without reference to how it was made
the basf court providing guidance remarked on the importance of independent_description of a *1312 patented product in the following sentence cited by my colleagues every patent for a product or composition of matter must identify it so that it can be recognized aside from the description of the process for making it or else nothing can be held to infringe the patent which is not made by that process
id.at 310 4_s.ct._455
this statement is indeed the general_rule as stated by the patent commissioner several years later in ex_parte_painter
however basf did not present the situation for which the expedient of necessity was created for as the court stated the invention was` a process for preparing alizarine not as a new_substance prepared for the first_time but as the substance already known as alizarine to be prepared however by the new_process which process is to be the subject of the patent and is the process of preparing the known product alizarine from anthracine'
id.at 308-09 4_s.ct._455

this was not an instance of a new_product describable only in terms of its process of manufacture
the basf decision lends no support to todays en banc rule that every product_claim that mentions a process_step is always restricted to that process with no exception no expedient no preservation of the distinctions among forms of claim based on the nature of the invention

the goodyear_dental_cases
the en banc_court also states that its new ruling is supported by two cases relating to a patent on the use of vulcanized_rubber to form a plate for holding dentures smith v. goodyear_dental_vulcanite_co. 93 u.s. 3 otto 486 23_l.ed._952_(1876) and goodyear_dental_vulcanite_co. v. davis 102 u.s. 12 otto 222 26_l.ed._149_(1880)
review of these cases reveals no support for the en banc_courts statement of their holdings
the claim at issue was the plate of hard rubber or vulcanite or its equivalent for holding artificial teeth or teeth and gums substantially as described
davis 102 u.s. 12 otto at 223
the claim was written in the then-standard format of incorporating the description in the specification through the phrase` substantially as described'
this was not a product-by-process or product-of-the-process_claim at all for the claim contains no process distinction or limitation but simply refers to the description in the specification
nonetheless the en banc_majority appears to state that these cases mean that the supreme_court requires that all claims for products whose method of production is set forth in the specification-as is required by the description and enablement requirement- can not be infringed unless that method is used

that is not what the goodyear_dental_cases said
the court referred to the position of goodyear dental vulcanite that its patent covered all dental_plates made of vulcanized_rubber and held upon reviewing the specification and the prior_art that the process of manufacture was what distinguished this dental_plate from the prior_art dental_plates and concluded` the invention then is a product or manufacture made in a defined manner
it is not a product alone separated from the process by which it is created'
smith 93 u.s. 3 otto at 493
were the claim not limited to this process the court concluded that the claim would not have been patentable
see id.at 492 holding that if the patent were for a` mere substitution of vulcanite for other materials which had previously been employed as a base for artificial sets of teeth' then it` constituted no invention'
four years later considering the same_patent in davis the court emphasized *1313 that the claim was limited to use of vulcanized_rubber or its equivalent and held that since the accused infringer made its dental_plate with celluloid there could not be infringement
see 102 u.s. 12 otto at 228-30

the court_today cites these cases as definitive of the interpretation of claims with process_elements although the only process referent is the phrase` substantially as described'
this flawed reasoning was disposed of in 1890 in the classic robinson on patents and until now has not reappeared in stating claims certain phrases are frequently employed to which a special importance seems to be attached by applicants
among these are the phrase` substantially as described' and others of the same_meaning
these phrases import the same_thing when used in a claim as when elsewhere employed
they are neither necessary nor technical
the reference they make to the description is always implied and relates only to the essential features of the invention as therein delineated
they add nothing therefore to the certainty of the claim nor do they detract from it unless the claimant carelessly inserts them as a substitute for a more clear and definite_statement of his invention
ii w.c. robinson robinson on patents 517 1890 footnotes omitted

merrill v. yeomans
my colleagues also rely on merrill v. yeomans 94 u.s. 4 otto 568 24_l.ed._235_(1877)
again the relevance is remote
the merrill_court explained that the issue was the` correct_construction of plaintiffs patent' id.at 569 construing the following claim [ t ] he above-described new_manufacture of the deodorized heavy hydrocarbon_oils suitable for lubricating and other purposes free from the characteristic odors of hydrocarbon_oils and having a slight smell like fatty oil from hydrocarbon_oils by treating them substantially as hereinbefore described
id.at 570
the court examined the specification to determine what was invented and found that the invention was directed solely to a process not to a product
the court then concluded that the claims usage` new_manufacture' referred to the manufacturing_process and not to the product
the claim was thus a process_claim and no` product-by-process' issue was presented
the court concluded that the defendants oil which was made by a different_process did not infringe

the merrill_court discussed its practice of looking to the patent_application and interpreting the claim in light of what was` really invented' [ w ] here it appears that a valuable invention has really been made this court giving full effect to all that is found in the application on which the patent_office acted will uphold that which was really invented and which comes within any fair interpretation of the patentees assertion of claim
id.at 573
this approach is inimical to the en banc_courts theory that it is irrelevant what the patentee describes as his invention and that if a process_step is mentioned in the claim or` substantially described' in the specification the claim always requires performance of that step
although the court in merrill was not confronted with a situation of indescribable product or necessity bred of complexity-indeed no product at all was claimed-neither did the court hold that every product invention must be limited by the process that produced the product

the wood paper_patent case
the list of supreme_court_cases relied on by my colleagues continues with *1314 the wood-paper_patent 90_u.s._566 596 23_wall._566 23_l.ed._31_(1874) where claims with the standard` substantially as described' language were construed in two reissue_patents relating to the pulping of wood to make paper
the court explained that one reissue_patent was for` a product or manufacture and not for the process by which the product may be obtained' and the other` for a process and not for its product'
id.at 593
the court examined the prior_art and concluded that the claim for the product could not be sustained because the product produced by the inventors new pulping process was not new paper-pulp obtained from various vegetable substances was in common use before the original_patent was granted to watt & burgess and whatever may be said of their process for obtaining it the product was in no sense new
the reissued patent no._1448 is therefore void for want of novelty in the manufacture patented
id.at 596
the court then discussed the reissue_patent for the` process and not for its product' and held this reissue void because it claimed a different invention than in the original_patent
the court also discussed several other patents directed to boilers used to produce paper-pulp and to a process for bleaching straw
nothing in this case concerns the product-by-process issue on which the court is today acting

i can not discern why the en banc_court relies on the wood-paper_patent case as invalidating scripps and the court has not attempted to explain

plummer v. sargent
the en banc_court also relies on plummer v. sargent 120_u.s._442 7_s.ct._640 30_l.ed._737_(1887) which again provides no support for my colleagues thesis
this case again illustrates the courts practice of reviewing what the patentee stated he invented as set forth in the specification in light of the prior_art
the claim in plummer was for a` new_manufacture'` substantially as described' what i claim and desire to procure by letters patent is the new_manufacture hereinabove described consisting of iron ornamented in imitation of bronze by the application of oil and heat substantially as described
id.at 445 7_s.ct._640
the trial_court had found non-infringement because the defendant had used a prior_art process for bronzing iron
this prior process was work of f.w
brocksieper an employee of the defendants predecessor company
the supreme_court affirmed stating that the claims were limited to the process described in the specification it seems necessarily to follow from this view either that the tucker patents are void by reason of anticipation practiced by brocksieper or that the patented_process and product must be restricted to exactly what is described.. id.at 449 7_s.ct._640
the court thus limited the claims to the process described by the patentee not because of any rule about limiting a product to how it was made in the specification but to sustain validity of the patent in view of the brocksieper prior_art
the decision in plummer is unrelated to any rule of claim_construction based on whether process_terms are included in the claim

these nineteenth-century cases do not relate to the en banc_courts new universal rule of claim_construction whereby all product_claims having process_terms are treated as process_claims whatever the nature of the product whatever the need for process_descriptors or any other factor that precedent shows to be relevant to the exception that is here at issue as to the use of and construction of such_claims
nor do any more recent court cases

general electric v. wabash
my colleagues also cite *1315 general electric co. v. wabash_appliance_corp. 304_u.s._364 58_s.ct._899 82_l.ed._1402_(1938) although the relevance of this case is again not apparent for it involved no product-by-process_claims but rather claims that recite the properties of the product
a typical claim is claim 25 which describes an electric lamp filament composed of tungsten grains of a size and shape that prevents sagging of the filament 25
a filament for electric incandescent lamps or other devices composed substantially of tungsten and made up mainly of a number of comparatively large grains of such_size and contour as to prevent substantial_sagging and offsetting during a normal or commercially useful life for such a lamp or other device
id.at 368 58_s.ct._899
the court held this claim` invalid on its face' for failing to provide a` distinct and definite_statement of what he claims to be new and to be his invention'
id.at 369 58_s.ct._899
the court stated that the description of the grains as` of such_size and contour as to prevent substantial_sagging and offsetting' was` inadequate as a description of the structural characteristics of the grains'
id.at 370 58_s.ct._899
the court also criticized the use of functional language in the claim stating that such terms were too indefinite to provide clear guidance
id.at 371 58_s.ct._899
there was no issue of whether process_steps in the claims were regarded as limiting for there were no process_steps in the claims
instead the court stated that even the implicit inclusion of process_steps could not save the claim because the description of the process in the specification was inadequate even assuming that definiteness may be imparted to the product_claim by that part of the specification which purportedly details only a method of making the product the description of the pacz process is likewise silent as to the nature of the filament product
id.at 373 58_s.ct._899
the court held the patent invalid for lack of a` distinct and definite' description of the invention for the court` doubted whether one who discovers or invents a product he knows to be new will ever find it impossible to describe some aspect of its novelty'
id
whatever the inadequacies in the pacz description of his invention the courts optimistic view of scientific capability can not be deemed to have barred all recourse to the rule of necessity when it is warranted or to have voided the ensuing seventy-one years of patent_office and judicial recognition of this pragmatic expedient

no supreme_court case discussed the problems of complexity and structural analysis that warrant this expedient or created a legal solution to these problems
it is inappropriate unsupported by law or precedent and contrary to the purposes of patent systems for this court now to rule that such products can not be patented as products

regional circuit decisions
my colleagues also rely on some decisions of the regional circuits preceding this courts formation announcing that` our sister_circuits also followed the general_rule that the defining process_terms limit product-by-process_claims' and citing two cases one decided in 1915 and one in 1977
these cases do not support the en banc_courts opinion,4 and raised no issue of an expedient based on necessity

*1316 in hide-ite leather co. v. fiber products co. 226_f._34 1st cir.1915 the appeal was of two process_claims for making leatherboard and a product_claim for leatherboard` made from pulp' and reciting the second step in the process_claims plus the reference` substantially as described'
the accused infringer did not use the same first step of the process
the court found that the invention was for a process not a product and therefore that the product_claim was not infringed

my colleagues also cite paeco inc. v. applied_moldings inc. 562_f.2d_870 876 3d cir.1977 in which the court used the specification to resolve an ambiguity in the language of a product_claim relating to` replica wooden beams' made of foamed urethane
the court reviewed whether ambiguous claim_language required a closed or open_mold for this determined the question of anticipation based on a prior_art reference that used an open_mold
thus the court stated that the manufacturing_process described in the specification was` of paramount importance' and construed the claim in light of that process as requiring a closed mold thus preserving the claims validity as against the prior_art that used and open_mold
the sentence quoted by my colleagues out of its context does not relate to the en banc_courts new rule concerning process_terms in product_claims and the paeco case raised no question of whether the product was capable of description apart from the process

in addition to these two cases inaptly cited by the en banc_court other regional circuit decisions also contradict this courts new thesis
in dunn wire-cut lug brick co. v. toronto fire clay co. 259_f._258_(6th_cir.1919) the court stated` certain it is in view of the weight of authority and the latest decisions that the inventor of a new and useful product or article of manufacture may have a patent which covers it and gives a monopoly upon it regardless of great variations in the method of making'
id.at 261

in buono v. yankee maid dress corp. 77_f.2d_274_(2d_cir.1935) l.hand j
) the court held invalid a product_claim for a kind of` blind stitch' used in sewing because the invention lay only in the process of producing the stitch which itself` was not new'
id.at 279
while the stitch had not been claimed as the product of a particular machine or process the court remarked on the conceivability of patenting such a product` merely as the product of a machine or process even though it were anticipated if made in other ways' id. observing that such a claim might serve a useful purpose in protecting against products that were produced by the same machine or process abroad and then imported
of such a claim wherein the product itself was anticipated but the process was new the court stated` it would in that case not be infringed by anything but the product of the..
process'
id
this routine statement of established *1317 law does not mean that when the product is itself new and useful and unobvious it can not be claimed as a product but must be tied to the machine that made it

judge hand emphasized that this example related only to situations where the product itself was not new
the opinion explained that to be claimed as a product the product` must be new as such that is regardless of the process or machine which makes it ; and it must stand upon its own invention again independently of the machine or process which makes it'
id
this was also the ccpas view of product_claims providing the precedent carried forward to and binding upon the federal_circuit.5

iii
the en banc ruling
defying precedent the en banc_court adopts for all situations` the basic_rule that the process_terms limit product-by-process_claims' maj. op.at 1293 whether the product is novel or known and whether or not the new_product could not have been fully described by its structure alone
the court eliminates the long-accepted expedient for new_products whose structure is not fully known
while the scripps decision is the only decision that is mentioned as` expressly overruled' maj. op.at 1293 scripps is only one of many cases now discarded

the en banc_majoritys response to the dissenters is to state that` the inventor is absolutely free to use process_steps to define this product' if its` structure is either not fully known or too complex to analyze' maj. op.at 1294 but to eliminate the premise that the inventor thereby obtains a product_claim not a process_claim
according to the majority a patentee can continue to obtain product_claims using process_descriptors but such product_claims are treated as process_claims for infringement
the applicant would still have to demonstrate patentability of the new_product as a product independent of the process while enforcement of the patent against an identical_product would be limited to the infringers use of the process_steps used as a descriptor
for the first_time claims are construed differently for validity and for infringement

it has been an inviolate rule that patent_claims are construed the same_way for validity and for infringement
see e.g. amgen inc. v. hoechst marion roussel inc. 314_f.3d_1313 1330 fed.cir.2003` it is axiomatic that claims are construed the same_way for both invalidity and infringement
`` ; amazon.com inc. v. barnesandnoble.com inc. 239_f.3d_1343 1351 fed.cir.2001` because the claims of a patent measure the invention at issue the claims must be interpreted and given the same_meaning for purposes of both validity and infringement_analyses
`` ; c.r
bard inc. v. m3 systems inc. 157_f.3d_1340 1363 fed.cir.1998` claims must be interpreted the same_way for determining infringement as was done to sustain their validity
`` ; southwall technologies inc. v. *1318 cardinal ig co. 54_f.3d_1570 1576 fed.cir.1995` claims may not be construed one way in order to obtain their allowance and in a different way against accused infringers
`` ; beachcombers international inc. v. wildewood creative products inc. 31_f.3d_1154 1163 fed.cir.1994` we have already interpreted the claims for purposes of assessing their validity
the same claim interpretation of course applies to the infringement_analysis
`` ; scripps_clinic & research_foundation v. genentech inc. 927_f.2d_1565 1583 fed.cir.1991` claims must be construed the same_way for validity and for infringement' ; smithkline diagnostics inc. v. helena laboratories corp. 859_f.2d_878 882 fed.cir.1988` the claims of the ¡¬970_patent measure the invention at issue ; thus the claims must be interpreted and given the same_meaning for purposes of both validity and infringement_analyses
`` ; see also 5a chisum on patents_¡± 18.01 2007` a fundamental tenet of patent_law is that a claim must be interpreted consistently for purposes of infringement and validity
`` ; id.¡± 18.03 [ 2 ] [ h ] collecting cases

as interpreted for validity the claims obtained under the expedient of necessity are product_claims and are subject to the requirements of novelty unobviousness and all other requirements for new_products independent of how the products can be made
my colleagues hold that these are product_claims for validity but process_claims for infringement
departure from the rule that forbids such deviation requires sound reason and fuller exploration than the cursory brush-off dispensed by my colleagues

i do agree with my colleagues that their logic is` simple'
maj. op.at 1294
however todays inventions are not simple
the needs of inventions of the past and present and more so the future are not simple
the public_interest in invention and development of todays complex_sciences is not simple
the en banc_courts` simple' hypothetical about` compound_x obtained by process_y' is simply irrelevant to the issues we must resolve
scientists know that it is often easier to show that two products are the same than to decipher their chemical or biological structure ; for example in the case at bar comparing the x-ray diffraction patterns and absorption spectra could show that the products are the same although their exact crystal structure is undefined
however my colleagues announce that the only way to establish whether the accused compound is the same as the patented compound is by inquiring whether they were prepared by the same method
maj. op.at 1293-94` [ w ] hat analytical tools can confirm that the alleged_infringers compound is in fact_infringing other than a comparison of the claimed and accused infringing_processes ?`
that question has many answers now stated to be irrelevant

while the section of this opinion decided by the en banc_court is largely directed to its reversal of precedent the implementation of its ruling remains with the original panel
the panel decision enlarges the en banc ruling further binding this court
the claims at issue state processes by which the new crystal form is` obtainable' although the specification states that other_methods might be used
the panel rules that a claim` can not capture a product obtained by or obtainable by processes other than those explicitly recited in the claims'
maj. op.at 1295 finding authority in basf which i have discussed ante
my colleagues thus continue to misapply the courts ruling in basf where the court stated repeatedly that the product in that case was a known product
basf 111 u.s. at 311 4_s.ct._455` it was an old_article`
in basf the court responded to the patentees argument that it was entitled to cover all artificial_alizarine *1319 made by any process by observing that the patentee had not shown how the infringing and patented products` can be recognized' id.at 310 4_s.ct._455 an aspect at the opposite pole from the case at bar where the patentee provided elaborate details as to how the patented and accused crystal forms can be recognized

the panel also states that` the applicants statement in the file_wrapper thatthe method of preparation.. is not considered the heart of the present_invention should not be afforded undue_gravitas'
maj. op.at 1296
this too is an aberration of precedent and is contrary to the many rulings of the supreme_court and this court that afford due gravitas to the applicants statement of what has been invented
see e.g. basf 111 u.s. at 308 4_s.ct._455` it is very plain that the specification of the original_patent no
95,465 states the invention to be a process for preparing alizarine not as a new_substance prepared for the first_time but as the substance already known as alizarine to be prepared however by the new_process which process is to be the subject of the patent..' ; plummer v. sargent 120 u.s. at 443 7_s.ct._640 quoting specification of companion patent where inventor stated` my invention consists in a process of covering iron with a very thin coating of oil and then subjecting it to heat the effect of which is to leave upon the iron a firm film which is very durable and gives the iron a highly ornamental appearance like that of bronze'
the federal_circuits emphasis on the importance of the specification has been repeatedly stated
e.g. phillips v. awh_corp. 415_f.3d_1303 1315 fed.cir.2005 en banc` [ t ] he specification is always highly relevant to the claim_construction_analysis
usually it is dispositive ; it is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term'
( internal quotation marks omitted

the en banc_court appears to misjudge the implications of its ruling for the court states that it is now making available to` others the right to freely practice process_z [ a different_process ] that may produce a better_product in a better_way'
maj. op.at 1294
if others can indeed make a better_product this expedient presents no impediment
that is not the issue of this case
the issue is the right to make the same_product by making a process change that does not change the product
by now assuring that right the exclusionary value of the claim to a new_product is lost

the purpose of the rule of necessity is to allow inventors of complex_new_products to obtain the patent_scope to which their invention is entitled-the scope of the novel product they invented no more and no less
the majoritys change of law simply imposes unfairness as well as legal error on patent-supported advances

summary
precedent establishes that the correct_construction of claims that recite process_steps depends like all claim_construction on what has been invented
no single_rule fits all inventions
the construer must view the claims in light of the description of the invention in the specification the prior_art and the prosecution_history
in the complex law and practice of patents and inventions the special expedient here of concern arises when the precise structure of a new_product is not known from the information available when the patent_application was filed
the law has enabled and endorsed this expedient of describing a product in order to claim it as a product whereby validity and infringement are determined as a product independent of any process_term that was used to aid in defining the product
this expedient does not enlarge patent_scope ; it simply permits patenting what has been invented
a narrow *1320 but clear body of law has evolved to accommodate this need of complex technologies
this entire_body of law is today overturned sua_sponte and without a hearing without any participation of those affected without identification of the intended benefits
i respectfully dissent from the en banc_courts rulings as well as the procedure by which they were reached

lourie circuit_judge dissenting from en banc section iii
a
2
i respectfully dissent from the courts en banc holding in section iii
a
2 that product-by-process_claims always require use of the recited process in order to be infringed

i agree that there is substantial supreme_court_precedent that holds that product-by-process_claims require use of the recited process for there to be infringement
however many of those cases applied overly broad_language to fact situations involving old_products or used vague language that makes it difficult to determine whether the products were old or new
clearly however when a product is old a product-by-process_claim can not be interpreted as a claim to the product made by any means
the product is old and unpatentable per se
basf in fact involved an old_product
see cochrane v. badische_anilin & soda_fabrik 111_u.s._293 311 4_s.ct._455 28_l.ed._433_(1884)` it was an old_article
``

there is arguably a different situation that should apply to chemical-biological_products today than to mechanical products of more than a century ago
when a product is new and the inventor claims it by a process of preparation i fail to see why the product-by-process_claim should not be interpreted as a product_claim that can be infringed even when the product is made by means other than that recited in the claim
supreme_court_precedent dealing with old_products while utilizing broad_language does not foreclose that possibility
the court years ago did not have occasion to consider todays innovations or decide whether a distinction should be made between a new chemical-biological product and an old_product made by a new_process

and there may be differing results depending upon the exact wording of a claim at issue
for example a claim reading` when made by' might only be infringed when the recited process is used by the accused as it is situational
on the other hand a claim reading` obtainable by' refers to capability so it might not require use of the process to infringe
`` obtained by' is ambiguous
bright lines have their uses but judging should take account of differing circumstances
in addition of course in order to sustain any claim for infringement a patent owner must prove that an accused product is the same as that covered by an asserted claim
if the reason a product was claimed by its process was that its structure was unknown then if at the time infringement is asserted there still is no means to ascertain structurally whether the accused product is the same as that claimed the infringement claim fails
however that should not mean that a new_product_claimed by a process of preparation can not ever be infringed when made by another_process

it may be that with todays analytical techniques there is little need for product-by-process_claims
after all claim 1 of the abbott patent is a claim to a compound not only by name but also by certain of its characteristics
a claim to a product defined by its characteristics or properties surely is a proper claim

however product-by-process issues still seem to come before us and i would make a distinction between old_products and new_products in interpreting product-by-process *1321 claims
accordingly i respectfully dissent from the courts en banc holding

the en banc_court impugns the ccpas experience
maj. op.at 1293 stating that the ccpa had` virtually no jurisdiction to address infringement_litigation'
the ccpa for many years addressed infringement_litigation in appeals from the international trade commission and its predecessor tribunals
e.g. sealed air corp. v. int l trade comm n 68_c.c.p.a._93 645_f.2d_976_(1981) issues of validity and infringement ; hale fire pump co. v. tokai ltd. 67_c.c.p.a._121 614_f.2d_1278_(1980) issues of validity scope and infringement ; in re orion 22_c.c.p.a._149 71_f.2d_458_(1934) issues of jurisdiction and infringement
our predecessors legal and scholarly distinction in the field of patent_law and the high regard in which congress and the innovation communities held the jurisprudence of the ccpa were a critical foundation for formation of the federal_circuit and its charge to reinvigorate the role of the patent system in service to the nations technological innovation

23,462 1979 statement of sen. deconcini` it is a reflection of high esteem which congress has for the sitting judges of the court of claims and court of customs and patent_appeals that these judges will become the first judges of the new court of the federal_circuit`

it is curious to observe this en banc_court extolling decisions of the regional circuits as authoritative while it disregards the decisions of our predecessor_courts and of this court
this court was created to remove patent_law questions from the regional circuit courts
see h.r
rep. 96-1300 at 20 1980` directing patent appeals to the new court will have the beneficial effect of removing these unusually complex technically difficult and time-consuming cases from the dockets of the regional courts of appeals.. [ t ] he central purpose is to reduce the widespread lack of uniformity and uncertainty of legal doctrine that exist in the administration of patent_law

friendly` what is needed is a group of judges some but not all patent_lawyers with scientific training and interest aided both by law clerks of similar bent and by a staff of experts in a variety of technologies such as the court of customs and patent_appeals has had for years and the courts of appeals in the very nature of things can not..'
to cite two regional circuit decisions while jettisoning the precedents of the court uniquely qualified to address patent questions and selected to supplant the regional circuits is puzzling

soc y 528 559 1960` except in the chemical arts a claim to a product must be in terms of the products objective physical and chemical characteristics ; but where these are unknown or impossible to express a claim may define a product in terms of the process by which it is made
this product-by-process exception is to be distinguished from the use of process_terminology as descriptive of a state of being
