plaintiff hoffmann-la roche inc.` roche' appeals from the decision of the united_states_district_court for the district of new_jersey granting the defendant generic drug companies summary_judgment of invalidity as to claims 1-8 of u.s._patent_no._7718,634` the ¡¬634_patent` and claims 1-10 of u.s._patent_no._7410,957` the ¡¬957_patent`
we affirm

i
the patents at issue in this appeal are directed to methods of treating osteoporosis through the once monthly_administration of ibandronate one of a class of compounds known as bisphosphonates
ibandronate a salt of ibandronic_acid is commercially available as roches once monthly bonivathe_r which was approved by the united states food and drug administration` fda' in 2005 for the treatment of osteoporosis
once monthly boniva *1328 the_r provides a 150 milligram` mg' dose of ibandronate

osteoporosis is a disease characterized by abnormal bone resorption
resorption the biological process by which bone is broken down causes decreased bone_strength and an increased risk of fractures
bisphosphonates are` potent inhibitors of bone resorption'
¡¬957_patent col._1,_ll._39-40
they inhibit abnormal bone destruction and enable the gradual restoration of lost bone_mineral_density` bmd'

bisphosphonates are generally known to have a low bioavailability when administered orally i.e. only a small fraction of a given dose is absorbed into the blood
additionally oral_administration of bisphosphonates can result in adverse esophageal and gastrointestinal side_effects
as a result of the side_effects and to improve the bioavailability of the drug patients taking bisphosphonates must adhere to a dosing_regimen that requires a bisphosphonate tablet to be taken in a fasting state at least 30 minutes before eating or drinking
in the past the inconvenience of that regimen created problems of patient_compliance
researchers in the field believed that less-frequent dosing would result in patients continuing the treatment for the long term which is required for bisphosphonate treatments to be successful

roche owns the ¡¬634_patent and the ¡¬957_patent which is the parent of the ¡¬634_patent
claims 1-8 of the ¡¬634_patent and claims 1-10 of the ¡¬ 957 patent are at issue in this case and describe a method of treating osteoporosis consisting of orally administering about 150 mg of ibandronic_acid once monthly on a single_day
claim 1 of the ¡¬634_patent is representative of the claims on appeal 1
a method for treating or inhibiting postmenopausal_osteoporosis in a postmenopausal_woman in need of treatment or inhibition of postmenopausal_osteoporosis by administration of a pharmaceutically acceptable_salt of ibandronic_acid comprising a commencing the administration of the pharmaceutically acceptable_salt of ibandronic_acid by orally administering to the postmenopausal_woman on a single_day a first dose in the form of a tablet wherein the tablet comprises an amount of the pharmaceutically acceptable_salt of ibandronic_acid that is equivalent to about 150 mg of ibandronic_acid ; and
( b continuing the administration by orally administering once monthly on a single_day a tablet comprising an amount of the pharmaceutically acceptable_salt of ibandronic_acid that is equivalent to about 150 mg of ibandronic_acid

ii
the defendants in this case are generic drug manufacturers who submitted abbreviated new drug applications` andas' to the fda for approval to engage in the manufacture and sale of generic versions of bonivathe_r prior to the expiration of roches patents
roche sued the defendants in the united_states_district_court for the district of new_jersey alleging infringement under 35 u.s.c.¡± 271 e 2 based on the defendants anda filings

roche moved for a preliminary_injunction
the district_court denied the motion holding that roche had failed to prove it was likely to succeed in defeating the defendants obviousness challenge
this court affirmed the district_courts denial of the preliminary_injunction
see hoffmann-la_roche_inc. v. apotex_inc. 496_fed.appx._46_(fed.cir.2012)

*1329 while the appeal of the preliminary_injunction decision was pending the district_court granted the defendants motion for summary_judgment of invalidity of claims 1-8 of the ¡¬634_patent due to obviousness under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a
as to the frequency of dosing the court found that once monthly_oral_dosing of ibandronate was established in the prior_art
as to the amount of the monthly_dose the court found that the combination of several_prior_art_references suggested a dosage_level of about 150 mg per month or at least indicated that a monthly_dose of 150 mg was obvious to try

the district_court considered roches evidence of objective considerations of nonobviousness but concluded that` roches objective considerations evidence does not rise to the level of a mere scintilla and it is not sufficient to defeat the motion for summary_judgment'
in response to roches argument that the 150 mg once monthly_dose gave results that were superior to a 2.5 mg_daily_dose the court found that roche had` pointed to no evidence in support of [ its ] claim that the skilled artisan would have been surprised that the 150 mg once-monthly_dose was superior to the 2.5 mg_daily_dose'
the court refused to consider contentions raised at oral argument that the 150 mg_dose had a superior and unexpected_level of bioavailability because roche had not raised that argument in its opposition brief

pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure 56 f the court then raised on its own motion the issue of summary_judgment of invalidity of claims 1-10 of the ¡¬957_patent
after considering the parties submissions the court held those claims invalid for the same_reasons that applied to the claims of the ¡¬ 634 patent
roche argued that it was unexpected that an intermittent_ibandronate_regimen would be effective in reducing fractures
but the court concluded that the evidence on which roche relied failed to show that a person of skill in the art would not have had a reasonable_expectation that the patented_method would succeed in reducing fractures
the court explained that` empirical confirmation that a method for increasing bone_mineral_density helps increase bone_strength enough that bones break less easily would not appear to be all that surprising'

in its motion for reconsideration roche argued that the district_court had improperly failed to consider evidence that the 150 mg_dose of ibandronate showed an unexpected_level of bioavailability as compared with lower_doses
on the merits of that argument the district_court found that the` evidence that the 150mg_dosage was absorbed better by the body simply has no relevance to the core finding that the difference between the 150mg_dose and the prior_art was small' and that there was a reasonable_expectation of success with the 150 mg_dose

roche timely appealed the grants of summary_judgment of obviousness

iii
the issue in this case is whether it would have been obvious at the time of invention to select a once monthly_oral_dosing_regimen of ibandronate to treat osteoporosis and to set that dose at 150 mg

a
monthly dosing
1
a relatively infrequent dosing schedule has long been viewed as a potential solution to the problem of patient_compliance stemming from the inconvenience of oral bisphosphonate regimens
fosamaxthe_r a prior_art bisphosphonate product sold by merck & co. was administered weekly and several_prior_art_references taught once monthly_oral_dosing of ibandronate or other_bisphosphonates

*1330 first an article in the trade journal lunar_news entitled update bisphosphonates` lunar_news' stated that` [ r ] esearchers are seeking solutions for better compliance' including approaches that` use bisphosphonates with high potency yet low irritability such as.. ibandronate roche
oral agents could be given intermittently once/month for example and still be quite potent'
second a 2001 article by carey_krause in chemical market reporter` krause' disclosed that roche would likely seek fda approval of an` oral once-monthly' formulation of ibandronate in 2003
finally united_states_patent_no._6468,559` chen' disclosed coated-dosage_forms of bisphosphonic_acids and methods for orally administering those dosage_forms
ibandronic acid was identified as one of many known bisphosphonic_acids
chen disclosed a preferred_embodiment in which` a dosage form of the invention is administered to a patient.. preferably once a month'
lunar_news krause and chen therefore specifically taught the monthly_administration of ibandronate

similarly the prior_art contained references to the monthly oral_administration of bisphosphonates in general
united states patent application no.2003/0118634` schofield' taught dosing of` bone-active phosponate [ s ]' and referred to equivalent doses that` can be given every other_day twice a week weekly biweekly or monthly'
united states patent no._5616,560` geddes' disclosed a bisphosphonate administration regimen in which` said bisphosphonate is administered at least 1 day of every said thirty 30 -day treatment period'

2
roche argues that the art taught away from once monthly_dosing because according to roche it was widely believed as of the date of invention that a bisphosphonate regimen with a dose-free_interval longer than one or two weeks would not be effective
to support that contention roche primarily relies on the alleged failure of its intravenous ibandronate study` recker' to demonstrate antifracture_efficacy with quarterly dosing
secondarily roche relies on a prior_art article by thomas schnitzer` schnitzer' speculating that the failure of the recker_study was due to the long dose-free_interval

the recker_study however showed a 26 %_reduction in vertebral fractures with intravenous ibandronate administered once every three months
the study was a` failure' only in the sense that the 26 %_reduction was statistically insignificant given the large number of patients that would have been required to reach a statistically significant conclusion about the relative rates of fractures in the control and subject groups
with respect to the reduction of hip_fractures for example recker concluded that` a meaningful conclusion with regard to efficacy could not be made owing to the low absolute number of hip_fractures'
reckers failure to generate statistically significant results points to a fault in the study ; it does not teach that infrequent ibandronate dosing is ineffective in treating osteoporosis

the prior_art references that interpreted reckers results demonstrate only that it was unknown why recker was unsuccessful in demonstrating statistically significant antifracture_efficacy
schnitzer speculated that the long drug-free_interval was to blame for the inconclusive results and that dosing intervals longer than one or two weeks would be ineffective
on the other hand an article by dr. dennis black` black' described speculation that the doses used in recker were too low
in fact roche itself subsequently acknowledged that the recker_study was underdosed
thus schnitzers speculation did not amount to an affirmative teaching *1331 away from monthly_oral_dosing of ibandronate especially in the face of blacks competing explanation of the recker results

any doubt about the efficacy of oral_ibandronate dosing that may have been created by schnitzers speculation was put to rest by an article published in 2001 by riis et_al
entitled ibandronate a comparison of oral_daily dosing versus_intermittent dosing in postmenopausal_osteoporosis` riis'
riis demonstrated that` intermittent ibandronate is as effective as the continuous treatment in terms of significantly increasing bmd at the spine and hip and suppressing markers of bone_turnover'
riis showed that increases in bmd equivalent to those obtained with a 2.5 mg per day treatment regimen were obtained with a regimen of 20 mg of ibandronate every other_day for the first 24 days of every three-month period
those results riis concluded` confirm [ ed ] preclinical data showing that it is the total_dose over a predefined period and not the dosing_regimens that is the determining factor for effect on bone_mass and architecture after ibandronate_treatment'
riiss teaching that a dose-free_interval of more than two months did not impact the bmd efficacy of ibandronate was directly contrary to schnitzers speculation that such a dosing_regimen would not be effective
therefore even if schnitzers interpretation of the recker_study were viewed as teaching away from monthly_dosing riiss contrary findings substantially undermined that interpretation

roche argues that riis did not overcome schnitzers interpretation because riis was not an antifracture trial
roche argues that prior_art focusing only on bmd and bone-turnover improvements instead of on antifracture_efficacy does not bear on the obviousness analysis in this case because such prior_art does not establish a reasonable_expectation of success in reducing fracture_risk

while it is true that bmd_improvements do not perfectly correlate with antifracture_efficacy it was well established in the art that bmd is a powerful surrogate for measuring fracture_risk
for example roches own expert explained bone mineral density is directly related to fracture_risk
it is one of the most powerful surrogate markers in the field of medicine
it is as powerful an indicator of osteoporosis as blood pressure is a predictor of stroke
for every standard deviation reduction in bone_mineral_density fracture_risk is doubled

roches patents do not themselves present data demonstrating antifracture_efficacy for a once monthly 150 mg_dose
in fact antifracture_efficacy for bonivathe_r was demonstrated to the fda through a` bridging study' that used bmd and bone_turnover results-not antifracture testing-to establish the therapeutic noninferiority of the 150 mg_monthly_dose relative to the previously approved 2.5 mg_daily_dose for which antifracture_efficacy had been demonstrated

conclusive proof of efficacy is not necessary to show obviousness
all that is required is a reasonable_expectation of success
see pharmastem therapeutics inc. v. viacell inc. 491_f.3d_1342 1363-64 fed.cir.2007 ; pfizer inc. v. apotex inc. 480_f.3d_1348 1364 fed.cir.2007
riis-along with other prior_art that used bmd_improvement as the primary efficacy marker for treating osteoporosis-established at least a reasonable_expectation that once monthly_dosing of ibandronate could successfully treat osteoporosis and reduce fracture_risk

b
selecting the 150 mg_dose
1
riis confirmed the total-dose_concept whereby` the efficacy of ibandronate *1332 depends on the total oral dose given rather than on the dosing schedule'
riis therefore teaches that in setting the dosage_level for an intermittent_ibandronate_regimen one need only scale up a known-effective_dose from a short-interval_regimen-e.g. daily dosing-to achieve approximately the same bmd and bone-loss efficacy with a long-interval_regimen

the prior_art provided substantial guidance as to the total_dose within a given time period that would produce effective results
a 1996 article by ravn_et_al
(` ravn' reported the results of a study that measured bmd_improvements and bone-turnover markers for daily ibandronate doses of 0.25 mg 0.5 mg 1.0 mg 2.5 mg and 5 mg
the authors concluded that the` average change in bone_mass showed positive_outcome in all regions in the groups receiving ibandronate 2.big_token__5_and_5__big_token0 mg.' the 2.5 mg_dose exhibited a response that was` virtually equal' to the 5 mg_dose even though it contained only half the amount of ibandronate
the 2.5 mg_dose was thereby deemed the` most effective_dose'

a person skilled in the art looking to scale to a monthly_dose of oral_ibandronate from a known-effective daily_dose was thus faced with a very limited set of possibilities of the five daily_doses tested in ravn only the 2.big_token__5_and_5__big_token mg_doses` showed positive_outcome in all regions'
even though the 5 mg_dose did not demonstrate greater efficacy than the 2.5 mg_dose it was still deemed an equivalently effective_dose so that someone scaling it to a single monthly_dose of 150 mg 5 mg/day x 30 days/month would have anticipated equivalent success in raising bmd and limiting bone_turnover based on riis

additionally united_states_patent_no._6432,932` daifotis' disclosed weekly doses of ibandronate` from the group consisting of 35 mg 40 mg 45 mg or 50 mg.' the 35 mg weekly dose corresponds to the same total_dose as a 5 mg_daily_dose
the total-dose equivalent to 5 mg of ibandronate per day is thus the only_dose that appears in both ravn and daifotis-suggesting that there was a reasonable_expectation of success with the total-dose_equivalents of the 5 mg_daily_dose i.e. 150 mg per month

accordingly the prior_art pointed to a monthly treatment of 150 mg of ibandronate
at the very least the 150 mg_dose was obvious to try there was a need to solve the problem of patient_compliance by looking to less-frequent dosing_regimens
and based on ravn and daifotis in light of riiss total-dose_concept there were only a` finite_number of identified predictable_solutions'
ksr_int l_co. v. teleflex 550_u.s._398 421 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007)

2
roche contends that findings by the fda taught away from further_development of the 5 mg_daily_dose and its total-dose_equivalents because the fda approved a 2.5 mg_daily_dose of ibandronate instead of a 5 mg_daily_dose
but the fda never made any findings contrary to the 5 mg_daily_dose because it was never asked to approve that dose
instead in approving the 2.5 mg_daily_dose the fda merely restated the results of ravn and concluded that` the 2.5 mg_daily_dose of ibandronate has the most favorable benefit-risk ratio and is the most appropriate dose for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal_osteoporosis'

roche next contends that schofield taught away from using anything other than the lowest_effective_dose of a bisphosphonate which according to roche was established by ravn to be 2.5 mg for ibandronate
schofield however does not teach that the lowest_effective_dose is the only_dose that should be used when treating osteoporosis with a bisphosphonate
*1333 instead schofield merely defined the lowest_effective_dose as a measure of a drugs potency relative to its therapeutic effects
schofield then described a preferred_embodiment of a method for treating bone disorders in which the maintenance_dose of a` bone-active phosphonate' ranged from 2.big_token__5_to_15__big_token mg per day
that range clearly encompasses more than just a lowest_effective_dose
moreover ravn never purported to establish a lowest_effective_dose
instead it sought to establish a` most effective [ daily ] dose'

roche argues that the district_court misinterpreted and misapplied the total-dose_concept from riis
according to roche the district_court` took a technical leap' in finding that riiss total-dose_concept implied only simple multiplication to scale from an efficacious daily_dose to a monthly_dose
the evidence before the district_court however showed that the total-dose_concept can be used as an effective rule of thumb by a person skilled in the art deciding how to scale to an efficacious intermittent dose of ibandronate
the riis study in particular established that the total_dose_concept can reliably predict that the efficacy of an ibandronate_treatment depends on the total_dose administered to a patient over a given period not on the amount administered at any single point in time
in light of that evidence it was reasonable to expect that a once monthly_dose of 150 mg would have roughly the same efficacy as a daily_dose of 5 mg

c. safety of the 150 mg_dose
roche next contends that there are disputed issues of fact as to whether it would have been obvious to administer once monthly_doses of 150 mg in light of alleged safety_concerns about the adverse gastrointestinal effects of ibandronate and other_bisphosphonates

first roche argues that ravn taught away from further_development of the 5 mg_daily_dose and thereby its total-dose_equivalents because ravn taught that the 2.5 mg_daily_dose was more effective than the 5 mg_daily_dose and had fewer side_effects
ravn however concluded that` the responses in the groups receiving 2.big_token__5_and_5__big_token mg ibandronate were virtually equal' not that the 2.5 mg_dose was more effective
and although patients on the 5 mg_daily_dose dropped out of the study at a higher rate than patients on lower_doses ravn did not conclude that the higher drop-out rate was statistically significant
instead the authors merely noted that a higher_frequency of diarrhea was experienced with the 5 mg_dose
a higher_frequency of diarrhea does not necessarily teach away from the 5 mg_daily_dose or its equivalents however as the prior_art indicated that modest gastrointestinal side_effects must be weighed in light of the benefits of the drug
indeed ravn itself concluded that` [ i ] n the present study the side effect profile of ibandronate seemed to be safe' and that` [ i ] n general the safety evaluation did not reveal any differences between ibandronate and placebo treated groups'

moreover even if the higher incidence of diarrhea and the larger number of dropouts in the ravn study were initially enough to teach away from further_development of the 5 mg_daily_dose and its total_dose_equivalents any such teaching away would have been overcome by riiss finding that an oral_administration of 20 mg of ibandronate every other_day for 24 days followed by a nine-week rest phase resulted in the same rate of side_effects as a 2.5 mg daily regimen

aside from ravn roche does not point to any references suggesting that there were safety_concerns associated with the 150 mg_dose
nor was roches expert dr. *1334 harris aware of anything that taught that a once monthly 150 mg_dose of ibandronate would be unsafe

to the contrary the prior_art establishes that doses even higher than 150 mg were considered safe
united_states_patent_no._6143,326` mockel' stated that rapid-release ibandronate formulations showed` no significant_side_effects.. in clinical_studies using ibandronate even at high_dosages' and disclosed single-dose units up to 250 mg
defendants expert dr. yates testified that the disclosures in mockel would have led a person of ordinary_skill in the art to understand that ibandronate doses up to 250 mg would be well tolerated
likewise daifotis disclosed that` [ f ] or human oral compositions comprising ibandronate.. a unit dosage typically comprises from about 3.5 mg to about 200 mg of the ibandronate compound'

there is thus no genuine issue of fact concerning whether the prior_art taught away from the 150 mg_dose based on safety_concerns

d. unexpected results
roche argues that the district_court erred by granting summary_judgment of obviousness because the evidence of record showed that the 150 mg_monthly_dose was more effective than the 2.5 mg_daily_dose and that the superior effectiveness of the 150 mg_monthly_dose was unexpected
roche also contends that ibandronates nonlinear_bioavailability at the 150 mg_dosage_level was an unexpected result

roches mobile_study published in 2005 demonstrated that a 150 mg_monthly_dose is more effective than a 2.5 mg_daily_dose with respect to bmd_improvement in the lumbar_spine and most hip sites
the mobile_study demonstrated for example a mean bmd_improvement in the lumbar_spine of 4.9 % after one year for patients taking the 150 mg_monthly_dose and 3.9 % after one year for patients taking the 2.5 mg_daily_dose
another study published in 2005 showed that the extent of ibandronates bioavailability is nonlinear with increasing dosages increasing the oral dose by 50 percent from 100 mg to 150 mg resulted in a nearly 150 percent increase in the amount of the drug absorbed by the blood

while the evidence would support a finding of superior_efficacy of the 150 mg_monthly_dose in raising bmd levels as compared to a 2.5 mg_daily_dose that improved efficacy does not rebut the strong showing that the prior_art disclosed monthly_dosing and that there was a reason to set that dose at 150 mg. see in re merck & co. 800_f.2d_1091 1099 fed.cir.1986
the evidence of superior_efficacy does nothing to undercut the showing that there was a reasonable_expectation of success with the 150 mg_monthly_dose even if the level of success may have turned out to be somewhat greater than would have been expected

for the same_reasons the nonlinear_bioavailability of ibandronate does not rebut the prima facie showing of obviousness of a once monthly_dose of 150 mg
the increased level of bioavailability has not been shown to be responsible for the improved osteoporosis treatment efficacy of the 150 mg_dose
a study by ravn_et_al
in 2002 showed for example that a near doubling of the blood-serum concentration of ibandronate with a 5 mg_daily_dose compared to a 2.5 mg_daily_dose produced no further bmd increase and no further reduction in bone_turnover
other record evidence confirms that` [ d ] ue to strong binding to the bone surface the effects of the systemically available amount of a bisphosphonate are almost exclusively related to its concentration in bone rather than [ blood ] serum level'
*1335 the evidence regarding bioavailability is therefore of little relevance to the obviousness inquiry

accordingly we uphold the judgment of the district_court that claims 1-8 of the ¡¬634_patent and claims 1-10 of the ¡¬957_patent would have been obvious in light of the prior_art and are therefore invalid

affirmed

newman circuit_judge dissenting
hoffmann-laroches once-a-month bonivathe_r ibandronate medication for osteoporosis required twelve years of research and clinical testing and evaluation to demonstrate its efficacy when dosed once a month and its safety at this high monthly_dosage
the prior investigations of intermittent_dosing and the publications describing protocols of lesser success missed the protocol that produced this successful_method
indeed this prior_art weighs heavily against obviousness for despite extensive exploration this successful protocol was not discovered

invalidation of this patent is not supported by clear and convincing_evidence
the courts ruling of obviousness violates the principles of graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966) all factors must be considered including commercial_success failure of others and long-felt need
the courts reasoning violates the guidance of ksr_int l_co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 421 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007) the standard of obvious-to-try requires a limited_number of specified alternatives offering a likelihood of success in light of the prior_art and common_sense this court instead invoking judicial hindsight to reconstruct the patented subject matter

nowhere amid the many studies of bisphosphonate osteoporosis treatments over a wide_range of dosages and conditions did any reference show or suggest the bonivathe_r combination of a single 150 mg_dose and once-a-month administration
no reference suggested the effectiveness and safety of this combination
nonetheless my colleagues declare this treatment obvious to them
my colleagues primary reason that 150 mg is thirty times the daily_dose of 5 mg does not mention that the fda refused to approve the 5 mg_dose due to its toxic side_effects
surely this leads away from the obviousness of a single dose thirty times larger

i respectfully dissent

discussion
the unexpected_results of the patented_method are conceded by the panel_majority
the evidence on summary_judgment was that many others sought and failed to find an efficacious intermittent treatment schedule
the prior_art relied on by my colleagues surrounded but missed the roche_method
the prior_art shows that safety is likely to be compromised at high doses and that efficacy is likely to be compromised at extended dosing intervals
nonetheless this court now holds that it was obvious to do what no one did or even suggested ; my colleagues simply disregard the preferences and toxicity warnings and discard the procedures of the prior_art

the prior_art shows intermittent therapies ranging from every other_day to once a week to twice a week to twice a month to every three months plus varying initial loading periods in a wide_range of dosages
the prior_art is replete with warnings of toxicity and patient noncompliance
the panel_majority acknowledges that roches mobile_study and the nonlinear_bioavailability data discussed infra demonstrate that the 150 mg monthly treatment produced unexpected_results but deems this irrelevant ; the court now with *1336 knowledge of roches success deems roches successful_method to have been obvious all along

the supreme court recognized in ksr that a patent challenger must` identify a reason that would have prompted a person of ordinary_skill in the relevant field' to arrive at the patented invention
550 u.s. at 418 127_s.ct._1727
my colleagues unable to find any suggestion of the roche_protocol in the prior_art accept the argument that a monthly single dose of 150 mg was obvious because a monthly_dose of 150 mg is thirty times a daily_dose of 5 mg
the fda had refused to approve a daily_dose of 5 mg due to its demonstrated heightened toxicity
the success of a dose thirty times larger than the prohibited 5 mg_dose can not reasonably be predicted
neither the prior_art nor common_sense provides the expectation that a once-a-month treatment at a dosage of 150 mg would be safe and effective

a
the prior art
1
the mockel patent
my colleagues combine many references to support their ruling of obviousness
they cite the mockel patent1 for the proposition that single doses of more than 150 mg were` known'
mockel is directed to coated tablet formulations not the concentration of active ingredients
mockel provides specific examples of ibandronate tablets containing a maximum dose of 50 mg states that the preferred upper_limit is 100 mg and that the formulations could contain up to about 250 mg. mockel shows no formulated dose larger than 50 mg although the reference contains the usual expansive statements of the patent scrivener

mockel states that` no significant_side_effects were observed in clinical_studies using ibandronate at high_dosages' but does not state that` high' exceeds his preferred upper_limit for at that time the fda had determined that` [ a ] single oral dose of 100 mg is the maximum tolerable dose of ibandronate'
j.a
8558
yet my colleagues rely on this reference as rendering obvious roches specific once-a-month dosage of 150 mg

2
lunar_news
other references also show that the field was seeking a better bisphosphonate protocol and that the problems were not solved
the lunar_news article,2 on which the panel_majority places heavy reliance broadly states that some osteoporosis agents can be given intermittently
however it never directly associates ibandronate with oral therapy
instead the lunar_news article states the then-current wisdom that` [ t ] he projected mode for ibandronate is injection once every three months'
j.a
24321
contrary to the panel_majority this article supports unobviousness of the roche therapy not obviousness

3
the chen patent
the chen patent3 is similarly inapt
chen sought to minimize the adverse effects associated with bisphosphonic_acids by combining the bisphosphonic acid with a carrier that acts as a dispersing medium for the active agent
chen lists all of the known bisphosphonic_acids and states that oral dosages may be administered anywhere *1337 between once every two weeks and once every twelve weeks with the optimal frequency of once every twelve weeks
chen does not provide any example using ibandronate and does not suggest a specific dosage or dosage interval for any ibandronate-containing product
nor does chen state what parameters may lead to a successful regimen

4
the geddes patent
the other references on which my colleagues rely are no more helpful to their conclusion
the geddes patent4 is directed to a combination therapy of a bisphosphonate compound and a hormone and states that the bisphosphonate may be dosed from every day to once a month
geddes does not mention ibandronate or the dosage or suggest that it may be effective at 150 mg once a month

5
the schofield patent application
the schofield application,5 on which the court also relies describes a treatment regimen featuring a front-end` loading period' of 7_to_180 days followed by a maintenance_dose
the loading_dose of bisphosphonate may be given daily or every other_day while the maintenance_dose may be given anywhere from daily to monthly
schofield further states that the loading_dose is about two to twenty times greater than the maintenance_dose
schofield mentions ibandronate as a possible active agent appropriate for use in its methods but provides no dosages or specified periods for ibandronate

6
the riis article
several references address intermittent treatment but none suggests once-monthly_administration of 150 mg of oral_ibandronate
the court relies on the riis article,6 which shows dosing patients with 20 mg of ibandronate every other_day for twenty-four days followed by a 9-week period of no treatment then returning to 20 mg every other_day for twenty-four days and a 9-week period of no treatment etc
the court characterizes this as definitive proof of the` total dosing concept'
however riis makes no suggestion that the once-a-month dosing at the high dosage used by roche could replace riis elaborate procedure

riis illustrates the general belief that some sort of complex dosing is needed if daily_doses are supplanted
the simplicity of the bonivathe_r regimen is nowhere to be found although the need for a better regimen was well recognized
see graham 383 u.s. at 18 86_s.ct._684 objective evidence of nonobviousness includes long-felt need and failure of others
riis contains no suggestion that a once-monthly_dosage of 150 mg would be both safe and effective-this became known only after roche discovered it

7
the recker study
by comparison the recker article,7 which sets forth in its introduction the state of the art in 2004 states that` oral bisphosphonates must be administered frequently e.g. daily or weekly' and in accordance with` stringent dosing recommendations'

*1338 only this court reads the prior_art to suggest and render obvious that which eluded the art at the time

8
the ravn study
the court attempts to overcome the shortcomings of the prior_art by applying the total_dose_concept of riis to the dosage ranges in the ravn8 reference
ravn tested daily treatment using a range of dosages and concluded that 2.5 mg per day is the most effective_dose
yet the court selects ravns 5.0 mg_dose despite its increased toxicity and ravns preference for the lower dose to scale up to roches 150 mg_dose
ravn does not suggest a once-monthly_dose of 150 mg

it is also noteworthy that the riis publication which is later in time than ravn selected the 2.5 mg_dosage not the 5.0 mg_dosage as a framework for intermittent_dosing

9
the daifotis patent
the panel_majority also cites a patent issued to roches expert dr._daifotis9 as evidence of obviousness of monthly_oral_dosing
dr._daifotis described dosing schedules ranging from twice a week to twice a month and recommended once-a-week dosing of 7 mg to 100 mg with a preferred range of 35 mg to 50 mg per week
daifotis does not show or suggest any monthly_dosage or that monthly_dosing might be effective
nonetheless the panel_majority selects the daifotis 35 mg per week dosage calculates that 35 mg times 4 weeks is about 150 mg per month and combines this calculation with riis and ravn to find obvious the roche combination of dosage and schedule

b
the bioavailability explanation
my colleagues agree that the results achieved with the bonivathe_r_product were not suggested or predicted
in her expert report dr._daifotis discussed the scientific basis that had later been found to explain the successful_treatment obtained with this protocol
dr._daifotis presented a published scientific article by reginster10 et_al
showing the disproportionate uptake of ibandronate into the blood stream an unpredicted and unusual result
dr._daifotis testified that this explains the unexpected efficacy of roches 150 mg_dose
the record contains the following graphical portrayal where the mean area under the curve auc indicates the average concentration of ibandronate in the blood

?
*1339 dr._daifotis explained that` [ t ] his was a surprising finding concerning the disproportionate amount of ibandronate that becomes available from oral_administration of amounts above about 50 mg and it was unknown as of may 2002'
j.a
20726-27 ?
108
dr._daifotis explained that` [ t ] he benefit of this surprising result was that a patient could receive higher than thought possible amounts of active drug to be available to inhibit osteoclasts while at the time not adversely affecting the safety profile of a 150 mg_dose of ibandronate'
j.a
20732 ?
115
dr._daifotis also cited clinical trial data showing that a 150 mg_monthly_dose of ibandronate is superior at increasing bone density in the lumbar_spine of postmenopausal women as compared to 100 mg given once a month 50 mg given on two consecutive days in a single month 50/50 and a 2.5 mg_daily_dose

the record contains other scientific articles e.g. paul d. miller et_al. monthly oral ibandronate therapy in postmenopausal_osteoporosis 1-year from the mobile study 20 j
bone miner
res.. 1315-22 2005
nothing in the prior_art renders the result expected predicted or obvious

c. expert testimony
also of record were the reports of roches experts dr. bilezikian and dr. harris
roche explained that each opines that at the time of the inventions a person skilled in the art would not have had any reasonable_expectation of succeeding with a safe effective and well-tolerated once-monthly oral dosage of ibandronate in an amount as large as 150 mg

the trier of fact is` requir [ ed to ] consider all evidence relating to obviousness before finding a patent invalid on those grounds'
in re cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsule patent litig. 676_f.3d_1063 1075 fed.cir.2012
it is noteworthy that although the generic producers who are defendants herein also presented expert reports no expert provided anything other than a personal opinion that the roche discovery was obvious

*1340 the evidence of long-felt need failure of others and commercial_success was unrebutted and no adverse expert provided any evidence from which the success of the bonivathe_r_product could be confidently predicted
their only argument was that it would have been` obvious to try' the roche_method
of course it is possible to speculate about all sorts of treatment schedules as in the krause newsletter,11 but speculation without specificity and a plan for achieving a reasonable likelihood of success does not provide clear and convincing_evidence of obviousness on the ground of` obvious to try'

d. obvious to try
for an invention to be obvious to try there must be a finite_number of known choices in the prior_art and a reasonable_expectation of success for the choice that is tried
ksr 550 u.s. at 421 127_s.ct._1727
obvious to try can not be found when the prior_art gives no hint that a specific trial might achieve the desired result
in re kubin 561_f.3d_1351 1359 fed.cir.2009 quoting in re o'farrell 853_f.2d_894 903 fed.cir.1988
dr._daifotis testified` monthly_oral_dosing of alendronate was not seen as a feasible or desirable endeavor for investigation ; if it had been we would have explored it'
j.a
20717

the law of` obvious to try' requires that there be a limited_number of defined alternatives and a suggestion that the desired result is likely to be achieved through the proposed trial
the court stated when there is a design need or market pressure to solve a problem and there are a finite_number of identified predictable_solutions a person of ordinary_skill has good reason to pursue the known options within his or her technical grasp
if this leads to the anticipated success it is likely the product not of innovation but of ordinary_skill and common_sense

ksr 550 u.s. at 421 127_s.ct._1727
here however even my colleagues agree that the result was unpredicted and that there was no suggestion in the prior_art or in common_sense that this procedure might produce the sought-after result
nonetheless my colleagues invalidate the successful_treatment as` obvious to try'

the extensive experimentation with other regimens and dosages demonstrates that this selection was not obvious to try
the failure to meet this long-felt need weighs heavily against my colleagues finding that the roche_protocol although not obvious to investigators in the field is obvious to this court
as stated in in re soni 54_f.3d_746 750 fed.cir.1995` [ t ] he basic principle behind this rule is straightforward-that which would have been surprising to a person of ordinary_skill in the particular art would not have been obvious'
as established in ksr absent limited alternatives and some direction toward the successful path` obvious to try' is not applicable

the prior_art does not suggest the roche_protocol or that it might have a reasonable_expectation of success
only with knowledge of roches success can one reconstruct that which is not suggested in the prior_art
if anything the large amount of study and publication adds to the uncertainty for it provides no direction for potential success
the courts holding today will simply discourage improvements in crowded fields by holding that even if such investigation should succeed a patent is not available

*1341 from my colleagues invalidation of the patent on this significant medical advance i respectfully dissent
