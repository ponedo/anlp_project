*770 per curiam
international visual corporation ivc appeals from the march_9,_1992 judgment of the united_states_district_court for the northern_district of illinois granting summary_judgment of noninfringement in favor of crown metal manufacturing
international_visual_corp. v. crown_metal_mfg co. 22_uspq2d_1778 1992_wl_38376_(n.d.ill.1992)
because we determine that the district_court incorrectly interpreted the claims of ivcs u.s. patent 4,677,780 we reverse and remand

background
the780_patent is entitled` magnetically secured display apparatus'
on august 10 1989 ivc filed a complaint alleging that crowns gripper device infringed claims 1-big_token__3_and_6__big_token -10 of the patent
crown counterclaimed for a declaratory_judgment of noninfringement invalidity and unenforceability
ivc then moved for summary_judgment on the issues of infringement willful infringement and crowns invalidity defense and crown moved for summary_judgment of invalidity and unenforceability but did not move for summary_judgment of noninfringement
the district_court denied ivcs motion granted crowns motion on the ground of noninfringement and dismissed the case in its entirety

discussion
the issue before us is whether the district_court properly granted summary_judgment of noninfringement
we review the district_courts grant of summary_judgment de novo see national cable television ass n v. american cinema editors inc. 937_f.2d_1572 1576 19_uspq2d_1424 1427 fed.cir.1991 and specifically determine whether the courts claim_interpretation was legally correct
palumbo v. don-joy co. 762_f.2d_969 974 226_uspq_5 8 fed.cir.1985

at the outset we reject ivcs argument that the district_court was precluded from granting summary_judgment of noninfringement on the ground that crown did not specifically move for summary_judgment on that issue
`` [ d ] istrict courts are widely acknowledged to possess the power to enter summary_judgments sua sponte so long as the losing party was on notice that she had to come forward with all of her evidence'
celotex corp. v. catrett 477_u.s._317 326 106_s.ct._2548 2554 91_l.ed.2d_265_(1986)
in the instant case the record clearly shows that ivc had notice that the issue of noninfringement was before the court on the parties cross-motions for summary_judgment
ivc in fact stated that` the infringement issue is now ripe for summary adjudication' and argued the issue of infringement both literal and under the doctrine of equivalents on several occasions
thus summary_judgment of noninfringement for crown was not precluded merely because crown did not move for summary_judgment on that ground

literal infringement
the court held that the gripper did not infringe independent_claims 1_and_101 either literally or under the doctrine of *771 equivalents.2 as to literal_infringement the court held that the gripper did not meet the` housing_limitation' and` [ a ] ccordingly.. [ did ] not literally infringe independent_claims 1_and_10 of the780_patent as a matter of law'
22 uspq2d at 1780
consequently the court held that there was no literal_infringement of dependent claims 2 3 and 6-9

the court described the gripper as follows the defendants gripper clamp consists of a permanent_bar_magnet secured into a u-shaped ferromagnetic` channel member' which has been bent into an l-shape
there is no separate_housing since the u-shaped channel functions as a receptacle for the bar magnets and as a pole piece to significantly increase the magnetic strength of the flat bar magnets
id.at 1779 emphasis added
the court concluded the gripper undisputedly does not have a housing separate and apart from the components of the operational magnet i.e. the permanent_bar_magnet and the pole pieces
this housing_limitation set forth in the780_patent is not found exactly in the accused gripper
id.at 1780 emphasis added

ivc argues that the district_courts interpretation of the` housing' limitation was erroneous
it asserts that the court erroneously interpreted claim 1 to require that it be` separate and apart' from the permanent_magnet_means
we agree
claim 1 requires a clamp means that includes an l-shaped tubular_housing and a permanent_magnet_means integrally connected to the first_leg_portion of the housing
there is no` separate and apart' limitation in the claims ; that phrase appears nowhere in the780_patent
the term` integrally connected' in claim 1 is inconsistent with a requirement that the housing and permanent magnet be` separate and apart'
crown in fact conceded at oral_argument that the gripper channel member is a` housing' within the meaning of the claim

the implication of the courts conclusion that there also is no infringement of claim 10 is that the court considered that claim 10 requires a housing
claim 10 however unlike claim 1 does not require a` housing' but includes a` clamp_portion being generally l-shaped and having a tubular_horizontal_leg.. and a tubular_vertical_leg'
moreover the requirement that the magnet means be in the tubular_vertical_leg of the clamp is inconsistent with the courts requirement of separateness between the magnet and a housing

we also agree with ivc that the court incorrectly construed the claims to require a plastic_housing
the specification of the780_patent describes a plastic_housing only as a preferred embodiment of the invention ; crown conceded at oral_argument that the claims are not so limited
in concluding that the claims are limited to a plastic_housing the court apparently focused *772 on the hugger ivcs commercial_embodiment of the780_patent which has a plastic_housing
this was erroneous since` [ i ] nfringement is determined on the basis of the claims not on the basis of a comparison with the patentees commercial_embodiment of the claimed invention'
acs hosp sys. inc. v. montefiore hosp. 732_f.2d_1572 1578 221_uspq_929 933 fed.cir.1984
thus because of erroneous claim construction the courts conclusions on literal_infringement must be reconsidered

doctrine of equivalents
the court also examined the question of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents and concluded that the gripper performed substantially the same_function in substantially the same_way to obtain substantially the same_result as thebig_token__780_invention._22__big_token uspq2d at 1781
it nevertheless held that there was no infringement under the doctrine of equivalents because the range of equivalents sought by ivc` would have been obvious' in view of a french patent to delenne
id.at 1782
in so holding the court employed the` hypothetical_claim' approach of wilson sporting goods co. v. david geoffrey & assoc. 904_f.2d_677 14_uspq2d_1942_(fed.cir.) cert
denied 498_u.s._992 111_s.ct._537 112_l.ed.2d_547_(1990)

hypothetical claim analysis is an optional way of evaluating whether prior_art limits the application of the doctrine of equivalents
it is simply a way of expressing the well-established principle` that a patentee should not be able to obtain under the doctrine of equivalents coverage which he could not lawfully have obtained from the pto by literal claims'
id.at 684 14 uspq2d at 1948
if utilized this approach requires a court to visualize a hypothetical_claim that enlarges the scope of an issued claim so that it literally covers an accused device and to determine whether that hypothetical_claim would have been patentable over the prior_art
id.at 684-85 14 uspq2d at 1948-49 ; jurgens v. mckasy 927_f.2d_1552 1561 18_uspq2d_1031 1038 fed.cir
) cert
denied 502_u.s._902 112_s.ct._281 116_l.ed.2d_232_(1991)

the trial_court here utilized a hypothetical_claim in its analysis stating theangular clamping mechanism of the delenne224 is like the hypothetical_claim a two-legged l-shaped magnetic assembly without a separate_housing which attaches to asquare section of a rod
22 uspq2d at 1782 emphasis added
however because the court based its conclusion that the gripper literally escaped the780 claims only by lacking a housing` separate and apart' from the permanent_magnet_means a distinction that we now hold to be based upon an erroneous claim_interpretation it is not clear that a suitable hypothetical_claim that covers the gripper would necessarily have been obvious over delenne
thus remand is appropriate based on our claim_interpretation
on the other_hand on remand the court may decide that in light of its new analysis of literal_infringement if it concludes there is infringement application of the doctrine of equivalents is not necessary

conclusion
we reverse the courts grant of summary_judgment of noninfringement and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion

each party shall bear its own costs

reversed and remanded

*773 appendix
?
lourie circuit_judge concurring
i fully join the panel opinion
however i would have gone further than the opinion in instructing the district_court concerning application of the doctrine of equivalents on remand
i therefore wish to express some separate views concerning the much-troubled doctrine of equivalents

the supreme_court in graver_tank & mfg co. v. linde air prods co. 339_u.s._605 70_s.ct._854 94_l.ed._1097_(1950) provided todays framework for evaluating the doctrine in 1950 when it stated that it is designed to avoid` a fraud on a patent' by discouraging` the unscrupulous copyist [ from ] mak [ ing ] unimportant and insubstantial_changes and substitutions in the patent which though adding nothing *774 would be enough to take the copied matter outside the claim and hence outside the reach of law'
id.at 607-08 70 s.ct.at 855-56
the court noted that the doctrine is necessary to avoid` plac [ ing ] the inventor at the mercy of verbalism and.. subordinating substance to form'
id.at 607 70 s.ct.at 855
the court also focussed on what are often referred to as the` tripartite' tests stating that an accused device is an equivalent`if it performs substantially the same_function in substantially the same_way to obtain the same_result
`` id.at 608 70 s.ct.at 856 quoting sanitary refrigerator co. v. winters 280_u.s._30 42 50_s.ct._9 13 74_l.ed._147_(1929)

in recent years we have emphasized that the doctrine is equitable in nature
see pennwalt corp. v. durand-wayland inc. 833_f.2d_931 935 4_uspq2d_1737 1739 fed.cir.1987 in banc ; loctite corp. v. ultraseal ltd. 781_f.2d_861 870 228_uspq_90 96 fed.cir.1985 ; hughes aircraft co. v. united states 717_f.2d_1351 1361 219_uspq_473 480 fed.cir.1983
unfortunately however the tripartite test has become a mechanical formula which can often be applied to accused infringers who are not unscrupulous copyists and who have made more than insubstantial_changes under circumstances in which it may not be equitable to do so

the doctrine of equivalents is a sound one important for the proper protection of patentable inventions
however the doctrine has its limits and i believe that a court must ensure that it achieves its intended_purpose and does not simply become an automatic means for expanding the scope of a claim beyond that granted by examination in the patent and trademark_office
we have in fact noted that` the doctrine of equivalents is the exception.. not the rule for if the public comes to believe or fear that the language of patent claims can never be relied on and the doctrine of equivalents is simply the second prong of every infringement charge regularly available to extend protection beyond the scope of the claims then claims will cease to serve their intended_purpose'
london v. carson pirie scott & co. 946_f.2d_1534 1538 20_uspq2d_1456 1458-59 fed.cir.1991
see also charles greiner & co. v. mari-med mfg inc. 962_f.2d_1031 1036 22_uspq2d_1526 1529 fed.cir.1992

it is important that the public be able to rely on the claims of a patent in conjunction with the specification and file history as indicating` the metes and bounds of the claimed invention'
london 946 f.2d at 1538 20 uspq2d at 1458
because the doctrine of equivalents runs counter to the role of claims as the sole measure of the invention the claims may no longer adequately inform the public of the scope of protection and uncertainty and unjustified litigation can result
the solution may be to go beyond the tripartite_tests

the supreme_court did not make clear in graver_tank whether the tripartite_tests themselves constitute the application of equity or whether there is an equitable duty upon a court beyond the application of the tripartite_tests
this court has not done so either
however nothing in graver_tank states that mere satisfaction of the tripartite_tests itself establishes infringement by equivalence
in fact the court stated that` [ e ] quivalence.. is not the prisoner of a formula and is not an absolute to be considered in a vacuum'
339 u.s. at 609 70 s.ct.at 856
the court specifically distinguished non-infringing parties from infringing copyists by stating that` [ w ] ithout some explanation or indication that [ the accused product ] was developed by independent_research the trial_court could properly infer that the accused flux is the result of imitation rather than experimentation or invention'
id.at 612 70 s.ct.at 858
thus the court took account of the fact that there may be instances in which the function-way-result_tests may be satisfied but the facts may not justify the application of the doctrine of equivalents
this might occur if independent_research resulted in an invention or product significantly different from what is claimed albeit one that might perform substantially the same_function in the same_way to obtain the same_result

*775 the tripartite_tests often examine only what a device does rather than what it is
claims to machines articles of manufacture and compositions of matter generally define inventions by what they are i.e. structurally
thus products may meet the tripartite_tests in terms of what they do but be significantly different in terms of what they are
processes are defined by their steps so they may also be different in terms of what they are even if they are the same in what they do

thus the supreme_court may be considered to have articulated requirements beyond the tripartite_tests to enable one to determine whether an accused device which does not literally infringe the claims of a patent infringes under the doctrine of equivalents
prosecution history estoppel and avoidance of the prior_art are of course well-established aspects of the factual evaluation of infringement under the doctrine but the placing of an accused device on the copying-independent development spectrum should also be a critical inquiry in evaluating doctrine of equivalents questions
so should the degree of similarity of an accused invention to what is literally claimed ; the closer the similarity or the more` insubstantial' the change from what is literally claimed the greater the argument for equivalence independent of the tripartite_tests

moreover recognizing the equitable basis for the doctrine there may be other factors that a court should consider beyond the tripartite function-way-result_tests
whether a patent claims a pioneering invention may be a factor favoring the application of the doctrine
on the other_hand an attempt at extension of coverage by means of the doctrine of equivalents to include disclosed but unclaimed subject_matter may not be deserving of equitable consideration because it essentially permits a patentee to avoid examination by the patent and trademark_office
a patent applicant should not be able to present a broad disclosure in the specification of his or her patent file narrow claims and after allowance and grant of those narrow claims seek to extend protection by the doctrine of equivalents to the disclosed but unexamined subject_matter
* the district_court is in the best position to determine whether there are any equities that argue for or against its application

if there is no prosecution history estoppel if application of the doctrine would not encompass the prior_art and if the tripartite_tests are met i believe that a court should make a separate equitable determination specifically including the above-noted` spectrum' and` similarity' evaluations in order to find infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
ultimately a court needs to balance the publics need for certainty with the need for fairness to the patentee
the above-outlined criteria ought to enhance the accuracy of this judgment
