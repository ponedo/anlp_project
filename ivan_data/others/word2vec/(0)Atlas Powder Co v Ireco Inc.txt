opinion
rader circuit_judge
the united_states_district_court for the district of wyoming determined that u.s. patent no._4111,727 the clay_patent and its reissue u.s. patent no
re 33,788 the reissue_patent were invalid
atlas powder company atlas a licensee under those patents sued ireco_incorporated ireco for infringement of the clay_patent
following two bench trials the district_court concluded that both the original clay_patent and the reissue_patent were invalid as anticipated by either u.s. patent no._3161,551 egly or u.k. patent no._1306,546 butterworth
because the district_court correctly interpreted the claims and applied the law of anticipation this court affirms the finding of invalidity

the clay_patent and its reissue both claim explosive_compositions
to detonate *1344 explosives require both fuel and oxidizers
the oxidizer rapidly reacts with the fuel to produce expanding gases and heat - an explosion
composite explosives mix various sources of fuel and oxygen
the most widely used and economical composite explosive is ammonium_nitrate and fuel_oil anfo
anfo_explosives mix about 94 % by weight of ammonium_nitrate an the oxidizer with 6 % by weight of fuel_oil fo
the an may include porous_prills dense prills stengel flakes or crystalline an
anfo_explosives have two primary disadvantages
first wet conditions dissolve the an and make the explosive unusable in damp settings
second anfo is a relatively weak explosive because interstitial_air occupies considerable space in the mixture thereby decreasing the amount of explosive_material per unit of volume

to address these shortcomings explosive experts developed water-in-oil_emulsions
these emulsions dissolved the oxidizer into water and then dispersed the solution in oil
because oil surrounds the oxidizer it is resistant to moisture thus solving one of the problems with anfo
emulsions also increased the explosives bulk strength by increasing the density of explosive_material in the mixture
emulsions however also have a disadvantage
emulsions will not detonate unless sensitized
sensitivity of a blasting composition refers to the ease of igniting its explosion
experts generally sensitize emulsions by using gassing agents or adding microballoons throughout the mixture
the gassing agents or microballoons provide tiny_gas or air_bubbles throughout the mixture
upon detonation the gas pockets compress and heat up thereby igniting the fuel around them
in other_words the tiny_gas or air_bubbles act as` hot spots' to propagate the explosion

the clay_patent and its reissue both claim composite explosives made from the combination of an anfo blasting composition and an unsensitized water-in-oil_emulsion
both patents claim essentially the same blasting composition
claim one of the reissue_patent recites 1
a blasting composition consisting essentially of 10_to_40 % by weight of a greasy water-in-oil_emulsion and 60_to_90 % of a substantially undissolved particulate solid oxidizer salt constituent wherein the emulsion comprises about 3_to_15 % by weight of water about 2_to_15 % of oil 70_to_90 % of powerful oxidizer salt comprising ammonium_nitrate which may include other powerful oxidizer salts wherein the solid_constituent comprises ammonium_nitrate and in which sufficient_aeration is entrapped to enhance sensitivity to a substantial_degree and wherein the emulsion component is emulsified by inclusion of 0.big_token__1_to_5__big_token % by weight based on the total composition of an [ oil-in-water ] water-in-oil emulsifier to hold the aqueous content in the disperse or internal phase

when this lawsuit began atlas was the exclusive licensee under the clay_patent in the continental u.s. and hawaii
atlas commenced this lawsuit against ireco in 1986 alleging infringement of the clay_patent
during the course of litigation dr. robert clay the inventor filed a reissue petition with the united states patent and trademark office pto
atlas then moved to stay the litigation pending resolution of the reissue_application
the district_court denied that motion and conducted a first bench trial on the issues of validity and infringement of the clay_patent in october 1986
dr._clay then requested suspension of prosecution of the reissue_application by the pto in february 1987
after waiting several years for a decision from the district_court dr._clay requested that the pto reinstate the reissue proceedings in 1990
in january 1992 the clay_reissue_patent issued upon surrender of the original patent
later that *1345 year the district_court rendered its findings and judgment regarding the validity and infringement of the clay_patent

in its 1992 judgment the district_court found claims 1 2 3 10 12 13 and 14 of the clay_patent invalid as anticipated by either one of two prior_art_references egly or butterworth
egly and butterworth each disclose blasting compositions containing a water-in-oil_emulsion and anfo with ingredients identical to those of the clay_patents in overlapping amounts

the only_element of the clay_patent_claims which is arguably not present in the prior_art_compositions is` sufficient_aeration.. entrapped to enhance sensitivity to a substantial_degree'
the trial_court determined that` sufficient_aeration' was an inherent element in the prior_art blasting compositions within the overlapping ranges
the district_court also found that none of the accused products infringed any of the asserted claims
the 1992 judgment was not final however and specifically reserved a decision on the effect of the reissue_patent for phase two of the case

on september 22 1993 the district_court granted hanex_products inc.s hanex motion to intervene in the lawsuit
hanex owns the two patents and had licensed them to atlas
hanex asserted the same claim of patent infringement against ireco that atlas had asserted but also initiated a declaratory judgment action against ici_explosives_usa inc. ici atlas successor-in-interest seeking the sole_right to control the litigation
in july 1994 the district_court granted declaratory relief in favor of hanex against ici giving hanex the sole_right to control and direct the litigation on the two patents

after the reissue_patent issued the district_court conducted a second bench trial in january 1996 on the issues of phase two
specifically the district_court considered whether reissue affected its 1992 judgment
on september 25 1998 the district_court rendered its final judgment finding claims 1 2 3 10 12 13 and 14 of the clay_reissue_patent invalid as anticipated and finding that ireco had not infringed any of the asserted claims
despite the ptos consideration of the egly and butterworth references during prosecution of the reissue the district_court concluded that ireco had overcome the clay_reissue_patents presumption of validity under 35 u.s.c.¡± 282 1994 by clear and convincing_evidence
the district_court noted that ireco presented a great deal of testimonial and documentary evidence on inherent disclosures of the prior_art that was not before the pto in the *1346 reissue proceeding
hanex appealed to this court from the 1998 final judgment

ii
this court reviews claim construction as a matter of law
see cybor corp. v. fas techs. inc. 138_f.3d_1448 1451 46_uspq2d_1169 1173 fed.cir.1998 en banc ; markman v. westview instruments inc. 52_f.3d_967 979 34_uspq2d_1321 1326 fed.cir.1995 en banc
anticipation is a question of fact including whether or not an element is inherent in the prior_art
see in re schreiber 128_f.3d_1473 1477 44_uspq2d_1429 1431 fed.cir.1997
therefore this court reviews a finding of anticipation under the clearly erroneous standard
see gechter v. davidson 116_f.3d_1454 1457 43_uspq2d_1030 1032 fed.cir.1997

`` to anticipate a claim a prior_art_reference must disclose every limitation of the claimed invention either explicitly or inherently'
in re schreiber 128 f.3d at 1477
anticipation of a patent claim requires a finding that the claim at issue` reads on' a prior_art_reference
see titanium_metals corp. v. banner 778_f.2d_775 781 227_uspq_773 778 fed.cir.1985
in other_words if granting patent protection on the disputed claim would allow the patentee to exclude the public from practicing the prior_art then that claim is anticipated regardless of whether it also covers subject matter not in the prior_art
see id.at 781
specifically when a patent claims a chemical composition in terms of ranges of elements any single prior_art_reference that falls within each of the ranges anticipates the claim
see id.at 780-82` it is also an elementary principle of patent law that when as by a recitation of ranges or otherwise a claim covers several compositions the claim isanticipated if one of them is in the prior_art`
in chemical compounds a single prior_art species within the patents claimed genus reads on the generic claim and anticipates
see in re gosteli 872_f.2d_1008 1010 10_uspq2d_1614 1616 fed.cir.1989

as noted previously both egly and butterworth disclose blasting compositions with ingredients identical to those of the clay_patent and its reissue in overlapping amounts
the only_element which is arguably missing from the prior_art is the requirement that` sufficient_aeration [ be ] entrapped to enhance sensitivity to a substantial_degree'
to decide the issue of anticipation therefore the district_court examined whether` sufficient_aeration.. to enhance sensitivity' was inherently part of the prior_art_compositions
that decision in turn required the trial_court to interpret the claim_term` sufficient_aeration'
by looking at the express language of the claims and the patents written description the district_court concluded that the claim_term` sufficient_aeration' included both interstitial_air between oxidizer_particles and porous_air within the pores of oxidizer_particles

the first task of this court on appeal is to construe independently the disputed claim_term
this question requires this court to determine whether the claim_term` sufficient_aeration' includes porous_air as the trial_court determined
the claim_term` sufficient_aeration' does not limit the air content of the composition to interstitial_air
rather the broad term` aeration' contains no qualitative_limits on the kind of air_exposure only the quantitative limit that the air_exposure be` sufficient' to enhance sensitivity
if the inventor intended` sufficient_aeration' to carry qualitative_limits he also did not express that intention in the patents written description
the specification gives no explicit definition of the phrase` sufficient_aeration.. to enhance sensitivity' which appears in the patent for the first time in the claims

*1347 it is of course possible that the inventor did not include qualitative_limits on the term` sufficient_aeration' in the specification because those of ordinary_skill in the art understand that only interstitial_air enhances sensitivity and satisfies the claims language
see autogiro co. of am
v. u.s. 181_ct.cl._55 384_f.2d_391 397 155_uspq_697_(ct.cl.1967)` claims can not be clear and unambiguous on their face
`` ; markman 52 f.3d at 986` [ t ] he focus in construing disputed terms in claim language is.. on the objective test of what one of ordinary_skill in the art at the time of the invention would have understood the term to mean`
the trial_record however shows that those of ordinary_skill in this art at the time the patent application was filed knew that both interstitial and porous_air enhance sensitivity
dr._clay himself the inventor of the patents in suit testified that air from any source would contribute to the explosion of a heavy anfo composition and particularly air trapped within the pores of porous prilled an
therefore this court detects no error in the district_courts conclusion that` sufficient_aeration.. to enhance sensitivity' is understood by those of ordinary_skill in the art to include both interstitial and porous_air
the district_court appropriately construed the claims at issue to include aeration from both sources

iii
based on its correct interpretation of` sufficient_aeration' the district_court heard evidence on whether both interstitial and porous_air were present and enhanced sensitivity in the prior_art explosive_compositions
based on the evidence the district_court concluded that ireco had shown the inherency of the disputed claim element in the prior_art and overcome` the presumption of validity under 35 u.s.c.¡± 282 by providing clear and convincing_evidence of invalidity'
this court must determine whether the district_court committed clear_error by determining that the evidence clearly and convincingly established that` sufficient_aeration.. to enhance sensitivity' was inherent in either egly or butterworth

to invalidate a patent by anticipation a prior_art_reference normally needs to disclose each and every limitation of the claim
see standard havens prods. inc. v. gencor indus. inc. 953_f.2d_1360 1369 21_uspq2d_1321 1328 fed.cir.1991
however a prior_art_reference may anticipate when the claim limitation or limitations not expressly found in that reference are nonetheless inherent in it
see id
; verdegaal_bros. inc. v. union oil co. of cal. 814_f.2d_628 630 2_uspq2d_1051 1053 fed.cir.1987
under the principles of inherency if the prior_art necessarily functions in accordance with or includes the claimed limitations it anticipates
see in re_king 801_f.2d_1324 1326 231_uspq_136 138 fed.cir.1986
inherency is not necessarily coterminous with the knowledge of those of ordinary_skill in the art
see titanium_metals 778 f.2d at 780
artisans of ordinary_skill may not recognize the inherent characteristics or functioning of the prior_art
see id.at 782
however the discovery of a previously unappreciated property of a prior_art composition or of a scientific explanation for the prior_arts functioning does not render the old composition patentably new to the discoverer
see id.at 782` congress has not seen fit to permit the patenting of an old [ composition ] known to others.. by one who has discovered its.. useful properties
`` ; verdegaal_bros. 814 f.2d at 633

this courts decision in titanium_metals illustrates these principles
see titanium_metals 778 f.2d at 775
in titanium_metals the patent applicants sought a patent for a titanium_alloy containing various ranges of nickel molybdenum iron and *1348 titanium
the claims also required that the alloy be` characterized by good corrosion resistance in hot brine environments'
titanium_metals 778 f.2d at 776
a prior_art_reference disclosed a titanium_alloy falling within the claimed ranges but did not disclose any corrosion-resistant properties
this court affirmed a decision of the pto board of appeals finding the claimed invention unpatentable as anticipated
this court concluded that the claimed alloy was not novel noting that` it is immaterial on the issue of their novelty what inherent properties the alloys have or whether these applicants discovered certain inherent properties'
id.at 782
this same reasoning holds true when it is not a property but an ingredient which is inherently contained in the prior_art
the public remains free to make use or sell prior_art_compositions or processes regardless of whether or not they understand their complete makeup or the underlying scientific principles which allow them to operate
the doctrine of anticipation by inherency among other doctrines enforces that basic principle

the trial_record contains exhaustive evidence regarding the inherency of both interstitial and porous_air in the egly and butterworth compositions within the overlapping ranges
the testimony from expert witnesses for both parties established that whether sufficient_air is present in the explosive_composition to facilitate detonation is a function of the ratio of the emulsion to the solid_constituent
dr._clay testified that` if you mix porous_prills for example with 30 % typical water-in-oil_emulsions youre going to have air in there and it will detonate'
another of atlas experts testified that a mixture of 30 % of either an egly or a butterworth emulsion mixed with 70 % standard fertilizer grade porous an would have interstitial_air assuming nothing was done to disturb the size distribution of the an prills
the other experts agreed that the emulsions described in both egly and butterworth would inevitably and inherently have interstitial_air remaining in the mixture up to a ratio of approximately 40 %_emulsion to 60 %_solid_constituent
the expert_testimony supports the district_courts conclusion that` sufficient_aeration' is inherent in both egly and butterworth

the district_court also relied on evidence from several tests which showed that` sufficient_aeration.. to enhance sensitivity' was inherently present within the overlapping ranges of the clay_patents and egly and butterworth
in tests conducted with porous prilled an combined with fo stable_detonations were obtained in every 8' diameter bore hole test where the percentage of emulsion ranged from 30 % to 42.5 %
butterworth specifically discloses the use of porous prilled an
butterworth p. 3 ll
35-50
these tests therefore support the finding that` [ t ] he emulsions described by butterworth combined with the ratios of anfo disclosed by butterworth would inevitably and inherently have interstitial_air remaining up to approximately 40 %_emulsion'
the district_court also found that the solid an disclosed in egly would have included porous_prills
these tests therefore further support the courts finding that` emulsions described in the egly_patent combined with either an or anfo would inevitably and inherently have interstitial_air remaining in the mixture up to approximately 40 %_emulsion to 60 %_solid_constituent'
this court discerns no clear_error in the district_courts conclusion that` sufficient_aeration' was inherent in each anticipating prior_art_reference

because` sufficient_aeration' was inherent in the prior_art it is irrelevant that the prior_art did not recognize the key aspect of dr._clays alleged invention - that air may act as the sole sensitizer of the explosive_composition
an inherent structure composition or function is not *1349 necessarily known
see e.g. in re_king 801 f.2d at 1327 ; titanium_metals 778 f.2d at 782
once it is recognized that interstitial and porous_air were inherent elements of the prior_art_compositions the assertion that air may act as a sole sensitizer amounts to no more than a claim to the discovery of an inherent property of the prior_art not the addition of a novel element
insufficient prior understanding of the inherent properties of a known composition does not defeat a finding of anticipation
see titanium_metals 778 f.2d at 782
in addition there was evidence that butterworth did recognize the functioning of interstitial and porous_air in sensitizing the composition
butterworth recognizes the need for a gaseous_sensitizer
butterworth p. 2 ll
38-56
it teaches that the` sensitizer may be a gaseous_sensitizer present in the composition in the form of gas bubbles or discrete particles containing an entrapped gas such as air'
id. p. 2 ll
41-45
although this typically suggests use of a gassing agent or microballoons butterworth expressly recognizes that in certain ranges i.e. 50 % to 70 % by weight of anfo the mixture of porous prilled an and fo alone provides the necessary sensitization
see id. p. 3 ll
37-50
the district_court found that butterworth thus inherently appreciates that interstitial and porous_air may serve as the necessary sensitizer
this court discerns no clear_error in that finding

in reaching this judgment this court notes that egly teaches away from air entrapment
specifically egly teaches that it is desirable to` fill all spaces in between each particle to give added density'
egly col._1,_ll._26-27
this statement in egly however does not defeat the district_courts finding of anticipation for several reasons
first eglys teaching does not in any way discredit the trial_courts alternative reliance on butterworth for invalidation of the clay_patent and its reissue
more important the statement in egly is in fact only a showing that egly did not recognize the function of the inherently present interstitial_air
as noted previously an insufficient scientific understanding does not defeat a showing of inherency
in fact even in egly itself the only way taught for removing interstitial_air is the addition of more emulsion
see id. col._1,_ll._50-55
egly however teaches the use of a broad range - between 20 % and 67 % by weight - of water-in-oil_emulsion
see id. col._3,_ll._21-24
while egly_compositions containing amounts approaching 67 % by weight of water-in-oil_emulsions may have little or no entrapped air the evidence established that at emulsion levels below 40 % egly_compositions` inevitably and inherently' trap sufficient amounts of air to enhance sensitivity
this evidence included both substantial_amounts of expert_testimony and data showing extensive testing of egly_compositions

finally although the record showed that special mixing techniques - such as grinding and screening the an particles - remove interstitial_air from the blasting compositions egly did not teach or suggest any such techniques
thus although egly may have suggested removal of air it nonetheless inherently contained interstitial aeration sufficient to enhance sensitivity when comprised of elements within the clay_patent ranges
consequently this court discerns no clear_error in the district_courts conclusion that egly_compositions within the range of the clay_patent_claims inherently contain sufficient_air to enhance sensitivity

based upon all the evidence substantial_amounts of which were not before the pto in its reissue examination the district_court concluded that ireco had proven
clearly and convincingly that unless extraordinary measures are taken to grind and screen ammonium_nitrate the existence of` interstitial_air' or sufficient *1350 aeration to sustain a stable_detonation is a function of the ratios of emulsion to solid_constituent
specifically at ratios of 30 %_emulsion and 70 %_solid_constituent which are common to the clay patent the egly_patent and the butterworth patent there is inherently sufficient_aeration to sustain a stable_detonation barring extraordinary efforts to grind and screen the ammonium_nitrate used in the solid_constituent
this court discerns no clear_error in the district_courts factual determination that the prior_art inherently possesses sufficient_aeration to enhance sensitivity to a substantial_degree within the overlapping ranges
nor does this court discern clear_error in the district_courts finding of anticipation based on either egly or butterworth
to uphold the clay_patent and its reissue would preclude the public from practicing the prior_art

iii
in conclusion this court affirms the district_courts finding of invalidity with respect to claims 1 2 3 10 12 13 and 14 of the clay_patent and the clay_reissue_patent
this court therefore does not address the district_courts additional finding of non-infringement
