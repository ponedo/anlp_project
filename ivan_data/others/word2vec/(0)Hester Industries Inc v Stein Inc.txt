opinion
plager circuit_judge
hester_industries inc.` hester' appeals from a summary_judgment of invalidity entered by the united_states_district_court for the eastern_district of virginia
the district_court ruled that the reissue_patent_claims asserted by hester against stein inc.` stein' are invalid for failing to meet the statutory` error' and` original_patent' requirements for reissue_patents set forth in 35 u.s.c.¡± 251 ?

hester indus. inc. v. stein inc. 963_f.supp._1403 e.d.va.1997
stein cross-appeals a pretrial oral ruling in which the district_court adopted hesters proposed construction of the claim_term` high_humidity_steam'

because the asserted_reissue_claims impermissibly recapture subject_matter surrendered by hester through deliberate arguments repeatedly made to the patent_office to overcome prior_art we hold that hester is barred from asserting` error' within the meaning of 35 u.s.c.¡± 251 ?
1
we accordingly affirm the summary_judgment of invalidity
because the asserted claims are invalid we need not and do not reach the claim_construction_issue

background
at issue in this case are two reissue_patents u.s._patent no
re
33,510 the`510 reissue_patent' and u.s._patent no
re
35,259 the`259 reissue_patent'
the two patents are reissues of the same_original_patent u.s._patent no._4582,047 the`047_patent` or` original_patent' which they replaced pursuant to 35 u.s.c.¡± 251.2 the patents are directed to a high_humidity_steam cooker having a continuously running conveyor for cooking food items such as poultry and other_meat_products
hester a processor of pre-cooked poultry and other_meat_products owns the patents and charles e. williams` williams' a hester employee is the sole named inventor
after the259 reissue_patent the second reissue issued in 1996 hester sued stein a manufacturer of industrial appliances for allegedly infringing several reissue_claims in the two reissue_patents

the two reissue_patents and the original_patent have the same written description ; the patents differ only with respect to their claims
that written description describes an industrial-size steam cooker for cooking large quantities of food_products
the cooker is described as having a cooker_chamber in which a steam_atmosphere is maintained
the food_products are carried through the cooker_chamber on a conveyor_belt that runs through a spiral_path
the written description teaches that efficient_cooking is achieved without the loss of humidity flavor or appearance by maintaining a water-drop-free steam_atmosphere within the chamber at near 100¢X_c and 100 %_humidity at above atmospheric_pressure

two separate_sources of steam one internal and one external are described for maintaining the steam_atmosphere
the internal_source of steam described is a pool of water on the floor of the cooker_chamber heated by a heating_element in the pool
the external source described is a steam_generator located outside the cooker_chamber and connected by pipes to various locations within the cooker_chamber to inject steam at those locations
the written description states that the external steam_source typically provides 25 % of *1475 the steam with the remainder provided by the internal_source
'047_patent col._3,_ll._42-45 57-59
the heating_element in the internal steam_source is controlled to maintain the desired amount of steam and pressure within the cooker_chamber
id
col._3,_ll._59-63

the section of the written description entitled detailed description of the preferred embodiment describes the cooking atmosphere thus the cooking is solely with water droplet free steam near 100¢X_c. and 100 %_humidity at a pressure above atmospheric
the high humidity atmosphere prevents losses of humidity of the product as it passes through the cooker and helps retain juices essences and flavor of the product
also it improves the heating steam interface heat exchange at the product surface for more efficient_cooking
the higher pressure not only produces a pressure-cooker like cooking efficiency to the cooking_process but is critical in connection with the flavor and conveyor type product flow as well
id
col._3,_ll._22-33

the original_patent contains one independent_claim claim 1 directed to a food_cooking_system
the claim specifies that the cooking_system cooks solely with steam and that the system includes two sources of steam to provide the steam_atmosphere
characteristics of the steam_atmosphere are set forth and the cooking_system is said to include a means passing a conveyor_belt through the cooker_housing
claim 1 with relevant text emphasized reads a food_cooking_system cooking solely with steam foods such as fish fowl meats or produce carried through a cooker on a continuously running conveyor_belt comprising in combination a cooker_housing means passing said conveyor_belt through said housing to expose food_products within the cooker_housing only to said steam as the sole_cooking_medium and two sources of steam providing said steam to cook the food_products nozzles for releasing steam located inside said housing one comprising a steam_generator supplying supplemental_steam into said housing at said nozzles located thereinside to maintain the atmosphere together with the other_steam_source at near 100 %_humidity 100¢X_c. and a pressure above atmospheric and the other source of steam comprising a pool of water within said housing with heating_means for boiling the water to create steam
id
col._5,_l._59 to col._6,_l._8
for purposes here this is substantially the same form in which the claim was first filed as application_claim 1 in the application for the original_patent
accordingly we do not distinguish between the issued claim and the application_claim but instead simply refer to claim 1

in addition to the independent_claim the original_patent contains several claims which are dependent upon claim 1
relevant here is dependent claim 12 which specifies in pertinent_part` a system as defined in claim 1 wherein the conveyor_belt is passed inside said housing in a spiral_path coiling downwardly..' id
col._6,_ll._59-61 emphasis added
this claim stemmed from original_application_claim 16 which specified that the conveyor_belt is` passed.. in a spiral_path'

the application for the047_patent the original_patent was filed in 1979
the patent did not issue until 1986 nearly seven years later
over the almost seven years in which the application was prosecuted before the united states patent and trademark office` patent_office' inventor williams through his attorney repeatedly emphasized the` solely with steam' and` two sources of steam' features of the claimed invention in attempting to establish patentability over the prior_art
for example after the examiner first rejected claim 1 as well as all the other claims as obvious office_action of feb._6,_1980 at 2 williams distinguished a cited prior_art cooker that cooked with a combination of infra-red dry heat and steam on the ground that the claimed invention cooked solely with steam stating` this principle is completely different from applicants invention where the claims define cooking solely with steam'
applicant_response of apr._28,_1980 emphasis in original
williams also distinguished claim 1 on the basis of the` two sources of steam' limitation the specified characteristics of the steam_atmosphere and *1476 the recited continuously running conveyor_belt
id

application claim 16 which specified a spiral_conveyance_path was rejected as obvious in view of an additional prior_art cooker that included a spiral conveyor
office_action of feb._6,_1980 at 4
in response williams amended claim 16 to specify further details of the spiral_conveyance_path and then argued that the claimed spiral_conveyance_path was distinguished from that shown in the prior_art
applicant_response of apr._28,_1980

however the examiner continued to reject all claims as obvious
office_action of july_9,_1980
at that point williams placed even greater reliance on the` solely with steam' and` two sources of steam' limitations in an attempt to overcome the obviousness_rejection
for example in his first_appeal of the obviousness_rejection to the board of patent appeals and interferences` board' williams stated` the claimed system cooks solely with steam.. by means of two separate and critical steam_sources..' applicant_brief on appeal at 2 aug._20,_1980 emphasis in original
later in the same brief williams specifically distinguished the cited prior_art on the basis of these limitations the primary reference vischer cooks with ir radiation not steam
clearly the claimed feature of cooking solely with steam is directly contrary to the teaching of the vischer patent which could therefore never make obvious any process or equipment cooking solely with steam as claimed
...
the examiner errs in any implication that jourdan shows two sources of steam
id.at 9-10 emphasis in original

prior to the board hearing williams appeal the examiner reopened prosecution on the merits in view of newly discovered prior_art thereby removing the appeal from the board.3 office_action of mar._17,_1981
the examiner then rejected all of the claims as obvious over the new prior_art
id
in response williams distinguished claim 1 over that prior_art on the same bases i.e. the` solely with steam' and` two sources of steam' limitations
applicant_response to office_action apr._17,_1981
however the examiner was not persuaded even after these same_arguments were repeated in subsequent papers submitted to the patent_office

accordingly williams initiated a second appeal to the board
he again emphasized the` solely with steam' and` two sources of steam' limitations
applicant_brief on appeal at 13 dec._22,_1981
he explained that the two sources of steam interact to provide a` synergy' that is` novel and nowhere suggested in any of the cited [ prior ] art'
id
williams drove home his reliance on the` solely with steam' limitation most forcefully in his reply brief to the board` clearly the examiner reversibly errs as a matter of fact and in his efforts to make a case out against the very_material claimed feature that steam is the sole_cooking_medium claim 1
thus reversal is respectfully solicited'
applicant reply brief on appeal at 6 sep. 30 1982 emphasis in original

the board was persuaded and accordingly reversed the obviousness_rejection in its opinion dated june_21,_1985 stating [ w ] e find no suggestion in the combined teachings of the references which would have led the ordinarily skilled worker in the art to an apparatus utilizing steam as the sole_cooking_medium ; utilizing two separate_sources of steam one of which includes a pool of water in the cooking_chamber with means for boiling the water ; and wherein the atmosphere within the cooking_chamber is maintained above atmospheric by the two sources of steam
thereafter the claims were allowed and the application issued as the047_patent on april_15,_1986

on the two-year anniversary of the047_patents issuance williams applied for a reissue pursuant to 35 u.s.c.¡± 251 alleging that the patent_claims had been drawn too narrowly due to attorney error
in the required oath accompanying the reissue application williams explained that he became *1477 aware of this alleged_error after learning that stein was in the process of developing a competing cooker in early 1988
according to his oath williams and his employer hester concluded that the047_patent should cover the stein cooker notwithstanding the fact that the cooker used a non-steam heat source and only one source of steam in the cooking_process
williams further explained that hesters present counsel advised hester that the047_patent_claims as written might not cover steins cooker
thus williams by oath declared that the patent was insufficient because it claimed less than he had a right to claim

specifically williams identified two relevant deficiencies of the047_patent as follows indentation and numbering added4

[ 1 ] that each of claims 1-14 therein requires cooking` solely with steam' and exposing food_products within the cooker_housing` only to said steam as the sole_cooking_medium'.. [ and ] [ 2 ] that each of claims 1-14 therein requires` two sources of steam providing said steam to cook the food_products nozzles for releasing steam located inside said housing' [ ]
these deficiencies according to williams` arose after [ he ] executed and filed the original_application from which the047_patent issued' and were caused by` the failure of [ his prior ] patent attorney.. to appreciate the full_scope of [ his ] invention'
this application ripened into the510 reissue_patent nearly three years later on january 1 1991
however prior to its issuance williams filed a second_reissue_application for reasons not relevant here on june_21,_1990 alleging the same errors used to support the first reissue
six years later this second_reissue_application issued as the259 reissue_patent
hester then filed this action accusing stein of infringing two claims in the first reissue_patent and six claims in the second
specifically hester accused stein of infringing reissue_claims 26_and_59 of the510 reissue_patent and reissue_claims 28 30 31 32 75 and 76 of the259 reissue_patent

the requirement in original_claim 1 that cooking is` solely with steam' is absent from each of the asserted_reissue_claims
also absent is the` two sources of steam' limitation
rather the asserted_reissue_claims merely recite a source of steam or at least one source of steam
none of the asserted_reissue_claims explicitly recite the steam_atmosphere characteristics specified in original_claim 1 i.e. the characteristics of near 100¢X_c and 100 %_humidity at above atmospheric_pressure
instead all but one of the asserted_reissue_claims recite` high_humidity_steam
`` 5

claim 26 of the510 reissue_patent is representative of the two asserted_reissue_claims in that patent
it provides in pertinent_part a food_cooking_system for cooking food_products carried on a moving conveyor_belt comprising a cooker_housing [ ] means disposed within said housing for defining a conveyance_path a conveyor_belt disposed along said conveyance_path for supporting and conveying said food_products along said path means coupled to said belt for causing said belt and said food_products supported thereby to substantially continually translate along said conveyance_path.. and
a source of steam providing steam to contact and cook the food_products said steam_source comprising at least one of the following an external steam_generator supplying steam into said housing and
a pool of water within said housing with heating_means communicating with said pool of water for creating steam.. [ ] *1478 wherein said steam_source provides high_humidity_steam and said food_products are directly exposed to said high_humidity_steam
'510_patent col._8,_ll._8-31 36-38 emphasis added and text of claim 24 upon which claim 26 depends incorporated

the asserted_reissue_claims of the259 reissue_patent are for purposes here substantially similar
one difference is that several of these claims explicitly recite a` spiral_conveyance_path'
claim 28 which is representative provides in pertinent_part a spiral steam cooker for at least partially cooking exposed food_products said cooker comprising a housing defining an internal_volume therein ; a conveyor_belt at least partially disposed along a spiral_conveyance_path within said internal_volume.. ; and
a steam_source operatively coupled to said housing said steam_source providing a high_humidity_steam_atmosphere within said internal_volume said high_humidity_steam_atmosphere directly contacting and at least partially cooking the exposed food_products..259_patent col._9,_l._61 to col._10,_l._12 emphasis added

before the district_court stein moved for summary_judgment that the asserted_reissue_claims are invalid for failing to meet the requirements of the reissue_statute 35 u.s.c.¡± 251
that section with emphasis added reads whenever any patent is through error without any deceptive intention deemed wholly or partly inoperative or invalid by reason of a defective specification or drawing or by reason of the patentee claiming more or less than he had a right to claim in the patent the commissioner shall on the surrender of such patent and the payment of the fee required by law reissue the patent for the invention disclosed in the original_patent and in accordance with a new and amended application for the unexpired part of the term of the original_patent
no new matter shall be introduced into the application for reissue

in particular stein argued that the` error' requirement of ¡± 251 ?
1 as well as the requirement therein that the reissue_claims be` for the invention disclosed in the original_patent' the` original_patent' requirement were not met
with regard to the` error' requirement stein argued that williams had not erred in including the` solely with steam' and` two sources of steam' limitations in the original_claims and further argued that the removal of those limitations violated the` recapture' rule
stein further argued that the asserted_reissue_claims violated the` original_patent' requirement because stein asserted the original_patent does not evidence an` objective' intent to claim the invention in the manner of the asserted_reissue_claims

the district_court granted steins motion
the court first concluded that there was no` error' as contemplated by ¡± 251 ?
1
specifically the court concluded that the alleged failure of counsel to appreciate the scope of the invention was belied by the clear language in the original_patent_claims the prosecution_history of the patent and the absence of any explanation as to the nature or cause of the attorneys failure to appreciate the full_scope of the invention
hester 963 f.supp.at 1408
the court did not reach steins assertion that the asserted_reissue_claims violate the recapture_rule though the court relied heavily on the original_patents prosecution_history in determining that the` error' requirement was not met
see id.at 1409-11

the district_court ruled that the asserted_reissue_claims are alternatively invalid for failing to meet the` original_patent' requirement
id.at 1412
the district_court concluded that the` original_patent' clause of ¡± 251 ?
1 includes a separate_requirement that the original_patent manifest an` objective' intent to claim the invention as later claimed on reissue
id.at 1412-13 the court concluded that the original_patent does not manifest such an objective_intent and thus the claims are also invalid under the` original_patent' clause of ¡± 251 ?
1
id.at 1412-15

in its appeal of the invalidity judgment hester argues that the district_court erred in concluding that the` error' and` original_patent' requirements of ¡± 251 ?
1 were not met
*1479 stein in seeking to uphold the judgment makes the same_arguments presented to the district_court in its motion for summary_judgment
hester on the other hand argues that the` error' requirement was met by way of prior patent counsels failure to appreciate the full_scope of the invention
hester further asserts that the recapture_rule is inapplicable because the reissue_claims were never presented during prosecution of the original_patent and later abandoned by amendment or cancellation
with regard to the` original_patent' clause of ¡± 251 ?
1 hester submits that there is no separate_requirement of a manifestation of an objective_intent to claim

also at issue on appeal is the district_courts resolution of a` motion for claim interpretation' brought by stein
in that motion stein argued that the claim_term` high_humidity_steam' should be construed in accordance with the only specific description of the steam_atmosphere provided in the patents i.e. as water-droplet-free steam near 100¢X_c and 100 %_humidity at above atmospheric_pressure
hester relying on the opinion of its expert proposed a broader construction arguing that the description contained in the patents is merely one example of` high_humidity_steam'
the district_court in a ruling delivered from the bench prior to holding the asserted_reissue_claims invalid adopted hesters proposed construction of the claim_term
the ruling was never reduced to a formal order or judgment
the parties by way of cross-appeal by stein present the same issue on appeal

discussion
i
in reviewing the summary_judgment of invalidity we keep in mind that summary_judgment is appropriate only when the record shows that` there is no genuine_issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law'
fed.r.civ.p
56 c
whether the statutory requirements of 35 u.s.c.¡± 251 have been met is a question of law
see in re clement 131_f.3d_1464 1468 45_uspq2d_1161 1163 fed.cir.1997
this legal_conclusion can involve underlying factual questions
see id

ii
as previously explained the` error' and` original_patent' requirements at issue here are found in the first paragraph of ¡± 251
the` error' requirement limits the availability of a reissue_patent to certain correctable errors
see in re amos 953_f.2d_613 616 21_uspq2d_1271 1273 fed.cir.1991
as seen in the above-emphasized text of ¡± 251 one such correctable error is the patentee claiming his invention too broadly or too narrowly.6 see id

the` original_patent' requirement is a second and independent requirement see amos 953 f.2d at 615 21 uspq2d at 1272 which restricts a reissue_patent to` the invention disclosed in the original_patent'
35 u.s.c.¡± 251 ?
1
we address each of these requirements in turn

a
1
in considering the` error' requirement we keep in mind that the reissue_statute is` based on fundamental_principles of equity and fairness and should be construed liberally'
in re weiler 790_f.2d_1576 1579 229_uspq_673 675 fed.cir.1986
we also keep in mind that` not every event or circumstance that might be labelederror is correctable by reissue'
id
indeed the reissue_procedure does not give the patentee the right` to prosecute de novo his original_application'
id.at 1582 790_f.2d_1576 229 uspq at 677 ; see also mentor corp. v. coloplast inc. 998_f.2d_992 995 27_uspq2d_1521 1524 fed.cir.1993

one of the most commonly asserted` errors' in support of a broadening reissue is the failure of the patentees attorney to appreciate the full_scope of the invention during the prosecution of the original_patent_application
see *1480 amos 953 f.2d at 616 21 uspq2d at 1273 ; in re wilder 736_f.2d_1516 1519 222_uspq_369 371 fed.cir.1984
this form of error has generally been accepted as sufficient to satisfy the` error' requirement of ¡± 251
see clement 131 f.3d at 1468 45 uspq2d at 1163 ; wilder 736 f.2d at 1519 222 uspq at 371
williams asserted this form of error as the basis for his reissue applications and the patent_office accepted his assertion as adequate

however the district_court concluded that there was no such error by williams attorney
hester 963 f.supp.at 1411
in reaching this conclusion the court was particularly persuaded by the prosecution_history of the original_patent
the court concluded that the attorneys repeated attempts to distinguish williams invention on the basis of the` solely with steam' and` two sources of steam' limitations belied williams assertion that his attorney failed to appreciate the full_scope of his invention
id.at 1409-11
the court also determined that there was no other form of ¡± 251` error' and thus held the asserted_reissue_claims invalid
id.at 1411-12

2
we share the district_courts discomfort with williams attempt to remove through reissue the` solely with steam' and` two sources of steam' limitations after having relied so heavily on those limitations to obtain allowance of the original_patent_claims over the prior_art
this concern is addressed most squarely by the` recapture_rule' recently discussed at length in clement 131_f.3d_1464 45_uspq2d_1161
the recapture_rule` prevents a patentee from regaining through reissue.. subject_matter that he surrendered in an effort to obtain allowance of the original_claims'
clement 131 f.3d at 1468 45 uspq2d at 1164
the rule is rooted in the` error' requirement in that such a surrender is not the type of correctable` error' contemplated by the reissue_statute
see mentor 998 f.2d at 995-96 27 uspq2d at 1525

in its motion for summary_judgment stein presented the recapture_rule as one basis for finding the asserted_reissue_claims invalid and stein repeats this argument on appeal as one basis for affirming the summary_judgment of invalidity
while the district_court did not explicitly rule on this ground its opinion indicates the view that hester through the reissue_patents recaptured surrendered subject_matter
hester 963 f.supp.at 1412 stating that through the reissues hester obtained claims covering` ovens with characteristics repeatedly distinguished and disclaimed in the pto' and that that was contrary to the` error' requirement of ¡± 251
as will be next explained we conclude that the asserted_reissue_claims violate the recapture_rule and that the summary_judgment ruling is appropriately affirmed on this ground

`` under [ the recapture ] rule claims that arebroader than the original_patent_claims in a manner directly pertinent to the subject_matter surrendered during prosecution are impermissible'
clement 131 f.3d at 1468 45 uspq2d at 1164 quoting mentor 998 f.2d at 996 27 uspq2d at 1525
application of the recapture_rule begins with a determination of whether and in what respect the reissue_claims are broader than the original_patent_claims
see id
a reissue_claim that does not include a limitation present in the original_patent_claims is broader in that respect
see id
here it is undisputed that the asserted_reissue_claims are broader than the original_patent_claims in that the reissue_claims do not include the` solely with steam' and` two sources of steam' limitations found in each of the original_patent_claims

having determined that the reissue_claims are broader in these respects under the recapture_rule we next examine whether these broader aspects relate to surrendered subject_matter
see id.at 1468-69 131_f.3d_1464 45 uspq2d at 1164
`` to determine whether an applicant surrendered particular subject_matter we look to the prosecution_history for arguments and changes to the claims made in an effort to overcome a prior_art_rejection'
id.at 1469 131_f.3d_1464 45 uspq2d at 1164 emphasis added
this statement in clement indicates that a surrender can occur by way of arguments or claim changes made during the prosecution of the *1481 original_patent_application
to date the cases in which this court has found an impermissible recapture have involved claim_amendments or cancellations
see e.g. id.at 1469-70 131_f.3d_1464 45 uspq2d at 1164-65 ; mentor 998 f.2d at 995-96 27 uspq2d at 1524-25
however in addition to the suggestion in clement that argument alone can effect a surrender this court expressly left open that possibility in ball corp. v. united states` if reissue is sought where claims have not been previously canceled analysis becomes more difficult
in that case relative claim_scope is not available to illuminate the alleged_error
we are not faced with that situation in this proceeding'
729_f.2d_1429 1436_n._19 221_uspq_289 295_n._19_(fed.cir.1984)
prior to this case this court has not squarely addressed the question

this courts prior opinions indicate that as a general proposition in determining whether there is a surrender the prosecution_history of the original_patent should be examined for evidence of an admission by the patent applicant regarding patentability
see clement 131 f.3d at 1468 45 uspq2d at 1164 noting that with regard to claim_amendments the recapture_rule does not apply in the absence of evidence that the amendment was an admission that the scope of the claim was not patentable ; mentor 998 f.2d at 995 27 uspq2d at 1524 same ; seattle box co. v. industrial crating & packing inc. 731_f.2d_818 826 221_uspq_568 574 fed.cir.1984 declining to apply the recapture_rule when there was no evidence that the` amendment.. was in any sense an admission that the scope of [ the ] claim was not patentable'
in this regard claim_amendments are relevant because an amendment to overcome a prior_art_rejection evidences an admission that the claim was not patentable
see mentor 998 f.2d at 995-96 27 uspq2d at 1524-25 finding surrender by way of claim_amendments ; ball 729 f.2d at 1436 221 uspq at 294 noting that a court may draw inferences from changes in claim_scope

arguments made to overcome prior_art can equally evidence an admission sufficient to give rise to a finding of surrender
indeed in mentor and clement the findings of a surrender were based in part on the arguments made in conjunction with the claim_amendments
mentor 998 f.2d at 995-96 27 uspq2d at 1524-25 ; clement 131 f.3d at 1470-71 45 uspq2d at 1165-66
logically this is true even when the arguments are made in the absence of any claim_amendment
amendment of a claim is not the only permissible predicate for establishing a surrender

the view that arguments alone can give rise to a surrender is consistent with the policy behind the reissue_statute and the accompanying recapture_rule
as already noted the reissue_statute is` based on fundamental_principles of equity and fairness'
weiler 790 f.2d at 1579 229 uspq at 675
there is no unfairness in binding the patentee to deliberate assertions made in order to obtain allowance of the original_patent_claims over the prior_art
indeed fairness to the public must also be considered
in this regard as stated in mentor` the reissue_statute can not be construed in such a way that competitors properly relying on prosecution_history become patent infringers when they do so'
998 f.2d at 996 27 uspq2d at 1525
the recapture_rule operates to prevent this from happening
see id
furthermore as recognized in ball the recapture_rule is based on principles of equity and therefore embodies the notion of estoppel
729 f.2d at 1439 221 uspq at 296

indeed the recapture_rule is quite similar to prosecution_history_estoppel which prevents the application of the doctrine of equivalents in a manner_contrary to the patents prosecution_history
see warner-jenkinson co. v. hilton davis chem co. 520_u.s._17 -- -- 117_s.ct._1040 1051 137_l.ed.2d_146_(1997)
like the recapture_rule prosecution_history_estoppel prevents a patentee from regaining subject_matter surrendered during prosecution in support of patentability
see id

hester argues that an analogy can not be made with prosecution_history_estoppel because the reissue_procedure and prosecution_history_estoppel are the antithesis of one another-reissue allows an expansion of patent rights whereas prosecution_history_estoppel *1482 is limiting
however hesters argument is unpersuasive
the analogy is not to the broadening aspect of reissues
rather the analogy is with the recapture_rule which restricts the permissible_range of expansion through reissue just as prosecution_history_estoppel restricts the permissible_range of equivalents under the doctrine of equivalents

this court earlier concluded that prosecution_history_estoppel can arise by way of unmistakable assertions made to the patent_office in support of patentability just as it can by way of amendments to avoid prior_art
see e.g. texas instruments inc. v. international trade comm n 988_f.2d_1165 1174 26_uspq2d_1018 1025 fed.cir.1993
the same reasoning that led us to conclude that arguments alone can give rise to prosecution_history_estoppel lends support to the proposition that arguments alone can give rise to a surrender for purposes of the recapture_rule

thus we conclude that in a proper case a surrender can occur through arguments alone
we next evaluate whether such a surrender occurred here with respect to the` solely with steam' and` two sources of steam' limitations the pertinent aspects in which the asserted_reissue_claims are broader than the original_patent_claims
the obvious conclusion is that there has been a surrender

as detailed above williams repeatedly argued that the` solely with steam' and` two sources of steam' limitations distinguished the original_claims from the prior_art
these were williams primary_bases for distinguishing the broadest claim independent_claim 1 from the prior_art
at no less than 27 places in six papers submitted to the patent_office williams asserted that the` solely with steam' limitation distinguished the claimed invention from the prior_art and williams did the same with respect to the` two sources of steam' limitation at no less than 15 places in at least five papers

williams argued that each of these limitations was` critical' with regard to patentability and williams further stated that the` solely with steam' limitation was` very_material' in this regard
in essence these repeated arguments constitute an admission by williams that these limitations were necessary to overcome the prior_art
indeed when the board reversed the examiners rejection of the original_claims these were the primary_bases indicated for patentability
williams through his admission effected by way of his repeated prosecution arguments surrendered claim_scope that does not include these limitations

having concluded that there has been a surrender we must next determine whether the surrendered subject_matter has crept back into the asserted_reissue_claims
see clement 131 f.3d at 1469 45 uspq2d at 1164
when the surrender occurs by way of claim_amendment or cancellation` [ c ] omparing the reissue_claim with the canceled claim is one way to do this'
see id
this analysis is not available when the surrender is made by way of argument alone
instead in this case we simply analyze the asserted_reissue_claims to determine if they were obtained in a manner_contrary to the arguments on which the surrender is based

clearly they were
none of the asserted_reissue_claims include either the` solely with steam' limitation or the` two sources of steam' limitation
thus this surrendered subject_matter-i.e. cooking other than solely with steam and with at least two sources of steam-has crept into the reissue_claims
the asserted_reissue_claims are unmistakably broader in these respects

finally because the recapture_rule may be avoided in some circumstances we consider whether the reissue_claims were materially narrowed in other respects
see e.g. mentor 998 f.2d at 996 27 uspq2d at 1525` reissue claims that are broader in certain respects and narrower in others may avoid the effect of the recapture_rule
`` ; clement 131 f.3d at 1470 45 uspq2d at 1165
for example in ball the recapture_rule was avoided because the reissue_claims were sufficiently narrowed described by the court as` fundamental narrowness' despite the broadened aspects of the claims
729 f.2d at 1438 221 uspq at 296
in the context of a surrender by way of argument this principle in appropriate cases may operate to overcome the recapture_rule when the reissue_claims are materially narrower in *1483 other overlooked aspects of the invention
the purpose of this exception to the recapture_rule is to allow the patentee to obtain through reissue a scope of protection to which he is rightfully entitled for such overlooked aspects

however this is not such a case
the asserted_reissue_claims are not materially narrower despite hesters arguments to the contrary
hester argues that the claims are materially narrower by the addition of the` spiral_conveyance_path' and` high_humidity_steam' limitations
the term` high_humidity_steam' is included in each of the asserted_reissue_claims except reissue_claim 30 of the259 reissue_patent
however the term` high_humidity_steam' is actually the same as or broader than the limitation in original_claim 1 that this term replaced
original_claim 1 specifies a steam_atmosphere` at near 100 %_humidity 100¢X_c and a pressure above atmospheric.`
'047_patent col._6,_ll._3-4
hester concedes that the term` high_humidity_steam' is not narrower than this limitation in original_claim 1
in fact with respect to the claim_construction_issue hester argues that the limitation in original_claim 1 is but one example of` high_humidity_steam'
accordingly the use of the term` high_humidity_steam' does not save the reissue_claims from the recapture_rule

the term` spiral_conveyance_path' is also not materially limiting
this term appears explicitly in asserted_reissue_claims 28 32 75 and 76 of the259 reissue_patent ; it does not appear explicitly in the other reissue_claims asserted
original_claim 1 includes a corresponding limitation namely` means passing said conveyor_belt through said housing..' this is a so-called means-plus-function clause drafted pursuant to 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
6 19947 according to ¡± 112 ?
6 the clause is to be construed to` cover the corresponding structure.. described in the specification and equivalents thereof'
the only corresponding structure described in the specification more properly the written description of the patent passes the conveyor_belt through a spiral_path
see047_patent col._4,_l._64 to col._5,_l._8
thus the explicit_recitation of a` spiral_conveyance_path' in some of the asserted_reissue_claims does not materially narrow those claims
indeed hester does not explain how the explicit_recitation of a spiral_conveyance_path-which is present in prior_art cookers cited by the examiner during the prosecution of the original_patent-materially narrows these claims
in sum neither alone nor together do the terms` high_humidity_steam' and` spiral_conveyance_path' materially narrow the claims

furthermore the` spiral_conveyance_path' and` high_humidity_steam' limitations are not aspects of the invention that were overlooked during prosecution of the original_patent
to the contrary as just explained these aspects were included in original_claim 1
additionally with regard to the` spiral_conveyance_path' limitation original dependent claim 12 explicitly recites` a spiral_path'
'047_patent col._6,_l._60
in prosecuting the original_patent williams pointed out these features in an attempt to overcome the examiners obviousness_rejection
hester can not now argue that williams overlooked these aspects during the prosecution of the original_patent_application
in conclusion this is not a case which involves the addition of material limitations that overcome the recapture_rule

in effect hester through eight years of reissue proceedings prosecuted williams original_patent_application anew this time placing greater emphasis on aspects previously included in the original_patent_claims and removing limitations repeatedly relied upon to distinguish the prior_art and described as` critical' and` very_material' to the patentability of the invention
the reissue_statute is to be construed liberally but not that liberally
the realm of corrections contemplated within ¡± 251 does not include recapturing surrendered subject_matter without the addition of materially-narrowing *1484 limitations in an attempt tocustom-fit the reissue_claims to a competitors product

no doubt if two patent attorneys are given the task of drafting patent_claims for the same_invention the two attorneys will in all likelihood arrive at somewhat different claims of somewhat different scope
and such differences are even more likely when as here the second attorney drafts the new_claims nearly a decade later and with the distinct advantage of having before him the exact product offered by the now accused infringer
this reality does not justify recapturing surrendered subject_matter under the mantra of` failure to appreciate the scope of the invention'
the circumstances of the case before us simply do not fit within the concept of` error' as contemplated by the reissue_statute
see mentor 998 f.2d at 996 27 uspq2d at 1525` error under the reissue_statute does not include a deliberate decision to surrender specific subject_matter in order to overcome prior_art a decision which in light of subsequent developments in the marketplace might be regretted
``

with respect to the recapture issue there are no underlying material facts as to which there is a genuine_issue in dispute
the original_patents prosecution_history on which we rely is before us and undisputed
all that remains is the ultimate legal_conclusion as to whether the asserted_reissue_claims fail to meet the` error' requirement because the claims impermissibly recapture surrendered subject_matter
see id.at 994 998_f.2d_992 27 uspq2d at 1524 stating that whether the` error' requirement has been met is a legal_conclusion
for the reasons explained above we conclude as a matter of law that the asserted_reissue_claims fail in this regard
summary judgment of invalidity of the asserted_reissue_claims under ¡± 251 is called for
accordingly we affirm the district_courts entry of summary_judgment

b
as an alternative basis for holding the asserted_reissue_claims invalid the district_court concluded that the reissue_claims do not meet the` original_patent' clause of ¡± 251 ?
1 which requires that the reissue_patent be` for the invention disclosed in the original_patent'
hester 963 f.supp.at 1412
in reaching this conclusion the court interpreted the` original_patent' clause as requiring an` objective' intent manifested in the original_patent to claim the invention as claimed in the reissue_patent
id
the court based this interpretation on the supreme_courts statement in u.s._industrial chemicals inc. v. carbide & carbon chemicals corp. 315_u.s._668 676 62_s.ct._839 843-44 86_l.ed._1105_(1942) that there was an objective_intent requirement under the predecessor_reissue_statute 35 u.s.c.¡± 64 1964 which required that the reissue_patent be` for the same_invention'
id.at 1413

based on this construction of the` original_patent' clause the district_court framed the issue as` whether the 047 patent manifests an objective_intent to cover ovens that utilize heat sources other than steam and have less than two steam_sources'
id
the district_court concluded that the asserted_reissue_claims failed to meet this test and thus were invalid under the` original_patent' clause
id.at 1413-15
on appeal the parties focus on whether the` original_patent' clause embodies the requirement of an objective_intent to claim

this court squarely addressed the issue in amos 953 f.2d at 616 21 uspq2d at 1273
the amos_court held that ¡± 251 does not include a separate_requirement of an objective_intent to claim
953 f.2d at 618-19 21 uspq2d at 1275-76
rather the court concluded` the essential inquiry under theoriginal_patent clause of ¡± 251.. is whether one skilled in the art reading the specification would identify the subject_matter of the new_claims as invented and disclosed by the patentees'
id.at 618 953_f.2d_613 21 uspq2d at 1275
the court noted that this inquiry is analogous to the` written description' requirement of 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
1 1994
id
the court further stated that to the extent the construct of an objective_intent to claim is useful it is` only one factor that sheds light' on whether the` original_patent' clause of ¡± 251 is satisfied
id.at 619 & n. 2 21 uspq2d at 1275-76 & n. 2 quoting *1485 in re hounsfield 699_f.2d_1320 1323 216_uspq_1045 1047-48 fed.cir.1983

with regard to the supreme_courts opinion in u.s._industrial 315_u.s._668 62_s.ct._839 86_l.ed._1105 the amos_court noted that that case was decided under the predecessor_reissue_statute which required reissue_claims to be for the` same_invention' and concluded that u.s._industrial does not now mandate a separate` objective_intent to claim' requirement
id
the amos_court noted that this court reached the same conclusion eight years earlier in hounsfield 699 f.2d at 1323 216 uspq at 1047-48
id

thus the district_courts conclusion that the` original_patent' clause of ¡± 251 was not satisfied based on an` objective_intent to claim' requirement was in error
stein does not contend that the test set forth in amos for the` original_patent' clause-i.e. whether one skilled in the art would identify the subject_matter of the reissue_claims as invented and disclosed by the patentee-is not met by the asserted_reissue_claims
rather stein relies entirely on its assertion that there is an` objective_intent to claim' requirement and that that requirement is not met
however we need not resolve this issue further having already concluded that the asserted_reissue_claims are invalid for failing to meet the` error' requirement of ¡± 251

iii
finally stein presents to us the question of whether the district_court properly construed the claim_term` high_humidity_steam'
it is not immediately apparent whether this issue is properly before us
the district_court did not construe the term in conjunction with a final judgment such as a summary_judgment of noninfringement or invalidity
rather the district_court issued an oral ruling on the matter in preparation for trial
however the district_court having held the asserted claims invalid on summary_judgment which we here affirm there can be no question of liability and hence the claim_construction_issue is moot
therefore we need not decide whether steins appeal of the claim_construction is proper and if so whether the district_courts construction was correct

conclusion
we affirm the grant of summary_judgment of invalidity of the asserted_reissue_claims for failure to comply with 35 u.s.c.¡± 251 ?
