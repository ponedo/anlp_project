*1304 newman circuit_judge
zoltek_corporation seeks compensation from the united_states for use with the authorization and consent of the departments of the air force and navy of the patented_method of producing carbon_fiber_sheet_products as claimed in united_states reissue patent no
re 34,162 issued january 19 1993` the ¡¬162_patent`
the ¡¬162_patent is a reissue of u.s._patent_no._4728,395 issued march_1,_1988 to inventor george boyd and assigned to mr. boyds employer stackpole fibers company
the patent was acquired by zoltek_corporation with its acquisition of stackpole in 1988

litigation history
on march_25,_1996 zoltek filed suit in the united_states_court of federal_claims cfc alleging that the process used to produce carbon_fiber_sheet_materials for the b-2_bomber and the f-22_fighter plane infringed the ¡¬162_patent
this is the third appeal in this action
the factual background is set forth in the prior opinions of the cfc and this court

in the first appeal this court answered a certified question to hold that the patentee has no cause of action against the united_states when any step of the patented_method is practiced outside of the united_states as for the f-22_fighter
zoltek_corporation v. united_states 442_f.3d_1345 1353 fed.cir.2006 plager j. dissenting zoltek i

on remand the cfc granted zolteks request for leave to amend its complaint to substitute as defendant lockheed martin the general_contractor for the f-22_fighter and then granted zolteks motion to transfer the count relating to the f-22_fighter to the united_states district court for the northern district of georgia where it was` reasonably plausible' that the court had jurisdiction over an infringement suit against lockheed
zoltek_corporation v. united_states 85_fed.cl._409 422 2009
on lockheeds motion this aspect was certified for appeal

the federal_circuit then acted en banc in part and reversed its ruling in zoltek i
this court recognized the liability of the united_states for infringement by acts that are performed with its authorization and consent
28 u.s.c.¡± 1498 a` whenever an invention described in and covered by a patent of the united_states is used or manufactured by or for the united_states without license of the owner thereof or lawful right to use or manufacture the same the owners remedy shall be by action against the united_states in the united_states_court of federal_claims for the recovery of his reasonable and entire compensation for such use and manufacture`
by statute the contractor is immunized from liability
id
(` use or manufacture.. by a contractor.. shall be construed as use or manufacture for the united_states'
this court dismissed lockheed as a party negated the proposed transfer to georgia and remanded to the court of federal_claims for inclusion of counts for infringement with respect to both the f-22_fighter and the b-2_bomber
zoltek_corporation v. united_states 672_f.3d_1309 1311 fed.cir.2012 en banc zoltek ii

on remand the cfc separated trial of the issues of validity and infringement and denied discovery as to infringement with respect to the f-22_fighter
zoltek sought mandamus from this court concerning these actions ; the petition was denied
in re zoltek_corporation 526_fed.appx._956 957 fed.cir.2013 non-precedential
trial proceeded in the cfc limited to validity
the government challenged the ¡¬162_patent under sections 101 103 and 112 of title 35
the cfc sustained patent eligibility under section 101 ; that ruling is not appealed

at trial each side presented an expert witness dr. brian sullivan for the government and mr. zsolt rumy for zoltek
the *1305 cfc held the asserted claims invalid on the grounds of obviousness and inadequate written description
zoltek_corporation v. united_states no._96-166 c 2014_wl_1279152_(fed.cl._mar._31,_2014)` cfc op`
zoltek appeals arguing that the cfc applied incorrect laws of written description and obviousness that the cfc did not apply the appropriate burdens and standards of proof and that the cfc erred in its conclusions

zoltek also argues that the issues were improperly bifurcated
we conclude that in the circumstances of this case taking note of the governments official invocation of state secret privilege the cfc acted within its discretion in limiting trial initially to the issues of validity
however as we next discuss we conclude that the trial court erred in its judgment of patent invalidity

the boyd invention
the ¡¬162_patent is directed to a method of manufacturing carbon_fiber_sheet_products whose electrical_resistivity is pre-selected and value-controlled by the described method
this method is based on boyds discovery of a non-linear relationship among the heat treatment conditions partial_carbonization and surface_resistivity1 of sheet_products

the method as claimed in the reissue_patent starts with a previously oxidized and stabilized carbonizable_fiber a product known in the prior_art and commercially available
this oxidized fiber is then partially carbonized in accordance with the relationship discovered by boyd to produce a partially carbonized fiber whose sheet_products have the desired pre-selected surface electrical resistance

this method permits production of carbonized sheets of pre-selected and uniform electrical resistance and thus uniform pre-selected insulating properties
the ¡¬162_specification states that theretofore carbon_fiber_sheets having specified surface electrical resistance were available only by including other materials such as glass or aluminum filaments with the carbonized fibers
¡¬162_patent col. 1 ll.49-60

patent figure 4 shows the foundation discovery of resistivity as a function of carbonizing temperature

?
*1306 the lower curve represents the volume_resistivity for single fibers at the carbonizing temperature and upper curves a and b show surface resistivities for one half ounce per square yard and one ounce per square yard sheet_products incorporating the designated partially carbonized fibers
the patent describes and exemplifies the preparation of fibers having the preselected partial_carbonization and the production of sheet_products having the desired electrical_properties
id. col.4 ll.19-23` [ t ] he temperature-resistivity of the single carbonized fiber is translated into the preselected desired surface resistance of the resultant partially carbonized fiber sheet product produced with such fibers
``

it is not disputed that the non-linear relationship shown in figure 4 and its application to achieve the results described in the ¡¬162_patent were not previously known
the governments expert dr._sullivan stated to be one of the nations preeminent experts with a` thirty-year career in research and design relating to carbon fiber science' u.s. br
22 testified that his calculations pertaining to his reproduction of the figure 4 curve were based on data that were not in the prior_art and were selected retrospectively
no reference showed the relationship between volume or surface-resistivity of carbon_fiber_sheet_products and treatment_temperature of carbon_fibers

the cfc held claims 1-big_token__22_and_33__big_token -38 of the reissue_patent invalid on two grounds 1 that they did not meet the written description_requirement and 2 that the claimed invention would have been obvious to a person of ordinary_skill in this field at the time of the invention

i
written description
the claimed method is summarized in reissue_claim 1 shown as in the reissue_patent with deletions from the original claim in brackets and additions in italics-for these changes are the basis of the cfcs ruling of invalidity on the ground of inadequate written description 1
a method of manufacturing a plurality of different_value controlled resistivity carbon_fiber_sheet_products employing a carbonizable_fiber starting *1307 material ; said method comprising [ oxidizing and stabilizing the carbonizable_fiber starting_material at an elevated temperature of the order of 220 degrees_centigrade to effect molecular aromatic rearrangement of the fibers ] selectively partially carbonizing [ the ] previously oxidized and stabilized fiber starting_material for a predetermined_period in an oxygen free atmosphere within a furnace at [ a ] selected temperature values within a temperature_range from 370 degrees_centigrade to about 1300 degrees_centigrade by soaking the stabilized fiber starting_material at the selected temperature for the predetermined_period of time to provide a [ desired ] preselected known volume electrical_resistivity to the partially carbonized fibers corresponding to that volume electrical_resistivity value required to provide the preselected desired surface resistance value for the finished sheet_products and thereafter processing the partially carbonized fibers into [ desired electrical_resistivity ] homogeneous carbon_fiber_sheet_products [ having the form of non-woven paper or woven or knitted fabric sheet_products ] having the preselected desired surface electrical [ resistivities ] resistances

the cfc held that the original_patent did` not support the elimination of the oxidation and stabilization step' from the reissued claims and that this rendered the claims` invalid for lack of written description'
cfc_op.at *20-21
the cfc explained that the reissue` impermissibly broadens the patented process by reducing the number of steps required for infringement'
id.at *21
the cfc stated that` although the step is found in the reissue_patent its elimination from the claimed process goes beyond the written description of the invention in the original ¡¬395_patent'
id.at n. 10 emphasis in original

the elimination of the preparation of the starting_material broadened the reissue
however a broadening reissue is not improper if filed within two years of issuance
a patentee is entitled to a reissue` enlarging the scope of the claims' when as here the reissue application is filed` within two years from the grant of the original_patent'
35 u.s.c.¡± 251 d

the cfc also held that the broadened claim is not supported in the specification holding that it is irrelevant that the omitted oxidizing and stabilizing step is fully described in the specification as well as being in the prior_art
the cfc held that the preparation of the known starting_material must be included in the claim that it is insufficient that the reissue_claim requires that these steps be performed and that whether these steps were known to the prior_art is` irrelevant to the question of whether the written description_requirement is satisfied'
cfc_op.at *19

there was no argument as to insufficiency of either the prior_art or the content of the specification in describing the starting_material
there was no allegation that a person of ordinary_skill in this field would not understand the description in the specification
the original specification plainly and without dispute describes that the starting_material is an oxidized and stabilized fiber cites references showing this known material and describes its preparation
that a previously oxidized and stabilized starting_material was known to a person of ordinary_skill in the field was recognized by the reissue_examiner in his statement that ex [ amine ] r agreed with applicant that partial oxidation & heat stabilization temp
need not be recited in the claims since this temp
is within the prior_art & *1308 claims do not have to recite what is well known in the prior_art
examiner interview summary reissue application no._07 /483,531 may_5,_1992

the cfc had previously construed the reissue_claims as supported by the specification finding that the reissue_claims were substantially the same as in the parent_patent and properly supported
the court stated [ i ] t can hardly be said that the oxidizing and stabilizing step was removed from reissue ¡¬162
on the contrary when the step was removed the examiner rejected the application until zoltek added` previously' in the claims to refer back to this description of the method which requires it unless a previously oxidized and stabilized material is purchased
opinion on defendants motion for partial summary judgment on matters relating to reissue filed on january 15 1999 no._96-166 c fed.cl
sept._13,_1999 unpublished

the government argues that the asserted claims are not supported in the specification because the specification does not state that these steps need not be performed by the same entity
the question of who performs steps of a fully described invention including preparation of a known starting_material is not a matter of the written description_requirement

the purpose of the written description_requirement is to assure that the public receives sufficient knowledge of the patented technology and to demonstrate that the patentee is in possession of the invention claimed
see in re skvorecz 580_f.3d_1262 1269 fed.cir.2009
the requirement is applied in the context of the state of knowledge at the time of the invention
capon v. eshhar 418_f.3d_1349 1358 fed.cir.2005
the written description` need not include information that is already known and available to the experienced public'
space sys./loral inc. v. lockheed martin corp. 405_f.3d_985 987 fed.cir.2005 ; see enzo biochem inc. v. gen-probe inc. 323_f.3d_956 970 fed.cir.2002` [ the written ] description is the quid pro quo of the patent system ; the public must receive meaningful disclosure in exchange for being excluded from practicing the invention for a limited period of time
``

here the ¡¬162_specification describes the preparation of the starting_material and states that it is commercially available
¡¬162_patent col.4 ll.45-55` [ t ] he carbonizable tow is supplied to an oxidation operation 14 where it is stabilized by being heated in atmospheric oxygen to a temperature of about 220 degrees_centigrade..
the resulting oxidized tow is sold under the trademarkpyron
``
the government does not argue that a person of ordinary_skill would not be able to make or acquire the starting_material based on the description in the specification

the written description_requirement relates to whether the patentee possessed the invention that is claimed
there was no suggestion that a person of ordinary_skill would not have understood that boyd was in possession of the invention that he claimed
see centocor ortho biotech inc. v. abbott labs. 636_f.3d_1341 1348 fed.cir.2011` to satisfy the written description_requirement the applicant must convey with reasonable clarity to those skilled in the art that as of the filing_date sought he or she was in possession of the invention and demonstrate that by disclosure in the specification of the patent'
( internal_quotation_marks omitted ; see also alcon research ltd. v. barr labs. inc. 745_f.3d_1180 1191-92 fed.cir.2014` critically barr adduced no evidence let alone clear and convincing_evidence that was probative *1309 of whether an ordinarily skilled artisan would not have understood from the disclosures of alcons.. patents that the patentees invented or possessed the methods of the asserted claims
without that evidence there was no basis on which to find a lack of adequate written description
``

the cfc stated its concern that the reissue_patent claims could be infringed by an entity that did not itself make the starting_material but purchased the known starting_material from a commercial source
however the reissue statute provides that reissue is available` by reason of the patentee claiming more or less than he had a right to claim.. for the invention disclosed in the original_patent'
35 u.s.c.¡± 251 a
a validly obtained reissue does not violate the written description_requirement if the patentee can reach an enlarged scope of possible infringement

it is not an improper broadening amendment when a reissue applicant with the considered agreement of the reissue_examiner substitutes a preparatory_step known to those skilled in the art at the time of the invention with a requirement to start with the product of that known preparatory_step
the cfcs emphasis on who might infringe the broadened reissue_claims is an issue of infringement not written description

we conclude that the cfc erred in holding reissue_claims 1-big_token__22_and_33__big_token -38 invalid for failure to meet the written description_requirement of section 112
that ruling is reversed

ii
obviousness
the science of carbonized fiber materials had been the subject of study well before the boyd patent application was filed as exemplified in the references cited during patent_prosecution and in these proceedings

the cfc relied on the governments expert dr._sullivan who cited references concerning carbon fiber products and developed a mathematical_formula from which he generated a graph duplicating that in figure 4 of the ¡¬162_patent
to produce this graph dr._sullivan used data from the ¡¬162_patent record from a zoltek publication issued in 2000 and various references and articles
he cited

[ 1 ] akio shindo studies on graphite fiber government industrial research institute of osaka 1961 is a research report discusses the manufacture and use of carbon_fibers of polyacrylonitrile
shindo states that increasing heat-treatment_temperature of the fiber results in increased conductivity of the fiber
shindo does not show or suggest the non-linear relationship between temperature and resistivity that was discovered by boyd or the use of such_relationship to control surface_resistivity

[ 2 ] kitago u.s. patent no._3998,689 dec._21,_1976 describes the production of carbon_fiber_sheets by a process that combines chopped carbon_fibers with other ingredients to form a slurry which is shaped into a sheet saturated with a resin and then carbonized to form a conductive sheet product
kitago provides data for sheets carbonized at 1000¢Xc and 2000¢Xc showing significantly lower resistivity at the higher temperature
kitago does not show or suggest the non-linear relationship discovered by boyd or the use of such_relationship to control surface_resistivity

[ 3 ] layden u.s._patent_no._4080,413 mar._21,_1978 shows carbonization of chopped polyacrylonitrile fiber sheets over the range of 1000¢Xc to 1260¢Xc to produce hard inflexible products with extremely *1310 low surface resistivities suitable for use as fuel cell electrodes
layden does not show or suggest the non-linear relationship discovered by boyd or the use of such_relationship to control surface_resistivity

[ 4 ] topchjiev u.k. patent no._979122 jan._1,_1965 entitled` method of producing semiconductive polymer materials' uses oxidized and stabilized carbon_fibers that are heat treated to produce materials with semiconductor properties electrical conductivity
topchjiev does not show or suggest the non-linear relationship discovered by boyd or the use of such_relationship to control surface_resistivity

[ 5 ] d.b
fischbach & kunio komaki electrical resistance of carbon fibers university of washington 1979 is an article that explains that increasing the treatment_temperature results in decreased volume_resistivity
this article does not show or suggest the non-linear relationship discovered by boyd or the use of such_relationship to control surface_resistivity

these references variously show the heat treatment of carbonized fibers and their resistivities or conductivities at various treatment_temperatures
on cross-examination dr._sullivan agreed that these references alone do not establish obviousness
the following exchange took place q
and the fischbach and komaki article.. the topchjiev_patent.. the layden_patent.. all disclose nothing more than what was disclosed in the otani reference before the patent office correct ?
a. i believe that is correct yes
q
and i believe its also your testimony-prior testimony that the topchjiev_patent and the layden_patent by themselves would not be sufficient to render the zoltek patent obvious correct ?
a
yes i think that is correct
trial tr
269:5-15

instead dr._sullivan relied on a mathematical_formula he derived from the rule of mixtures,2 citing several articles viz.` theory of reinforced materials' by z._hashin 1972` analysis of composite_materials-a survey' by z._hashin 1981` an analysis model for spatially oriented fiber composites' by b.w
rosen et al
( 1977 and` mechanics of composite_materials' by r. christensen 1979
the position of dr._sullivan was summarized at trial as follows

q. so to sum up your testimony dr._sullivan youre asserting that it would be obvious to a person of ordinary_skill in the art as of october 1984 to rely upon four publications which do not mention surface_resistivity partially carbonized or semi-conductive carbon_fibers or the method to control the surface_resistivity of carbon_fiber_sheet_products made from the-made from the partially carbonized fibers and controlling the volume_resistivity of the partially carbonized fiber the 1972 hashin and the 1977 rosen articles referring to structural fibers that it would have been obvious to a person of ordinary_skill in the art as of october of 1984 to construct the mathematical methodology you described on your direct examination to obtain carbon_fiber_sheet_products having a controlled surface_resistivity ?
[ objection ] the court.. do you want the question broken out or- *1311 the witness no because that is my testimony
trial tr
245:12-246:8
no reference mentions` surface_resistivity' or` the required limitation to pre-select individual fiber volume resistivities to produce sheet_products with desired surface resistivities'
zoltek_br
4-5 citing record
dr._sullivan testified that he was not aware of anyone including himself who had previously used the mathematical_formula he created to determine carbonization temperature-resistivity relationships

the ¡¬162_patent teaches carbonized sheets that` require no insulating elements such as glass fiber in order to adjust the surface resistances of the sheet product to a desired surface resistance volume'
t62 patent col.2 ll.7-11
the novelty of such sheets was not disputed
the patent_prosecution and trial records contain a letter from george_rodgers a materials engineer at northrop grumman the general_contractor for the b-2_bomber who stated in december 1983 the material & processes department of northrop advanced systems division ordered four rolls of carbon fiber paper from stackpole fibers co
the product was unique in that the carbon_fibers were not fully carbonized increasing the volume_resistivity of the fiber which in turn increases the surface_resistivity of the paper.. at the time the order was placed northrop_materials & processes had never seen a material of this type before and was not aware of any other_company that could supply material in this form with varying electrical_properties
letter from george_rodgers dated august 6 1987 prosecution file wrapper 187
by deposition on august 18 2009 mr. rodgers testified that with regard to the accuracy of the contents of that letter viewed in hindsight` i would n't change anything'
rogers dep
34:6

dr._sullivan also testified that he had no basis to disagree with the rodgers letter
specifically he testified q
okay
and the last sentence reads` at the time the order was placed northrop_materials & processes had never seen a material of this type and were not aware of any other_company that could supply material in this form with varying electrical_properties'
do you see that ?
a. i do
q
okay
and you have no basis to disagree with that statement do you ?
a
no i do n't
trial tr
274:16-25

there is no teaching or suggestion in the prior_art to select the data that sullivan selected and to plug the selected data into the mathematical_equation that sullivan devised
as summarized by zoltek` sullivan used the variable fiber volume resistivities shown [ in ] the file history of the ¡¬395 parent_patent at various temperatures and constant volume resistivities for each remaining component of the sheet_products in making his calculations'
zoltek_br
23 citing record
this is not evidence of obviousness
see ewp corp. v. reliance universal inc. 755_f.2d_898 907 fed.cir.1985` patentability under the statute ¡± 103 is a decision made on the basis of a hypothesis would the invention have been obviousto a person having ordinary_skill in the art to which the subject matter pertains in the light of all knowledge conveyed byprior_art as defined by statute and case law
``

zoltek also points to several errors made by dr._sullivan to which sullivan admitted on cross-examination
zoltek mentions` sullivans erroneous fiber volume_fraction 0.3 fiber density 1.81 g/cm3 *1312 and resin volume_fraction 0.54'
zoltek_br
24 n.5
with respect to dr._sullivans testimony that he used a volume_fraction of 0.3 in his rule of mixtures calculation purportedly reflective of the zoltek patented product zolteks expert mr. rumy testified in the paper process you ca n't even make that kind of conduct-that kind of concentration of carbon_fibers only possibly by taking a regular paper product that is made probably no more than 10_to_15 percent carbon content and then you compress it
but we-that's-that would be destroying our entire invention
trial tr
326:22-327:2

as another error while the rule of mixtures requires the use of volume_fractions of each component of a composite mixture dr._sullivan used a weight percent for each component in order to place data_points on the figure 4 template
see zoltek_br
28

these errors taint dr._sullivans reproduction of figure 4
indeed dr._sullivan made several confessions of error in his selection or calculation of data_points to produce the graph he created to track figure 4
as another example q..
so youve inserted a uniform density of 1.81 grams per cubic centimeter which is the density of fully carbonized fibers when there should have been a gradually increasing density from 1.36 through the temperature_range shown on [ your spreadsheet ] correct ?
[ objection for lack of foundation ; overruled ] a
it is true that the carbon fiber density will change with heat treatment_temperature and that it probably is true that a different_value other than a uniform 1.81 would have been more appropriate
q
okay
a. i will concede that
trial tr
257:2-19

zoltek also points to dr._sullivans admission that his critical fiber volume_fraction 0.3 % /30 % fundamental to his calculations based on the rule of mixtures was wrong and that dr._sullivan used data from a 2000 zoltek users guide directed to fully carbonized composites at a temperature of 1400¢Xc a reference published fourteen years after the ¡¬162_patents filing_date

dr._sullivan conceded that there were errors in his calculations stating that the reason was that he did not have complete_information
that is not surprising for there was not complete_information in the prior_art-weighing against the governments argument that it would have been obvious to a person of ordinary_skill to recreate the boyd graph from known information
dr._sullivans plaint that he could not accurately duplicate boyds discovery because of lack of information is powerful evidence of non-obviousness-not the contrary

dr._sullivan stated that he obtained some of the values he used in his calculations from the ¡¬162_patent itself
however for the volume_fraction of carbon fiber described by dr._sullivan as by far the most important element in the equation he ignored the figure in the patent 0.83 and used a value of 0.3 which he testified came from a zoltek 2000 users guide
zoltek points out that this guide was directed to an entirely different product and also that the guide was written fourteen years after the ¡¬162_patent application was filed
there was no showing that the information on which dr._sullivan relied was available to persons of skill at the time of the boyd invention
zoltek states and dr._sullivan did not contradict that dr._sullivan selected *1313 values from various sources in order to fit the template of boyds results

neither the governments attorney argument nor dr._sullivans testimony nor the opinion of the court of federal_claims points to any suggestion in the prior_art to select the data selected by dr._sullivan and create the mathematical_formula to construct a graph to track figure 4
see ksr int l co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 418-19 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007)` although common sense directs one to look with care at a patent application that claims as innovation the combination of two known devices according to their established functions it can be important to identify a reason that would have prompted a person of ordinary_skill in the relevant field to combine the elements in the way the claimed new invention does
this is so because inventions in most if not all instances rely upon building blocks long since uncovered and claimed discoveries almost of necessity will be combinations of what in some sense is already known
``

even dr._sullivan called his reconstruction of figure 4` somewhat arbitrary'
trial tr
259:18
hindsight reconstruction for litigation ends is not of probative value
see outside the box innovations llc v. travel caddy inc. 695_f.3d_1285 1298 fed.cir.2012` precedent recognizes the pitfalls of judicial hindsight exercised at the time of litigation..'

the court has recognized` the distortion caused by hindsight_bias' and` arguments reliant upon ex post_reasoning' in determining obviousness
ksr 550 u.s. at 421 127_s.ct._1727 ; see intouch technologies inc. v. vgo commc'ns inc. 751_f.3d_1327 1351 fed.cir.2014` it appears that [ the expert ] relied on the.. patent itself as her roadmap for putting what she referred to as pieces of a jigsaw puzzle together
`` ; w.l
gore & associates inc. v. garlock inc. 721_f.2d_1540 1553 fed.cir.1983` to imbue one of ordinary_skill in the art with knowledge of the invention in suit when no prior_art reference or references of record convey or suggest that knowledge is to fall victim to the insidious effect of a hindsight syndrome wherein that which only the inventor taught is used against its teacher
``

the government does not attempt to rehabilitate dr._sullivans errors
instead the governments argument appears to be that since dr._sullivan is a renowned scientist in this held and since dr._sullivan was able to reproduce the figure 4 graph it was obvious to do so
this was error since as we have repeatedly cautioned` [ t ] hat which may be made clear and thusobvious to a court with the invention fully diagrammed and aided.. by experts in the held may have been a break-through of substantial dimension when first unveiled'
