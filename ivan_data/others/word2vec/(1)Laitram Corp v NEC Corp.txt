opinion
pauline newman circuit_judge
in a suit for patent infringement filed by the laitram_corporation against nec corporation nec_information_systems inc. and sears roebuck and company collectively` nec' the grant of partial_summary_judgment in favor of nec was certified for immediate appeal.1

the question raised is whether amendments made to patent claims during reexamination of the patent are substantive as a matter of law when the amendments are made following a rejection based on prior_art
we conclude that there is no per se rule
it must be determined whether the claims are substantively changed on consideration of the facts of the case

accordingly the grant of partial_summary_judgment is reversed
the case is remanded for further_proceedings

background
united states patent no._3952,311 the311_patent entitled` electro-optical printing system' inventor james m. lapeyre was issued on april_20,_1976 and is assigned to the laitram_corporation
the patent is directed to high_speed electro-optical printing whereby printed characters are produced on a sheet of radiation_sensitive_material
as described in the specification radiation emitting elements are arrayed in a straight_line and the radiation_sensitive_material is moved past the emitter_array at constant_speed in a direction perpendicular to the line of the array
as the radiation_sensitive_material moves past the array certain of the emitters are activated so as to produce type_quality_alpha-numeric_characters

a request for reexamination was filed by a third party not involved in this suit
the patent examiner determined that the request raised a substantial_new_question of patentability2 as to claims 1_and_2 the only claims of the original311_patent
during the ensuing reexamination the examiner rejected claims 1_and_2 on the ground of obviousness 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 in view of certain newly cited references
claim 2 was also rejected as anticipated 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b by one of the newly cited references

laitram filed a response in which it amended claims 1_and_2 and added new_claims 3_through_27 containing additional limitations
claims 1_and_2 follow wherein the words added during reexamination are *1359 italicized and the words deleted are shown in brackets 1
an electro-optical_printing_apparatus for printing type_quality_alpha-numeric_characters at high_speed on a surface of a photosensitive recording_material said apparatus comprising a plurality of rapidly reacting radiation_emitters each being capable of emitting radiation at wavelengths to which said surface is sensitive said emitters being disposed in an array along a substantially straight_line said array being a plurality of rows of said radiation_emitters ; means for moving said recording_material in a single_direction substantially perpendicular to said straight_line with its surface adjacent said array and at a substantially constant_speed relative to said array and ; means for selectively activating each of said emitters for predetermined_periods of time and
means for coordinating the predetermined period of time in which each of the said plurality of emitters are activated with said constant relative speed of said recording_material so that the radiation emitted by said emitters will be recorded on selected areas of said recording surface in the form of an alpha-numeric image each of said emitters being positioned to irradiate a different_area of said recording surface the different_areas of said surface irradiated by each of the said emitters being arranged in an overlapping relationship with one another and said plurality of emitters being of sufficient number to print said type_quality_alpha-numeric_characters
2
a method of electro-optically printing type_quality_alpha-numeric_characters at high_speed on the recording surface of a photosensitive_material said method comprising the steps of arranging a plurality of rapidly reacting radiation_emitters in a straight_line array each of the said emitters being capable of emitting radiation at wave- lengths to which said photosensitive_material is sensitive selectively energizing for predetermined_periods of time each of the said emitters transmitting the emitted radiation from each of the said emitters to a different_area on said surface providing relative_movement along a single coordinate substantially perpendicular to said array at substantially constant_speed between said recording surface and said emitters and
coordinating the predetermined_periods of time in which each of said plurality of emitters [ are ] is selectively energized with said constant_speed of said relative_movement between said emitters and recording surface so that alpha-numeric_character_images are recorded on said recording by exposure of said selected [ ares ] areas of said recording surface by said emitted radiation said step of coordinating including the steps of synchronously generating a first data signal which programs the order [ to ] of energization of said emitters and a second data signal which determines the duration of the energization period of said emitters and employing said first and second data signals to effect energization of said emitters so as to record said alpha-numeric_character_images of said type_quality at said high_speed
laitram filed a detailed analysis of each of claims 1_through_27 in light of the newly cited references pointing out how the teachings of the references differed from the311 invention
for example laitram explained that the movement of the paper as shown in the newly cited baylis reference was in more than one direction relative to the emitter_array whereas the311 specification made clear that the movement of the paper in the claimed invention was along a single perpendicular coordinate
laitram presented additional arguments as to perceived deficiencies in other references

*1360 the examiner allowed claims 1_and_2 as amended and claims 3_through_27 as added giving the following reason the prior_art fails to teach an electro-optical_printing_apparatus for printing type_quality characters including a plurality of emitters disposed in an array along a substantially straight_line [ ] a recording surface moved in a single_direction at a substantially constant_speed in a direction substantially perpendicular to the line of the emitter_array [ ] and means for selectively coordinating the activation of the emitters for predetermined_periods of time in combination with the other elements recited in the claims

laitram argued to the district_court that the amendment of claims 1_and_2 to include the added words was done to` more particularly define' the invention that the added words stated inherent details and did not change the scope of the claims
the district_court did not decide the question of whether the changes to claims 1_and_2 were in fact substantive or discuss the scope of these claims before and after amendment
the court ruled summarily that any amendment to overcome a rejection on prior_art is substantive as a matter of law

the certified question
reexamination provides a mechanism for enabling the patent and trademark office to review and correct an initial examination.3 thus reexamination is conducted afresh without the burdens and presumptions that accompany litigation of an issued patent

the commissioner having determined that a substantial_new_question of patentability is raised may order reexamination of the patent 35 u.s.c.¡± 304 and conduct reexamination proceedings using the same procedures as in initial examination 35 u.s.c.¡± 305

the issue certified on this appeal requires determination of whether as a matter of law a claim is deemed substantively changed when it is amended on reexamination following a rejection based on prior_art
recovery of damages for an asserted infringement during the period between the date of issuance of the original_patent and the date of issuance of the reexamined_patent requires that the original and reexamined_claims be` identical'4 whether claims are` identical' when some of the words are changed has received substantial attention in this courts precedent

in seattle box co. v. industrial crating & packing inc. 731_f.2d_818 827-28 221_uspq_568 575 fed.cir.1984 this court held that the word` identical' in ¡± 252` means at mostwithout substantive_change` emphasis in original
in seattle box the court applied that definition to the reissued claim and concluded that the limitation` substantially equal to or greater than' was a substantive_change from the limitation` greater than' in the *1361 original_claim
the court observed that this change was` not a matter of a mere_clarification of language to make specific what was always implicit or inherent'
id.at 828 221 uspq at 575

`` identical' does not mean verbatim
in kaufman co. v. lantech inc. 807_f.2d_970 1_uspq2d_1202_(fed.cir.1986) the court rejected the argument that any amendment to the claims during reexamination is substantive
referring to the legislative history of reexamination the court remarked that no more rigorous standard was intended for reexamined_claims than for reissued claims wherein precedent had established that` identical' in ¡± 252 means without substantive_change in the scope of the claims
id.at 978 1 uspq2d at 1208
the court determined that the claim_changes merely clarified the invention without substantive_change in the meaning or scope of the claim

in slimfold manufacturing co. v. kinkead industries inc. 810_f.2d_1113 1_uspq2d_1563_(fed.cir.1987) the court construing an amendment made following a rejection based on 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 remarked that` [ c ] laims are not interpreted in a vacuum but are part of and are read in light of the specification'
id.at 1116 1 uspq2d at 1566
the court stated that the standard applied is that of whether a particular change to the claims is substantive such that the scope of the claims is no longer substantially identical
it is a reasonable standard for it implements the purpose of the statute while enabling application` to the facts in any given case that justice will be done'

again in tennant co. v. hako minuteman inc. 878_f.2d_1413 1417 11_uspq2d_1303 1306-07 fed.cir.1989 the court held that a claim made more definite by adding a term from the specification without change in scope is not substantively changed and the claims are` legally identical'

in tillotson ltd. v. walbro corp. 831_f.2d_1033 1036-39 4_uspq2d_1450 1452-54 fed.cir.1987 the court held that the reissue claim could not be automatically construed as broadened by omission of a claim term ; the court held that the claims must be construed in light of the specification prosecution_history prior_art and other_pertinent_information which in that case included extrinsic_evidence of industry practice
the court held that this claim construction raised disputed issues of material_fact such that summary_judgment was improper

nec argues that these rulings should be limited to changes made to overcome rejections under ¡± 112 and that the principles of prosecution_history_estoppel impose a per se restraint when claim_changes are made following rejections on prior_art
precedent does not support such a rule
nec relies on cases where prosecution_history_estoppel limited application of the doctrine of equivalents inter alia diversitech corp. v. century steps inc. 850_f.2d_675 681 7_uspq2d_1315 1320 fed.cir.1988 ; townsend engineering co. v. hitech co. ltd. 829_f.2d_1086 1091 4_uspq2d_1136 1140 fed.cir.1987 ; and mannesmann demag corp. v. engineered metal products co. 793_f.2d_1279 1285 230_uspq_45 49 fed.cir.1986
none of the cases cited supports the per se rule urged by nec for each was decided on its facts taking into account relevant evidence of the specification prosecution_history prior_art and any other pertinent circumstances

a rejection on prior_art during the course of reexamination is not of course a pto decision of unpatentability ; it is part of the prosecution_history and its significance depends on the particular_facts and circumstances
the reasons for a change in claim language must be considered in determining its estoppel effect

`` ; *1362 hi-life_products inc. v. american national water-mattress corp. 842_f.2d_323 325 6_uspq2d_1132 1134 fed.cir.1988` a close examination must be made as to not only what was surrendered but also the reason for such a surrender` quoting bayer aktiengesellschaft v. duphar international research b.v. 738_f.2d_1237 1243 222_uspq_649 653 fed.cir.1984 ; hughes aircraft co. v. united states 717_f.2d_1351 1363 219_uspq_473 481 fed.cir.1983 amendment may have` limiting effect within a spectrum ranging from great to small to zero'
determination of the presence and scope of any estoppel due to amendment requires consideration of the particular prior_art involved in the rejection
labounty manufacturing inc. v. united states international trade commission 867_f.2d_1572 1576-77 9_uspq2d_1995 1998-99 fed.cir.1989

in harmony with the courts clear rejection of the proposition that any amendment to a claim acts as a per se estoppel when the issue is the doctrine of equivalents hi-life_products 842 f.2d at 325 6 uspq2d at 1134 we conclude that the proposition of per se estoppel when the issue is substantive_change on reexamination must also be rejected

the district_court relied on scripps_clinic & research_foundation v. genentech inc. 678_f.supp._1429 1433 6_uspq2d_1018 1021 n.d.cal.1988
the district_court in scripps did` consider the circumstances' of the prior_art the specification and the amendments although stating as quoted by the district_court_herein that` [ w ] here the amendment is made to overcome the examiners rejection of claims as unpatentable it is a substantive_change'
scripps supra
this court reversed the district_courts grant of summary_judgment on other grounds and did not discuss this issue

the district_court_herein also relied on an opinion of the international trade commission in in re certain apparatus for flow injection analysis 226_uspq_236_(united_states_int'l_trade_comm.1984) appeal dismissed sub nom
block v. united states int l trade comm. 777_f.2d_1568 228_uspq_37_(fed.cir.1985) vacating the administrative law judges determination that claims of an original and reexamined_patent were` identical'
the commission had held that amendment following a rejection on prior_art` clearly implies a change in coverage i.e. a substantive_change'
226 uspq at 239
the federal_circuit denying interlocutory appeal held that the commissions decision was not a final determination on the merits and stated that the petitioner was not bound by the commissions opinion
block 777 f.2d at 1571-72 228 uspq at 39

nec relies on several cases in which courts had held that claim_changes made on reexamination or reissue were indeed substantive
none of these cases however held that such changes were per se substantive without analysis of their substance
all were based on a review of the merits of the issue
e.g. fortel corp. v. phone-mate inc. 825_f.2d_1577 1581 3_uspq2d_1771 1774 fed.cir.1987 changes were found substantive the court observing that the patentee conceded that reexamined_claims were` slightly broader' than original_claims ; general electric co. v. hoechst celanese corp. 698_f.supp._1181 1185 12_uspq2d_1517 1521 d.del.1988 patentee admitted that change of` comprising' to` consisting essentially of' was a narrowing of the claim the district_court holding that this narrowing to avoid prior_art was a substantive_change ; johnston v. textron inc. 579_f.supp._783 793 222_uspq_160 168 d.r.i.1984 affd 758_f.2d_666_(fed.cir.1984) table district_court found` whole structural concept.. significantly altered' in reissue claims and that the changes were not mere_clarification or inherent or correction of a mistake
these cases and their reasoning do not support the per se rule pressed by nec

we thus answer the certified question as follows when claims are amended during reexamination following a rejection based on prior_art the claims are not deemed substantively changed as a matter of law
there is no per se rule
to determine whether a claim change is substantive it is *1363 necessary to analyze the claims of the original and the reexamined_patents in light of the particular_facts including the prior_art the prosecution_history other claims and any other_pertinent_information

summary judgment
this matter was decided on necs motion for summary_judgment
on such motion the judgment sought shall be rendered when the movant has shown that there exists no genuine issue of material_fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law

the burden of establishing entitlement to summary_judgment is with the movant with due consideration to the burdens and presumptions at trial
h.h
robertson co. v. united steel deck inc. 820_f.2d_384 388 2_uspq2d_1926 1928 fed.cir.1987
when a sufficiently supported motion has been submitted the burden of coming forward with evidence of the presence of a material_factual dispute shifts to the non-movant
scripps_clinic 927 f.2d at 1571 18 uspq2d at 1005
nec argued that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law based on the undisputed fact that amendments were made following prior_art rejections
although this per se rule has not been sustained we review to determine whether there were disputed issues of material_fact to preclude summary_disposition or whether the case could indeed have been decided summarily

laitram stated that the amendments that it made during reexamination of claims 1_and_2 merely made explicit certain details that were inherent in those claims as originally granted
in support laitram submitted the declaration of leroy prohofsky an engineer
this declaration was directed to the factual details of the claim amendments and mr._prohofskys opinion of their significance
for example he pointed to where the specification of the311_patent described the invention as a` high_speed' printer stating that the` specification teaches very specifically that the whole point of the invention is to provide ahigh_speed electro-optical_printing_apparatus which when printing alpha-numeric_characters prints characters oftype quality'
he quoted extensively from the311_patent document

mr._prohofsky made similar averments with respect to the claim amendment of the` type_quality' characters pointing out that this was the quality to which the invention was directed
he showed where in the specification the radiation_emitters were described as designed` particularly for high_speed applications'
with respect to the` single_direction substantially perpendicular' term he stated that the only direction of movement of the radiation_sensitive_material described in the specification was movement` substantially perpendicular' to the line of the emitter_array
he addressed the` means plus function' form of some of the claim clauses and pointed to the corresponding structure described in the specification
mr._prohofsky concluded that a person of ordinary skill would view the` type_quality'` high_speed'` rapidly reacting' and` substantially perpendicular' limitations that were added to claims 1_and_2 during reexamination as inherent limitations in the claims as originally issued and that claims 1_and_2 as reexamined were substantially identical in scope to their original counterparts

the prohofsky declaration was submitted in opposition to necs motion for summary_judgment
nec offered no evidence or expert opinion to contradict that of mr._prohofsky
on motion for summary_judgment the proffer of extrinsic_evidence including testimony on the meaning origins and significance of claim terms should not be ignored
the technology here involves electro-mechanical devices of some complexity
understanding of the311_patent specification and the various cited references may benefit from technological guidance
see moeller v. ionetics inc. 794_f.2d_653 657 229_uspq_992 995 fed.cir.1986` in a patent case involving complex scientific principles it is particularly helpful to see how those skilled in the art would interpret the claim'

*1364 laitram effectively showed that material_factual_premises underlying the interpretation of claims 1_and_2 are in genuine_dispute
a factual dispute is` genuine' if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-movant
anderson 477 u.s. at 248 106 s.ct.at 2510
thus although the interpretation of claims is a question of law when it is necessary to resolve disputed issues of fact in the course of interpreting the claims summary_disposition is improper
continental can co. u.s.a. v. monsanto co. 948_f.2d_1264 1267 20_uspq2d_1746 1749-50 fed.cir.1991 ; tillotson 831 f.2d at 1039 4 uspq2d at 1454 ; howes v. medical components inc. 814_f.2d_638 647 2_uspq2d_1271 1276 fed.cir.1987

the question of substantive_change of the claims was fairly placed at issue
the summary_judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for further_proceedings
