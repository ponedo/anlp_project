after having been decided in light of our en banc decision in festo_corp. v. shoketsu_kinzoku_kogyo_kabushiki_co. ltd. 234_f.3d_558 56_uspq2d_1865_(fed.cir.2000) this case returns to us for reconsideration in light of the supreme_courts decision in festo_corp. v. shoketsu_kinzoku_kogyo_kabushiki_co. ltd. 535_u.s._722 122_s.ct._1831 152_l.ed.2d_944_(2002)
because there was a narrowing amendment and the equivalent at issue was foreseeable at the time of filing we affirm the district_courts judgment
pioneer_magnetics inc. v. micro_linear_corp. no._95- cv-8307 c.d.cal
nov._10,_1998

background
pioneer_magnetics pioneer owns united_states_patent_no._4677,366 the ¡¬ 366 patent directed toward a` unity_power_factor_power_supply'
the patent describes circuitry designed to receive variant levels of input voltage and to emit a constant output voltage thereby providing a steady electrical current source to another circuit

the ¡¬366_patent consists of four claims independent claim 1 and dependent claims 2-4
claim 1 recites in relevant part` in a switched power_supply a rectifier adapted to be connected to the alternating current line ; a boost converter connected to the output of said rectifier.. ; and a control_circuit.. said control_circuit including a voltage error amplifier.. a switching analog_multiplier_circuit.. a current regulator amplifier.. and circuit_means including a pulse-width_modulator..' ¡¬366_patent col._6,_ll._7-38 emphasis added
claim 2 also relevant to the prosecution_history of the ¡¬366_patent recites` the combination defined in claim 1 in which said multiplier is a switching_type and in which said control_circuit includes a timer and ramp_signal_generator for supplying clock_signals to said switching multiplier and ramp_signals to said pulse width_modulator'
id.at col._6,_ll._39-43

pioneers patent attorney keith beecher filed the application that matured into the ¡¬366_patent on may_12,_1986
the application included nine claims claim 1 the only independent claim and claims 2-9
four of these original_claims are relevant to the issue at hand 4
the combination defined in claim 3 in which said control_circuit includes a multiplier.. 5
the combination defined in claim 4 and which includes.. circuit_means.. *1355 6
the combination defined in claim 5 in which said last-named circuit_means includes a pulse width_modulator
7
the combination defined in claim 6 in which said multiplier is a switching_type and in which said control_circuit includes a timer and ramp_signal_generator for supplying clock_signals to said switching multiplier and ramp_signals to said pulse width_modulator

( emphasis added

the examiner rejected original_claims 1-big_token__5_and_8__big_token -big_token__9_under_35__big_token u.s.c.¡± 102 b as anticipated by united_states_patent_no._4437,146 the carpenter_reference
this reference did not disclose a switching multiplier_circuit or a pulse-width_modulator
the examiner then rejected original_claim 6 as indefinite under 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 second paragraph stating that` [ t ] he phrasesaid last-named circuit_means lacks proper antecedent basis in the claims'
claim 7 was dependent upon claim 6 and therefore was rejected on the same basis

pioneer did not dispute the rejection
instead it amended original_claims 1_and_7 and cancelled original_claims 2-6
the amendments to claim 1 imported claims 2-6 and had the relevant substantive effect of changing` circuit_means' in original_claim 5 to` circuit_means including a pulse-width_modulator' and changing the` multiplier' in original_claim 4 to a` switching analog' multiplier_circuit
in the remarks section of its amended application pioneer explained it is believed clear that there is no showing in the cited carpenter patent 4,437,146 of the specific combination set forth in amended claim 1
it is also noted that amended claim 1 represents original_claim 6 in independent_form and that claim 6 has been amended to overcome the objection raised under 35 usc ¡± 112
despite twice stating that amended claim 1 incorporated original_claims 2-6 pioneer offered no explanation for its addition of the` switching analog' limitation not present in original_claims 1-6

as it stated in its remarks pioneer also amended original_claim 7 issued as final claim 2 to depend on amended claim 1 and to specify that the switching multiplier recited in claim 7 be a` pulse-width' type
on january 21 1987 the examiner held a telephone interview with beecher to propose an amendment deleting this` pulse-width' limitation
with this additional amendment the examiner allowed the claims
the patent issued on june_30,_1987

more than eight years later on december 14 1995 pioneer filed suit against micro_linear alleging infringement of the ¡¬366_patent
in motions seeking interpretation of the claims the parties requested the court to identify what equivalents of the` switching multiplier' limitation if any are barred by prosecution_history_estoppel
in support of its motion pioneer offered a declaration by beecher that the reason he added the` switching' limitation to claim 1 was inadvertence
the court concluded that a` non-switching multiplier' is outside the permissible range of equivalents of this limitation because pioneer narrowed claim 1 by adding limitations including the` switching' limitation to meet the objections of the patent and trademark office as to the patentability of the claim in light of prior_art
in response to this ruling the parties stipulated that summary_judgment of non-infringement be deemed granted to micro_linear on the grounds that its accused products do not *1356 literally infringe any of the claims of the ¡¬366_patent and that prosecution_history_estoppel bars pioneer from asserting under the doctrine of equivalents that the accused products infringe claims containing the` switching analog_multiplier_circuit' limitation
the district_court approved the stipulation and entered a final judgment of non-infringement

discussion
we review a district_courts grant of summary_judgment de novo
see vanmoor v. wal-mart stores inc. 201_f.3d_1363 1365 53_uspq2d_1377 1378 fed.cir.2000 citing petrolite corp. v. baker hughes inc. 96_f.3d_1423 1425 40_uspq2d_1201 1203 fed.cir.1996
prosecution history estoppel is a question of law that we review de novo
cybor corp. v. fas techs. inc. 138_f.3d_1448 1459-60 46_uspq2d_1169 1177-78 fed.cir.1998 en banc citations omitted
an accused device that does not literally infringe a claim may still infringe under the doctrine of equivalents if each limitation of the claim is met in the accused device either literally or equivalently
see warner-jenkinson co. v. hilton davis chem co. 520_u.s._17 40 117_s.ct._1040 137_l.ed.2d_146_(1997)
prosecution history estoppel serves to limit the doctrine of equivalents by denying equivalents to a claim limitation whose scope was narrowed during prosecution for reasons related to patentability

to determine whether a claim gives rise to prosecution_history_estoppel we first must determine whether the amendment narrowed the literal_scope of the claim
here there is no dispute that the amendment of claim 1 from a` multiplier' to a` switching analog' multiplier narrowed the literal_scope of the claim

next we examine the reason why the applicant amended a claim
see warner-jenkinson 520 u.s. at 32-33 117_s.ct._1040
the burden is on the patent holder to establish that the reason for the amendment is not one related to patentability
id.at 33 117_s.ct._1040
where no explanation is established a court should presume that the applicant had a substantial_reason related to patentability for the amendment
id

pioneer contends it added the` switching' limitation through sheer inadvertence unmotivated by any of the statutory requirements for a patent
to argue that its addition of the` switching' limitation was obviously in error it relies on 1 the beecher_declaration 2 the portion of its patent application stating that amended claim 1 incorporated claims 2-6 which did not include the switching limitation and 3 its assertion that reading amended claim 1 to include the` switching' limitation would be redundant of amended claim 2

this argument is unpersuasive
first we do not consider the beecher_declaration in determining the reason for the amendment to the claim
only the public record of the patent prosecution the prosecution_history can be a basis for such a reason
otherwise the public notice function of the patent record would be undermined
second the prosecution_history does not show that the reason for the amendment of the term` switching' was inadvertent
although the remarks section of the amendments indicates that pioneer amended claim 1 to state claim 6 in independent_form it is equally possible that pioneer changed the claim intentionally but inadvertently failed to update the remarks
finally claim 2 is not redundant of claim 1 because it includes the additional limitations *1357 of a` timer and ramp_signal_generator..' ¡¬366_patent col._6,_ll._41-43

pioneer further argues that its amendment adding the` switching' limitation to claim 1 was not related to patentability because it was voluntary and was not offered to overcome any rejection on prior_art or otherwise
however the mere fact that an amendment is voluntary does not shield it from prosecution_history_estoppel
amgen inc. v. hoechst marion roussel inc. 314_f.3d_1313 1345 65_uspq2d_1385 1408-09 fed.cir.2003

we therefore conclude that pioneer has failed to meet its burden of establishing a reason unrelated to patentability for its amendment
our own examination of the prosecution_history convinces us that the amendment was made to avoid prior_art the classic basis for the application of prosecution_history_estoppel
see warner-jenkinson 520 u.s. at 30-31 117_s.ct._1040 ; see also sextant avionique s.a. v. analog devices inc. 172_f.3d_817 826 49_uspq2d_1865 1871 fed.cir.1999 citing bai v. l & l wings inc. 160_f.3d_1350 1355 48_uspq2d_1674 1677 fed.cir.1998 substantive changes to a claim that clearly respond to an examiners rejection of that claim as unpatentable over prior_art give rise to prosecution_history_estoppel

the prosecution_history shows that the examiner rejected claims 1-big_token__5_and_8__big_token -9 in light of the carpenter_reference which disclosed a power_supply containing a non-switching multiplier
pioneer amended claim 1 to include a switching analog multiplier which distinguished the ¡¬366 invention over carpenter
therefore the addition of this limitation was made to avoid prior_art

having concluded that the district_court properly determined that there had been a narrowing amendment for a substantial_reason related to patentability we next turn to whether pioneer can overcome the presumption that it has surrendered the equivalent in question
the supreme_court held that the presumption can be overcome if` [ t ] he equivalent [ was ] unforeseeable at the time of the application ; the rationale underlying the amendment [ bears ] no more than a tangential relation to the equivalent in question ; or there [ was ] some other_reason suggesting that the patentee could not reasonably be expected to have described the insubstantial substitute in question'
festo 535 u.s. at 739 122 s.ct.at 1842 152_l.ed.2d_944
as noted the carpenter_reference discloses a non-switching multiplier_circuit
therefore a non-switching circuit was known in the art and would have been foreseeable at the time of the amendment
the amendment was clearly not tangential to the equivalent in question ; the amendment was made to avoid the very prior_art that contained the equivalent
and given the equivalents presence in the prior_art cited against the patentee during prosecution there can be no other_reason the patentee could not have described the substitute in question

therefore pioneer is estopped from arguing that a non-switching multiplier_circuit is equivalent to the switching multiplier_circuit limitation of the claims in the ¡¬366_patent
as the parties have recognized the determination of these issues is dispositive
it is therefore unnecessary to reach the remainder of the issues briefed by the parties

conclusion
accordingly the judgment of the united_states_district_court for the central_district of california is affirmed

affirmed
