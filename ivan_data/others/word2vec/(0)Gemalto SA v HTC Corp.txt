background
the ¡¬317_patent the ¡¬485_patent and the ¡¬727_patent derive priority from the same provisional patent application,1 and share the same named inventors specification and title` using a high level programming language with a microcontroller
`` 2 the patented technology is designed to allow resource-constrained devices including microcontrollers to run software applications or programs written in high_level_programming_languages such as java

before gemaltos invention microprocessor-based personal_computers could run java_applications
at the time of gemaltos invention these computers used processors that required substantial amounts of memory which was located on chips separate from the chip containing the processor referred to as off-chip_memory
however microcontroller-based devices such as integrated circuit_cards or smart_cards had substantially less memory using memory located on the same_chip as the processor
these devices did not require external memory to function but were constrained by the amount of space on the chip or integrated circuit used for memory
at the time of gemaltos invention there were no java implementations for microcontroller-based smart_cards or integrated circuit_cards
due to the disparity between the constraints of the devices and the demands of the applications` [ f ] itting java_technology inside smart_cards was like playing golf in a telephone booth'
joint appendix` j.a'
643 quoting sun microsystems ceo scott mcnealy internal_quotation_marks omitted

according to gemalto its invention enabled resource-constrained devices to run applications written in high_level_programming_languages such as java by minimizing the computing resources that applications consumed during storage and execution
the asserted claims are directed to applications that are converted from a high_level_programming_language into another format that is suitable for resource-constrained computing devices
the application in converted form is stored in the memory of the chip containing the embedded processor that executes the application
however the processor can not run the converted_application directly and requires an interpreter or virtual machine to translate the converted_application into instructions that the processor can execute
the interpreter is also stored in on-chip_memory
this is important because to run a java_application both the application and the interpreter must fit within the constraints of the platform for the purposes of storage and execution

*1367 in october 2010 gemalto sued the defendants for infringement alleging that the defendants smartphones infringe when they run the android operating system and java_applications converted using the android software development kit
the defendants contended that the accused smartphones do not infringe because they are not resource-constrained devices but rather rely on off-chip_memory to run java_applications similar to prior_art personal_computers

before summary_judgment gemalto narrowed the number of asserted claims to the 6 claims asserted on appeal claims 1 4 and 5 of the ¡¬317_patent ; claims 38_and_39 of the ¡¬485_patent ; and claim 3 of the ¡¬727_patent3 these claims recite either an` integrated circuit_card' or a` programmable_device' that includes a processor and a` memory' storing a converted_application and an interpreter
claim 1 of the ¡¬317_patent which is representative of the` integrated circuit_card' claims reads

1
an integrated circuit_card for use with a terminal comprising a communicator configured to communicate with the terminal ; a memory storing an application derived from a program written in a high_level_programming_language_format wherein the application is derived from a program written in a high_level_programming_language_format by first compiling the program into a compiled form and then converting the compiled form into a converted form the converting step including at least one step selected from a group consisting of
recording all jumps and their destinations in the original byte codes ; converting specific byte codes into equivalent generic byte codes or vice-versa ; modifying byte code operands from references using identifying strings to references using unique identifiers ; and
renumbering byte codes in a compiled format to equivalent byte codes in a format suitable for interpretation ; and
an interpreter operable to interpret such an application derived from a program written in a high_level_programming_language_format ; and
a processor coupled to the memory the processor configured to use the interpreter to interpret the application for execution and to use the communicator to communicate with the terminal
¡¬317_patent_col. 19_ll._38 -67
claim 3 of the ¡¬727_patent the only asserted claim directed to a` programmable_device' reads 3
a programmable_device comprising a memory and
a processor ; the memory comprising an interpreter ; and.at least one application loaded in the memory to be interpreted by the interpreter wherein the at least one application is generated by a programming environment comprising a a compiler for compiling application source programs written in high_level_language source code form into a compiled form and
b a converter for post processing the compiled form into a minimized form suitable for interpretation within the *1368 set of resource_constraints by the interpreter
¡¬727_patent_col. 19_ll._29 -43 emphases added
both the integrated circuit_card and programmable_device claims require the recited` memory' to store a converted_application and an interpreter
the asserted programmable_device claim expressly requires the application to be converted` into a minimized form suitable for interpretation within the set of resource_constraints by the interpreter'
¡¬727_patent_col. 19_ll._41 -43
the district_court construed the recited` memory' as` all program_memory' -i.e.` sufficient_memory to run the java_code [ or other high_level_programming_language ] in accordance with the patentees invention'
j.a
26 footnote omitted
in other words the courts construction required all application memory to be stored on the same_chip as the processor
the court construed` resource_constraints' to mean` insufficient_memory to run the compiled_application_source_program in an unconverted_form'
j.a
40-41
the district_court construed` integrated circuit_card' to mean` a card containing a single_semiconductor_substrate [ i.e. a chip ] having a central_processing_unit and all program_memory'
j.a
31
the court construed` programmable_device' as` a single_semiconductor_substrate integrating electronic_circuit_components that includes a central_processing_unit and all program_memory making it suitable for use as an embedded system'
j.a
33

after the court construed the claims the defendants moved for summary_judgment of non-infringement
gemalto did not dispute that the` accused devices do not containall program_memory on a single_semiconductor_substrate because they requireoff chip memory to run the accused.. android applications' j.a
11 but argued that requiring off-chip_memory did not preclude infringement
the court concluded that the accused devices did not literally infringe because applications were stored in off-chip_memory-i.e. on a chip other than the chip containing the processor
the court also rejected gemaltos theory that the accused devices infringed under the doctrine of equivalents when they temporarily loaded program_instructions into on-chip_cache_memory prior to execution
the court concluded that temporary storage in cache_memory was not substantially the same as permanent_memory storage

claim construction
a
`` integrated circuit card' claims
our claim_construction methodology is described in phillips v. awh corp. 415_f.3d_1303 1312-19 fed.cir.2005 en banc
gemalto first challenges the district_courts construction of the` memory' limitation in the integrated circuit_card_claims to require all program_memory on a single_semiconductor_substrate or chip
gemalto does not dispute that an integrated circuit_card is` a card containing a single_semiconductor_substrate having a central_processing_unit and memory' j.a
31 but contends that the card should be able to access applications stored in off-chip_memory i.e. memory located on chips *1369 other than the chip containing the processor
the claim_language does not support gemaltos theory
the claim_language requires a` memory' that stores an` application' and a` processor' that is coupled to the memory
¡¬317_patent_col. 19_ll._42 43 64
the specification demonstrates that the entire purpose of the invention was to enable the application to be stored within the memory on the chip of the integrated circuit_card

integrated circuit_cards such as smart_cards are small portable devices
before gemaltos invention applications for integrated circuit_cards were typically written in low level programming languages to conserve memory
with the expansion of digital networking there was a` need to load new applications on the card..
however typically this [ wa ] s not practical.. using low level languages'
¡¬317_patent_col. 3_ll._47 -48
the purpose of gemaltos invention was to make it possible to load applications written in high_level_languages such as java into the memory of a resource-constrained integrated circuit_card

gemalto does not dispute that integrated circuit_cards are one-chip devices but argues that these cards can access applications stored in external_memory_sources such as other chips in accordance with its invention
the specification however identifies configurations in which a processor runs java_applications stored in off-chip_memory and ascribes them to the prior_art-i.e. microprocessor-based personal_computers
the specification describes` [ c ] onventional platforms that support java' as` microprocessor-based computers' which have` a central_processing_unit that requires certain external components e.g. memory input controls and output controls to function properly'
¡¬317_patent_col. 1_ll._55 -56 ; 62-66

gemaltos invention was not directed to these conventional prior_art platforms for java
instead it focused on resource-constrained computing platforms such as integrated circuit_cards and microcontrollers which were previously unable to run java_applications
`` in contrast to the microprocessor a microcontroller includes a central_processing_unit memory and other functional elements all on a single_semiconductor_substrate or integrated circuit e.g. achip'
¡¬317_patent_col. 2_ll._2 -5
according to the specification the crucial difference between prior_art microprocessor-based computers and microcontroller-based devices is that` [ i ] n a microcontroller the amount of each kind of memory available is constrained by the amount of space on the integrated circuit' ¡¬317_patent_col. 2_ll._14 -16 while` [ a ] microprocessor system.. is not constrained by what will fit on a single integrated circuit device'
id
ll
26-31
the specification demonstrates that external memory storage was a defining feature of prior_art java_technology and that the patented invention was designed to eliminate the need for such external storage
of course` the claims can not be of broader scope than the invention that is set forth in the specification'
on demand mach corp. v. ingram indus. inc. 442_f.3d_1331 1340 fed.cir.2006

gemaltos interpretation of the term` memory' also conflicts with the prosecution_history
during initial prosecution and reexamination of the ¡¬ 317 patent gemalto repeatedly distinguished invalidating prior_art by emphasizing the novelty of squeezing a java_application onto the memory of an integrated circuit_card
initially the united states patent and trademark office` pto' rejected all claims in the ¡¬317_patent as anticipated and obvious in view of u.s. patent no._5923,884` peyret' titled` system and method for loading applications onto a smart card' as *1370 well as other prior_art references
in response the patentee emphasized the novelty of fitting the application onto an integrated circuit_card arguing that` peyret does not deal with a solution of how to squeeze java or another_high_level_language onto a smart_card
`` 4_j.a._1162
the applicant explained that

[ m ] aking it possible to run programs written in a high_level_language on a smart_card was not obvious prior to applicants invention.. to put java or any other_high_level_language on an integrated circuit_card is anything but obvious
at the time of the invention the typical java virtual machine required over 1 mb of memory
any person of ordinary skill would realize that to squeeze such an interpreter into an integrated circuit_card such as a smart_card is anything but an obvious task'
j.a
1164 emphases added
based on the applicants argument the application subsequently issued as the ¡¬317_patent
during reexamination of the ¡¬317_patent the patentee again argued for patentability based on the difficulty of fitting a java_application into the memory of a resource-constrained device
gemalto argued that` providing java_technology onto smart_cards would be very challenging due to the size constraints of smart_cards as contrasted to the minimum requirements of java'
j.a
1199
because java` applications typically compile into files much larger than the pragmatically available space in a smart_card [ ].. the problem of fitting them onto a smart_card would be rather challenging
also the intermediate language interpreter e.g. the jvm would also have to fit on the card'
j.a
1201

in obtaining and sustaining the ¡¬317_patent gemalto emphasized the significance of fitting the application and interpreter onto the memory of an integrated circuit_card
if the card could simply access external_memory_sources there would be no need to` squeeze' the application or its interpreter onto the card
the integrated circuit_card could simply access the application and interpreter from an external memory source without being constrained by the resources available on the integrated circuit_card itself

however gemalto contends that claim_differentiation supports its theory that the integrated circuit_card_claims should be construed to cover off-chip_memory
that contention rests on claim 4 of the ¡¬317_patent which recites` [ t ] he integrated circuit_card of claim 1 wherein at least a portion of the memory is located in the processor'
¡¬317_patent_col. 20_ll._6 -7
according to this theory by requiring a` portion of the memory' to be in the processor claim 4 indicates that some program_memory can be stored on separate chips
but the language of claim 4 only allows some memory to be outside the processor not outside the chip
it implies that the memory recited in other_claims may be located on the same_chip as the processor but not within the processor itself
claim differentiation based on claim 4 only indicates that none of the memory recited in other_claims needs to be located` in the processor' ; it says nothing about the location of the memory with respect to the chip containing the processor
thus claim_differentiation does not support gemaltos argument or overcome the conclusion that the claims require the processor to be` coupled to the memory' id
col. 19_l._64 i.e. on the same_chip storing the application and interpreter *1371 necessary for the integrated circuit_card to run the application

the patentees arguments regarding the` memory' limitation recited in the integrated circuit_card_claims of the ¡¬317_patent apply equally to the` memory' limitation recited in the integrated circuit_card_claims of the ¡¬485_patent
as we held in elkay manufacturing co. v. ebco manufacturing co. 192_f.3d_973 980 fed.cir.1999` [ w ] hen multiple patents derive from the same initial application the prosecution_history regarding a claim_limitation in any patent that has issued applies with equal_force to subsequently issued patents that contain the same claim_limitation'
id
( citing jonsson v. stanley works 903_f.2d_812 817-18 fed.cir.1990 ; see also andersen corp. v. fiber composites llc 474_f.3d_1361 1368-69 fed.cir.2007 construing claim_language based on statements made during prosecution of parent application regarding similar claim_language biovail corp. int l v. andrx pharms. inc. 239_f.3d_1297 1301-02 fed.cir.2001 construing disputed limitation based on statements relating to that limitation during prosecution of a patent deriving priority from the same original application as the patent-in-suit
the ¡¬485_patent is a continuation of the ¡¬317_patent and shares the same title specification and provisional application from which both derive their priority_date
further claim 38 of the ¡¬485_patent describes the memory and the application it stores using identical_language as claim 1 of the ¡¬317_patent
compare ¡¬317_patent_col. 19_ll._42 -49 with ¡¬485_patent col. 23_ll._25 -32
claim 39 depends from claim 38 and incorporates the same memory limitation adding additional limitations only to the process for converting the application before loading it onto the memory

in short we agree with the district_court that the memory recited in the integrated circuit_card_claims should be construed as` all program_memory' which means` sufficient_memory to run the java_code [ i.e. the application and interpreter ] in accordance with the patentees invention'

b
`` programmable device' claims
gemalto also argues that any limitations barring the use of off-chip_memory in an integrated circuit_card are not relevant to claim 3 of the ¡¬727_patent which is directed to a` programmable_device'
gemalto asserts that the term should be construed broadly to mean` a device that can execute a computer program'
appellants br
37
gemalto suggests that its proposed construction reflects the ordinary_meaning of` programmable_device' to one of skill in the art
however the testimony of two of the asserted_patents inventors timothy wilkinson and scott guthery persons skilled in the relevant art confirms that the term had no such meaning
when asked what the meaning of` programmable_device' is one inventor stated` [ i ] t has no meaning'
j.a
1074
the other averred` i do n't remember anybody ever talking about a programmable_device particularly..
sounds like a patent term to me' and agreed that even a punch-card computer could be considered a programmable_device
j.a
985
gemalto does not assert that` programmable_device' has any ordinary_meaning to a skilled practitioner in the field of computer programming let alone the particular construction it proposes

in any event gemaltos central problem is that the limitation is not` programmable_device' but` memory'
claim 3 explicitly requires a device that has` a memory' and` at least one application loaded in the memory'
¡¬727_patent_col. 19_ll._30 34
the meaning of terms appearing in the ¡¬727_patent must be construed in light of the same terms recited in the ¡¬317_patent
all three asserted_patents are directly related *1372 the ¡¬727_patent is a continuation of the ¡¬485_patent which is a continuation of the ¡¬317_patent derive priority from the same provisional application and share the same disputed claim_language
statements made by the applicant concerning the` memory' limitation in the ¡¬317_patents claims therefore apply with equal_force to the` memory' limitation in the ¡¬727_patents claims with the same limitation
elkay 192 f.3d at 980
claim 3 of the ¡¬727_patent uses identical_language to that of claim 65 of the ¡¬317_patent requiring the recited application to be` loaded in the memory to be interpreted by the interpreter' and converted into` a minimized form suitable for interpretation within the set of resource_constraints by the interpreter'
¡¬727_patent_col. 19_ll._30 -43 ; see also ¡¬317_patent_col. 24_ll._51 -64
the claim requires the application to be loaded in the recited memory and processed into a form that allows the application to be interpreted and thus executed within the set of resource_constraints
as construed by the district_court-and not challenged on appeal-those constraints require the device to lack sufficient_memory if the application had not been so converted

here the meaning of` memory' is made even clearer by the language of the programmable_device claim that requires the application loaded in the memory to be converted` into a minimized form suitable for interpretation within the set of resource_constraints by the interpreter'
¡¬727_patent_col. 19_ll._42 -43 emphasis added
gemaltos arguments to the pto during prosecution of the ¡¬ 317 patent directly make clear the meaning of` resource_constraints' recited in claim 3 of the ¡¬727_patent
to obtain the ¡¬317_patent gemalto emphasized that the conversion of the application was necessary because of the resource_constraints on the device on which it was stored
gemalto explained that
appellants recognized the difficulty in operating java or other_high_level_language programs within the limited resources of an integrated circuit_card or other microcontroller
to solve that problem appellants introduced the additional_step of converting the compiled form from a java compiler into a form suitable for interpretation on a specialized interpreter
peyret does not teach or suggest this additional_step
j.a
1174
the prosecution_history of the ¡¬727_patent and those from which it derives priority do not support gemaltos theory that a` programmable_device' can be any type of computer
rather the prosecution_history demonstrates that a programmable_device must have resource_constraints that the patentee argued made squeezing java_applications on them` anything but obvious'
j.a
1176

on appeal gemalto does not challenge the construction of` resource_constraints' as meaning` insufficient_memory to run the compiled_application_source_program in an unconverted_form'
j.a
40-41
while gemalto admits that the device must meet these limitations it does not explain how the broad_construction it proposes would satisfy them
to be consistent with the` resource_constraints' limitation the device must have insufficient_memory to run the application in an unconverted_form
allowing the device to access external off-chip_memory would effectively read this express limitation out of the claim

gemalto contends that the prosecution_history of the ¡¬727_patent supports a broad_construction pointing to a statement by the examiner that` the present claims are merely considered a broader recitation of claims 1-86 of the ¡¬317_patent'
appellant br
34 internal_quotation_marks omitted
in fact the examiner made the exact same statement about the claims as originally drafted-at which point they recited a *1373` smart_card' rather than a` programmable_device'
further the examiner also recognized that the` [ t ] he subject matter claimed in the instant application [ for the ¡¬727_patent ] is fully disclosed in the [ ¡¬317 ] patent and is covered by the [ ¡¬317 ] patent'
j.a
751 ; see also j.a
1183
the ¡¬317_patent expressly discloses prior_art computers-devices capable of executing computer programs-that run java_applications without the claimed invention
the examiners statement standing alone does not support construing` programmable_device' so broadly that it encompasses any device capable of executing program_instructions particularly those within the prior_art as defined by the specification of the ¡¬727_patent and shared by all three asserted_patents

we thus agree with the district_court that the programmable_device of claim 3 of the ¡¬727_patent should be construed as` a single_semiconductor_substrate integrating electronic_circuit_components that includes a central_processing_unit and all program_memory making it suitable for use as an embedded system'
j.a
33

ii
infringement
the district_court granted summary_judgment of non-infringement as to all asserted claims
the court found that the accused devices did not infringe literally because it was undisputed that they` store program_instructions off-chip and access those off-chip instructions to run the accused applications'
j.a
12
because the devices could not literally infringe the court found no indirect_infringement of claim 3 of the ¡¬727_patent
with respect to infringement gemalto does not challenge the courts findings on literal or indirect_infringement under the district_courts construction

instead gemalto argues that the accused devices infringe the asserted claims as construed by the district_court under the doctrine of equivalents
a device that does not literally infringe a claim may infringe under the doctrine of equivalents
energy transp grp. inc. v. william demant holding a/s 697_f.3d_1342 1352 fed.cir.2012

gemalto contends that the accused devices infringe under the doctrine of equivalents when they temporarily load program_instructions from off-chip_memory into on-chip_cache_memory before execution
because cache_memory can not store applications or any content when a device is turned off the court concluded that cache_memory is substantially different from permanent_memory and not equivalent for infringement purposes
gemalto admits that cache_memory does not store program_instructions when the accused devices are turned off but argues that the difference between temporary on-chip_storage and permanent on-chip_storage is insubstantial or alternatively that the significance of this difference raises a genuine question of material fact
gemaltos theory of infringement by equivalents hinges on its contention that on-chip_cache_memory is equivalent to on-chip_memory permanently storing applications
according to gemalto applications are loaded into on-chip_cache_memory before execution 97 % of the time and the difference between 97 % and 100 % is insubstantial

*1374 a plaintiff must provide` particularized_testimony and linking_argument to show the equivalents' are insubstantially different

`` generalized testimony as to the overall_similarity between the claims and the accused infringers product or process will not suffice'
texas_instruments 90 f.3d at 1567

`` id
( quoting pennwalt corp. v. durand-wayland inc. 833_f.2d_931 935 fed.cir.1987 en banc
gemalto has failed to provide particularized_testimony and linking_argument

gemalto provided no testimony asserting that the difference in functionality between cache_memory and permanent_memory is in fact insubstantial
gemaltos expert testimony only addresses the difference between having 100 % or 97 % of program_instructions stored on-chip not the underlying difference between temporary and permanent storage
the testimony does not address whether cache_memory is equivalent to other types of memory that are capable of storing applications after a device is turned off
absent any testimony suggesting that cache_memory is equivalent to permanent_memory no reasonable fact finder could find that the two types of memory function in substantially the same_way to achieve substantially similar results

gemalto asserts that the` invention works the same whether or not the memory is on the same_chip as the cpu or the program is executed from temporary memory'
appellants reply br
30
these arguments are not directed to the equivalence between the accused products functionality and the particular claim_limitation reciting a memory storing an application and interpreter as a whole
rather gemalto offers` merely generalized testimony as to overall_similarity' between the accused products and the claims which under well-established case law` can not support a finding that the differences [ a ] reinsubstantial
`` texas_instruments 90 f.3d at 1568 ; see also aquatex 479 f.3d at 1329` [ t ] he doctrine of equivalents must be applied to individual elements of the invention not the invention as a whole
`` quoting warner-jenkinson 520 u.s. at 29 117_s.ct._1040
establishing infringement under the doctrine of equivalents requires particularized_testimony and linking_argument as the equivalence between the claim_limitation and the alleged equivalent
texas_instruments 90 f.3d at 1567

moreover the cache_memory functionality that is the basis for gemaltos theory was employed by microprocessor-based systems at the time of the invention
gemalto has admitted that`microprocessors in 1996 did have cache_memory` j.a
1852 and that these microprocessors ran java_applications before the 1996 priority_date of the asserted_patents
if cache_memory were equivalent to the recited memory that stores an application and interpreter gemaltos claims would read on microprocessor systems that were widely used prior to its invention
the doctrine of equivalents can not be applied to encompass the prior_art as` this court has consistently limited the doctrine of equivalents to prevent its application to ensnare prior_art'
marquip inc. v. fosber am. inc. 198_f.3d_1363 1367 fed.cir.1999 citing wilson sporting goods v. david geoffrey & assoc. 904_f.2d_677 683 fed.cir.1990
in marquip we recognized *1375 that` [ b ] ecause prior_art limits the exclusive right available to an inventor it also limits the range of permissible equivalents of a claim'
id
applying the doctrine of equivalents to cover cache_memory used in the prior_art is not permissible
we agree with the district_court that the accused devices do not infringe under the doctrine of equivalents due to their use of cache_memory

conclusion
we affirm the district_courts claim_construction and summary_judgment of no infringement with respect to all asserted claims

affirmed

for simplicity all references to the specification are to the ¡¬ 317 patent

gemalto previously asserted 28 claims across the three patents
the 22 claims not asserted on appeal were not before the district_court at summary_judgment

the specification uses the terms integrated circuit_card and smart_card interchangeably
see e.g. ¡¬317_patent_col. 2_ll._37 -38` microcontrollers frequently are used in integrated circuit_cards such as smart_cards'
