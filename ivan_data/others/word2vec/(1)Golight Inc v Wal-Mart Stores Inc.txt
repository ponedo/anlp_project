wal-mart_stores inc.` wal-mart' appeals the decision of the united_states_district_court for the district of colorado after a bench_trial entering a final judgment against wal-mart for infringement of united states patent no._5673,989` the ¡¬989_patent` owned by golight inc.` golight'
golight inc. v. wal-mart_stores inc. 216_f.supp.2d_1175 d.colo.2002

because we find no errors of law by the district_court or any clearly erroneous_findings of fact we affirm

background
the ¡¬989_patent is for a wireless remote-controlled portable_search_light invented by gerald gohl and al gebhardt
the idea for this invention originated from gohls experiences cattle ranching in nebraska where he used hand-held search_lights to locate and assist calving animals in harsh blizzard conditions
gohl determined that it would be advantageous under such conditions to have a portable_search_light that could be mounted on the outside of a vehicle and remotely controlled from either inside or outside the vehicle
together gohl and gebhardt developed and patented the golight which is generally the subject of u.s. patent no._5490,046` the ¡¬046_patent` and then the wireless remote-controlled radio_ray which is generally the subject of the ¡¬989_patent

in 1997 wal-mart through its sams club stores began selling a portable wireless remote-controlled search_light
this search_light was allegedly a low-end copy of the radio_ray being virtually identical in all relevant respects but for the` apparently arbitrary and rather suspicious placement of a plasticstop piece which prevented' the search_light from rotating through 360¢X
id.at 1180
this stop piece restricted the wal-mart search_light to rotating somewhere between 340¢X and 351¢X
counsel for golight sent wal-mart a cease and desist letter on december 11 1998 indicating golights belief that wal-marts device infringed the ¡¬989_patent
golight then filed this lawsuit on february 14 2000
after holding a three-day bench_trial the district_court found that wal-mart infringed claim 11 of the ¡¬989_patent by importing portable_search_lights literally meeting each limitation of the claim the claim was not invalid wal-marts infringement was willful and golight was entitled to damages of $ 464,280 plus its attorney_fees

on appeal wal-mart challenges the district_courts claim_construction and argues that it is entitled to judgment of noninfringement should we adopt its proposed claim_construction
should we affirm the district_courts claim_construction wal-mart concedes infringement but argues that the district_court should have found claim 11 invalid as obvious
wal-mart also challenges the district_courts ruling that any infringement was willful arguing that such a finding is based on clearly erroneous facts and was an abuse of the district_courts discretion
with respect to *1330 damages wal-mart argues that the district_courts selected royalty_rate is unreasonable as a matter of law and is based on factual findings that are clearly erroneous

we have jurisdiction to consider wal-marts appeal under 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

discussion
following a bench_trial we review the district_courts judgment for clearly erroneous_findings of fact and its conclusions of law de novo
allen eng g corp. v. bartell indus. 299_f.3d_1336 1343-44 fed.cir.2002
`` a finding is clearly erroneous when despite some supporting evidencethe reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed

claim construction
claim 11 the only claim of the ¡¬989_patent at issue states as follows in a searchlight_apparatus wherein a lamp_unit is mounted in a housing having vertical_drive_means for tilting said lamp_unit in a vertical_direction and horizontal_drive_means for rotating said lamp_unit in a horizontal_direction the improvement comprising a base_support_member on said housing ; attaching means on said base_support_member for releasably attaching said base_support_member to a substantially flat surface said attaching means including a rubber_boot on said base_support_member and actuating means engageable with said boot for drawing said boot into vacuum-tight_relation to said surface ; and
wireless_remote_control means for controlling vertical and horizontal_movement of said searchlight_apparatus said remote_control means including a self-contained transmitter adapted to be carried by an operator of a motor_vehicle wherein said drive_means can be operated by wireless_transmission both from within said vehicle and at remote_distances from said vehicle without electrical_connection between said drive_means and said remote_control means and having an on/off switch and a four-way_directional_control_switch and a receiver mounted within said housing
'989_patent col._8,_ll._33-55 emphasis added
the only claim_construction dispute in this case is whether the emphasized claim_language implicitly requires the search_light to be capable of rotating through 360¢X
claim 11 has no such explicit limitation unlike the other independent claims of the ¡¬989_patent which recite` horizontal_drive_means for rotating said lamp_unit in a horizontal_direction through at least 360¢X'
see e.g. ¡¬989_patent col._7,_ll._13-14
the district_court concluded that` [ c ] laim 11 does not contain a 360 degree limitation'
golight inc. v. wal-mart_stores inc. no._00- z-331 mjw d.colo
oct._24,_2000
wal-mart disagrees arguing that the written description and prosecution_history compel us to construe the claim as having an implicit 360¢X_limitation

claim construction is a matter of law that we review de novo
markman v. westview instruments inc. 52_f.3d_967 979 fed.cir.1995 en banc affd 517_u.s._370 116_s.ct._1384 134_l.ed.2d_577_(1996)

a. wal-mart first argues that the written description of the ¡¬989_patent requires that claim 11 be construed to include a limitation of rotation through 360¢X
acknowledging that such a limitation does *1331 not expressly appear in claim 11 wal-mart nevertheless contends that the scope of the claims can not exceed what is supported by the written description of the patent ; because the patentees only described a search_light capable of rotation through 360¢X the claims must be so limited
wal-mart also argues that the written description includes specific statements limiting the claimed invention to a device that rotates through 360¢X
in particular wal-mart relies on the statement that
[ a ] searchlight_apparatus in accordance with the present_invention includes a lamp_unit mounted in a housing which has a motor-driven vertical_drive_mechanism for tilting the lamp_unit in a vertical_direction and a motor-driven horizontal_drive_mechanism for rotating the lamp_unit in a horizontal_direction through at least 360¢X
'989_patent col._2,_ll._3-8

`` in construing claims the analytical focus must begin and remain centered on the language of the claims themselves for it is that language that the patentee chose to useto particularly point [ ] out and distinctly claim [ ] the subject matter which the patentee regards as his invention
`` interactive gift express inc. v. compuserve inc. 256_f.3d_1323 1331 fed.cir.2001 quoting 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
2
while claims must be construed in light of the specification markman 52 f.3d at 979 limitations from the specification are not to be read into the claims comark communications inc. v. harris corp. 156_f.3d_1182 1186 fed.cir.1998 for` [ i ] t is the claims that measure the invention' sri_int l v. matsushita elec corp. of am. 775_f.2d_1107 1121 fed.cir.1985
the written description may however restrict the scope of the claims if` the patentee demonstrated an intent to deviate from the ordinary and accustomed_meaning of a claim_term by redefining the term or by characterizing the invention in the intrinsic record using words or expressions of manifest_exclusion or restriction representing a clear_disavowal of claim_scope'
teleflex inc. v. ficosa n. am corp. 299_f.3d_1313 1327 fed.cir.2002

we see no clear definition or disavowal of claim_scope in the written description of the ¡¬989_patent that would limit claim 11 to horizontal rotation through 360¢X
while it is true that the patentees describe their invention as having the ability to rotate through 360¢X this particular advantage is but one feature of the invented search_light
the written description describes other significant features as well such as the use of a particular_wireless_remote_control and differing mechanisms for attaching the search_light to the roof of a vehicle
the patentees were not required to include within each of their claims all of these advantages or features described as significant or important in the written description
see e-pass techs. inc. v. 3com corp. 343_f.3d_1364 1370 fed.cir.2003` an invention may possess a number of advantages or purposes and there is no requirement that every claim directed to that invention be limited to encompass all of them
`` ; sri_int l 775 f.2d at 1121` if everything in the specification were required to be read into the claims or if structural claims were to be limited to devices operated precisely as a specification-described embodiment is operated there would be no need for claims
``

nor do we find the disclosure of a single_embodiment to be limiting in this case
an applicant is not necessarily required by 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
1 to describe more embodiments than its preferred one and we have outright rejected the notion that disclosure of a single_embodiment necessarily limits the claims
see teleflex 299 f.3d at 1327 stating that` the number of embodiments disclosed in the specification is not determinative of the meaning of disputed *1332 claim_terms'
moreover` [ a ] bsent a clear disclaimer of particular subject matter the fact that the inventor anticipated that the invention may be used in a particular manner does not limit the scope to that narrow context'
brookhill-wilk 1 llc v. intuitive surgical inc. 334_f.3d_1294 1301 fed.cir.2003

thus we are unpersuaded by wal-marts contention that the written description compels us to import into claim 11 the requirement of rotation through 360¢X

b
with respect to the prosecution_history wal-mart first argues that the patentees acted as their own lexicographers giving the claim_term` rotating' a special_definition during prosecution
wal-mart relies in particular on the following statement in the prosecution_history [ t ] he pivotal movement in lipman is through a restricted angle and not rotation in the true sense of the word
in this relation the claims in issue have been amended to recite rotation through at least 360¢X and avoid an incidental_disclosure of rotation which could be imputed to lipman
according to wal-mart this statement applies to all of the claims including claim 11 then pending as claim 16 and it shows the patentees intent to specifically define the term` rotating' to require 360¢X of rotation
we disagree

`` generally speaking we indulge aheavy presumption that a claim_term carries its ordinary and customary meaning'
ccs fitness inc. v. brunswick corp. 288_f.3d_1359 1366 fed.cir.2002
however` an inventor may choose to be his own lexicographer if he defines the specific terms used to describe the inventionwith reasonable clarity deliberateness and precision
`` teleflex 299 f.3d at 1325 quoting in re paulsen 30_f.3d_1475 1480 fed.cir.1994
`` such a definition may appear in the written description or in the prosecution_history'
teleflex 299 f.3d at 1325 citations omitted
`` [ t ] he prosecution_history may demonstrate that the patentee intended to deviate from a terms ordinary and accustomed_meaning i.e. if it shows the applicant characterized the invention using words or expressions of manifest_exclusion or restriction during the administrative proceedings before the patent and trademark office'
id.at 1326 ; see also arlington indus. inc. v. bridgeport fittings inc. 345_f.3d_1318 1328 fed.cir.2003` in the course of prosecuting a patent application a patentee may redefine a claim_term
``

here we find no clear or express statement by the patentees giving` rotating' a special meaning
the statements in the prosecution_history relied on by wal-mart while arguably subject to the interpretation wal-mart gives them can also be reasonably understood as applying only to those claims such as issued claim 5 that explicitly recite that rotation must be` through greater than 360¢X'
claim 11 is not one of those claims
because the statements in the prosecution_history are subject to multiple_reasonable_interpretations they do not constitute a clear and unmistakable departure from the ordinary_meaning of the term` rotating'
see cordis corp. v. medtronic ave inc. 339_f.3d_1352 1359 fed.cir.2003 concluding that a statement made during prosecution` is amenable to multiple_reasonable_interpretations and it therefore does not constitute a clear and unmistakable surrender'

wal-mart argues that even if the patentees did not explicitly redefine the term` rotating' they repeatedly stated during prosecution that their invention was different from the prior_art because it rotated horizontally through 360¢X and the patentees must be held to those representations
wal-mart thus raises the doctrine *1333 of prosecution disclaimer` [ w ] here the patentee has unequivocally disavowed a certain meaning to obtain his patent the doctrine of prosecution disclaimer attaches and narrows the ordinary_meaning of the claim congruent with the scope of the surrender'
omega eng g inc. v. raytek corp. 334_f.3d_1314 1324 fed.cir.2003

wal-mart focuses in particular on the patentees statements in response to the examiners third rejection
the patentees stated in their response that the prior_art lipman_reference clearly` would not be rotatable so as to be able to sweep through 360¢X or greater as achieved by applicants invention' and that` the claims in issue have been amended to recite rotation through at least 360¢X and avoid an incidental_disclosure of rotation which could be imputed to lipman'
the patentees further argued claims 6_and_9 to 16 [ which issued as claim 11 ] have been rejected under the traditionally created doctrine of obviousness-type_double_patenting based on claims 1_to_14 of the ¡¬046_patent in view of lipman
the examiner might be justified in taking notice of equivalence of wireless_remote_control and hard-wired_controls for achieving the same end result but that does not justify applying to wholly different_types of adjustment and particularly where the claims recite the separate horizontal and vertical_drive_means for tilting and rotating as well through 360¢X as the separate_receiver_channels coupled to the respective drive_means to carry out two entirely different_types of adjustments ; namely tilting and rotation emphasis added
these statements can be reasonably interpreted as meaning that 1 in general lipman does not allow two types of adjustment tilting and rotating through separate_receiver_channels and drive_means and therefore lipman has a` wholly different type of adjustment' from that specified in pending claims 6_and_9 -16 ; and 2 more specifically lipman is different from those particular claims pending claims 6_and_9 -15 that recite` separate horizontal and vertical_drive_means for tilting and rotating as well through 360¢X'
in other words the patentees statements about lipmans inability to rotate through 360¢X were made to distinguish only those claims that explicitly recited a 360¢X_limitation
claim 16 which issued as claim 11 now in dispute has no such limitation
these statements therefore do not rise to the level of a clear_disavowal of scope with respect to pending claim 16

c. wal-mart lastly argues that we must construe claim 11 as being limited to a search_light that rotates through 360¢X because the claim_limitation of a` horizontal_drive_means for rotating said lamp_unit in a horizontal_direction' is written in means-plus-function format
see 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
6 2000` an element in a claim for a combination may be expressed as a means or step for performing a specified function.. and such claim shall be construed to cover the corresponding_structure material or acts described in the specification and equivalents thereof`
according to wal-mart the only` horizontal_drive_means' disclosed by the ¡¬989_patent is one that rotates through 360¢X

the first step in construing a means-plus-function_claim_limitation is to define the particular function of the claim_limitation
budde v. harley-davidson inc. 250_f.3d_1369 1376 fed.cir.2001
`` the court must construe the function of a means-plus-function limitation to include the limitations contained in the claim_language and only those limitations'
cardiac pacemakers inc. v. st. jude med. inc. 296_f.3d_1106 1113 fed.cir.2002
thus *1334 according to the language of claim 11 the function of the` horizontal_drive_means' is` rotating said lamp_unit in a horizontal_direction'
ordinary principles of claim_construction govern interpretation of this claim_language see id. and for all the reasons discussed in the preceding two sections we construe this function according to its ordinary_meaning as not requiring rotation through 360¢X

the next step in construing a means-plus-function_claim_limitation is to look to the specification and identify the corresponding_structure for that function
`` under this second stepstructure disclosed in the specification is` corresponding' structure only if the specification or prosecution_history clearly links or associates that structure to the function recited in the claim
`` med
instrumentation & diagnostics corp. v. elekta ab 344_f.3d_1205 1210 fed.cir.2003 quoting b. braun med inc. v. abbott_labs. 124_f.3d_1419 1424 fed.cir.1997
the ¡¬989_patent describes the structure for rotating the lamp_unit as follows the drive_motor 21 is mounted on a horizontal support_plate 52 which is of semi-circular configuration and provided with spaced bolt holes 54 aligned with the bosses 50 on the inner wall of the lamp housing 12 to receive fasteners 56
a pinion 58 projects downwardly from an output shaft not shown on the drive_motor 21 through an opening 59 in the support_plate 52 for intermeshing engagement with the gear_teeth 43
the support_plate 52 is journaled with respect to the gear 42 and the top wall of the base and the upper_housing 12 includes a downwardly depending skirt 60 which encircles the upper end of the base 14
when the pinion 58 is rotated by the drive_motor 21 it will cause the entire_upper_housing 12 to rotate with respect to the base_support_unit 14
it is highly desirable that the upper_housing 12 be free to rotate greater than 360¢X with respect to the base_support_unit 14 and to this end a follower_pin 64 includes an enlarged_head 63 which projects downwardly from the upper_housing through a circumferential_slot 65 in the support_plate 52 with the head 63 riding in the annular_groove 44
when the drive_motor 21 rotates the pinion 58 in one direction around the gear_teeth 43 the head 63 will move into engagement with the stop 45 but the upper_housing 12 and attached_support_plate 52 will be free to continue rotating since the slot 65 can continue its advancement until the pin 64 reaches the end of the slot 65
conversely when the pinion 58 is rotated in the opposite_direction the support_plate 52 and upper_housing 12 will be free to rotate through substantially 360¢X until the pin 62 moves into engagement with the opposite_side of the stop 45
once again however the slot 62 will permit the support_plate 52 and upper_housing 12 to continue rotation with respect to the stop_member 45 so that the upper_housing 12 is free to rotate through greater than 360¢X in either direction
¡¬989_patent col._3,_l._60- col._4,_l._25
this assembly certainly performs the function of ordinary rotating as stated by claim 11
while it also may be capable of rotating through 360¢X we see nothing in the written description that compels limiting the function to only this degree of rotation or to rotation through any particular_angle at all
moreover to the extent the assembly contains particular structures for permitting rotation through 360¢X such as the follower_pin 64 and slot 65 these structures are superfluous to our claim_construction analysis because they are not required for performing the claimed function
see asyst techs. inc. v. empak inc. 268_f.3d_1364 1370 fed.cir.2001` structural features that do not actually *1335 perform the recited function do not constitute corresponding_structure and thus do not serve as claim_limitations`
rotating the lamp_unit in a horizontal_direction can be accomplished through pinion 58 without the follower_pin and slots
thus even under a means-plus-function analysis we see no basis for importing a 360¢X_limitation into claim 11

d. for all of the reasons discussed above we construe the phrase` rotating said lamp_unit in a horizontal_direction' as used in claim 11 of the ¡¬989_patent according to its ordinary_meaning
the district_court correctly determined that this claim_language does not require the lamp_unit to rotate through 360¢X

ii
infringement
wal-mart does not dispute that its accused search_light infringes claim 11 as construed by the district_court
given that we agree with the district_courts claim_construction we affirm the finding of infringement

iii
invalidity
wal-mart argued at trial that claim 11 as construed by the district_court is invalid as obvious
the district_court disagreed stating that` [ w ] hile the separate elements of claim 11 all appear in various_combinations in the prior_art claim 11 is the first time all of the elements are combined'
golight 216 f.supp.2d at 1179
the district_court concluded that claim 11` would not have been obvious to one possessing ordinary_skill in the art at the time of the invention and [ it ] will therefore not upset the examiners belabored determination that claim 11 is valid as written'
id

on appeal wal-mart argues that the combination set forth in claim 11 without either a 360¢X_limitation or a` shoe' limitation,1 is obvious for the same reasons that the examiner made various rejections during prosecution of the ¡¬989_patent_application and its co-pending parent application the ¡¬ 046 patent application.2 according to wal-mart the claims of the ¡¬ 989 patent are not patentably distinct from the claims of the ¡¬046_patent which issued only once the claims included either a 360¢X_limitation or a shoe_limitation
because claim 11 does not have either of these limitations wal-mart_infers that it must be unpatentable over the prior_art cited by the examiner
wal-mart does not clearly articulate a particular combination of references that renders claim 11 obvious but it appears to rely on two combinations used by the examiner the combination of the allen merlo and montgomery references,3 as well as obviousness-type_double_patenting based on the ¡¬046_patent_claims in combination with the lipman_reference.4

`` obviousness is a legal_conclusion based on the factual_inquiries set forth in *1336 graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966) 1 the scope and content of the prior_art ; 2 the differences between the claims and the prior_art ; 3 the level of ordinary_skill in the pertinent art ; and 4 secondary considerations if any of non-obviousness'
mcneil-ppc inc. v. l. perrigo co. 337_f.3d_1362 1368 fed.cir.2003
we review for clear_error the district_courts determination of the factual_inquiries underlying obviousness whereas we review de novo the legal_conclusion of whether a claim is invalid as obvious
id

a
the district_court` considered the scope and content of the prior_art as presented by defendants including allen sr. merlo and montgomery' and concluded that while the separate limitations of claim 11 appeared in various_combinations in the prior_art claim 11 was nevertheless not obvious
golight 216 f.supp.2d at 1179
in making its determination the district_court noted that` wal-marts expert did not testify and wal-mart ultimately presented no evidence at trial to support its argument that [ c ] laim 11 is obvious in light of the prior_art'
id
the district_court therefore had no evidence outside of the prosecution_history of a motivation to combine the allen montgomery and merlo references or any other combination of references whereas golight presented testimony that there was nothing in these references suggesting their combination
moreover the applicant argued to the examiner that a rejection based on this combination of references was improper the examiners reliance upon allen sr. montgomery further in view of merlo is clearly piecemeal_rejection based on collecting together elements from different patents but without a principal reference which broadly discloses all of the elements claimed
the examiner subsequently discontinued this particular rejection of pending claim 16 indicating his agreement that the claim was not obvious based on the combination of allen montgomery and merlo

the lack of evidence of a motivation to combine is a critical defect in wal-marts obviousness defense because there must be` some suggestion motivation or teaching in the prior_art whereby the person of ordinary_skill would have selected the components that the inventor selected and use them to make the new device'
c.r
bard inc. v. m3 sys. inc. 157_f.3d_1340 1351 fed.cir.1998
based on the evidence available to the district_court and in the absence of any evidence to the contrary the fact findings underlying the district_courts decision are not clearly erroneous and we agree with the district_courts conclusion that claim 11 would not have been obvious based on the combination of allen montgomery and merlo

b
pending claim 16 was rejected under the judicially created doctrine of obviousness-type_double_patenting based on claims 1-14 of the ¡¬046_patent in view of lipman
in making this rejection the examiner took` official notice of the equivalence of wireless_remote_control and hard-wired_controls for their use in the illumination art'
the applicant then submitted a terminal_disclaimer disclaiming any patent term coverage extending beyond the expiration of the ¡¬046_patent
wal-mart_infers from this disclaimer that issued claim 11 is not patentably distinct from the ¡¬046_patent_claims and because the patentees could not obtain allowance of a claim specifying a boot_attachment during prosecution of the ¡¬046_patent they should not be able to do so during prosecution of the ¡¬989_patent simply by adding the limitation of a wireless_remote_control

wal-marts argument ignores the fact that claim 11 recites more than a search *1337 light having a boot_attachment and any kind of wireless_remote_control
rather the particular_wireless_remote_control required by claim 11 is
for controlling vertical and horizontal_movement of said searchlight_apparatus said remote_control means including a self-contained transmitter adapted to be carried by an operator of a motor_vehicle wherein said drive_means can be operated by wireless_transmission both from within said vehicle and at remote_distances from said vehicle without electrical_connection between said drive_means and said remote_control means and having an on/off switch and a four-way_directional_control_switch and a receiver mounted within said housing
the applicant defended the patentability of claim 11 pending claim 16 based on the combination of this particular_wireless_remote_control with the claimed boot_attachment claim 16 emphasizes the combination of a wireless_remote_control means for controlling vertical and horizontal_movement of the searchlight_apparatus including a self-contained transmitter adapted to be carried by an operator of the motor_vehicle both interiorly and exteriorly of the vehicle and having an on/off switch and a four-way_directional_control_switch and the receiver which is mounted within the housing and in further combination with attaching means on the base_support_member which includes a rubber_boot on the base_support_member and actuating means engageable with the boot for drawing it into vacuum-tight_relation to the surface..
accordingly there is lacking in any one of the references any teaching of the basic combination of a searchlight that can be removably mounted on a vehicle remotely controlled from the interior o [ r ] exterior of the vehicle and stowed inside of the vehicle when not in use
not only does this amount to piecemeal_rejection but it is submitted that the new and improved combination achieves a new and improved result in its ability to removably mount the apparatus on different surfaces while being able to adjustably control light movement in a horizontal and vertical_direction as well as its on/off state from inside or outside the vehicle
the examiner subsequently acknowledged that claim 16 was allowable without a terminal_disclaimer at least until the discovery of the lipman_reference thus indicating that this claim was patentable over the art cited during prosecution of the ¡¬046_patent even though this claim did not have a shoe or 360¢X_limitation
when the examiner discovered lipman shortly thereafter leading to a new rejection for double patenting based on the combination of lipman and the ¡¬046_patent_claims he used lipman only for its teaching of` a wireless radio remote_control joystick 126 for controlling lights 20 about multiple axes from a remote area'
but the ¡¬046_patent is not prior_art see gen. foods corp. v. studiengesellschaft kohle mbh 972_f.2d_1272 1281-82 fed.cir.1992 and this rejection was properly overcome by the applicants filing of a terminal_disclaimer

we disagree with wal-mart that we should infer from this terminal_disclaimer that the patentees conceded that they could not obtain any new claim unless it contained either a shoe_limitation or a 360¢X_limitation as did the claims of the ¡¬046_patent
rather the patentees arguments show that they believed the combination of a boot_attachment with the particular_wireless_remote_control means of claim 11 was unique-as indeed it was because there is no evidence of particular prior_art references that can be properly combined to show each of the limitations of this claim
we therefore agree with the district_courts determination that claim 11 is not invalid for obviousness

*1338 v. reasonable royalty
the district_court assessed damages of $ 464,280 based on a reasonable_royalty of $ 31.80 per infringing unit
golight 216 f.supp.2d at 1184 1188
we review the district_courts damages decision for` an erroneous conclusion of law clearly erroneous factual findings or a clear_error of judgment amounting to an abuse of discretion'
grain processing corp. v. am
maize-prods
co. 185_f.3d_1341 1349 fed.cir.1999
the methodology for calculating the amount of a reasonable_royalty to be awarded is within the discretion of the district_court based upon its underlying factual findings and legal_conclusions
see smithkline diagnostics inc. v. helena labs corp. 926_f.2d_1161 1164 fed.cir.1991

wal-mart argues that a $ 31.80 royalty is unreasonable as a matter of law because it would have left wal-mart selling the accused product well below cost
according to wal-mart it could not have raised the price of its products to cover the cost of the royalty because it was already selling the products at a loss
wal-mart proposes that at best any royalty should be capped at $ 8.00 per unit which was wal-marts profit forecast for the product

the evidence wal-mart relies on for its position is sparse comprising a few pages of sales data the testimony of one witness stating the cost of production of the radio_ray device and the following testimony of a sams club manager q
and based on those conversations what is your understanding of the kind of royalty that you as division merchandise manager at sams club would be willing to pay for merchandise sold by sams club covered by a claim of intellectual property of a vendor ?
[ objection overruled ] the witness 2_to_5 percent.. of the wholesale cost
wal-mart also relies on the cross-examination testimony of golights expert stating that in a different lawsuit involving car alarms and lost profit damages he indicated that a 2.5 % royalty might be appropriate but that` there [ were ] a number of different circumstances in that case.. all sorts of differences in that case that i could n't even imagine to try-try to bring this together right now'
wal-mart presented no expert_testimony of its own regarding a reasonable_royalty
golight 216 f.supp.2d at 1182
in contrast golight presented expert_testimony regarding a hypothetical licensing negotiation which would have resulted in a royalty_rate of $ 31.80 per unit based on fifty percent of golights incremental profit
id.at 1182-83

based on this evidence we disagree with wal-mart that the district_courts royalty determination is unreasonable
golight is entitled to no less` than a reasonable_royalty for the use made of the invention by the infringer together with interest and costs as fixed by the court'
35 u.s.c.¡± 284 2000
`` there is no rule that a royalty be no higher than the infringers net profit margin'
state indus. inc. v. mor-flo indus. inc. 883_f.2d_1573 1580 fed.cir.1989 ; see also rite-hite corp. v. kelley co. 56_f.3d_1538 1555 fed.cir.1995 en banc stating that` the fact that the award was based on and was a significant portion of the patentees profits also does not make the award unreasonable'
wal-marts evidence in this case establishes nothing more than what it might have preferred to pay which is not the test for damages
see rite-hite 56 f.3d at 1555
(` moreover what an infringer would prefer to pay is not the test for damages`
nor has wal-mart identified any other sufficient evidence upon which we could conclude that the district_court made any clearly erroneous_findings of fact when making its calculation

*1339 because we conclude that the district_court made no legal error and relied on no clearly erroneous_findings of fact we affirm the district_courts determination of the reasonable_royalty in this case

vi
willful infringement
the district_court determined that wal-marts infringement was willful based on wal-marts failure to take any action after receiving a cease and desist letter
the district_court also considered evidence that wal-marts device was a deliberate copy of the radio_ray
golight 216 f.supp.2d at 1184-85
wal-mart argues that the district_courts finding of willfulness is clearly erroneous because it is not supported by the evidence presented at trial
according to wal-mart the evidence of deliberate_copying by the manufacturer related to a different product
wal-mart also states that it presented undisputed evidence that no one at wal-mart had knowledge of the ¡¬ 989 patent until this lawsuit
moreover argues wal-mart when it received a cease and desist letter most of the allegedly infringing sales had already occurred and wal-mart sought assurances from the manufacturer that its products were not infringing
in response golight does not press the issue of deliberate_copying but instead argues that wal-marts failure to take appropriate_action upon receiving the cease and desist letter is sufficient to support a finding of willful_infringement

`` when it is found that the infringer acted without a reasonable_belief that its actions would avoid infringement the patentee has established willful_infringement which may be accompanied by enhanced damages'
vulcan eng g co. v. fata aluminium inc. 278_f.3d_1366 1378 fed.cir.2002
there is no admissible evidence in this case that wal-mart took appropriate_action after receiving the cease and desist letter to establish a reasonable_belief that its actions were not infringing the ¡¬989_patent
while wal-mart argues that it obtained a letter from the manufacturer assuring that its products did not infringe this letter was not admitted into evidence at trial and was rejected by the district_court as` crudely drafted' and` cursory'
golight 216 f.supp.2d at 1185
moreover while wal-mart claims that most of its sales were made prior to receiving the cease and desist letter there is evidence that wal-mart continued to sell off its remaining inventory even after it had learned of its possible infringement
based on this evidence the district_courts finding of willful_infringement was not clearly erroneous
moreover the district_courts finding was made independent of any evidence or lack thereof of deliberate_copying
the district_court stated that` [ a ] lthough th [ e ] evidence of collaboration [ to copy ] is strong it is not conclusive
however clear and convincing evidence does demonstrate that wal-mart acted in disregard of the cease and desist letter and in disregard of golights patent rights
accordingly the court finds that the infringement was willful'
id.at 1186
we affirm this finding because based on the evidence before the district_court it is not clearly erroneous

vii
attorney fees
as a result of finding willful_infringement the district_court awarded golight its attorney_fees but did not enhance damages
the district_court determined` after careful review of all the facts and circumstances and in view of the nine read [ v. portec ] factors which point in different_directions' that wal-marts conduct was not` so egregious as to warrant an award of exemplary damages'
golight 216 f.supp.2d at 1187
however the court determined` that due to the willful nature of wal-marts conduct this is an exceptional case' and that golight was therefore entitled under 35 u.s.c.¡± 285 to *1340 its attorney_fees
id
according to wal-mart this award was an abuse of discretion because its conduct does not justify the imposition of such a penalty

while a finding of willful_infringement does not require a finding that a case is exceptional cybor corp. v. fas techs. inc. 138_f.3d_1448 1461 fed.cir.1998 en banc` [ o ] ur cases uniformly indicate that the willfulness of the infringement by the accused infringer may be a sufficient basis in a particular case for finding the caseexceptional for purposes of awarding attorney_fees to the prevailing patent owner'
avia group int l inc. v. l.a. gear cal. inc. 853_f.2d_1557 1567 fed.cir.1988
based on a finding of willful_infringement it is within the district_courts discretion whether to award attorney_fees under ¡± 285
in essence wal-mart argues the district_court abused that discretion because` more egregious conduct than willful_infringement is necessary to hold a case exceptional' an argument that we rejected in avia
see id
based on the record in this case and the district_courts reasoned analysis we see no abuse of discretion and therefore affirm the award of attorney_fees

conclusion
because we find no errors of law and no clearly erroneous_findings of fact we affirm the district_courts rulings that wal-mart has willfully infringed claim 11 of the ¡¬989_patent that claim 11 is not invalid for obviousness and that golight is entitled to damages of $ 464,280 based on a reasonable_royalty of $ 31.80 per infringing unit as well as its attorney_fees
thus the judgment of the district_court is

affirmed

archer senior_circuit_judge dissenting in part
i respectfully dissent from the majoritys claim_construction and resulting affirmance of the district_courts finding of infringement because i believe the claim_language` horizontal_drive_means for rotating said lamp_unit in a horizontal_direction' requires the search_light to be capable of rotating through 360¢X.1 this means plus function_claim_limitation must be interpreted in light of structure provided in the specification
here the specification only describes a single structure one that shows only rotation through 360¢X
additionally the prosecution_history and other statements in the specification fully support requiring rotation through 360¢X

the claim_limitation is indisputably written in means plus function form
the majority correctly identifies the function of the` horizontal_drive_means for rotating' as` rotating said lamp_unit in a horizontal_direction'
under 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
6 a means plus function_claim_limitation` shall be construed to cover the corresponding_structure described in the specification and equivalents thereof'
35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
6 2000
the only_structure identified in the ¡¬989_patent is one which rotates through 360¢X when the pinion 58 is rotated by the drive_motor 21 it will cause the entire_upper_housing 12 to rotate with respect to the base_support_unit 14
it is highly desirable that the upper_housing 12 be free to rotate greater than 360¢X with respect to the base_support_unit 14 and to this end a follower_pin 64 includes an enlarged_head 63 which projects downwardly from the upper_housing through a circumferential_slot 65 in the support_plate 52 with the head 63 riding in the annular_groove 44
when the drive_motor 21 rotates the pinion 58 in one direction *1341 around the gear_teeth 43 the head 63 will move into engagement with the stop 45 but the upper_housing 12 and attached_support_plate 52 will be free to continue rotating since the slot 65 can continue its advancement until the pin 64 reaches the end of the slot 65
conversely when the pinion 58 is rotated in the opposite_direction the support_plate 52 and upper_housing 12 will be free to rotate through substantially 360¢X until the pin 62 moves into engagement with the opposite_side of the stop 45
once again however the slot 62 will permit the support_plate 52 and upper_housing 12 to continue rotation with respect to the stop_member 45 so that the upper_housing 12 is free to rotate through greater than 360 in either direction
'989_patent col._4,_ll._5-25
because the only_structure in the specification which describes the horizontal rotating means expressly states that it is` free to rotate through greater than 360¢X in either direction' only devices capable of rotating through 360¢X and their equivalents are covered by this claim_limitation ; a device incapable of rotating through 360¢X is not
the majority disagrees with this logical conclusion ignoring that there is nothing in the specification that shows or refers to a structure that does not rotate through 360¢X
we can not give a means plus function_claim_limitation a broader meaning than the structure shown in the specification or an equivalent thereof yet this is precisely what the majority opinion does
see johnston v. ivac corp. 885_f.2d_1574 1580 fed.cir.1989 [ s ] ection 112 ?
6 does not in any event expand the scope of the claim
an element of a claim described as a means for performing a function if read literally would encompass any means for performing the function
but section 112 ?
6 operates to cut back on the types of means which could literally satisfy the claim_language
( citations omitted

the majority asserts that` [ w ] hile [ the horizontal rotating assembly ] also may be capable of rotating through 360¢X we see nothing in the written description that compels limiting the function to only this degree of rotation or to rotation through any particular_angle at all'
maj. op.at 1334
the majority views the elements of the rotating means assembly that permit rotation beyond 360¢X as not part of the corresponding_structure because they do not actually perform the recited function of` rotating' the lamp in the horizontal_direction
this conclusion hinges on the majoritys view that` rotating' in the context of the ¡¬989_patent has no` special_definition' implying that any amount of rotation is sufficient to satisfy the limitations function of rotating the lamp_unit in the horizontal_direction
i disagree with this premise

in response to an office action rejecting the claims in view of lipman the applicants stated that the lipman_device would be capable only of tilting in different_directions about a single central axis
the applicants further explained` [ c ] learly [ the lipman_device ] would not be rotatable so as to be able to sweep through 360¢X or greater as achieved by applicants invention'
( emphasis added
this statement illustrates the applicants position the claimed invention was patentable in view of lipman because the applicants invention rotated through 360¢X and lipmans device did not
accordingly the applicants defined` rotate' in the context of the ¡¬989_patent to require that the horizontal_drive_means for rotating be capable of rotation through 360¢X

the majority notes other passages from the prosecution_history which support the conclusion that the means for rotating as contemplated by the ¡¬989_patent must be capable of rotation through 360¢X but dismisses them contending these statements *1342 are open to another interpretation
while that may be technically correct it is in my view a tortured reading of the prosecution_history
more importantly however the majority has not expressly addressed the applicants characterization of the invention recited above and the resulting definition of` rotate'
this recited statement was made in describing the lipman_reference and its relation to the rotation of the claimed invention

thus the majoritys decision is premised upon an incorrect interpretation of the term` rotating' as used in the ¡¬989_patent
under a proper interpretation of` rotating' 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
6 requires the claim_limitation to be construed so as to include only devices in which the means for rotating is capable of rotation through 360¢X

in addition to 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
6 the specification itself supports a construction of the claim_limitation` horizontal_drive_means for rotating' wherein the means for rotating must be capable of rotating through 360¢X
when describing the background and field of the invention the applicants stated` in removably mounting the searchlight on a surface it is important that the searchlight be securely installed and that the searchlight be capable of traversing greater than 360¢X..' ¡¬989_patent col._1,_ll._41-44 emphases added
further when describing their invention the applicants explained
[ a ] searchlight_apparatus in accordance with the present_invention includes a lamp_unit mounted in a housing which has a motor-driven vertical_drive_mechanism for tilting the lamp_unit in a vertical_direction and a motor-driven horizontal_drive_mechanism for rotating the lamp_unit in a horizontal_direction through at least 360¢X
providing lamp movement through at least 360¢X and preferably beyond is particularly advantageous in that it permits installation without regard to orientation
'989_patent col._2,_ll._3-11 emphases added
such a characterization of the rotation of at least 360¢X as part of the` present_invention'` is strong evidence that the claims should not be read to encompass the opposite structure'
scimed life systems inc. v. advanced cardiovascular sys. 242_f.3d_1337 1343 fed.cir.2001

as illustrated above the specification describes only a single means for rotating one that rotates through 360¢X
further the specification described the advantages of rotating through at least 360¢X as` important' to the invention
accordingly it is proper to read the limitation` horizontal_drive_means for rotating' as requiring rotation through 360¢X
see toro co. v. white consolidated indus. inc. 199_f.3d_1295 1300-01 fed.cir.1999 finding that where the specification and drawings showed a certain configuration and did not illustrate or describe any other structure and the specification described the advantages of the configuration as important to the invention construing the claims as requiring that configuration was proper

for these reasons i would reverse the district_courts claim_construction and construe the claim element` horizontal_drive_means for rotating' as requiring rotation through at least 360¢X
under such a construction wal-marts device would not infringe the claim as it indisputably does not rotate 360¢X
further a finding of noninfringement would obviate the need for analysis of the reasonable_royalty and willful_infringement issues
