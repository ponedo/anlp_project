background
presuming familiarity with chief_judge schwartz comprehensive opinion we describe here only the basic procedural facts and those particularly relevant to mercks arguments on appeal

mercks246_patent claims a method of using cyclobenzaprine to treat certain types of skeletal muscle disorders
the246_patent is the result of four applications a july_7,_1970 canadian application ; a may_21,_1971 united states application that was rejected amended and finally *1419 abandoned ; a january 31 1973 continuation-in-part c-i-p application that was rejected amended and discussed in an interview at which claims 1-5 were indicated as allowable ; and an april_9,_1974 c-i-p application in which those claims were again allowed
on may_6,_1975 the246_patent issued

applying in september 1970 for food and drug administration fda approval to sell cyclobenzaprine for use as set forth in the patent merck had submitted to fda an investigational new drug application that contained studies of cyclobenzaprine and amitriptyline as muscle_relaxants
cyclobenzaprines selectivity was emphasized.1 in july 1973 merck had submitted to fda a report compiling summarizing and evaluating its cyclobenzaprine research and noting that the predominant side_effect was drowsiness

in december 1975 merck submitted to fda a new drug application nda seeking approval to sell cyclobenzaprine as a skeletal_muscle_relaxant
mercks nda submissions were consistent with the earlier submissions and referred to cyclobenzaprines` propensity for inducing drowsiness'
the fda approved mercks sale of cyclobenzaprine as` an adjunct to rest and physical therapy for relief of muscle spasm associated with acute painful musculoskeletal conditions'
the package insert cited drowsiness as the most frequent side_effect

on october 31 1986 danbury_pharmacal inc. danbury filed an abbreviated new drug application seeking fda approval to sell a generic version of cyclobenzaprine for the same purpose
see 35 u.s.c.¡± 271 e 2 supp
iv 1987
on december 17 1986 merck sued danbury for infringement

district court opinion
the only issues at trial were those centered on danburys defenses 1 the claimed use of cyclobenzaprine would have been obvious in view of the chemical pharmacological and clinical properties of the prior_art compound amitriptyline ; and 2 the patent is unenforceable because merck intentionally withheld prior_art disclosures of amitriptyline and misrepresented_cyclobenzaprines side_effects

1
obviousness
the court determined that the sinha publications lances work on headaches and amitriptylines use in treating parkinsons disease all` strongly indicate amitriptylines effectiveness as a muscle_relaxant' ; amitriptyline and cyclobenzaprine` shar [ e ] a pharmacological resemblance' ;` several prior_art publications teach that amitriptyline and cyclobenzaprine behave similarly in a variety of tests' ; and mercks tests indicated that amitriptyline was effective` as a skeletal_muscle_relaxant but cyclobenzaprine was superior in potency and selectivity'
the court went on however to determine that the prior_art did not disclose a reasonable expectation of cyclobenzaprines selectivity

the court found that danbury failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that the246_patent was invalid for obviousness concluding cyclobenzaprine is distinct from previously known compounds in its selectivity
even if amitriptyline is a selective skeletal_muscle_relaxant of the class of cyclobenzaprine no suggestion existed in the art that either would be selective in action.. [ t ] he instant dispute concerns the relationship between two compounds with truly unexpected properties.. selectivity is simply not foreshadowed in the art much less strongly suggested
694 f.supp.at 32 latter emphasis provided

danbury has not in this appeal challenged the determination of nonobviousness

2
inequitable conduct
dealing with the withholding of prior_art the court determined that merck knew of *1420 amitriptylines muscle_relaxant properties and of the sinha and lance prior_art references but withheld all of that from the patent and trademark office pto ; mercks explanation for the disparity in its fda and pto submissions fda would require comparisons with amitriptyline` strains credulity' ; merck deleted amitriptyline from the inventors 1975 published article ; and mercks argument that amitriptyline was immaterial was` untenable in light of the evidence'

dealing with the allegation of misrepresentation the court found that merck in prosecuting its four applications argued over and over that cyclobenzaprine was free of the side_effects ordinarily associated with nervous_system_depressants ; mercks fda submissions and its own data indicated its awareness of at least one such side_effect i.e. drowsiness ; merck nonetheless told the pto that cyclobenzaprine was free of` side_effects of depression or causing muscle_weakness and drowsiness' ; and mercks conduct was` highly misleading and most certainly material'

the court held the246_patent unenforceable for inequitable_conduct in view of fmc corp. v. manitowoc co. 835_f.2d_1411 5_u.s.p.q.2d_1112_(fed.cir.1987) reasoning that i merck withheld material prior_art information concerning amitriptyline and misrepresented_cyclobenzaprines selectivity in response to the examiners objections to allowing the claims ; ii the persons responsible for the patent_prosecution arther [ mercks patent agent ] and share [ the inventor ] admittedly knew of the omitted information and of its materiality ; [ and ] iii damning evidence in the form of documents and chains of events that the omissions and misrepresentation were intended to mislead the pto

issue
whether the district_court abused its discretion in declaring the246_patent unenforceable for having been inequitably procured.2

opinion
equitable in nature the question of inequitable_conduct is committed to the discretion of the trial court whose determination is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard
kingsdown medical consultants ltd. v. hollister inc. 863_f.2d_867 876 9_u.s.p.q.2d_1384 1392 fed.cir.1988 in banc`
'to overturn a discretionary ruling of a district_court the appellant must establish that the ruling is based upon clearly erroneous findings of fact or a misapplication or misinterpretation of applicable law or that the ruling evidences a clear error of judgment on the part of the district_court
`` id
( quoting ppg indus
v. celanese polymer specialities co. 840_f.2d_1565 1572 6_u.s.p.q.2d_1010 1016 fed.cir.1988 bissell j. additional views

`` inequitable conduct resides in failure to disclose material information or submission of false information with an intent to deceive..' kingsdown 863 f.2d at 872 9 u.s.p.q.2d at 1389
although merck takes issue with the finding of intent it mounts its major attack on the findings that the withheld prior_art and its misrepresentations were material saying that neither related to the selectivity of cyclobenzaprine

1
materiality
a
withheld prior_art
first merck says the determinations of nonobviousness and materiality of the withheld prior_art are inconsistent because prior_art that did not render the invention claimed in the246_patent obvious because selectivity was not` foreshadowed' in that art could not be material
second in view of the claim limitation to *1421 selectivity merck argues that the withheld prior_art is merely cumulative because neither of the two references considered by the examiner were selective
see specialty composites v. cabot corp. 845_f.2d_981 992 6_u.s.p.q.2d_1601 1609 fed.cir.1988 ; manitowoc 835 f.2d at 1415 5 u.s.p.q.2d at 1115

first merck wrongly presupposes a` but for' standard of materiality
materiality may be established as it was here by a showing that a reasonable_examiner would consider the withheld prior_art important in deciding whether to issue the patent
in re jerabek 789_f.2d_886 890 229_u.s.p.q._530 533 fed.cir.1986
here as the district_court correctly found` amitriptylines activity was comparable to cyclobenzaprines' 694 f.supp.at 35 both having similar properties and effects
thus the withheld prior_art would clearly have been important to a reasonable_examiner

second the withheld prior_art is not merely cumulative because amitriptyline was as indicated in mercks own tests by far the most relevant to skeletal muscle relaxation
to fda merck disclosed amitriptyline not the cited prior_art to which it now says amitriptyline would have been merely cumulative
that the claimed invention may have been superior in one property to both the cited and withheld prior_art may be a basis for patentability ; it can not serve automatically to render the withheld prior_art either cumulative or immaterial

b. misrepresentation
merck says first its misrepresentation that cyclobenzaprine did not cause drowsiness is immaterial because drowsiness is unrelated to selectivity ; second its single statement on drowsiness has been taken out of context because drowsiness in proper context refers to drowsiness accompanying muscle_weakness ; third absence of a drowsiness effect was not relied on by the examiner in deciding to allow the246_patent ; and fourth it did not misrepresent cyclobenzaprines unique_selectivity

first the court found that cyclobenzaprines selectivity was related to the side_effect of drowsiness
it stated that` [ t ] o the extent drowsiness falls within the spectrum of sedation it appears.. that cyclobenzaprine produces sedative effects although not muscle_weakness' and thus` cyclobenzaprines selectivity is limited to its operation without loss of normal_muscle_tone'
merck has not shown that finding to have been clearly erroneous or that the district_court abused its discretion in so viewing the evidence

second the district_court did address mercks single june 1972 description of cyclobenzaprines action as free of` the attendant_side_effects of depression or causing muscle_weakness and drowsiness'
the courts reference to that one statement as the most glaring misrepresentation however was not out of context and does not limit its misrepresentation findings to that one statement
the entirety of the district_courts opinion recognizes the misrepresentations of cyclobenzaprines side_effects made throughout the patent_prosecution` [ e ] qually disturbing is mercks blatant misrepresentation of the side_effects of cyclobenzaprine in response to the examiners reluctance to put it mildly to allow the claims'
694 f.supp.at 35
merck was aware of the side_effect of drowsiness and that it clearly resembles side_effects ordinarily associated with nervous_system_depressants
thus the court correctly cited a pattern of misrepresentations regarding cyclobenzaprines freedom from the attendant_side_effects ordinarily associated with nervous_system_depressants

third merck again improperly argues for a` but for' standard of materiality in its assumption that the examiner did not rely on its drowsiness misrepresentation
to be material a misrepresentation need not be relied on by the examiner in deciding to allow the patent
the matter misrepresented need only be within a reasonable_examiners realm of consideration

fourth in view of cyclobenzaprines and amitriptylines comparable activity reflected in mercks tests we can not say the court abused its discretion in finding that mercks representation on the inventions *1422 unique_selectivity` was not entirely accurate'
whether that representation must be deemed a fatal misrepresentation is of little or no moment however in light of mercks pattern of misrepresentations

2
intent
intent need not and rarely can be proven by direct evidence
it is most often proven by` a showing of acts the natural consequences of which are presumably intended by the actor'
kansas jack inc. v. kuhn 719_f.2d_1144 1151 219_u.s.p.q._857 861 fed.cir.1983
in light of all the evidence rightly described by the court as` damning' including shares and arthers knowledge of the highly material amitriptyline prior_art the simultaneous submission of amitriptyline data to fda and its withholding from the pto the material misrepresentation to the pto of cyclobenzaprines side_effects and the decision to delete the amitriptyline portion of the inventors 1975 article we can not say that the courts finding of intent to mislead was clearly erroneous
nor can we conclude that the court abused its discretion in determining that merck was guilty of inequitable_conduct

1
the district_court indicated that` selectivity' refers to the ability of a muscle_relaxant to reduce abnormal hypertonic muscle tone without reducing normal_muscle_tone
the inventor testified that he sought a drug` without behavioral depressant effects which would impair the normal motor activity associated with the ability to carry out the tasks of daily living'
2
finding that mercks` flagrant' inequitable_conduct made this an` exceptional case' 35 u.s.c.¡± 285 1982 the court awarded attorney fees to danbury
mercks brief attacks the award only on the ground that the inequitable_conduct determination is wrong
that attack having failed we affirm the award
