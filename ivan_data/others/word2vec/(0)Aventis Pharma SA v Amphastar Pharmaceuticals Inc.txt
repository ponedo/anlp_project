opinion
prost circuit_judge
this infringement case returns to us for the second_time after remand to the district_court on the issue of whether aventis committed inequitable_conduct before the united_states_patent and trademark_office` pto'
in our earlier opinion we held that the dosage of the prior_art composition used in half-life_comparisons with the patented_composition was information_material to patentability but we remanded to the district_court to determine whether there was an intent to deceive by aventis in failing to disclose the dosage
after a trial on the matter the district_court found that there was intent to deceive and held the patents unenforceable for inequitable_conduct
because we find no abuse of discretion by the district_court in its holding of inequitable_conduct we affirm

i. aventis is the owner of u.s. patent no
re 38,743` the ¡¬743_patent` and u.s._patent_no._5389,618` the ¡¬618_patent` which was surrendered upon the issuance of the ¡¬743_patent
the patents are directed to a composition comprising low molecular_weight heparins` lmwhs'
claim 1 of the ¡¬618_patent recites a heterogeneous_intimate_admixture of sulfated heparinic_polysaccharides such sulfated polysaccharides having a weight_average_molecular_weight less than that of heparin and said admixture consisting essentially of
from 9 % to 20 % of polysaccharide_chains having a molecular_weight less than 2,000 daltons
from 5 % to 20 % of polysaccharide_chains having a molecular_weight greater than 8,000 daltons and
from 60-86 % of polysaccharide_chains having a molecular_weight of between 2 000_and_8000 daltons the ratio between the weight_average_molecular_weight and the number_average_molecular_weight thereof ranging from 1.big_token__3_to_1__big_token6. said admixture i exhibiting a bioavailability and antithrombotic_activity greater than heparin and ii having an average_molecular_weight of between approximately 3 500_and_5500 daltons
the drug is marketed as lovenoxthe_r in the united_states and clexanethe_r in europe and is effective in preventing thromboses blood clotting while minimizing the possibility of hemorrhaging especially during high-risk surgery
according to the specification the advantage of the claimed lmwhs as compared to heparin is that they exhibit a longer half-life excellent bioavailability higher rate of absorption low clearance resistance to degradation increased residence time and reduced sensitivity to serum factors
¡¬618_patent col._2,_l._55- col._3,_l._26

a
the prosecution history of the ¡¬618_patent is germane to the issue of inequitable_conduct
original claim 1 of the ¡¬618_patent_application recited as follows a heterogeneous_intimate_admixture of sulfated heparinic_polysaccharides such sulfated polysaccharides having a weight *1338 average_molecular_weight less that that of heparin and which comprise from 9 % to 20 % of polysaccharide_chains having a molecular_weight less than 2,000 daltons and from 5 % to 20 % of polysaccharide_chains having a molecular_weight greater than 8,000 daltons the ratio between the weight_average_molecular_weight and the number_average_molecular_weight thereof ranging from 1.big_token__3_to_1__big_token6

in the first_office_action the patent examiner rejected the claims under 35 u.s.c.¡±¡± 102 b /103 over several references including european patent 40,144` ep_¡¬144'
the examiner stated that each of the prior_art references teaches sulfated heparinic admixtures within the molecular_weight` mw' range of the claims and is considered to be inherently the same as the claimed admixtures
in particular the examiner explained that
the patent and trademark_office does not have facilities for testing and comparing various_products and where the prior_art teaches a product which is identical or nearly identical to that claimed it is incumbent upon the applicant to convincingly demonstrate that the claimed product provides some unexpected or unobvious_property not demonstrated by the prior_art_products
( emphases added

in response to the office_action aventis independently addressed the anticipation and obviousness_portion of the rejection.1 with respect to anticipation aventis argued that ep_¡¬144 does not expressly state that the mixture contains two types of polysaccharides one with a mw less than 2,000 daltons and one with a mw greater than 8,000 daltons nor does it state the number average/weight average mw ratio
presuming therefore that the examiners anticipation_rejection rested on inherency aventis argued that the evidence in the specification rebuts inherency
in particular aventis pointed to example 6 in the specification which provides in relevant_part

this example illustrates the increase in stability in vivo of the mixtures of the invention expressed by their plasma half-life
... 1 from the mixtures produced in examples 3_and_4 40 mg_dose in 75 % of the cases the half-life was longer than 4 hours and was even longer than 4 1/2 hours in approximately 45 % of the cases ; 60 mg_dose in 75 % of the cases the half-life was longer than 3.7 hours
... 3 when the product was prepared according to the process described in european patent ep 40,144 the half-life was longer than 4 1/2 hours in 17 % of the cases
¡¬618_patent col._9,_ll._33-58 emphases added
example 6 was prepared with the assistance of dr. andre uzan a french chemist who was a non-inventor
based on the example aventis argued that the claimed lmwhs exhibit a significantly longer half-life than formulations prepared in accordance with ep_¡¬144
aventis went on to explain that because it is well established that compounds are inseparable from their properties the evidence of a difference in a property i.e. half-life serves as evidence of a difference in structure
with regard to the obviousness_portion of the rejection aventis contended that under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 the prior_art must suggest the modification to one of skill in the art yet ep_¡¬144 provides absolutely no suggestion to select the particular combination of oligosaccharide chains of specified lengths as claimed
*1339 the examiner was not convinced and issued a second final office_action maintaining the prior 102/103 rejection` for the reasons of record in the last office action'
the examiner reiterated that the mw requirements of the claimed compounds are within the range of the compounds disclosed in ep_¡¬144 and that any properties would be inherent in the prior_art_compounds because they have the same structure as the claimed compounds.2

thereafter aventis amended claim 1 to read a heterogeneous_intimate_admixture of sulfated heparinic_polysaccharides such sulfated polysaccharides having a weight_average_molecular_weight less that that of heparin and said admixture comprising [ 3 ]

from 9 % to 20 % of polysaccharide_chains having a molecular_weight less than 2,000 daltons
from 5 % to 20 % of polysaccharide_chains having a molecular_weight greater than 8,000 daltons and
from 60-86 % of polysaccharide_chains having a molecular_weight of between 2 000_and_8000 daltons the ratio between the weight_average_molecular_weight and the number_average_molecular_weight thereof ranging from 1.big_token__3_to_1__big_token6 said admixture i exhibiting a bioavailability and antithrombotic_activity greater than heparin and ii having an average_molecular_weight of between approximately 3 500_and_5500 daltons
aventis also submitted a declaration from dr._uzan` first_uzan_declaration'
in ?
8 of the declaration dr._uzan distinguished the claimed formulations from the formulations in ep_¡¬144
first he noted that the half-life of the claimed formulation is greater than 4 1/big_token__2_hours_45__big_token % of the time as compared to the ep_¡¬144 formulation which achieved such a half-life only 17 % of the time
he remarked` this represents an increase in 250 % in the half_life and is very significant because it enables the same_effect to be achieved with lower_dosages'
further dr._uzan stated that he analyzed the ep_¡¬144 product and found that 21 % of the chains had a mw lower than 2,000 ; 6 % of the chains had a mw greater than 8,000 ; and 73 % of the chains had a mw between 2 000_and_8000
id
finally he concluded that` the formulations of [ ep_¡¬144 ] are clearly outside the scope of the present_invention'
aventis relied on example 6 and the first_uzan_declaration to address the anticipation_rejection arguing that the compounds disclosed in ep_¡¬144 are not inherently the same as the claimed compounds because the claimed compounds have a longer half-life and because compounds prepared in accordance with ep_¡¬144 fall outside the scope of the claims
with respect to obviousness aventis argued that the claimed compounds are non-obvious over ep_¡¬144 because the compositions in ep_¡¬144 did not exhibit the unexpected properties of the claimed combination of mw chains
in the third_office_action first_office_action in the continuing application the examiner affirmatively withdrew several 102/103 rejections over other prior_art references
the examiner continued to reject *1340 the claims under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 over ep_¡¬144` for the reasons of record in' the second_office_action
according to the examiner ep_¡¬144 teaches` admixtures of sulfated heparinic_polysaccharides having molecular_weight ranges which are not patentably distinct from those of the instant claims
`` 4 the examiner explained that` the instant molecular_weight requirements are highly similar to those of the prior_art molecular_weight ranges' and that no evidence has been presented that the claimed compounds would have` any properties or activities not necessarily inherent [ in ] the prior_art_compounds'
with respect to the half-life_comparisons between the claimed compounds and ep_¡¬144 the examiner stated that the` [ a ] pplicant has failed to provide evidence that the alleged difference between the half-life of the [ ep_¡¬ 144 ] product and that of the [ claimed ] mixture is statistically significant'
further the examiner contended that the first_uzan_declaration showed that the differences in composition based on mw were minimal and there was no showing of any unexpected results
aventis responded by submitting another declaration from dr._uzan` second_uzan_declaration'
in ?
3 of the declaration dr._uzan referenced five tables comprising the raw data from the half-life_comparisons between the claimed compound and the ep_¡¬144_compound which tables were attached to the declaration.5 dr._uzan also provided results from a statistical_analysis showing a statistically significant difference between the mean half-life for the claimed compound and that of the ep_¡¬144_compound
specifically dr._uzan reported` for the claimed compound t 1/big_token__2_was_4__big_token36 ¡Ó 1.07
for the compound of [ ep_¡¬144 ] t 1/big_token__2_was_3__big_token33 ¡Ó 0.2' and the statistical_analysis showed that 4.big_token__36_and_3__big_token33 were statistically significant
the mean half-life of 4.36 for the claimed compound was taken from table x which indicated the dosage to be 40 mg
the mean half-life of 3.33 for the ep_¡¬144_compound was taken from table iii which did not mention the dosage

aventis argued in its response that ep_¡¬144 does not suggest compounds containing polysaccharides of the claimed mw in the claimed proportions and that the examiner improperly relied on inherency to reject the claimed compounds over ep_¡¬144
referring to the second_uzan_declaration aventis asserted that different half-lives are obtained with the claimed preparation as compared to the preparation of ep_¡¬144
therefore aventis averred the claimed compounds have been shown to differ from the compounds of ep_¡¬144 in both their structure and properties

thereafter the ¡¬618_patent_application was allowed

b. amphastar pharmaceuticals inc.` amphastar' and teva_pharmaceuticals_usa inc.` teva' each filed an abbreviated new drug application` anda' with the fda to obtain approval to a market generic version of lovenoxthe_r
the anda contained a paragraph iv certification challenging the two aventis patents

*1341 aventis sued both teva and amphastar for infringement of the ¡¬618_patent in the united_states_district_court for the central_district of california
aventis_pharma_s.a. v. amphastar_pharms. inc. 390_f.supp.2d_936 938 c.d.cal.2005` aventis i'
amphastar filed a motion for summary_judgment on its affirmative defense and counterclaim that the ¡¬618_patent is unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct
id.at 938-39
specifically amphastar averred that dr._uzan engaged in inequitable_conduct by failing to disclose that the half-life studies comparing the patented_compound to the ep_¡¬ 144 compound were at different_doses
id.at 941 944

the district_court determined that the representation by aventis that the patented_compound had an improved half-life as compared to the ep_¡¬144_compound was material to patentability because aventis referred to the improved half-life at least four times during prosecution and the examiner ultimately allowed the ¡¬618_patent_application after the final representation that the difference in mean half-life was statistically significant
id.at 950-51
the court found a strong_inference of intent to deceive because it could find no credible explanation for comparing half-lives at different_doses and because comparisons at the same_dose showed little difference in half-life
id.at 951-52
after weighing the evidence of materiality and intent the court found weighty uncontroverted evidence establishing inequitable_conduct
id.at 952
it therefore granted summary_judgment against aventis and held the ¡¬ 618 patent unenforceable.6 id

on appeal aventis argued that the district_court erred in finding materiality because if the dose_information were material to patentability the examiner would have requested it because she was presented with half-life_data that enabled her to compare various doses dr._uzan informed the examiner that the half-life_comparison was done at different_doses those of skill in the art frequently compare half-lives at different_doses and half-life is independent of dose
aventis_pharma_s.a. v. amphastar_pharms. inc. 176_fed.appx._117 120 fed.cir.2006` aventis_ii`
to support the argument that dr._uzan informed the examiner that the half-life_comparisons were done at different_doses aventis relied on the statement in the first_uzan_declaration that` [ t ] his represents an increase in 250 % in the half_life and is very significant because it enables the same_effect to be achieved with lower_dosages' and dr._uzans deposition testimony stating that he believed this to mean` that the comparison is a comparison between two doses of which one is lower than the other'
id.at 120-21 emphasis added internal quotations omitted
aventis relied on this same statement to argue that dr._uzan did not intend to deceive the examiner
id.at 123
aventis further argued lack of intent based on the fact that dr._uzan submitted half-life_data for the claimed compound at 60 mg as well as at 40 mg. id

*1342 with regard to materiality this court held that it was not plausible to read the statement in the first_uzan_declaration as indicating to the examiner that the half-life_comparison was done at different_doses and therefore there was no genuine_issue of material_fact that dr._uzan did not disclose that the comparison was made using data for the two compounds at different_doses
id.at 121
we also rejected aventiss explanation for nondisclosure that using different_doses in half-life_comparisons was common practice in the field because in contrast to the references cited in support of this proposition aventis did not disclose the actual doses
id
further this court did not accept the explanation that the half-life_data were dose independent because the evidence clearly suggested otherwise
id.at 121-22
therefore we concluded that the withholding of the ep_¡¬144 dosage_information prevented the examiner from considering information important to patentability and constituted a failure to disclose material information
id.at 122

while this court found that the dosage of the ep_¡¬144_composition was indeed information_material to patentability we held that the district_court erred in finding intent to deceive on summary_judgment
id
in particular we held that the reasonableness of the comparison at different_doses is relevant to determining whether there was an intent to deceive in withholding the dosage of the ep_¡¬144_composition
id.at 122-23
this court reasoned [ t ] he district_court.. ultimately concluded that the facts supported a strong_inference of intent to deceive
the district_courts inference was reasonable-by failing to disclose that the ep 40,144 data was at a 60 mg_dose aventis may have been painting the rosiest picture possible as to the half-life improvement of its claimed compounds in an attempt to deceive the examiner..
however there is another reasonable inference-namely as aventis argues if the comparison between different_doses was reasonable the failure to disclose may have been due purely to inadvertence
id.at 123
accordingly this court reversed the grant of summary_judgment of unenforceability of the ¡¬618_patent and ¡¬743_patent and remanded to the district_court for determination of whether there was intent to deceive
id

following remand the district_court held a bench_trial limited to the issue of intent
aventis_pharma_s.a. v. amphastar_pharms. inc. 475_f.supp.2d_970 975 c.d.cal.2007` aventis_iii`
thereafter the court issued its opinion considering the principle explanations proffered by aventis for dr._uzans failure to disclose the dose of the ep_¡¬144_composition in its half-life_comparisons
these explanations were that 1 comparison of half-lives at different_doses was reasonable because it was customary to compare the half-lives of different drugs at the` clinically relevant_dose' i.e. the dose presenting the best efficacy-safety ratio and the half-life_comparisons were intended to show a difference in therapeutic properties not a compositional_difference ; 2 comparison of half-lives at different_doses was reasonable because half-lives are dose independent ; and 3 the failure to disclose was due merely to inadvertence
id.at 977-92

the district_court found dr._uzans clinical relevance justification implausible because such a justification presumed a compositional_difference between the compounds being compared yet the issue of inherency was repeatedly raised by the examiner during prosecution
id.at 977-82
the court noted that the examiner recognized that a compounds properties e.g. half-life are inherent in its composition and thereby rejected the claims as anticipated by the ep_¡¬144_compound under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102
id
therefore the *1343 court was not persuaded that dr._uzan presented the half-life_comparisons to show only a difference in property and not also a difference in composition
id
the court was similarly unpersuaded by aventiss dose-independence argument because the evidence did not establish that the half-lives were dose-independent given the high intra-subject variability
id.at 984-86

furthermore the court rejected dr._uzans clinically-relevant_dose_justification on the grounds that it was incredible because 1 there was no statistical_difference in half-lives when the 60 mg_dose of ep_¡¬144_composition was compared to the patented_composition at a 20 mg 60 mg or 80 mg_dose i.e. there was a statistical_difference only when a 40 mg_dose of the patented_composition was compared ; 2 the ¡¬618_patent was not limited to safe and effective doses for particular therapeutic indications ; 3 there were a number of preferred therapeutic doses for the patented_composition ; and 4 aventis offered no corroborating evidence to support dr._uzans clinically relevant_dose_justification
id.at 986-89

finally the court declined to find that dr._uzans failure to disclose the difference in doses could be justified based on inadvertence because it was not credible that a scientist with dr._uzans qualifications could have committed and failed to correct during a lengthy prosecution such an egregious error and there was a complete absence of evidence suggesting negligence throughout prosecution
id.at 989-92

based on the totality of the facts and circumstances the court determined that but for dr._uzans intentional omissions the probability was high that the ¡¬618_patent would not have issued
id.at 994
accordingly the court held the ¡¬618_patent and the ¡¬743_patent unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct

iii
a
now on its second_time on appeal aventis offers a new justification for dr._uzans failure to disclose the dosage_information in his half-life_comparisons.7 according to aventis dr._uzans half-life_comparisons were intended to show a difference in properties in response to the obviousness_rejection under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 not to demonstrate a compositional_difference to address the anticipation_rejection under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 as the district_court concluded
aventiss argument is premised on the fact that while a half-life_comparison must be done using equivalent doses to establish a compositional_difference a half-life_comparison may be done using different_doses if the purpose is to establish a difference in property
in fact aventis argues it is more appropriate to use the` clinically relevant_dose' of each compound to demonstrate a difference in property

as a preliminary matter it appears that aventiss argument would require us at least in part to revisit our prior holding on materiality
the essence of aventiss argument is that the reason that dr._uzan did not disclose the dosage of the prior_art_compound in his half-life_comparisons is that the comparisons were not being used to show a compositional_difference and therefore the dosage_information was not material
we have previously determined however that the dosage_information was material to patentability
aventis_ii 176 fed.appx.at 122
nevertheless because materiality and intent to deceive are necessarily intertwined kimberly-clark corp. v. johnson & johnson 745_f.2d_1437 1455 fed.cir.1984 we will consider the merits of aventiss argument with respect to deceptive_intent

aventis contends that the district_court made two clearly erroneous_findings of fact 1 that the central_question relating to patentability was compositional_differences and 2 that the purpose of dr._uzans half-life_comparisons was to show compositional_differences
according to aventis coursing throughout the district_courts opinion is the notion that the central_question relating to patentability was compositional_differences
during oral argument aventis emphasized that the district_court referred to compositional_differences nineteen times in its opinion
oral arg.at 3:9-3:17 available at http //www.cafc.uscourts.gov/oralarguments/mp3/2007-1280.mp3
as an example aventis quoted the court thus the central_question throughout the prosecution of the ¡¬618_patent was whether the [ claimed ] and [ the ] ep_¡¬144 lmwh products were compositionally different
*1345 id.at 10:50-11:03 ; see aventis_iii 475 f.supp.2d at 982
aventis thus contends that the district_court erroneously concluded that anticipation was the only_rejection of record even though there was an obviousness_rejection present throughout prosecution
moreover aventis asserts that the district_court erred in concluding that the` issue of obviousness necessarily folds into and is subsumed by inherency'
aventis_iii 475 f.supp.2d at 982_n._10

we find nothing in the district_courts opinion to suggest that it did not recognize the existence of the obviousness_rejection or that it believed the anticipation_rejection to be the only_rejection of record
indeed several statements in the opinion clearly indicate that the court was aware of the obviousness_rejection
id.at 980` it also relied on [ the claimed compositions ] properties to rebut obviousness
``` [ b ] ecause the ratio identified by [ the claimed ] lmwh exhibited superior_properties over ep_¡¬144 the inventive formulation could neither be inherent nor obvious
``` this signaled to aventis that its reliance on biochemical_properties held promise for overcoming both the [ primary_examiners ] inherency and obviousness_rejections'
( emphases added
although the court incorrectly suggested in a footnote that obviousness is subsumed by inherency we see this as merely a recognition by the court that the notion of inherency was part and parcel of the examiners rejections
id.at 979
in other words the properties of a compound are inherent in its composition and therefore a difference in property could successfully demonstrate a difference in composition
id
the court understood that based on the information available to her the examiner viewed the patented_composition and the ep_¡¬144_composition to be inherently the same or nearly the same and because the patent office did not have the facilities to test the products the examiner invited aventis to provide evidence of a difference in property to show a compositional_difference
id.at 980 ; see in re best 562_f.2d_1252 1255 ccpa 1977
we find no clear_error in the district_courts ultimate conclusion

aventis next contends that the district_court clearly erred in finding that the purpose of dr._uzans half-life_comparison was to show compositional_differences to address the anticipation_rejection under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102
instead aventis argues the mw_distribution_analysis in the first_uzan_declaration showing a difference between the claimed compounds and those disclosed in ep_¡¬144 in the proportion of chains of a given mw was directed to the anticipation_rejection ; the half-life_comparisons were directed to the obviousness_rejection
further aventis contends dr._uzans statement at the end of the declaration that` the formulations of [ ep_¡¬144 ] are outside the scope of the claimed invention' was based on the mw_distribution_analysis not the half-life_comparisons
according to aventis the district_court improperly concluded that aventis could not establish compositional_differences with the mw_distribution_analysis so it relied instead on the half-life_comparisons to show that the compounds were not identical
in support aventis quotes the courts opinion but aventis could not successfully distinguish [ the patented_compound ] merely by appealing to [ its ] ratio of number average and weight_average_molecular_weights
the ep_¡¬144_patent is not limited by a specific ratio of constituents
rather it employs open claim language` comprising various proportions of particular molecular_weight products'
therefore aventis attacked sameness based on a difference in properties
oral arg.at 14:21-14:52 quoting aventis_iii 475 f.supp.2d at 980

*1346 we can not agree that the district_court clearly erred in its determination that the half-life_comparisons were at least in part intended to show compositional_differences
nothing in example 6 suggests that the half-life_comparison was designed to show only non-obviousness and not lack of identity
the beginning of the example merely states` this example illustrates the increase in stability in vivo of the mixtures of the invention expressed by their plasma half-life'
¡¬618_patent col._9,_ll._33-35
moreover the first_uzan_declaration does not clearly delineate between evidence intended to address the anticipation_rejection and evidence intended to address the obviousness_rejection
all of the evidence directed to the ep_¡¬ 144 reference appears in ?
8 of the declaration without distinction between the ¡± 102 and the ¡± 103 aspects of the rejection and there is no basis for concluding that the final statement in ?
8-' thus the formulations of [ ep_¡¬144 ] are clearly outside the scope of the present_invention' -refers only to the mw_distribution_data and not to the half-life_data
we likewise reject aventiss contention that the court did not recognize that the half-life_comparisons were in part intended to demonstrate nonobviousness
in fact immediately following the portion of the opinion quoted by aventis the court continued` it also relied on [ the claimed compositions ] properties to rebut obviousness'
aventis_iii 475 f.supp.2d at 980
in addition the court in reference to a statement by the examiner in the second_office_action observed` this signaled to aventis that its reliance on biochemical_properties held promise for overcoming both the [ primary_examiners ] inherency and obviousness_rejections'
id
therefore we conclude that the district_court properly found that the half-life_comparisons were intended to address both the anticipation and obviousness_rejections and to the extent that they were intended to address the anticipation_rejection the failure to disclose the dosage_information evidenced intent to deceive.8

aventis further contends that in the third_office_action the examiner withdrew the ¡± 102 rejection and maintained only the ¡± 103 rejection over ep_¡¬144
yet aventis asserts it was not until the second_uzan_declaration which was submitted after the third_office_action that dr._uzan provided a statistical_analysis showing that the half-life differences were statistically significant
hence aventis urges the examiner clearly withdrew the ¡± 102 rejection based on the mw_distribution_data and the half-life_data in the second_uzan_declaration was intended only to overcome the ¡± 103 rejection
aventis thus avers that the district_court erred in concluding that the anticipation_rejection was still pending at the time of the third_office_action

the court apparently came to the conclusion that the anticipation_rejection was still pending because the rejection had not been expressly withdrawn.9 *1347 id.at 982_n._9
although the court may have erred in concluding that the anticipation_rejection was still pending in the third_office_action that conclusion was not critical to the courts ultimate determination that there was intent to deceive
in fact as explained by the court

even if the court were to accept as true aventis [ s ] unlikely contention that by the time of dr._uzans second declaration the [ primary_examiner ] had conceded that the [ claimed ] and ep_¡¬144 products were different there can be no question that inherency was the central dispositive question up to that point
id.at 982
therefore even if anticipation were not at issue at the time of the third_office_action the court still concluded based on evidence prior to the third_office_action that there was deceptive_intent
any error by the court in concluding that anticipation was still at issue in the third_office_action does not override the evidence of intent to deceive based on the failure to disclose dosage_information in the half-life_comparisons in example 6 of the specification and in the first_uzan_declaration both of which were submitted prior to the third_office_action
we can not agree that the court clearly erred in its factual findings prior to the third_office_action and in its determinations with respect to intent to deceive based thereon
in sum we find that the district_court did not clearly err in determining that the half-life_comparisons were in part intended to show compositional_differences to address the anticipation_rejection under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 and therefore rejecting aventiss argument that they were intended only to show differences in property such that dosage_information was immaterial

b. aventis next argues that the district_court clearly erred in excluding evidence that comparison of half-lives at different_doses was the standard practice in the lmwh_field
the` clinically relevant_dose' aventis avers is the standard dose for comparison of half-lives and every contemporaneous publication comparing half-lives did so at the clinically relevant_doses even though those doses may have differed
aventis contends that dr._uzan selected the 40 mg_dose for the patented_compound and the 60 mg_dose for the ep_¡¬144_compound because they were the clinically relevant_doses
according to aventis the 40 mg_dose for the patented_compound was the approved dose for its most important indication namely prevention of deep venous thrombosis` dvt' during high-risk orthopedic surgery

the district_court excluded the evidence of industry_practice because it determined that such evidence was irrelevant to the reasonableness of dr._uzans nondisclosure
id.at 975_n._6
we find no abuse of discretion by the courts exclusion of the evidence
first evidence of industry_practice of clinically-relevant_doses would only be pertinent if there was a finding that the half-life_comparisons were used to address obviousness and not anticipation because aventis has conceded that half-life_comparisons must be at the same_dose to show compositional_differences
here however the district_court found and we have affirmed that the half-life_comparisons were at least in part intended to show compositional_differences to address the anticipation_rejection

furthermore the district_court after examining all of the evidence found *1348 it simply incredible that dr._uzan selected the clinically relevant_doses for his half-life_comparisons
in particular the court noted that neither the claims nor the specification were limited to prevention of dvt in high-risk surgical patients and that the patented_composition could be used at several different_doses for several different indications ; 10 that there was not nearly as significant a difference or no difference at all in half-life when any other dose i.e. 20 mg 60 mg or 80 mg of the patented_compound was compared to the 60 mg_dose of ep_¡¬144 ; and that there was no evidence corroborating dr._uzans testimony that he selected the 40 mg_dose due to its efficacy in preventing dvt.11 id.at 986-89
evidence of industry_practice using clinically relevant_doses would have no impact on the courts credibility determination with respect to whether dr._uzan intended the clinically relevant_doses in this case

therefore we can not agree that the district_court abused its discretion in excluding evidence that comparison of half-lives at different_doses to demonstrate a difference in property was routine practice in the lmwh_field

c. aventis advances several additional arguments focused on whether dr._uzan really had deceptive_intent
first aventis argues that the court erred in not considering exculpatory_testimony by dr._uzan indicating that he believed that he informed the examiner that he was comparing half-lives at different_doses when he stated in the first_uzan_declaration` [ t ] his represents an increase in 250 % in the half_life and is very significant because it enables the same_effect to be achieved with lower_dosages'
this court already concluded in the prior appeal` that there is no genuine_issue of material_fact that dr._uzan did not disclose in this statement that the comparison was made using data from different_doses'
aventis_ii 176 fed.appx.at 121
we left open the possibility however that dr._uzan may have intended by this statement to convey to the examiner that the half-life_comparisons were done at different_doses
id.at 121_n._2
the district_court heard dr._uzans testimony and considered it along with all other_evidence relevant to deceptive_intent yet determined that it did not outweigh the cumulative evidence evincing an intent to deceive
we can not find that the district_court clearly erred in concluding that other_evidence outweighed dr._uzans testimony that he intended by this statement to inform the examiner that the half-life_comparisons were done at different_doses

next aventis avers that dr._uzan did not fail to disclose the dosage_information for the patented_compound to the examiner
in example 6 aventis urges dr._uzan provided half-life_data for the patented_compound at 60 mg as well as at 40 mg ; and in the second_uzan_declaration he attached the raw half-life_data for the patented_compound in table xi which *1349 showed that the half-life of the patented_compound was less at a 60 mg_dose than at the 40 mg_dose that was used in the comparison with the ep_¡¬144_compound
even if we acknowledge that half-life_data at other_doses for the patented_compound were provided to the examiner the data were provided in a very misleading_way
paragon podiatry lab. inc. v. klm labs. inc. 984_f.2d_1182 1191 fed.cir.1993 inference of deceptive_intent may arise from misleading character of affidavit ; accord b.f. goodrich co. v. aircraft braking sys corp. 72_f.3d_1577 1585 fed.cir.1996
in example 6 half-life_data for the patented_compound at the 4 1/2 hour_cut-off which could be readily compared to the 4 1/2 hour_cut-off data for the ep_¡¬144_compound were only provided at the 40 mg_dose
in the first_uzan_declaration reference was made only to the half-life_comparison at the 4 1/2 hour_cut-off without reference to the dosage of the patented_compound
moreover dr._uzan failed to disclose in either example 6 or the first_uzan_declaration the dosage_information for the ep_¡¬144_compound
accordingly we can not conclude that the district_courts finding that dr._uzan failed to disclose the dosage_information was clearly erroneous

lastly aventis contends that dr._uzans failure to disclose the dosage_information was purely due to inadvertence
in support aventis relies on other_evidence of inadvertent and benign mistakes made during prosecution of the ¡¬618_patent_application suggesting that its omission of the dose of the ep_¡¬144_compound was likewise inadvertent
for example aventis points out that the first_uzan_declaration mistakenly stated that the claimed compound had 1.5 % of chains below a specified mw whereas the remarks by aventis in its response stated 31.5 % of the chains
here however in contrast to any inadvertent omissions made during prosecution there is sufficient evidence of concealment to warrant a determination that the dose_information was intentionally withheld
the fact that aventis made other inadvertent errors during prosecution has no bearing on this material failure to disclose
therefore we can not agree that the district_court clearly erred by not concluding that dr._uzans failure to disclose the dosage_information was due to mere inadvertence

iv
for the foregoing reasons we affirm the district_courts finding of inequitable_conduct and holding of unenforceability of the ¡¬618 and ¡¬743_patent s

affirmed

rader circuit_judge dissenting
this court today affirms the unenforceability of a patent due to inequitable_conduct
to my eyes this record does not show clear and convincing_evidence of intent to deceive the united_states_patent and trademark_office uspto
moreover my reading of our case law restricts a finding of inequitable_conduct to only the most extreme cases of fraud and deception

without doubt candor and truthful cooperation are essential to an ex parte examination system
with burgeoning application rates the uspto must rely on applicant submissions to narrow the prior_art search
and of course those submissions must be reliable
the threat of inequitable_conduct with its` atomic bomb' remedy of unenforceability ensures that candor and truthfulness

although designed to facilitate uspto examination inequitable_conduct has taken on a new life as a litigation tactic
the allegation of inequitable_conduct opens new avenues of discovery ; impugns the integrity of patentee its counsel and the *1350 patent itself ; excludes the prosecuting attorney from trial participation other than as a witness ; and even offers the trial_court a way to dispose of a case without the rigors of claim construction and other complex patent doctrines
this court has even observed a number of cases such as this one that arrive on appeal solely on the basis of inequitable_conduct where the trial_court has apparently elected to try this issue in advance of the issues of infringement and validity
see e.g. frazier v. roessel cine photo tech inc. 417_f.3d_1230_(fed.cir.2005) ; semiconductor energy lab co. v. samsung elecs co. 204_f.3d_1368_(fed.cir.2000)

this phenomenon is not new or unprecedented
at an earlier time the federal_circuit also observed that inequitable_conduct as a litigation strategy had become a` plague'
burlington indus
v. dayco corp. 849_f.2d_1418 1422 fed.cir.1988
in response this court took a case to reduce abuse of inequitable_conduct
kingsdown_med consultants ltd. v. hollister inc. 863_f.2d_867 876 fed.cir.1988 en banc

in light of the rejuvenation of the inequitable_conduct_tactic this court ought to revisit occasionally its kingsdown opinion
kingsdown claimed a two-piece ostomy device
id.at 869
the examiner rejected claim 50 as indefinite
id.at 870
in response kingsdown amended claim 50
id
then later in the prosecution kingsdown copied the rejected claim 50 not the amended version into a continuation application as new claim 43
id.at 870-71
the once rejected now recopied claim 43 matured into claim 9 of u.s. patent no._4460,363
id.at 871
on the basis of this error that certainly called into question the integrity of the examination system the district_court found inequitable_conduct
id.at 871-72
this court en banc reversed
id.at 877

in kingsdown this court clearly conveyed that the inequitable_conduct was not a remedy for every mistake blunder or fault in the patent procurement process
even mistakes that struck at the heart and integrity of the process-like repeatedly recopying and acquiring rights to a rejected claim-did not amount to inequitable_conduct
instead this court required` culpable' conduct supported by clear and convincing_evidence of intent to deceive the uspto
halliburton co. v. schlumberger tech corp. 925_f.2d_1435 1443 fed.cir.1991 citing consol aluminum corp. v. foseco int l ltd. 910_f.2d_804 809 fed.cir.1990
at the same time it is hard to imagine a more material mistake than reasserting claims to rejected subject matter
materiality of any undisclosed or misleading information of course is the other prong of an inequitable_conduct analysis
cargill inc. v. canbra_foods ltd. 476_f.3d_1359 1363 fed.cir.2007
in sum kingsdown properly made inequitable_conduct a rare occurrence

more recently however the judicial process has too often emphasized materiality almost to the exclusion of any analysis of the lofty intent requirement for inequitable_conduct
merging intent and materiality at levels far below the kingsdown rule has revived the inequitable_conduct_tactic
for example in nilssen v. osram sylvania inc. 504_f.3d_1223_(fed.cir.2007) one of the reasons this court upheld a judgment of unenforceability for an exaggerated claim of small_entity_status
nilssen entered into agreements with philips electronics north america corp.` philips' to license the patents in suit
id.at 1227-28
because phillips had more than 500 employees the district_court found that nilssen had made several improper small entity maintenance fee payments to the uspto
id.at 1228
this court affirmed stating` [ w ] e therefore affirm the district_courts decision finding that all of *1351 the patents in suit are unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct in improperly claiming small_entity_status'
id.at 1233
in general electro music corp. v. samick music corp. 19_f.3d_1405_(fed.cir.1994) this court upheld unenforceability under circumstances that are even harder to reconcile with the en banc kingsdown rule
the mistake in that case involved a petition to make special
id.at 1407

the applicant sought expedited examination of its application on the ground that the claimed invention was being infringed
id
at that time such a request required an oath or declaration that the applicant made a careful and thorough search of the prior_art
id
the applicant submitted that declaration but later conceded that it actually had only conducted an informal search as opposed to a formal search
id
this process did not result in the issuance of rejected claims but involved nothing more than an expedited examination
still this miscarriage rendered the entire patent unenforceable
id.at 1412

while the case at bar does not feature small_entity_status or expedited examination the record still does not in the context of kingsdown show a clear and convincing intent to deceive
we are cognizant of the high standard of review
to overturn a discretionary ruling of a district_court the appellant must establish that the ruling is based upon clearly erroneous_findings of fact or a misapplication or misinterpretation of applicable law or that the ruling evidences a clear_error of judgment
kingsdown 863 f.2d at 876
while the standard of review is high it is not insurmountable
where the district_court made clear_error of fact this court must overturn such a determination

in this case dr._uzan associate director of biological research at aventis assisted in the prosecution of the application that led to u.s._patent_no._5389,618 ¡¬618 covering a low molecular_weight heparin mixture invented by roger debrie debrie_lmwh
specifically dr._uzan assembled data from various clinical studies comparing the half-lives of the debrie_lmwh to a prior_art lmwh invented by mardiguian mardiguian_lmwh
dr._uzan submitted this data from the duchier study and the foquet study respectively as example 6 of the patent
in submitting the data dr._uzan did not draw attention to the different_doses in those studies

without question dr._uzan should have disclosed the dosage of the mardiguian_lmwh in example 6_subsection_3
unfortunately the foquet study chart that dr._uzan used did not show the dosage_information
dr._uzan neglected to add the information
to make it clear dr._uzan did not attempt to conceal data that were otherwise present
rather he just submitted the study without adding to the disclosure
this omission even if negligent is hardly kingsdowns culpable intent to deceive
moreover this omission strikes less at the integrity of the system than issuance of a rejected claim which kingsdown sanctioned

likewise dr._uzan ought to have disclosed to the uspto that he compared the 60 mg_dose of the prior_art_mardiguian_lmwh to the 40 mg_dose of the debrie_lmwh in the declaration he submitted on march_29,_1993
dr._uzan testified that the different dose` did not come to his mind'
in context this explanation has merit
dr._uzan was asked to compare the superior pharmacokinetic properties of the debrie_lmwh over the mardiguian_lmwh prior_art_compound
comparison of drug properties at their clinically relevant and different dosages is of course completely appropriate
again this oversight may have been careless but hardly culpable
to my eyes dr._uzans negligence *1352 does not rise to the level of intent to deceive particularly in comparison with kingsdown

even a cursory review of example 6 shows no dosage indications
the debrie_lmwh in subsection 1 indicates two dosages
dosage is an element in subsections 2_and_4 as well
thus the absence of a dosage in subsection 3 is blatantly obvious
surely if dr._uzan had intended to deceive the uspto he would not have made this omission so conspicuous
moreover i find it difficult to fathom that a scientist of dr._uzans caliber and reputation would engage in such deception
as the district_court points out dr._uzan has had a magnificent fifty year career with aventis has published over 350 scientific articles and has received numerous prestigious awards including the galien research prize frances highest award for drug discovery
this world-class scientist would hardly risk his reputation and tarnish his brilliant career for a single example in the prosecution of a patent for an invention in which he was not even involved

the inadvertence in this case presents another difficulty for a finding of intent to deceive
the omissions and prosecution errors were committed by two individuals dr._uzan and mr._schulman aventis prosecuting attorney
collective actions call into question any showing of intent for inequitable_conduct
37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 refers to the duty of candor and good_faith possessed by` [ e ] ach individual associated with the filing and prosecution of a patent application'
( emphasis added
mr._schulman did not know that the doses of the debrie_lmwh and the mardiguian_lmwh were different
dr._uzan admitted that he inadvertently neglected to add that information to the graphs
the dosage_information was not on the original foquet chart submitted to the aventis patent department and dr._uzan neglected to add it
mr._schulman had no way of knowing that the comparison was at two different_doses and therefore the impropriety of using that data to demonstrate compositional_difference
mr._schulmans arguments also carry the markings of a good_faith mistake

most important dr._uzan himself revealed the error
this candor is inconsistent with deceptive_intent
he submitted all of the underlying data to the patent office with his second_declaration on june_9,_1994
thus unlike the situation in kingsdown dr._uzan corrected the mistake before it resulted in an issued patent
in dr._uzans second_declaration he clearly articulated that the half-life_data showed superior_properties of the debrie_lmwh over the prior_art_mardiguian_lmwh
still with all information before the uspto the examiner allowed the patent
lastly in early 2003 before filing its infringement suit aventis filed a reissue_application for the ¡¬618_patent
the patent reissued on june_14,_2005 with all of the original independent claims but without example 6
the half-life_data were apparently not even necessary for patentability
the uspto determined that the debrie_lmwh was inventive over the prior_art_mardiguian_lmwh without relying on the controversial half-life_data from example 6

the uspto granted the reissue a day before the district_court judge granted teva and amphastars summary_judgment motion that the ¡¬618_patent was unenforceable
aventis did not have the opportunity to make this argument to the trial judge
this record does not prevent this court however from considering all this information in evaluating the inequitable_conduct finding
thus both materiality and intent seem suspect on this record
in sum read in the context of kingsdown i would reverse *1353 the district_courts determination of inequitable_conduct

the examiner also reiterated that

one day prior to issuance of the district_courts order aventis surrendered the ¡¬618_patent to the pto pursuant to reissue_proceedings in the ¡¬743_patent application
aventis_pharma_s.a. v. amphastar_pharms. inc. 390_f.supp.2d_952 954 c.d.cal.2005
in a subsequent order the district_court granted aventiss motion to substitute the ¡¬ 743 patent for the ¡¬618_patent and amended its earlier holding of unenforceability to apply also to the ¡¬743_patent
id.at 957
in so holding the district_court relied on the well-settled principle articulated in hoffman-la roche inc. v. lemmon co. 906_f.2d_684_(fed.cir.1990) that a reissue_proceeding can not rehabilitate a patent held to be unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct
id.at 688
thus contrary to the assertion by the dissent op.at 1352 the district_court was fully aware of the reissue_proceeding yet recognized that any holding of unenforceability in the original application extended to the reissue_application
7
we note that in its first appeal aventis argued only that dr._uzan did not have deceptive_intent in failing to disclose the dosage_information because he thought he informed the examiner that the comparisons were done at different_doses and because he did provide half-life_data for the claimed compound at 60 mg as well as at 40 mg. aventis_ii 176 fed.appx.at 123
8
aventis further argues that the district_court erroneously imputed to dr._uzan arguments made by aventiss attorney mr._schulman in response to the examiners rejections
while it is indeed true that mr._schulman represented to the examiner that the difference in half-life indicated that the compositions were different we find nothing to suggest that the district_court relied entirely or in large part on mr._schulmans statements in determining that dr._uzan intended to deceive the examiner by his failure to disclose the dosage_information in his half-life_comparisons
instead we find that the courts conclusion rested almost entirely on example 6 of the specification and on the first_uzan_declaration
9
notably the examiner did expressly withdraw other prior_art rejections
also the examiner stated that the rejection over ep_¡¬144 was` repeated for the reasons of record' and reiterated that any properties were considered to be inherent in the prior_art_compounds making the record somewhat ambiguous
10
aventis disputes this finding by the district_court relying on in re chupp 816_f.2d_643 646 fed.cir.1987 for the proposition that a compound need not excel over a prior_art_compound in all properties to be patentable
however whether a superior property need be demonstrated throughout the entire claim scope in order to show nonobviousness of a claimed product over a prior_art_product is a separate question from whether there was deceptive_intent in failing to disclose material dosage_information in a comparison between the claimed product and the prior_art_product when there is nothing in the claims or specification to suggest that the dosage of the claimed product was the dosage used for a particular purpose
11
the court further noted that the 60 mg_dose of the ep_¡¬144_composition was the only dose for which there was half-life_data available
