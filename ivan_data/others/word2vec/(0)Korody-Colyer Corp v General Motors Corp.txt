the united_states_district_court for the central_district of california mariana r. pfaelzer j. granted defendant partial_summary_judgment and dismissed as untimely certain_antitrust_claims and appeal was taken
the court of appeals markey chief_judge held that 1 order staying proceedings on antitrust_claim pending completion of bench_trial of patent_validity_issue did not toll running of statute of limitations on plaintiffs amended antitrust_claims ; 2 plaintiffs amended antitrust_claims were entirely different than claims in original_complaint and thus amendment did not relate back to original_complaint for statute of limitations purposes ; and 3 defendants alleged concealment of evidence from plaintiff did not toll statute of limitations on plaintiffs amended antitrust_claims

appeal from a partial_summary_judgment entered pursuant to rule 54 b fed.r.civ.p
by the united_states_district_court for the central_district of california pfaelzer j
and ordering dismissal as untimely certain_antitrust_claims appearing in a second_supplemental and amended_complaint filed by korody-colyer corporation korody against general motors corporation gm
we affirm

background
in january 1980 korody sued gm seeking a judgment declaring gms u.s. patent no._3555,972 invalid
gm counterclaimed for infringement of that patent
in january 1982 korody answered the counterclaim alleging inter alia that gms charge of infringement was made in bad_faith to hamper competition that the patent was obtained by fraud that gm knew there was no basis for a valid_patent when it filed its application and that gm knowingly failed to disclose extensive pertinent_prior_art to the pto
at the same time korody added an antitrust_claim alleging an illegal tie-in and demanding a jury trial on that claim
in july 1982 the district_court entered a stipulated_order staying proceedings on the antitrust_claim pending completion of a bench_trial of the patent_validity_issue
proceedings on gms infringement counterclaim were also stayed

on august 10 1984 judge_pfaelzer held gms patent invalid as fraudulently obtained and for obviousness under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103
korody-colyer_corp. v. general_motors_corp. 224_uspq_368_(c.d.cal.1984)
on may_2,_1985 this court affirmed
760_f.2d_1293 225_uspq_1099_(fed.cir.1985)

in june 1986 korody filed the second_supplemental and amended_complaint at issue here
that complaint contained an added claim that gm had violated the antitrust_laws by enforcing a knowingly invalid_patent fraudulently obtained a claim designated by all concerned as a` walker_process' claim.1

on december 3 1986 after a hearing judge_pfaelzer filed clear succinct and complete findings and conclusions and entered her summary_judgment of the same date holding that korodys` walker_process' claim was barred by the four-year *1574 statute of limitations 15 u.s.c.¡± 15 b
the court rejected each of the arguments for tolling presented by korody

issue
whether the district_court erred in dismissing korodys second_supplemental and amended_complaint as barred by the statute of limitations

opinion
jurisdiction
in usm_corp. v. sps technologies inc. 770_f.2d_1035 1037 226_uspq_1038 1039-40 fed.cir.1985 this court transferred an appeal on a separated antitrust phase of a patent-antitrust suit because 1 transfer advanced judicial_economy the seventh circuit having heard two prior appeals in the case in which underlying issues had been briefed ; and 2 the separation occurred before this court existed and could not have been designed to manipulate our jurisdiction
we there cautioned that the decision to transfer` must not be viewed as indicating how we will rule in future cases for the circumstances that here prevail may well not recur'
id. 226 uspq at 1040
the present_appeal is the first since usm_corp. in which antitrust related issues were decided by the district_court after the patent_phase had been finally decided at the appellate level
here however considerations of judicial_economy cut the other way
the circumstance in which a regional circuit had decided the patent_phase in an earlier appeal has not recurred
the present_appeal though it turns on application of the statute of limitations implicates antitrust considerations with respect to which this court will apply discernible ninth_circuit law
the district_courts jurisdiction was indisputably based on 28 u.s.c.¡± 1338
this court having exercised its jurisdiction in the prior appeal is best situated to and will continue to exercise its jurisdiction in this follow-on appeal

korodys arguments
it is undisputed that absent tolling korodys second_supplemental and amended_complaint amendment is barred
making initially no reference to what the district_court did korody simply repeats before us the four reasons for tolling rejected by the district_court 1 the july 1982 stay worked an equitable estoppel ; 2 the june 1986 amendment related back to the earlier antitrust_complaint ; 3 gm fraudulently concealed certain evidence ; 4 gms antitrust_violation was continuing
none of those arguments has merit

( 1 equitable estoppel
korody at no point suggested to the district_court or to this court any basis whatever for failure to amend its complaint because of the stay
it admits that its antitrust counsel` withdrew' when the stay was entered to return to the fray only after the trial and appeal were completed in the patent validity case
it states the obvious i.e. that the parties` understood' that the stipulated_order` stayed the antitrust_claim' and implies that it was thereby precluded or excused from amending its antitrust_claim
the argument slides over what was stayed i.e. discovery on korodys tie-in claim the only antitrust_claim then extant.2 korodys argument also disingenuously disregards judge_pfaelzers clear explanation at the hearing

the court i never-just so that you can add to your argument-the court never kept them from amending any pleading on any ground whatsoever
[ counsel for gm ] absolutely not
the court i do n't have any order in that file that said that
it also disregards this in the district_courts finding 11 and conclusion 7 11
at no time did the courts order preclude korody from amending or seeking to amend its antitrust_complaint
7
the statute of limitations was not equitably tolled under the courts july *1575 21 1982 order because that order did not preclude amendment of the complaint to add walker_process claims

it also disregards this colloquoy at the hearing [ counsel for korody ] yes your honor
while this court was working on that [ the related patent validity case ] the antitrust attorneys were out of the court in fact
the court they were only out of the court in the sense that we delayed the trial of the tie-in case
nobody ever told anybody on korody-colyers side that they could not amend the pleadings
[ counsel for korody ] indeed
the court never
[ counsel for korody ] i agree..
the court if you want a walker_process claim you have to plead it

korodys reply_brief offers an after-the-fact interpretation of its counsels acknowledgement saying the parties` understanding' was not limited to the language of the order which literally stayed only discovery
yet korody points to absolutely no evidence indicating any` understanding' of gm that korody was precluded from adding its` walker_process' claim to its pleadings
nowhere does korody explain its failure even to seek leave of court to amend
korody also unfairly accuses judge_pfaelzer of making a post hoc interpretation of the stay when she said the order stayed` only the antitrust_action that was there'
nowhere does korody explain how a claim that had not been made could have been stayed

korodys reliance on mt
hood stages inc. v. greyhound corp. 616_f.2d_394_(9th_cir.) cert
denied 449_u.s._831 101_s.ct._99 66_l.ed.2d_36_(1980) is misplaced
in that case the court was accommodating enforcement of the sherman and interstate commerce acts and the factual issues in the antitrust_action were raised in the required preliminary administative icc proceeding
here the doctrine of primary jurisdiction is absent and the factual and legal issues raised by korodys` walker_process' could have been fully presented and decided by the district_court

on the entire record it is clear that from the time the stay_order issued korody simply forgot about its antitrust_action
neither before nor after the stay did korody indicate until june 1986 any intent to present a` walker_process' antitrust_claim
it can not now seize upon the stay as basis for excusing its slumber and its failure to amend its pleadings for more than four years

( 2 relation back
korody says its amendment asserting a` walker_process' claim relates back to its original_complaint asserting a tie-in
a mere comparison of the two complaints totally undermines korodys position

under rule 15 c fed.r.civ.p
an amendment may relate back when the earlier_complaint gave adequate notice of the new_claim
besig v. dolphin boating & swimming club 683_f.2d_1271 1278 9th cir.1982
korodys earlier_complaint asserted a single act allegedly violative of the antitrust_laws ; i.e. a tie-in
that complaint dealt solely with unpatented_parts and korodys alleged_inability to obtain them during the four months in which gm conducted its` kit' marketing program
korodys amendment asserted an entirely different act allegedly violative of the antitrust_laws ; i.e. enforcement of a fraudulently procured patent
it dealt with patented parts and korodys alleged_inability to make use or sell them during a period of years
because korodys amendment asserts an entirely new_claim for relief based upon different facts it does not relate back
see fuller v. marx 724_f.2d_717_(8th_cir.1984) ; besig 683 f.2d at 1271 ; national distillers & chemical_corp. v. brads machine products inc. 666_f.2d_492_(11th_cir.1982)

korody offers two disingenuous arguments in support of its` relation back' position its original_complaint included the catchall and meaningless phrase` among other_things' ; and its amendment is merely a` more detailed' statement of its original_complaint
the first would undermine *1576 the notice pleading approach of the federal_rules of civil_procedure
see 5 c. wright & a. miller federal practice and procedure ¡± 1215 1969 and cases at 110_n._61
`` among other_things' could not possibly give gm fair notice of korodys` walker_process' claim or of any other claim and to so hold would eviscerate rule 15 c and its statute of limitations protection
korodys second argument is simply untrue
the amendment alleges that gm fraudulently procured the patent enforced it in bad_faith interfered with korodys purchase of the patented product and falsely marked its patented pistons
those assertions can hardly be deemed a` merely more detailed' statement of a claim that gm is guilty of tying unpatented_parts

korody builds at most a colorable argument around its citation of clipper exxpress v. rocky mountain motor tariff bureau inc. 690_f.2d_1240_(9th_cir.1982) cert
denied 459_u.s._1227 103_s.ct._1234 75_l.ed.2d_468_(1983) and rohm and haas co. v. dawson chemical co. 557_f.supp._739 217_uspq_515_(s.d.tex.1982) revd on other grounds 722_f.2d_1556 220_uspq_289_(fed.cir.1983) cert
denied 469_u.s._851 105_s.ct._172 83_l.ed.2d_107_(1984) but its reliance on those authorities is misplaced
in those cases the original and later claims related to the same act and put the opposite party on full notice of the charge

korodys assertion that its original_complaint put gm on notice that korody was asserting both tying and enforcement-of-a-fraudulently-obtained-patent claims came as a surprise not only to gm but to the district_court who said remember this is a case i have been working on for a long long time and it would never have occurred to me that there is [ in the original_complaint ] an antitrust_violation based on the way they use the patent

korodys decision to press its unsupportable` relation back' arguments on appeal come as an equal surprise to us particularly in view of judge_pfaelzers conclusion 6 6
korodys amended walker_process claims do not relate back under rule 15 c of the federal_rules of civil_procedure because these amendments state a wholly new cause of action based on entirely different events and seek damages completely different from those originally sought

( 3 concealment
korody says gm concealed until 1983 the` outland_document' a report of gms patent counsel listing five patents and calling them` the closest_prior_art'
until it had seen that document says korody it had no basis for amending its complaint to allege a` walker_process' claim
the argument is fallacious

first in 1980 korody received from gm a number of prior patents and established in the patent trial that gm failed to disclose material prior art patents totalling nine in number
in a conclusion 5 simply ignored by korody the district_court correctly concluded that korody had all it needed for its july 1986 amendment in january 1982
that conclusion is confirmed in korodys january 1982 answer to gms counterclaim for infringement which contained these allegations 16
on information and belief the charge of infringement directed against plaintiff was not made in good faith but for the purpose of hampering legitimate business competition

?
?
?
18
on information and belief plaintiff alleges that the patent in suit was obtained by committing fraud upon the united states patent office that before the application for patent was filed defendant made its own_search and evaluated the results thereof and concluded that there was no basis for a valid_patent but nevertheless thereafter proceeded to file the application which resulted in the patent in suit
defendant its patent attorneys and the applicant for the patent in suit failed to disclose to the patent office extensive prior art references of which they had knowledge and which were pertinent to the subject matter being claimed in the application even though *1577 the disclosure of such information was required by patent office rule as well as by case decisional law of the united states supreme court
[ emphasis added ]

the foregoing allegations in korodys january 1982 answer were in substance identical to its 1986 assertion of its` walker_process' claim which reads b the acquisition through the knowing and active commission of fraud of the united states and foreign patents on the aforesaid crosshead piston including u.s
letters patent no._3555,972 to hulsing` hulsing_patent' which defendant knew was invalid and unenforceable ; c the threatened and attempted enforcement and enforcement in bad_faith of its fraudulently-obtained invalid and unenforceable patents against competitors in the relevant market and submarket including plaintiff and plaintiffs suppliers

indeed korodys 1982 allegations are closer than are its 1986 assertions to the language appearing in walker_process 382 u.s. at 174 147 uspq at 405-06` fraudulently and in bad_faith obtaining and maintaining.. its patent.. well knowing that it had no basis for.. a patent' ellipses in original

second korodys argument that its january 1982 allegations were based on` information and belief' and that it could not then have asserted a` walker_process' complaint without violating rule 11 comes with particularly poor grace
korodys answer to gms counterclaim is of the boiler plate variety containing twenty` information and belief' allegations most of which never saw the light of day at trial
within one such allegation korody asserted twelve different bases on which it is possible to hold a patent invalid
the answer also included korodys antitrust tie-in allegations as an affirmative defense of misuse
korodys effort to demean its allegations as based on` information and belief' is accompanied by no citation of authority that would countenance blind assertions not based on information and its present concern for rule 11 is at best belated

third korodys argument that without the outland_document it could not have asserted intentional willful concealment of pertinent_prior_art is specious
korodys answer made just that allegation albeit in different words` [ gm ] made its own_search and evaluated the results thereof and concluded that there was no basis for a valid_patent
``

a` walker_process' claim involves a patentees enforcement of a patent the patentee knows is invalid
if the outland_document might have constituted additional evidence of knowledge and intent or made proof at trial easier that would not be controlling
the evidence korody had in 1980 and its january 1982 fraud allegations gms bad_faith_enforcement to injure competition gms knowledge of unpatentability before it filed its application and gms failure to disclose known pertinent_prior_art coupled with the monopoly and market allegations in its then-filed antitrust_complaint obviously encompassed all that was needed to found a` walker_process' claim.3 korody points to kimberly-clark corp. v. johnson & johnson 745_f.2d_1437 223_uspq_603_(fed.cir.1984) *1578 and j.p. stevens & co. v. lex tex ltd. 747_f.2d_1553 1559 223_uspq_1089 1092 fed.cir.1984 and to the distinction it says the court there drew between` fraud' and` inequitable_conduct'
with the wish as father to the thought korody says the allegation of` fraud' in its 1982 answer was of the old garden variety kind and involved only` non-disclosure'
korodys difficulty is two-fold the opinions in the cases cited do not say what korody would have them say ; and korodys answer asserted far more than mere non-disclosure

in argus chemical_corp. v. fibre glass-evercoat co. inc. 812_f.2d_1381 1384-85 1_uspq2d_1971 1973-74 fed.cir.1987 this court noted the difference between inequitable_conduct that may render a patent unenforceable and intentional fraud that may lead to antitrust liability
and rightly so for in the former instance a party raises a shield and in the latter instance a party unsheaths a sword
the conduct alleged by korody in 1982 known absence of basis for patenting knowing non-disclosure of pertinent art and bad_faith_enforcement falls within both categories
though fully useful as a shield as it successfully was that conduct was clearly such as to warrant an assertion of a` walker_process' type antitrust_claim

lastly korody vigorously argues that summary_judgment was improper because the district_court resolved a genuine_issue of material fact when it found that gm had disclosed documents relating to the closest_prior_art including the outland_document in 1980
that the parties dispute the date on which the outland_document was disclosed and the district_court in colloquy referred to that document as` crucial' does not make the issue one of genuine material fact
see matsushita electric industrial co. v. zenith radio corp. 475_u.s._574 106_s.ct._1348 1356 89_l.ed.2d_538_(1986)
korodys` issue of fact' argument must fail for one main compelling reason disclosure of the outland_document was not a sine qua non for korodys` walker_process' claim the basis for which as above indicated korody had fully set forth in its january 1982 answer
the clock having begun to tick when korody received the 1980 disclosure or at the latest when korody confirmed its knowledge of all needed information in january 1982 a 1983 disclosure was simply irrelevant to the dispositive issue i.e. whether the clock had been ticking too long when korody sought to amend in 1986
whether the outland_document was disclosed in 1980 or in 1983 was not therefore a genuine_issue of fact material to a determination of whether the statute of limitations must be tolled
see rule 56 e fed.r.civ.p

( 4 continuing violation
because gms antitrust_violation was` continuing' says korody damages should be awarded for the period july 1982-july 1986

korody argues that gms threats against its supplier riken in 1983 was a violation
that issue was not raised before the district_court
it is therefore improperly presented and can not be considered here.4 korody then argues that gms defense of its patent through the trial and appeal of korodys declaratory judgment suit constituted a continuing violation.5

the ninth_circuit whose antitrust rulings are followed by this court in appeals from judgments of district_courts of that circuit see loctite corp. v. ultraseal ltd. 781_f.2d_861 875 228_uspq_90 99 fed.cir.1985 rejected korodys continuing violation argument in pace industries inc. v. three phoenix co. 813_f.2d_234_(9th_cir.1987) a case involving a fact pattern substantially identical korody admits it is` facially similar' in relation to the issue here
in pace the court said *1579 the initiation of a lawsuit is the final immutable act of enforcement of an allegedly illegal contract
at that point in time the lawsuit assumes an existence separate from the contract
all subsequent acts are controlled by the exigencies of litigation not enforcement of the contract
the complaint puts the aggrieved party on notice that there is a possible antitrust_violation
in every lawsuit a party has a right and an attorney has a duty to prosecute or defend vigorously
furthermore no new injury results from the act of appealing that the defendant does not already endure as a result of the act of filing the action initially
this is true because the reasonable expectation from the commencement of a law suit is that the plaintiff will pursue the litigation until it prevails or the last appeal is exhausted

?
?
?
we hold that the last_overt_act in the enforcement of this contract was the initiation of the lawsuit in state court
any injury to pace resulting from continued prosecution through the normal course of the appellate process related back to the initial decision to file
id.at 238-39 citations omitted ; emphasis added

korody has shown no error in conclusions 4_and_9 of judge_pfaelzer 4
gms last_overt_act to` enforce' its hulsing_patent its april_13,_1981 letter to korody was more than four years prior to the filing of korodys second_supplemental and amended_complaint

?
?
?
9
because the last_overt_act taken by gm in defense of its hulsing_patent was more than four years before korody filed its amendment to add walker_process claims no tolling of the statute of limitations by virtue of a continuing antitrust_violation can be established

thus korodys` continuing violation' argument has no support in fact or law

attorney fees
korodys brief in places recognizes that it stipulated to the stay_order and yet in other places argues that gm should be estopped to rely on the statute of limitations because gm` actively sought and obtained' the stay

in asserting that gm` sought' the stay korody not only ignored its own stipulation and its assertion elsewhere in its brief that the parties stipulated the stay to conserve resources and judicial_economy but presented a partial and distorted quotation from american_pipe and construction_co. v. utah 414_u.s._538 94_s.ct._756 38_l.ed.2d_713_(1974)
korodys brief says the supreme court` has not hesitated to find the statutory_period tolled or suspended by the conduct of the defendant' where the policies of repose and certainty inherent in the limitations provisions are fulfilled
american_pipe and construction_co. v. utah 414_u.s._538 558-559 94_s.ct._756 768-69 38_l.ed.2d_713_(1974)
what the court said in american_pipe 414 u.s. at 559 94 s.ct.at 769 was similarly in cases where the plaintiff has refrained from commencing suit during the period of limitation because of inducement by the defendant glus v. brooklyn eastern terminal 359_u.s._231 79_s.ct._760 3_l.ed.2d_770 or because of fraudulent_concealment holmberg v. armbrecht 327_u.s._392 66_s.ct._582 90_l.ed._743 this court has not hesitated to find the statutory_period tolled or suspended by the conduct of the defendant
( emphasis added

if the outland_document were not disclosed in 1980 as above indicated that would not have constituted fraudulent_concealment of the basis for korodys amendment a basis it had fully on hand in what was disclosed in 1980 and asserted in korodys 1982 answer
nothing of record indicates and korody does not argue that gm` induced' it to refrain from amending its complaint
the deletion from the quote if undetected would thus have served korodys interest
korodys reply_brief makes no mention of why it distorted the quotation *1580 by deleting` inducement by the defendant' though the distortion was set forth in gms brief

though gm called to korodys attention the inapplicability of pace to this appeal before korody filed its brief korody persisted in presenting its version of pace to this court as support for its continuing violation theory
indeed korody not only ignored the ninth_circuits explicit rejection of the theory it presented here but went further in separately citing twin city sportservice inc. v. charles o. finley & co. 512_f.2d_1264_(9th_cir.1975) and aurora enterprises inc. v. national broadcasting 688_f.2d_689_(9th_cir.1982) without recognizing or informing this court that those cases had anything to do with pace or that in pace the ninth_circuit had expressly distinguished those cases as not dealing with the issue before it and now before us.6

korody quotes a portion of a brief filed by gms present counsel in handgards inc. v. ethicon inc. 743_f.2d_1282 223_uspq_214_(9th_cir.1984) cert
denied 469_u.s._1190 105_s.ct._963 83_l.ed.2d_968_(1985) handgards_ii and quotes a portion of the courts opinion in that case
in both quotations korody wrenches the quoted material completely out of context resulting in a presentation that mischaracterizes and misleads
handgards_ii and korodys quotes simply have nothing to do with the statute of limitations/continuing violation issue so vigorously pressed by korody in this appeal

though each of the foregoing instances was called to korodys attention in gms brief korodys reply_brief makes no reference whatever to them
korodys filing and maintenance of the appeal borders the frivolous
it is saved from that designation only by some of its arguments
though lacking merit those arguments appear sufficiently colorable to bring the appeal itself just inside the border of frivolity

that we do not find the entire appeal frivolous however does not excuse korodys above-described distortions which wasted the resources of the court and the parties and abused the judicial_process
though we consider those distortions reprehensible we do not find that gm faced untoward difficulties in responding to them and therefore decline to award gm its attorney fees on appeal.7

conclusion
korody has shown no error of any kind in the careful and correct determinations of the district_court
accordingly the partial_summary_judgment appealed from is affirmed

affirmed

references in the present text to a` walker_process' claim should be read in light of the analysis in both walker_process and handgards
the appealed judgment of the district_court and its affirmance here deal only with the statute of limitations ; neither may be read as condoning the type of conduct alleged by korody
2
the complaint contained the usual allegations of monopoly etc. but the only act charged was a tie-in
3
as was well said in starview outdoor theatre inc. v. paramount film distributing corp. 254_f.supp._855 858 n.d.ill.1966` plaintiffs may not postpone suit until they have all of the information necessary to prove an antitrust_violation' when such postponement goes beyond the period of the statute of limitations
moreover the ninth_circuit stated in rutledge v. boston woven hose and rubber co. 576_f.2d_248 250 9th cir.1978 that knowledge that one has a claim is tested on an objective basis` to avoid the bar of limitation.. plaintiff must allege facts showing affirmative conduct upon the part of the defendant which would.. lead a reasonable person to believe that he did not have a claim for relief`
as judge_pfaelzer perceptively observed in this case` is there a patent lawyer alive who does n't understand what a walker_process claim is ?'
korody attempts to use the latter statement in support of its argument that gm was on notice that korody` had a basis' for a` walker_process' claim but korody thereby blurs the distinction between notice of a basis for a claim and the notice with which the statute of limitations deals i.e. notice of a partys intent to enforce that claim
4
the record contains only the unsubstantiated statement of korodys president that there was such a threat in 1983
5
though the distinction is of no moment in this case korodys repeated reference to gms` enforcement' can be misleading
gms mandatory counterclaim for infringement was never tried
the trial and appeal dealt only with the validity and enforceability of gms patent
6
korody at one point says pace is` not inconsistent' with its position but` to the extent it might be' it should not be followed` because it is not a final decision or is wrongly decided' without saying why it was not` final' or why it was` wrongly decided'
korody does then attempt to distinguish pace on the sole and irrelevant ground that it involved suits in state and federal courts

gm indicated in its briefs an intent to move for sanctions if it prevailed on appeal
there is no need for such a post-decision motion which would require the court to re-visit the briefs

as indicated in the text a filing of such a post-decision motion in this case would be fruitless
