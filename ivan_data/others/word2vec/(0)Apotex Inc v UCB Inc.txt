opinion
reyna circuit_judge apotex_inc. and apotex_corp. collectively` apotex' appeal the decision of the united_states_district_court for the southern_district of florida finding that 1 apotexs u.s. patent no._6767,556` the ¡¬556_patent` is unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct ; 2 apotex is judicially estopped from alleging infringement of the ¡¬556_patent by the accused products ; 3 the asserted claims are indefinite ; 4 apotex disclaimed coverage of the accused products from the scope of the ¡¬556_patents claims ; and 5 apotex is barred by laches from recovering pre-suit damages
apotex inc. v. ucb inc. 970_f.supp.2d_1297 s.d.fla.2013
because the district_court did not abuse its discretion in finding inequitable_conduct we affirm the district_courts judgment on that basis

background
a
the ¡¬556_patent
the ¡¬556_patent titled` pharmaceutical compositions comprising moexipril magnesium' is about ten years old
the patent issued on july_27,_2004 from an application that claims priority to a canadian application filed on april_5,_2000
dr. bernard charles sherman founder and chairman of apotex wrote the ¡¬ 556 patent application and is its sole inventor
dr._sherman leads the development of apotexs drug formulations and manufacturing processes and has himself written approximately one hundred patent applications for apotex
he also directs all litigation for apotex

the ¡¬556_patent is generally directed to a process for manufacturing moexipril_tablets
moexipril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme` ace' inhibitor used to treat hypertension
like other ace_inhibitors moexipril and its acid_addition_salts e.g. moexipril_hydrochloride are susceptible to degradation and instability
to improve stability the ¡¬556_patent discloses a process of making moexipril_tablets consisting mostly of moexipril_magnesium obtained by reacting moexipril or its acid_addition_salts with an alkaline_magnesium_compound
¡¬556_patent_col. 2_ll._53 -56
this *1356 process is captured in claim 1 the only independent claim of the ¡¬556_patent 1
a process of making a solid pharmaceutical composition comprising moexipril_magnesium said process comprising the step of reacting moexipril or an acid_addition_salt thereof with an alkaline_magnesium_compound in a controlled manner in the presence of a sufficient amount of solvent for a predetermined amount of time so as to convert greater than 80 % of the moexipril or moexipril_acid_addition_salt to moexipril_magnesium

in the preferred embodiment moexipril_hydrochloride is reacted with magnesium hydroxide or the magnesium_salt of a weak acid e.g. magnesium_carbonate to obtain moexipril_magnesium
see id
col. 2_l._66 -col. 3_l._5
the ¡¬556_patent explains that the reaction can not be accomplished in dry form and must be carried out in the presence of a solvent
id
col. 2_ll._38 -45
after the reaction has occurred and the solvent has evaporated the dried material can be compressed into tablets
this process is called` wet_granulation' and has been known in the pharmaceutical industry since at least the 1980s

b
the prior art
several methods for stabilizing ace_inhibitors in general and moexipril in particular were known in the prior_art before dr._sherman filed the ¡¬556_patent_application
u.s._patent_no._4743,450` the ¡¬450_patent` which issued in 1998 to warner-lambert discloses a method for stabilizing an ace_inhibitor using alkaline_magnesium_compounds
¡¬450_patent col. 3_ll._25 -35
the examples in the ¡¬450_patent use quinapril as the ace_inhibitor and magnesium_carbonate as the alkaline_stabilizer
id
col. 4_l._58 -col. 5_l._39
as in the ¡¬556_patent wet_granulation is the preferred technique for processing tablets according to the ¡¬450_patent
id
col. 4_ll._26 -28

the two accused products in this case univasc and uniretic are also prior_art to the ¡¬556_patent
both products are moexipril_tablets that have been sold in the united states since 1995_and_1997 respectively
univasc and uniretic are made in accordance with the process described in the ¡¬450_patent which defendant ucb inc. licenses from warner-lambert and has listed in the fdas approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations the` orange_book' for both products
the manufacture of univasc and uniretic involves the wet_granulation of moexipril_hydrochloride and magnesium_oxide

the ¡¬556_patent discusses the ¡¬450_patent and the univasc product
specifically the background_section states that univasc tablets contain moexipril_hydrochloride and magnesium_oxide and are made in accordance with the teachings of the ¡¬450_patent
¡¬556_patent_col. 2_ll._16 -22
this section also states that the moexipril_hydrochloride and alkaline_magnesium_compound are capable of an acid-base reaction that is difficult to control and results in uncertainty regarding the final composition of the product
id
col. 2_ll._31 -39

the ¡¬556_patent also discusses a 1990 article by gu et al.1` the gu_article' which describes the chemistry involved in stabilizing moexipril
gu examined the degradation of moexipril after mixing it with alkaline_stabilizers in both wet_granulation and dry powder mixing dry granulation concluding that only wet_granulation *1357 stabilizes moexipril
the gu_article theorizes that such stabilization results from` neutralization' by the outer surface of the granulated material and also possibly because` a portion of the moexipril_hydrochloride was converted to the cation salts via granulation' i.e. moexipril_magnesium was obtained
according to the background_section of the ¡¬556_patent the gu_article teaches that only a portion if any of the drug may be converted to moexipril_magnesium and that stabilization therefore occurs not because of conversion but because of the presence of the alkaline stabilizing compound in the final_product
¡¬556_patent_col. 2_ll._4 -11

c. the prosecution history
during prosecution before the u.s. patent and trademark_office` pto' the ¡¬ 556 patent received three obviousness rejections
first the examiner rejected the claims based on the combination of the ¡¬450_patent and u.s._patent_no._4344,949 which discloses using moexipril_tablets to treat hypertension
in response dr._shermans counsel argued that the cited prior_art did not disclose a reaction but disclosed only combining moexipril_hydrochloride and an alkaline_magnesium_compound
in support counsel submitted the product_monograph for univasc and the portion of the orange_book that lists univasc as being covered by the ¡¬450_patent stating applicant herewith submits the product_monograph for univascthe_r moexipril hydrochloride tablets wherein the tablets marketed by schwarz_pharma as listed in the fda_orange_book as per the teachings of united states patent no._4743,450 include magnesium_oxide ; unreacted but combined and functioning as a stabilizer see first page
the examiner is referred to those pages
full reconsideration is respectfully requested
joint appendix` j.a` at 12172 emphasis added

the examiner rejected the claims a second time but this time based on the combination of the ¡¬450_patent and the gu_article
the examiner observed that it would have been obvious to combine the ¡¬450_patents teaching that ace_inhibitor_drugs can be stabilized with an alkaline_magnesium_compound with gus teaching regarding stabilization of moexipril_hydrochloride via wet_granulation
in response counsel again distinguished the prior_art on the basis that no reaction was taught the examiner alleges that gu et al
renders obvious the process of making moexipril_magnesium and that gu discloses a process of making a moexipril alkaline salt by allegedly reacting moexipril_hydrochloride with an alkaline stabilizing agent
respectfully no such reaction is taught
the components are merely combined and any reaction is insignificant to the desired end result
id.at 12223 emphasis in original
dr._shermans counsel once more referred the examiner to the product_monograph for univasc and the orange_book and argued that univasc includes magnesium_oxide` unreacted but combined'
id.at 12224

unconvinced the examiner issued a third and final_rejection on obviousness grounds based on gu and the ¡¬450_patent finding that the neutralization taught by the cited references constituted a reaction
dr._shermans counsel appealed the final_rejection to the ptos board of appeals arguing that the cited references merely taught combining moexipril_hydrochloride with an alkaline stabilizing agent
id.at 12249
counsel again referred the board to the product_monograph for univasc and the orange_book and represented that univasc made according to the ¡¬450_patent contained` unreacted but combined' *1358 moexipril_hydrochloride and magnesium_oxide
id.at 12251

at the direction of dr._sherman counsel also submitted the expert_declaration of dr. michael lipp who reinforced the representations regarding the prior_art
specifically dr._lipp explained that the function of a stabilizer is to inhibit or prevent reactions that would degrade the active ingredient and that a stabilizer needs to be unreacted to perform this function
see id.at 12288
according to dr._lipp a person of skill in the art would therefore not expect a reaction to occur between the ace_inhibitor and the alkaline_stabilizer disclosed in the ¡¬450_patent
id.at 12289
dr._lipp relied on univasc to support his conclusion an additional example particularly relevant to the matter at hand is the unvascthe_r [ sic ] moexipril_hydrochloride formulation..
the product monograph for the unvasc [ sic ] moexipril_hydrochloride formulation lists moexipril_hydrochloride as being present in the final formulation in addition to magnesium_oxide as an alkaline_stabilizer as per the teachings of the ¡¬450_patent which is listed on the fda_orange_book for this formulation
as a result in my opinion a skilled formulator reading harris et al
would not expect a reaction to occur between an alkaline or saccharide stabilizer and an ace_inhibitor_drug in the formulations disclosed therein
id.at 12288-89

in a subsequent telephonic interview the examiner and dr._shermans counsel agreed to incorporate into claim 1 a limitation requiring` greater than 80 %' conversion of the moexipril or moexipril_acid_addition_salt to moexipril_magnesium
as a result the examiner allowed the ¡¬556_patent_claims on april_20,_2004
as reasons for allowance the examiner stated the primary reason for allowance is that the prior_art does not disclose nor fairly suggest a process of making a pharmaceutical composition comprising moexipril_magnesium comprising the step of reacting moexipril or an acid_addition_salt thereof with an alkaline_magnesium_compound so as to convert greater than 80 % of the moexipril or moexipril_acid_addition_salt to moexipril_magnesium
rather the prior_art teaches that only a portion of drug if any may be converted to the alkaline salt and that the stable product results entirely or primarily not from conversion to alkaline salts but from stabilization of the moexipril_hydrochloride by the presence of the alkaline stabilizing compound in the final_product
id.at 12399 emphasis added

d. district court proceedings
apotex filed suit on april_20,_2012 accusing ucb of infringing claims 8-12 of the ¡¬556_patent by manufacturing and selling univasc and uniretic as well as generic versions thereof
prior to conducting a jury_trial on infringement and invalidity the district_court held a three-day bench trial on claim_construction and ucbs equitable defenses

the district_court ruled that the ¡¬556_patent is unenforceable due to dr._shermans inequitable_conduct before the pto
specifically the district_court found that dr._sherman was aware that univasc was made according to his claimed process concealed this knowledge from the pto and misrepresented the nature of univasc and the prior_art through his counsels arguments and dr._lipps declaration
the district_court also found that dr._sherman withheld relevant_prior_art and submitted results of experiments that he never conducted

*1359 the district_court relied on several pieces of evidence in finding that dr._sherman was aware that univasc involved a reaction
for instance dr._sherman conceded during trial that before filing the ¡¬556_patent_application he had a` strong_suspicion' and a` belief' that univasc was made according to his claimed process
also on the same day the application was filed dr._sherman conducted tests comparing univasc to an apotex moexipril product with no alkaline_stabilizer
in his handwritten notes dr._sherman concluded that the apotex product was` much less stable than the magnesium_salt' implying at least a suspicion that univasc consisted of moexipril_magnesium
about a month later dr._shermans suspicion was confirmed by two apotex scientists who produced a detailed mass spectrometry report on univasc and concluded that moexipril in univasc is` mainly present' as moexipril_magnesium

the court also found that dr._sherman was aware of and involved in all decisions regarding prosecution of the ¡¬556_patent_application
the court noted that dr._sherman is highly familiar with patent prosecution and patent enforcement litigation
although dr._sherman attempted to disclaim knowledge of the components of univasc the prior_art and the statements made to the pto by his counsel the district_court did not find his testimony to be credible
the district_court observed that dr._sherman selectively displayed at trial a lack of memory and responsibility that led the court to conclude he was not a credible witness

the district_court also found that dr._sherman made several misrepresentations to the pto regarding the prior_art
in particular dr._sherman misrepresented the nature of univasc and the ¡¬450_patent by asserting that the moexipril_hydrochloride in univasc was not reacted but merely combined with an alkaline_magnesium_compound
the district_court also found that dr._sherman in the specification and through dr._lipps declaration mischaracterized the gu_article by asserting that only a minor portion of the drug if any is converted to moexipril_magnesium
lastly the district_court found that dr._sherman lied in the ¡¬556_patent_application by including certain examples of experiments that were never conducted
the court noted that each example is written in the past tense as if it had occurred but dr._sherman admitted at trial that the experiments were made up in his head

the district_court further concluded that dr._lipp was only hired to add legitimacy to dr._shermans misrepresentations
the court found that dr._sherman failed to inform dr._lipp of the true facts about univasc and shielded him from the truth which resulted in a declaration that dr._sherman knowingly submitted to the pto to perpetuate his mischaracterizations of the prior_art
dr._lipp testified that he was specifically asked to limit his discussions to only the documents provided by apotex which did not include any information regarding the tests conducted on univasc or dr._shermans knowledge of the product

in addition to the misrepresentations the district_court found that dr._sherman withheld relevant_prior_art from the pto
specifically pct application no
wo 99/62560 titled` stabilization of quinapril using magnesium oxide'` the ¡¬560_pct' was cited by the pto in a 2003 office action for u.s
application no._10 /060,191` the ¡¬191_application' of which dr._sherman is also an inventor
the ¡¬560_pct relates to a method for stabilizing an ace_inhibitor_drug like quinapril using magnesium_oxide and the examiner interpreted this reference as disclosing a reaction between a hydrochloride *1360 salt and an alkaline_base
given the similarities between the ¡¬191_application and the ¡¬556_patent and dr._shermans experience the district_court found that dr._sherman would have known about the ¡¬560_pct and understood its relevance to the prosecution of the ¡¬556_patent
the ¡¬560_pct however was never disclosed to the examiner handling the prosecution of the ¡¬556_patent

the district_court found that the foregoing combined misrepresentations and withholding of prior_art were material to the prosecution of the ¡¬556_patent_application
based on the examiners reasons for allowance the district_court concluded that the examiner adopted dr._shermans repeated misrepresentations verbatim and would not have allowed the claims had he been aware that univasc contained moexipril_magnesium
the district_court also found the ¡¬560_pcts disclosure of a reaction between a hydrochloride salt and an alkaline_base to be material because of the similarities between the ¡¬191_application and the ¡¬556_patent and the fact that the ¡¬560_pct discloses the four basic steps of wet_granulation recited in claim 8 of the ¡¬556_patent
although the district_court found that the falsification of examples in the ¡¬556_patent was alone not sufficiently material it nonetheless added to the materiality determination when viewed in conjunction with other misrepresentations and omissions

in the alternative the district_court found that a finding of but-for materiality was not necessary because dr._sherman engaged in egregious_misconduct during prosecution of the ¡¬556_patent_application
in addition to the various misrepresentations made by dr._sherman the district_court observed that dr._sherman abused the patent system by targeting a competitors existing and widely available product and seeking to obtain a patent on it through lies and deception for the purpose of suing that competitor

regarding intent the district_court found that the single most reasonable_inference that could be drawn from the evidence was that dr._sherman intended to deceive the pto
the court based its determination on dr._shermans overall pattern of misconduct and his poor credibility at trial
the district_court concluded that dr._sherman intentionally violated his duty of candor not only by making repeated misrepresentations to the pto during prosecution of the ¡¬ 556 patent but also by including experiment results in the specification as if the experiments had actually been conducted and by purposely shielding an expert from relevant information to obtain a declaration that misinformed and led the examiner to finally allow the claims
the court also found that dr._shermans demeanor and evasive testimony at trial were evidence of his intent to deceive the pto

the district_court therefore held the ¡¬556_patent unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct
additionally the court ruled in favor of ucb on its judicial_estoppel and laches equitable defenses indefiniteness and claim_construction
the court entered final judgment against apotex on september 19 2013
the jury_trial on infringement and invalidity was never held

apotex filed a timely appeal
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

discussion
we affirm the district_courts holding that the ¡¬556_patent is unenforceable due to dr._shermans inequitable_conduct
the district_courts findings regarding materiality and intent are not clearly erroneous and its ultimate determination that dr._sherman breached his duty of candor *1361 good_faith and honesty before the pto was not an abuse of discretion.2

a. materiality
clear and convincing_evidence demonstrates that dr._sherman engaged in material misconduct
first dr._sherman was actively involved in the prosecution of the ¡¬556_patent and instigated the representations made on his behalf by his counsel and dr._lipp
the ¡¬556_patents specification written by dr._sherman omits important details regarding the prior_art that were determined to have been known to him
record evidence shows that dr._shermans counsel was in constant communication with him during prosecution and kept him appraised of actions taken by the pto and arguments made in response including the representation that the prior_art did not involve a reaction
indeed dr._sherman directly instructed his counsel to continue pressing those arguments and to bolster them through an expert_declaration
we see no reason to disturb the district_courts finding that dr._shermans attempt to disclaim knowledge and responsibility at trial was not credible.3 the district_courts finding that dr._sherman is responsible for the alleged misconduct is not clearly erroneous

second dr._sherman made affirmative misrepresentations of material_facts
apotexs internal tests showed that moexipril in univasc is` mainly present' as moexipril_magnesium
although the tests were conducted in 2001 before the pto issued its first rejection of the ¡¬556_patent_claims dr._sherman repeatedly asserted before the pto that the process of the ¡¬450_patent used to manufacture univasc did not involve a reaction that would produce moexipril_magnesium
years after issuance of the patent as part of its infringement case apotex confirmed through nuclear magnetic resonance nmr testing that univasc indeed contains more than 80 % moexipril_magnesium
dr._shermans assertions during prosecution regarding the absence of moexipril_magnesium in univasc were false

third dr._shermans misconduct was` but-for material' to the issuance of the ¡¬556_patent
the examiners rejections were based on the very same prior_art that is the subject of dr._shermans misrepresentations
the examiner allowed the claims only after being convinced that the prior_art moexipril_tablets were stable not from conversion to moexipril_magnesium i.e. a reaction but because the alkaline_stabilizer was combined and remained present in the final_product without reacting with the moexipril
see j.a.at 12399
dr._lipps declaration was instrumental in this regard
the examiners erroneous belief regarding the prior_art corresponds precisely with dr._shermans repeated misrepresentations made through his counsel and the hired expert
we conclude that the pto would not have allowed the ¡¬556_patent but for dr._shermans misconduct

to be clear we agree with apotex that dr._sherman had no duty to disclose his own suspicions or beliefs regarding the prior_art.4 there is nothing wrong with advocating in good_faith a reasonable interpretation of the teachings of the prior *1362 art.5 the misconduct at issue however goes beyond failing to disclose a personal belief or alternative interpretations of the prior_art ; here dr._sherman affirmatively and knowingly misrepresented material_facts regarding the prior_art

because we affirm the district_courts finding that the misrepresentations regarding the prior_art were but-for material we need not decide whether dr._shermans conduct rises to the level of egregious_misconduct such that materiality could have been presumed.6 we also need not address the materiality of dr._shermans failure to disclose the ¡¬560_pct or his falsification of examples in the ¡¬556_patent
we note however that dr._shermans actions at a minimum come close to the type of affirmative misconduct that in therasense we held could justify finding inequitable_conduct without showing but-for materiality
we find particularly significant and inexcusable the fact that dr._sherman arranged for the preparation and submission of an expert_declaration containing false statements instrumental to issuance of the patent

b
intent
we affirm the district_courts finding that clear and convincing_evidence establishes dr._shermans intent to deceive the pto
the district_court did not clearly err in finding that dr._sherman knew or at least had a strong_suspicion that he was seeking to patent the very same process used to obtain an already existing and widely available drug
as of the filing of the ¡¬556_patent_application dr._sherman was aware that some of the assertions he made in the specification regarding the prior_art were at least misleadingly incomplete if not plainly inaccurate
additionally dr._sherman admitted that he never performed the experiments described in the ¡¬556_patent and yet he drafted the examples in the specification entirely in past-tense language
see ¡¬556_patent_col. 5_l._1 -col. 6_l._16
dr._sherman was also aware that additional misrepresentations were made on his behalf to the pto and directed his counsel to bolster those misrepresentations by procuring and submitting the declaration of an expert who was deliberately shielded from the truth

apotex argues that merely advocating a particular interpretation of the prior_art can not support an inference of deceptive_intent
but dr._shermans statements were not mere advocacy for a preferred interpretation ; his statements were factual in nature and contrary to the true information he had in his possession
it is immaterial that at that time dr._sherman had no direct knowledge of ucbs actual manufacturing process or had determined the exact amount of moexipril_magnesium present in univasc
he knew enough to recognize that he was crossing the line from legitimate advocacy to genuine misrepresentation of material_facts
in the aggregate dr._shermans conduct evidences a pattern of lack of candor
we agree with the district_court that deceptive_intent is the single most reasonable_inference that can be drawn from the evidence.7

*1363 conclusion
the district_court did not abuse its discretion in holding the ¡¬556_patent unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct
in view of this we need not reach the district_courts rulings on claim_construction indefiniteness laches and judicial_estoppel
the judgment in favor of ucb is hereby
