background
elk corporation of dallas elk brought a patent infringement action against defendants gaf building corporation of america building_materials_corporation of america building_materials_corporation of america_d/b/a gaf_materials_corporation and gaf_materials_corporation collectively gaf alleging that gaf infringed elks144_patent
gaf counterclaimed by filing for a declaratory judgment that elks design_patent is unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct by the patent applicants and their patent_attorney in the prosecution of the patent

elk and gaf are manufacturers of roofing_shingles
in 1975 gaf obtained a patent u.s._patent_no._3921,358 the bettoli_patent for two-ply composite_roofing_shingles which are often referred to as` laminated_shingles'
gaf granted licenses under the bettoli_patent to many manufacturers including elk to manufacture and sell two-ply composite_roofing_shingles
in the late 1980s four inventors some of whom were elk employees began developing a two-ply composite roofing_shingle based on the bettoli_patent that utilized striations of shading to simulate the appearance of depth

in anticipation of applying for a design_patent on the new_shingle casimir weaver one of the inventors arranged for a patentability search on the newly developed roofing_shingle
in his letter requesting the search mr._weaver acknowledged the similarity of the new design to the shingles disclosed in the bettoli_patent the enclosed sketch describes this [ new ] products appearance
this shingles construction is similar to the one described in bettolis patent no._3921,358 which is also enclosed

a search was made and mr._weaver was sent a search_report
one of the patents discussed in the search_report was u.s._patent no._2036,329 the giles_patent
after reviewing the search_report mr._weaver wrote a memo to a co-inventor pointing out that the giles_patent was` [ o ] f special interest'
the search_report and mr._weavers memo were forwarded to a patent_attorney at baker & botts l.l.p.2

*30 during the prosecution of the144_patent a number of prior_art_patents covering different shingles or parts of shingles including u.s._patent
no
des
309,027 the noone_patent u.s._patent_no._3613,328 the morgan_patent and u.s._patent
no._2253,652 the ritter_patent were disclosed to the patent and trademark_office pto
neither the noone_patent the morgan_patent nor the ritter_patent made mention of either the bettoli_patent or the giles_patent
the bettoli and giles_patents themselves were never disclosed to the pto despite the fact that it was the standard practice of the patent_attorney who completed the prosecution of the144_patent to disclose all of the prior_art cited in a search_report
in contrast during the prosecution of a continuation of the144_patent both the bettoli and giles_patents were disclosed to the pto

in its counterclaim gaf alleged that the applicants had committed fraud on the pto by various means including by intentionally withholding the bettoli and giles_patents and by proffering arguments to the examiner during the prosecution of the144_patent that could not have been made had the bettoli and giles_patents been disclosed
in addition gaf alleged that the applicants had intentionally withheld their knowledge of a commercialized bettoli-type shingle known as the gs_high_sierra
the district_court found inter alia that the bettoli and giles_patents and information about the gs_high_sierra were material that the applicants had knowledge of the materiality of the patents and information and that they withheld the patents and information from the pto with an intent to deceive
see elk_corp. v. building materials_corp. no._394-cv-0249-p slip op.at 10 14 27-28 1997_wl_796004_(n.d.tex._oct._10,_1997)
in addition the district_court found that in order to overcome an initial rejection the applicants had made arguments concerning the prior_art cited by the examiner that could not have been made had they disclosed the far more material bettoli and giles_patents
see id.at 20
in light of all the circumstances the district_court concluded that the applicants conduct was so culpable that elks144_patent should not be enforced
see id.at 28
elk appeals the district_courts final judgment against it

discussion
applicants for patents including their patent_attorneys are required to prosecute patent applications in the pto with candor good faith and honesty
see molins plc v. textron inc. 48_f.3d_1172 1178 33_uspq2d_1823 1826 fed.cir.1995 ; see also 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56
a breach of this duty may constitute inequitable_conduct
although the district_court considered multiple allegations that the applicants had breached their duty of candor we focus on the most pertinent allegations - those that involve the withholding of the bettoli and giles_patents

inequitable conduct due to failure to disclose material information must be proven by clear and convincing evidence of 1 prior_art that was material ; 2 knowledge chargeable to an applicant of that prior_art and of its materiality ; and 3 failure of the applicant to disclose the art resulting from an intent to mislead the pto
see molins 48 f.3d at 1178 33 uspq2d at 1827 ; fmc corp. v. manitowoc co. 835_f.2d_1411 1415 5_uspq2d_1112 1115 fed.cir.1987
such proof of inequitable_conduct may be rebutted by a showing that a the prior_art was not material ; b if the prior_art was material a showing that the applicant did not know of that art ; c if the applicant did know of that art a showing that the applicant did not know of its materiality ; or d a showing that the applicants failure to disclose the art did not result from an intent to mislead the pto
see id

because inequitable_conduct is an equitable issue committed to the discretion of the district_court we review a determination of inequitable_conduct for abuse of discretion
see kingsdown med consultants ltd. v. hollister inc. 863_f.2d_867 876 9_uspq2d_1384 1392 fed.cir.1988 en banc
we may reverse a district_courts decision on inequitable_conduct only if the decision is based upon` clearly erroneous findings of fact or on a misapplication or misinterpretation of applicable law or evidences a clear error of judgment on the part of the district_court'
id
; molins 48 f.3d at 1178 33 uspq2d at 1827
the district_courts factual *31 determinations of materiality and intent are subject to the clearly erroneous standard and will not be disturbed unless this court has a` definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed'
id

on the question of whether the prior_art bettoli and giles_patents were material elk argues that the district_court erred in finding the bettoli and giles_patents material because they were merely cumulative of certain patents that were disclosed to the pto during the prosecution of the144_patent
according to elk the bettoli_patent was merely cumulative of the morgan and noone_patents and the giles_patent was merely cumulative of the ritter and noone_patents

information is` material' when there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable examiner would have considered the information important in deciding whether to allow the application to issue as a patent
see molins 48 f.3d at 1179 33 uspq2d at 1827
however an otherwise material reference need not be disclosed if it is merely cumulative of or less_material than other references already disclosed
see halliburton co. v. schlumberger technology corp. 925_f.2d_1435 1440 17_uspq2d_1834 1839 fed.cir.1991 ; baxter int l inc. v. mcgaw inc. 149_f.3d_1321 1328 47_uspq2d_1225 1229 fed.cir.1998

differences between the bettoli_patent and the morgan and noone_patents support the district_courts finding that the bettoli_patent was material
for instance the morgan_patent which predates the bettoli_patent discloses a different type of shingle a single-ply strip_shingle than the two-ply composite_shingle disclosed in the bettoli_patent
in addition the noone_patent a design_patent covering the ornamental design for only the tab portion of a single-ply strip_shingle could not be cumulative of the bettoli_patent which describes an entire two-ply composite_shingle
because the morgan and noone_patents disclose a different shingle the bettoli_patent is not cumulative of those patents
in addition the bettoli_patent is not less_material than the morgan or noone_patents because the design claimed in the144_patent is for a two-ply composite_shingle not a single-ply strip_shingle
thus the district_court did not clearly err in finding that the bettoli_patent was the most material prior_art and that the bettoli_patent was not cumulative of the morgan and noone_patents which were cited to the pto

similarly differences between the giles_patent and the ritter and noone_patents support the district_courts finding that the giles_patent was material
the giles_patent discloses shingles with blended horizontal shadings across each simulated shingle whereas the ritter_patent discloses a discrete continuous dark line across the tops of shingles
the noone_patent is also different from the giles_patent because it teaches discrete vertical zones of shading
thus because neither the noone_patent nor the ritter_patent discloses the same shading as the giles_patent the giles_patent can not be cumulative of those patents
in addition the giles_patent is not less_material than the ritter or noone_patents because the design claimed in the144_patent for laminated_shingles with three horizontal striations that appear to blend into each other across a simulated shingle is more similar to the blended shading of shingles in the giles_patent than the shadings in the ritter or noone_patents
thus the district_court did not clearly err in finding that the giles_patent was material and was not cumulative of the ritter and noone_patents which were cited to the pto

besides the prior_art disclosed to the pto the district_court also considered other circumstances relating to the materiality of the bettoli and giles_patents and the applicants knowledge of those patents
with respect to the bettoli_patent there was evidence that the applicants new_shingle design was an improved bettoli-type laminated roofing_shingle ; that mr._weavers letter requesting a search_report revealed that the applicants knew that the new_shingle was very similar to the shingle disclosed in the bettoli_patent ; and that the testimony of the prosecuting attorney indicated that there was a strong likelihood the prosecuting attorney also knew of the materiality of the bettoli_patent
these factors further support the district_courts findings of the high level of materiality of the bettoli_patent and the applicants knowledge of that materiality

*32 with regard to the giles_patent additional support for the district_courts findings of materiality and knowledge are found in the search_report and in mr._weavers memo to a co-inventor
the search_report which was reviewed by both mr._weaver and the prosecuting attorney listed and discussed the giles_patent
in addition mr._weavers memo contained his admission that the giles_patent was important
based upon the foregoing the district_courts findings of materiality and knowledge of materiality of the bettoli and giles_patents were not clearly erroneous

with regard to the intent of the applicants to deceive the pto our precedent has recognized that intent need not and rarely can be proven by direct evidence
see merck & co. v. danbury pharmacal inc. 873_f.2d_1418 1422 10_uspq2d_1682 1686 fed.cir.1989
rather this element of inequitable_conduct must generally be inferred from the facts and circumstances surrounding the applicants overall conduct
see paragon podiatry laboratory inc. v. klm laboratories inc. 984_f.2d_1182 1190 25_uspq2d_1561 1567 fed.cir.1993 ; merck 873 f.2d at 1422 10 uspq2d at 1686
moreover we have recognized that the more material the omission the less the degree of intent that must be shown to reach a conclusion of inequitable_conduct
see critikon inc. v. becton dickinson vascular access inc. 120_f.3d_1253 1256 43_uspq2d_1666 1668 fed.cir.1997 ; akzo n.v. v. united states int l trade comm n 808_f.2d_1471 1481-82 1_uspq2d_1241 1247 fed.cir.1986
in light of all the circumstances of the case as described above we can not say that the district_courts finding of intent to mislead was clearly erroneous

finally given the factual findings on which the district_courts judgment stands we can not conclude that the district_court abused its discretion in determining that the behavior of the applicants and their prosecuting attorney constituted inequitable_conduct
accordingly the district_courts judgment that elks144_patent is unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct is
