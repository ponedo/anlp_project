background
gfi filed an application on january 3 1991 for a patent on a sectional_sofa in which a pair of reclining_seats on the same side of a wedge is separated by a fixed console which contains the control means for the reclining_seats
gfi then filed a petition to make special to expedite its consideration
after an initial rejection gfi met with the examiner on june_12,_1991
the application issued as the ¡¬244_patent on november 12 1991

during the prosecution of the ¡¬244_patent gfi entered discussions with walter durling a furniture designer from mississippi who designed and built a loveseat-like unit consisting of two recliners joined by a middle_console
durling filed a patent_application on this design two months before the ¡¬244_patent_application was filed
the discussions between gfi and durling centered on extracting information from durling regarding his conception and reduction to practice of the design
the application did not specify the location of the recliner_controls but sproule the named inventor of the ¡¬244_patent saw a model of the durling furniture in late october or early november of 1990 that had console-mounted controls
durling offered to exchange his conception information for similar information about the conception and reduction to practice of the invention underlying the ¡¬244_patent ; gfi refused
in 1997 gfi brought suit for patent infringement against franklin astro parkhill and washington collectively` franklin'
the defenses of inequitable_conduct obviousness laches equitable estoppel and patent misuse were tried to the court in a non-jury trial

discussion
first we address gfis claim that the district_court forced it to disclose privileged_information to franklin
we apply regional circuit law to procedural questions that are not themselves substantive patent law issues so long as they do not 1 pertain to patent law flex-foot inc. v. crp inc. 238_f.3d_1362 1365 57_uspq2d_1635 1637 fed.cir.2001` [ w ] e will apply our own law to both substantive and procedural issuesintimately involved in the substance of enforcement of the patent right` citation omitted 2 bear an essential relationship to matters committed to our exclusive control by statute or 3 clearly implicate the jurisprudential responsibilities of this court in a field within its exclusive jurisdiction midwest indus. inc. v. karavan trailers inc. 175_f.3d_1356 1359 50_uspq2d_1672 1675 fed.cir.1999 en banc in relevant part
because waiver by the disclosure of privileged material does not meet any of these criteria we apply the law of the fifth_circuit to our review of the district_courts judgment
dorf & stanton comm. inc. v. molson breweries 100_f.3d_919 922 40_uspq2d_1761 1764 fed.cir.1996

the fifth_circuit reviews a district_courts ruling on waiver of attorney-client_privilege for clear_error as a question of fact and reviews conclusions of law de novo
united_states v. robinson 121_f.3d_971 974 5th cir.1997
`` it is vital to a claim of privilege that the communication have been made and maintained in confidence'
united_states v. pipkins 528_f.2d_559 563 5th cir.1976
a client *1273 waives the attorney-client_privilege by failing to assert it when confidential information is sought in legal proceedings
nguyen v. excel corp. 197_f.3d_200 206 5th cir.1999
inquiry into the general_nature of the legal services provided by counsel does not necessitate an assertion of the privilege because the general_nature of services is not protected
id
further inquiry into the substance of the clients and attorneys discussions does implicate the privilege and an assertion is required to preserve it
id
when a party voluntarily waives attorney-client_privilege that waiver extends to all communications pertaining to the subject matter of the communications
id.at 207 a client implicitly waives the attorney-client_privilege by testifying about portions of the attorney-client communication
)

franklin claims that gfi waived the privilege when its patent_attorney testified in an earlier trial gentry_gallery inc. v. berkline corp. 939_f.supp._98 41_uspq2d_1345_(d.mass.1996)` berkline' about the privileged_information and when it failed to timely submit detailed privilege logs in accordance with local rules to permit franklin to challenge its assertion of privilege
the district_court properly found that gfi waived privilege when its patent_attorney testified in the berkline litigation about his state of mind knowledge of prior_art and communications with his client
on cross-examination he discussed his conversations with sproule regarding the duty of disclosure discussions they had prior to an interview with the pto and various items of prior_art sproule had or had not told him about
we see no error in the district_courts order to gfi to release the allegedly privileged_information

to prevail on its defense of inequitable_conduct franklin must prove by clear and convincing_evidence that gfi withheld material_information from the pto and the information was withheld with intent to deceive the pto
purdue pharma l.p. v. boehringer ingelheim gmbh 237_f.3d_1359 1366 57_uspq2d_1647 1652 fed.cir.2001 to prove inequitable_conduct in the prosecution of a patent requires evidence of affirmative misrepresentations of a material fact failure to disclose material_information or submission of false material_information coupled with an intent to deceive
we review the district_courts ultimate determination of inequitable_conduct under an abuse of discretion standard
kolmes v. world fibers corp. 107_f.3d_1534 1541 41_uspq2d_1829 1834 fed.cir.1997`
'we accordingly will not simply substitute our judgment for that of the trial court in relation to inequitable_conduct
`` purdue 237 f.3d at 1366 57 uspq2d at 1652 quoting kingsdown med
consultants v. hollister inc. 863_f.2d_867 876 9_uspq2d_1384 1392 fed.cir.1988 en banc

inequitable conduct entails a two-step analysis first a determination of whether the withheld reference meets a threshold level of materiality and intent to mislead and second a weighing of the materiality and intent in light of all the circumstances to determine whether the applicants conduct is so culpable that the patent should be unenforceable
baxter int l inc. v. mcgaw inc. 149_f.3d_1321 1327 47_uspq2d_1225 1228-29 fed.cir.1998
both intent and materiality are questions of fact reviewed for clear_error
id
`` the more material the omission the less culpable the intent required and vice versa'
halliburton_co. v. schlumberger_tech corp. 925_f.2d_1435 1439 17_uspq2d_1834 1838 fed.cir.1991
the challenged conduct must be sufficient to require a finding of deceitful intent in light of all the circumstances
kingsdown 863 f.2d at 873 9 uspq2d at 1389

*1274 gfi does not dispute that the five references relied upon by the district_court in its inequitable_conduct determination were not before the examiner but argues that none of them were material and in any case that franklin did not prove deceptive_intent by clear and convincing_evidence
materiality is not limited to prior_art but instead embraces any information that a reasonable_examiner would be substantially likely to consider important in deciding whether to allow an application to issue as a patent
akron polymer container corp. v. exxel container inc. 148_f.3d_1380 1382 47_uspq2d_1533 1534 fed.cir.1998
however a patentee need not cite an otherwise material reference to the pto if that reference is merely cumulative or is less material than other references already before the examiner
halliburton_co. v. schlumberger_tech corp. 925_f.2d_1435 1440 17_uspq2d_1834 1839 fed.cir.1991

the district_court properly found the durling_references material because they contained the elements of two recliners joined by a middle_console albeit in a loveseat and not a sectional and had console-mounted controls on the model viewed by sproule
gfi argues that durling can not be material because it is not prior_art
that is not the law and even if it were the very essence of the discussions between gfi and durling were motivated by an effort to determine priority of invention between the ¡¬244_patent and durlings patent_application
the district_court made no finding as to priority and we will not make that determination in the first instance on appeal
in any case it was incumbent on gfi to disclose the potential priority conflict to the examiner and not to unilaterally make a determination that durling was not prior_art
labounty mfg. inc. v. united_states int l trade comm n 958_f.2d_1066 1076 22_uspq2d_1025 1033 fed.cir.1992 it is axiomatic that` [ c ] lose cases should be resolved by disclosure not unilaterally by applicant`
even if the prior_art dispute had been resolved in the manner asserted by gfi durlings status as prior_art is not dispositive of its materiality because a reasonable_examiner would have been substantially likely to find important the two recliners separated by a center console of durlings patent_application and the center-mounted console of the durling model viewed by sproule prior to the filing of the application that issued as the ¡¬244_patent
the durling_references were not cumulative because no reference before the examiner disclosed this combination of required elements

as we have noted before the facts in inequitable_conduct cases rarely include direct evidence of admitted deceitful conduct
molins plc v. textron inc. 48_f.3d_1172 1180 33_uspq2d_1823 1828-29 fed.cir.1995
the intent element of the offense is therefore in the main proven by inferences drawn from facts with the collection of inferences permitting a confident judgment that deceit has occurred
akron 148 f.3d at 1382 47 uspq2d at 1535.`
'however materiality does not presume intent which is a separate and essential component of inequitable_conduct
`` manville sales corp. v. paramount sys. inc. 917_f.2d_544 552 16_uspq2d_1587 1593 fed.cir.1990 quoting allen organ co. v. kimball int l inc. 839_f.2d_1556 1567 5_uspq2d_1769 1778 fed.cir.1988
when examining intent to deceive a court must weigh all the evidence including evidence of good faith
gambro lundia ab v. baxter healthcare corp. 110_f.3d_1573 1580 42_uspq2d_1378 1384 fed.cir.1997

the strongest case for deceptive_intent are the durling_references
it is undisputed that gfi was aware of the references
gfi possessed a copy of the durling patent_application sent to it by *1275 durling and sproule had seen the model with console-mounted controls prior to the filing of the ¡¬244_patent_application
gfi also entered into active negotiations with durling to obtain priority information to assess the need for a license from durling and the ability to obtain a patent on sproules concept
despite their knowledge and the discussions conducted during the pendency of the ¡¬244_patent_application no disclosure was made to the pto
we have held deceptive_intent to be shown where a patentee withheld references and made an argument for patentability that could not have been made had the art been disclosed
labounty 958 f.2d at 1076 22 uspq2d at 1032
here gfi specifically distinguished the disclosed references by arguing that none of them had console-mounted controls despite sproules prior knowledge that durling had built a model with center-mounted recliner_controls prior to the filing of the ¡¬244_patent_application
beyond its arguments that the durling_references were not material which we have rejected gfi does little more than deny any intent to deceive the patent and trademark office
the district_court did not clearly err in finding that the threshold deceptive_intent was proven by clear and convincing_evidence for the durling_references

no single factor or combination of factors can be said always to require an inference of intent to mislead
yet a patentee facing a high level of materiality and clear proof that it knew or should have known of that materiality can expect to find it difficult to establish` subjective good faith' sufficient to prevent the drawing of an inference of intent to mislead
critikon inc. v. becton dickinson vascular access inc. 120_f.3d_1253 1257 43_uspq2d_1666 1669 fed.cir.1997
a mere denial of intent to mislead which would defeat every effort to establish inequitable_conduct will not suffice
fmc corp. v. manitowoc co. 835_f.2d_1411 1416 5_uspq2d_1112 1116 fed.cir.1987
we see no abuse of discretion in the district_courts conclusion that gfis conduct was sufficient to warrant a conclusion of unenforceability in light of all the circumstances kingsdown 863 f.2d at 873 9 uspq2d at 1389 especially considering the high degree of materiality of the durling_references halliburton 925 f.2d at 1439 17 uspq2d at 1838
because the failure to disclose the durling_references alone supports unenforceability of the claims of the ¡¬244_patent we need not address the remaining references
because the ¡¬244_patent is unenforceable for gfis inequitable_conduct we do not reach the remaining claims regarding infringement which are moot

conclusion
accordingly the judgments of the united_states_district_court for the northern_district of mississippi are affirmed

affirmed
