opinion
newman circuit_judge
orexo_ab and orexo_us_inc. collectively` orexo' appeal the decision of the united_states_district_court for the district of delaware holding claims 1 3-6 and 8-10 of u.s._patent_no._8940,330` the330_patent` invalid on the ground of obviousness.1 the330_patent entitled` abuse-resistant pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of opioid dependence' claims a product having the brand name zubsolvthe_r approved by the fda for treatment of opioid_dependence

actavis_elizabeth_llc` actavis' filed an abbreviated new drug application` anda' for a generic counter-part of zubsolv accompanied by a paragraph iv certification leading to this hatch-waxman litigation in accordance with 21 u.s.c.¡± 355 j and 35 u.s.c.¡± 271 e 2 a
two orexo patents were challenged by actavis but u.s._patent_no._8454,996` the996_patent` entitled` pharmaceutical composition *1267 for the treatment of acute disorders' which was held valid in the district_court is not involved in this appeal

we reverse the judgment of invalidity of the330_patent for we conclude that obviousness was not proved by clear and convincing_evidence

background
a
the330_patent
the330_patent specification explains that opioid-based pharmaceutical products intended for the relief of pain have become a source of addiction dependency and abuse
treatment for opioid_addiction includes a protocol called` substitution_therapy' where partial opioid_agonists2 that have higher binding affinities at opioid receptors but produce lowered dependency than full agonists like heroin can lead to cessation of addiction by relieving the opioid craving
the prior_art shows use for this purpose of the partial agonist buprenorphine administered in sublingual_tablets and in oral_films

the330_patent explains that while buprenorphine has less narcotic effect than a full opioid addicts were known to dissolve the buprenorphine from the substitution_therapy tablet and inject the dissolved buprenorphine intravenously to achieve an enhanced opioid effect
to counteract this abuse it was known to combine buprenorphine with the opioid antagonist3 naloxone in substitution_therapy

it was known that formulations containing buprenorphine to naloxone at a ratio of 4:1 provide the therapeutically optimal balance for sublingual treatment
naloxone has poor transmucosal bioavailability so that if the mixture is taken in tablet_form as directed the buprenorphine will act as intended to treat opioid_dependence with little_interference from the naloxone
however if the tablet is dissolved and injected the naloxone will antagonize the effects of the buprenorphine resulting in withdrawal symptoms and thus deterring abuse of the formulation
the 4:1 ratio provides for appropriate pharmacological amounts of naloxone to deter abuse when injected but does not interfere with buprenorphine when taken in tablet_form
'330_patent col._2,_ll._13-22 ; id. col._9,_ll._37-50
however naloxones` functional blockade of buprenorphines action is also only partial and is short-lived in its nature' id. col._2,_ll._23-25 and there was a continuing need for improvement in substitution_therapy formulations

the330_patent is for a sublingual_tablet_formulation that is less subject to abuse
the formulation enhances the agonist effectiveness of buprenorphine permitting a reduced amount of buprenorphine in the tablet and thus reducing the amount available on dissolving and injecting the product
in this formulation microparticles of buprenorphine are adhered to the surface of carrier_particles of citric_acid and the formulation also contains naloxone in the 4:1 ratio
the330_patent explains that the buprenorphine in the microparticles acts *1268 with little_interference from the naloxone but if the tablet is dissolved in water for injection into the bloodstream the naloxone will also be dissolved and will antagonize buprenorphines effects

all parties agree that the product in the330_patent provides improved_treatment of opioid_dependence as compared with the prior_art
the330_patent specification includes data from clinical_trials comparing the related sublingual product suboxonethe_r
patent example 2 shows a 66 %_improvement in bioavailability of buprenorphine and patent examples 7_and_8 show bioequivalent results for a sublingual_tablet containing 29 % less buprenorphine than in suboxone_tablets

actavis does not dispute the improvement or its value in treatment of addiction
rather actavis argues that this formulation is obvious based on a combination of references and that improved function and use are irrelevant if the product is obvious
this theory is flawed for an unobvious improvement in properties or use is highly relevant to patentability of a new product

claims 1_and_6 were deemed representative 1
a tablet composition suitable for sublingual administration comprising microparticles of a pharmacologically-effective_amount of buprenorphine or a pharmaceutically-acceptable_salt thereof presented upon the surface of carrier_particles wherein microparticles of buprenorphine or a pharmaceutically acceptable_salt thereof are in contact with particles comprising citric_acid wherein the buprenorphine or pharmaceutically acceptable_salt thereof and the citric_acid are not in the same particle ; a pharmacologically-effective_amount of naloxone or a pharmaceutically-acceptable_salt thereof ; and a disintegrant selected from the group consisting of croscarmellose sodium sodium starch glycolate crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone and mixtures thereof
6
the composition as claimed in claim 1 wherein the particles of citric_acid are presented and act as carrier_particles
the district_court found that all the ingredients in the claims were generally known and held that although the specific_formulation was not shown or suggested in any reference the new combination would have been obvious to a person of ordinary_skill
however the prior_art does not show or suggest the claimed combination and does not show or suggest that this combination would achieve enhanced therapeutic effect while being less subject to abuse

b
the prior art
1
suboxonethe_r and subutexthe_r the buprenorphine and naloxone_combination in the 4:1 ratio has been used for substitution_therapy at least since 2002
the prior_art suboxone sublingual_tablets are a homogeneous combination made by mixing the ingredients of buprenorphine naloxone citric_acid sodium_citrate and sublingual excipients
dist
ct. op.at 769 n.17 citing physicians desk reference 58th ed
2004
subutexthe_r is the same_formulation as suboxone but without the naloxone
wo2008/152347` cairns' cited by the examiner during prosecution describes the tablet_formulation as a wet granulation process where buprenorphine citric_acid and sodium_citrate are dissolved together and then mixed with excipients
see orexo_br.at 14 & n.2` cairns provides the manufacturing process for subutexthe_r tablets a product with essentially the same_formulation as suboxonethe_r tablets but without naloxone
``

*1269 orexo attributes the improvements achieved by the zubsolv product to the microparticles of buprenorphine adhered to the surface of citric_acid_carrier_particles
orexo states that the 66 % higher bioavailability is not suggested or reasonably predictable from the prior_art
we have been directed to no reference to show or suggest otherwise
orexo stresses the examiners statement in allowing the330_patent that the improvement is due to the ingredients and the structure [ t ] he mere presence of citric_acid in the sublingual_tablets formulated according to the prior_art e.g
cairns is insufficient to achieve the superior pharmacokinetic profile exhibited by the instant invention
applicant has persuasively demonstrated that the instant tablet exhibits unexpectedly superior sublingual buprenorphine_bioavailability due to the ingredients as well as the structural characteristics recited in the instant claims
notice of allowability at 5 emphasis original application no._1 4/127,470 issued as the330_patent nov._4,_2014 ; see also orexo_br.at 29 quoting notice of allowability at 5

2
suboxonethe_r film
u.s._patent_no._8475,832` the832_patent` describes an orally dissolvable film that can not be easily removed once placed inside the mouth
the film contains the buprenorphine/naloxone_combination in the 4:1 ratio and is described as bioequivalent to suboxone sublingual_tablets
the832_patent teaches that optimum bioavailability of buprenorphine and naloxone from the film is achieved at ph 3-3.5 with citric_acid included in the film to lower the ph
the district_court relied on this presence of citric_acid to render obvious the citric_acid_carrier_particles in the zubsolv_formulation

however the832_patent does not reduce the amount of buprenorphine needed to provide an effective substitution_therapy dose
and the use of film in substitution_therapy presents recognized problems as stated in the330_patent for the film does not dissolve quickly and a maximum of only two films may be administered simultaneously producing inadequate dosage as well as problems of compliance and administration
'330_patent col._2,_ll._43-50

the orexo application
orexos u.s. patent application no._2010 /0129443` the443 application' titled` non-abusable pharmaceutical composition comprising opioids' was filed on december 3 2007 published on may_27,_2010 and issued as u.s._patent_no._8470,361 on june_25,_2013
it is prior_art as of its filing date

the443 application describes sublingual_tablets where smaller_particles of opioid_agonists are carried on larger particles that include an opioid antagonist
the443 application lists many opioid_agonists including buprenorphine and many antagonists including naloxone
however citric_acid is not mentioned or suggested as the carrier_particle

european_patent_application no
ep 0324725
european_patent_application no
ep 0324725` the ep725 application' lists a large number of watersoluble carrier_particles to which smaller_particles of a pharmaceutically active_substance may be adhered
the ep725 application does not mention sublingual_tablets does not mention opioids as the active_substance and does not mention citric_acid as a carrier

c. the district court decision
the district_court held the asserted330_patent claims invalid ruling that a skilled *1270 artisan would obviously have selected these components from the prior_art and reformulated them as in the330_patent
the district_court stated that the443 application taught that` a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have been motivated to reformulate suboxone_tablets as an interactive_mixture to improve bioavailability' dist
ct. op.at 773 ; that the832_patent for an oral_film` expressly taught a person of ordinary_skill that the addition of citric_acid facilitated an increased level of absorption of buprenorphine despite a lower ph' id.at 772-73 ; and that the ep725 application` described how to make such a mixture using dry mixing' id.at 773

in response to orexos argument that no reference showed the new formulation in the330_patent stressing the unexpectedly enhanced bioavailability and its benefits the district_court reasoned that a skilled_artisan` would not have excluded citric_acid' as a carrier and` would have known how to form an interactive_mixture using citric_acid'
id
the district_court found that the832_patent taught` the use of citric_acid with an interactive_mixture would also improve [ buprenorphine ] bioavailability' id. and concluded that it would have been obvious to use citric_acid as carrier_particles

orexo argued that a person of ordinary_skill would have been dissuaded from using citric_acid in this interactive_mixture because examples 6-8 of the832_patent taught that as the ph is lowered through use of citric_acid the buprenorphine_bioavailability increase is accompanied by a compromised naloxone availability such that the 4:1 ratio is lost
the district_court described this argument as irrelevant because the 4:1 ratio is an` unclaimed feature' of the330_patent the court stating` any problems with maintaining the ratio forecast by the832_patent goes to the reasonable_expectation of success_requirement not to motivation to combine ; i.e. this argument is irrelevant in this context'
id.at 773 n.23

orexo stresses that no reference teaches or suggests using citric_acid_particles as a carrier for micronized buprenorphine and that the benefits of this formulation were unexpected
rejecting this argument the district_court cited the testimony of actavis expert that citric_acid` fits the definition of a carrier_particle' and` therefore it would act as a carrier_particle because it is in the suboxone_tablet'
dist
ct. op.at 771 quoting testimony of dr._dyar
however no reference suggests citric_acid_carrier_particles

the district_court also discussed the objective_indicia of unobviousness responding to orexos arguments of unexpectedly increased bioavailability long-felt need for improved_treatment of opioid_dependence copying by actavis and hindsight
the court stated that` the unexpected_result of increased bioavailability provides some support for nonobviousness' dist
ct. op.at 776 but found that interactive_mixtures were generally known to improve bioavailability and that the increase here was a`difference in degree not a difference inkind
`` id.at 774
the district_court stated that orexos arguments of teaching away long-felt need and copying were` not persuasive_evidence'
id.at 773 n.27 776
the court concluded that` actavis has met its burden to prove by clear and convincing_evidence that claims 1 3-6 and 8-10 are obvious'

standard of review
following a bench_trial we review the district_courts factual_findings for clear error

2012` while we afford deference *1271 to a district_courts factual_findings however we retain plenary review to determine whether as a legal matter the evidence satisfies the clear-and-convincing standard of proof

obviousness is a question of law based on the facts of 1 the scope and content of the prior_art 2 the level of ordinary_skill in the field 3 the differences between the claimed invention and the prior_art and 4 any objective_indicia of nonobviousness
graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 17-18 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966)
to invalidate a patent on the ground of obviousness the challenger has the burden of proving that the subject_matter as a whole would have been obvious to a person of ordinary_skill in the field of the invention
35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a
a party seeking to invalidate a patent on obviousness grounds must demonstrate by clear and convincing_evidence that a person of ordinary_skill would have selected and combined and modified the subject_matter of the references in the manner of the claimed invention with a reasonable_expectation of success
e.g. intouch techs. inc. v. vgo commc'ns inc. 751_f.3d_1327 1347 fed

judicial hindsight must be avoided
see ksr int l co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 421 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007)` a factfinder should be aware of course of the distortion caused by hindsight_bias and must be cautious of arguments reliant upon ex post reasoning`
it is inappropriate to use the template provided by the inventor to render the inventors contribution obvious
see interconnect planning corp. v. feil 774_f.2d_1132 1138 fed
cir
1985` the invention must be viewed not with the blueprint drawn by the inventor but in the state of the art that existed at the time
the invention must be evaluated not through the eyes of the inventor who may have been of exceptional skill but as by one ofordinary_skill
``

obviousness
in holding the330_patents claims invalid for obviousness the district_court cited the832_patent to show that` the use of citric_acid with an interactive_mixture would also improve bioavailability'
dist
ct. op.at 773
the832_patent is for a film that includes citric_acid to lower the ph of the film
example 7 of the832_patent shows that a lowering of ph to 5.5 increases buprenorphine_bioavailability but also compromises the desired 4:1 ratio of buprenorphine to naloxone
'832_patent col._21,_ll._17-26
example 8 of the832_patent shows that a further decrease in ph to 3.5 using citric_acid maintained the 4:1 ratio but did not increase buprenorphine_bioavailability
id. col._23,_ll._1-11
the832_patent is directed to replacing sublingual_tablets with oral_film for possible advantage in administration
there is no suggestion of the different structure of the zubsolv tablet and its advantage in deterring abuse
the zubsolv structure is achieved solely upon the hindsight knowledge of the structure and benefits described in the330_patent

the district_court cited the orexo443 application for its disclosure of particles of buprenorphine adhered to carrier_particles
however the443 application does not mention citric_acid in its extensive_list of carriers and does not suggest that citric_acid_carrier_particles may provide benefits compared with the prior_art
these benefits were not predicted or suggested in any reference

the district_court cited the ep725 application for its general description of interactive_mixtures as pharmaceutical formulations
this reference does not mention opioids does not mention sublingual_tablets does not mention citric_acid in its *1272 extensive_list of carrier_particles and does not suggest the formulation in the330_patent or its unexpected benefits

the product herein is admittedly new
the district_court acknowledged the undisputed testimony of orexos co-founder mr. thomas lundqvist and orexos global chief medical officer dr. michael sumner
the district_court wrote lundqvist testified that the first clinical results showed that zubsolv had a 66 %_improvement in bioavailability
( d.i
202_at_589-15 ; d.i
211_at_36 according to a bioequivalence study zubsolv increases the bioavailability of buprenorphine such that patients require a 29 % lower dose using zubsolv as compared to suboxone

202_at_6311-17 [ testimony of mr. lundqvist ] ; d.i
205_at_77022-771:3 [ testimony of dr. sumner ] ; d.i
196_at_12 orexos pharmaceutical development report stated that` [ d ] ue to the anticipated improved dissolution of buprenorphine the selected dose of 6 mg_buprenorphine is expected to give approximately the same systemic buprenorphine exposure in humans as a suboxonethe_r tablet with 8 mg_buprenorphine'

203_at_35211-22 dist
ct. op.at 760 citations in original bracketed information added

the district_court nonetheless concluded that the zubsolv_formulation was obvious
the court cited actaviss expert dr._dyar as showing that` citric_acid is pharmaceutically acceptable water soluble and of the right_size so therefore it would act as a carrier_particle because it is in the suboxone_tablet'
dist
ct. op.at 771 quoting j.a
6685 june_8,_2016 trial tr.at 433:12-15 ecf no._204 testimony of dr._dyar
orexo points out that dr._dyar cited no reference and describes this reasoning as` hindsight_bias' for it recreates the prior_art from the teaching in the330_patent
orexo points out that citric_acid is nowhere used or listed or suggested as a carrier_particle and it is not so used in the suboxone_tablet

at the oral argument of this appeal actavis conceded that no reference teaches using citric_acid as a carrier_particle or that citric_acid should be used as a carrier_particle actavis_counsel your honor i will confirm what counsel said before and what weve said in our briefs
there is no piece of prior_art that was presented that says citric_acid is a carrier_particle or should be used as a carrier_particle
oral
arg.at 21:19-21:36 http //oralarguments.cafc.uscourts.gov/default.aspx ? fl=2017-1333.mp3
court if both of those things are really well known then one would think that if citric_acid were routinely or it was obvious to use it as a carrier_particle you could have found some reference that used it
...
your expert did n't even testify that he was familiar with this industry and that citric_acid was routinely used as a carrier_particle in interactive_mixtures
he just said it was the right_size and it could be used
actavis_counsel well
youre right your honor in terms of your characterization of the record
there was not citric_acid used as a carrier_particle that was in the record
id.at 26:12-26:50

dr._dyar did not testify that a skilled_artisan would obviously select citric_acid as a carrier for buprenorphine ; he stated that if it were selected the artisan would expect it to work
the district_courts finding that` a person of ordinary_skill in the art would not have excluded citric_acid' dist
ct. op.at 773 is not a teaching or suggestion to use citric_acid
see in re gordon 733_f.2d_900 902 fed
cir
1984` the mere fact that the prior_art could be so modified would not have made the modification *1273 obvious unless the prior_art suggested the desirability of the modification`
the record does not contain clear and convincing_evidence of a teaching or suggestion to use citric_acid_particles as a carrier for this opioid product in substitution_therapy or that the actual beneficial results would be obtained

orexo also argued that the specific_formulation in the330_patent preserves the 4:1 ratio of buprenorphine to naloxone during use of the product unlike the prior_art products
the district_court stated that this benefit is irrelevant because it` goes to the reasonable_expectation of success_requirement not to motivation to combine'
dist
ct. op.at 773 n.23
the district_court found that` there is nothing in the prior_art which would have discouraged a person of ordinary_skill from following the path set out in the various_references'
id.at 773
however no reference or combination of references proposes the path of the330_patent

the question is not whether the various_references separately taught components of the330_patent formulation but whether the prior_art suggested the selection and combination achieved by the330 inventors
although the reference832_patent showed that buprenorphine_bioavailability in the film formulation is affected by ph this is not a suggestion of the sublingual_tablet interactive formulation in the330_patent or a teaching of its benefit in deterring abuse

the references show that the field of opioid biopharmacology has received extensive scientific study
the330_patent provides a significant improvement
despite the extensive study this improvement over the then-available treatments for addiction is not proposed or suggested in the references
there is no suggestion that the specified elements should be selected and combined and that the designated sublingual formulation would be less subject to abuse than prior formulations for substitution_therapy
although the need to reduce this abuse was known recognizing a need does not render the solution obvious

here the objective_indicia guide the analysis of obviousness
see e.g. leo pharm prods. ltd. v. rea 726_f.3d_1346 1357-58 fed
cir
2013` [ t ] his court has emphasized that consideration of the objective_indicia is part of the whole obviousness analysis not just an after-thought`
the district_court stated` the unexpected_result of increased bioavailability provides some support for nonobviousness' although the court also stated that orexos long-felt need and copying arguments` are not persuasive_evidence of such'
dist
ct. op.at 776
the court reasoned that the prior_art sought to improve bioavailability that interactive_mixtures were known to improve bioavailability and therefore that the improved result of the330_patents formulation was inadequate to serve as probative evidence of unexpected_results
see id.at 774

orexo states that the district_court erred for the prior_art does not teach or suggest the330_patents formulation as a way to improve bioavailability
actavis responds that the prior_art is silent` about whether it would be expected or difficultto increase buprenorphine absorption without simultaneously increasing naloxone absorption to unacceptable levels
`` actavis_br.at 62
orexo counters that silence is not a teaching or suggestion ; and that the beneficial results could not be predicted and were indeed unexpected.4

*1274 the district_court erred in discounting the enhanced bioavailability in the330_patents formulation as` adifference in degree not a difference inkind` dist
ct. op.at 774 for the clinical studies reported in the330_patent show 66 % improved bioavailability
particularly in the context of this invention this is more than a trivial` degree'

the district_court also discounted orexos evidence that zubsolv is less susceptible to abuse than suboxone stating that` orexosreal world evidence set forth above is not compelling or unrebutted' and that` [ t ] he only objective evidence for this factor is that which was presented to and rejected by the fda'
id.at 776
orexo stated that evidence of zubsolvs effectiveness in reducing abuse accumulated after fda approval and was presented to the district_court
although the weight of this evidence was disputed the fda deemed the product worthy of approval for the efficacy that was established in the clinical_trials
it was established that this novel formulation enables reduced dosage and enhanced efficacy in substitution_therapy products deterring abuse

on the entirety of the record actavis did not establish obviousness by clear and convincing_evidence
the judgment of invalidity is reversed
we remand for appropriate further proceedings

an agonist is a chemical compound that binds to a receptor and activates the receptor to produce a biological response
partial opioid_agonists have opioid agonist effects that` are less than the maximal effects of otherfull opioid_agonists such as morphine and are limited by aceiling effect
the drug thus produces a lower degree of physical dependence than other opioid_agonists such as heroin morphine or methadone and is therefore particularly useful in substitution_therapy'
