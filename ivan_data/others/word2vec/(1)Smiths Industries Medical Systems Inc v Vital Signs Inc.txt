smiths_industries_medical_systems inc.` smiths' appeals from the judgment of the united_states_district_court for the northern_district of illinois that all the claims of smithss patent for a manual_resuscitator are invalid and that certain_claims are not infringed by two accused products manufactured by appellee vital_signs inc.` vital_signs'
see smith_indus
med sys. inc. v. vital_signs inc. 4_f.supp.2d_746 748-52 n.d.ill.1997
for the reasons set forth below we conclude that the district_court misinterpreted the claims of smithss patent
we therefore reverse the district_courts judgment of invalidity under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 and vacate its judgment of noninfringement
the case is remanded to the district_court for further_proceedings

i
this appeal involves united states patent no._4774,941 issued on october 4 *1350 1988 to wallace f. cook the`941_patent` or the` cook_patent'
the941_patent is assigned to intertech resources inc. which has been succeeded by plaintiff-appellant smiths and is directed to a manual_resuscitator_device
both smiths and vital_signs manufacture and sell disposable manual_resuscitator_devices which are used by medical personnel in emergency or trauma situations to supply air or oxygen to patients who have difficulty breathing on their own or who have stopped breathing

manual resuscitators are typically composed of three main elements a face-mask that seals around the patients nose and mouth a directional_valve_assembly that directs gas to and from the patient and a squeezable bag` squeezebag' that supplies pressure for forcing gas to the patient
some resuscitators employ a squeezebag with a single opening which are known in the art as` single-entry_bags'
in a single-entry bag resuscitator gas to be delivered to the patient first enters the squeezebag from a supply source and collects in the squeezebag ; when the squeezebag is compressed the collected gas exits the squeezebag through the same opening and is directed to the patient by the valve_assembly
in contrast` double-entry_bags' have two openings at opposite_ends ; gas enters through one opening and is stored in the squeezebag and is then delivered to the patient through the other opening
a further variation of the manual_resuscitator known in the art as a` mouth-to-mask' resuscitator omits the squeezebag altogether
the mouth-to-mask_resuscitator has a hollow_tube in place of a squeezebag ; a rescue worker supplies the pressure needed to force air into a patients lungs by blowing through the hollow_tube

the key feature in manual_resuscitators is the directional_valve_assembly
the valve_assembly allows a resuscitator to operate in three different modes
first during forced inhalation a worker compresses the squeezebag and the valve_assembly allows gas to be forced into the patients lungs
second during exhalation the patient breathes out and the valve_assembly directs the exhaled gases away from the patient and to the exterior of the resuscitation_system
third during spontaneous_breathing the valve_assembly allows a patient who is breathing on her own to draw air and/or oxygen though the squeezebag and to exhale into the outside environment
thus during inhalation the valve_assembly simultaneously opens a passageway from the squeezebag to the patient and closes off the air passage between the patient and the external_environment ; conversely during exhalation the valve_assembly simultaneously closes off the passageway from the patient to the squeezebag and opens the air path from the patient to the external_environment so that exhaled gases are discharged to the exterior of the resuscitation_system

figures 2_and_3 of the cook_patent reproduced here depict the operation of the941 inventions valve_assembly and the flow of air through the resuscitator during two of the three operating modes described above
figure 2 shows the state of the valve_assembly during forced inhalation
in this mode a` duck-billed' diaphragm 30 seals against the end 36a of a tube 36 to close off the exit_port 38
the arrows show that the gas inside the squeezebag 12 passes through the duck-billed valve 30a to the patient
figure 3 in contrast shows the operation of the valve during patient exhalation
the duck-billed diaphragm 30 disengages from the end of the tube 36 the duck-billed valve 30a closes and exhaled gases pass from the patient through the exit_port 38 to the external_environment

vital_signs the defendant sells three lines of products that are accused of infringing the941_patent a double-entry_squeezebag_resuscitator the` vital blue' a single-entry_squeezebag_resuscitator the` code_blue' and a mouth-to-mask_resuscitator the` mm 7100'
smiths brought suit in district_court alleging that all three products infringe the941_patent

claim 4 is one of two independent claims in the941_patent and reads in relevant part 4
a resuscitator comprising a means for supplying gas having a hollow_interior and first and second_openings at opposite_ends thereof ; b a directional control valve_assembly fastened to said gas_supplying means at said first_opening ;.. d said assembly further comprising a tubular patient port joined to said first end of said valve_housing and adapted to be coupled in gas_flow_communication to a patient.. ; *1352 e.. an annular_exit_passage being formed between said valve_housing and said extension and an interior_flow_passage being formed within said extension said interior_flow_passage being in flow_communication with said first_opening ; f an unobstructed_exit_port formed in said valve_housing in flow_communication with said annular_exit_passage ;.. h said unobstructed_port and said annular_exit_passage forming a valveless_exit_flow_path during exhalation and forming a valveless_intake_flow_path during spontaneous_inhalation when said second_opening is occluded

in the course of proceedings before the district_court vital_signs moved for partial summary judgment of noninfringement with respect to its code_blue and mm 7100 resuscitators arguing that claim_limitation 4 a did not read on these devices
the court interpreted the` means for supplying gas having.. first and second_openings at opposite_ends thereof' as recited in claim_limitation 4 a to refer to a means for supplying gas under pressure
see intertech_resources_inc. v. vital_signs inc. 1997_wl_359966 at *3 n.d.ill.1997
based on this interpretation the court found that claim_limitation 4 a was literally met by neither the code_blue nor the mm 7100 see id. but it reserved for trial the question of whether these devices infringed under the doctrine of equivalents
after a full bench trial the court held that the accused code_blue_device does not infringe the941_patent under the doctrine of equivalents.1 see smith_indus. 4 f.supp.2d at 749
applying the function-way-result test the court found that the location of the gas_source and the squeezebag` makes a material difference in the operation of the device' citing as evidence the amount of time it would take to fill each bag with oxygen the difference in oxygen concentration provided to the patient the difference in cost of the bags the potential difference in the size of the gas entry openings between single- and double-entry_squeezebags and the difference in complexity between valve_assemblies for single- and double-entry_squeezebag_resuscitators
see id

with respect to the accused vital_blue_resuscitator the court stated that` [ t ] here is not much dispute that the vital blue lines infringe the cook_patent if the cook patent is valid' 2 but held that claims 1-6 are invalid as obvious under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103
smith_indus. 4 f.supp.2d at 749-50 752
in its validity_analysis the district_court relied heavily on a previously issued patent u.s. patent no._3556,122 to laerdal the` laerdal122_patent` as well as on three resuscitators manufactured by laerdal and known as the resusci folding bags` rfb' i ii and iii respectively
the court first found that rfb_ii and rfb_iii contained all of the limitations in the941 invention except for the identical claim_limitations recited in claims 1 paragraph i and claim 4 paragraph h
because rfb_ii and rfb_iii included a one-way valve-referred to by the parties as a` flapper_valve' -which *1353 ensured that outside_air could not leak back into the resuscitator through the exit_port the court held that such devices did not have` an unobstructed_exit_port' and did not anticipate the claims of the941_patent
nevertheless the district_court found the addition of the unobstructed_exit_port to be obvious under section 103 noting that one could achieve the same_result as the941_patent simply by removing the flapper_valve from the two rfb_devices
see id.at 752

smiths appeals both the district_courts ruling that the accused code_blue and mm 7100 resuscitators are not within the language of claim_limitation 4 a of the941_patent and that claims 1-6 are invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103

ii
we first consider smithss argument that the district_court erred in holding all the claims of the941_patent invalid
under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a claimed invention is unpatentable if` the differences between the subject_matter sought to be patented and the prior_art are such that the subject_matter as a whole would have been obvious' to one of ordinary_skill in the art at the time the invention was made
35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a supp
ii 1996

smiths argues that the district_court erred in three ways in holding the claims obvious
first smiths asserts that the district_court misperceived or ignored differences between its claimed invention and the prior_art
second smiths alleges that the district_court improperly combined the prior_art without any teaching or motivation to do so
finally smiths argues that the district_court did not give proper credit to the widespread commercial success of smithss products as objective evidence of nonobviousness

a
it is well-established that the first step in any validity_analysis is to construe the claims of the invention to determine the subject_matter for which patent protection is sought
see rockwell int l corp. v. united states 147_f.3d_1358 1362 47_uspq2d_1027 1029 fed.cir.1998 ; elmer v. icc fabricating 67_f.3d_1571 1574 36_uspq2d_1417 1420 fed.cir.1995 ; beachcombers int l v. wildewood creative prods. 31_f.3d_1154 1163 31_uspq2d_1653 1660 fed.cir.1994
claim interpretation for the purpose of analyzing patentability like claim_construction for considering infringement is a legal_matter over which we exercise de novo_review
see cybor corp. v. fas techs. inc. 138_f.3d_1448 1456 46_uspq2d_1169 1174 fed.cir.1998 en banc ; markman v. westview instruments inc. 52_f.3d_967 981 34_uspq2d_1321 1331 fed.cir.1995 en banc affd 517_u.s._370 116_s.ct._1384 134_l.ed.2d_577 38_uspq2d_1461_(1996)

the claims properly interpreted define the scope of the invention and allow the trial_court to determine whether the claimed invention would have been obvious in light of the prior_art
here however the trial_court failed to give a complete interpretation of the claims of the941_patent
we note that by resolving the meaning to be given to disputed claim terms and by engaging the parties in such a process trial_courts are often able to narrow disputes and provide more efficient trials
despite the lack of a full claim_construction the district_courts opinion does provide some insight into its understanding of the invention
in particular it seems clear that the trial_court understood the claimed invention to be a resuscitator with an unobstructed_exit_port and which allows a patient to breathe outside_air through the exit_port if the gas_supply to the squeezebag is blocked
see smith_indus. 4 f.supp.2d at 752
indeed the court found that claim_limitations 1 i and 4 h which recite the unobstructed_exit_port and its ability to act as an alternate *1354 intake air path did not read on the prior_art rfb_devices and thus precluded a finding of anticipation under section 102
the court did not dwell long on this limitation however finding that it would have been obvious to remove the flapper_valve from laerdal to achieve the limitation recited in claim_limitation 4 h
see id

smiths contends that the trial_court committed error because it failed to understand the nature of the941 invention and because it overlooked a specific claimed feature of its invention
specifically smiths asserts that in the spontaneous_breathing mode the claimed invention must allow a patient to both breathe air and oxygen through the squeezebag when the gas_supply is not obstructed and to be able to breathe outside_air in the event that the gas_supply to the squeezebag becomes blocked
according to smiths this aspect of its invention is unique because the prior_art including the laerdal122_patent and the rfb_devices on which the district_court relied to find the941 invention obvious require a patient either to breathe gas through the squeezebag or to breathe outside_air through the exit_port but do not automatically alternate between these two options based on the state of occlusion of the gas_source
thus smiths argues when configured with a flapper_valve in place the rfb_devices allow a patient to breathe through the squeezebag but not through the exit_port ; conversely when configured without a flapper_valve the rfb_devices may allow a patient to breathe some air through the exit_port but do not allow the patient to breathe exclusively through the squeezebag even when there is no obstruction in the gas_supply

we agree with smithss interpretation of the claims
the941_patent does indeed claim a resuscitator which allows a patient to spontaneously inhale gas through the squeezebag during normal nonoccluded gas_supply operation and to breathe outside_air through an unobstructed_exit_port should the gas_source to the squeezebag become occluded
for example claim_limitations 4 d and 4 e recite that normally the patient is in` gas_flow_communication' with the interior_flow_passage of a tubular extension which in turn is in flow_communication with the squeezebag
it follows that during normal inhalation whether forced or spontaneous the patient breathes in the gas that has collected in the squeezebag
claim limitation 4 h recites a further limitation namely an` unobstructed [ exit ] port and [ an ] annular_exit_passage forming a valveless_exit_flow_path during exhalation and forming a valveless_intake_flow_path during spontaneous_inhalation when said second_opening is occluded'
'941_patent col. 6 lines 51-55 emphasis added
claim 4 thus clearly includes a second alternative intake air path via an unobstructed_port which exists only when the patient is breathing spontaneously and the second_opening of the squeezebag through which gas is supplied to the squeezebag becomes blocked
the941_patent therefore claims a resuscitator that normally allows a patient to spontaneously breathe gas that is stored in the squeezebag but which automatically directs the patient to breathe ambient_air through an unobstructed_exit_port if the gas_supply to the squeezebag becomes occluded

b
the second step in an obviousness inquiry is to determine whether the claimed invention would have been obvious as a legal_matter based on underlying factual inquiries including 1 the scope and content of the prior_art 2 the level of ordinary_skill in the art 3 the differences between the claimed invention and the prior_art and 4 secondary considerations of nonobviousness
see graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 17-18 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545 148_uspq_459 467 1966
*1355 we apply de novo_review to the trial_courts ultimate legal determination of obviousness whereas we review the underlying factual determinations for clear error
see miles lab. inc. v. shandon inc. 997_f.2d_870 877 27_uspq2d_1123 1128 fed.cir.1993

the district_courts erroneous_claim_construction also led it to err in its analysis of the differences between the claimed invention and the prior_art
the district_courts claim_construction was incorrect because as already discussed claims 1-6 of the941 invention are limited to a device that must both allow a patient to breathe through the squeezebag normally and to breathe outside_air should a blockage occur in the gas_supply and to automatically switch between these two modes depending on the state of occlusion of the gas_source
the district_court understood that the ability to breathe through the exit_port is an explicit limitation of the invention but proceeded to find that this limitation could easily be met by removing the flapper_valve from the rfb_devices
see smith_indus. 4 f.supp.2d at 752
even if the courts fact-finding on this point is correct it is not sufficient to support a conclusion of obviousness
smiths concedes that a patient using the rfb device without a flapper_valve would be able to breathe outside_air through an unobstructed_exit_port
however smiths argues-based on evidence in the record-that a patient using an rfb_ii or rfb_iii device configured without a flapper_valve would always breathe outside_air through the exit_port presumably because outside_air` leaks' into the resuscitator system unless a flapper_valve is used
removing the flapper_valve from the laerdal122 invention might indeed allow that device to achieve the same_result as the941 invention when the gas_source is blocked but it might also jeopardize the functioning of the laerdal resuscitator during normal non-occluded operation

we conclude that the district_court misapprehended the nature of the941 inventions emergency_breathing_feature and how it complements` normal' operation during spontaneous patient breathing
we therefore can not agree with its conclusion that the only distinguishing feature of the941_patent is an unobstructed_exit_port nor that removal of the flapper_valve would have been obvious to one of ordinary_skill in the art at the time of the invention
accordingly the district_courts finding that claims 1-6 of the941_patent are invalid can not stand

we note that both the owner in interest smiths and the inventor cook during litigation before the district_court and throughout the prosecution of the941_patent respectively have consistently emphasized the emergency_breathing_feature as a critical feature that distinguished the claimed invention over the prior_art
for example the prosecution history is replete with references to the emergency_breathing_feature in response to the examiners repeated rejections over the laerdal122_patent reference
similarly when counsel for smiths was asked by the trial judge at the opening of the bench trial to specifically identify the novelty in the941 invention counsel not only described the combination of elements such as a domed housing an unobstructed_exit_port and a duck-bill diaphragm but also stated that the941 invention` handled particularly well with the situation of spontaneous_breathing either when the bag is occluded or when it is not occluded'
trial transcript at 44 smith_indus. 4_f.supp.2d_746
despite smithss clear position on this issue however vital_signs failed to prove at trial by clear and convincing_evidence that the prior_art devices possess the emergency breathing limitation claimed in the941_patent or that the prior_art renders this claim_limitation obvious
accordingly we reverse the trial_courts judgment that claims 1-6 of *1356 the941_patent are invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103

c. our decision to reverse the trial_courts decision on invalidity is also necessitated by the courts improper combination of various references in its obviousness analysis
smiths conceded at trial that each limitation in the claims is probably found in the prior_art
see smith 4 f.supp.2d at 750
however there is no basis for concluding that an invention would have been obvious solely because it is a combination of elements that were known in the art at the time of the invention
see fromson v. advance offset plate inc. 755_f.2d_1549 1556 225_uspq_26 31 fed.cir.1985
instead the relevant inquiry is whether there is a reason suggestion or motivation in the prior_art that would lead one of ordinary_skill in the art to combine the references and that would also suggest a reasonable likelihood of success
see e.g. in re dow chem co. 837_f.2d_469 473 5_uspq2d_1529 1531-32 fed.cir.1988
such a suggestion or motivation may come from the references themselves from knowledge by those skilled in the art that certain references are of special interest in a field or even from the nature of the problem to be solved
see in re rouffet 149_f.3d_1350 1355-56 47_uspq2d_1453 1456 fed.cir.1998 ; pro-mold & tool co. v. great lakes plastics inc. 75_f.3d_1568 1573 37_uspq2d_1626 1630 fed.cir.1996

here the district_court summarily concluded that it would have been obvious to combine the various_claim_limitations found in the941 invention from the prior_art
see smith 4 f.supp.2d at 753
however the court never identified the source of the various_claim_limitations in the prior_art much less a motivation teaching or suggestion to combine them
indeed the district_court appears to have rested its decision in large measure on its conclusion that smiths was unable` before the pto.. to define clearly the distinctiveness of the941_patent from the prior_art'
id.at 752
that of course was an incorrect basis for decision because the claims were allowed and the patent issued
the issued patent carries a presumption of validity
see 35 u.s.c.¡± 282 1994
this presumption is manifested by the requirement that one who seeks to invalidate a patent do so by clear and convincing_evidence see e.g. medtronic inc. v. intermedics inc. 799_f.2d_734 741 230_uspq_641 645 fed.cir.1986 in view of the patent examiners conclusion that the invention was patentable
see e.g. hewlett-packard co. v. bausch & lomb inc. 909_f.2d_1464 1467 15_uspq2d_1525 1527 fed.cir.1990 ; intervet america v. kee-vet lab. 887_f.2d_1050 1054 12_uspq2d_1474 1477 fed.cir.1989 ; american hoist & derrick co. v. sowa & sons inc. 725_f.2d_1350 1359 220_uspq_763 770 fed.cir.1984

vital_signs has not offered sufficient independent evidence to support the district_courts decision to combine elements from different references arguing only that the suggestion to combine references may come from the knowledge and common sense of a person of ordinary_skill in the art
see e.g. in re bozek 57_c.c.p.a._713 416_f.2d_1385 1390 163_uspq_545 549 ccpa 1969
that knowledge may have been within the province of the ordinary artisan does not in and of itself make it so absent clear and convincing_evidence of such knowledge
see c.r
bard inc. v. m3 sys. inc. 157_f.3d_1340 1352 48_uspq2d_1225 1232 fed.cir.1998 ; ashland oil inc. v. delta resins & refractories inc. 776_f.2d_281 297-98 227_uspq_657 667 fed.cir.1985
vital_signs thus failed in this case to establish why one of ordinary_skill would have found it obvious to combine the numerous claim_limitations in a particular way to achieve *1357 the941 invention
therefore the district_courts judgment of invalidity must be reversed on this ground as well

iii
we turn next to smithss contention that the district_court erred in finding that the accused code_blue and mm 7100 devices do not come within the language of claim_limitation 4 a of the cook_patent
smiths argues that the district_court erred as a matter of law by limiting claim_limitation 4 a to a means for supplying gas under pressure rather than simply a means for supplying gas and that the code_blue and mm 7100 literally meet the properly construed claim_limitation 4 a
alternatively smiths takes issue with the trial_courts factual findings under the doctrine of equivalents and argues that vital_signss own statements demonstrate that the code_blue is equivalent to the vital_blue_resuscitator which admittedly infringes the941_patent

to determine whether an accused product infringes a patent a court must first construe the asserted claims of the patent to determine their proper scope and then the trier of fact must determine whether all of the claim_limitations are present either literally or by a substantial equivalent
see renishaw plc v. marposs societa per azioni 158_f.3d_1243 1248 48_uspq2d_1117 1120 fed.cir.1998
for a claim drafted as a means-plus-function_limitation under 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
6 a court must first look to the patent_specification to determine the` corresponding structure' that performs the claimed function ; the claim is then construed to cover that corresponding structure as well as` equivalents thereof'
35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
6 1994 ; see valmont indus. inc. v. reinke mfg co. inc. 983_f.2d_1039 1042-43 25_uspq2d_1451 1454-55 fed.cir.1993

a
in its literal infringement analysis the district_court first held that claim_limitation 4 a is a means-plus-function_limitation under section 112 ?
6
see 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
6 1994
neither party has objected to this holding and we therefore proceed accordingly
the court erred in the next step of the claim_construction process by interpreting the claim_language` means for supplying gas' to require a means for supplying gas under pressure
it is improper to import the limitation` under pressure' from the written description into the claim because the claim_language is clear on its face
see renishaw 158 f.3d at 1248-49 48 uspq2d at 1121 holding that there must be a claim term in need of clarification in order to draw in statements from the written description
instead the function recited by the means-plus-function_claim_limitation is simply the function of` supplying gas' and it is this function alone that serves as the touchstone for identifying the disclosed corresponding structure that is recited by the means-plus-function_claim_limitation

section 112 ?
6 next directs the court to identify structure described in the patent_specification that corresponds to the claimed function
see_pennwalt_corp. v. durand-wayland inc. 833_f.2d_931 934 4_uspq2d_1737 1738-39 fed.cir.1987 en banc
in this step the trial_court correctly identified a squeezebag as the structure corresponding to the gas-supplying function because it is the structure disclosed in the specification that performs such a function
for example the written description plainly states that` [ t ] he bag is the means for supplying air under pressure to the patient'
'941_patent col. 1 lines 39-40
more specifically the specification does not describe a generic squeezebag but rather only a double-entry_squeezebag as demonstrated by the figures in the941_patent the detailed description of the invention and the language in claim_limitation 4 a itself
thus the` corresponding structure' in means-plus-function_claim_limitation 4 a is limited *1358 to the double-entry_squeezebag as shown and described in the specification of the941_patent

finally section 112 ?
6 provides that the literal scope of a means-plus-function_claim includes the identified corresponding structure-in this case the double-entry_squeezebag-as well as` equivalents thereof'
35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
6 1994 ; see pennwalt corp. 833 f.2d at 934 4 uspq2d at 1738-39
for an accused structure to be an equivalent under section 112 ?
6 however it must both have an equivalent_structure and also perform the identical_function as that recited in the claim_language
see_pennwalt_corp. 833 f.2d at 934 4 uspq2d at 1738-39
at the summary judgment stage the trial_court determined that the accused code_blue and mm 7100 devices do not literally meet claim_limitation 4 a of the941_patent because they do not have equivalent_structure that performs the identical_function
in particular the court held that there is no structure in the accused devices that both supplies gas under pressure and meets the further structural limitation recited by claim 4 paragraph a namely that the structure also have` a hollow_interior and first and second_openings at opposite_ends thereof'
as set forth above however the district_courts claim_construction was flawed the claimed function in the means-plus-function_claim is` supplying gas' not supplying gas under pressure
thus the district_courts section 112 ?
6 equivalents analysis was flawed because it used the incorrect function in its` identical_function equivalent_structure' analysis
accordingly we vacate the courts finding of no literal infringement by the accused code_blue and mm 7100 resuscitators

the determination of the contours of the corresponding structure in a means-plus-function_claim as contrasted with the question of whether an accused structure is equivalent to such a corresponding structure is a matter of law for courts to decide because it is a question of claim_construction
see chiuminatta_concrete_concepts inc. v. cardinal_indus. inc. 145_f.3d_1303 1308 46_uspq2d_1752 1755-56 fed.cir.1998 ; b. braun med. inc. v. abbott lab. 124_f.3d_1419 1424-25 43_uspq2d_1896 1899-1900 fed.cir.1997
in this case the squeezebag described in the941 specification does not operate solely by supplying gas under pressure
in one of the operating modes-forced inhalation-the squeezebag is compressed and does indeed supply pressure to force air into the patients lungs
in other modes however the squeezebag does not provide any pressure
for example the written description states that during spontaneous_breathing the squeezebag supplies gas by merely allowing air to` flow through the bag 12 to the patient'
'941_patent col. 4 lines 24-25
furthermore the squeezebag also acts as a reservoir to collect oxygen
see941_patent col. 4 lines 43-48
thus the941 specification suggests at least three different_characteristics that inform how the disclosed squeezebag is a` means for supplying gas' first as a flexible_bag that can be squeezed to provide pressure for forcing air to the patient ; second as a hollow_structure through which gas passes on its way to the patient ; and third as a reservoir for collecting oxygen or other_gas that will be delivered to the patient

in this court both parties have presented arguments regarding why there is or is not equivalent_structure in the accused devices which performs the` supplying gas' function
the district_court did not address the merits of these arguments because of its erroneous_claim_construction and we express no opinion on them here
instead we charge the district_court with determining in the first_instance whether there is structure in the accused devices that is equivalent to the941_patents double-entry_squeezebag as described above *1359 and that performs the identical_function of supplying gas
similarly we will not greet and decide the parties various arguments as to why the code_blue and mm 7100 devices may or may not infringe under the doctrine of equivalents
that issue should again be decided in the first_instance by the trial_court employing the correct claim interpretation and understanding of the structure described in the specification that corresponds to the means limitation

iv
because the district_court erred in its interpretation of claim_language in the941_patent the judgment that claims 1-6 of the941_patent are invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 is vacated and the judgment that the accused code_blue and mm 7100 resuscitators do not meet claim_limitation 4 a of the941_patent is vacated
the case is remanded to the district_court for further_proceedings

costs
no costs

reversed-in-part vacated-in-part and remanded

lourie circuit_judge dissenting in part
while i join the majoritys opinion on the question of invalidity i disagree that the question of infringement must await a remand and would instead affirm the judgment of noninfringement
i do agree that the district_court erred in construing the expression` means for supplying gas' to require supplying gas` under pressure'
however in view of the readily understandable nature of the subject_matter involved we can ascertain that this error was harmless

smiths argument concerning infringement of its patent by the code_blue and 7100mm devices is untenable
smiths theory as to how the` means for supplying gas having.. first and second_openings at opposite_ends' limitation is met in the accused products is made clear with the help of the following diagrams from smiths brief which highlight those portions of the accused devices that allegedly correspond to this limitation

*1360. ?
smiths contends that the` connectors' in solid black in the accused devices between the valve_assemblies and the air inlet passages meet the disputed limitation
smiths does not contend that any connector disclosed in the941_patent is the structure that corresponds to the claimed function in the disputed limitation under ¡± 112 ?
6
if it did so it would logically argue that the connectors in the accused devices have the same or equivalent_structure as the connectors disclosed in the patent
however smiths concedes that the relevant structure disclosed in the patent is the squeeze_bag
the only elements in the accused devices that correspond to this limitation are the squeeze_bag of the code_blue_device and the` breathing_tube' of the 7100mm
these elements clearly do not literally meet the disputed limitation
the squeeze_bag of the code_blue does not have first and second_openings` at opposite_ends' ; they are on the same side
moreover no reasonable fact finder could conclude that the solid breathing_tube of the 7100mm is structurally equivalent to a flexible squeeze_bag
these elements also do not meet the disputed limitation under the doctrine of equivalents
because the openings of the code_blue are on the same ends smiths infringement argument would completely eradicate the` opposite end' limitation from the claims ; it is thus precluded as a matter of law
see warner-jenkinson co. v. hilton davis chem co. 520_u.s._17 39_n._8 117_s.ct._1040 1053_n._8 137_l.ed.2d_146 41_uspq2d_1865 1875_n._8_(1997)` [ i ] f a theory of equivalence would entirely vitiate a particular claim element partial or complete judgment should be rendered by the court as there would be no further material issue for the jury to resolve'
( emphasis deleted
because the breathing_tube of the 7100mm is not a structural equivalent under ¡± 112 ?
6 and because the tube is not an` after-arising' component in relation to *1361 the date of the patent infringement under the doctrine of equivalents is again precluded
see chiuminatta_concrete_concepts inc. v. cardinal_indus. inc. 145_f.3d_1303 1311 46_uspq2d_1752 1758 fed.cir.1998

apparently realizing that these elements in the accused devices do not meet the disputed limitation smiths attempts to urge a finding of infringement when there is none by pointing to the connectors see diagrams supra as the infringing structure
not only is such a theory specious given the more obvious relevance of the squeeze_bag and the breathing_tube to the disputed limitation but the theory again fails for an obvious lack of structural equivalence
a solid connector is not structurally equivalent to a squeeze_bag and therefore does not come within the disputed ¡± 112 ?
6 limitation either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents
see chiuminatta supra

the majority bends over backwards to try to accommodate this far-fetched infringement theory by effectively broadening the disclosure corresponding to the disputed limitation under ¡± 112 ?
6
see maj. op.at 1358` thus the941 specification suggests at least three different_characteristics that inform how the disclosed squeeze [ ] bag is ameans for supplying gas first as a flexible_bag that can be squeezed to provide pressure for forcing air to the patient ; second as a hollow_structure through which gas passes on its way to the patient ; and third as a reservoir for collecting oxygen or other_gas that will be delivered to the patient`
the majority believes that consideration on remand of one of these disclosed` characteristics' may warrant a finding that the connector is an infringement
i disagree
in the end all three` characteristics' relate to but one structure the squeeze_bag disclosed in the patent
section 112 ?
6 directs consideration to whether an element of an accused device is the same or structurally equivalent to the disclosed structure which corresponds to the claimed function not to the operative characteristics of the disclosed structure
smiths should not be able to ignore the structural characteristics of the squeeze_bag and focus on its function

i therefore see no need for a remand
i would thus affirm the district_courts grant of summary judgment that neither the code_blue nor the 7100mm devices literally infringes the941_patent and the courts judgment that neither device infringes under the doctrine of equivalents

in its opinion the district_court did not analyze infringement by the mm 7100 under the doctrine of equivalents
however because the court interpreted claim_limitation 4 a to require a means for supplying gas under pressure it may have determined that the mm 7100 could not infringe under the doctrine of equivalents because it has no squeezebag
see smith_indus. 4 f.supp.2d at 749 finding that the` way' the941 invention operates is through` the delivery of air or oxygen forcefully to the patients [ sic ] mouth through the use of a squeeze_bag` emphasis added

we note that vital_signs has not raised a cross-appeal on this issue
* i understand the district_court to have found noninfringement of the 7100mm under the doctrine of equivalents even though it was not specifically discussed by the district_court in its post-trial opinion
