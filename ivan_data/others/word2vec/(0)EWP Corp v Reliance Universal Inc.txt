*900 background
ewp corporation is an ohio_corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of price brothers company a major manufacturer of reinforced concrete_pipe machinery for making pipe and wire_mesh used as reinforcing material in concrete_pipe
la_societe_trefilunion assignee of the francois_patent in suit is a french corporation operating in france and is also a manufacturer of wire reinforcing mesh

appellant exposaic is a north carolina corporation that manufactures welded wire_mesh intended for use as reinforcing material for concrete_products including concrete_pipe but it does not itself manufacture concrete_pipe
appellant reliance is an ohio_corporation that manufactures concrete_pipe and purchases wire_mesh reinforcing material from exposaic

ewp is the exclusive licensee of trefilunion with the right to grant sublicenses and to bring suit in its own name against any infringer of the036_patent which is entitled` lattice for the reinforcement of tubular concrete elements having a socket [ ] method for producing said lattice and the products obtained'
it discloses a method for producing wire_mesh reinforced concrete_pipes having a socket or bell that forms a flared end suitable for mating with the straight end of an adjacent pipe and the product produced thereby but claims only the method of producing the wire_reinforcement

the single_claim of the patent reads a method for producing a reinforcement having a socket for a reinforced concrete tubular element having a socket from a lattice having warp_wires and weft_wires and wherein a number of the warp_wires have successive deformed non-rectilinear portions the deformations of said portions being permanent and such that upon exertion of tensile_stress_thereon said portions can be at least partially straightened whereas the other warp_wires and all the weft_wires are rectilinear said method comprising in a first stage forming a prereinforcement by bending and closing onto themselves in the form of welded rings the transverse_wires of a section of said lattice said section being such that the transverse_wires corresponding to the socket and only these wires have a succession of permanently deformed nonrectilinear_portions so that they have an apparent_perimeter equal to the perimeter of the nondeformed transverse_wires of the rest of the prereinforcement but a real length substantially greater than said perimeter then in a second_stage radially expanding the prereinforcement so as to elongate at least partially said nonrectilinear_portions of the transverse_wires of its socket and impart thereto an apparent_perimeter which is substantially greater than that of the rest of the prereinforcement and corresponds to that of the desired socket of the reinforcement

figures 1 2 and 3 of the036_patent are reproduced below

*901. ?
as shown the flat lattice or mesh a of fig._1 has warp_wires 1_and_2 and weft_wires 3 intersecting at right angles and being welded together at their intersections
this lattice is bent and welded into a cylindrical_form or prereinforcement shown as b in fig._2
transverse circular rings 1a and 2a are formed from the warp_wires 1_and_2 of the mesh
warp wires 2a have convolutions corrugations or other nonrectilinear_portions such that these rings can be expanded in diameter by use of appropriate apparatus and undergo an increase in circumference as shown in fig._3
the claimed method is thus a procedure for producing such a reinforcement cage
fig._3 also shows in section a portion of concrete_pipe t poured and molded around the cage thereby forming a pipe with a tubular body having a mean diameter d extending from a to b and a socket_portion e

the preamble section of the patent specification states that reinforcing concrete_pipe with welded wire lattices was known but that with respect to reinforcing the socket_portion since the` best_steels do not have sufficient_elongation_characteristics to permit a large_expansion without fracture' two situations existed
first reinforcement of the socket_portion had been avoided or second reinforcements had been made in two parts one for the pipe body and a wider part for the socket the two parts being connected by wires
the patentees invention is then described in summary fashion by the following language which closely resembles that of the claim the object of the present invention is to overcome these drawbacks
the invention provides a lattice of welded metal wires wherein a number of the warp_wires have successive deformed nonrectilinear_portions the deformations of said portions being permanent and such that upon exertion of tensile_stress_thereon said portions can be at least partially straightened whereas the other warp_wires and all the weft_wires are rectilinear
owing to their deformed portions which may form folds waves fractions of a coil or any other sinuosities or convolutions it is possible to elongate the corresponding warp_wires and the lattice can undergo in the portion pertaining to these wires an expansion in the direction in which the warp_wires extend
*902 after expanding extensively on this broad statement of the invention the specification then explains the conversion of the lattice into the finished reinforcement for a section of concrete_pipe as follows now let is [ sic ] be assumed that it is required to construct a reinforcement for a concrete tubular element t having a socket e fig._3
there is cut from the lattice according to the invention a section_a fig._1 whose dimensions correspond to the [ sic ] those of the reinforcement to be embodied in this pipe or tubular element t. this section can be cut at the site of construction of the pipes from a roll of lattice or in a factory and delivered to the site in the flat condition

?
?
?
the section_a of lattice is bent and welded in the form of cylindrical blank or prereinforcement b fig._2
* * *

?
?
?
in order to change from the cylindrical prereinforcement b shown in fig 2 to the final reinforcement c shown in fig._3 the prereinforcement b is mounted on a [ sic ] expanding machine for expanding the rings 2a
this expansion is achieved by means of a known apparatus such as an expansible_mandrel controlled by hydraulic pneumatic or mechanical means and inserted in the rings 2a
by means of it is [ sic ] apparatus only the corrugated rings 2a are expanded and undergo both a mechanical circumferential elongation owing to the straightening of the corrugations or other deformations and an intrinsec [ sic ] elongation that is an elongation in the fibers of the metal
[ emphasis ours ]
after this expansion step the` second_stage' of the method claim the convoluted_wire_rings 2a of fig._2 become the similar but somewhat less convoluted_wire_rings 2b of fig._3 of enlarged diameter

in the prosecution of the application for the patent in suit in the patent and trademark office pto the examiner cited only two prior_art_references a laswell patent and a whitacre et al
patent neither of which is relied on in this suit with respect to the validity of the claim in suit
the latter patent is on a machine for making welded helical wire pipe or post reinforcement cages capable of making cages of varying diameter
laswell is even farther afield being a wire structure used as spacer in composite metal vehicle floor panels not made of concrete
the patent does clearly disclose however the technique of first crimping a wire_reinforcement and thereafter lengthening the wire by putting the crimped_wire under tension to remove the crimp

having considered the careful review of the prior_art by the district_court and the briefs in this court we set forth below what appears to us to be the prior_art most relevant to the method claimed in the patent in suit

german_patent 694086 was issued ausgegeben 25_july_1940 and received in the u.s. pto november 12 1940
it relates to the making of hollow reinforced concrete_bodies such as pipes among other things containing longitudinal iron reinforcing rods which are connected together by` transverse reinforcements'
figs
1_and_2 of the patent are reproduced

*903. ?
?
fig
( abb
1 shows reinforcing` cage wires' to use appellees term a being the longitudinal wires and c the` transverse reinforcement consisting of corrugated spiral wire'
in other words the transverse member c is a` corrugated wire' wrapped spirally around the long wires a
in the process described in this patent a hollow member such as a pipe is made of two layers in a mold
first an outer layer is formed and the cage is placed inside it and then pressed outwardly-expanded-by a mandrel or` press core' into the first_layer of wet concrete
the process is shown in figs
5_and_7 redrawings of which we take from appellees brief

?
?
fig._5 shows a lined mold h -i a first_layer of concrete_b and the cage elements a c. the cage is being pressed outwardly into the concrete_b by a tapered mandrel g. fig._7 shows the same after cage a c has been expanded and a second layer of concrete_b2 laid over and pressed into it by the mandrel
the patent says g is a` press *904 core which is conically or cylindrically extensible'
it also states significantly for this case` it is essential for the new invention to use extensible transverse reinforcements [ c ] which connect the long iron inserts [ a ]'
( our emphasis
and again` the process consists in that after formation of the outer concrete wall the reinforcing rings * * * corrugated overall are expanded by internal pressure without springing back upon which the internal concrete wall is formed'

the other most relevant prior_art in our view is french_patent 1,474,698 issued to the german firm sudweststahl g.m.b.h. entitled` lattice reinforcement for reinforced concrete construction' and disclosing a wide variety of reinforcing elements or structures which may be prefabricated and` permitting modification of the distance between reinforcing bars within determined limits'
below are some of the more pertinent illustrations followed by related statements from the specification

?
in the above figures longitudinal reinforcing members are shown at 21¡¬ 23¡¬ 35 44 48 and transverse or linking wires having a variety of bends undulations or zigzags to permit extension at 31¡¬ 34 42 43 and 46
the following general statements are from the specification according to the invention two or more reinforcing elements such as mutually parallel bars are interconnected such that a lateral displacement of these bars with respect to each other is possible to match the reinforcing element to the desired dimensions ; for transportation requirements the individual elements can be compressed such that the bars touch each other
the linking elements are flexible but nevertheless rigid enough
they are composed of wires or strips which can be welded to the reinforcement bars crimped tied or fixed in some other appropriate manner for example by means of a movable sleeve or by another like piece
the linking elements in the form of wire or of flat strips maintain the bars at a controllable and determined mutual spacing and can likewise have one or more folds i.e. can be folded in a zigzag *905 form so as to be more or less stretched according to the desired distance between the reinforcing bars to be connected together

?
?
?
in place of zigzag linking elements provided with folds it is possible to utilize spiral linking elements which in their length can be extended or compressed to a greater or lesser extent in order to keep the reinforcing bars at the predetermined desired distance
[ emphasis ours ]

although diametrical expansion of reinforcement rings is not expressly disclosed the use of the reinforcements for pipe was not remote from the thinking of this patentee
the following appears to reinforce pipes a reinforcing element according to the invention can likewise be used
in such an element the closed rings mutually parallel and embodied as reinforcing bars are kept together by the linking elements such that the distance between the rings can be regulated to a determined value preferably by twisting them
[ emphasis ours ]
fig._1 9 below is a reinforcing element for pipes as described in the preceding paragraph
having no crimped_wires it is not particularly relevant here but is included for completeness

?
in discussing this reference the trial judge closely tracking the testimony of appellees professorial patent expert witness dr. starkey instead of applying the more relevant teachings of this patent to the issue of obviousness concentrated on fig._1 9 because it related to pipe
he then found` significant_differences' between the francois_invention and the invention of french698 saying the latter has` flexiblelinking elements' whereas francois has` no linking elements as such' although the crimped_wires of francois shown as 2 2a and 2b supra link the longitudinal initially parallel wires 3 which in the words of french698` can be.. more or less stretched according to the desired distance between the reinforcing bars'
compare figs
2_and_3 of the patent in suit supra where the lower ends of the bars 3 have been moved farther apart by stretching the crimped_wires from the 2a to the 2b size
it is not fig._1 9 that is significant in this case but the other clear teachings of the reference
the` expert' testimony misdirected the courts thinking

opinion
the obviousness question
whether the single_claim of the francois_patent in suit is valid under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 is a question of law and that question is freely reviewable by this court
graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 17 86_s.ct._684 693 15_l.ed.2d_545 148_uspq_459 467 1966 ; gardner v. tec systems inc. 725_f.2d_1338 1344 220_uspq_777 782 fed.cir.1984
the pto examiner did not cite the german or french698_patent s against the036_patent application
therefore in considering obviousness we have no pto view before us on obviousness in view of those references and appellants burden of proof under 35 u.s.c.¡± 282 is more easily carried
american hoist & derrick co. v. sowa & sons inc. 725_f.2d_1350 1359 220_uspq_763 770 fed.cir.1984
it is our view that the claim is invalid because its subject_matter would have been obvious to a person having ordinary_skill in the wire_reinforcement_art at the time the invention was made

the district judge made what appears to be a detailed and careful analysis of the prior_art and indeed we agree with much of it including his discarding of several prior_art_references on various grounds as lacking pertinence
the bases of our disagreement *906 are few but fundamental and fairly simple
in explaining them we shall discuss only the most relevant prior_art_references and the teachings of the francois_patent itself
speaking generally the district_courts opinion in its discussion under the heading` ii
nonobviousness' takes what we deem to be an erroneous_approach to the issue in comparing the francois_invention with the prior_art
in the first place the approach seems to regard the invention as tied to the making of concrete_bell and spigot_pipe and to appraise the pertinence of each reference individually on that basis
as we view the method of the single_claim in suit however it is not a method of making concrete_pipe of bell and spigot type or otherwise notwithstanding the reference in the claim to` reinforced concrete'
the method pertains only to making a wire_reinforcement of tubular or cylindrical_form an end portion of which can be enlarged in diameter if desired by stretching

a major portion of the` prior_art' under ¡± 103 is actually recited in the francois_patent
* it is there explained that` it is already known to employ a lattice for reinforcing concrete tubular elements..' for what is meant by the term` lattice' see fig._1 supra
it is next stated that` the best_steels do not have sufficient_elongation_characteristics to permit a large_expansion without fracture'
that is to say the lattice made into tubular form and welded can not be stretched enough to fit bell and spigot_pipe without breaking some circular wires
that was the problem faced by francois
his solution was to include in the part of the lattice he wished to enlarge` a number of warp_wires [ which ] have successive deformed nonrectilinear_portions'
with them the patent states` it is possible to elongate the.. warp_wires and the lattice can undergo in the portion pertaining to these wires an expansion in the direction in which the warp_wires extend'
to produce the desired expansion the cylindrical cage fig._2 is` mounted on a [ sic ] expanding machine..
this expansion is achieved by means of a known apparatus such as an expansible_mandrel..'

it would be going too far as a matter of patent law to agree with appellants brief that the` solution to the problem of wire breakage would seem to be dictated by the most elementary common sense'
but we can say the solution would have been obvious to the hypothetical person of ordinary_skill postulated by 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 if we find evidence of prior_art which shows he would have been presumed to know that the way to make a reinforcing wire expansible is to corrugate or crimp it
see kimberly-clark corp. v. johnson & johnson 745_f.2d_1437 1449 223_uspq_603 614 fed.cir.1984
german_patent 604,086 is such evidence and further evidence is provided in french_patent698
we can express full agreement with the following statement in the trial_courts opinion it can not be denied that the francois_invention is strikingly simple
yet simple and obvious are not synonymous terms
it is perceived that the invention depends for its successful operation upon two simple principles a steel wire of a given length can be deformed or bent into a smaller apparent length and then later be stretched back closer to its original length ; and further if the deformed wire is bent into a circle before it is stretched the stretching will result in a circle with a larger diameter
of all the prior_art_references relied on by defendants the german086_patent clearly exhibits the greatest similarity to the francois_invention
as noted the german_patent discloses a wire lattice reinforcement for concrete whose circumferential *907 wires are corrugated and thus` extensible'
the german_patent like the francois_patent then discloses the use of a mandrel to exert radial force upon these circumferential_wires for the purpose of stretching them and expanding their circumference
these aspects of the german_patent and the francois_patent are thus in principle the same
what the law requires us to disagree with is the trial_courts disregard of the clear teaching of the german_patent to corrugate or crimp wires which one wishes to expand or stretch because of` significant_differences' it found` between the german invention and the francois_invention'
( our emphasis
that was the erroneous_approach of appellees expert witness
the court said` unlike the francois_patent the german_patent discloses nothing with respect to the formation of a socket or bell
all of the circumferential_wires are corrugated.. to the same extent'
and so on
such differences are irrelevant
a reference must be considered for everything it teaches by way of technology and is not limited to the particular invention it is describing and attempting to protect
on the issue of obviousness the combined teachings of the prior_art as a whole must be considered

we can not escape the conclusion that francois did no more than apply the presumed knowledge of the art to provide an obvious solution to a simple problem use crimped_wire where there is a need in a subsequent forming step to expand or stretch it
that presumed knowledge was of course available to all
it is irrelevant whether or not francois was aware of it
patentability under the statute ¡± 103 is a decision made on the basis of a hypothesis would the invention have been obvious` to a person having ordinary_skill in the art to which the subject_matter pertains' in the light of all knowledge conveyed by` prior_art' as defined by statute and case law
it is a decision which must be made by courts because the law assigns that task to them
the function of witnesses expert and otherwise is to assist the court in determining and comprehending facts

the trial_court properly undertook to decide upon the level of ordinary_skill in the art a point upon which neither party introduced evidence
in doing so it clearly erred in assuming that the involved art is making reinforced concrete_products
considering the invention here claimed we see it as a narrower field the making of reinforcing wire cages and the like
we mention it only because the view that concrete technology is involved seems to have been the basis for finding several references not pertinent because they did not relate to concrete_pipe or even more specifically bell and spigot_pipe
this was a ground for effectively ignoring the relevant teaching of the german_patent because the concrete_body was different made by a different process and` there is no disclosure of a socket of increased diameter at one end'
that is of no moment
its significance is in its teaching that when a wire reinforcing cage is to be expanded the wires undergoing stretching should be crimped or in the words of the claim in suit provided with` successive deformed non-rectilinear portions' which means the same thing

in reaching our conclusion that the invention claimed would have been obvious we have considered the evidence and arguments pertaining to the so-called` secondary_considerations' such as commercial success licensing adoption by the industry etc
upon full consideration of all the evidence we remain convinced that it presents a clear and very strong_case of obviousness based on admissions and the teachings of the new_references above considered

when as happened here the pto issues a patent because the examiner did not consider prior_art teaching the very technique essential to the claimed invention-crimping of wire which is to be stretched later-it is not unusual to see astute businessmen capitalize on it by erecting a temporarily successful licensing program thereon
such programs are not infallible guides to patentability
they sometimes succeed because they are mutually beneficial to the licensed group or because *908 of business judgments that it is cheaper to take licenses than to defend infringement suits or for other reasons unrelated to the unobviousness of the licensed subject_matter
such a` secondary consideration' must be carefully appraised as to its evidentiary value and we have tried to do that here

concluding that the patent is invalid under ¡± 103 we deem it unnecessary to reach the other issues of infringement inducing infringement contributory_infringement damages etc

for the foregoing reasons the decision below is reversed

reversed

davis circuit_judge concurring i join judge_richs opinion but write separately because of the need to explain more in detail why to my mind the` secondary_considerations' do not in this case outbalance the` clear and very strong_case of obviousness based on admissions and the teachings of the new_references' as the majority opinion properly puts it
the district court found a` convincing evidence' that the invention involved here` filled a long felt and serious need in the reinforced concrete_pipe industry' ; b this invention had a strong impact on that industry in this country in that` virtually every manufacturer of wire_mesh' for this kind of pipe not only sought and obtained a license but also abandoned prior_art methods of bending and welding bells in reinforcement cages ; and c there was sufficient motivation and effort toward discovering a new method but this was not accomplished for a considerable period of time

appellants correctly point out that these findings particularly those as to the supplanting of prior methods are overstated but there can be no doubt that the invention of the036_patent became very successful and has been much used
nevertheless i agree that this ample fulfillment of need does not prevail to show non-obviousness
first as judge_richs opinion shows the invention was very very clearly foreshadowed by the pertinent_teachings of the german and french_patents
second it seems to me not significant though the trial_court thought it very important that the invention` was n't developed sooner'
the simple fact probably is that those teachings of the german and french_patents were actually not well-known even in the pertinent art but under the settled rule of ¡± 103 that fact is irrelevant-they were still part-and-parcel of the prior_art even if they were not in fact well-known in the united states ; they are an integral part of the` presumed` knowledge
to me this lag between` actual knowledge' and` presumed knowledge' not legal non-obviousness-together with the consideration mentioned by judge_rich near the end of his opinion-adequately explains the delay in the utilization of the invention
third the quick acceptance of the invention once it was disclosed in this country should be explained on the same basis
if the pertinent_teachings of the german and french_patents had been widely circulated to the wire_reinforcement_art in this country immediately after those patents issued abroad i judge that the invention at issue would have been made very much earlier and would have attained like success
these are the reasons in my view why the` secondary_considerations' fail to overcome the very strong_case of obviousness from the admissions and the teachings of the references considered in the prevailing opinion

* appellees brief makes the same point in arguing that the best prior_art was therefore before the pto
but it must be considered under ¡± 103 in conjunction with art that was not before the pto in deciding whether the claimed invention would or would not have been obvious-a legal conclusion which is not based on the operation of francois brain but is the courts appraisal of what would have been obvious to one of ordinary_skill in the art aware of the disclosures of all of the prior_art
