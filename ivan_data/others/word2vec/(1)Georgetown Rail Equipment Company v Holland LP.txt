background
i
the patented technology
the329_patent generally relates to a` system and method for inspecting railroad_tracks' with the use of digital_technology
'329_patent abstract
specifically it discloses a system for inspecting tie_plates which are steel plates that connect the steel rail tracks to wooden_ties
id
col. 2_ll._19 -31 ; j.a
928
tie plates can sink or cut into the wooden_ties and disrupt railroad service
'329_patent abstract
the329_patent purportedly improves the *1234 prior_art by automating the examination of misaligned tie_plates a process that was historically performed manually with certain software systems
see id
col. 1_l._39 -col. 2_l._6_(describing_the_prior_art)

claim 16 the only asserted claim recites a system for inspecting a railroad_track_bed including the railroad_track to be mounted on a vehicle for movement along the railroad_track the system comprising at least one light_generator positioned adjacent the railroad_track for projecting a beam of light across the railroad_track_bed ; at least one optical_receiver positioned adjacent the railroad_track for receiving at least a portion of the light reflected from the railroad_track_bed and generating a plurality of images representative of the profile of at least a portion of the railroad_track_bed ; and.at least one processor for analyzing the plurality of images and determining one or more_physical_characteristics of the said portion of the railroad_track_bed the one or more_physical_characteristics comprising at least a geographic location of the plurality of images along the railroad_track_bed wherein the processor includes an algorithm for detecting a misaligned or sunken tie_plate of the railroad_track_bed the algorithm comprising the steps of a analyzing a frame of the plurality of images the frame comprising a region of interest ; b determining whether the region of interest contains a tie_plate ; c if a tie_plate is present determining a crosstie_contour and a tie_plate_contour ; d comparing an orientation of the crosstie_contour and an orientation of the tie_plate_contour ; and
( e determining whether the tie_plate is misaligned or sunken based upon the comparison

ii
relevant facts and procedural history
holland purchases track and crosstie measuring technologies from rail_vision_systems j.a
1072-73 and then places those technologies on its own track inspection_vehicles called trackstar vehicles j.a
1564
data from the track is collected and then may be sent to third-party companies for example rail_vision_europe_ltd. a company based in the united kingdom for data_processing
see georgetown_rail_ii 2016_wl_3346084 at *6
rail_vision_europe_ltd. then sends finished reports back to holland for distribution to hollands customers
id.at *5-6 ; see j.a
1103-04

georgetown markets similar products that practice the329_patent as part of its aurora_track_inspection_system
j.a
850
specifically the aurora_track_inspection_system uses lasers and cameras mounted on a hi-rail vehicle to collect and process information about track_ties
j.a
817-19
the purpose of these types of systems is generally to allow customers to use the processed data to` manage the logistics of crosstie replacement and to quantify the need for new crossties'
'329_patent col. 1_ll._39 -40 ; see j.a
1102-03

holland and georgetown knew of each others place in the track-tie market
in january 2012 both companies participated in a` head-to-head challenge' in which they demonstrated their services to potential customer union_pacific railroad` union_pacific'
georgetown_rail_ii 2016_wl_3346084 at *3 citations omitted
following *1235 the demonstrations union_pacific and holland entered into a change order agreement` change_order' to alter an existing contract between holland and union_pacific to allow holland to provide rail_vision_systems_technology to union_pacific on an as needed basis
id
; appellants br

the change_order was signed for a particular number of years and included compensatory amounts for actual quantities of work performed upon union_pacifics request
appellants br
25-26 ; j.a
10742

georgetown sued holland for infringement in 2013 and was granted a preliminary_injunction in january 2014 ending any of hollands potential sales to union_pacific under the change_order
georgetown_rail_ii 2016_wl_3346084 at *3
the parties proceeded to a jury_trial and the jury found that holland willfully infringed the329_patent and awarded $ 1,541,333 in damages
id
the district_court then denied hollands motion for jmol and awarded georgetown an additional $ 1,000,000 in enhanced_damages based on a finding of willful_infringement pursuant to 35 u.s.c.¡± 284 2012

discussion
holland raises four issues on appeal
first holland challenges the district_courts finding that the term` mounted on a vehicle for movement along the railroad_track' in the preamble of claim 16 is not a claim_limitation
appellants br
62-66
second holland challenges the jurys infringement finding
id.at 33-45
third holland challenges the district_courts approval of the jurys award of lost profits
id.at 45-58
fourth holland argues that we should reverse the district_courts award of enhanced_damages
id.at 58-62
we address these issues in turn

i
claim construction
at the district_court holland argued that the phrase` mounted on a vehicle for movement along the railroad_track' in the preamble of claim 16 was a claim_limitation such that hollands product which did not have a processor capable of mounting on a vehicle could not infringe
georgetown_rail_i 2014_wl_11498109 at *2
the district_court rejected this argument for four reasons
first it found that the term did not recite an` essential_structure' of the invention because the specification also included the phrase` [ a ] lternatively the computer_analysis can be performed by another computer_system having image_processing_software known in the art'329_patent col. 7_ll._12 -14 such that the system need not be performed in a vehicle georgetown_rail_i 2014_wl_11498109 at *2-3
second it found that for the same_reason the phrase could not recite` additional_structure or steps.. underscored as important by the specification'
id.at *3 capitalization omitted
third it found that the term was not an` antecedent_basis' for the claim_terms because` [ t ] he claim_body neither in whole [ n ] or in part mentions the phrasemounted on a vehicle
`` id
finally it found that georgetown did not clearly rely on the limitation during prosecution because the cited statements from the prosecution_history did not` distinguish the claimed invention from the prior_art by reference to the system being mounted on a vehicle'
id.at *4

a
standard of review and legal_standard
we review the district_courts ultimate construction of the claim_language *1236 de novo

b
the district_court properly found the preamble is not limiting
in the context of the entire patent it is apparent that the term` mounted on a vehicle for movement along the railroad_track' is meant to describe the principal *1237 intended use of the invention but not to import a structural limitation or to exclude from the reach of the claims an assembly that does not include a vehicle mount
nothing in the specification or prosecution_history states or even suggests that georgetown intended to exclude use of technology that was structurally identical to its claimed product but that was installed and performed analysis on a non-vehicle mount
see generally329_patent ; see j.a
10967 11034 11043 11057-58 11067 11070 11078 11092-94329_patent prosecution_history
the body of the claim itself describes a` structurally complete_invention' rowe 112 f.3d at 478 because it describes a closed` system' comprised of a` light_generator'` optical_receiver' and` processor' which are the objects required to perform the stated purposes of gathering and processing data on misaligned track_ties329_patent col. 11_ll._42 43 46 51 ; see id. abstract col. 2_ll._13 -34 summary of the disclosure
the location of the system is not an essential feature of the invention
indeed as the district_court noted the specification states that` [ t ] he computer_analysis can be performed by the processing_device.. located on the inspection_vehicle
alternatively the computer_analysis can be performed by another computer_system having image_processing_software known in the art'
georgetown_rail_i 2014_wl_11498109 at *2-3 quoting329_patent col. 7_ll._10 -14

hollands arguments do not require us to reach a different conclusion
first holland argues that the specification describes all embodiments of the invention as vehicle-based such that the phrase is` underscored as important' by the specification
appellants br
63 internal_quotation_marks and citation omitted
holland is incorrect
the specification states that the disclosed inspection_system` can be mounted on an inspection_vehicle.. or other device moving along the track so as to maintain the inspection_system.. in the proper position'
'329_patent col. 3_ll._55 -57 emphasis added
it gives additional options that are not vehicle mounts as well such as mounting the system on a` chassis that is towed by a vehicle' or on a` locomotive' or` freight car'
id
col. 4_ll._7 -8
the specification also uses the verb` can be' indicating an option rather than a requirement
id
col. 3_l._54
moreover the specification describes the patented_invention as the system itself noting that to mount the system` it is understood that other known components.. may be needed' but do not form the basis for the patented_invention
id
col. 3_ll._59 -60
as the district_court noted the specification explicitly states that the relevant computation and processing of the data using the patented algorithms and the processing_device respectively also do not need to be performed on or affixed to a vehicle
georgetown_rail_i 2014_wl_11498109 at *2-3 ; see329_patent col. 7_ll._10 -14
for these reasons the phrase` mounted on a vehicle for movement along the railroad_track' can not be a part of the essential_structure of the invention or a` fundamental characteristic' required for any part of the claims
poly-am. l.p. v. gse lining tech. inc. 383_f.3d_1303 1310 fed
cir
2004

hollands second argument that the preamble is` essential' to understand limitations in the claim_body appellants br
66 internal_quotation_marks and citation omitted fails for the same_reason
contrary to hollands assertion the system described in the claim_body and in the specification is structurally complete without the disclosure of how the technology moves over the tracks
holland argues as an example of the need to include the preamble in the claim_language that the claim_terms` plurality of images' and light_generator and cameras that are` positioned *1238 adjacent' to the track would not make sense without the preamble
id
( internal_quotation_marks omitted
this puts the caboose before the locomotive
it is easy to imagine that the patented system could be manually carried or pulled across tracks and that software configured in any type of device on-site or off could process the data
these claim_terms still would apply because the system i.e. the` lasers cameras and a processor'329_patent col. 2_ll._14 -15 still would generate a` plurality of images' using a light_generator and cameras that are` positioned adjacent' to the track id
col. 11_ll._43 -48
such a preamble is not limiting` where a patentee defines a structurally complete_invention in the claim_body and uses the preamble only to state a purpose or intended use for the invention'
catalina mktg. 289 f.3d at 808 internal_quotation_marks and citation omitted

finally holland argues that georgetown relied upon the preamble during prosecution to distinguish the invention from the prior_art
appellants br
66-67
holland relies upon georgetowns statements that various prior_art references teach away from the329_patent because the prior_art did not teach` analyzing or determining.. characteristics.. along the railroad_track_bed' j.a
11092 internal_quotation_marks and emphasis omitted` utiliz [ ing ] physical track measurements to position the system' j.a
11058 or` correlat [ ing ] measured surface characteristics to geographic measured locations along roadway/rail surfaces' j.a
11034
however none of these statements distinguish the patented_invention from the prior_art based on the mounting of the data processor part of the invention onto a vehicle
ambiguous statements made during prosecution especially those that do not directly distinguish the element claimed as essential for purposes of finding a limitation in the preamble` can not fairly limit the characteristics of the claim_term'
grober v. mako prods. inc. 686_f.3d_1335 1342 fed
cir
2012
for these reasons we hold that the district_court properly found the preamble does not limit the asserted claim_term

ii
infringement
at the district_court holland argued that it could not have infringed because it` did not benefit from or control' the purported infringing technology
georgetown_rail_ii 2016_wl_3346084 at *5
in denying hollands request for jmol the district_court found that` holland has provided no basis for the [ district ] court to reevaluate the evidence' because` [ a ] reasonable_jury could find that holland exercised control of and benefited from' its infringing rail_vision_systems_device regardless of the fact that a third_party rail_vision_europe_ltd. processed the gathered data

b
the district_court did not err in denying_jmol for infringement
holland presents two theories why it has not directly infringed the329_patent pursuant to 35 u.s.c.¡± 271 a3 first it alleges that` [ n ] o reasonable_jury could have found that hollandused.. the allegedly infringing data_processing equipment'
appellants br
34 ; see id.at 34-41
second it claims that no reasonable_jury could have found that it` offer [ ed ] to sell' the entire invention covered by the329_patent as required under a separate theory of infringement
id.at 42 internal_quotation_marks and citation omitted ; see id.at 42-45
because we resolve this question on the first theory argued by holland we need not address hollands arguments related to the offer to sell
see novartis ag v. noven pharm. inc. 853_f.3d_1289 1296 fed
cir
2017

in centillion this court addressed infringement of a system_claim on information technology
the claim recited a` front-end' system maintained by an end user and a` back-end' system maintained by a service provider
centillion 631 f.3d at 1281
the facts of the case were that customers of the company accused of infringing used the companys front-end client application software to trigger data_processing by the companys back-end_system
see id.at 1281-82
relevant to this case we held that the companys customers` used' the entire system for purposes of ¡± 271 a because the customers entered informational queries into the front-end and these queries caused the back-end to perform additional processing as required by the patent claim
id.at 1285
importantly we held that` [ i ] t makes no difference that the back-end_processing is physically possessed by' a third_party
id

hollands use of rail_vision_systemss technology is analogous to the system found` used' for purposes of the infringement analysis in centillion
as in centillion holland collects and gathers data by its system platform on the front-end
j.a
1137-39
then holland sends the gathered information to a back-end third-party company with instructions to process and analyze the information
j.a
1106 1139-40
the fact that the transmission from the front-end to the back-end in this case involves` physically remov [ ing ] the hard drives with data.. and ship [ ping ] them *1240 overseas to rail vision [ europe ltd. ]' is of no consequence
appellants br
38 citing j.a
1103-04
the intermediary steps are still` put into service' as a result of hollands front-end collection and request for processing demonstrating hollands ultimate control of and derivation of benefit from the system
see centillion 631 f.3d at 1285
holland would have us look to the part of centillion that found the back-end processor had not infringed because it only supplied software for the customer to use on the front-end
appellants br
39-40
however this analogy overlooks the finding of infringing use by the companys customers who were actively using and requesting the analysis of their data
j.a
1126-27 1139-40
here holland acts like the customers in centillion-its trucks gather and collect the data and it makes the choice to send collected information to the third-party rail_vision_europe_ltd. for processing

holland argues that as a factual matter it may have collected and shipped the raw data to rail_vision_europe_ltd. but it has not been proven that holland actually ever gathered any data that was sent for processing
appellants br
34-37 ; see oral arg.at 3:45-4:09 http //oralarguments.cafc.uscourts.gov/default.aspx ? fl=2016-2297.mp3
specifically holland points to a line in the district_court opinion stating that` hollands 2012 demonstration in yuma is a use of the rail_vision_systems' appellants br
20 quoting georgetown_rail_ii 2016_wl_3346084 at *5 and alleges that there is` no evidence that any data collected during the yuma_demonstration was processed by anyone' id.at 34
regardless of whether the information shown at the yuma_demonstration was ever processed by rail_vision_europe_ltd. hollands expert affirmatively stated several times on the record that holland has collected data and has directed rail_vision_systems to process the collected data
see j.a
1135 1138-39 1141 1143-44 ; see also j.a
1103 1106 similar4 as such a reasonable_jury could find evidence supporting its conclusion that holland infringed georgetowns329_patent by putting all elements of the infringing system into use
that is all that is required to uphold the jury finding of infringement

iii
the district_court did not err in denying_jmol for damages based on lost_profits
holland challenges the district_courts denial of jmol on lost profits damages
at trial georgetown asserted that hollands infringing sales of data collected and analyzed from the rail_vision_systems_technology caused it to lose profits that it otherwise would have made from the329_patent
the jury awarded georgetown $ 1,541,333 in lost profits

amount of profits that would have been made
as to the fourth panduit factor holland alleges that georgetown did not submit adequate evidence to show its lost profits
id.at 53-58
georgetown submitted evidence that its lost profits_calculation was based on failure to secure a contract with union_pacific which entered into a deal with holland instead through the change_order
see georgetown_rail_ii 2016_wl_3346084 at *8 ; j.a
1600
holland contends that because it made no profit under the change_order signed with union_pacific georgetown could not have missed any potential profits
appellants br
47
it further alleges that the district_courts assumption that holland made no profit on the change_order solely due to the january 2014 preliminary_injunction preventing sales was improper speculation running contrary to actual commercial data
id.at 48

georgetowns expert calculated lost profits using the following method
first he assumed that had the change_order between holland and union_pacific not been implemented union_pacifics track maintenance business would have gone to georgetown
j.a
1608-10
second he calculated that georgetown would have inspected a certain mileage of union_pacifics track over a certain period at a prevailing market rate
j.a
1606 1610-12
third he accounted for the typical delay between the contracts effective date and the start of georgetowns hypothetical work
j.a
1610
he further stated that the per-mile_rate was on the higher end of comparable ranges because it would not have included downward pressure on price created with the entrance of the infringing technology into the current market
j.a
1599-600
fourth to calculate the length of the contract he looked at comparable contracts already entered into between georgetown and four other u.s. railway companies
see j.a
10148 10170 10179 10091 ; see also j.a
1586 1608
his proposed contract_length squarely in the middle of lengths contracted with other railroads was also the same number of years as hollands change_order with union_pacific
see j.a
10742-45.5 finally to keep the estimate within a reasonable range he did not include more speculative damages such as loss of market share or ancillary costs
j.a
1587-88 1601 1605

georgetowns expert used the same method of reviewing competitive market *1243 contracts to determine the number of miles of track to be inspected yearly and to approximate the per-mile_rates of inspection
see j.a
1585-618
both of these numbers were within the range of rates in the valid contracts georgetown maintained with other u.s. railroads
see j.a
10145 10160 10177 10198 ; see also j.a
860-63
the number used for the per-mile_rate was also the same calculation that georgetown had submitted in a revised proposal to union_pacific to use its technology in april 2012 an offer which union_pacific did not accept
j.a
973 10213
finally georgetowns expert deducted costs to arrive at the final calculation
j.a
1612-18
these cost deductions included job costs capital expenditures and deductions for net-present value using a standard discount rate
j.a
1613-18

hollands argument that the award does not reflect market or economic variables is belied by the record

georgetowns lost profits_calculation including contract_length per-mile_rate and yearly miles of track to review was based on sound economic proof confirmed by the historical record

holland did not make any such showing nor has it alleged that it made a showing of a more reasonable damages award
see generally appellants br

holland also contends that there is no but-for causation because georgetowns calculations assume that union_pacific would have ordered from georgetown ; however during the same period where union_pacific could have ordered data_collection_services` as needed' from holland under the change_order union_pacific did not purchase any services

georgetown presented evidence that the market for its laser-based track inspection services was a two-supplier market
see j.a
828 1264 1522
its expert stated that only georgetown and holland were invited to demonstrate their technologies for union_pacific j.a
890-92 and that union_pacific was interested in purchasing this technology and asked for it j.a
1592
georgetown provided further evidence that union_pacific entered into a change_order with holland that contemplated providing the services j.a
1626-27 and that union_pacific purchased a certain amount of inspection_system technologies from holland before the preliminary_injunction went into effect j.a
1179 10521-24
we conclude that there was a legally sufficient_evidentiary_basis in the record from which a reasonable_jury could have found that georgetown would have received business from union_pacific for data_collection_services if hollands infringing product was not in the market
holland presented evidence that georgetown had offered its services unsuccessfully to union_pacific prior to the relevant time period j.a
1627 ; union_pacific had not authorized work under the change_order j.a
1627-29 ; and at all times even after the change_order was signed union *1244 pacific was free to enter into a separate contract for services with georgetown j.a
10740-43 demonstrating non-exclusivity of the change_order
the jury weighed that evidence against georgetowns and found georgetowns evidence more persuasive

willfulness and enhanced_damages
the final issue before us concerns the district_courts finding of willful_infringement and its related decision to enhance damages
the district_court found in relevant_part that the jury verdict of willful_infringement was supported by substantial_evidence and that` the totality of the circumstances' warranted an award of enhanced_damages based in part on the fact that` holland continued to rely on arguments through trial that were substantially weak and rejected time and again'

b
the district_court did not err in its willfulness finding or award of enhanced_damages
holland argues that this court should reverse the finding of willful_infringement and the award of enhanced_damages because 1 there is no evidence to suggest that holland knew of the329_patent before the start of this litigation ; 2 there is no evidence to suggest that holland had access to the technical algorithms used in the329_patent such that willful copying would be impossible ; 3 it is undisputed that holland was not involved in development of the rail_vision_systems software ; and 4 holland processes its data using different software algorithms than those in the329_patent
appellants br
58-61

substantial evidence supports the jurys finding that subjective_recklessness led to willful_infringement in this case
the jury heard evidence that holland was aware of the329_patent prior to the current litigation see e.g. j.a
1180-87 1340 1384-85 ; see also j.a
1161-62 1277 and believed that it was infringing the patent
evidence to support this latter proposition included evidence of the parties prior business dealings from which the jury could have inferred that holland believed that it needed to acquire or license georgetowns aurora_system to avoid infringement see e.g. j.a
1187-88 and` circumstantial evidence that holland copied [ georgetowns ] technology' georgetown_rail_ii 2016_wl_3346084 at *17
although holland continues to dispute several of these facts the jury was free to decide whose evidence it found more compelling on the question of willfulness and found in georgetowns favor
lighting ballast control 790 f.3d at 1342
we will not disturb that finding here where substantial_evidence supports the jurys conclusions
see id

as for enhanced_damages on this record we can not conclude that the district_court abused its discretion in weighing the evidence or applying the read_factors
see i4i_ltd._p'ship 598 f.3d at 858
holland makes no specific arguments with respect to the district_courts application of the read_factors in its opening brief
see generally appellants br
in its reply brief holland states that the same arguments it makes to reverse the finding of willfulness go to certain read_factors without directly connecting its arguments to individual read_factors
reply br
28

none of the arguments holland makes with respect to the findings of enhanced_damages demonstrate abuse of discretion by the district_court
the district_court made detailed factual findings which taken together support its award of enhanced_damages
it did not merely look at the jurys finding of willfulness ; rather it applied and considered all nine read_factors
specifically after analyzing each read factor *1246 individually the district_court stated that` [ f ] actors 1 2 and 5 support enhancement ; factors 3 4 and 7 slightly support enhancement ; and factors 6 8 and 9 are neutral'
georgetown_rail_ii 2016_wl_3346084 at *21
it also found that` no single factor weighs against enhancement'
id
finally the district_court took into account the degree of willfulness and found that it was` not warranted' to enhance damages to the full maximum statutory amount of treble damages over $ 4,500,000 ; rather it awarded only an additional $ 1,000,000
id
considering all of the read_factors and the district_courts statutory authority to treble damages under ¡± 284 the award of $ 1,000,000 in addition to the damages award of $ 1,544,333 was not an abuse of discretion

conclusion
we have considered the parties remaining arguments and find them unpersuasive
accordingly the final_judgment of the u.s._district_court for the eastern_district of texas is

affirmed
