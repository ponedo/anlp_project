prost circuit_judge
this is a patent infringement case under the hatch-waxman act apotex inc. and apotex_corp. collectively` apotex' appeal the grant of summary_judgment by the united_states_district_court for the northern_district of california that the patent held by roche_palo_alto_llc and allergan inc. collectively` roche' is valid and infringed by the formulation covered by apotexs abbreviated new drug application` anda'
roche palo alto llc v. apotex inc. 526_f.supp.2d_985 n.d.cal.2007
because we find no error in the courts holding that the reverse_doctrine of equivalents is inapplicable and that claim_preclusion prohibits apotex from raising other validity_challenges we affirm

i
a. roche is the owner of u.s. patent no._5110,493` the ¡¬493_patent` which is directed to a drug formulation for treatment of eye inflammation such as that caused by glaucoma conjunctivitis eye surgery or eye injury
¡¬ 493 patent col._1,_ll._14-28
the formulation contains a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug` nsaid' such as ketorolac tromethamine` kt' ; a quaternary_ammonium_preservative such as benzalkonium chloride` bac' ; and the nonionic surfactant octoxynol 40` o40'
id. col._3,_ll._13-19 col._4,_ll._20-41
claim 1 is representative *1375 an opthalmologically acceptable non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug formulation comprising an opthamologically acceptable non-steroidal anti-inflammatory carboxyl group-containing drug in an effective_amount for ophthalmic treatment between 0.001 % and 10.00 %_wt/vol ; a quaternary_ammonium_preservative in an antimicrobially effective_amount between 0.001 % and 1.0 %_wt/vol ; an ethoxylated alkyl phenol that conforms generally to the formula c8 h17c6h4 och2-ch2 n oh where n has an average value of 40 [ o40 ] in a stabilizing amount between 0.001 % and 1.0 %_wt/vol ; and an aqueous vehicle q.s
to 100 %
dependent claim 7 further includes sodium chloride` nacl' at a concentration of 0.79 %_wt/vol

the last limitation in claim 1 requiring the presence of o40 was added in response to the examiners obviousness rejection over several prior_art references
accompanying the claim amendment the applicants submitted the lidgate_declaration which stated that o40 produced unexpected_results over other nonionic surfactants such as o3 and o5
specifically the declaration stated that o40 produced a clear solution while the others did not
the examiner allowed the claims based on the unexpected_results of o40

over the years apotex filed two different andas on two different generic drug formulations each containing a paragraph iv certification that the ¡¬493_patent is invalid unenforceable or will not be infringed by the generic_version of the drug
in 2001 apotex filed its first anda` anda-1' directed to a generic_version of roches acularthe_r
subsequently in 2005 apotex filed its second anda` anda-2' directed to a generic_version of roches acularthe_rls
the two formulations differ in their compositions as follows

anda-1

anda-2

( acularthe_r

( acularthe_rls

kt

0.5 %

0.4 %

bac

0.01 %

0.0063 %

o40

0.01 %

0.004 %

nacl

0.8 %

0.8 %

notably the concentration of o40 is reduced in the anda-2_formulation as compared to the anda-1_formulation but both are within the range claimed in claim 1 of the ¡¬493_patent
the concentration of nacl is identical in the two formulations and encompassed by at least claim1 of the patent
b
on june_6,_2001 roches predecessor syntex u.s.a. llc` syntex' sued apotex for infringement of the ¡¬493_patent based on the anda-1_formulation
the district_court issued a claim_construction order
syntex u.s.a. llc v. apotex inc. no._01-2214 n.d.cal
nov._19,_2002
because claim 1 of the ¡¬493_patent expressly states a concentration_range for o40 the court held that the claim term` stabilizing amount' is merely a statement of intended result and not a claim_limitation
id. slip op.at 9
thereafter the district_court granted syntexs motion for partial summary_judgment that the anda-1_formulation literally infringed the ¡¬493_patent
syntex u.s.a. llc v. apotex inc. no._01-2214 slip op.at 4-5 n.d.cal
mar._19,_2003
following a bench trial on apotexs invalidity defenses of lack of utility lack of enablement indefiniteness and obviousness and its unenforceablity defense based on inequitable_conduct the court held that the ¡¬493_patent was both valid and enforceable
syntex u.s.a. llc v. apotex inc. no._01-2214 n.d.cal
dec._29,_2003` syntex_i`

*1376 on may_18,_2005 this court affirmed the district_courts claim_construction and holding of no inequitable_conduct but reversed its holding of validity based on non-obviousness
syntex u.s.a. llc v. apotex inc. 407_f.3d_1371_(fed.cir.2005)` syntex_ii`
specifically we found that the district_court clearly erred in some of its factual findings and misapplied certain legal presumptions with respect to its obviousness analysis
id.at 1378-83
on remand the district_court again held that the ¡¬493_patent was not invalid for obviousness syntex u.s.a. llc v. apotex inc. no._01-2214 2006_wl_1530101_(n.d.cal._june_2,_2006)` syntex_iii` and we affirmed without opinion
221_fed.appx._1002_(fed.cir.2007)

one day after our mandate issued the supreme_court issued its opinion on obviousness in ksr international co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007)
apotex then filed a motion to recall and stay the mandate and to extend the time to request a rehearing in view of ksr but the motion was denied
apotex also filed a petition for writ of certiorari and that petition too was denied
apotex inc. v. syntex u.s.a. llc 552_u.s._887 128_s.ct._209 169_l.ed.2d_146_(2007)

c. on may_24,_2005 roche sued apotex for infringement of the ¡¬493_patent based on the anda-2_formulation
apotex asserted the defenses of non-infringement ; invalidity under 35 u.s.c.¡±¡± 101 103 and 112 ; and unenforceability due to inequitable_conduct
thereafter roche filed a motion for summary_judgment that the anda-2_formulation infringes the ¡¬493_patent and that the validity and unenforceability defenses should be barred based on the earlier syntex_litigation syntex_i syntex_ii and syntex_iii under the doctrines of issue_preclusion and claim_preclusion
apotex countered by arguing that the anda-2_formulation escapes infringement under the reverse_doctrine of equivalents
apotex further averred that the doctrines of issue_preclusion and claim_preclusion were inapplicable because the anda-2_formulation and the anda-1_formulation were distinct and the change in law exception in view of ksr prevented application of those doctrines

on september 11 2007 the district_court granted roches motion for summary_judgment
roche_palo_alto_llc v. apotex inc. 526_f.supp.2d_985 n.d.cal.2007
first the court found that apotex had failed to properly establish the` principle' of the ¡¬493_invention under the first prong of the reverse_doctrine of equivalents analysis
id.at 992-93
although apotex contended that the` principle' of the invention was to use o40 to provide robust_stability to the formulations by forming micelles to prevent interaction between kt and bac the court noted that apotex did not support this` principle' by reference to the claim language specification prosecution_history and/or prior_art which are the proper sources to determine the equitable_scope of the claims
id
therefore the court held that apotex did not meet its burden of establishing a prima_facie_case of noninfringement under the reverse_doctrine of equivalents
id

the district_court also held that apotexs invalidity and unenforceablity arguments with the exception of obviousness were prevented by issue_preclusion because the invalidity of the ¡¬493_patent had already been asserted against roche in the anda-1 litigation
id.at 994-95
following ninth circuit precedent the court held that issue_preclusion barred apotex from challenging validity on any ground even grounds that had not been raised in the first litigation
id.at 995
with respect to the validity challenge on obviousness grounds the court did not reach *1377 whether the supreme_court decision in ksr constituted a change in law necessitating an exception to issue_preclusion because it held that such a challenge was prevented by claim_preclusion
id.at 997

with respect to claim_preclusion the district_court held that the two accused products anda-1 and anda-2 are` essentially the same' and thus each of the invalidity claims in the anda-2 litigation was prevented by claim_preclusion
id.at 997-99
the court further held that there is no` change of law' or fairness_exception to claim_preclusion to prevent its application despite the intervening ksr_decision
id.at 999-1000
hence the court held that apotexs invalidity and unenforceability affirmative defenses were barred by claim_preclusion
id.at 1000

apotex appeals
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

ii
we review a grant of summary_judgment of non-infringement de novo reapplying the standard used by the district_court
innogenetics n.v. v. abbott labs. 512_f.3d_1363 1378 fed.cir.2008
summary judgment is appropriate where drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-movant there is no genuine_issue as to any material_fact and no reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-movant
anderson v. liberty lobby inc. 477_u.s._242 248 255 106_s.ct._2505 91_l.ed.2d_202_(1986)

the determination of infringement is a two-step process wherein the court first construes the claims and then determines whether every claim_limitation or its equivalent is found in the accused device
in re gabapentin patent litig. 503_f.3d_1254 1259 fed.cir.2007
while claim_construction is a question of law that we review de novo cybor corp. v. fas techs. inc. 138_f.3d_1448 1456 fed.cir.1998 en banc non-infringement under the reverse_doctrine of equivalents is a question of fact
sri_int l v. matsushita elec corp. of am. 775_f.2d_1107 1124 fed.cir.1985

we review the district_courts application of the doctrine of claim_preclusion de novo
acumed_llc v. stryker_corp. 525_f.3d_1319 1322-24 fed.cir.2008 ; maldonado v. harris 370_f.3d_945 949 9th cir.2004 ; littlejohn v. united_states 321_f.3d_915 919 9th cir.2003

iii
apotex does not dispute that the anda-2_formulation falls within the literal scope of claim 1 of the ¡¬493_patent
instead apotex argues that the district_court erred in failing to find non-infringement by the anda-2_formulation under the reverse_doctrine of equivalents

the reverse_doctrine of equivalents is an equitable doctrine designed` to prevent unwarranted extension of the claims beyond a fair scope of the patentees invention'
scripps_clinic & research found
v. genentech inc. 927_f.2d_1565 1581 fed.cir.1991
according to the supreme_court [ w ] here a device is so far changed in principle from a patented article that it performs the same or similar function in a substantially different_way but nevertheless falls within the literal words of the claim the [ reverse ] doctrine of equivalents may be used to restrict the claim and defeat the patentees action for infringement
graver tank & mfg co. v. linde air prods co. 339_u.s._605 608-609 70_s.ct._854 94_l.ed._1097_(1950) emphases added
while the patentee bears the burden of proving infringement if the patentee establishes literal_infringement the burden shifts to the accused infringer to set forth a prima_facie_case of non-infringement *1378 under the reverse_doctrine of equivalents
sri_int l 775 f.2d at 1123-24
if the accused infringer is successful in making a prima_facie_case the patentee must then rebut that prima_facie_case
id.at 1124
the reverse_doctrine of equivalents is rarely applied and this court has never affirmed a finding of non-infringement under the reverse_doctrine of equivalents
tate access floors inc. v. interface architectural res. inc. 279_f.3d_1357 1368 fed.cir.2002

apotex relying on the declaration of its scientific expert dr._mitra argues that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would recognize that the` principle' of the ¡¬493_patent is the use of o40 in an amount sufficient to cause the formation of micelles and thereby provide robust_stability to the formulation by preventing interactions between kt and bac
apotex contends that such a principle is supported by the prosecution_history of the ¡¬493_patent application in that the examiner ultimately allowed the claims based on the lidgate_declaration demonstrating the unexpected_results of formulations containing o40
according to apotex it is of no consequence that the claims specification and prosecution_history do not mention` micelles' and that the district_court construed` stabilizing amount' to be an intended result not a claim_limitation since a person of ordinary_skill in the art knows that o40 stabilizes the formulation by forming micelles
in contrast to the patented_invention apotex asserts the concentration of o40 in the anda-2_formulation is far below the concentration required to form micelles
instead in the anda-2_formulation nacl acts to ionically shield kt and bac preventing them from interacting
thus apotex asserts the anda-2_formulation is stabilized by a completely different ingredient and mechanism and functions in a` substantially different_way' from the formulation claimed in the ¡¬493_patent

apotex contends that because it has succeeded in making a prima facie showing of non-infringement under the reserve doctrine of equivalents it is incumbent upon roche to rebut that prima_facie_case
according to apotex roche has presented only attorney arguments not scientific evidence or expert_testimony to rebut apotexs evidence
even if the attorney arguments are accepted as contrary evidence apotex contends that there is at least a genuine_issue of material_fact in dispute not amenable to resolution on summary_judgment
thus apotex asserts the district_court erred by not drawing all inferences in favor of apotex and not finding a genuine_issue of material_fact

we agree with the district_court that apotex has failed to set forth a prima_facie_case of non-infringement under the reverse_doctrine of equivalents because it does not properly establish the principle of the ¡¬493_patent
the` principle' or` equitable_scope of the claims' of the patented_invention is determined in light of the specification prosecution_history and the prior_art
scripps_clinic 927 f.2d at 1581
here however apotex relies exclusively on the declaration of its expert dr._mitra

as the district_court noted there is no mention of` micelle' in the claims specification or prosecution_history of the ¡¬493_patent
further we previously held that there was no error in the district_courts construction of claim 1 of the ¡¬493_patent to regard` stabilizing amount' not as a claim_limitation but as an intended result given that the claim expressly sets forth a concentration_range for o40
syntex_ii 407 f.3d at 1378
thus there is no support in the claims or specification for micelle_formation or for robust stabilization of the formulation by prevention of kt/bac interactions
the prosecution_history is not in evidence in this case and was not relied *1379 on by apotex before the district_court in establishing the principle of the invention
nonetheless there is no indication that the examiner in allowing the claims attributed the unexpected_results of o40 to its superiority in forming micelles
the intrinsic evidence is therefore inconsistent with apotexs proffered` principle' of the ¡¬493_invention

the claims and the specification clearly encompass formulations comprising a broad concentration_range of o40 from 0.001 % to 10 %_wt/vol.big_token__1_example_3__big_token discloses a formulation containing o40 at a concentration of 0.004 %_wt/vol the same concentration as in the anda-2_formulation

for these reasons we agree with the district_court that apotex did not properly support its alleged` principle' of the patented_invention and consequently failed to make out a prima_facie_case of non-infringement under the reverse_doctrine of equivalents
roche therefore was not required to rebut the prima_facie_case
accordingly we find no error by the district_court in rejecting apotexs defense under the reverse_doctrine of equivalents and in granting summary_judgment of literal_infringement of the claims of the ¡¬ 493 patent by the anda-2_formulation

iv
apotex next asserts that the district_court erred in holding that its validity_challenges to the ¡¬493_patent were barred by claim_preclusion
under ninth circuit law claim_preclusion applies where` 1 the same_parties or their privies were involved in the prior_litigation 2 the prior_litigation involved the same_claim or cause of action as the later suit and 3 the prior_litigation was terminated by a final_judgment on the merits'

apotex does not dispute that the syntex_litigation syntex_i syntex_ii and syntex_iii ended in a final_judgment and that it involved the same_parties or their privies
rather apotex contests only the district_courts holding that the instant_litigation pertaining to its anda-2_formulation and the syntex_litigation pertaining to its anda-1_formulation involved the same_claim or cause of action
whether two claims for infringement constitute the` same_claim' is an issue particular to patent law and thus federal_circuit law applies
acumed_llc v. stryker_corp. 525_f.3d_1319 1322-24 fed.cir.2008 ; hallco_mfg co. v. foster 256_f.3d_1290 1294 fed.cir.2001
under the law of the federal_circuit an infringement claim in a second suit is the` same_claim' as in an earlier infringement suit if the accused products in the two suits are` essentially the same'
acumed 525 f.3d at 1324 ; foster v. hallco_mfg co. 947_f.2d_469 479-80 fed.cir.1991
accused products` areessentially the same where the differences between them are merelycolorable orunrelated to the limitations in the claim of the patent
`` acumed 525 f.3d at 1324 citations omitted ; foster 947 f.2d at 480
the party asserting *1380 claim_preclusion has the burden of showing that the accused products are essentially the same
acumed 525 f.3d at 1324 ; foster 947 f.2d at 480

apotex avers that roche had the burden of establishing that the anda-2_formulation at issue in the instant_litigation and the anda-1_formulation at issue in the syntex_litigation were` essentially the same' yet roche did not present any expert_testimony or other evidence to that effect
in contrast apotex provided the mitra declaration which shows that the concentration of o40 in the anda-2_formulation is insufficient to form micelles and thus the anda-2_formulation is materially different from the anda-1_formulation
apotex further contends that the anda-2_formulation is not` essentially the same' as the anda-1_formulation because the two formulations are stabilized by completely different ingredients and mechanisms
whereas micelle_formation by o40 stabilizes the anda-1_formulation ionic shielding by nacl stabilizes the anda-2_formulation
according to apotex the fact that it had to file a separate anda for the anda-2_formulation is additional evidence that the anda-2_formulation is materially different from the anda-1_formulation
thus apotex asserts that there is at least a genuine_issue of material_fact as to whether the two anda formulations are` essentially the same'

we find no error in the district_courts analysis
the court determined that the anda-1_formulation and the anda-2_formulation are` essentially the same' because any differences between them are unrelated to the claims of the ¡¬ 493 patent
though the court recognized that there are differences in the concentrations of the ingredients in the anda-1 and anda-2_formulations it also realized that all of the concentrations are well within the ranges claimed in the ¡¬493_patent
the fact that they are stabilized by different mechanisms even if true is irrelevant because both formulations are encompassed by the claims of the ¡¬493_patent
thus any difference in composition between the two formulations is merely colorable and the two formulations are` essentially the same'

in the alternative apotex asserts that principles of fairness should prevent application of claim_preclusion given the change in the law of obviousness following the supreme_courts opinion in ksr
in essence apotex argues that claim_preclusion is not absolute and that this is a case where an exception to the finality rule should apply

the district_court however correctly recognized that there is no` change of law' or fairness_exception to prevent application of claim_preclusion
federated_dep't_stores inc. v. moitie 452_u.s._394 398 101_s.ct._2424 69_l.ed.2d_103_(1981) ; see also clifton v. att y gen. of cal. 997_f.2d_660 663 9th cir.1993` for us to conclude under the facts of this case that the district_courts order has become aninstrument of wrong merely because it rests on a since repudiated rationale would be to nullify the doctrine of res_judicata
`` ; wilson v. lynaugh 878_f.2d_846 850-51 5th cir.1989 ; precision_air_parts inc. v. avco corp. 736_f.2d_1499 1503 11th cir.1984` the general rule.. throughout the nation is that changes in the law after a final_judgment do not prevent the application of res_judicata and collateral estoppel even though the grounds on which the decision was based are subsequently overruled
`` ; hardison v. alexander 655_f.2d_1281 1288-89 d.c.cir.1981
although there may be a rare exception in cases involving` momentus changes in important fundamental constitutional rights' *1381 precision_air_parts 736 f.2d at 1504 no such right is involved here

as the supreme_court explained nor are the res_judicata consequences of a final unappealed judgment on the merits altered by the fact that the judgment may have been wrong or rested on a legal principle subsequently overruled in another case.. we have observed that` [ t ] he indulgence of a contrary view would result in creating elements of uncertainty and confusion and in undermining the conclusive character of judgments consequences which it was the very purpose of the doctrine of res_judicata to avert'
federated_dep't_stores 452 u.s. at 398-99 101_s.ct._2424 citations and internal quotations omitted
thus the ksr_decision does not prevent application of claim_preclusion

accordingly the district_court did not err in concluding that apotexs validity_challenges to the ¡¬493_patent were barred by the doctrine of claim_preclusion.2

v. for the foregoing reasons we affirm the district_courts grant of roches motion for summary_judgment that the anda-2_formulation literally infringes the claims of the ¡¬493_patent and that apotexs invalidity and unenforceability challenges to the ¡¬493_patent are barred by claim_preclusion

apotex asserts that if the ¡¬493 claims are construed to cover the entire claimed o40 concentration_range then the claims are invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 first paragraph because they are not enabled throughout their full scope
alternatively apotex argues that if the claims are so construed they are invalid as obvious under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 because not all concentrations form micelles and thus produce unexpected_results
such arguments go to the validity of the claims of the ¡¬493_patent
for the reasons discussed below we agree with the district_court that such validity_challenges are barred by claim_preclusion
2
because we hold that the district_court properly determined that apotexs validity_challenges were barred by claim_preclusion we need not reach whether the district_court lawfully applied the doctrine of issue_preclusion to bar the same validity_challenges
