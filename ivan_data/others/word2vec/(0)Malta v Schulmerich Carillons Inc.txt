rich circuit_judge
jacob_h._malta and malmark inc. malmark collectively malta appeal in this patent case from the november 20 1989 order of the united_states_district_court for the eastern_district of pennsylvania granting judgment notwithstanding a jury_verdict jnov of non-infringement in favor of defendant schulmerich_carillons inc. schulmerich
malta v. schulmerich_carillons inc. 13_uspq2d_1900_(e.d.pa.1989)
schulmerich_cross-appealed from the november 20 order insofar as it denied schulmerichs motion for jnov that it is the equitable_owner of the patent in suit and/or has a shop right under that patent
we affirm on the ground of non-infringement and do not reach the cross-appeal

background
a
the patent in suit
the patent in suit u.s. patent no._3941,082082_patent issued to mr. jacob_malta is directed to improvements in the design of handbells of the type used by music groups in churches schools and the like
quoting the patent` [ a ] chorus of players using a plurality of tuned bells may render any given tune which falls within the range of notes offered by the specific bells'

handbells are generally made up of the bell itself a handle attached to the closed_end of the bell and a clapper_assembly pivotably mounted inside the bell and moving in a single plane
attached to one end of the clapper_assembly is a generally circular clapper or striker which when the handbell is swung strikes the bell to ring it

the082_patent discloses a number of improvements in handbell design
most relevant to this suit is maltas provision of a clapper mechanism for allowing the loudness of the bell to be quickly adjusted` on the fly' i.e. while the bell is being played
specifically it was known in the prior_art *1322 to provide the peripheral surface of the clapper with portions of differing hardness so that by rotating the clapper one could change which portion of it struck the bell and consequently the loudness of the bell
however the clapper could not be adjusted while the bell was being played
the082_patent not only provided the clapper with striking_surfaces of differing hardness around the periphery thereof but also provided a detent mechanism which releasably locked the clapper in each desired position
in that way the clapper could be rotated by hand while the handbell was being played

the082_patent discloses two different embodiments for the clapper
these two embodiments shown in figs
3_and_7 of the082_patent are reproduced below

?
?
-- -- - the first embodiment shown in fig._3 has three opposing pairs of` striking_surfaces'
the first pair 66 consists simply of the hard rubber of which the clapper is made
the second pair 68 of striking_surfaces has a slot cut into the rubber material
the third pair 70 has a piece of soft_material such as felt attached to the clapper
these three pairs of striking_surfaces provide a loud medium and soft sound respectively

the second embodiment shown in fig._7 has three` opposed pairs of buttons' 82 attached to the surface of the clapper
each pair of buttons has a different_degree of hardness so that like the embodiment of fig._3 either a soft medium or loud sound can be produced depending on which button pair is aligned to strike the bell
( the patents term` opposed pairs' is somewhat confusing
the pairs are not opposed ; rather each pair has opposed buttons of the same_hardness

claims 2_and_3 are relevant to this appeal
claim 3 reads as follows 3
a handbell_comprising in combination a bell having a generally closed_end ; a clapper_assembly adapted to be removably carried within said bell and centrally of the closed_end thereof said assembly comprising a clapper_shaft having one end pivotally associated centrally of the closed_end of said bell and carrying a clapper_member at its free_extremity said clapper_member comprising a generally circular_striker_assembly rotatably positioned substantially normal to said clapper_shaft and including a plurality of striking_buttons positioned in opposed pairs around the outer_periphery thereof and wherein each pair of buttons has a different_degree of hardness ; means on said clapper_assembly coacting with said rotatable_striker_assembly for permitting rotation of said striker_assembly relative to said clapper_shaft for selectively positioning desired pairs of buttons in striking relation to said bell ; and detent means cooperating with said rotatable_striker for releasably holding said striker_assembly in any preselected position
[ emphasis ours ]
claim 2 is very similar to claim 3 and differs primarily in two respects one instead *1323 of the` coacting' means recited in claim 3 claim 2 requires an` indexing means' on the handle and the clapper_assembly ; and two instead of the` buttons' recited in claim 3 claim 2 requires` at least three opposed pairs of surface_portions wherein each of said pairs has a different_degree of hardness'

b
the proceedings in the district court
this case presents the familiar scenario of an employee who leaves his job and starts his own company only to find himself later at legal odds with his former employer
jacob_malta was employed by schulmerich as its chief engineer from 1956_to_1973
in 1973 mr._malta left schulmerich and in 1975 formed malmark
malmark quickly grew and became the primary competitor of schulmerich in the handbell business
the two companies currently supply about 95 % of the handbell market

in 1985 malta sued schulmerich and other defendants alleging among other_things that a line of schulmerich_handbells sold under the trademark` quick-adjust' infringes claims 2_and_3 of the082_patent1 the quick-adjust_handbells are on-the-fly adjustable handbells which have striking_surfaces similar to fig._3 of the082_patent with pairs of opposed_striking_surfaces of different_hardness by virtue of felt coverings and/or slots or holes formed in the hard rubber clapper

with respect to claim 3 schulmerich denied infringement primarily on the ground that its quick-adjust_handbells do not have a striker_assembly with` a plurality of striking_buttons positioned in opposed pairs around the outer_periphery thereof and wherein each pair of buttons has a different_degree of hardness'
schulmerich argued that the082_patent uses the word` buttons' only in conjunction with the embodiment of fig._7 and that the quick-adjust_handbells do not have such buttons
in response malta argued and presented evidence to show that the word` buttons' was not limited to the embodiment of fig._7 but should be construed broadly to literally include striking_surfaces such as those of fig._3 of the082_patent and those of the quick-adjust_handbells

in addition to denying liability on the ground of non-infringement schulmerich also contended that jacob_malta had actually invented the subject_matter of the082_patent while employed at schulmerich
consequently schulmerich argued that it was either the equitable_owner of the082_patent due to mr._maltas contractual obligation to assign to schulmerich all inventions made while working for schulmerich or at the very least had a shop right in the patented subject_matter

the case was tried before a jury
malta requested and obtained a jury_instruction not only on literal_infringement but also on the doctrine of equivalents
in particular the judge instructed the jury that
infringement under the doctrine of equivalents may exist if the accused handbells perform substantially the same_function in substantially the same_way so as to obtain substantially the same_results as the claimed invention

* * * * * * in applying the doctrine of equivalents remember that infringement requires that each and every element of an asserted claim or the equivalent of the element must be present in the accused device

the jury was given special_interrogatories asking whether the quick-adjust_handbells infringed claims 2_and_3 of the082_patent either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents
in response the jury found for reasons unrelated to any issue here that claim 2 was not infringed but that claim 3 while not literally infringed was infringed under the doctrine of equivalents
the jury was also given special_interrogatories concerning schulmerichs claim of either equitable_ownership or shop right and found that schulmerich had neither
the jury awarded damages in the amount of $ 950,000

*1324 schulmerich moved for jnov on the grounds that the evidence was not sufficient to support either the finding of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents or the finding that schulmerich had neither equitable_ownership of nor a shop right in the082_patent

approximately seven months later while decision on the jnov_motion was still pending this court decided the case of lear_siegler inc. v. sealy_mattress_co. 873_f.2d_1422 10_uspq2d_1767_(fed.cir.1989)
in lear_siegler this court reversed a jurys finding of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents stating among other_things absent the proper graver_tank2 context i.e. a showing of how plaintiff compares the function means and result of its claimed invention with those of the accused device a jury is more or less put to sea without guiding charts when called upon to determine infringement under the doctrine
while we do not doubt the ability of a jury to decide the factual_issue of equivalence to enable the jury to use its ability nestier3 requires that the three graver_tank_elements [ substantial_identity of function way and result ] must be presented in the form of particularized_testimony and linking_argument

873 f.2d at 1425-26 10 uspq2d at 1770
schulmerich brought lear_siegler to the judges attention in a letter citing the case in support of its motion for jnov of noninfringement

the judge upheld the jurys verdict as to the equitable_ownership/shop right question but agreed that the evidence was insufficient to support the finding of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
the judge relying heavily on the lear_siegler decision found that malta had not provided` particularized_testimony and linking_argument' as to each of the function/way/result prongs of the tripartite graver_tank_equivalency_test and granted jnov in favor of schulmerich
he set aside the jury_verdict and refused to enter a permanent injunction against schulmerich

malta appeals from the grant of jnov of non-infringement and schulmerich_cross-appeals from the denial of its jnov_motion based on the equitable_ownership/shop right defense

opinion
a. sufficiency of the motion for directed verdict
before reaching the merits of the infringement question we address a procedural issue raised by malta
malta argues that schulmerichs motion for a directed_verdict was insufficient to support the jnov_motion that was later granted by the district_court

rule 50 a of the federal_rules of civil_procedure states that a` motion for directed_verdict shall state the specific grounds therefor'
fed.r.civ.p
50 b allows for entry of jnov only` in accordance with the partys motion for a directed_verdict'
orthokinetics inc. v. safety travel chairs inc. 806_f.2d_1565 1579 1_uspq2d_1081 1091 fed.cir.1986 ground on which jnov_motion is based must have been asserted in a motion for directed_verdict
issue of willfulness of infringement is not the same thing as issue of infringement

the record shows that at the close of maltas case at the trial in the district_court schulmerichs counsel moved orally for directed_verdict as follows [ v ] ery briefly we move for a directed_verdict on the issue of noninfringement of claims 2 and claims 3 of the 082 patent on the grounds that the evidence is insufficient
after the close of all the evidence counsel stated that this motion was renewed

malta argues that such general allegations of insufficiency of the evidence are *1325 insufficient to support a jnov_motion that was granted because of a lack of particularized function/way/result testimony and linking_argument
we disagree
as is clear from the infringement discussion in section b infra the district_court correctly granted schulmerichs motion for jnov because malta failed to present sufficient_evidence to the individual function/way/result elements of the graver_tank_equivalency_test
that is to say the evidence of infringement of claim 3 was insufficient which was the basis of the motion for directed_verdict

the trial_judges initial order filed nov._21,_1989 began by stating` because the evidence does not prove the essential elements of plaintiffs case the [ defendants ] motion for judgment_n.o.v
must be granted'
the next day the judge signed another order supplementing the first order saying it` is reopened and judgment is hereby entered for defendant as if the verdict requested at the close of the evidence had been directed
fed.r.civ.p
50 b'

clearly the trial_judge had no doubt nor do we that the ground stated in support of the first motion for directed_verdict and in support of the motion for jnov were one and the same
the latter therefore was supported as required by fed.r.civ.p
50 a and b
maltas argument to the contrary is without merit

b
infringement and the doctrine of equivalents
to convince this court that a trial_judge erred in granting a motion for jnov an appellant must show that there was substantial_evidence to support the jurys factual findings and that those findings can support the jurys legal_conclusion
orthokinetics 806 f.2d at 1571 1 uspq2d at 1085

in order to prove infringement under the doctrine of equivalents a patentee must show that the accused device performs substantially the same_function in substantially the same_way to achieve substantially the same result as the claimed device
graver_tank 339 u.s. at 608 70 s.ct.at 856 85 uspq at 330
the` substantially the same_way' prong of this test may be met if an equivalent of a recited limitation has been substituted in the accused device
see corning_glass works v. sumitomo elec
u.s.a. inc. 868_f.2d_1251 1259 9_uspq2d_1962 1967 fed.cir.1989
the issues of infringement and of equivalency are issues of fact
sun studs inc. v. ata equip
leasing inc. 872_f.2d_978 986 10_uspq2d_1338 1345 fed.cir.1989

as an initial matter malta contends that the trial_judge erred in his grant of jnov when he stated that a patentee
must substantiate all three aspects of equivalency per graver_tank as to each limitation of a claim in order to establish equivalence between claim and accused device
this court has never adopted the three prong_approach to determining equivalency of a limitation
in pennwalt corp. v. durand-wayland inc. 833_f.2d_931 4_uspq2d_1737_(fed.cir.1987) in banc cert
denied 485_u.s._961 108_s.ct._1226 99_l.ed.2d_426_(1988) this court upheld a finding of no infringement involving the doctrine of equivalents because the patentee did not establish the presence in the accused device of every claim_element4` or its substantial_equivalent'
pennwalt 833 f.2d at 935-36 4 uspq2d at 1740-41 claimed function found missing
pennwalt did not set forth a test as to how one proves that an element in an accused device is the` substantial_equivalent' of a claim_limitation directed to a single element in dispute-here the` buttons'

in the subsequent corning_glass case 868 f.2d at 1260 9 uspq2d at 1968-69 we stated
this court has not set out in its precedent a definitive formula for determining equivalency between a required limitation or combination of limitations and what has been allegedly substituted therefor in the accused device
nor do *1326 we propose to adopt one here
we note that the district_court resolved the question by comparison of the function/way/result of the substitution with the function/way/result of the limitation in the context of the invention ; that is the court made a subsidiary analysis comparable to the overall_function/way/result analysis mandated for determining infringement under the doctrine of equivalents

* * * * * * the district_courts` function/way/result' equivalency analysis with respect to a claim_limitation appears to be a helpful way to approach the problem and entirely in accord with the analysis actually made in graver_tank..
thus while comparison of function/way/result is an acceptable way of showing that structure in an accused device is the` substantial_equivalent' of a claim_limitation it is not the only way to do so and to this extent the trial_judge in the present_case did err
however this error is harmless

how equivalency to a required limitation is met necessarily varies from case to case due to many variables such as the form of the claim the nature of the invention defined by it the kind of limitation that is not literally met etc
for example the fact situations in corning_glass and in this case are simply not comparable yet application of the doctrine must be adapted to each which is why the corning panel declined to propose a formula of general_applicability for determining equivalency to a claim_limitation
see hughes aircraft co. v. united_states 717_f.2d_1351 1361 219_uspq_473 480 fed.cir.1983` the doctrine is judicially devised to do equity'

maltas proofs lack evidence to prove either that all three prongs of the graver_tank test are met or that the` buttons' limitation was met equivalently
the evidence malta principally points to is the following two portions of the testimony of jacob_malta emphasis ours q would you make that clear as to what the structure is in the schulmerich_bell that corresponds to the buttons that are recited in the claim ?
a all right
the structure is these portions of the clapper in this case the opposed felt pieces and adjacent thereto on each side these elliptical_spots of green indicating that there are additional_pairs of opposed_striking_surfaces
q striking surfaces
would you go on with your explanation of how the portion illustrated in color in the exhibit_corresponds to the claim_language ?
a right
the-as i described we have a plurality of buttons theres three sets buttons or the equivalent thereof and they are in opposed pairs around the periphery
weve described how they are related to these indexing_slots in the underside of the brass_clapper_insert and each pair has a different_degree of hardness weve described that
here again we have felt which produces a soft_impact_sound
here this would be in relation to this slotted_portion here where we have a slot in the core and at 180 degrees another slot that would be the medium_impact_position
and then the lowermost_one would be the-this one opposed to this where we have a solid_plastic_material in the impact_plane producing a brilliant_sound
and q and claim 3 includes as a part of the striker_assembly the phrase` a plurality of striking_buttons positioned in opposed pairs around the outer_periphery thereof wherein each pair of buttons is a different_degree of hardness' correct ?
a thats right
q do you find those buttons in [ the accused ] structure ?
a yes there are buttons per se here the felt the opposed felt certainly are visible buttons
the opposed locations or surfaces which are related to these long slots are likewise buttons and the opposed pair of solid portions again are buttons
q do you mean theyre buttons or function like buttons ?
a they function like buttons..

*1327 this court in lear_siegler following nestier held that a patentee must prove substantial_identity as to each of the function way and result prongs of the doctrine of equivalents
lear_siegler 873 f.2d at 1425 10 uspq2d at 1770 nestier 739 f.2d at 1579-80 222 uspq at 750
as the court noted in lear_siegler such proof is necessary to prevent the jury from being` put to sea without guiding charts' and from determining infringement by simply comparing the claimed invention and the accused device` as to overall similarity'
lear_siegler 873 f.2d at 1426-27 10 uspq2d at 1770-71.5

with this requirement in mind we agree with the district_court that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
maltas brief to this court discusses the above testimony at great_length explaining how this testimony informs the jury of the function way and result achieved by the accused device
however what is clearly lacking in that testimony is a sufficient explanation of both why the overall_function way and result of the accused device are substantially the same as those of the claimed device and why the plastic/slotted_plastic/felt arrangement is the equivalent of the claimed buttons_limitation
mr._maltas offhand and conclusory statements` buttons or the equivalent thereof' and` they function like buttons' are not sufficiently particularized evidence
in short with little guidance the jury was left to its own_imagination on the technical issue of equivalency

there is no other evidence in the case which provides the necessary` substantial_evidence' on the issue of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
the082_patent itself has the following to say about the two embodiments of figs
3_and_7 col. 4 11
46-48 another form of clapper is depicted in fig._7
it has all of the advantages of the one shown in fig._3 but varies in design flexibility and simplicity
thus while the two embodiments are described as being alternatives to each other they are not equivalent in` way'
further the patent specifically uses the term` striking_surfaces' with respect to the embodiment of fig._3 but uses the different term` buttons' with respect to fig._7
the claims of the patent maintain this distinction ; claim 2 describes the surface of the clapper using the broad_term` surface_portions' while claim 3 uses the narrower_term` buttons'
though application of the doctrine of equivalents extends the protection of the patent beyond the literal words of the claims it is not proper` to erase a plethora of meaningful structural and functional limitations of the claim on which the public is entitled to rely in avoiding infringement'
perkin-elmer_corp. v. westinghouse elec corp. 822_f.2d_1528 1532 3_uspq2d_1321 1324 fed.cir.1987
in the present_case where malta employs a broad_term in one claim but a narrower_term used with respect to only one embodiment in the specification in another claim the implication is that infringement of the second claim can be avoided by not meeting the narrower_term

in sum we agree with the district_court that malta failed to present evidence sufficient to support a finding of infringement of claim 3 under the doctrine of equivalents and we therefore uphold the courts grant of jnov

c.` retroactive application of lear_siegler' malta argues that it is improper to retroactively apply the holding of lear_siegler *1328 to this case citing chevron_oil_co. v. huson 404_u.s._97 92_s.ct._349 30_l.ed.2d_296_(1971) since lear_siegler allegedly established a new_principle of law
however as noted in the previous two sections lear_siegler merely requires that a patentee prove all elements of his case which with respect to the doctrine of equivalents means that a patentee must prove that each prong of the graver_tank_equivalency_test is met
while lear_siegler set forth this requirement in language particularly suitable to the present jury case we do not agree that lear_siegler established any new_principle of law
reading the opinion is enough to show that the district_court was right in saying n. 7` lear_siegler merely repeats in so many words the explication of nestier'
nestier was decided in 1984
this case was not tried until 1988
there has been no retroactive_application of law

d. schulmerichs cross-appeal
having upheld the district_courts determination of non-infringement we need not and do not reach the issues of equitable_ownership and shop right raised in schulmerichs cross-appeal
schulmerichs brief states if this court affirms the trial_court in relation to the grant of jnov due to the failure of proof at trial by malta/malmark it need not consider schulmerichs cross-appeal on the issue of co-ownership

e. the dissent
with all respect to the dissent we are not rejecting a jury_verdict or making a de novo_determination of infringement
we are reviewing the district_courts judgment notwithstanding the jury_verdict the district_court which tried the case heard all the evidence including mr._maltas self-serving testimony and opinions about claim construction together with his elaborate illustrations so laboriously listed in the dissent
what we are affirming is the judgment of the fully informed district judge based on his holding that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents a doctrine the application of which enlarges the coverage of the patent beyond what is defined in the claims
we are following the instruction of the supreme_court in graver_tank 339 u.s. at 610 70 s.ct.at 857 referring to the application of the doctrine that it is to be decided by the trial_court and that courts decision under general principles of appellate_review should not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous
in essence what we are affirming is the district_courts decision that in view of all the evidence this is not a case in which the doctrine of equivalents can be applied that being the only basis on which malta can contend that his patent is infringed
the district_courts detailed opinion of november 21 1989 discussed the doctrine of equivalents and its proper application at great_length and came to the correct conclusion that` plaintiffs offered no more than brief conclusory evidence that the schulmerich_bell contains the equivalent of the disputed buttons'
that is what we are reviewing not the jury_verdict and we will not disturb it
for this courts most recent views on application of the doctrine of equivalents see london v. carson pirie scott & co. 946_f.2d_1534 20_uspq2d_1456_(fed.cir.1991)

conclusion
for all of the above reasons the judgment of the district_court is affirmed

affirmed

michel circuit_judge concurring
i agree that the district_courts grant of jnov to defendants must be affirmed and i join in judge_richs opinion
i enter this concurrence only to emphasize that our ground of decision is required implicitly by graver_tank and mfg co. v. linde air prods co. 339_u.s._605 70_s.ct._854 94_l.ed._1097 85_uspq_828_(1950) and explicitly by lear_siegler inc. v. sealy_mattress_co. 873_f.2d_1422 10_uspq2d_1767_(fed.cir.1989)
for me what is fatal in this record is the failure of mr._malta to separate and explicate his comparative analysis *1329 of` way' from his comparison of` function' and` result' and to substantiate it
all three requirements of graver_tank were discussed together with only two fleeting conclusory and inferential references to way
consequently there was insubstantial_evidence of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents as to way and therefore the verdict of infringement under the doctrine can not be sustained

i
the law
in lear_siegler 873 f.2d at 1425-26 10 uspq2d at 1770 this court clarified a specific requirement that must be met before the question of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents may be submitted to the trier of fact for decision
to survive a motion for a directed_verdict or a jnov a patentee must present` substantial_evidence' comparing the claimed and accused inventions to one another as to each of the three aspects of equivalency set forth in graver_tank 339 u.s. at 608 70 s.ct.at 856 85 uspq at 330-' function'` way' and` result'
lear_siegler 873 f.2d at 1425-26 10 uspq2d at 1770
in lear_siegler we said
[ t ] he party asserting infringement must present` evidence and argument concerning the doctrine and each of its elements'
...
while we do not doubt the ability of a jury to decide the factual_issue of equivalence to enable the jury to use its ability nestier requires that the three graver_tank_elements must be presented in the form of particularized_testimony and linking_argument
873 f.2d at 1425-26 10 uspq2d at 1770 citing nestier_corp. v. menasha_corp.-lewisystems_div. 739_f.2d_1576 1579 222_uspq_747 749 fed.cir.1984 5-judge panel cert
denied 470_u.s._1053 105_s.ct._1756 84_l.ed.2d_819_(1985) emphasis in original
thus under nestier_corp. and lear_siegler substantial_evidence of comparison as to function way and result is required as part of the patentees prima_facie_case of infringement under the doctrine
therefore if the comparison evidence is not substantial the issue may not be submitted to the jury
or if the trial_court erred and the jury was allowed to decide the issue and returned a verdict for patentee jnov must be granted

we have also held that the comparison as to each graver_tank element must be made` explicitly' and` separately'
lear_siegler 873 f.2d at 1425-26 10 uspq2d at 1770
consequently a jury_verdict of infringement under the doctrine can only survive a motion for jnov if substantial_evidence was presented that explicitly and separately compares the function/way/result of the accused device with the function/way/result of the claimed invention to show that they are substantially the same
that was not done here as to way

compliance with lear_siegler is a question of law which we review de novo
on a motion for directed_verdict or jnov the trial_judge must decide such an issue of law by assessing whether evidence of comparison that is substantial separate and explicit was introduced by the patentee as to each aspect of infringement by equivalents
see senmed inc. v. richard-allan medical indus. 888_f.2d_815 818 12_uspq2d_1508 1511 fed.cir.1989

ii
the law applied to this case
the trial_judge conducted such an assessment here
in reviewing this legal_issue de novo we decide he was correct in concluding the evidence was not substantial

as the dissent details in the instant case extensive evidence was presented about how the striking_surfaces of the accused bell work
the jury was not separately and explicitly told however that drilling slots behind striking_surfaces on a clapper made of the same_plastic_material is an equivalent` way' compared to attaching striking_buttons made from different_materials
to be sure the jury was told and shown that the` function' and` result' of their clappers striking the bells were the same and indeed these two aspects of equivalency are all but uncontested
and while explaining the similarity of function and result mr._malta may have briefly implied that the way was also essentially the same the jury certainly was not told *1330 how and why that was so
in other words plaintiffs separate and explicit_comparison_evidence was sufficient to establish only two of the three graver_tank_requirements
the testimony as to` way' was not substantial
nor was it separate and explicit
rather it was brief intermingled inferential and conclusory
because lear_siegler clearly requires separate explicit and substantial_comparison_evidence as to all three requirements the case should not have been submitted to the jury and thus the jury_verdict can not stand

iii
the dissent
the dissent suggests that the majority has added` a new_requirement of proof of equivalency proof of not only the three graver_tankprongs offunction way and result but also a fourth_prong ofwhy'
such a characterization of the majoritys holding is inaccurate
because often substantial proof of equivalence of` way' can be made only by an explanation of` how and why' the apparently separate requirement of proof of` why' is actually only an elaboration on the requirement of equivalence as to` way'

to my mind it is clearly no answer to point as does the dissent to the great quantity of evidence on the general operation of each of the two bells at issue in this case i.e. the commercial embodiment of the claimed bell and the accused bell
no amount of purely descriptive_evidence about either can suffice absent separate explicit and substantial_comparison_evidence that the clapper` striking_surfaces' work in the same` way' as the` buttons'

that the instructions did not contain erroneous statements of law were reasonably comprehensive and went unchallenged is immaterial
defendants did move for a directed_verdict both at the end of plaintiffs case and again at the close of all the evidence
the stated ground was insufficiency of the evidence on infringement
no reason has been advanced why they should also be required to make the vain gesture of objecting to a facially proper charge of infringement by equivalents
in any event fed.r.civ.p
50 b explicitly states that whenever a motion for directed_verdict is denied` the court is deemed to have submitted the action to the jury subject to a later determination of the legal questions raised by the motion'
as was noted earlier compliance with lear_siegler is a legal question

moreover lear_siegler is based on the very premise that sufficiency of instructions can not cure an insufficiency of proof as to the three graver_tank_requirements
the reason we do not allow curing by instructions is that even with perfect jury_instructions determining infringement by equivalents would still be guesswork for a jury unless it is given separate explicit and substantial_evidence of comparison as to each requirement of graver_tank
after all such comparisons are what infringement by equivalents is all about
as the district_court noted the danger that lear_siegler building directly on nestier_corp. is designed to prevent is that of the doctrine of equivalents becoming` a result oriented catch-all'
malta v. schulmerich_carillons inc. 13_uspq2d_1900 1903 e.d.pa.1989

the simplicity of the bells so emphasized by the dissent is not relevant either
in lear_siegler the devices at issue-mattress springs-were equally simple and in no manner implicated complex_technology
however the rule of lear_siegler is a prophylactic rule of general_applicability
as such it must cover the whole range of infringement cases many of which do indeed involve complex_technology
i would agree though that the more complex the technology the greater the need for the rule
but that is not to say there can be any case where this rule does not apply
in requiring sufficient_evidence on each aspect of equivalence lear_siegler merely makes explicit what graver_tank implied

nor is it relevant that as the dissent notes slots in the clapper material were well known in the prior_art for the obviousness of the` way' can not explicate for judge or jury that it is equivalent i.e. substantially the same much less how and why
that clapper_surfaces with slots were known as an alternative to buttons *1331 of differing materials does not necessarily make them an equivalent
in fact obviousness is simply non-probative of the three-part test of equivalence

contrary to the dissent the rule of lear_siegler does not implicate the jurys prerogatives under the constitution the case law the federal_rules of civil_procedure or otherwise
it simply addresses whether the evidence is sufficient to permit submission of the issue to the jury at all
it is thus a rule that restricts judges not jurors

the dissent also suggests that schulmerichs failure to request jury_instructions on the rule of lear_siegler means schulmerich waived the protections of the rule
as a rule that restricts judges and not jurors its purpose is to establish when the issue of infringement by equivalents may be given to the jury
it is thus not subject to waiver because of suggested jury_instructions or the lack thereof

finally contrary to the suggestion of the dissent in my view there is not a genuine issue of retroactive_application of new law
while judge_richs opinion relies primarily on statements in nestier_corp. decided before the trial of this case as first setting forth the requirement restated in lear_siegler decided after this trial to overcome the dissents argument on retroactivity there is a simpler answer
i submit that requiring separate explicit and substantial_comparison_evidence of each of the three graver_tank aspects of equivalency has been the law at least since 1950 when graver_tank itself was decided
if lear_siegler added gloss thereto it was on peripheral points not dispositive here such as the requirement of` testimony' as opposed to other forms of evidence and` linking_argument' which being only attorney assertions is of course not evidence at all

iv
conclusion
generally speaking both the purpose and effect of the rule of lear_siegler are to minimize the risk that a jury will find infringement under the doctrine of equivalents merely because one or two of the three graver_tank_requirements is met ignoring the other s or blindly assuming the other s must be met too
thus lear_siegler requires that before a case may be submitted to a jury a patentees proof must include substantial_evidence of separate and explicit comparison of the claimed and accused devices as to each of the three graver_tank_requirements
a case based solely on descriptive_evidence no matter how extensive may not go to the jury
nor may a case lacking separate explicit and substantial_evidence on each of the graver_tank_requirements of equivalence

here no separate and explicit_comparison_evidence at all was presented as to whether how and why the clapper_surfaces of the same_plastic_material with slots drilled behind them operated in the same` way' as the striking_buttons made of materials of different_hardness
instead brief inferential and conclusory references to way were buried in answers dealing primarily with function and result
that is not substantial_evidence and the jury certainly would not appreciate it as evidence of way
thus an error of law occurred in submitting the case to the jury

i join judge_richs opinion affirming the district_courts judgment of no infringement despite the verdict
i set forth these concurring views in order to clarify lear_siegler

pauline newman circuit_judge dissenting
i respectfully dissent for neither the law nor the record provides a basis for overturning the jurys verdict
upon full trial upon agreed and correct jury_instructions upon substantial_evidence in the form of testimony and exhibits and demonstrations a reasonable_jury could have reached the verdict of infringement reached by this jury
that ends our review
with all respect to my colleagues on this panel their rejection of the jury_verdict and de novo_determination of the factual_issue of infringement is contrary to the law governing appellate_review of jury_verdicts

the questions of infringement and equivalency were decided by the jury
see gunning *1332 v. cooley 281_u.s._90 94 50_s.ct._231 233 74_l.ed._720_(1930)` issues that depend on the.. weight of evidence are to be decided by the jury
`` ; baltimore & ohio_r._co. v. groeger 266_u.s._521 524 45_s.ct._169 170 69_l.ed._419_(1925)` the weight and probative value of evidence are to be determined by the jury and not by the judge'
a reasonable_jury correctly instructed viewing all the evidence presented at trial of the case here under review could have found infringement by equivalency
our role is appellate_review not trial de novo
see gallick v. baltimore & ohio_r._co. 372_u.s._108 112-14 83_s.ct._659 662-63 9_l.ed.2d_618_(1963) the appellate_court improperly invaded the jurys function and province in its holding that the evidence at trial of a causal connection fell short of that required for the consideration of a jury

as the court stated in anderson v. city of bessemer city 470_u.s._564 574-75 105_s.ct._1504 1511-12 84_l.ed.2d_518_(1985) the trial on the merits is` themain event.. rather than atryout on the road` quoting wainwright v. sykes 433_u.s._72 90 97_s.ct._2497 2508 53_l.ed.2d_594_(1977)
when the relationship between trial and appellate tribunals is distorted the consequences disserve the public and the courts the principal consequences of broadening appellate_review are two
such a course impairs the confidence of litigants and the public in the decisions of the trial_courts and it multiplies the number of appeals

a. appellate review
the standard of judicial_review of jury_verdicts is established
sometimes described as a` reasonable_jury' standard and sometimes as a` substantial_evidence' standard the challenger must show that there was not an evidentiary_basis for the verdict
as discussed by the court but where as here there is an evidentiary_basis for the jurys verdict the jury is free to discard or disbelieve whatever facts are inconsistent with its conclusion
and the appellate_courts function is exhausted when that evidentiary_basis becomes apparent it being immaterial that the court might draw a contrary inference or feel that another conclusion is more reasonable
lavender v. kurn 327_u.s._645 653 66_s.ct._740 744 90_l.ed._916_(1946)
this standard has its roots in the constitution and in tradition for the principles underlying the jury right require that the jury_verdict receive judicial deference

many illustrations of the requisite standard of appellate_review of jury_verdicts appear in the precedent of the third circuit.1 e.g. chuy v. philadelphia eagles football club 595_f.2d_1265 1273 3d cir.1979 en banc` our limited function at this point is to ascertain from review of the record whether there is sufficient_evidence to sustain the verdict of the jury on this issue' ; dawson v. chrysler corp. 630_f.2d_950 959 3d cir.1980 cert
denied 450_u.s._959 101_s.ct._1418 67_l.ed.2d_383_(1981) the jury_verdict must be sustained unless the record` is critically deficient of that minimum_quantum of evidence from which a jury might reasonably *1333 afford relief' quoting denneny v. siegel 407_f.2d_433 439 3d cir.1969

federal_circuit decisions have well illustrated this standard
e.g. orthokinetics inc. v. safety travel chairs inc. 806_f.2d_1565 1571 1_uspq2d_1081 1085 fed.cir.1986 to convince this court that a trial_judge erred in granting a motion for jnov an appellant need only show that there was substantial_evidence to support the jurys findings and that those findings can support the jurys legal_conclusion
also e.g. dmi inc. v. deere & co. 802_f.2d_421 425 231_uspq_276 278 fed.cir.1986 to reverse the jury the findings must not be supported by substantial_evidence ; shatterproof glass corp. v. libbey-owens ford co. 758_f.2d_613 619 225_uspq_634 636 fed.cir

) cert
denied 469_u.s._857 105_s.ct._187 83_l.ed.2d_120_(1984)` only when the court is convinced upon the record before the jury that reasonable persons could not have reached a verdict for the non-mover should it grant the motion for jnov'

on judicial_review following a duly made motion for judgment_n.o.v. the evidence must be viewed and reasonable_inferences drawn in the light most favorable to the party with the jury_verdict
continental_ore_co. v. union_carbide & carbon_corp. 370_u.s._690 696 82_s.ct._1404 1409 8_l.ed.2d_777_(1962) ; danny kresky enterprises corp. v. magid 716_f.2d_206 209 3d cir.1983 ; chuy 595 f.2d at 1273
the reviewing court is not free to reweigh the evidence or substitute its own judgment for that of the jury blair v. manhattan life ins co. 692_f.2d_296 300 3d cir.1982 or to pass on the credibility of witnesses
kinnel v. mid-atlantic mausoleums inc. 850_f.2d_958 961 3d cir.1988
those functions are assigned to the fact-finder in this case the jury
our function is to determine only whether there is evidence upon which the jury could properly return a verdict viewing the evidence most favorably to kinnel the non-movant and giving kinnel the benefit of all reasonable_inferences
id.at 961-62

the federal_circuit is in accord
e.g. orthokinetics 806 f.2d at 1572-73 1 uspq2d at 1085-86 it is` a misunderstanding of our appellate role' for this court to determine what is supported by the evidence as a whole rather than whether the evidence the jury could have believed was substantial ; connell v. sears roebuck & co. 722_f.2d_1542 1546 220_uspq_193 197 fed.cir.1983 the appellate_court must consider all the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-movant must not determine the credibility of witnesses and must not substitute its choice for that of the jury in finding facts drawing inferences or deciding between conflicting elements in the evidence
these are functions of the trier of fact not the reviewing court

these precepts are not here followed
the panel_majority has rejected the jury_verdict although it is supported by substantial_evidence and could clearly have been reached by a reasonable_jury
indeed the panel_majority has ignored much of the evidence that was presented at trial ; see part b post
the majority instead imposes the new_requirements of` particularized_testimony and linking_argument' that were set forth in lear_siegler inc. v. sealy_mattress_co. 873_f.2d_1422 10_uspq2d_1767_(fed.cir.1989)
these requirements which apply solely to jury_trials were not referred to at the trial for lear_siegler was decided eight months after this jury_verdict was rendered.2

*1334 these new_requirements are not trivial
they demand a certain stylized testimony and specified attorney_argument when trial is to a jury
as compared with trial to the bench these requirements must be fulfilled no matter how simple the invention
the court holds that if this extra testimony and extra argument are omitted the case can not go to the jury at all-no matter whether the evidence might suffice were the trial to the court
the panel_majority applying lear_siegler to remove this case from the jury has invoked a new_requirement of proof of equivalency proof of not only the three graver_tank` prongs' of` function way and result' but also a fourth_prong of` why'

it is contrary to due_process to revise the evidentiary and procedural burdens of the trial after the jurys verdict has been rendered
were these new criteria for jury_trials indeed required to be applied to this case then in the interest of justice a new_trial not reversal of the jury_verdict is the appropriate remedy
see cone v. west virginia pulp & paper co. 330_u.s._212 216_n._4 67_s.ct._752 755_n._4 91_l.ed._849_(1947) court always has discretion when justice requires to order a new_trial ; roebuck v. drexel university 852_f.2d_715 735-36 3d cir.1988 granting new_trial when verdict contrary to the great_weight of evidence ; 9 c._wright & a._miller federal_practice and procedure ¡± 2539_at_608_(2d_ed._1971) court may grant new_trial when verdict is against the great_weight of the evidence even when there is insufficient basis for granting judgment_n.o.v

in addition as i shall discuss even these new_requirements were met in this thoroughly presented case
even on the legal and evidentiary standards adopted by the panel_majority there is not sufficient basis for reversal of this jury_verdict

b
the trial
the patented invention of jacob_h._malta is a musical handbell that can be rapidly adjusted so that the bell_tone is changed` on the fly' during performance of a musical composition
it is not a complicated device

because of the rapid adjustability of the bells that malta invented performers have achieved musical effects not previously available in the old indeed ancient art of handbell_music
after this handbell was produced composers of handbell_music adopted a new system of notation for handbell scores
music for handbells was now written that could not have been performed before
patent validity was conceded at trial

the patent drawing shows the malta_bell

*1335. ?
-- -- claim 3 the only claim at issue is directed to the entire bell as discussed infra
the rotation of the clapper to change the striking surface thereby changing the bell_tone was well known
the novel contribution of the malta_bell to the art was the mechanism for rapid adjustment of the clapper during performance ; that aspect is not here challenged
the issue on this appeal is the jury_verdict of equivalency a verdict that required the jury to consider certain known interchangeable clapper structures

[ this was the other new element ; its presence in the accused bells was admitted ] mr._malta was a principal witness on the question of infringement
he identified each of the elements of the claims and the corresponding_element of the accused bells
the jury was shown 24¡² x 30¡² photographs of the details of disassembled bells and mr._malta used transparent_overlays identifying each part of the accused bells and the corresponding_element in each claim

he also testified with the aid of seven 24¡² x 30¡² drawings for each claim each drawing highlighting in color a different part of the accused bells and labelled to show the corresponding_element of the claims
from these photographs and drawings mr._malta compared each claim_element with the corresponding_element in the accused bells
the jury viewed a videotaped musical_performance during which malta stopped the tape to show the patented bells being quickly adjusted by the performers

it was explained to the jury that what was new in maltas bells was his means for rapidly changing the striking_surfaces during a musical_performance
mr._malta demonstrated how the clapper is rotated during performance and click-locked into the desired striking position the new_elements of the claimed combination
it was not disputed by schulmerich that these new_elements as well as all the other elements of claim 3 except the form of the striking_surfaces were literally present in the accused bells

malta demonstrated to the jury how the different striking_surfaces produced different tones
he explained to the jury that it was not new to use striking_surfaces of different_hardness on the bell clapper in order to change the bell_tone
the jury was shown bell clappers two hundred years old having this feature
malta also explained that it was not new to use clappers having the striking_surfaces illustrated in the patent ; that these striking_surfaces were known
the issue before the jury was simply the equivalence of the two sets of known striking_surfaces that were described in the patent
there was substantial_evidence of the equivalence of these striking_surfaces
i shall discuss some of this evidence for the panel_majority does not

for example the patent_specification shows the felt and plastic_striking_surfaces that are used in the accused bells and also shows the button striking_surfaces of claim 3
the patent_specification discusses their relationship and explains that the varying hardness of these surfaces varies the tone of the bell
these embodiments are illustrated in figures 3_and_7 of the patent

*1338. ?
?
-- -- - schulmerich did not dispute that the accused bells use the embodiment of figure 3
in evidence was the patent_specification which describes the figure 3 striking_surfaces as follows the striking surface of the ring 64 [ of the clapper ] may offer different_hardness strike surfaces 68 therearound for varying the tone
this is accomplished by drilling or molding relief portions 69 adjacent the surfaces
a third opposed pair of striking_surfaces may also be provided wherein felt or some other relatively soft_material is applied to opposed_striking_surfaces of the clapper 26
in this embodiment the clapper will offer three opposed areas of strike each with a different impact effect and available according to its position relative to the plane of swing of the clapper 26
the specification also discusses the striking_buttons of figure 7 and relates them to the figure 3 embodiment and to the invention as a whole opposed pairs of buttons 82 are of the same_hardness and each opposed pair is of a different_hardness to accomplish the same_results as described in connection with the clapper shown in fig._3
it is apparent that other deviations may also be used without departing from the spirit of my invention which comprehends a manually adjustable clapper having a plurality of strike_portions in opposed relation and of different_hardness to selectively produce a variety of tonal effects
i emphasize that the striking_surfaces used in the schulmerich_bells the only claim_element for which equivalence was at issue were described as well as pictured in the patent.3 the patent_specification describes how the hardness of the` strike_portions' is varied and how these alternative_embodiments function to change the tone of the bell

malta explained all this at trial with explicit reference to the claimed invention and the accused bells
he testified that the felt striking_surfaces in the schulmerich_handbells shown in fig._3 of the patent function in the same_way and with the same_effect as the softest pair of buttons fig._7 to produce a soft tone
he testified that the plastic_striking_surfaces fig._3 and the plastic_surfaces with slots fig._3 of the schulmerich_handbells function in the same_way and with the same_effect as the harder and medium pairs of buttons *1339 fig._7 to produce the brilliant and medium tones

malta also explained this correspondence between the striking_surfaces of the claimed and the accused bells using a color-highlighted drawing labelled with the relevant claim_clause
for example q would you make that clear as to what the structure is in the schulmerich_bell that corresponds to the buttons that are recited in the claim ?
a all right
the structure is these portions of the clapper in this case the opposed felt pieces and adjacent thereto on each side these elliptical_spots of green indicating that there are additional_pairs of opposed_striking_surfaces
q striking surfaces
would you go on with your explanation of how the portion illustrated in color in the exhibit_corresponds to the claim_language ?
a right
the-as i described we have a plurality of buttons theres three sets buttons or the equivalent thereof and they are in opposed pairs around the periphery
weve described how they are related to these indexing_slots in the underside of the brass_clapper_insert and each pair has a different_degree of hardness weve described that
here again we have felt which produced a soft_impact_sound
here this would be in relation to this slotted_portion here where we have a slot in the core and at 180 degrees another slot that would be the medium_impact_position
and then the lowermost_one would be the-this one opposed to this where we have a solid_plastic_material in the impact_plane producing a brilliant_sound
malta here and elsewhere did compare each pair of striking_surfaces and did explain to the jury the way the various striking_surfaces changed the tone of the bell
as further evidence of the equivalence of the striking_surfaces it was explained to the jury that the prior_art574_patent describes the same felt plastic and slotted_plastic_surfaces as were shown to be present in the accused bells as were shown to be pictured in figure 3 of the patent in suit and as were discussed by malta in his testimony
a 1902 catalogue of prior_art_bells about which malta also testified shows` pins' of different_materials on a rotatable clapper
mr._malta explained and demonstrated to the jury that the use of striking_surfaces made from material of varying degrees of hardness was known in the prior_art ; and that the use both of striking_buttons and striking_surfaces made of felt plastic and plastic with slots to produce varying degrees of hardness was known in the prior_art
this comports with the holding in graver_tank 339 u.s. at 609 70 s.ct.at 856 85 uspq at 331 that proof of equivalence` can be made.. by the disclosures of the prior_art'

the panel_majority holding that there was insufficient_evidence of equivalency to present the issue to a jury appears to concentrate its attack on maltas evidence of the` way' aspect of the function/way/result test of graver_tank
the panel_majority finds an inadequate showing of why the elements work in the same_way

following is another example of the testimony in which malta explained and demonstrated the` way' the bells work by rotating the clapper and aligning the surfaces of varying degrees of hardness in the striking plane
the witness also explained` why' describing the felt surfaces the slotted_plastic and the solid_surfaces q [ e ] xplain to the jury what you mean about changing the brightness or color
demonstrate it.. a may i demonstrate it ?
q.. you will.. certainly certainly
a all right
right now this clapper is aligned so that there are felt surfaces in the striking plane
the clapper is restricted in its motion so that it will only move through one plane and its going to be moving toward you
ill ring it now
( rings a bell
there weve got a rather soft mellow sound
i turn it to the next indexing spot and this spot are the opposed_surfaces contain cord in molded in slots
these slots will allow the plastic_surface to give to compress
and in so doing the tone that results will be brighter because we do not have felt covering the surface felt *1340 being softer but it will not be as bright as it will in the next_position which well use opposed_surfaces where there are no cord_slots
( rings a bell
and now ill dampen the bell and ive turned it already to the third position which utilizes solid_surfaces and strike it
( rings a bell
and again weve got a brighter sound
ill run through it now quickly
( rings a bell
the jury was not` left to its own_imagination' as my colleagues hold on the` function way and result' determination of equivalency
although the panel_majority_states that malta presented only` offhand' and` conclusory' evidence that statement does not accord with the record

maltas testimony on infringement took most of three days
each claim_clause was compared with its embodiment in the accused handbells using real demonstrative and testimonial evidence for literal_infringement and for equivalency
there was substantial_evidence of the function way and result of the striking_surfaces of the accused handbells compared with the striking_surfaces of the claimed invention
there was substantial_evidence not only as to this specific_claim_element but also as to the invention as a whole leaving no theory of equivalency uncovered
compare pennwalt corp. v. durand-wayland inc. 833_f.2d_931 4_uspq2d_1737_(fed.cir.1987) en banc cert
denied 485_u.s._961 108_s.ct._1226 99_l.ed.2d_426_(1988) requiring presence of every claim_element literally or by an equivalent with graver_tank 339 u.s. at 607-08 70 s.ct.at 855-56 85 uspq at 330 equivalency is determined of the invention as a whole

looking first at the invention as a whole there was substantial_evidence that the accused bell functioned by instantaneous hand adjustment of the clapper as does the claimed bell ; changing the striking_surfaces of varying hardness thereby changing the tone of the bell
as to way there was substantial_evidence of how the tone is changed on rotation of the clapper due to the change in hardness of the surface in the striking plane for the claimed and the accused bells
as to result there was substantial_evidence of the rapidly adjustable changes in tone of the accused bell as in the claimed bell to obtain soft medium and hard tones

the jury was instructed that in order to find infringement every element of the claim or the equivalent of every element must be present in the accused device.4 looking at the specific_claim_element for which equivalency was at issue i.e. the` plurality of striking_buttons in opposed pairs having different_degrees of hardness' again there was testimonial documentary and real evidence of the function way and result that characterize this element in the accused bells and equivalency to the function way and result that characterize the corresponding_element of the claim
malta presented substantial_evidence that the function of the opposed pairs of felt/plastic_striking_surfaces in the schulmerich_bells and of the opposed pairs of striking_buttons of the claim is to produce varying tones on striking the bell
using physical and documentary evidence malta testified that the felt solid plastic and slotted_plastic_surfaces of the accused bells` function like buttons'

malta also presented substantial_evidence that the way the striking_surfaces produce varying tones is by their varying degrees of hardness in the accused bells and in the claimed invention
he pointed to the accused striking_surfaces using a *1341 color-highlighted drawing and testified that` these are the three positions that i described earlier on the clapper that produce the hard medium and soft' and that` each pair has a different_degree of hardness'
i quoted ante maltas discussion of how slots in the plastic_surface affect the tone these slots will allow the plastic_surface to give to compress
and in so doing the tone that results will be brighter because we do not have felt covering the surface felt being softer but it will not be as bright as it will in the next_position which well use opposed_surfaces where there are no cord_slots
the malta_patent in evidence and the subject of testimony before the jury also describes the way both sets of striking_surfaces function ; see figures 3_and_7 pictured ante and the description in the patent_specification

although the panel_majority now holds that malta was required to explain how and why these known surfaces work in the way that they were known and shown to work at least when trial is to a jury schulmerich did not raise this point ; not on motion for directed_verdict not in its requested jury_instructions not on motion for judgment_n.o.v. and not in its appellate brief
as a criterion of equivalency it is unprecedented

however as i have stated mr._malta did explain how and why
he explained that felt is` softer' than plastic and he explained that the slots` allow the plastic to give to compress' producing a less brilliant_sound than the solid plastic_surfaces
he was not required to explain` why'
an inventor need not know the why of the scientific and technologic principles underlying an invention
diamond rubber co. v. consolidated rubber tire co. 220_u.s._428 435-36 31_s.ct._444 447 55_l.ed._527_(1911) ; fromson v. advance offset plate inc. 720_f.2d_1565 1570 219_uspq_1137 1140 fed.cir.1983
for example in graver_tank it was not required that the patentee explain why manganese and magnesium have similar_properties in the claimed composition-an explanation requiring an understanding of atomic structure and chemical forces
rather it was the observed fact of the similar_properties when used in the claimed composition that was legally significant.5

malta also provided substantial_evidence that the resulting change of tones is the same for the striking_surfaces of the accused bells and those of claim 3
he testified to the` different impact sounds' and` different tonal effect' that result
all of this evidence was specific to the issue of equivalency of the striking_buttons and the felt/plastic/slotted_plastic_surfaces

the evidence was thorough and if anything redundant
it is hard to imagine what more would have been appropriate
malta surely met that threshold quantity and quality of evidence required for consideration by the jury of the factual question of equivalency
a reasonable_jury viewing this evidence could have found that these known alternative_embodiments were equivalent

the fundamental right of litigants to a jury_trial is impugned by the creation of new evidentiary rules after the trial is over
`` [ t ] he procedures by which the facts of the case are determined assume an importance fully as great as the validity of the substantive rule of law to be applied'
speiser v. randall 357_u.s._513 520 78_s.ct._1332 1339 2_l.ed.2d_1460_(1958) misplacement of burdens of proof and persuasion violated procedural safeguards
by holding that malta was required to present evidence of` why' because the factfinder was a jury the majority creates a new *1342 substantive and procedural rule of uncertain soundness as well as treading upon due_process

c. the jury instructions
the parties agreed on the law to be applied
there was no objection to the jury_instructions
agreed instructions are subject to the general rule that failure to object will bar a later challenge to the law that was applied
fed.r.civ.p
51 no party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless that party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection
see also e.g. united_states v. 78.40 acres of land 384_f.2d_746_(3d_cir.1967) counsel had no suggestions or objections to the jury_charge thus waiving assignment of error ; allen organ co. v. kimball int l inc. 839_f.2d_1556 1566 5_uspq2d_1769 1777 fed.cir

schulmerich did not request jury_instructions on any of the points on which the panels majority opinions now rely
in instructing the jury on infringement in terms of the doctrine of equivalents the trial_court used the classical words of graver_tank 339 u.s. at 609 70 s.ct.at 856 85 uspq at 331 ; and also explained the law of equivalency in light of other factual aspects of equivalency that had been raised at the trial infringement under the doctrine of equivalents may exist if the accused handbells perform substantially the same_function in substantially the same_way so as to obtain substantially the same_results as the claimed invention
ill repeat that
infringement under the doctrine of equivalents may exist if the accused handbells perform substantially the same_function in substantially the same_way so as to obtain substantially the same_results as the claimed invention
what constitutes equivalency must be determined considering the context of the patent what were talking about the prior_art and the particular circumstances of the case
the smaller the advance over the prior_art that is whats in the prior field the narrower the range of available equivalents
also it must be kept in mind that the doctrine of equivalents has certain limits
for example the doctrine may not be used to support an interpretation that would resurrect or reopen subject_matter surrendered or dropped during prosecution of the patent application or subject_matter that is in the realm of public information
additionally the scope of the patent may not be expanded or extended so far that theyve become invalid or meaningless in light of the scope of the prior_art
also equivalents must be established with respect to the claims of the patent not for commercial purposes for which the products are used
in applying the doctrine of equivalents remember that infringement requires that each and every element of an asserted claim or the equivalent of the element must be present in the accused device
schulmerichs counsel said` i think it was a nice charge'

neither member of the panel_majority directs criticism to the jury_instructions

it must be assumed that the jury followed the courts instructions
aspen skiing co. v. aspen highlands skiing corp. 472_u.s._585 604 105_s.ct._2847 2858 86_l.ed.2d_467_(1985)
a reasonable_jury applying these instructions in light of the evidence could have found infringement of claim 3 under the doctrine of equivalents
the record shows that there was substantial_evidence on which the jury could rely to *1343 find equivalency
see kinnel 850 f.2d at 961-62 verdict must be affirmed if there is the minimum amount of evidence on which the jury could rely giving the nonmovant the benefit of all reasonable_inferences

i can not discern and the panel_majority does not explain how the jury was` put to sea without guiding charts'
in addition to the well-organized testimony there were the actual_bells the photographs the charts the videotape the description and drawings in the patent and the prior_art
there were examination and cross-examination opposing witnesses and experts
all of the exhibits were taken to the jury room
these bells are simple devices
the majoritys criticism that this jury was` left to its own_imagination' on the technical and legal_issue of equivalency is belied by the record
any legal gap was waived by failure to object to the jury_instructions mcadam v. dean witter reynolds inc. 896_f.2d_750 768-69 3d cir.1990 ; and any technical gap must be measured by the established standard for review of jury_verdicts
denneny 407 f.2d at 439 the jury_verdict must be sustained unless the record` is critically deficient of that minimum_quantum of evidence from which a jury might reasonably afford relief'
on the correct_standard the jury_verdict must be upheld

d. the new rules for jury trials
eight months after this jury_verdict was rendered this court held in lear_siegler inc. v. sealy_mattress_co. 873_f.2d_1422 10_uspq2d_1767_(fed.cir.1989) that proof of equivalency requires a different evidentiary standard and enlarged attorney explanation when a jury is the trier of fact as compared with trial to the court
both members of the panel_majority rely on this holding or at least on the dictum to similar effect in nestier see n. 2 supra

as i have discussed the lear_siegler_requirements of` particularized_testimony and linking_argument' in jury_trials are in conflict with graver_tank 339 u.s. at 609 70 s.ct.at 856 85 uspq at 331 wherein the court made clear that proof of equivalence` can be made in any form'
if as both members of the panel_majority insist the lear_siegler_requirements are not new their unprotested absence from the jury_instructions and from every other aspect of the trial means that they were waived
and this panels new_requirement that there be evidence of` why' as well as` function way and result' contravenes the holding of graver_tank that` equivalence in the patent law is not the prisoner of a formula'
339 u.s. at 609 70 s.ct.at 856 85 uspq at 330.6

the new_requirements also conflict with the truism that attorney_argument is not evidence 1 wigmore on evidence ¡± 1 b at p. 7 tillers rev
1983 and with the further truism that` the required findings are controlled by the courts instructions to the jury' dmi 802 f.2d at 425 231 uspq at 279
there is also conflict with the rule that the appellate_court must view the evidence and draw reasonable_inferences in the light most favorable to the party with the verdict link v. mercedes-benz of north america inc. 788_f.2d_918 921 3d cir.1986 ; and conflict with the proscription against appellate fact-finding [ c ] onflicting evidence which could reasonably lead to inconsistent conclusions will not justify a judgment notwithstanding the verdict or a directed_verdict
it is the function of the trier of fact alone the jury in this instance to evaluate contradictory_evidence and to draw inferences therefrom

denied 429_u.s._1053 97_s.ct._767 50_l.ed.2d_770_(1977) citations omitted

an additional conflict with precedent arises in the panel_majoritys treatment of expert testimony
although malta testified as an expert the majority rejects that *1344 testimony as insufficient under its new approach to jury_trials
compare e.g. symbol technologies inc. v. opticon inc. 935_f.2d_1569 1574-76 19_uspq2d_1241 1245-46 fed.cir.1991 wherein this court held that under the federal_rules of evidence an experts testimony on infringement including claim charts was sufficient to establish a prima_facie_case of infringement
see sartor v. arkansas natural gas corp. 321_u.s._620 627-28 64_s.ct._724 728-29 88_l.ed._967_(1944) where trial_court admits opinion testimony it is for jury to decide what if any weight to assign it
here maltas testimony is being held insufficient as a matter of law for failure to meet the majoritys retrospectively imposed requirements for jury_trials

todays paternalistic ruling that more and different evidence and argument are required when infringement is tried to a jury diverts patent jury_trials from the mainstream of the law a place assured by history and once accepted by the federal_circuit so long as the seventh amendment stands the right to a jury_trial should not be rationed nor should particular issues in particular types of cases be treated differently from similar issues in other types of cases
connell v. sears roebuck 722 f.2d at 1547 220 uspq at 197
[ i ] t is appropriate to affirm unequivocally that patent litigants are entitled to neither a greater nor a lesser but to the same right to a jury_trial under the same governing considerations as are all other litigants

denied 469_u.s._871 105_s.ct._220 83_l.ed.2d_150_(1984) this court stated there is of course no reason for considering patent cases as somehow out of the mainstream of the law and rules of procedure applicable to jury_trials for centuries under our jurisprudence
the retroactive_imposition of these new rules and resultant reversal of the jury_verdict also contravenes the guidance of chevron_oil_co. v. huson 404_u.s._97 92_s.ct._349 30_l.ed.2d_296_(1971) discussing retroactive_imposition of law

this court is changing not only the rules governing jury_trials but the rules of appellate_review
the mischief is well illustrated in todays post hoc retrospectively imposed micro-management of the jury_trial process
it is inimical to due_process for litigants and trial_judges will not know when the federal_circuit will decide on appeal that a particular issue required more explanatory testimony and attorney_argument at a jury_trial than either the parties or the trial_judge deemed necessary or the law required

the role of the jury in civil litigation is not ours to change
see h.t
markey on simplifying patent trials 116_f.r.d._369 370 1987 there is neither reason nor authority for employing in a patent trial procedures and practices different from those employed in any other civil trial
indeed reason and authority mandate the contrary
on appellate_review after the motion for judgment_n.o.v
has been made and decided the appellate_court shall` apply the same standard as the trial_court'
simone v. golden nugget hotel and casino 844_f.2d_1031 1034 3d cir.1988
the standards for granting a motion for judgment_n.o.v. on which the constitutionality of such action depends are the same as those governing the direction of a verdict
thus the motion for judgment_n.o.v
may be granted only when without weighing the credibility of the evidence there can be but one reasonable conclusion as to the proper judgment
where there is sufficient conflicting evidence or insufficient_evidence to conclusively establish the movants case judgment_n.o.v
should not be awarded
in considering the motion the court must view the evidence in the light and with all reasonable_inferences most favorable to the party who secured the jurys verdict

the jury has historically been charged with the factual inquiry of equivalency the question whether one thing is a mechanical equivalent for another is a question of fact for the jury on the testimony of experts or an inspection of the machines ; and it is an inference to be drawn from all the circumstances of the case by attending to the consideration whether the contrivance used by the defendant is used for the same purpose performs the same duties or is applicable to the same object as the contrivance used by the patentee

the dissent has attempted to draw out the function way and result achieved by the accused and claimed devices from the testimony quoted in the dissenting opinion
however its conclusion as to what those functions ways and results are does not come from the testimony itself but from maltas appeal brief and from its own conjecture
while lear_siegler does not go so far as to require recitation of the magic words` function'` way' and` result' we think that it at least requires the evidence to establish what the function way and result of both the claimed device and the accused device are and why those functions ways and results are substantially the same

lear_siegler itself described this aspect of nestier as dictum for in nestier the issue of equivalency was waived at trial and this court held on appeal simply that it was not error for the trial_court to have refused to give a jury_instruction on an issue that was not before the jury

in maltas case however the asserted equivalent was a known alternative and was described in the patent document ; this was explained to the jury

this explains why the jury did not find infringement of claim 2 for that claim requires the presence of an additional element the indexing means that was not found present in the schulmerich_bells
that finding carries no inference as to equivalency of the claim_element here at issue for there was no prosecution history limiting this claim_element
estoppel applies to claim changes made to overcome prior_art ; not to the space between broader and narrower claim_clauses
see loctite corp. v. ultraseal ltd. 781_f.2d_861 871 228_uspq_90 96 fed.cir.1985 the reason for the difference in claim scope must be considered
the verdict that claim 2 was not infringed was not appealed and does not carry the` implication' with which the majority seeks to clothe it
there is no presumption or per se rule that a claimed element is not entitled to any equivalents whenever another claim describes that element in broader terms
