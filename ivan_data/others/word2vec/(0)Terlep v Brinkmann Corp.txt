linn circuit_judge
stephen k. terlep` terlep' appeals from the decision of the united_states_district_court for the western_district of arkansas` district_court' granting the motion of the brinkmann_corp. wal-mart_stores inc. and home_depot u.s.a. inc. collectively` brinkmann' for summary_judgment of non-infringement of u.s._patent_no._5594,433` the433_patent`
terlep v. brinkmann_corp. no._02-_cv-5127 w.d.ark
march_29,_2004` order i'
because the district_court correctly construed the claim_term` clear' and properly granted brinkmanns motion for summary_judgment of non-infringement we affirm

background
the433_patent relates to omni-directional_light emitting diode` led' lamps
leds are a desirable substitute for traditional incandescent lamps because of their increased lifetime higher resistance to shock and vibration and lower cost of production
however in contrast to an incandescent lamp which emits light omni-directionally the light from an led is emitted in a forward cone of less than 90 degrees
the433_patent is directed to the production of omni-directional_light by reflecting the cone of light from an led off a semi-spherical convex reflector

independent claim 1 recites with the terms at issue underlined 1
an omni-directional_led_lamp useful for traffic control and warning devices that reflects light in a 360 degree_circumferential_direction without having to rotate any components comprising a first_led ; a first semi-spherical reflector having a continuous convex reflective surface the first semi-spherical reflector mounted above the first_led wherein light from the first_led is reflected substantially in a 360 degree circumference rendering the first_led omni-directional ; and
*1381 a first clear_plastic_tubular_holder for tightly holding the first semi-spherical reflector oriented directly above the first_led in a stationary non rotating position wherein the first semi-spherical reflector reflects light in a 360 degree_circumferential_direction
'433_patent col._6,_ll._13-28

claim 4 depends from claim 1 and recites that the` first semi-spherical reflector includes a mirror finish deposited on a plastic shape'
id.at col._6,_ll._57-59

on november 28 1997 terlep filed suit against brinkmann alleging that brinkmanns products infringed claims 1_and_4 of the433_patent literally and under the doctrine of equivalents
the accused products are solar-powered lamps for pathway_lighting
the lamps were sold through retailers wal-mart and home_depot
these lamps use an led and a convex reflector that is less than a full half sphere
further because they are used for pathway_lighting the relative orientation between the reflector and the led when the product is in use is such that the reflector is located below the led
finally the brinkmann lights use a ribbed holder to align and position the reflector in front of the led
brinkmann denied infringement and filed a counterclaim alleging invalidity
the district_court construed a number of disputed terms and based on the claim_construction granted brinkmanns motion for summary_judgment of non-infringement and dismissed the claims with prejudice
order i

on april_14,_2004 terlep filed a notice of appeal
because the district_courts initial order did not address brinkmanns invalidity counterclaim this court determined that it lacked jurisdiction and dismissed the appeal
terlep v. brinkmann_corp. 127_fed.appx._498_(fed.cir.2005)
thereafter following a stipulation by the parties the district_court dismissed brinkmanns counterclaim without prejudice leaving no issues unresolved
terlep v. brinkmann_corp. no._02-_cv-5127 w.d.ark
march_24,_2005` order ii'

on march_10,_2005 terlep filed a new notice of appeal and a motion to reinstate
in an order entered april_11,_2005 this court recalled the mandate and reinstated the appeal
the appeal is now properly before us and we have jurisdiction under 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

discussion
terlep argues that the district_court erred in granting summary_judgment by concluding that the preamble of claim 1 of the433_patent was a limitation and that brinkmann did not meet the` above' and` clear' limitations of claim 1
brinkman responds that the district_court correctly construed these limitations and further that the district_courts judgment should be affirmed on the additional_grounds that the limitations` semi-spherical'` directly'` plastic' and` tubular' have not been met
because we conclude that the district_court correctly construed the` clear' limitation of claim 1 and because summary_judgment of non-infringement was proper on that basis we do not consider terleps other arguments or brinkmans additional_grounds for affirmance

claim construction
`` the construction of claims is simply a way of elaborating the normally terse claim_language in order to understand and explain but not to change the scope of the claims'
embrex inc. v. serv
eng g corp. 216_f.3d_1343 1347 fed.cir.2000 internal_quotations and citation omitted
interpreting the asserted claims entails a review of the intrinsic_evidence which consists of the claim_language the written description and the prosecution_history
see id
; vitronics corp. v. conceptronic inc. 90_f.3d_1576 1582 fed.cir.1996

`` [ t ] he specification is always highly relevant to the claim_construction analysis
usually it is dispositive ; it is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term'
phillips v. awh corp. 415_f.3d_1303 1314 fed.cir.2005 en banc internal_quotations omitted
`` [ t ] he prosecution_history can often inform the meaning of the claim_language by demonstrating how the inventor understood the invention and whether the inventor limited the invention in the course of prosecution making the claim_scope narrower than it would otherwise be'
id.at 1317
extrinsic evidence such as dictionaries also` may be considered if the court deems it helpful in determining the true meaning of the language used in the patent claims' id.at 1318 internal_quotations omitted provided the court` attach [ es ] the appropriate_weight.. to those sources in light of the statutes and policies that inform patent law' id.at 1324

the district_court construed the term` clear' of independent claim 1 to mean` transparent' or` having the property of transmitting light without appreciable_scattering so that bodies lying beyond are seen clearly'
order i at 7
terlep challenges the district_courts interpretation arguing that the term should be construed to also cover translucent_holders
terlep contends that the intrinsic record requires only that the word` clear' be construed to permit the passage of light
brinkmann responds that the district_courts construction is correctly informed by the written description which states that the purpose of the holder is to maximize light_output and that any other interpretation would be inconsistent with the433_patent
brinkmann adds that the` translucent' argument was not made to the district_court and thus was waived

*big_token__1383_claim_1__big_token recites an omni-directional_led_lamp that has three elements an led ; a semi-spherical reflector ; and a clear_plastic_tubular_holder
the claim sets forth the positional relation between these elements such that the light emitted from the led is rendered omni-directional after reflecting off the semi-spherical reflector
see433_patent col._6,_ll._26-27
the reflected light passes through the holder which holds the semi-spherical reflector
see id.at ll
24-28
the text of claim 1 and the other claims provide little guidance on the meaning of the term` clear'

the written description discloses a preferred embodiment in which the led is surrounded by` tubular canopies' or holders that are made of` clear and pliable plastic material'
id.at col._3,_ll._58-59
another embodiment describes a colored lens_cover that is made` from clear colored plastic'
id.at col._5,_l._1
while these passages are not particularly helpful in discerning the meaning of the term` clear' other portions of the written description provide greater guidance
the background and prior art sections state that various techniques for applying diffusion directly to the led surfaces had been attempted in the past and were unsuccessful in rendering the light emitted from the led omni-directional
id.at col._1,_ll._37-45
the summary of the invention section describes the invention as an omni-directional_led_lamp that does not use a diffusion lens over the leds
id.at col._2,_ll._5-7
implicit in these passages is the distinction between lenses or holders that diffuse or scatter light and those that transmit light without obstruction
the written description is thus consistent with and supports the district_courts construction of the term` clear' to refer to holders that are` transparent or [ have ] the property of transmitting light without appreciable_scattering so that bodies lying beyond are seen clearly'
order i at 7

terlep argues that the written description also is consistent with a` translucent' holder because it refers to an embodiment in which` the lens_cover.. can include a phosphorescent coating which glows when the led.. is on so as to diffuse light evenly over a wide viewing angle and amplify visibility'
see433_patent col._5,_ll._54-57
however the text quoted by terlep relates to the embodiment of figures 4a-4c which does not include a` clear_plastic_tubular_holder' as recited in claim 1 at issue in this case
because the` lens_cover' described supra is not the same structure as the` clear_plastic_tubular_holder' compare id. figures 4a-4c & col._5,_ll._54-57 with id. figure 2a & col._3,_ll._57-65 terleps argument is misplaced
moreover there is nothing in the description of the phosphorescent coating embodiment to warrant construction of the term` clear' as it relates to the` clear_plastic_tubular_holder' of claim 1 to include translucent_holders

the prosecution_history further supports the district_courts construction
on august 9 1995 the application that issued as the433_patent was filed
in a february 7 1996 office action the examiner inter_alia rejected claim 1_under_35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a as being unpatentable over u.s._patent_no._5469,157 to carpenter et al
in view of u.s. patent no._1198,734 to ludescher
in a may_6,_1996 response` response' terlep amended claim 1 to add inter_alia` a clear_plastic_tubular_holder'
response at 1
terlep distinguished the claimed invention from the prior_art stating that the prior_art disclosed rotating leds and leds having a top` flattened and.. side surface s.. sandblasted or otherwise roughened to diffuse the light_output' whereas the` subject invention did not use anyflattened tops and/orsandblasted or roughened sides'
response at 5
because the` clear plastic *1384 tubular holder' limitation helped distinguish the prior_art from the claimed invention the prosecution_history supports construing the term` clear' to exclude plastic holders that are translucent or otherwise diffuse the light emitted from the led
see seachange int l inc. v. c-cor inc. 413_f.3d_1361 1372-73 fed.cir.2005` where an applicant argues that a claim possesses a feature that the prior_art does not possess in order to overcome a prior_art rejection the argument may serve to narrow the scope of otherwise broad claim_language
``

in construing the claims the parties have cited several dictionaries
district courts are authorized` to rely on extrinsic evidence which consists of all evidence external to the patent and prosecution_history including.. dictionaries' as one of many claim_construction tools
phillips 415 f.3d at 1317 internal citations omitted
the dictionary defines` clear' as` giving free passage to light or to the sight easily seen through not cloudy turbid or opaque'
websters third int l dictionary 419 1993
this definition lists` transparent' and` translucent' as synonyms
the definition also sets forth an express distinction between transparent and translucent` transparent stresses complete absence of obstruction to vision' and` translucent applies to that which permits passage of light but bars clear and complete vision'
id
the distinction between these synonyms can not be ignored
see int l rectifier corp. v. ixys corp. 361_f.3d_1363 1374 2004 holding that it was improper for the district_court to adopt a definition that was attributed to a synonym of the disputed term while disregarding the distinction set forth in the usage note
moreover the distinction mirrors the distinction reflected in the written description and prosecution_history between the unobstructed passage of light of the holder of the patented_invention and the prior_art structures that diffuse light
here the district_court` attached appropriate_weight' to the dictionary definitions in the context of the intrinsic_evidence in reaching its construction of the claim_term` clear'
phillips 415 f.3d at 1324

finally terlep argues that to define` clear' so as to exclude` translucent' is to import a functional_limitation into the claim
terlep asserts that` clear_plastic_tubular_holder' is merely a structural limitation and that the district_court erred in importing a functional_limitation into a structural term
however terlep fails to recognize that the construction properly adopted by the district_court merely assigned meaning to the claim_term` clear' and did not impermissibly import a functional_limitation
merck & co. v. teva pharms
usa inc. 395_f.3d_1364 1372 fed.cir.2005` a claim_construction that gives meaning to all the terms of the claim is preferred over one that does not do so
``

we conclude that the district_court correctly construed the term` clear' to mean` transparent or having the property of transmitting light without appreciable_scattering so that bodies lying beyond are seen clearly' and that nothing in the claims or the written description warranted giving the term` clear' an expansive meaning that would cover` translucent' holders
because terleps` translucent' argument is without merit we need not consider brinkmanns additional argument of waiver

infringement
`` [ f ] or a court to find infringement the plaintiff must show the presence of every element or its substantial equivalent in the accused device'
wolverine world wide inc. v. nike inc. 38_f.3d_1192 1199 fed.cir.1994 ; see also warner-jenkinson *1385 co. v. hilton davis chem co. 520_u.s._17 40 117_s.ct._1040 137_l.ed.2d_146_(1997) noting that because each limitation contained in a patent claim is material to defining the scope of the patented_invention a doctrine of equivalents analysis must be applied to individual claim limitations not to the invention as a whole
`` application of the rule precluding use of the doctrine of equivalents to recapture claim_scope surrendered during patent acquisition is a question of law'
kcj corp. v. kinetic concepts inc. 223_f.3d_1351 1359 fed.cir.2000

claim 1 recites a` clear_plastic_tubular_holder'
the district_court concluded that there was no genuine_issue of material_fact that none of the accused products had a transparent_holder
order i at 10
terlep argues that some of the brinkmann_products have a clear plastic cover
however terlep does not dispute the fact that although some of brinkmanns products have a transparent cover none of them have a transparent_holder
terlep also does not contest that the brinkmann_products are ribbed and that the ribbed holders scatter the light shining from inside to prevent bodies inside the holder from being seen clearly
id
thus terlep has failed to provide any basis for us to conclude that the district_court erred in determining that there was no genuine_issue of material_fact that the accused devices do not meet the` clear_plastic_tubular_holder' limitation of claim 1
because claim 4 depends from claim 1 and also possesses this limitation it too is not literally infringed

terlep also challenges the district_courts grant of summary_judgment of non-infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
specifically terlep argues that the district_court erred in foreclosing its assertion of the doctrine of equivalents by reason of prosecution_history estoppel
it asserts this argument despite its acknowledgement that the` clear_plastic_tubular_holder' limitation was added during prosecution to help overcome the prior_art
terlep claims that this amendment does not bar it from asserting equivalents under the doctrine announced in festo_corp. v. shoketsu_kinzoku_kogyo_kabushiki_co. ltd. 535_u.s._722 733 122_s.ct._1831 152_l.ed.2d_944_(2002)
under festo a narrowing amendment made to satisfy a requirement of the patent act may give rise to an estoppel
id.at 736 122_s.ct._1831
such a narrowing amendment creates a presumption that the patentee surrendered the territory between the original claims and the amended claims
id.at 741 122_s.ct._1831
the patentee may rebut that presumption by showing that the alleged equivalent was unforeseeable at the time the amendment was made that the alleged equivalent was tangential to the purpose of that amendment or that there was some other reason suggesting that the patentee could not reasonably be expected to have described the insubstantial substitute in question
id.at 740-41 122_s.ct._1831

terlep argues that its amendment of claim 1 to include the limitation` clear_plastic_tubular_holder' does not estop it from asserting infringement under the doctrine of equivalents because the equivalent in question was tangential to the purpose of the amendment
the primary consideration in determining when an amendment bears only a tangential relation to the equivalent in question is` whether the reason for the amendment is peripheral or not directly relevant to the alleged equivalent'
insituform techs. inc. v. cat constr. inc. 385_f.3d_1360 1370 fed.cir.2004 citing festo_corp. v. shoketsu_kinzoku_kogyo_kabushiki_co. ltd. 344_f.3d_1359 1365 fed.cir.2003 en banc
terlep asserts that the prosecution *1386 history shows that the addition of the term` clear' was merely to describe the plastic used for the claimed` plastic holder' and thus the addition of that term is not directly relevant to the accused equivalent
however as discussed supra terlep amended claim 1 and argued patentability based on the diffusion characteristics of prior_art led devices and the absence of diffusion in the clear_plastic_tubular_holder of the claimed invention
thus it can not be said that the reason for adding` clear' was tangential to the accused equivalents which are holders that are ribbed and diffuse light
see festo 344 f.3d at 1369 noting that` the inquiry into whether a patentee can rebut the festo_presumption under thetangantial criterion focuses on the patentees objectively apparent reason for the narrowing amendment'
thus terlep has failed to rebut the festo_presumption and we affirm the district_courts grant of summary_judgment of non-infringement under the doctrine of equivalents as a matter of law

iii
conclusion
for the foregoing reasons we affirm the district_courts construction of the term` clear'
we also affirm the district_courts grant of brinkmanns motion of summary_judgment of non-infringement

affirmed
