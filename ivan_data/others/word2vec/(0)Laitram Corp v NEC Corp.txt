background
a
the invention
laitram is the assignee of the311_patent which` relates to high_speed electro-optical printing systems and particularly to systems employing radiation-sensitive image-recording mediums to produce records of information as type_characters and/or in graphic form'
see311_patent col._1,_ll._5-9
independent claim 1 is directed to such a printing apparatus and independent claim 2 is directed to a method for printing in this fashion
the parties dispute whether the scope of the original_claims was substantively changed following several amendments made during the reexamination of the311_patent
these amendments are emphasized in reexamined_claims 1_and_2 with deletions in brackets 1
an electro-optical printing apparatus for printing type_quality_alpha-numeric_characters at high_speed on a surface of photosensitive recording_material said apparatus comprising a plurality of rapidly reacting radiation_emitters each being capable of emitting radiation at wavelengths to which said surface is sensitive said emitters being disposed in an array along a substantially straight_line said array being a plurality of rows of said radiation_emitters ; means for moving said recording_material in a single direction substantially perpendicular to said straight_line with its surface adjacent to said array and at a substantially constant_speed relative to said array and ; means for selectively activating each of said emitters for predetermined_periods of time and
means for coordinating the predetermined period of time in which each of the said plurality of emitters are activated with said constant relative speed of said recording_material so that the radiation emitted by said emitters will be recorded on selected areas of said recording surface in the form of an alipha [ sic ] -numeric image each of said emitters being positioned to irradiate a different_area of said recording surface the different_areas of said surface irradiated by each of the said emitters being arranged in an overlapping relationship with one another and said plurality of emitters being of sufficient number to print said type_quality_alpha-numeric_characters
2
a method of electro-optically printing type_quality_alpha-numeric_characters at high_speed on the recording surface of a photosensitive_material said method comprising the steps of arranging a plurality of rapidly reacting radiation_emitters in a straight_line *1345 array each of the said emitters being capable of emitting radiation at wavelengths to which said photosensitive_material is sensitive selectively energizing for predetermined_periods of time each of the said emitters transmitting the emitted radiation from each of the said emitters to a different_area on said surface providing relative_movement along a single coordinate substantially perpendicular to said array at substantially constant_speed between said recording surface and said emitters and
coordinating the predetermined_periods of time in which each of said plurality of emitters [ are ] is selectively energized with said constant_speed of said relative_movement between said emitters and recording surface so that alpha-numeric_character_images are recorded on said recording surface by exposure of selected [ ares ] area of said recording surface by said emitted radiation said step of coordinating including the steps of synchronously generating a first data signal which programs the order [ to ] of energization of said emitters and a second data signal which determines the duration of the energization period of said emitters and employing said first and second data signals to effect energization of said emitters so as to record said alpha-numeric_character_images of said type_quality at said high_speed
see311_patent reexamination_certificate col._1,_ll._22-67 col._2,_ll._1-19 emphasis and bracketing in original paragraphing added
the added limitations generally address three aspects of the disclosed invention speed type_quality and direction of movement
because our conclusion regarding claim_identicality may be based on the type_quality amendment alone we limit our analysis to that limitation

b
the district_court
laitram and nec are before us for the fourth time,1 and we commence by charting the pertinent aspects of this protracted litigation
on april_10,_1989 laitram filed suit against nec for infringement of the311_patent
a third party initiated a reexamination proceeding and the suit was stayed pending the outcome of the reexamination
the patent and trademark office rejected apparatus claim 1 as obvious and method claim 2 as obvious and anticipated
laitram subsequently gained allowance of these claims after incorporating the speed type_quality and direction of movement_limitations outlined above
back in the district_court nec then successfully moved for partial summary judgment that the scope of the claims had been substantively changed so that laitrams damages would be limited to sales of nec printers occurring after the issuance of the reexamined_claims
see 35 u.s.c.¡±¡± 252 307 b 1994
in laitram_i we reversed holding that a claim_amendment made during reexamination following a prior_art_rejection is not automatically to be regarded as a substantive_change
see laitram_i 952 f.2d at 1362 21 uspq2d at 1280
thus laitrams amendments were not` per se' substantive_changes
following a trial after remand the jury found that the claims were willfully infringed and that the original and reexamined_claims were substantively identical
pursuant to fed.r.civ.p
50 b nec moved for jmol on three issues
the district judge granted necs motion for jmol of non-infringement but denied necs motions for jmol on willfulness and claim_identicality as both issues were now concluded to be moot
in laitram_ii we reversed the district_courts grant of jmol of noninfringement and remanded instructing the district_court` to reinstate the jurys verdict'
laitram_ii 62 f.3d at 1395 36 uspq2d at 1211
the district_court interpreted our mandate to require reinstatement of the entire jury verdict including the verdicts concerning willfulness and claim_identicality and it denied necs rule 60 b motion requesting relief from the denial of its jmol_motions on willfulness and claim_identicality *1346 as moot
furthermore the district_court held that in spite of the jurys verdict of willful infringement enhanced damages were not appropriate because the infringement and willfulness issues were both` close'
the court also denied attorney_fees to laitram

in laitram_iii we again reversed and remanded directing the court to consider necs jmol_motion on claim_identicality which had not been previously addressed by the district_court
see laitram_iii 115 f.3d at 956 42 uspq2d at 1904
however we held that the district_court did not abuse its discretion in denying either enhanced damages or attorney_fees and we concluded that the motion for jmol on willfulness was again rendered moot
we thus vacated the jurys verdict on willfulness and instructed the court to dismiss the jmol_motion on willfulness
see id.at 955-56 42 uspq2d at 1903-04

on remand the district_court denied necs motion for jmol on claim_identicality
the court concluded that the speed type_quality and direction of movement_limitations added by amendment were` implicit' in the original_claims and that therefore the amended claims were identical in scope to the original_claims
see order and reasons at 12
as to the` type_quality' limitation the court noted that the original_claims did not expressly state the quality of the image printed on the recording medium ; rather both claims simply state that` alpha-numeric_characters' are printed
the court turned to the written description to interpret the meaning of the term` alphanumeric_characters' and observed that the written description discloses a printing apparatus that generates` type_character' images
the court also noted that the written description defines the term` type_characters' as corresponding in size` to that of an ordinary typewriter and with type fonts typically employed therein'
see311_patent col._2,_ll._52-53
the court observed that laitrams uncontroverted expert testimony revealed that at the time of the invention a person having ordinary skill in the art would have deemed the term` type_character' to mean the quality of a mechanically produced type-written image i.e. a` type_quality' image
moreover the court observed that in numerous places the written description discloses a printer that prints` type_character' images
the court therefore concluded that the term` alphanumeric_characters' means` type_characters' and that because` type_characters' are those of` type_quality' the addition of the term` type_quality' did not substantively change the scope of the original_claims
nec appealed the denial of its jmol_motion
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1 1994

discussion
a patentee of a reexamined_patent is entitled to infringement damages inter alia for the period between the date of issuance of the original_claims and the date of issuance of the reexamined_claims if the original and reexamined_claims are` identical'
see 35 u.s.c.¡±¡± 252 307 b 1994 ; tennant co. v. hako minuteman inc. 878_f.2d_1413 1417 11_uspq2d_1303 1306 fed.cir.1989
reexamined claims are` identical' to their original counterparts if they are` without substantive_change'
seattle box co. v. industrial crating & packing 731_f.2d_818 827-28 221_uspq_568 575 fed.cir.1984 internal quotations omitted
furthermore in determining whether substantive_changes have been made we must discern whether the scope of the claims are identical not merely whether different words are used
see slimfold mfg co. v. kinkead indus. 810_f.2d_1113 1115 1_uspq2d_1563 1565 fed.cir.1987
if substantive_changes have been made to the original_claims the patentee is entitled to infringement damages only for the period following the issuance of the reexamination_certificate
see bloom eng g co. v. north am
mfg co. 129_f.3d_1247 1249-50 44_uspq2d_1859 1861 fed.cir.1997

`` this court reviews without deference the district_courts conclusion that the reexamined_claims remained identical in scope'
*1347 minco inc. v. combustion eng g inc. 95_f.3d_1109 1115 40_uspq2d_1001 1005 fed.cir.1996 citation omitted
this rule flows from the general principle that` the interpretation and construction of patent claims which define the scope of the patentees rights under the patent is a matter of law exclusively for the court'
see markman v. westview instruments inc. 52_f.3d_967 970-71 34_uspq2d_1321 1322 fed.cir.1995 en banc affd 517_u.s._370 116_s.ct._1384 134_l.ed.2d_577 38_uspq2d_1461_(1996) ; see also cybor v. fas tech. inc. 138_f.3d_1448 1451 46_uspq2d_1169 1171 fed.cir.1998 en banc holding that claim construction is a purely legal question reviewed by this court de novo

in laitram_i we held that a claim_amendment made during reexamination following a prior_art_rejection is not per se a substantive_change
laitram_i 952 f.2d at 1362 21 uspq2d at 1280
rather` [ t ] o determine whether a claim change is substantive it is necessary to analyze the claims of the original and the reexamined_patents in light of the particular facts including the prior_art the prosecution_history other claims and any other pertinent information'
id.at 1362-63 952_f.2d_1357 21 uspq2d at 1280
this inquiry however is circumscribed by the well-established principle that a court may not import limitations from the written description into the claims
see electro_med
sys
v. cooper life sciences inc. 34_f.3d_1048 1054 32_uspq2d_1017 1021 fed.cir.1994` [ c ] laims are not to be interpreted by adding limitations appearing only in the specification`
one key rationale for this rule is that
[ i ] f everything in the specification were required to be read into the claims or if structural claims were to be limited to devices operated precisely as a specification-described embodiment is operated there would be no need for claims
nor could an applicant regardless of the prior_art claim more broadly than that embodiment
sri_int l v. matsushita elec corp. of am. 775_f.2d_1107 1121 227_uspq_577 585 fed.cir.1985 en banc citations omitted
thus it is the claims not the written description which define the scope of the patent right
see novo nordisk of n. am
v. genentech inc. 77_f.3d_1364 1369 37_uspq2d_1773 1777 fed.cir.1996 ; sri_int l 775 f.2d at 1121 227 uspq at 585

nec argues that a plain_reading of the claims reveals that unlike original_claims 1_and_2 reexamined_claims 1_and_2 are limited to printing` type_quality' alphanumeric_characters and that significantly this limitation was added to the original_claims in order to distinguish them from the prior_art and thereby gain their allowance
nec therefore concludes that the scope of the original_claims has been substantively changed
laitram responds that nec is merely reasserting the` per se' argument that we rejected in laitram_i

nec also argues that in holding that the type_quality limitation was implicitly contained in the original_claims the district_court did more than use the written description to interpret claim_language but used it to read limitations into the claims
laitram counters that the original_claims when construed in light of the written description prosecution_history and language of the claims themselves implicitly contain the` type_quality' limitation
while laitram acknowledges that the term` type_quality' does not appear in the written description laitram asserts that the term` type_character` appears repeatedly throughout the written description and that this term is defined as the quality of type` produced by mechanical systems'
see311_patent col._2,_ll._57-58
laitram states that the written description indicates that in non-mechanical systems such as the claimed printing system` type_characters' are` substantially indistinguishable from mechanically formed characters' i.e.` type_quality` characters
see311_patent col._2,_ll._56-62
since laitram equates` alphanumeric_characters' with` type_characters' and` type_characters' with` type_quality characters' laitram concludes that the original_claims covered only alphanumeric_characters of type_quality

*1348 we agree with nec that the claims have been substantively changed
nec correctly observes that a plain_reading of the claims would indicate that the original and reexamined_claims are of different scope the original_claims appear to cover a printer or method of printing which generates any quality of alphanumeric_characters while the amended claims seem to cover only a printing apparatus or method of printing which generates` type_quality` alphanumeric_characters
most significantly however the addition of the` type_quality' limitation along with the other amendments resulted in the allowance of claims that had been rejected in the reexamination proceeding over prior_art ; this is a highly influential piece of prosecution_history
although it is difficult to conceive of many situations in which the scope of a rejected claim that became allowable when amended is not substantively changed by the amendment we arrive at our conclusion not through any` per se rule' but in light of an overall examination of the written description the prosecution_history and the language of the respective claims
see laitram_i 952 f.2d at 1363 21 uspq2d at 1280

laitrams argument that the scope of the claims has not been substantively changed is not persuasive as it requires a highly strained and incorrect construction of the claims
even assuming that laitram is correct in arguing that` type_characters' are defined as` characters of type_quality' we do not see how one can equate` type_characters' with` alphanumeric_characters'
the language of the claims indicates that` type_quality_alphanumeric_characters' are simply a species of the genus` alphanumeric_characters' and nothing in the written description persuades us otherwise
laitrams argument is just an invitation for us to read a limitation into the original_claims that is simply not there
as we explained in intervet [ t ] his court has consistently adhered to the proposition that courts can not alter what the patentee has chosen to claim as his invention that limitations appearing in the specification will not be read into claims and that interpreting what is meant by a word in a claim` is not to be confused with adding an extraneous limitation appearing in the specification which is improper'
intervet am. inc. v. kee-vet lab. inc. 887_f.2d_1050 1053 12_uspq2d_1474 1476 fed.cir
1989 citation omitted
laitram essentially argues that because the term` type_character' is used repeatedly throughout the written description the` type_quality' limitation is implicit in the original_claims
this argument is incorrect ; the mere repetition in the written description of a preferred aspect of a claimed invention does not limit the scope of an invention that is described in the claims in different and broader terms
see electro_med
sys. 34 f.3d at 1054 32 uspq2d at 1021` [ a ] lthough the specifications [ sic ] may well indicate that certain embodiments are preferred particular embodiments appearing in a specification will not be read into the claims when the claim_language is broader than such embodiments`
accordingly we decline to read the` type_quality' limitation into the original_claims and agree with nec that the district erred in doing so

the prosecution_history of the311_patent further strengthens our conclusion that the scope of the claims was substantively changed
laitram made the following statement in overcoming a ¡± 103 obviousness_rejection during reexamination from the above it is seen that claim 1 is allowable over the prior_art since neither baylis alone or in combination with either kikuchi christopherson et al
or the japanese patent shows or suggests the high_speed electro-optical_printer for printing alpha-numeric_characters of` type_quality' as specified in claim 1.. joint app.at a1410 emphasis added
similarly in overcoming the obviousness_rejection of claim 2 laitram argued that moreover the combination of innes and kikuchi does not show how to modify innes or kikuchi to obtain the claimed method of printing alpha-numeric_characters of` type' quality
*1349 id.at a1421 emphasis added
these excerpts clearly illustrate what the language of the claims itself indicates viz. that the terms` alphanumeric_characters' and` type_quality_alphanumeric_characters' are not synonymous but that the latter is a species of the former
accordingly the addition of the` type_quality' limitation narrowed the original_claims substantively changing them

we have considered the parties remaining arguments but find them unpersuasive

conclusion
based on our independent construction of the claim_language the written description and the prosecution_history we conclude that the district_court improperly read the` type_quality' limitation into original_claims 1_and_2
thus when laitram added this limitation during reexamination it narrowed the claims thereby substantively changing their scope
accordingly laitram is not entitled to infringement damages prior to the issuance of the reexamination_certificate
the decision of the district_court denying necs jmol_motion on this issue is therefore

reversed
