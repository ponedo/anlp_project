i
day_international inc.` day' is the holder of u.s._patent_no._4770,928` the ¡¬928_patent` entitled` method of curing a compressible printing blanket and a compressible printing blanket produced thereby' which issued on september 13 1988
the ¡¬928_patent relates to an improved_method of manufacturing compressible_printing_blankets used for printing newspapers magazines and other_products made using offset lithographic_printing_methods

printing blankets are used in the printing industry to transfer ink from a printing plate to paper
accurate image reproduction requires that a printing_blanket be capable of withstanding a certain amount of compression during the mechanical printing process yet be sufficiently resilient to return to its original thickness
to achieve this compressible quality printing_blankets are constructed as multi-layered assemblies of which at least one layer is made of an elastomeric_material into which tiny_voids have been introduced
the tiny_voids enable the elastomeric_material to absorb compressive forces such as those commonly experienced in the printing process
the following figure taken from the ¡¬928_patent reveals a cross-sectional cutout of a multi-layered printing_blanket where the compressible_layer 24 is shown containing voids 28

?
a variety of methods have been used in the prior_art to create the voids in the compressible_layer of a printing_blanket
one way of introducing these voids was to mix hollow_microcapsules into the elastomeric_material prior to the curing or vulcanization of the printing_blanket
however because the curing process must be done at temperatures high enough to transform the soft tacky elastomeric_material into a strong temperature-stable substance the hollow_microcapsules would melt before the elastomeric_material fully vulcanized causing agglomeration of voids
the resulting product was a compressible_layer with voids which lacked uniform_size and distribution a characteristic which adversely affected *1346 printing quality and the durability of the printing_blanket itself

the ¡¬928_patent is directed to an improved_method1 in which the compressible_layer is cured in a way that avoids the agglomeration_problem experienced in prior_art_processes
specifically as described in the ¡¬928_patent after the microcapsules have been evenly mixed into the elastomeric_material and laid down to form a compressible_layer the layer is initially cured at temperatures that are below the melting_point of the microcapsules but high enough to sufficiently set the structure of the polymeric matrix about them i.e. 110-170 degrees_f
¡¬928_patent col._5,_ll._55-63
this initial step is identified as a` low_temperature_cure' 2 in both the patent and its prosecution_history
¡¬928_patent col._6,_l._21
it serves to fix the position of the microcapsules in the compressible_layer thereby fixing the positions of the resultant voids as well
¡¬928_patent col._6,_ll._5-8 20-25 59-63

other layers are subsequently added to the initial vulcanized compressible_layer to form a complete printing_blanket and then the entire blanket assembly is cured again this time at curing temperatures high enough to melt the microcapsules i.e. 270-320 degrees_f thus forming voids in the compressible_layer
¡¬928_patent col._6,_ll._33-45
since the positions of the microcapsules have already been fixed by the initial low_temperature_cure the voids do not agglomerate or interconnect as they did in prior_art_processes
the result according to the ¡¬928_patent is a compressible printing_blanket with voids of substantially uniform_size and substantially even distribution throughout the compressible_layer
¡¬928_patent col._3,_ll._23-30

the asserted independent method claims in the ¡¬928_patent are claims 1_and_21
they state as follows 1
a method of making a laminated printing_blanket_construction comprising the steps of providing at least one fabric substrate layer forming an intermediate_compressible_layer of an elastomeric_material thereon said intermediate_compressible_layer having a substantially uniform_thickness and having microcapsules incorporated therein said microcapsules being substantially uniformly distributed throughout said intermediate_compressible_layer maintaining said intermediate_compressible_layer at a temperature below the melting_point of said microcapsules for a time sufficient to cause said elastomeric_material to vulcanize to a degree sufficient to substantially fix the positions of said microcapsules within said intermediate_compressible_layer providing a surface layer over said intermediate_compressible_layer to form said printing_blanket_construction and
vulcanizing said construction to cure said layers and provide said intermediate layer with substantially uniformly distributed voids of substantially uniform_size
'928_patent col._7,_l._61-- col._8,_l._15
21
a method of making a compressible_layer for use in a laminated printing *1347 blanket_construction comprising the steps of forming said compressible_layer of an elastomeric_material and mixing microcapsules with said elastomeric_material so that said microcapsules are substantially uniformly distributed therein maintaining said compressible_layer at a temperature below the melting_point of said microcapsules for a time sufficient to cause said elastomeric_material to vulcanize to a degree sufficient to substantially fix the positions of said microcapsules within said compressible_layer thereby providing a compressible_layer having a substantially uniform_thickness with said microcapsules being substantially uniformly distributed throughout said compressible_layer
'928_patent col._10,_ll._6-22

the main difference between the two asserted claims is that claim 1 recites the full two-step process for producing an entire printing_blanket whereas claim 21 focuses on the compressible_layer itself
for purposes of this appeal however the differences between the two claims are irrelevant because the disputed claim terms are identical in both claims

reeves_brothers inc.` reeves' manufactures compressible_printing_blankets using a method in which the compressible_layer is initially cured at conventional_vulcanization_temperatures
to avoid the agglomeration_problem of the prior_art_processes reeves uses high melting_point microspheres,3 or microcapsules which melt only at temperatures well above conventional vulcanizing temperatures
after the compressible_layer is vulcanized at approximately 280 degrees_f one or more layers are added to the compressible_layer and then the final blanket assembly is cured at approximately 285 degrees_f._day_int l slip op.at 10-11
it is undisputed that reeves has never cured the compressible_layer in its products at a temperature below 270 degrees_f

on june_8,_1999 day filed an infringement action against reeves in the united_states_district_court for the district of south_carolina alleging that reeves manufacturing process infringed claims 1_and_21 of the ¡¬928_patent
specifically day argued that reeves use of high melting_point microspheres to avoid the agglomeration of voids satisfied the limitation in the ¡¬928_patent that the compressible_layer be cured` at a temperature below the melting_point of [ the ] microcapsules'
reeves countered by arguing that the scope of the invention should be limited to processes which involve an initial curing step at` low_temperatures' namely at 110-170 degrees_f and filed a motion for summary_judgment of noninfringement on december 30 1999
essentially agreeing with the position taken by reeves the magistrate_judge granted summary_judgment of noninfringement in favor of reeves

*1348 a finding of noninfringement requires a two-step analytical approach
first the claims of the patent must be construed as a matter of law to determine their proper scope
see markman v. westview instruments inc. 52_f.3d_967 976 34_uspq2d_1321 1326 fed.cir.1995 affd 517_u.s._370 116_s.ct._1384 134_l.ed.2d_577 38_uspq2d_1461_(1996)
second a factual determination must be made as to whether the properly construed claims read on the accused product
see id
because questions regarding the construction of the claims are issues of law we review them without deference

a
at the center of the parties dispute is the meaning of the phrase` melting_point of said microcapsules' as it appears in the` maintaining' step found in both claims 1_and_21
the language of the` maintaining' step is shown below as it appears in claim 21:4

maintaining said compressible_layer at a temperature below the melting_point of said microcapsules for a time sufficient to cause said elastomeric_material to vulcanize to a degree sufficient to substantially fix the positions of said microcapsules within said compressible_layer ¡¬928_patent col._10,_ll._13-18
in both claims the phrase` melting_point of said microcapsules' appears without any explicit qualifications in terms of specific temperature ranges
day argues that` melting_point of said microcapsules' has a plain and clear meaning to one of ordinary_skill in the art rendering any reference to the written description unnecessary
while it is true that as a general rule the words of a patent claim are to be given their plain ordinary and accustomed meaning to one of ordinary_skill in the relevant art toro co. v. white consol
indus. inc. 199_f.3d_1295 1299 53_uspq2d_1065 1067 fed.cir.1999 a court must nevertheless examine the remaining intrinsic evidence to determine whether the patentee has set forth an explicit definition of a term contrary to its ordinary meaning has disclaimed subject_matter or has otherwise limited the scope of the claims
see scimed life sys. inc. v. adv
cardiovascular sys. inc. 242_f.3d_1337 1344 58_uspq2d_1059 1065 fed.cir.2001 ; biodex corp. v. loredan biomedical inc. 946_f.2d_850 862-63 20_uspq2d_1252 1262 fed.cir.1991

in this case the magistrate_judge found that arguments made by the patentee during the prosecution of the ¡¬928_patent limited the scope of the invention to processes which involve an initial curing at` low_temperatures' namely at 110-170 degrees_f._day_int l slip op.at 19
the judge identified several passages in the prosecution_history which led the court to conclude that the patentee` intentionally specified [ a curing step ] at a low temperature to differentiate its process from prior_art'
id
the relevant passages from the prosecution_history relate mainly to two prior_art references u.s. patent no._3700,541 issued to r.h. shrimpton et_al. on october 24 1972` shrimpton' and u.s._patent_no._4042,743 issued to charles e. larson et_al. on august 16 1977` larson'

like the ¡¬928_patent shrimpton discloses a printing_blanket containing a compressible_layer with voids formed by incorporating hollow thermoplastic microspheres *1349 i.e. microcapsules into the polymer prior to curing
shrimpton col._1,_ll._38-45
however unlike the ¡¬928_invention the curing of the compressible_layer in shrimpton does not take place at` low_temperatures' but at a conventional curing temperature 284 degrees_f._day_int l slip op.at 20
in distinguishing shrimpton the patentee stated that the invention solved a problem not addressed by shrimpton i.e. the agglomeration of voids by subjecting the compressible_layer` to a lower temperature namely 110 [ degrees ] f to 170 [ degrees ] f.' emphasis in original
furthermore the patentee argued that shrimpton disclosed` complete curing or vulcanization rather than a reduced temperature cure below the melting_point of the microcapsules'
( emphasis added
in a statement revealing what it regarded as the melting_point of the microcapsules the patentee stated that shrimptons conventional curing temperature of 284 degrees_f was` well above the melting_point of the microcapsules and therefore completely opposite of the [ claimed feature of ] claim 1'
the above statements indicate that the microcapsules the patentee contemplated were those that would melt at conventional curing temperatures and that the initial curing step in the ¡¬928_invention would take place at temperatures below conventional curing temperatures namely 110 degrees_f to 170 degrees_f

like shrimpton the larson reference also discloses a printing_blanket in which the compressible_layer is vulcanized at conventional_vulcanization_temperatures rather than at lower temperatures
day_int l slip op.at 20
more importantly larson also teaches the importance of using microballoons i.e. microcapsules that do not soften or melt during vulcanization
larson col._4,_ll._7-12
in light of these two specific teachings the patentees explicit statements that larson does not relate` to a low_temperature_vulcanization step' indicates that the initial curing contemplated by the ¡¬928_invention uses temperatures lower than those used in conventional vulcanization procedures

in addition to the above the patentees representations to the patent examiner that it had` discovered that the standard curing temperatures used in prior_art procedures such as those practiced by shrimpton and larson caused the microcapsules to melt' and its numerous references to a` low_temperature_cure' or` low_temperature_vulcanization' throughout the prosecution of the ¡¬928_patent all support the finding that the patentee had disavowed curing done at the higher conventional curing temperatures
therefore we conclude that the magistrate_judge did not err in light of the prosecution_history when it construed the` maintaining' step in claims 1_and_21 to require microcapsules that melted at conventional curing temperatures and when it concluded that the claims require an initial curing step that took place at temperatures below conventional curing temperatures

b
given the claim_construction above the second step of the infringement analysis is quite simple
to prove infringement day must show that every limitation in claim 1 or in claim 21 is met by reeves product either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents
see am permahedge inc. v. barcana inc. 105_f.3d_1441 1443 41_uspq2d_1614 1616 fed.cir.1997
there is no dispute that reeves uses expancel 091 microcapsules which have copolymer_shells that melt at approximately 330 degrees_f which is according to both parties`well above the 270 [ degrees ] f -- 280 [ degrees ] f vulcanization temperatures used to cure the compressible_layer'
there is also no dispute that reeves has never cured the compressible_layer in its printing_blankets at a temperature below 270 degrees_f. hence reeves processes *1350 do not practice the` maintaining' step in the ¡¬928_patent because reeves uses microcapsules that do not melt at conventional curing temperatures and additionally vulcanizes the compressible_layer in its printing_blankets at conventional curing temperatures
as such no literal_infringement can exist and the magistrate_judges finding on this point is affirmed

with respect to the magistrate_judges grant of summary_judgment of noninfringement under the doctrine of equivalents we conclude that days disavowal of the prior_art temperatures during the prosecution of the ¡¬928_patent constitutes prosecution_history estoppel and hence it should not be allowed to recapture subject_matter that it has previously surrendered
hilgraeve corp. v. mcafee assocs inc. 224_f.3d_1349 1355 55_uspq2d_1656 1661 fed.cir.2000` [ p ] rosecution history estoppel bars recapture of subject_matter surrendered during prosecution`
therefore the magistrate_judges finding that reeves processes do not infringe claims 1_and_21 of the ¡¬928_patent under the doctrine of equivalents is also affirmed

affirmed

this step is also referred to as a` low_temperature_vulcanization' or` low temperature vulcanizing step' in the ¡¬928_patent and will be treated as synonymous to a` low_temperature_cure'
