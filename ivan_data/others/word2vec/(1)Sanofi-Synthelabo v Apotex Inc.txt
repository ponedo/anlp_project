opinion
newman circuit_judge
this suit arose in accordance with the provisions of the hatch-waxman act codified at 35 u.s.c.¡± 271 e and 21 u.s.c.¡± 355 j
the patent at issue is united_states_patent_no._4847,265 the ¡¬265_patent owned by sanofi-synthelabo and related companies collectively` sanofi' and covers the pharmaceutical product having the common_name clopidogrel_bisulfate and the brand name plavixthe_r
the product has the property of inhibiting the aggregation of blood platelets and is used to treat or prevent blood-thrombotic events such as heart attacks and strokes
we affirm the district_courts ruling sustaining patent validity

background
clopidogrel is the common_name of the dextrorotatory_isomer of the chemical_compound named methyl_alpha-5 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro 3,2-c thienopyridyl 2-chlorophenyl -acetate
claim 3 of the patent is in suit 3
hydrogen sulfate of the dextro-rotatory_isomer of methyl_alpha-5 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro 3,2-c thienopyridyl 2-chlorophenyl -acetate substantially separated from the levo-rotatory_isomer
the ¡¬265_patent was issued on july_11,_1989 with priority from an application first filed in france in 1987
approval of the product by the united_states food and drug administration fda was received in 1998

*1078 apotex inc. filed an abbreviated new drug application anda 1 in november 2001 for fda_approval to sell clopidogrel_bisulfate stating pursuant to 21 u.s.c.¡± 355 j 2 a vii iv that it believed the ¡¬265_patent to be invalid
such` paragraph iv certification' is defined as an act of infringement for litigation purposes 35 u.s.c.¡± 271 e in order to facilitate pre-marketing legal challenge by the producer of a generic form of a patented pharmaceutical product
in accordance with the statutory procedures sanofi duly filed suit for infringement and apotex counterclaimed that the ¡¬265_patent is invalid on several grounds and unenforceable
the suit initiated a thirty-month stay of fda_approval of apotexs anda as provided by 21 u.s.c.¡± 355 j 5 b iii
a proposed settlement was not achieved the statutory stay expired the fda approved the apotex anda and apotex commenced sale of its generic clopidogrel_bisulfate product on august 8 2006
sanofi then moved in the district_court for a preliminary injunction asking that apotex be enjoined from marketing its infringing product while the litigation was pending noting that infringement was conceded by apotex

the district_court found that sanofi was likely to succeed on the merits of the validity and enforceability of the ¡¬265_patent and that the equitable factors of the balance of harms the probability of irreparable harm and the various public interests favored granting the injunction
sanofi-synthelabo v. apotex_inc. 488_f.supp.2d_317 350 s.d.n.y.2006` sanofi i`
this court affirmed the district_courts rulings while explaining that the record on the substantive issues was necessarily incomplete and that the district_court could review all aspects at trial
see sanofi-synthelabo v. apotex_inc. 470_f.3d_1368 1374-84 fed.cir.2006` sanofi ii` holding that the patentee was likely to succeed on the merits and that the balance of hardships and public interest supported the injunction
a bench_trial was held from january 22 to february 15 2007 following which the district_court ruled that the ¡¬265_patent is valid and enforceable
sanofi-synthelabo v. apotex_inc. 492_f.supp.2d_353 397 s.d.n.y.2007` sanofi_iii`

this appeal is focused on the question of patentability of this dextrorotatory_isomer in view of its known racemate described in earlier sanofi patents specifically sanofis united_states_patent_no._4529,596 the ¡¬596_patent and canadian patent no._1194,875 the ¡¬875_patent
both reference_patents are derived from the same french priority filing and are prior_art against the ¡¬265_patent

the activities that led to the product in suit are discussed in the earlier opinions and are summarized as relevant herein in 1972 sanofi_scientists were seeking products that might have improved anti-inflammatory properties and in the course of this work discovered that certain compounds of the class known as thienopyridines compounds having a thiene ring fused to a pyridine ring have the property of inhibiting blood platelet aggregation
sanofi_scientists led by dr. jean-pierre maffrand pursued this direction of research
the record states that they initially synthesized and evaluated several hundred chemical modifications and derivatives of thienopyridines seeking optimum anti-platelet aggregation properties with *1079 minimal undesirable effects
they eventually selected for development the compound having the following structural formula

?
sanofi gave this compound the common_name` ticlopidine'
after lengthy development including animal and human_trials in 1991 ticlopidine was approved in the united_states for use as an anti-thrombotic agent
this approval however was accompanied by required warnings concerning possible adverse effects for reports had been received of rarely occurring but serious blood disorders neutropenia and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura associated with prolonged usage of ticlopidine
thus sanofi continued its search for a product that would have the therapeutic benefits of ticlopidine but without the adverse properties
sanofi synthesized and evaluated several hundred additional thienopyridine derivatives including a class of compounds having the following general structure wherein one of the hydrogen_atoms on the bridge_carbon_atom marked with an asterisk is replaced with an ester carboxylic acid or amide group
this class is the subject of the ¡¬596_patent and the counterpart canadian ¡¬ 875 patent and is shown as follows

?
x and y can be any of a number of substituents as identified in the patents ; the district_court found that there are thirty-seven possibilities for x and 1710 choices for y
the patents state that compounds of this class exhibit good anti-platelet aggregation properties and are well tolerated
focusing on the ¡¬ 596 patent the specification includes twenty-one examples of specific compounds including a compound designated as pcr 4099 which sanofi synthesized in july 1980
in pcr 4099 the substituent attached to the bridge_carbon is the methyl ester group -cooch3 and x is chlorine in the 2-position as follows *1080. ?
this compound has the chemical name methyl_alpha-5 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro 3,2-c thieno pyridyl 2-chlorophenyl -acetate with the acronym mattpca
pcr 4099 as the hydrochloride_salt was selected for commercial_development as a potential replacement for ticlopidine in light of its improved platelet inhibition and toxicity profile
however pcr 4099 still raised toxicity concerns for at very high doses it caused convulsions in laboratory animals
thus the research efforts continued concurrently with the clinical and commercial_development of pcr 4099
sanofi states that about 1500 compounds in this general class were synthesized of which about 600 including pcr 4099 were chiral thienopyridines
`` chiral' is defined as` describ [ ing ] asymmetric molecules that are mirror images of each other i.e. they are related like right and left hands
such molecules are also called enantiomers and are characterized by optical activity'
richard j. lewis sr. hawleys condensed chemical dictionary 270 15th ed.2007

enantiomers are spatial isomers also called stereoisomers wherein the isomeric compounds have the same_chemical_formula and the same chemical structure but differ in their orientation in three-dimensional space
such stereoisomers can exist for all molecules that contain an asymmetric_carbon_atom
an` asymmetric_carbon' is a carbon_atom to which four different substituents are attached whereby due to the tetrahedral structure of carbon bonds in three dimensions the spatial_orientation of substituents attached to a carbon_atom varies
when there is only one asymmetric_carbon_atom in the molecule and thus only two stereoisomers these isomers are called enantiomers

enantiomers are identified and distinguished by their optical characteristics when a purified solution of the separated isomers is exposed to plane-polarized light
one enantiomer will rotate plane-polarized light to the right and thus is called the dextrorotatory or d- or + isomer and the other rotates plane-polarized light to the left called the levorotatory or l- or - isomer
for the compounds here at issue the asymmetric_carbon is at the bridge between the thienopyridine and the benzene components of the molecule as marked with an asterisk in the drawings shown ante
enantiomers generally are formed in equal amounts to produce what is called a racemate ; the racemate is optically neutral

in the district_court experts for both sides explained the difficulty of separating enantiomers for they are identical except for the spatial arrangement at one of the carbon_atoms
sanofi_scientists had previously separated the enantiomers of two thienopyridines and had found that the separated enantiomers showed no advantage over the racemates
the first such separation was conducted in 1978 for a *1081 compound designated pcr 1033 which had a methyl group in place of one of the hydrogen_atoms on the bridge_carbon of ticlopidine and whose maleate salt was found to be more potent than ticlopidine in antiplatelet_activity but had undesirable side effects
on separation it was found that one of the enantiomers of pcr 1033 was more biologically active but also more neurotoxic than the racemate
thus separation offered no benefit for pcr 1033

about three years later sanofi separated the enantiomers of a compound designated pcr 3233 which had an ethyl group on the bridge_carbon and was more effective in antiplatelet_activity than ticlopidine
however neither of the separated enantiomers differed in activity from the racemate and thus separation offered no benefit for pcr 3233
sanofi_witnesses testified to their belief that there was no advantage to separation of the enantiomers of thienopyridines and no other racemates were separated until in november 1985 dr. maffrand decided to study the enantiomers of pcr 4099

the separation for pcr 4099 was assigned to mr. alain badorc the chemist who had separated the enantiomers of pcr 1033_and_3233
it was explained in the district_court that such separations are complex and time-consuming for enantiomers are identical except for the spatial_orientation about one carbon_atom and tend to have identical or almost identical chemical and physical properties
the district_court received testimony that although the chemical literature shows at least ten separation techniques that might be tried it can not be known in advance which if any technique might work

the record shows five months of experimentation by mr._badorc and eventually the successful separation using a technique called diastereomeric salt formation
this procedure which originated with louis pasteur is based on the trial of diverse salt-forming compositions and conditions in the hope of coming upon a lucky combination of reagents that will preferentially select one of the enantiomers and crystallize from the solution in optically pure form
in mr._badorcs successful experiment he prepared thirty compositions of pcr 4099 and various resolving acids at various concentrations and in various solvents and after about one month crystals formed in the composition containing + camphorsulfonic acid and pcr 4099 in a 4:10 ratio dissolved in acetone
this combination eventually yielded the pure levorotatory_enantiomer and isolation of the pure dextrorotatory_enantiomer followed as discussed by the district_court in sanofi_iii 492 f.supp.2d at 372-73

sanofi then determined the biological_properties of the enantiomers of pcr 4099 and found that they had the rare characteristic of` absolute_stereoselectivity' the dextrorotatory_enantiomer provided all of the favorable_antiplatelet_activity but with no significant neurotoxicity while the levorotatory_enantiomer produced no antiplatelet_activity but virtually all of the neurotoxicity
the experts for both sides agreed that while it was generally known that enantiomers can exhibit different biological_activity this degree and kind of stereoselectivity is rare and could not have been predicted
the experts explained that in the usual case if one enantiomer is more biologically active than the other that activity includes the adverse as well as the beneficial properties

in view of these results in april 1987 sanofi terminated commercial_development of the racemate_pcr 4099 which had been proceeding since 1980 and had reached phase i human_trials at a cost stated to be tens of millions of dollars
more years of development ensued for the dextrorotatory_enantiomer to which sanofi gave the common *1082 name` clopidogrel'
sanofi also found that the hydrochloride_salt which had been suitable for processing and tabletting the racemate prc 4099 was not suitable for clopidogrel
after further_research sanofi found that the hydrogen sulfate salt also called the bisulfate was suitable for tabletting
fda_approval of clopidogrel_bisulfate was achieved in the united_states in 1998 allowing introduction of the product plavixthe_r

sanofi filed a patent application directed to clopidogrel and certain salts and pharmaceutical compositions in france on february 17 1987 and then in the united_states and other countries
the united_states patent is the ¡¬ 265 patent in suit
the ¡¬265 specification explains that the racemate of the same_chemical_formula was described in the earlier french ¡¬247_patent which corresponds to the earlier u.s. ¡¬596_patent
the ¡¬265_patent discusses the unusual stereoselectivity of the biological_properties as between the dextrorotatory and the levorotatory_enantiomers
the united_states patent examiner who had also examined the ¡¬596_patent allowed the claims after requiring that the ¡¬265 claims make clear that the dextro and levoenantiomers are` substantially separated'

apotex stipulated that claim 3 of the ¡¬265_patent is literally infringed by its product
the district_court after full trial including extensive expert testimony provided by both sides ruled that claim 3 is valid and enforceable
apotex appeals the courts rulings on the issues of anticipation and obviousness ; the rulings in sanofis favor on the issues of unenforceability and double patenting are not appealed

anticipation
claimed subject_matter is` anticipated' when it is not new ; that is when it was previously known
invalidation on this ground requires that every element and limitation of the claim was previously described in a single prior_art reference either expressly or inherently so as to place a person of ordinary_skill in possession of the invention
see schering corp. v. geneva pharms. inc. 339_f.3d_1373 1379 fed.cir.2003 ; continental can co. usa v. monsanto co. 948_f.2d_1264 1267-69 fed.cir.1991
an anticipating reference must be enabling ; that is the description must be such that a person of ordinary_skill in the field of the invention can practice the subject_matter based on the reference without undue_experimentation
see amgen_inc. v. hoechst_marion_roussel inc. 457_f.3d_1293 1306-07 fed.cir.2006 ; elan_pharms. inc. v. mayo found

educ
& research 346_f.3d_1051 1054 fed.cir.2003
anticipation is a question of fact and the district_courts finding of this issue is reviewed for clear_error
see merck & co. v. teva pharms
usa inc. 347_f.3d_1367 1369 fed.cir.2003

a
the district_court identified the limitations stated in claim 3 of the ¡¬265_patent as 1 the bisulfate_salt of 2 the dextrorotatory_enantiomer of 3 the compound mattpca 4 substantially separated from the levorotatory_enantiomer
the references on which apotex relied were the ¡¬ 596 patent or its canadian ¡¬875 counterpart
apotex argued that either reference not only shows the racemate_pcr 4099 but also its addition_salts and enantiomeric_forms
the district_court discussed that these references show pcr 4099 only as the racemate and do not show the separated enantiomer or the bisulfate_salt thereof
the district_court found that although the racemate is in the prior_art the dextrorotatory_enantiomer and salt in claim 3 of the ¡¬ 265 patent are *1083 not described either explicitly or inherently in any reference

the court heard expert_witnesses for both sides who agreed that persons of ordinary_skill in this field would have known that compounds that contain an asymmetric_carbon_atom have enantiomers
the ¡¬596 specification states` these compounds having an asymmetrical carbon may exist in the form of two enantiomers
the invention relates both to each enantiomer and their mixture'
¡¬596_patent col. 1 lines 39-41
however as the witnesses agreed all of the compounds in the ¡¬596_patent are racemates and neither the twenty-one specific examples nor any other part of the specification shows their separation into enantiomers
the district_court reasoned that a person of ordinary_skill in the field of the invention would not have been guided to either the dextrorotatory_enantiomer of pcr 4099 or its bisulfate_salt

apotex argues that the district_court erred in law and that it suffices that the reference shows the specific racemate_pcr 4099 and states that the compounds in the reference have enantiomers and that the enantiomers are included in the invention
apotex states that the separation of enantiomers is routine even if time-consuming or requiring some experimentation and thus that that the separation need not have been performed or described in the reference
apotex states that the properties of the enantiomers of pcr 4099 are inherently and necessarily present in its known racemate such that when the enantiomers are separated the previously observed properties are` immediately recognized' in one or the other enantiomer

apotex stresses that the ¡¬596_patents example 1 is specific to pcr 4099 and the ¡¬596 claims refer to` addition_salts with pharmaceutically acceptable mineral or organic acids' and` both enantiomeric_forms or their mixture'
the counterpart canadian ¡¬875_patent states that when the desired structure is obtained it` is isolated and if desired its enantiomers are separated and/or it is salified by mineral or organic acid action'
apotex concedes that the references do not show any separated enantiomers or describe how to separate them but argues that such detail is not required because persons of ordinary_skill would know the existing techniques for separating enantiomers

apotex thus argues that the dextrorotatory_enantiomer of mattpca can not be deemed novel as a matter of law
however as the district_court recognized that is not the correct view of the law of anticipation which requires the specific description as well as enablement of the subject_matter at issue
to anticipate the reference` must not only disclose all elements of the claim within the four corners of the document but must also disclose those elementsarranged as in the claim
`` net moneyin inc. v. verisign inc. 545_f.3d_1359 1369 fed.cir.2008 quoting connell v. sears roebuck & co. 722_f.2d_1542 1548 fed.cir.1983 ; see also e.g. in re arkley 59_c.c.p.a._804 455_f.2d_586 587 1972` [ the ] reference must clearly and unequivocally disclose the claimed [ invention ] or direct those skilled in the art to the [ invention ] without any need for picking choosing and combining various disclosures not directly related to each other by the teachings of the cited reference' emphasis in original

the district_court analyzed the question as whether a generic_disclosure necessarily anticipates everything within the genus and recognized that the answer depends on the factual aspects of the specific disclosure and the particular products at issue
see e.g. atofina v. great lakes chem corp. 441_f.3d_991 999 fed.cir.2006` it *1084 is well established that the disclosure of a genus in the prior_art is not necessarily a disclosure of every species that is a member of that genus`
in in re ruschig 52_c.c.p.a._1238 343_f.2d_965 974 1965 the court declined to find the disclosed genus anticipatory of everything within its scope when the description of the genus would not lead a person of ordinary_skill to a` small recognizable class with common properties'
in this case the district_court correctly declined to find that the references general_statements that these compounds consist of enantiomers constituted an anticipating_disclosure of the separated dextrorotatory_enantiomer of pcr 4099

the district_court discussed the cases on which apotex particularly relied in re petering 49_c.c.p.a._993 301_f.2d_676_(1962) and in re schaumann 572_f.2d_312_(ccpa_1978)
the court pointed out that in petering and schaumann the generic_disclosure in the reference identified` specific preferences' which were met by the later-described species
we discern no clear_error in the district_courts finding that the references herein contained no such specific preferences
pcr 4099 is shown in the references as one of several compounds with desirable biological_properties but the district_court did not clearly err in finding that the reference disclosure would not have led one of ordinary_skill to recognize either an explicit or an inherent disclosure of its dextrorotatory_enantiomer as well as the bisulfate_salt

apotex also relies on in re_adamson 47_c.c.p.a._839 275_f.2d_952_(1960) where the court held that although the reference did not state that the disclosed compound was a racemate it would have been known to one of ordinary_skill that synthetically produced chiral compounds are racemic
sanofi does not dispute this statement of stereochemistry but points out that knowledge of the existence of enantiomers is not a description of a specific_enantiomer` substantially separated' from the other as in claim 3 of the ¡¬265_patent
the district_court cited in re may 574_f.2d_1082_(ccpa_1978) which is explicit that` the novelty of an optical isomer is not negated by the prior_art disclosure of its racemate'
id.at 1090
also adamson and may were addressing rejections for obviousness and neither case stated or suggested a previously unseparated and unknown enantiomer might be deemed anticipated by the known racemate

the district_court did not clearly err in finding that the statements in the ¡¬ 596 patent and its canadian_counterpart that the products therein consist of enantiomers are not a description of the specific dextrorotatory_enantiomer clopidogrel or a suggestion of its unusual stereospecific properties
the knowledge that enantiomers may be separated is not` anticipation' of a specific_enantiomer that has not been separated identified and characterized
the district_court correctly held that neither the ¡¬596_patent nor its canadian_counterpart contains an anticipating_disclosure of the subject_matter of claim 3 of the ¡¬265_patent

b
the parties also debated the question of enablement with respect to anticipation
the district_court found that the asserted references are not enabling for they contain no guidance as to how to separate the enantiomers of pcr 4099
based on the evidence adduced at trial the court concluded that absent such guidance undue_experimentation would be required

apotex argues that it is entitled to a presumption of enablement because the asserted references are patents which are presumed to be enabling because they are presumed valid citing *1085 amgen_inc. v. hoechst_marion_roussel inc. 314_f.3d_1313 1355 fed.cir.2003` we hold that an accused infringer should be similarly entitled to have the district_court presume the enablement of unclaimed and claimed material in a prior_art patent defendant asserts against a plaintiff`
apotex argues that the presumption should be particularly strong here because the prior_art_patents belong to sanofi
thus apotex argues that the general_statements in the reference_patents concerning enantiomers are presumptively enabling of the separate_enantiomers of pcr 4099
apotex states that it is irrelevant whether the separation of this specific_enantiomer is shown in the references because a person of ordinary_skill in this field would know all of the existing techniques for separating stereoisomers and would presumptively succeed in this particular separation
apotex points out that the method that was eventually used by sanofi was a well-known method even if it involved some experimentation

any presumption of enablement of prior_art does not exclude consideration of whether undue_experimentation would be required to achieve enablement
see e.g. elan_pharms 346 f.3d at 1054 the reference must teach how to carry out the invention without undue_experimentation
the factors relevant to whether experimentation is undue are discussed in e.g. in re wands 858_f.2d_731 737 fed.cir.1988 and include the quantity of experimentation that was actually needed the amount of guidance provided in the reference the presence or absence of actual examples of the experimental procedure the state of the knowledge already available concerning the subject_matter at issue and the predictability or unpredictability in the specific area of science or technology
the ¡¬596_patent reference states only that` if desired its enantiomers are separated' and similarly for the canadian_counterpart
the district_court found that these references contain no description of how to separate the enantiomers of pcr 4099 and that` [ d ] iscovering which method and what combination of variables is required is sufficiently arduous and uncertain as to require undue_experimentation even by one skilled in the relevant art'
sanofi_iii 492 f.supp.2d at 387
this finding has not been shown to be clearly erroneous
in forest_laboratories inc. v. ivax pharmaceuticals inc. 501_f.3d_1263_(fed.cir.2007) this court recognized the known difficulty of separating enantiomers and the unpredictability of their properties and held that a reference that stated that a compound has enantiomers did not enable the separation of those enantiomers where the reference did not teach how to obtain the enantiomer
id.at 1268-69
we discern no clear_error in the district_courts finding herein that the reference_patents would not have enabled a person of ordinary_skill to obtain clopidogrel substantially separated from the levorotatory_enantiomer

the district_courts ruling that claim 3 of the ¡¬265_patent is not invalid for anticipation is affirmed

obviousness
the determination of obviousness is a matter of law based on findings of underlying fact wherein the factors identified in graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966) guide the inquiry under ¡± 103 the scope and content of the prior_art are to be determined ; differences between the prior_art and the claims at issue are to be ascertained ; and the level of ordinary_skill in the pertinent art resolved
against this background the obviousness or nonobviousness of the subject_matter is determined
such secondary considerations *1086 as commercial success long felt but unsolved needs failure of others etc. might be utilized to give light to the circumstances surrounding the origin of the subject_matter sought to be patented
id.at 17-18 86_s.ct._684

the determination of obviousness is made with respect to the subject_matter as a whole not separate pieces of the claim
see ksr int l co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 127_s.ct._1727 1734 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007) ; kimberly-clark corp. v. johnson & johnson 745_f.2d_1437 1448 fed.cir.1984
for chemical_compounds the structure of the compound and its properties are inseparable considerations in the obviousness determination
see in re sullivan 498_f.3d_1345 1353 fed.cir.2007 ; in re papesch 50_c.c.p.a._1084 315_f.2d_381 391 1963
precedent establishes the analytical procedure whereby a close structural similarity between a new chemical_compound and prior_art compounds is generally deemed to create a prima_facie_case of obviousness shifting to the patentee the burden of coming forward with evidence of nonobviousness
the evidence may take various forms as relevant in the particular case
see e.g. takeda chem industries ltd. v. alphapharm pty. ltd. 492_f.3d_1350 1358 1362-63 fed.cir.2007 prima_facie_case depends on whether the prior_art provided a suggestion or reason to choose a specific lead compound for modification or to make the specific modification of the compound at issue ; eisai co. v. dr. reddys labs. ltd. 533_f.3d_1353 1359 fed.cir.2008 same
the ultimate determination is made in the context of the graham_factors with the challenger having the ultimate burden of proving invalidity by clear and convincing_evidence
see pfizer inc. v. apotex inc. 480_f.3d_1348 1360 fed.cir.2007

the district_court assumed that apotex had made a prima_facie_case of obviousness based on the reference_patents disclosure of the pcr 4099 racemate the statements in the patents concerning enantiomers and the general_knowledge that enantiomers may be separated and may differ from each other in biological_properties
upon consideration of the graham_factors the court held that the unpredictable and unusual properties of the dextrorotatory_enantiomer and the therapeutic advantages thereby provided weighed in favor of nonobviousness and that apotex had not met its burden of establishing otherwise

apotex argues that the recognition in the prior_art that pcr 4099 is composed of enantiomers outweighs the effect of any unexpected or unpredictable_properties of the separated dextrorotatory_enantiomer
apotex asserts that sanofis previous selection of pcr 4099 as a promising replacement for ticlopidine would have led a skilled artisan to start with pcr 4099 as a lead compound for further_research
apotex states that it was well known that enantiomers can have different_levels of biological_activity even if the exact allocation of properties is unpredictable thereby rendering it obvious to separate the enantiomers and determine their properties
apotex contends that the only features of clopidogrel_bisulfate arguably not explicit in the prior_art-the separation of the dextrofrom the levorotatory_enantiomer and its preparation as a bisulfate_salt-required no more than well-known chemical techniques
apotex cites known examples of other chiral compounds that exhibit stereoselectivity and argues that the general_knowledge that a favorable_allocation of properties is possible suffices to render the separation obvious to a person of ordinary_skill

*1087 apotex thus argues that there was motivation to separate the enantiomers of pcr 4099 and that a person of ordinary_skill in the field would have been able to do so using known procedures even if some experimentation was required and then upon separation of the enantiomers routine testing would have revealed the favorable_allocation of properties in the dextrorotatory_isomer
apotex asserts that it is not material that this allocation was unknown in advance and unpredictable and that what matters is whether a person of ordinary_skill would have had a reasonable_probability of success in the separation and evaluation of the enantiomer citing pfizer 480 f.3d at 1364 wherein this court observed that` case law is clear that obviousness can not be avoided simply by a showing of some degree of unpredictability in the art so long as there was a reasonable_probability of success'

sanofi responds by challenging apotexs view of the law and citing the evidence on the factual premises of these arguments
at trial the expert_witnesses for both sides agreed that a person of ordinary_skill in this field in the mid-1980s would have known that enantiomers can exhibit different biological activities
however the experts also agreed that it was not predictable whether such differences if any would be weak moderate or strong or how they would be manifested
the experts agreed that no known scientific principle allows prediction of the degree to which stereoisomers will exhibit different_levels of therapeutic activity and toxicity
the experts agreed that weak stereoselectivity of biological_properties is more common than strong stereoselectivity and that absolute_stereoselectivity is rare
sanofi_witnesses testified as to the research teams belief based on the earlier separations of two other_thienopyridines that separation of enantiomers was unlikely to be productive
apotexs expert when asked whether one could predict in advance the therapeutic and toxic properties of the enantiomers stated` no
i certainly do n't believe you could predict that without separating them and trying it
i ca n't imagine anybody presuming anything else'
the experts also agreed that activity and toxicity were more likely to be positively correlated such that a reduction in toxicity would be expected also to reduce the beneficial activity
witnesses also explained that it was known that for compounds whose biological_activity is delivered through metabolism within the body the acid environment in the stomach or other metabolic processes often restores the racemic state thereby removing any potential benefit of a separated enantiomer
on the basis of this trial_evidence the district_court found that a person of ordinary_skill in this field would not reasonably have predicted that the dextrorotatory_enantiomer would provide all of the antiplatelet_activity and none of the adverse neurotoxicity
clear error has not been shown in this finding and in the conclusion of nonobviousness based thereon
see papesch 315 f.2d at 391 a chemical_compound and its properties are inseparable

the district_court also discussed the evidence concerning the process of separating the enantiomers of pcr 4099
apotex argued that sanofis separation procedure was well known and therefore that the separated components of the known racemate were obvious as a matter of law whether or not they were deemed to have unexpected properties
the district_court observed that in 1987 there were at least ten techniques that had been used to separate_enantiomers and that they all required experimentation to determine whether they could be successful for a particular compound including choices of reagents solvents concentrations temperature and a variety of other conditions
*1088 the court observed that pasteurs diastereomeric salt formation technique had long been described in chemistry textbooks but that the textbooks also explain that the method is difficult and that there is no` infallible recipe' for obtaining separation

the district_court referred to the testimony of sanofis expert dr. stephen g. davies who stated in discussing the diastereomeric_salt_formation_method that it is difficult indeed to cause one enantiomer to crystallize out of solution while the other does not
as discussed ante in connection with anticipation mr._badorcs eventual success came only after several failures using other known strategies for enantiomer separation
the court observed that although sanofi had previously separated the enantiomers of two other_thienopyridines the diastereomeric_salt_formation_method had succeeded in one case but failed in the other
the court also found that a person of ordinary_skill would have recognized that it could be more difficult to separate the enantiomers of pcr 4099 than the two other compounds that mr._badorc had previously separated because it would be understood by chemists that the methyl ester substituent in pcr 4099 could make it more susceptible to re-racemization and thus resistant to successfully obtaining a separated product

the district_court found that this separation was not a simple or routine procedure and that success in separation as well as the allocation of properties was unpredictable
the court observed that apotex did not cite any reference showing or suggesting any reliable method of separation for any analogous compounds
the court described the separation as a` paradigm of trial and error' sanofi_iii 492 f.supp.2d at 370 and found that` neither the chemists at sanofi nor a person of ordinary_skill in the art could have reasonably expected that the separate_enantiomers of pcr 4099 could be obtained at the time that sanofi was contemplating whether to investigate them and if obtained they could not have predicted by what method and configuration'
id.at 371
the court found that sanofis expenditure of tens of millions of dollars for several years of development of the racemate_pcr 4099 before separating the enantiomers also weighed against finding that separation would have been obvious
again apotex has demonstrated no clear_error in the extensive finding of the district_court concerning the difficulty and unpredictability of the separation of these enantiomers
these unchallenged findings undermine apotexs argument in this appeal that the separation of the enantiomers would have been obvious
only with hindsight knowledge that the dextrorotatory_enantiomer has highly desirable properties can apotex argue that it would have been obvious to select this particular racemate and undertake its arduous separation
the application of hindsight is inappropriate where the prior_art does not suggest that this enantiomer could reasonably be expected to manifest the properties and advantages that were found for this particular dextrorotatory_isomer
see graham 383 u.s. at 36 86_s.ct._684 cautioning against hindsight whereby the teachings of the invention are read into the prior_art ; see also ksr v. teleflex 127 s.ct.at 1742 recognizing` hindsight bias' and` ex post reasoning' as inappropriate in determination of obviousness

concerning the bisulfate_salt the district_court found no evidentiary support for apotexs argument that the ¡¬596_patent taught the dextrorotatory_enantiomer of pcr 4099 as the bisulfate_salt
the pcr 4099 racemate is shown in the ¡¬596_patent as the hydrochloride not the bisulfate
the district_court observed that the scientific literature listed eighty acids as candidates for forming salts with basic drug *1089 compounds fifty-three of which acids had been used in fda-approved drugs
the experts of both parties agreed that whether a pharmaceutically suitable crystalline salt will form from a particular acid-base combination is unpredictable
the district_court distinguished the facts of this case from those of pfizer 480_f.3d_1348 where there was evidence that based on the prior_art a person of ordinary_skill would have narrowed the possible salts to only a few including the claimed besylate whereas here sanofi presented evidence that the prior_art taught away from the use of sulfuric acid with an enantiomer for strong acids could encourage re-racemization
apotex has shown no clear_error in the district_courts finding based on the trial_evidence that the facts distinguish this case from those in pfizer

based on all of these findings the district_court concluded` whether or not it may have beenobvious to try separating the enantiomers of pcr 4099 and secondarily preparing its dextrorotatory_enantiomer as a bisulfate_salt the wide range of possible outcomes and the relative unlikelihood that the resulting compound would exhibit the maximal increase in antiplatelet aggregation activity and the absence of neurotoxicity makes clopidogrel_bisulfate non-obvious'
sanofi_iii 492 f.supp.2d at 392
apotex argues that the district_court applied an incorrect inquiry and that the correct inquiry is not whether the results obtained with the separated enantiomer were unexpected but whether it would have been obvious to separate and test the enantiomers based on the general_knowledge that enantiomers can exhibit different_properties
apotex refers to in re_adamson 275 f.2d at 955 where the ccpa held that an enantiomer would have been obvious in view of its racemate
however the scientific facts differed from these herein for in adamson the court found that it was` particularly expected' that the specific_enantiomer would have the observed properties
in contrast as sanofi points out in in re may 574 f.2d at 1095 the ccpa held as to the enantiomer claimed therein that the appellant` established a substantial record of unpredictability vis-a-vis a highly significant combination of properties'

the determination of obviousness is dependent on the facts of each case
see graham 383 u.s. at 17-18 86_s.ct._684
in forest_laboratories 501 f.3d at 1269 this court affirmed that the + enantiomer of citalopram would not have been obvious in light of the known racemate when it was shown that the therapeutic properties of the + enantiomer were unexpected
in contrast in aventis pharma deutschland gmbh v. lupin ltd. 499_f.3d_1293 1302 fed.cir.2007 this court held that the ramipril isomers potency was` precisely what one would expect as compared to a mixture containing other inert or near-inert stereoisomers'
apotex argues that aventis is the closer analogy but the evidence was directly contrary to that position
the district_court entered extensive findings in this case on the unexpected and unpredictable_properties of clopidogrel and there was no contrary evidence suggesting based on the prior_art that the stereoselective properties were` precisely what one would expect' as in aventis

apotex also argued in the district_court and repeats on this appeal that sanofi separated the enantiomers only because of a possible_future_regulatory_requirement concerning the separation of enantiomers
apotex states that this future regulatory requirement would have alerted a person of ordinary_skill to the need to separate isomers and thus would have rendered it obvious to do so
the district_court found that the sole evidence referring to this regulatory possibility an internal sanofi memorandum was written *1090 several months after sanofi had discontinued its development of the racemic pcr 4099 in favor of the dextrorotatory_enantiomer ; the court also cited the testimony and documentary evidence that sanofi undertook this separation in order to study the adverse neurological effects of pcr 4099 and not because of a possible_future_regulatory_requirement
sanofi also points out as the general_knowledge in this field confirms that the recognition that stereoisomers may exhibit different_properties does not teach which results may ensue or how to separate any given enantiomers
we discern no error in the short shrift that the district_court gave to this argument

apotex also argues that the district_court did not take adequate account of the supreme courts holding in ksr v. teleflex that the` combination of familiar_elements according to known methods is likely to be obvious when it does no more than yield predictable results'
127 s.ct.at 1739
apotex states that sanofi did no more than separate the enantiomers and determine their properties and that the properties were predictably those of the racemate allocated between the enantiomers
sanofi points out that this case does not concern a` combination of familiar_elements' as in the ksr mechanical device made by combining known components to produce a combination having the properties of the known components
the evidence at trial well supported the finding that the result of this separation of enantiomers was unpredictable
we discern no error in the district_courts implicit recognition that the principles of ksr do not affect the conclusion herein

the district_court thoroughly discussed the many issues and arguments raised by apotex
we discern no error in the district_courts findings that on the state of the prior_art a person of ordinary_skill would not have had the expectation that separating the enantiomers would be likely to produce an isomer having absolute_stereoselectivity as to both the favorable_antiplatelet_activity and the unfavorable neurotoxicity
the totality of these findings and the correct application of law well support the district_courts conclusion that invalidity had not been established by clear and convincing_evidence
