background
a
the invention
the ¡¬405_patent is entitled` post-mix beverage dispenser with an associated simulated display of beverage'
figure 1 of the patent depicts a beverage_dispenser embodying the claimed invention showing the countertop display_bowl with its auxiliary equipment located below the counter and concealed from public view

?
as set forth in more detail in a previous appeal involving this suit a` post-mix' beverage_dispenser stores beverage syrup_concentrate and water in separate locations until the beverage is ready to be dispensed
see juicy_whip inc. v. *732 orange_bang inc. 185_f.3d_1364 1365 51_uspq2d_1700 1701 fed.cir.1999` juicy_whip i`
the syrup and water are mixed together immediately before the beverage is dispensed which is usually after the consumer requests the beverage
in contrast in a` pre-mix' beverage_dispenser the syrup_concentrate and water are pre-mixed and the beverage is stored in a display reservoir bowl until it is ready to be dispensed
the display_bowl is said to stimulate impulse buying by providing the consumer with a visual beverage display
a pre-mix display_bowl however has a limited capacity and is subject to contamination by bacteria
it therefore must be refilled and cleaned frequently

the invention claimed in the ¡¬405_patent is a post-mix beverage_dispenser that is designed to look like a pre-mix beverage_dispenser
the claims require the post-mix dispenser to have a transparent bowl that is filled with a fluid that simulates the appearance of the dispensed_beverage and is resistant to bacterial growth
the claims also require that the dispenser create the visual_impression that the bowl is the principal_source of the dispensed_beverage although in fact the beverage is mixed immediately before it is dispensed as in conventional post-mix dispensers

the two claims at issue claims 6_and_9 provide 6
a method for inducing sales of a beverage to be dispensed from the outlet of a post-mix beverage_dispenser said method comprising the steps of positioning a transparent_display_bowl relative to the dispenser outlet to create the visual_impression that said bowl is the reservoir and principal_source from which a serving of the beverage is dispensed ; selecting a display fluid for said bowl which resists formation of organic_growth and simulates the appearance of the dispensed_beverage ; and
visibly storing without dispensing a quantity of said fluid in said bowl to create the visual_impression that multiple_servings of the dispensed_beverage are stored in said bowl for issuance from the outlet
9
a beverage dispensing apparatus comprising a post-mix dispenser having a dispensing outlet for discharging beverage components in predetermined proportions to provide a serving of dispensed_beverage ; and
a transparent display container having no fluid connection with said outlet and visibly containing a quantity of fluid which simulates the appearance of said dispensed_beverage said fluid being resistant to organic_growth ; said container being positioned relative to said outlet to create the visual_impression that said container is the reservoir and principal_source of said dispensed_beverage issuing from said outlet ; and
said container and said quantity of fluid visible within said container cooperating to create the visual_impression that multiple_servings of said dispensed_beverage are stored within said container

b
the prosecution history
the first of five applications leading to the ¡¬405_patent was filed at the united states patent and trademark office` pto' on september 1 1989
throughout the prosecution history the examiner rejected the invention as obvious over the prior_art
to overcome these rejections the inventors peter k. stratton and gus j. stratton submitted among other *733 things declarations from participants in the beverage industry directed toward the novelty commercial_success and long-felt need of the patented_invention
among the declarations were one from greg_boulahanis a former_employee of an orange_bang_distributor owned by the strattons and another from joe w. bowers jr. a former coca-cola company employee who later joined juicy_whip
those two declarations became part of the focus of orange_bangs inequitable_conduct_defense

1
the greg_boulahanis declaration
the boulahanis_declaration was first submitted on october 31 1990 as one of three declarations directed to the advantages of the patented_invention and the problems with the prior_art
the boulahanis_declaration states that he` worked for a distributor of orange_bang' and was responsible for servicing maintaining and repairing pre-mix dispensers
he explained his experiences and the difficulties of cleaning and maintaining pre-mix dispensers
specifically he noted that some retailers were reluctant to clean the bowls thoroughly and those who did often damaged the machines while cleaning them
he then described how he unsuccessfully tried to solve the problems associated with the pre-mix dispensers
he concluded by saying that no one in the industry solved those problems until juicy_whip introduced its post-mix tower max ii dispenser to the market

after the submission of the declaration to the pto the examiner responded [ t ] he declaration of greg_boulahanis has been considered
the declaration states affiant was an employee of a competitor of the company owning the rights to the instant_invention
affiant alleges the existing technology required the disadvantage of cleaning and although attempted could not be overcome in a manner acceptable to the industry until the appearance of the instant_invention on the market which rendered unnecessary such cleaning and dis-assembly
affiant fails to show a nexus between the problems of prior_art_dispensers and the emergence of the instant_invention into the market thus the declaration lacks probative value

the examiner understood that boulahanis was` an employee of a competitor of the company owning the rights to the instant_invention'
boulahanis actually worked for a company called omega_beverage a company owned by the strattons before they founded juicy_whip
omega_beverage was an orange_bang_distributor at the time that boulahanis worked there
thus boulahaniss statement that he` worked for a distributor of orange_bang' was true
despite the submission of the boulahanis_declaration the examiner continued to reject the strattons claims as obvious over the prior_art
the strattons re-submitted the boulahanis_declaration two more times during the prosecution of the applications leading to the ¡¬405_patent once on february 29 1991 and again on may_2,_1995
both times they did not correct the examiners apparent misunderstanding of the competitive posture of boulahaniss employer

2
the joe bowers declaration
the bowers_declaration was submitted to the pto in december 1994
at that time bowers was an employee of coca-cola usa all coca-cola entities are herein referred to as` coca cola'
prior to bowers declaration coca-cola and juicy_whip had entered into an agreement setting forth the terms and conditions of the purchase by coca-cola of 10,000 juicy_whip machines over a five-year period
the agreement was subject to termination *734 if juicy_whip abandoned the pending patent application

the bowers_declaration states that in his capacity as the manager of the innovation center with coca-cola he read about juicy_whips new tower max dispenser investigated the product and arranged for the installation of fifty machines to be serviced by coca-cola
bowers described the problems of the prior_art machines and the difficulties associated with cleaning them
bowers praised the juicy_whip product saying that the` tower max dispenser provided an important advance in fountain dispensing technology that would render conventional pre-mix storage display dispensers or bubblers obsolete'
the declaration concludes by noting` it would be absurd for any retailer of fountain beverages not to use the [ juicy_whip_dispenser ] in preference to any bubbler now available'

after the bowers_declaration was filed coca-cola despite its earlier business relationship with juicy_whip filed a protest before the pto under 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.291 a against the issuance of the ¡¬405_patent
in that protest coca-cola argued that some statements in the bowers_declaration were not true and that the invention was obvious
for example while bowers stated in his declaration that the juicy_whip_dispenser` solved the display_bowl cleaning problem that had confronted coca-cola for more than 10 years' the protest contained a declaration from coca-colas manager of postmix sales equipment who declared that coca-cola technical personnel had not been asked to solve the cleaning problem and if they had been they would have solved it
the examiner rejected the coca-cola_protest noting that the bowers_declaration was given little weight
furthermore the examiner found that` [ d ] espite [ coca-colas ] contention that the commercial_success in the bowers jr. declaration is untrue the body of evidence in the file history of this application and [ coca-colas ] own comments acknowledging commercial_success.. demonstrate commercial_success which weighed in the patentability decision..' the ¡¬405_patent eventually issued on november 19 1996

c. procedural history
the case was tried to a jury following a remand from this court
juicy_whip i 185 f.3d at 1365 51 uspq2d at 1701
at trial orange_bang presented evidence that the patented_invention was in public_use more than one year prior to the filing of the application that led to the ¡¬405_patent
specifically it contended that defendant_orange_bangs owner and co-defendant david_fox made and sold two different types of anticipatory_beverage_dispensers-one around 1983` the 1983 dispenser' and the other in 1988` the 1988 dispenser'

as to the 1983 dispenser it was contended that fox converted a pre-mix dispenser into a post-mix dispenser by removing the pre-mix nozzle plugging the remaining hole and installing a post-mix valve arrangement in the base of the pre-mix dispenser
it was further argued that the following_year fox shipped two of the converted dispensers to two orange_bang_distributors-roller beverage in houston texas and energy_beverage in new_york_city
mr. patrick goff a salesperson for jet_spray inc. a beverage_dispenser manufacturer testified that sometime between spring 1983 and summer 1984 he observed and operated a` retrofitted' beverage_dispenser at the houston_distributorship
defendant_bruce_burwick co-owner of unique beverage with fox and sole owner of energy_beverage testified that he placed the 1983 dispenser with a customer who was operating the food and *735 beverage concession at the staten island zoo in new_york_city
the customer mr. frank_cretella testified that he used what he called the` makeshift' or` conversion' beverage_dispenser in april 1984 but stopped using it after one month because the beverage was not refrigerated

in addition to the evidence concerning the 1983 dispenser orange_bang presented evidence to suggest that in 1988 fox created another anticipatory device
instead of taking a pre-mix dispenser and converting it to a post-mix dispenser the 1988 dispenser was a post-mix dispenser with a clear_bowl placed on top of it
it was argued that orange_bang purchased these bowls from a mr. john massaro the senior_salesperson at an orange_bang supplier
massaro testified that he first sold acrylic_bowls to orange_bang in late 1987_or_1988
fox allegedly shipped some of these 1988 dispensers to burwick at the new_york_city distributor energy_beverage who in turn placed the units with cretella
cretella at that time operated the boathouse restaurant in new_york_city
cretella testified that he used the` modified tower' dispenser from may 1988 through the july 4th weekend of that year
cretella had the dispenser removed after the bowl leaked all over his countertop

orange_bang further presented the testimony of another witness mr. richard stein orange_bangs operations_manager
stein testified that in 1984 he saw fox in the orange_bang service department with a post-mix dispenser base connected to a pre-mix dispenser
stein further testified that in spring of 1988 he and fox met with massaro to discuss the bowls to be used for the 1988 dispensers

in total six witnesses testified that they either saw or used the allegedly anticipatory_beverage_dispensers
the evidence also included sketches of the 1983 dispenser drawn by goff and cretella during their depositions for this case and a purchase_order for the acrylic_bowls used in the 1988 dispenser

with regard to inequitable_conduct orange_bang focused on the bowers and boulahanis_declarations and on a march_11,_1988 letter drafted by gus_stratton and addressed to the california_department of health_services
the letter indicates that it is a follow-up to a phone conversation with a department of health_services employee regarding a`fountain type beverage_dispenser with a clear_bowl display above'
stratton expressed a concern that the department would have an objection to the dispenser because of potential consumer confusion
the letter says that a disclaimer sticker will be placed on the bowl indicating that the liquid in the clear_bowl is` for advertising purposes only' and includes a sketch of a dispenser
at trial juicy_whip produced the original letter and gus_stratton testified that he never mailed it
stratton had testified at his deposition that he had mailed it but he retracted that statement after remembering that the department called him to tell him that he should contact a different agency
stratton never provided the pto with a copy of the letter

the district_court submitted the issue of inequitable_conduct to the jury asking them the following questions 7
did defendants prove by clear and convincing_evidence that the strattons obtained the ¡¬405_patent by withholding material_information from the patent_office ?
8
did defendants prove by clear and convincing_evidence that the strattons withheld material_information from the patent_office with the intent to mislead the patent_examiner ?
9
if your answer to question 7 is yes and your answer to question 8 is yes weighing all of the circumstances *736 did defendants prove by clear and convincing_evidence that the strattons engaged in inequitable_conduct in the patent application process so that the patent should be invalidated ?

in a special_verdict the jury answered each question in the affirmative
following trial juicy_whip argued that the jurys decision was not binding as it was an issue for the district_court to decide
the district_court concluded based on the parties representations in court and their submission of jury instructions on the issue that the parties agreed to have the jury decide the inequitable_conduct_issue
the district judge noted that` the court would not have instructed the jury on weighing or included question 9 on the verdict form if it had been the courts intent to reserve the final decision on whether inequitable_conduct justified invalidating the patent for itself'
because the district_court believed that the jurys verdict was binding it did not issue a separate decision on inequitable_conduct

the special_verdict also included findings that 1 claims 6_and_9 of the ¡¬405_patent are invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b based on prior_public_use ; 2 defendants orange_bang inc. and unique_beverage_dispensers inc. willfully infringed and induced infringement of claims 6_and_9 of the ¡¬ 405 patent ; and 3 defendant owners david_fox and bruce_burwick did not induce infringement of the claims
in response to motions for judgment as a matter of law` jmol' under rule 50 a of the federal rules of civil procedure or alternatively a new_trial under rule 59 b the district_court upheld the entire jury verdict

juicy_whip appeals the district_courts denial of its motions for jmol and for a new_trial on the issues of invalidity based on prior_public_use and inequitable_conduct and the district_courts awarding of costs to the defendant
neither party appeals any of the infringement or willful infringement determinations
this court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

read 970 f.2d at 821 23 uspq2d at 1431 citations omitted
because a patent is presumed valid the quantum of proof required at trial was clear and convincing_evidence

``

whether or not an invention was in public_use within the meaning of *big_token__737_section_102__big_token b is a question of law which is based upon underlying issues of fact
manville sales corp. v. paramount sys. inc. 917_f.2d_544 549 16_uspq2d_1587 1591 fed.cir.1990
neither party disputes whether the alleged public_use would amount to a public_use as a matter of law
therefore to overturn the jurys finding of prior_public_use juicy_whip needed to show an absence of substantial_evidence on the underlying facts supporting the jurys verdict

with regard to inequitable_conduct` [ t ] here are a variety of ways in which the district_court may choose to handle the issue of inequitable_conduct during a jury trial'
hebert v. lisle corp. 99_f.3d_1109 1114 40_uspq2d_1611 1614 fed.cir.1996 citing modine mfg co. v. allen group inc. 917_f.2d_538 541 16_uspq2d_1622 1624 fed.cir.1990
here the district_court submitted the issue of inequitable_conduct to the jury
when an ultimate_question of law or fact is decided by the jury on review it is assumed that the jury resolved the evidentiary facts as appropriate to support the verdict
hebert 99 f.3d at 1114-15 40 uspq2d at 1614 ; newell cos. v. kenney mfg co. 864_f.2d_757 765 9_uspq2d_1417 1423 fed.cir.1988` judges must accept the factual_findings presumed from a favorable jury verdict which are supported under the substantial_evidence/reasonable_juror standard
``

on appeal of the jurys verdict of unenforceability due to inequitable_conduct we ascertain whether the presumed factual_findings of material withholding and deceptive intent were supported by substantial_evidence at the trial
we determine whether there was substantial_evidence whereby a reasonable_jury could have reached its verdict on the entirety of the record and in light of correct instructions on the applicable law
sun studs inc. v. ata equip
leasing inc. 872_f.2d_978 982 10_uspq2d_1338 1341 fed.cir.1989
thus to sustain its motion for jmol on its evidentiary challenge to the inequitable_conduct_issue juicy_whip needed to show an absence of substantial_evidence supporting the jurys finding that orange_bang had established unenforceability by clear and convincing_evidence

b
prior public use
on appeal juicy_whip argues two different reasons in support of its position that the record is devoid of substantial_evidence rising to the level of the clear and convincing_evidence necessary to invalidate its patent based on prior_public_use under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b
first it argues that the evidence does not establish that the alleged_anticipatory_dispensers included elements corresponding to all the limitations of the claims at issue
second it contends that the oral_testimony provided by the six witnesses was uncorroborated and thus does not rise to the clear and convincing_evidence necessary to establish a prior_public_knowledge or use
orange_bang argues that the verdict is supported by substantial_evidence and that its evidence of prior_public_use need not be completely corroborated by a writing

a person shall not be entitled to a patent if` the invention was.. in public_use.. more than one year prior to the date of the application for patent'
35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b 1994
when the asserted basis of invalidity is prior_public_use the party with the burden of proof must show that` the subject of the barring activity met each of the limitations of the claim and thus was an embodiment of the claimed invention'
scaltech inc. v. retec/tetra l.l.c. 178_f.3d_1378 1383 51_uspq2d_1055 1058 fed.cir.1999
generally oral_testimony of prior_public_use must be corroborated in order to invalidate *738 a patent
see finnigan_corp. v. int l_trade_comm n 180_f.3d_1354 1366-68 51_uspq2d_1001 1010-11 fed.cir.1999

orange_bang did not present an element-by-element comparison between the 1983_and_1988 dispensers and the asserted claims
moreover the jurys verdict is not broken down by claim_limitations
the verdict only indicated that` the asserted claims are invalid because the invention described in the claims of the ¡¬405_patent was in public_use prior to september 1 1988'
this court is tasked with determining whether substantial_evidence supports the jurys findings
specifically did orange_bang present substantial_evidence satisfying its clear and convincing burden of proof that it or its customers publicly practiced every limitation of method claim 6 and publicly used a dispenser with elements corresponding to each limitation of apparatus claim 9 more than a year before the filing_date of the ¡¬405_patent ?

our review of the record shows a lack of substantial_evidence supporting the jurys finding of invalidity under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b
we conclude that on the record no reasonable_juror could have found that orange_bang established-by clear and convincing_evidence-that the 1983_and_1988 dispensers were complete embodiments of the claimed invention
specifically the record lacks substantial_evidence regarding at least one limitation of each asserted claim
claim 6 is directed to a` method for inducing sales of a beverage' comprising the step of` positioning a transparent_display_bowl relative to the dispenser outlet to create the visual_impression that said bowl is the reservoir and principal_source from which a serving of the beverage is dispensed'
¡¬405_patent col._12,_ll._53-56
claim 9 requires that the dispenser be` positioned relative to said outlet to create the visual_impression that said container is the reservoir and principal_source of said dispensed_beverage issuing from said outlet'
¡¬405_patent col._13,_ll._10-13
while the record contains testimony from several witnesses which if believed by the jury indicates that some of the claim_limitations were found in the 1983_and_1988 dispensers the record is devoid of evidence showing that the above limitations were found in either dispenser

defendant_bruce_burwick testified at length about his involvement with the 1983 dispenser and his placing the dispenser with a customer in new_york
burwicks testimony provides the closest support for orange_bangs invalidity contentions q now as you know sir this case involves this post-mix dispenser with a bowl and a liquid that is not dispensed that simulates the beverage and gives a visual_impression that the liquid that you see is not what you are getting
a i know that that is what the case is about
q what is your earliest knowledge of a dispenser which in your judgment would have these features ?

* * * * * * a well i was speaking to dave fox and he had described to me that he had taken a-excuse me-a pre-mix dispenser a starline which-what i knew about starlines was they also contained just like a jet_spray a five-gallon bowl or reservoir and what he had done is said he had a fluid like an antifreeze fluid that there would be no spoilage but looked like his fruit punch ole drink in color and he said` you know i made this fluid and i put a post-mix valve' which to me would be a valve just like similar to the machine right next to the single bowl pre-mix starline
that was a fountain machine
and with my experience those are like post-mix valves

* * * * * * *739 and he installed that on the front panel of the starline machine and he said he connected a water_line to the back of the valve from the inside and a syrup line and he said it would be able to give a continuous volume from a bag in the box or a five-gallon tank which were both available at the time and that it would refrigerate the anti-freeze product that was in the bowl so that the bowl would still look cold
and he told me that this is what he did
he said how would you like to try one ?

* * * * * * q now you have this piece of equipment in new_york
what did you do with it ?

* * * * * * a well i offered it to frank_cretella who was a customer of mine at the staten_island_zoo_concession stand for a year..

* * * * * * q did the dispenser have any indication on it that that is the drink that was going to be dispensed ?

* * * * * * a it had on-i believe it had on all four sides of it like this machine has four sides the single starline it has a see-through six by 10 decal six inches wide-i think six inches wide by 10 inches high see-through decal that said punch ole

* * * * * * q i see
and did it draw drinks ?
a yes
q and could the public see it ?
a well it was right on the main concession stand where any person that walked into the staten_island_zoo_concession it was more than a food concession
it was a concession that sold zoo souvenirs and mementoes of your trips to the zoo and it was right there
the fruit punch ole
q did mr. cretella understand that it was a post-mix there were lines and he did n't have to fill the bowl ?
a he knew he did n't have to fill the bowl

burwicks testimony does not amount to clear and convincing_evidence that the bowl was positioned` to create the visual_impression that said bowl is the reservoir and principal_source from which a serving of the beverage is dispensed'
when asked directly about the claim_limitation at issue burwick replied` i know that that is what the case is about'
when asked whether the dispenser had any indication of what beverage was going to be dispensed burwick testified that stickers on the side of the dispenser showed what beverage consumers would get
claim 6 however requires that the positioning of the bowl` create [ s ] the visual_impression that said bowl is the reservoir and principal_source from which a serving of the beverage is dispensed'
burwicks testimony does not substantiate that limitation
moreover burwicks testimony regarding stickers on the side of the bowl does not satisfy the limitation in claim 9 requiring that the bowl` create the visual_impression that said container is the reservoir and principal_source of said dispensed_beverage issuing from said outlet'

the testimony from defendant fox likewise failed to establish that the alleged prior_art_dispensers satisfied these disputed claim_limitations
when asked about his conception of the 1988 dispenser fox testified that he had the idea of` getting some plastic bowls made and putting in a liquid that would represent the beverage
if it was orange_bang it would be orange
if it was punch bang it would be red..' *740 while this testimony may show that the 1988 dispenser had a bowl of colored liquid on top of it the claims require more
the testimony fails to prove that the bowl created the visual_impression that it functioned as the source of the beverage being dispensed
in fact fox was specifically asked whether consumers would notice that the beverage was flowing from a post-mix valve instead of straight from a pre-mix bowl q i know it was a post-mix valve instead of a pre-mix valve but just looking at it it would look pretty much as it looks here except it had this rod across the top right ?
a well being that im in the business i would recognize the post-mix valve if i saw that piece of equipment
q do you think the consumer of a beverage would have recognized that ?
a possibly
thus the testimony of the defendants failed to show that that consumers would think that the bowl was the principal reservoir of the beverage being dispensed

even if the testimony at trial were sufficient to correlate each element of the alleged_anticipatory_dispensers with each claim_limitation this court must still ascertain whether that type of evidence was adequate to support the jurys finding
historically courts have looked with disfavor upon finding anticipation with only oral_testimony
in the barbed_wire_patent 143_u.s._275 12_s.ct._443 36_l.ed._154_(1892) the supreme_court commented on the dangers of invalidating a patent on oral_testimony alone
in view of the unsatisfactory character of such_testimony arising from the forgetfulness of witnesses their liability to mistakes their proneness to recollect things as the party calling them would have them recollect them aside from the temptation to actual perjury courts have not only imposed upon defendants the burden of proving such devices but have required that the proof shall be clear satisfactory and beyond a reasonable_doubt
witnesses whose memories are prodded by the eagerness of interested parties to elicit testimony favorable to themselves are not usually to be depended upon for accurate information
id.at 284 12_s.ct._443

the barbed_wire_patent involved a dispute over the novelty of a patent for barbed_wire
twenty-four witnesses testified on behalf of an accused infringer that they had seen an anticipating barbed_wire_fence exhibited by one morley at an 1858_or_1859 county fair at delhi in delaware county iowa
id.at 285 12_s.ct._443
the witnesses included a boy who had been thrown against the fence and cut by the extruding barbs ; a deputy marshal who hitched his horse to a fence post near the barbed_wire_fence and returned to find the horses nose and breast bloodied by the barbs ; and a fair attendee named potter who saw an exhibit of the fence and was given a sample of the wire by morley
potter testified that he kept the sample in a trunk for more than ten years and then produced the sample at trial
id.at 286-87 12_s.ct._443
potters son however testified for the patentee and contradicted his fathers testimony saying that no such barbed_wire was kept in the trunk
the patentee also presented evidence including two copies of the delaware journal which listed the notice of the fair but did not mention morley or his fence
the district_court discounted both that evidence and the testimony from the patentees witnesses who attended the fair but had seen` nothing of the morley fence'
washburn & moen_mfg_. co. v. beatem all barb-wire_co. 33_f._261 270-71 c.c.n.d.iowa 1888
the district_court found that it was unlikely that all twenty-four witnesses *741 were lying and declared the patent invalid
washburn & moen_mfg. 33 f. at 272` not only is there an entire lack of evidence to show that such a nefarious plan had been undertaken but no motive can be conceived of that would induce so large a number of well-known persons to engage in such a conspiracy`
despite the testimony of twenty-four witnesses and the credibility determinations made by the trial court the supreme_court reversed noting [ t ] he very fact.. that almost every important patent from the cotton gin of whitney to the one under consideration has been attacked by the testimony of witnesses who imagined they had made similar discoveries long before the patentee had claimed to have invented his device has tended to throw a certain amount of discredit upon all that class of evidence and to demand that it be subjected to the closest scrutiny
the barbed_wire_patent 143 u.s. at 284-85 12_s.ct._4431

the court later clarified that the high_standard of proof required when using oral_testimony to prove prior_public_use was not` beyond a reasonable_doubt' as stated in the barbed_wire_patent but was nevertheless a high threshold
see eibel process co. v. minnesota & ontario paper co. 261_u.s._45 60 43_s.ct._322 67_l.ed._523_(1923)` the temptation to remember in such cases and the ease with which honest witnesses can convince themselves after many years of having had a conception at the basis of a valuable patent are well known in this branch of law and have properly led to a rule that evidence to prove prior discovery must be clear and satisfactory`
in light of this high_standard this courts predecessor adopted a list of factors for evaluating the credibility of oral statements
see in re reuter 670_f.2d_1015 1021 & n. 9 210_uspq_249 255 & n. 9 ccpa 1981
those factors include 1 delay between event and trial 2 interest of witness 3 contradiction or impeachment 4 corroboration 5 witnesses familiarity with details of alleged prior structure 6 improbability of prior_use considering state of the art 7 impact of the invention on the industry and 8 relationship between witness and alleged prior_user

this court especially in the context of proving priority of invention has analyzed this corroboration requirement with a` rule of reason' analysis
see price v. symsek 988_f.2d_1187 1195 26_uspq2d_1031 1037 fed.cir.1993

in woodland_trust v. flowertree nursery 148_f.3d_1368 47_uspq2d_1363_(fed.cir.1998) this court relying on the barbed_wire_patent reversed a finding of prior_public_knowledge and use based solely on uncorroborated_oral_testimony
*742 there the patentee owned a method patent for protecting a plot of foliage plants from freezing which established an insulating covering of ice over ground level watering
the accused infringer presented oral_testimony from four interested_witnesses that the method was previously known and used by each of joseph burke and william hawkins at their respective nurseries in florida
hawkins son testified that his fathers nursery was destroyed by a tornado in 1978 and not rebuilt until after the patent issued
burke testified that he used the patented system but tore it down in 1976
the district_court credited the statements of the accused infringers witnesses held the patent invalid and noted that` to discredit those witnesses in this case the court would be obliged to conclude that all four were deliberate perjurers'
id.at 1369-70 47 uspq2d at 1364-65
this court reversed holding that` uncorroborated_oral_testimony particularly that of interested persons recalling long-past events does not of itself provide the clear and convincing_evidence required to invalidate a patent on this ground'
id.at 1369 47 uspq2d at 1364
specifically the court noted that on the facts presented in light of the absence of any written corroboration and the length of time between the anticipating events and the trial the oral evidence alone was insufficient to invalidate the patent the supreme_courts view of human nature as well as human recollection whether deemed cynical or realistic retains its cogency
this view is reinforced in modern times by the ubiquitous paper trail of virtually all commercial activity
it is rare indeed that some physical record e.g. a written document such as notes letters invoices notebooks or a sketch or drawing or photograph showing the device a model or some other contemporaneous record does not exist
id.at 1373 47 uspq2d at 1367

the following_year in finnigan_corp. v. international_trade_commission 180_f.3d_1354 51_uspq2d_1001 fed.cir.1999 this court held that concerns regarding corroboration are not limited to` interested' witnesses
id.at 1367-68 51 uspq2d at 1011
finnegan was the assignee of a patent pertaining to a method for using a` quadruple ion trap' to generate a mass spectrum of a trapped sample
this court held that the claim_limitations at issue required the use of a nonresonance_ejection
id.at 1363-64 51 uspq2d at 1007-08
the commission found that the claimed invention had been the subject of prior_use by an uninterested witness keith b. jefferts
jefferts authored an article that disclosed all claim_limitations with the exception of the required use of a nonresonance_ejection
jefferts testified before the commission that he practiced every limitation of the claimed invention including the limitation missing from his article more than one year before the filing_date of the patent at issue
id.at 1364-66 51 uspq2d at 1008-10
jeffertss testimony was the only_evidence of the limitation missing from his article and was uncorroborated by any other testimony or evidence in the record
this court reversed the commission holding that under the circumstances of the case before it the oral_testimony alone was insufficient to establish prior_public_use in the end what we are left with is jefferts testimony concerning his alleged public_use
such evidence is insufficient as a matter of law to establish invalidity of the patent
this is not a judgment that jefferts testimony is incredible but simply that such_testimony alone can not surmount the hurdle that the clear and convincing_evidence standard *743 imposes in proving patent invalidity
see mahurkar v. c.r
bard inc. 79_f.3d_1572 1577 38_uspq2d_1288 1291 fed.cir.1996 noting that the corroboration rule` provides a bright line for both district_courts and the pto to follow..'
id.at 1370 51 uspq2d at 1012

here applying the reuter_factors we conclude that the evidence presented by orange_bang was insufficient as a matter of law to surmount the clear and convincing_evidence hurdle
the testimony about the 1983_and_1988 dispensers came more than eight and twelve years respectively after the witnesses saw the dispensers
cretella the only witness to use the dispensers to serve drinks in public kept the 1983 dispenser for only one month and the 1988 dispenser for less than three months
none of the six witnesses can be said to be disinterested
two of the witnesses fox and burwick are defendants in the case
stein was the operations_manager for the defendant_orange_bang
cretella was a long-time customer of burwick and burwick was a shareholder in a group of restaurants operated by cretella
goff the former beverage_dispenser manufacturer had known fox since 1977 and had a business relationship with foxs brother-in-law
finally massaro the maker of the acrylic_bowls for the 1988 dispenser was the senior_salesperson for a company that sold products to orange_bang the same year as the lawsuit
the six witnesses are sufficiently inter-connected to consider them` interested_witnesses' in the context of the reuter_factors
see oney v. ratliff 182_f.3d_893 896 51 uspq2d 1697 1700 fed.cir.1999` the uncorroborated_oral_testimony of [ the accused infringer ] as the inventor and his close associates would be insufficient to prove invalidity
``

the one writing proffered to corroborate the oral_testimony in this case is inadequate to meet the applicable standard of proof
reliable evidence of corroboration preferably comes in the form of physical records that were made contemporaneously with the alleged prior invention
see sandt tech. ltd. v. resco metal & plastics corp. 264_f.3d_1344 1350-51 60_uspq2d_1091 1094 fed.cir.2001` documentary or physical evidence that is made contemporaneously with the inventive process provides the most reliable proof that the inventors testimony has been corroborated'
( citing woodland_trust 148 f.3d at 1373 47 uspq2d at 1367
here the sketches of the 1983 dispenser were not drawn by goff and cretella until their depositions in this case
thus they are no more reliable than the oral_testimony accompanying the drawings
the purchase_order for clear_bowls corroborates the witnesses testimony that orange_bang purchased clear_bowls from massaro but still leaves the record devoid of any evidence that the bowls even if placed upon a post-mix dispenser created the visual_impression that the bowl was the reservoir and principal_source from which a serving of the beverage was dispensed.2 we do not conclude that the witnesses below were not credible
rather with the guidance of precedent cautioning against the reliance on oral_testimony alone we hold that the evidence of record did not provide the clear and convincing_evidence necessary to invalidate the patent for prior_public_knowledge
the district_court therefore erred by denying juicy_whips motion for jmol on anticipation

*744 c. inequitable conduct
on appeal juicy_whip argues that nothing in the boulahanis or bowers_declarations is false or misleading and to the extent that any part is misleading those parts are immaterial
in addition juicy_whip argues that orange_bang failed to present substantial_evidence of intent to deceive the pto
with respect to the stratton_letter juicy_whip contends that it is not prior_art and not relevant to any issue relating to patentability
orange_bang responds by arguing that the record supports the inequitable_conduct_finding by the jury
specifically it argues that both the boulahanis and bowers_declarations were material and misleading
furthermore by failing to provide the pto with a copy of the gus_stratton_letter addressed to the california_department of health_services orange_bang argues that the strattons withheld information that a reasonable_examiner would consider material

inequitable conduct entails a two-step analysis first a determination of whether the withheld reference meets a threshold_level of materiality and intent to mislead and second a weighing of the materiality and intent in light of all of the circumstances to determine whether the applicants conduct is so culpable that the patent should be unenforceable
see generally gfi inc. v. franklin corp. 265_f.3d_1268 1273-74 60_uspq2d_1141 1143 fed.cir.2001
both intent and materiality are questions of fact
baxter int l inc. v. mcgaw inc. 149_f.3d_1321 1327 47_uspq2d_1225 1228-29 fed.cir.1998
`` the more material the omission the less culpable the intent required and vice versa'
halliburton co. v. schlumberger tech corp. 925_f.2d_1435 1439 17_uspq2d_1834 1838 fed.cir.1991
the challenged conduct must be sufficient to require a finding of deceitful intent in light of all the circumstances
kingsdown med consultants ltd. v. hollister inc. 863_f.2d_867 873 9_uspq2d_1384 1389 fed.cir.1988 en banc in relevant part

we conclude that the record is devoid of substantial_evidence rising to the level of the clear and convincing_evidence necessary to render the patent unenforceable
specifically orange_bang failed to present substantial_evidence of materiality regarding the boulahanis_declaration and stratton_letter or of intent to mislead regarding the bowers_declaration
we begin with the boulahanis_declaration
it is undisputed that every statement in the declaration is a true statement
boulahanis was in fact a former_employee of an orange_bang_distributor
it was perhaps misleading however for the strattons to re-submit the declaration knowing that the examiner misunderstood by whom boulahanis was employed
however to the extent that the declaration was misleading the second and third times it was submitted the misleading part of the declaration was not material to the declaration or the application
the declaration was directed to the problems in the prior_art and the advances of the strattons invention
orange_bang acknowledges that the problems raised by boulahanis such as the difficulty in cleaning the pre-mix dispensers were indeed problems that were solved by the strattons invention
every statement in the declaration relating to the claimed invention is true
the relevant inquiry before the examiner was whether the claimed invention solved a long-felt need not who said the invention solved the long-felt need
while the court is bothered by the strattons failure to correct the examiners misunderstanding the clarified identity of boulahaniss employer was immaterial to the issue before the examiner

*745 likewise the submission of the bowers_declaration can not serve as the source of an inequitable_conduct_finding
in its appellate brief orange_bang argues that the bowers_declaration` misrepresented the commercial_success of the strattons dispensers by the coca-cola company' and` unquestionably contained false information'
however orange_bang does not identify any specific statements in the declaration that it contends juicy_whip knew to be false
the jury had before it the coca-cola_protest which points to a number of statements in the declaration that it contended were false statements
the protest ultimately failed with the examiner noting that the bowers_declaration is supported by other declarations of coca-cola managers
whether the statements in the bowers_declaration were false or misleading is irrelevant to our inquiry however because orange_bang failed to present any evidence that the strattons knew or considered the bowers_declaration to contain anything untrue or that the declaration was submitted with any intent to mislead the examiner

in his declaration bowers discusses his personal opinions of the state of the beverage dispensing industry and the happenings within coca-cola regarding their problems associated with beverage dispensing equipment
the record reflects a disagreement between bowers and coca-cola over what was happening within coca-cola
the record does not reflect however that the strattons knew that anything in the bowers_declaration was false or misleading at the time they submitted it to the pto
proving that the bowers statements were false or misleading without accompanying proof of an intent to mislead falls short of the showing needed to support a finding of inequitable_conduct
orange_bang had the burden at trial of proving by clear and convincing_evidence that the strattons acted with an intent to mislead the examiner
at the time the strattons submitted the bowers_declaration coca-cola had ordered 10,000 machines from juicy_whip
furthermore several other coca-cola executives submitted affidavits on behalf of juicy_whip
the only_evidence orange_bang points to for support of its theory of intent to mislead is the fact that juicy_whip hired bowers nearly two years after his declaration
that alone is not substantial_evidence supporting a finding of an intent to mislead
no reasonable_juror could conclude that the strattons submitted the bowers_declaration with an intent to mislead the patent_examiner

finally the draft of the letter from gus_stratton to the california_department of health_services is immaterial as a matter of law
the letter is not a complete description of the claimed invention and is not otherwise prior_art
orange_bang argues that in light of gus_strattons belief that a disclaimer was necessary to dispel consumer confusion a reasonable_examiner may have considered this information material
however this court in juicy_whip i rejected orange_bangs contention that the claimed invention lacked utility under 35 u.s.c.¡± 101 because its purpose was to deceive the public
juicy_whip i 185 f.3d at 1366-68 51 uspq2d at 1702-03
because an inventions deceptive nature has no bearing upon its utility no examiner could conclude that the letter was material to patentability

because neither of the two declarations nor the stratton_letter meets the threshold_level of materiality or intent to mislead we need not weigh the materiality and intent in light of all the circumstances to determine whether the strattons conduct was so culpable that the patent should be unenforceable
*746 the judgment of inequitable_conduct therefore must be set aside.3

iii
conclusion
for the foregoing reasons we reverse the district_courts denial of juicy_whips motions for jmol on the issues of anticipation and inequitable_conduct
further we vacate the award of costs and remand the case for a determination of damages
on remand the district_court will have discretion based on the jurys finding of willfulness not contested in this appeal to determine whether to enhance damages under 35 u.s.c.¡± 284

reversed-in-part vacated-in-part and remanded

mayer chief_judge dissenting
because the jurys finding of prior_public_use under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b was supported by substantial_evidence i would affirm the district_courts holding that u.s._patent_no._5575,405 is invalid

during trial orange_bang attempted to establish that its owner david_fox had constructed and publicly used a beverage_dispenser that fully anticipated the claimed invention
to that end it presented the testimony of six witnesses david_fox bruce_burwick patrick goff frank_cretella john massaro and richard stein
the court states that orange_bang failed to present sufficient evidence that the anticipating device possessed each and every limitation of the claims at issue
specifically the court says the evidence was insufficient as to the limitation of claim 6 requiring` positioning a transparent_display_bowl relative to the dispenser outlet to create the visual_impression that said bowl is the reservoir and principal_source from which a serving of the beverage is dispensed' and the limitation of claim 9 that requires that the dispenser be` positioned relative to said outlet to create the visual_impression that said container is the reservoir and principal_source of said dispensed_beverage issuing from said outlet'
ante at 738-39
however i believe the court fails to appreciate the presentation conducted by david_fox
consequently it erroneously concludes that no reasonable_jury could reach the result that it did

during trial orange_bang brought a starline pre-mix dispenser exhibit 64 into the courtroom
a starline pre-mix dispenser is common in the marketplace and has a clear plastic bowl positioned above the dispenser outlet
from the counter up it closely resembles the dispenser depicted in figure 1 of the ¡¬405_patent
ante at 731
counsel then asked fox to explain to the jury how he converted this pre-mix dispenser to a post-mix dispenser
q
by mr. schwab could you explain to the jury using exhibit [ 64 ].. what you did sir
a
yes
what i did was i took this nozzle off of the dispenser and in the case of dispensers like this it had a spacer
now the reason it had a spacer that was about an inch long wide or long was so that this part would come out a little further to accommodate a whipping chamber here so the product could go down
*747 so when i took off the spigot it had a spacer which was screwed into the bolt and that spacer had a little_hole in it about a quarter of an inch
so when you pulled the handle the fluid would go through the little_hole and come down into the cup
so i plugged that hole with silicone and so that the liquid in the bowl would not come out
and below it i put on a valve a small little valve on the front of it and then attached two conduits one for water and one for syrup
and that was where it would connect to a water_line and the bag and box and this little valve had a lever on it
you pushed the lever activated the bag and box system and brought the product to the head and with the little funnel into the cup

the technology and claims at issue are not complex
as fox was describing to the jury the steps that he undertook to retrofit the starline_dispenser it could have quite easily determined for itself as it must have done that the display_bowl was positioned relative to the dispenser outlet to create the visual_impression that the bowl is the reservoir and principal_source from which a serving of the beverage is dispensed
we were not present for this demonstration and it was not recreated for us at oral argument nor should it have been
the jury is the ultimate finder of fact and to second guess it in the manner that has been done here substantially invades its province
see bio-tech
gen. corp. v. genentech inc. 267_f.3d_1325 1330 60_uspq2d_1430 1434 fed.cir.2001

foxs testimony was not the only_evidence presented on these claim_limitations
as the court sets forth in detail burwick testified that fox had described to him what he had done specifically converting a pre-mix starline_dispenser to a post-mix dispenser
ante at 738-40
goff testified that he observed and operated the retrofitted dispenser at the houston_distributorship in the spring of 1983 and summer of 1984
cretella testified that he used the dispenser in april of 1984
stein testified that he saw fox working on the retrofitted dispenser in 1984
the jury saw foxs demonstration was aware of what a converted starline_dispenser looked liked and heard the additional testimony of the other witnesses
it was well within their province to determine that the manner in which the device had been converted would create the visual_impression that the bowl is the reservoir and principal_source from which a serving of the beverage is dispensed

the court continues that even if orange_bang had presented evidence of all of the limitations the result would have been the same because of a lack of corroboration
i respectfully disagree

while the six witnesses presented by orange_bang may have been interested in the outcome to varying degrees the level of interest is only one of the eight factors set out in in re reuter 670_f.2d_1015 1021 & n. 9 210_uspq_249 255 & n. 9 ccpa 1981 testimony as to all of which was before the jury
this is not a situation like finnigan_corp. v. int l_trade_comm n 180_f.3d_1354 51_uspq2d_1001 fed.cir.1999 where only one witness testified or washburn & moen_mfg_. co. v. beatem all barbed-wire_co. 143_u.s._275 12_s.ct._443 36_l.ed._154_(1892) where while 24 witnesses testified the invention at issue was a subtle_improvement over the prior_art that would be easily missed by anyone other than a keen_observer skilled in the art
at issue here was a drink dispenser whose claimed elements were easily discernible
moreover the witnesses who testified were experienced *748 in the industry and understood the state of the art at the time that fox retrofitted the starline_dispenser
the jury was aware of all of the detracting factors that might call into question their testimony and it still found the patent invalid
to decide on appeal without having seen the witnesses that the testimony was insufficient as a matter of law is a distortion of our role in the judicial process

the dissent distinguishes this case from the barbed_wire_patent because unlike this case that case involved an invention that was` a subtle_improvement over the prior_art that would be easily missed by anyone other than a keen_observer skilled in the art'
the record of the trial proceedings in the barbed_wire_patent reveals that among the twenty-four witnesses who testified that they had seen the claimed barbed_wire_fence several years prior to the application at issue some of the witnesses were skilled in the art
washburn & moen_mfg. 33 f. at 268
for example one of the witnesses h.l
bates was a blacksmith who attended the county fair with morley and helped morley put the barbed_wire_fence in place for the exhibition
id
bates testified at trial that he made the tools with which the wires were twisted to form the barbs
id
during a recess in the trial bates made a set of tools which were then entered into evidence and used in a courtroom demonstration showing that the claimed barbed_wire could be made with those tools
id
2
the dissent focuses on a demonstration by fox before the jury using a starline pre-mix dispenser
however this testimony is no more reliable than any of the other oral_testimony bearing in mind that the reuter_factors do not include a category for oral_testimony accompanied by an admittedly non-anticipatory visual aid

a district_court operates within its discretion when it instructs the jury to find and weigh the facts surrounding the inequitable_conduct_defense and to decide the ultimate_question of inequitable_conduct

in light of our disposition on the inequitable_conduct_issue we do not reach juicy_whips contention that the district_court erred by making the jury finding binding upon the parties
