linn circuit_judge
this patent infringement action returns to us for a second time after having been previously appealed and remanded on claim construction and infringement questions in trimed inc. v. stryker_corp. 514_f.3d_1256 fed.cir.2008` trimed i`
in the present appeal trimed incorporated` trimed' challenges a decision of the united_states_district_court for the central_district of california granting summary_judgment of invalidity of the asserted claims of u.s. patent no._5931,839` the ¡¬839_patent` in favor of stryker corporation` stryker'
because the district_court improperly resolved genuine_issues of material_fact in favor of stryker and because reassignment is advisable to preserve the appearance of justice we reverse and remand with an instruction to reassign this matter to a different_judge

i
background
a
the ¡¬839_patent
trimed is the owner of the ¡¬839_patent which covers an implantable_device used to set bone_fractures such as a type of wrist fracture known as a colles fracture
the ¡¬839_patent describes four prior_art methods of setting a colles fracture two of which merit discussion here
in the first method referred to as open_reduction and internal fixation a surgeon cuts open the wrist places the fractured_bones back in their original position i.e. reduces the bone_fractures and` appl [ ies ] plates screws and pins as needed'
¡¬839_patent col.2 ll.6-8
this usually involves the surgeon opening the skin above the fracture and positioning a metal plate across the fracture
the surgeon then attaches the plate to both the stable and fractured_bone_fragments with screws
the open_reduction technique has several drawbacks
first the method requires the surgeon to make screw_holes in the fractured_bone which can lead to further fragmentation
second if the fractured_bone is small or osteoporotic the screw threads can not attach the screw to the bone
finally rotation of the screw into the fractured_fragment causes compression across the fracture which may cause the fragment to shatter

the second method known as percutaneous pinning involves inserting a first end of one or more small pins called kirschner wires also referred to as` k-wires' through a fractured_bone_fragment across the fracture and into a stable_bone_fragment leaving the other_end of each pin extending out of the fractured_bone_fragment
because a pin is less likely to weaken a fragmented bone pins are better suited than screws for fixating small or osteoporotic_bone_fragments
however because pins have a tendency to bend or be displaced doctors generally apply a cast to immobilize the wrist and elbow of the patient while the bone heals subjecting the patient to the stiffness and loss of function associated with the use of casts

the ¡¬839_patent describes an implantable_device that includes three kinds of *1337 components screws pins and a plate with screw_holes on one end of the plate and pin holes on the opposite_end thereof
the patent explains that unlike prior_art techniques of setting fractures the invention permits` rigid fixation of fracture fragments while allowing immediate motion of a joint'
¡¬839_patent col.3 ll.22-43
figures 1_and_5 of the ¡¬839_patent are illustrative of an embodiment of the device

?
in one method of implanting the device a surgeon opens the skin above a fracture 11 slides a pin 8 through a fractured_bone_fragment 9 across the fracture 11 and embeds the pin 8 in a stable_bone_fragment 10 leaving the other_end of the pin 8 extending above the fractured_fragment 9
the surgeon then positions a plate 1 across the fracture 11 such that the end of the pin 8 extending above the fractured_fragment 9 rests in a pin hole 3
as we observed in trimed i the hole 3 stabilizes the projecting end of the pin 8 against movement in the plane of plate 1 and allows the pin 8 to slide axially through the plate 1 while preventing compression across the fracture 11
514 f.3d at 1260
the surgeon places the opposite_end of the plate 1 over the stable_bone_fragment 10 and attaches the plate 1 to this fragment by inserting screws 7 through screw_holes 2 in the plate 1 into the stable_bone_fragment 10

b
prior proceedings
on march_30,_2006 trimed initiated the underlying action against stryker asserting that a wrist fixation device manufactured and sold by stryker infringes claims 1 2 and 7-11 of the ¡¬839_patent
claim 1 the independent claim from which the other_asserted_claims depend reads as follows 1
an implantable_device for fixation of at least one fractured_bone_fragment to a stable_bone_fragment said implantable_device comprising an implantable plate having opposite_end portions fastening means for securing one end portion of said plate to stable bone at least one fixation_pin for penetrating said at least one fractured_bone_fragment and traversing a fracture for entering the stable_bone_fragment and for being secured therein at a stable fixation site at a far end of said fixation_pin the opposite near_end of said pin being adapted for *1338 extending from the fractured_bone_fragment said near_end of said pin being engageable in one of a plurality of holes in the other_end portion of the plate said holes in said plate providing means for allowing the pin to slide axially therein but preventing compression across the fracture and stabilizing said near_end of the pin against displacement in the plane of the plate
'839_patent col.6 ll.17-32

after the completion of discovery the district_court granted strykers motion for summary_judgment of noninfringement simply signing strykers statement of uncontroverted facts and conclusions of law and entering judgment in favor of stryker
on appeal this court determined that the district_court had incorrectly construed the` means for allowing the pin to slide' limitation as being subject to 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 paragraph 6 reversed the judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings
trimed i 514 f.3d at 1261-62

on remand stryker moved for summary_judgment of invalidity on the ground that an article entitled` treatment of complex intra-articular distal radius fractures' by stephen j. leibovic m.d
and william b. geissler m.d
(` the leibovic_article' and u.k. patent application no
gb 2_245_498 a listing eugen may as the inventor` the may_application' each anticipates the asserted claims
stryker argued that images in the leibovic_article show a fracture set using an arrangement of pins and plates with holes that satisfies the limitations of the asserted claims
regarding the may_application stryker contended that the application discloses a plate that has holes for screws and smaller holes for guide_wires
stryker asserted that the may_application is anticipatory because the guide_wire plate and guide_wire hole disclosed in the may_application perform the same functions as the plate fixation_pin and hole of the asserted claims of the ¡¬839_patent

stryker also argued that the claims at issue would have been obvious in light of either the leibovic_article or the may_application combined with an article entitled` percutaneous kirschner-wire fixation of colles fractures' by gary j. clancey m.d
(` the clancey_article'
stryker characterized the clancey_article as disclosing the conventional percutaneous pinning method previously discussed
stryker asserted that trimed simply combined known elements from these references and employed a logical commonsense_solution to the problem of stabilizing pins against displacement-selecting a prior_art_plate with holes of the appropriate_size relative to the pin
stryker also argued that combining the elements disclosed in either the leibovic_article or the may_application with the pinning technique disclosed in the clancey_article would achieve predictable_results
to support these arguments stryker relied on the declaration of its expert dr. barry feinberg

in response trimed filed a memorandum contesting nearly every aspect of strykers motion for summary_judgment
according to trimed the leibovic_article describes setting a first_fragment using plates and screws in the conventional open_reduction and internal_fixation_method described above
trimed claimed that the article also discusses repositioning a separate second fragment within the articular joint and inserting k-wires underneath the repositioned fracture to prevent the fracture from collapsing
trimed alleged that the k-wires do not pass through the holes in the plate used to set the first_fragment *1339 and therefore neither the disclosed holes nor the disclosed wires meet the limitations of the asserted claims
trimed argued that the may_application fails to teach the claimed device because the disclosed guide_wires are temporarily inserted into holes in the plate to maintain alignment during surgery and do not perform the functions of the claimed fixation_pin
moreover trimed argued that the disclosed holes do not prevent compression across the fracture or stabilize the near_end of a pin as required by the claims

trimed also challenged strykers claim that the combination of either the may_application or the leibovic_article with the clancey_article rendered the asserted claims obvious arguing that neither of the proposed combinations would result in the claimed invention
trimed further contended that the invention was not a logical commonsense_solution to a known problem nor were the results achieved by the invention predictable
finally trimed presented evidence of secondary_considerations of nonobviousness that showed that the orthopedic industry was initially skeptical of the invention but later praised it
trimed submitted a declaration from its expert dr. robert medoff in support of these contentions

in deciding strykers motion the district_court again simply signed strykers uncontroverted statement of facts and conclusions of law without any changes other than crossing out the anticipation section and granted summary_judgment of invalidity in favor of stryker
trimed timely appealed and we have jurisdiction under 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

ii
discussion
on appeal trimed argues that the district_court improperly resolved genuine_issues of material_fact in favor of stryker and urges us to reverse the district_courts grant of summary_judgment and remand this matter with an instruction to reassign the case to a different_judge
stryker argues in opposition that none of the material_facts are in dispute and that the district_court properly determined that the asserted claims would have been obvious
stryker contends that we can also uphold the district_courts judgment on anticipation_grounds

stryker also complains that trimed improperly filed an expert declaration after the district_court barred trimed from filing expert reports
trimed contends that strykers expert is not one of ordinary_skill in the art
although these arguments were raised before the district_court the court did not address them
because as a general matter` a federal appellate court does not consider an issue not passed upon below' singleton v. wulff 428_u.s._106 120 96_s.ct._2868 49_l.ed.2d_826_(1976) we decline to address these arguments in the first instance and refer them to the district_court for consideration on remand

we begin by addressing the parties invalidity contentions and then turn to strykers request to reassign this matter

a. invalidity
we review de novo the district_courts grant of summary_judgment` reapplying the standard applicable at the district_court'
young v. lumenis inc. 492_f.3d_1336 1345 fed.cir.2007
summary_judgment is proper` if the pleadings the discovery and disclosure materials on file and any affidavits show that there is no genuine_issue as to any material_fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law'
fed.r.civ.p
56 c
in *1340 assessing summary_judgment the evidence is viewed` through the prism of the evidentiary standard of proof that would pertain at a trial on the merits'
sram corp. v. ad-ii eng g inc. 465_f.3d_1351 1357 fed.cir.2006
because patents are presumed valid` a moving party seeking to invalidate a patent at summary_judgment must submit such clear and convincing evidence of facts underlying invalidity that no reasonable jury could find otherwise'
id

trimed argues that the district_court improperly resolved a number of material_factual disputes in favor of stryker
these disputes include the following 1 whether the guide_wire discussed in the may_application is a fixation_pin ; 2 whether the holes disclosed in either the leibovic_article or the may_application stabilize the near_end of a fixation_pin against displacement and prevent compression across a fracture ; and 3 whether the leibovic_article shows a k-wire passing through a plate
trimed further contends that the district_court ignored its evidence of secondary_considerations of nonobviousness

trimed also takes issue with the characterization of the claimed subject_matter as a commonsense predictable_combination of known elements
trimed contends that the functions of the claimed holes and plates are fundamentally different from the functions of the holes and plates described in the asserted prior_art references
according to trimed prior_art_plates acted as loadbearing members to support fractured_bone_fragments whereas the sole function of the claimed plate is to provide holes for the pin
the claimed holes allow the pin to slide axially while preventing compression across the fracture and stabilize the near_end of the pin against displacement in the plane of the plate-functions that trimed claims were not performed by prior_art holes
trimed contends that the results achieved by the claimed invention would not have been predictable because it was unknown at the time of the invention whether holes could perform these functions

in response stryker argues that the ¡¬839_patent_claims a predictable_combination of known prior_art_elements that operate according to their established functions
as noted above it was known at the time of the invention that screws are ill-suited to attach a plate to small or osteoporotic_bone_fragments and that pins are a more appropriate means to fixate these kinds of fragments
stryker reasons that this knowledge would have led one of skill in the art at that time to modify the open_reduction and internal_fixation_method by replacing the screw used to attach the plate to the fractured_bone_fragment with a pin
it was also well-known at the time of the invention that pins tended to bend or be displaced which could impede healing
stryker argues that common_sense and logic would have suggested selecting a plate with holes of an appropriate_size to prevent the pin from bending or moving
because trimed does not dispute that these fixation methods and their associated advantages and disadvantages were known at the time of the invention stryker contends that the district_court correctly determined that there are no genuine_issues of material_fact and properly granted summary_judgment of invalidity in strykers favor

we agree with trimed
a patent is invalid` if the differences between the subject_matter sought to be patented and the prior_art are such that the subject_matter as a whole would have been obvious *1341 at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary_skill in the art to which said subject_matter pertains'
35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a
whether the claimed subject_matter would have been obvious at the time of invention to one of ordinary_skill in the pertinent art is a question of law based on underlying facts
winner int l royalty corp. v. wang 202_f.3d_1340 1348 fed.cir.2000
the relevant factual inquiries include the oft-cited graham factors 1 the scope and content of the prior_art ; 2 the differences between the claimed invention and the prior_art ; 3 the level of ordinary_skill in the art ; and 4 any relevant secondary_considerations.. dystar textilfarben gmbh & co. deutschland kg v. c.h
patrick co. 464_f.3d_1356 1360 fed.cir.2006 citing graham v. john deere co. of kansas city 383_u.s._1 17-18 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966)
summary_judgment of obviousness is appropriate if` the content of the prior_art the scope of the patent_claim and the level of ordinary_skill in the art are not in material dispute and the obviousness of the claim is apparent in light of these factors'
ksr int l co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 427 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007)

when determining whether a patent_claiming a combination of known elements would have been obvious we` must ask whether the improvement is more than the predictable use of prior_art_elements according to their established functions'
id.at 417 127_s.ct._1727
this inquiry is factual in nature
cf
medichem s.a. v. rolabo s.l. 437_f.3d_1157 1165 fed.cir.2006 explaining that whether there is` a reasonable expectation of success in making the invention via' a combination of prior_art_elements is a question of fact
answering this question usually entails considering the` interrelated teachings of multiple patents ; the effects of demands known to the design_community or present in the marketplace ; and the background_knowledge possessed by a person having ordinary_skill in the art all in order to determine whether there was an apparent reason to combine the known elements in the fashion claimed by the patent at issue'
ksr 550 u.s. at 418 127_s.ct._1727
what a reference teaches whether there is a trend or demand in the relevant marketplace or design_community the background_knowledge of one of skill in the art-these are all questions reserved for the finder of fact
see digital control inc. v. charles mach
works 437_f.3d_1309 1316 fed.cir.2006` [ w ] hat a reference teaches is a question of fact..' ; monarch knitting mach corp. v. sulzer morat gmbh 139_f.3d_877 882 fed.cir.1998` whether the prior_art discloses atrend is a question of fact
`` ; gen. elec co. v. nintendo co. 179_f.3d_1350 1363 fed.cir.1999 concluding that a genuine_issue of material_fact existed regarding the background_knowledge of one of skill in the art
these factual_questions are not separate and distinct from those set out in graham ; rather they fall comfortably within those familiar categories of factual inquires
see e.g. dystar 464 f.3d at 1360 noting that what the prior_art teaches is a subsidiary determination of the scope and content of the prior_art

many of these factual_questions are in dispute here
for instance the parties dispute what the asserted prior_art teaches
specifically the parties disputed the following 1 whether either the may_application or the leibovic_article discloses the claimed holes ; 2 whether the may *1342 application discloses the claimed fixation_pin ; and 3 whether the leibovic_article shows a k-wire passing through a plate

8 contending that the leibovic_article does not show a k-wire passing through a plate
the parties also disputed whether the claimed invention achieves predictable_results and uses prior_art_elements according to their established functions
compare feinberg_decl
16` [ i ] t would have been obvious.. to combine the [ asserted references ] because the combination of these references achieves predictable_results..

to the contrary.. the mechanics of fixation [ are ] completely different from that of screws plates and the compressive forces used to fix fractured_fragment [ s ]`
strykers argument that these disputes are immaterial ignores how the resolution of these questions informs the obviousness inquiry in this case

stryker attempts to circumvent these genuine_issues of material_fact by suggesting that the claimed subject_matter would have been obvious because it is at least in part a commonsense_solution to a known problem
as we explained in perfect web technologies inc. v. infousa inc. 587_f.3d_1324 1329 fed.cir.2009 an obviousness_analysis` may include recourse to logic judgment and common_sense available to the person of ordinary_skill that do not necessarily require explication in any reference or expert opinion'
although reliance on common_sense does not require a specific evidentiary basis` on summary_judgment to invokecommon_sense or any other basis for extrapolating from prior_art to a conclusion of obviousness a district_court must articulate its reasoning with sufficient clarity for review'
id.at 1330
see also in re kahn 441_f.3d_977 988 fed.cir.2006` [ t ] here must be some articulated reasoning with some rational underpinning to support the legal conclusion of obviousness`
while rule 52 a 3 of the federal rules of civil procedure contains the pertinent qualification that a` court is not required to state findings or conclusions when ruling on a motion under rule 12_or_56' that rule` does not relieve a court of the burden of stating its reasons *1343 somewhere in the record when its underlying holdings would otherwise be ambiguous or inascertainable [ sic ]' couveau v. am
airlines inc. 218_f.3d_1078 1081_n._3_(9th_cir.2000) citation omitted
`` assuredly to know the reasoning a district_court used in deciding to grant summary_judgment facilitates the task of a reviewing court and there does exist a risk in complicated cases of an unnecessary reversal if the logic that resulted in the grant of summary_judgment can not be discerned'
cable elec prods. inc. v. genmark inc. 770_f.2d_1015 1020 fed.cir.1985 overruled on other grounds by midwest indus. inc. v. karavan trailers inc. 175_f.3d_1356_(fed.cir.1999)
both the record in this case and the order granting strykers motion for summary_judgment are devoid of such reasoning
instead of supporting its obviousness_analysis with cogent reasoning the order merely states that` [ a ] common_sense [ sic ] solution to this problem [ i.e. pin migration ] involves stabilizing the pin against.. displacement.. [ and ] the logical solution would be to select a prior_art_plate that had holes with an appropriate diameter..' order granting strykers mot
for summ
j. of invalidity 14
neither the record before us nor the order of the district_court explains why one of ordinary_skill in the art at the time of the invention would have found replacing a cast normally used to stabilize a pin with a subcutaneous metal plate to be a logical commonsense_solution to this problem
merely saying that an invention is a logical commonsense_solution to a known problem does not make it so

the record also fails to explain why the district_court summarily dismissed the evidence of secondary_considerations of nonobviousness submitted by trimed
we have repeatedly held that evidence of secondary_considerations must be considered if present
see e.g. ruiz v. a.b
chance co. 234_f.3d_654 667 fed.cir.2000` our precedents clearly hold that secondary_considerations when present must be considered in determining obviousness`
there is no indication in the record that as required by our precedent the court considered at all the evidence of secondary_considerations offered by trimed

stryker also argues that the leibovic_article and the may_application each anticipates the asserted claims
`` [ i ] nvalidity by anticipation requires that the four corners of a single [ ] prior_art document describe every element of the claimed invention either expressly or inherently'
advanced display sys. inc. v. kent state univ. 212_f.3d_1272 1282 fed.cir.2000
whether a prior_art reference anticipates a patent_claim is a question of fact
id.at 1281
as we discussed above there are genuine_issues of material_fact regarding whether either of these references teaches all of the limitations recited in claim 1 the claim from which the other_asserted_claims depend

because there are genuine_issues of material_fact and because the record fails to provide a reasoned basis to support the district_courts grant of summary_judgment we conclude that the courts grant of summary_judgment of invalidity was inappropriate and must be reversed

b. reassignment
we evaluate a request to reassign a matter to a different_judge under the law of the relevant regional circuit research corp. technologies v. microsoft corp. 536_f.3d_1247 1255 fed.cir.2008 here the ninth_circuit
in the ninth *1344 circuit reassignment is appropriate if personal bias or unusual_circumstances are shown
smith v. mulvaney 827_f.2d_558 562 9th cir.1987
when determining whether unusual_circumstances exist the ninth_circuit considers the following factors 1 whether the original judge would reasonably be expected upon remand to have substantial difficulty in putting out of his or her mind previously-expressed views or findings determined to be erroneous or based on evidence that must be rejected 2 whether reassignment is advisable to preserve the appearance of justice and 3 whether reassignment would entail waste and duplication out of proportion to any gain in preserving the appearance of fairness
id.at 563

we conclude that reassignment is warranted here
the district_court has now been reversed twice after entering summary_judgment against trimed in both instances simply signing strykers proposed statement of law and facts relevant to the decided issues a disfavored practice in the ninth_circuit see living designs inc. v. e.i
dupont de nemours & co. 431_f.3d_353 373 9th cir.2005 noting that the ninth_circuit has` criticized district_courts thatengaged in the` regrettable practice' of adopting the findings drafted by the prevailing party wholesale
`` citation omitted
although mindful of the burden reassignment places on judicial resources given the particular circumstances present here we are convinced that reassigning this matter to a different_judge is necessary to preserve the appearance of justice
thus pursuant to our supervisory authority under 28 u.s.c.¡± 2106 we remand this case to the chief judge of the united_states_district_court for the central_district of california to determine the reassignment of this case to a different_district_judge

iii
conclusion
for the foregoing reasons we reverse the district_courts grant of summary_judgment of invalidity and remand for reassignment of this case to a different_district_judge

reversed and remanded
