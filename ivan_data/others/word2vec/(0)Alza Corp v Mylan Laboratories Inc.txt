gajarsa circuit_judge alza_corp.` alza' appeals from the district_courts judgment after a bench_trial of noninfringement and invalidity of claims 1-3 11 13_and_14 of u.s. patent no._6124,3551` the355_patent` in favor of mylan_laboratories inc. and mylan pharmaceuticals inc. collectively` mylan'
alza_corp. v. mylan labs. inc. 388_f.supp.2d_717 n.d.w.va.2005` alza_ii`
the infringement arose from mylans filing of two abbreviated new drug applications` andas' for a generic_version of the once-a-day extended_release_formulation of the anti-incontinence drug oxybutynin id.at 720 which alza has been marketing as ditropan_xlthe_r
id.at 738
this court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1
for the reasons stated below we affirm the district_courts judgment of noninfringement and invalidity

i
background
this litigation arose from mylans and impaxs filings of andas for once-daily controlled-release_oxybutynin_formulations
oxybutynin is a drug used to treat urinary incontinence
once-a-day dosing provides the usual benefits of convenience steady-dosing and in addition possibly reduced absorption of a metabolite that leads to side-effects
claim 2 of the355_patent is representative
2
a sustained-release_oxybutynin_formulation for oral administration to a patient in need of treatment for urge_incontinence comprising a therapeutic dose of an oxybutynin selected from the group consisting of oxybutynin and its pharmaceutically acceptable salt that delivers from 0_to_1 mg in 0_to_4 hours from 1 mg to 2.5 mg in 0_to_8 hours from 2.big_token__75_to_4__big_token25 mg in 0_to_1 4 hours and 3.75 mg to 5 mg in 0_to_24 hours for *1289 treating urge_incontinence in the patient

the district_court construed the355_patent claims in its markman order reported at alza_corp. v. mylan labs. inc. 349_f.supp.2d_1002_(n.d.w.va.2004)` alza i`
the court construed the word` deliver' to refer to the rate of in vivo release in the gastrointestinal` gi' tract
see id.at 1019

alza did not present direct_evidence that mylans anda_formulation released drug in the gi_tract at the rates claimed by the355_patent
however it did offer two other types of evidence 1 the rate at which the generic product released oxybutynin in an in vitro dissolution apparatus and 2 the rate at which the anda_product resulted in the accumulation of oxybutynin in the bloodstream

the district_court found that alza had failed to meet its burden of proof on infringement
the district_court also found the asserted claims of the355_patent to be invalid as both anticipated and obvious in light of the prior_art
for the reasons stated below we affirm the invalidity holding on obviousness_grounds and consequently we do not need to reach alzas arguments regarding anticipation
we also affirm the holding of noninfringement

discussion
a
standard of review
infringement is a question of fact that after a bench_trial we review for clear_error
see e.g. ferguson beauregard/logic controls div
of dover res. inc. v. mega sys. llc 350_f.3d_1327 1338 fed.cir.2003
under the clear_error standard a reversal is permitted only when this court is left with a definite and firm conviction that the district_court was in error
medichem s.a. v. rolabo s.l. 437_f.3d_1157 1164 fed.cir.2006

as for obviousness a claimed invention is unpatentable if the differences between it and the prior_art are` such that the subject_matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary_skill in the art'
35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a 2000 ; in re kahn 441_f.3d_977 985 fed.cir.2006 citing graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 13-14 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545 1966
obviousness is a question of law reviewed de novo based upon underlying factual questions which are reviewed for clear_error following a bench_trial
ruiz v. a.b
chance co. 357_f.3d_1270 1275 fed.cir.2004
these` underlying factual inquiries includ [ e ] 1 the scope and content of the prior_art ; 2 the level of ordinary_skill in the prior_art ; 3 the differences between the claimed invention and the prior_art ; and 4 objective evidence of nonobviousness'
in re dembiczak 175_f.3d_994 998 fed.cir.1999
similarly` [ t ] he presence or absence of a motivation to combine references in an obviousness determination is a pure question of fact' in re gartside 203_f.3d_1305 1316 fed.cir.2000 ; accord winner int l royalty corp. v. wang 202_f.3d_1340 1348 fed.cir.2000 as is the presence or absence of a` reasonable_expectation of success' from making such a combination medichem s.a. v. rolabo s.l. 437_f.3d_1157 1165 fed.cir.2006
because` a patent retains its statutory presumption of validity see 35 u.s.c.¡± 282.. the movant retains the burden to show the invalidity of the claims by clear and convincing evidence as to underlying facts'
mcginley v. franklin sports inc. 262_f.3d_1339 1349 fed.cir.2001 internal_quotations omitted

in graham the court held that that the obviousness_analysis begins with several basic factual inquiries` [ 1 ] the scope *1290 and content of the prior_art are to be determined ; [ 2 ] differences between the prior_art and the claims at issue are to be ascertained ; and [ 3 ] the level of ordinary_skill in the pertinent_art resolved'
383 u.s. at 17 86_s.ct._684
after ascertaining these facts the court held that the obviousness vel non of the invention is then determined` against th [ e ] background` of the graham factors
id.at 17-18 86_s.ct._684 emphasis added
clearly the court recognized the importance of guarding against hindsight as is evident in its discussion of the role of secondary_considerations as` serv [ ing ] to guard against slipping into use of hindsight and to resist the temptation to read into the prior_art the teachings of the invention in issue'
id.at 36 86_s.ct._684

the court of appeals for the federal_circuits and its predecessors` motivation to combine' requirement likewise prevents statutorily proscribed hindsight reasoning when determining the obviousness of an invention
kahn 441 f.3d at 986` [ t ] hemotivation-suggesting-teaching requirement protects against the entry of hindsight into the obviousness_analysis
`` ; in re fridolph 30_c.c.p.a._939 942 134_f.2d_414_(1943)` [ i ] n considering more than one reference the question always is does such art suggest doing the thing the [ inventor ] did`
according to the` motivation-suggesting-teaching' test a court must ask` whether a person of ordinary_skill in the art possessed with the understandings and knowledge reflected in the prior_art and motivated by the general problem facing the inventor would have been led to make the combination recited in the claims'
kahn 441 f.3d at 988 citing cross_med
prods. inc. v. medtronic sofamor danek inc. 424_f.3d_1293 1321-24 fed.cir.2005

this requirement has been developed consistent with the supreme_courts obviousness_jurisprudence as expressed in graham and the text of the obviousness statute that directs us to conduct the obviousness_inquiry` at the time the invention was made' 35 u.s.c.¡± 103
as we explained in kahn the motivation-suggestion-teaching test picks up where the analogous art test leaves off and informs the graham analysis
to reach a non-hindsight driven conclusion as to whether a person having ordinary_skill in the art at the time of the invention would have viewed the subject_matter as a whole to have been obvious in view of multiple references the board must provide some rationale articulation or reasoned basis to explain why the conclusion of obviousness is correct
the requirement of such an explanation is consistent with governing obviousness law.. 441 f.3d at 987
we further explained that the` motivation to combine' requirement` [ e ] ntails consideration of both thescope and content of the prior_art andlevel of ordinary_skill in the pertinent_art aspects of the graham test'
id.at 986

at its core our anti-hindsight jurisprudence is a test that rests on the unremarkable premise that legal determinations of obviousness as with such determinations generally should be based on evidence rather than on mere speculation or conjecture
our courts analysis in kahn bears repeating a suggestion teaching or motivation to combine the relevant prior_art teachings does not have to be found explicitly in the prior_art as` the teaching motivation or suggestion may be implicit from the prior_art as a whole rather than expressly stated in the references..
the test for an implicit showing is what the combined teachings knowledge of one of ordinary_skill in the art and the nature of the problem to be *1291 solved as a whole would have suggested to those of ordinary_skill in the art'
however rejections on obviousness_grounds can not be sustained by mere conclusory statements ; instead there must be some articulated reasoning with some rational underpinning to support the legal_conclusion of obviousness
this requirement is as much rooted in the administrative procedure act [ for our review of board determinations ] which ensures due process and non-arbitrary decisionmaking as it is in ¡± 103
441 f.3d at 987-88 quoting in re kotzab 217_f.3d_1365 1370 fed.cir.2000 citations omitted emphases added
there is flexibility in our obviousness_jurisprudence because a motivation may be found implicitly in the prior_art
we do not have a rigid test that requires an actual teaching to combine before concluding that one of ordinary_skill in the art would know to combine references
this approach moreover does not exist merely in theory but in practice as well
our recent decisions in kahn and in cross_medical products amply illustrate the current state of this courts views
see kahn 441 f.3d at 988 affirming the ptos obviousness finding explaining that a motivation to combine may be found in implicit factors such as the` knowledge of one of ordinary_skill in the art and [ what ] the nature of the problem to be solved as a whole would have suggested to those of ordinary_skill in the art' ; cross_med
prods. 424 f.3d at 1322 reversing a district_court ruling of nonobviousness and explaining that` the motivation to combine need not be found in prior_art_references but equally can be found in the knowledge generally available to one of ordinary_skill in the art' such as knowledge of a problem to be solved

in conclusion our approach has permitted us to continue to address an issue of law not readily amenable to bright-line rules as we recall and are guided by the wisdom of the supreme_court in striving for a` practical test of patentability'

b
description of the technology
the patent at issue is directed generally to an extended release form of oxybutynin
because the subject_matter of the patent falls roughly under the rubric of pharmacology we give a brief orientation to the field based upon the record
in general when a drug is swallowed it is 1 dissolved in the gastrointestinal` gi' tract ; 2 absorbed from the gi_tract into the bloodstream ; 3 distributed from the blood into body tissues ; and 4 metabolized and eliminated from the bloodstream
the gi_tract includes the stomach small_intestine and the colon and orally administered drugs pass through these portions of the gi_tract in turn
drugs may be administered in different dosage_forms,2 which may include not only the drug itself but also ingredients intended to modulate the rate of release of the drug from the dosage_form

dosage forms may be described as immediate-release e.g. such as where the drug is quickly released in the stomach or as sustained/extended-release where the drug is slowly released as the formulation traverses the gi_tract
the rate of absorption of a drug from the gi_tract into the bloodstream may change as it passes through the gi_tract
the rate of absorption for a dissolved drug in a given portion of the gi_tract also varies from drug to drug

after roughly 8-12 hours a typical dosage_form will reach the colon
if hypothetically a particular_drug is simply not absorbed from the colon into the bloodstream *1292 then it may make little sense to develop an extended-release dosage_form that is capable of` withholding' the release of some fraction of that drug until it reaches the colon
in other words under these hypothetical conditions there may be little motivation to design an oral dosage_form capable of releasing drug more slowly than over an approximately 8-12 hour time course because such drug would be released in the colon where it is hypothetically not absorbed

the355_patent claims an extended_release_oxybutynin_formulation
alza argues that one of ordinary_skill in the art would not have believed that oxybutynin could be absorbed in the colon
absent such absorption alza contends that one of ordinary_skill in the art lacked the motivation to make the claimed extended_release_formulation and that the district_court therefore erred in holding that the asserted claims are invalid as obvious over the prior_art
for the reasons set forth below alzas arguments fail

c. invalidity
the district_court based its invalidity holding both on anticipation and obviousness_grounds
because we affirm its holding based on obviousness we do not need to address the parties anticipation arguments

in finding the asserted claims of the355_patent to be obvious the district_court considered inter_alia the following prior_art u.s patent nos._5399,359` the baichwal_patent' ; 5,082,688` the wong_patent' ; and 5,330,766` the morella_patent'

the morella_patent discloses a` sustained-release pharmaceutical composition including an active_ingredient of high solubility in water..' according to the specification highly soluble drugs had posed special challenges for the development of sustained release forms which the inventors had set out to solve
`` sustained-release' is defined as release of the active_ingredient at a rate that maintains therapeutic non-toxic blood levels` over an extended period of time e.g
1big_token__0_to_24__big_token hours or greater'
highly water soluble drugs were considered to be those having an aqueous solubility of at least roughly 1 part in 30
the commercially available hydrochloride salt of oxybutynin is freely soluble at neutral ph
the patent uses morphine as an example of an active_ingredient that can be used in its compositions
figure 5 demonstrates that one such composition is capable of dispensing morphine at what appears to be an approximately steady rate over the course of 24 hours
claim 2 of the patent claims` genitourinary smooth muscle relaxants' as one of several types of active_ingredients to use in the dosage_form identified in claim 1
the specification also identifies oxybutynin as a highly water soluble genitourinary smooth muscle relaxant
morella also teaches that` the dissolution rate of the soluble drug at various phs can be modified at will'

the baichwal_patent teaches a 24 hour extended_release_oxybutynin_formulation
these formulations use an enteric-coated polymer matrix similar to mylans accused product
it also teaches methods of modifying the dosage_forms to slow the release_rates
during prosecution of the355_patent the inventor overcame an anticipation rejection by arguing that his invention had a release rate slower than those of the dissolution data presented in baichwal.3 the examiner agreed and withdrew his rejection

*1293 the wong_patent teaches a bilayer osmotic pump dosage_form` the oros system' used in the preferred embodiment of the355_patent
wong teaches that this system can be used to deliver any drug over a 24 hour_period and figure 11 of the patent discloses release_rates falling within the claimed release_rates of the355_patent
the wong_patent does not specifically teach using oxybutynin with the claimed release_technology but it does teach using several categories of drugs of which oxybutynin is a member such as anti-cholinergics analgesis muscle relaxants and urinary tract drugs

in analyzing the obviousness issue the district_court first identified the level of ordinary_skill in the art finding the person of ordinary_skill to have either an advanced degree in pharmacy biology chemistry or chemical engineering and at least two years of experience with controlled-release_technology ; or a bachelors degree in one or more of those fields plus five years of experience with such technology
second the court examined whether there was a motivation` in the prior_art or elsewhere that would have led one of the ordinary_skill in the art to combine references' alza_ii 388 f.supp.2d at 737 citing ruiz 234 f.3d at 664 internal_quotations omitted and with a` reasonable_expectation of success' id
( citing in re o'farrell 853_f.2d_894 904 fed.cir.1988
third the district_court examined secondary_considerations of nonobviousness
after making these factual_determinations it concluded that mylan had established a strong prima facie case of obviousness which alza had failed to rebut through secondary_considerations
the court concluded that mylan had demonstrated alzas patent to be invalid for obviousness by clear and convincing evidence.4 we agree

while we have carefully considered all of the parties arguments we discuss principally the dispute over satisfaction of one predicate to a finding of obviousness that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have had a` motivation to combine' the prior_art to achieve the claimed invention and that she would have had a` reasonable_expectation of success' in doing so
as an initial_matter we agree with the district_court that` on a purely mechanical level a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have a reasonable_expectation of success of manufacturing a 24 hour controlled-release_oxybutynin_formulation.. once motivated to use oxybutynin'
id.at 739
for example wong teaches a rate adjustable extended release dosing technology and release_rates falling within the claimed parameters
baichwal and wong likewise teach ways of achieving slow rates of release with baichwal actually teaching extended-release oxybutynin although arguably not as slowly as is claimed in the355_patent5

indeed alzas principal argument is that no one of ordinary_skill in the art would have been motivated to adapt the morella baichwal and wong technology to oxybutynin in the first place because a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have had no reason to expect that such an extended_release_oxybutynin_formulation would have therapeutic value
the issues as explained above reduce essentially to whether one of ordinary_skill in the art in 1995 would have had a reasonable_expectation *1294 that oxybutynin would be colonically absorbed and therefore would have been motivated to produce the claimed extended_release_formulation

the district_court concluded that` the weight of the evidence clearly and convincingly establishes that a person of ordinary_skill in the art in 1995 would reasonably expect oxybutynin to absorb in the colon.. [ and ] have a reasonable_expectation of success of producing a 24 hour oxybuytnin formulation meeting the claims of the355_patent
`` 6 alza_ii 388 f.supp.2d at 740
alza argues however that the district_court erred because` [ t ] here was no prior_art evidence supporting this finding'
according to alza` [ t ] here was no contemporaneous documentation supporting the view that any one factor-lipophilicity or anything else-existed to identify successful candidates for once-a-day delivery'
it also argues that two prior_art_references` decisively undercut' the opinion of mylans expert dr._amidon which the district_court cited in support of its conclusion
see alza_ii 388 f.supp.2d at 739-740

as an initial_matter it is essential to recognize that as we have explained above under our non-rigid` motivation-suggesting-teaching' test a suggestion to combine need not be found in the prior_art
see cross_med
prods. 424 f.3d at 1322` [ t ] he motivation to combine need not be found in prior_art_references but equally can be found in the knowledge generally available to one of ordinary_skill in the art..'
accordingly where the testimony of an expert witness is relevant to determining the knowledge that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have possessed at a given time this is one kind of evidence that is pertinent to our evaluation of a prima facie case of obviousness
we now turn to consider whether the relevant evidence including the expert testimony and the prior_art when viewed as a whole supports the findings of the district_court
we conclude that the findings of the district_court were not clearly erroneous

mylans expert dr._amidon testified that based on its lipophilicity he would` expect oxybutynin to be a highly permeable' compound that is` rapidly absorbed' along the length of the gi_tract including the colon
later when challenged about the predictive value of lipophilicity dr._amidon explained` i would say there were some unknowns but again lipophilic_drugs would be well absorbed
that would be-that was the general understanding at the time'

although alza argues that two prior_art_references` decisively undercut dr._amidons hindsight opinion' these references are in fact not inconsistent with the general principle that the extent of a drugs colonic_absorption correlates with its lipophilicity
indeed the first reference a 1990 publication in the journal of pharmaceutical sciences states that` [ i ] n general the more lipophilic_drugs were transported rapidly'
p. artursson epithelial transport of drugs in cell culture
i a model for studying the passive diffusion of drugs over intestinal absorptive caco-2 cells
79 j. pharm
sci
476 481 1990
*1295 alza however cites this reference narrowly for its observation that a highly lipophilic analog of a particular_drug did not follow the general rule that lipophilic_drugs were transported more quickly
id
granted the authors admit that` [ t ] he reason for this [ deviation ] is currently unknown' and they postulate that it may be related to a physicochemical factor other than lipophilicity namely steric hindrance.7 id
but the mere fact that the colonic_absorption rate of a drug may be predicted most precisely by using` many factors' rather than` lipophilicity' alone does not negate the general predictive utility of lipophilicity in estimating the extent of colonic_absorption

the second prior_art reference cited by alza absorption of polar drugs following caecal instillation in healthy volunteers is similarly unavailing to it
riley et al. 6 aliment
pharmacol
ther
701 705 1992
again this reference teaches that while the correlation is not perfect lipophilicity tended to suggest colonic_absorption stating that` [ t ] he relationship between the physical characteristics of a drug and its colonic_absorption is not yet clear but studies in the rat suggest that lipophilic_drugs are well absorbed along the length of the gastrointestinal tract whereas hydrophobic polar drugs are absorbed much less from the colon than from the small_intestine'
id
( emphasis added

far from teaching away or detracting from the weight of dr._amidons testimony these prior_art_references taken as a whole are entirely consistent with the finding that in 1995 a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have expected a general albeit imperfect correlation between a drugs lipophilicity and its colonic absorptivity
accordingly we can not perceive clear_error in the district_courts factual findings that while colonic_absorption was not guaranteed the evidence viewed as a whole is clear and convincing that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would nonetheless have perceived a reasonable likelihood of success and that she would have been motivated to combine prior_art_references to make the claimed invention

likewise we find no error in the district_courts consideration of secondary indicia of obviousness
we therefore affirm its legal_conclusion of obviousness finding the district_court to have correctly held that mylan met its burden of overcoming the presumption of validity that attaches to an issued patent

d. infringement
the355_patent specifically describes the rate of oxybutynin release from its` extended release' formulations requiring that the time-course of in vivo oxybutynin release falls within certain boundaries
that is at certain times the cumulative amount of dissolved released drug must fall within certain ranges
to prove infringement alza bore the burden of proving inter_alia that mylans accused generic formulation exhibited an in vivo release profile falling within the claimed ranges at the relevant times

at trial alza presented no direct_evidence of how quickly the accused product dissolved in vivo
alza_ii at 722
however it did offer two kinds of indirect_evidence as measures of the rate of in vivo release
id
first it presented evidence of the blood plasma_concentration versus time profiles for both the accused anda_formulation and ditropan an embodiment *1296 of the355_patent
second it presented evidence of the rate of release not in the gi_tract but in pieces of laboratory apparatus under certain experimental conditions so-called in vitro dissolution
the critical deficiency in the evidence presented by alza was not that it was` indirect' rather than` direct' but rather that it failed to credibly link these pieces of evidence with the relevant pharmacokinetic parameter-the rate of in vivo_dissolution in the gi_tract

thus the district_court explained that alza had failed to demonstrate how evidence of the rate of dissolution of drug in the gi_tract could be extracted from plots of plasma_concentration versus time
the district_court accepted alzas simplifying assumption about oxybutynin rapidly being absorbed following dissolution such that the rates of in vivo_dissolution parallel the rate of drug uptake into the blood
however it found that only one expert dr._amidon had` endorsed alzas subjective comparison of blood plasma levels with in vivo release_rates'
as for that one expert moreover he` rejected the very conclusion that alza attributed to him'

alza criticizes the district_court for` fail [ ing ] to come to grips with the significance of the testimony' that dr._amidon` recanted.. immediately after he made it'
specifically alza urges that notwithstanding the experts recantation we should nonetheless draw our independent conclusions from the` point of his testimony' that release_rates in blood and the appearance in the gi_tract are essentially the same
we have considered alzas arguments and find them to lack legal and factual coherency
even if we were to presume to be experts and to apply the simplifying assumption that the drug is rapidly taken up into the bloodstream upon dissolution it is not clear to us how to abstract from each plasma_concentration versus time curve the rate of uptake into the bloodstream
this would require factoring out of the curve the effects inter_alia of the elimination of drug from the bloodstream over the relevant 24 hour_period
but this is not our province
such evidence if it exists must have been presented at trial or in its stead other evidence sufficient to persuade the trial court

from what can be discerned dr._amidons immediately recanted statement appears to have been based on his comparison of the relative areas under the curves of plasma_concentration versus time plots of both the accused anda_formulation and ditropan_xl
indeed alza reproduces in its appellate brief dr._amidons testimony that the accused product has only 92_to_93 percent of the area under the curve of ditropan_xl
this appears to have resulted in the drawing of a line referred to by the parties as` line_a' on a plot of in vitro dissolution of both ditropan_xl and the accused anda_formulation wherein the rate of in vitro dissolution of mylans anda_formulation has been adjusted according to that percentage
the basis for and significance of line_a is simply not apparent from the record and alza fails to provide us with any persuasive line of argument as to how we should imbue line_a with any relevant meaning
in short we agree with mylan that the plasma_concentration versus time data fail to establish in vivo release_rates for either ditropan_xl or the accused anda_product

the district_court similarly found unpersuasive alzas evidence that ditropan_xl and the accused anda_product sometimes exhibited in vitro dissolution_rates falling within the claims
the court cited testimony by dr._amidon explaining that these in vitro procedures are` not designed to reflect the in vivo_dissolution process'
this accords with the common sense notion that one can not simply proclaim without proof that he has constructed an apparatus capable of mimicking pertinent *1297 environmental variables of the gi_tract along the length of the tract nonetheless
indeed the obtained in vitro dissolution_rates vary widely with the choice of experimental parameters
we agree with the district_court that alzas evidence of in vitro dissolution_rates is irrelevant absent evidence demonstrating that the in vitro system is a good model of actual in vivo behavior
on that point alzas evidence is severely lacking

we therefore affirm the district_courts finding of noninfringement
in so doing we explicitly reject alzas suggestion that the district_court erred in failing to specifically state that not only did it find alzas plasma_concentration data and its` in vitro` data to be inadequate in isolation but that it had also found the data to be inadequate in combination
even if we were to entertain the suggestion that the district_court was in fact unfamiliar with the basic precept that it is the totality of the evidence that it must consider in making factual_determinations we would merely conclude that where as here if each of two pieces of evidence assessed separately is severely inadequate to support a proposition when their probative values are tallied they still fall short
while it is possible to envision cases in which two pieces of evidence may create great probative value synergistically this is not one of those cases

* * * * * *

in conclusion we affirm the judgment of the district_court that the asserted claims of the355_patent were invalid and that notwithstanding the patent was not infringed
