genetics_institute llc` genetics' appeals from the decision of the united_states_district_court for the district of delaware dismissing its action under 35 u.s.c.¡± 291 for lack of an interference in fact between certain_claims of its u.s. patent 4,868,112 the` ¡¬112_patent` and certain_claims of u.s
patents 6,228 620_and_6060,447 the` ¡¬620_patent` and the` ¡¬447_patent` ; collectively the` novartis_patents'
novartis asserts that the expiration of the ¡¬112_patent following the district_courts entry of judgment renders us without jurisdiction over genetics appeal
novartis also asserts that the district_court lacked jurisdiction over certain *1294 claims of the ¡¬112_patent because its term extension under 35 u.s.c.¡± 156 applied only on a claim-by-claim_basis
because the district_court did not err in dismissing genetics ¡± 291 action for lack of an interference in fact and because we disagree with novartiss jurisdictional arguments we affirm

background
i
the district_courts opinion summarizes the science underlying the patented technology in this case which relates to truncated forms of a protein called factor_viii
genetics inst. llc v. novartis_vaccines & diagnostics inc. 687_f.supp.2d_486 490-92 d.del.2010
factor_viii is an essential blood-clotting protein that circulates freely in the blood in an inactive state
factor_viii becomes activated as part of a chain of reactions called the` blood-clotting cascade' which causes the formation of a blood clot to stop bleeding from damaged blood vessels
defects in the gene encoding factor_viii result in hemophilia a a genetic disorder associated with prolonged bleeding

the human_factor_viii_protein is stabilized in the bloodstream by binding to von willebrand factor` vwf' a large blood protein that prevents the degradation of factor_viii
id.at 491
if factor_viii is not able to form a complex with vwf the half-life of factor_viii in plasma is reduced about five-fold
thus while factor_viii retains its procoagulant_activity even without vwf binding the association of factor_viii with vwf is critical for the optimal regulation of blood_coagulation
in addition a factor_viii_protein that can not bind vwf may cause unwanted clots in areas such as heart vessels because unbound factor_viii can bind blood platelets even when no injury has been detected

the full-length_factor_viii_protein consists of 2,332 amino_acid_residues-the chemical building blocks of proteins
id
the protein contains several regions or` domains' each of which folds into a three-dimensional structure independent of the others
factor_viii contains the following domains a1 a2 b a3 c1 and c2
the figure below depicts the locations of these domains in the full-length_factor_viii_protein
see br
of pl.-appellant at 9 ; see also def.-appellee br.at 10-11
the` heavy_chain' or` a domain' portion of the protein consists of amino_acids 1_to_740 and contains the a1 and a2 domains as well as two acidic regions known as a1 and a2.1 the b_domain contains amino_acids 741_to_1648
the` light_chain' or` c_domain' portion of the protein consists of amino_acids 1649_to_2332
it contains a third acidic region a3 as well as the a3 c1 and c2 domains
the a3_acidic_region of particular importance to the dispute in this case contains amino_acids 1649_to_1689
it is directly adjacent to the b_domain

?
*1295 treating patients with hemophilia a traditionally involved administering partially purified factor_viii derived from porcine or human plasma
in the 1980s however human plasma sources had become contaminated with viruses such as hiv and hepatitis making treatment with plasma-derived factor_viii dangerous
recombinant factor_viii produced from dna cloning offered a safer and more abundant new source of therapeutic material
scientists raced to clone_factor_viii successfully for the first_time
yet cloning factor_viii proved to be an enormous technical undertaking because the factor_viii_protein was nearly ten times larger than any protein previously cloned
the large_size of the dna sequence encoding the full-length_factor_viii_protein also complicated the cloning process
id.at 491-92

once the feat of cloning the full-length_factor_viii_protein was achieved researchers focused their efforts on finding a smaller more easily cloned recombinant_protein that mimicked the biological_activity of factor_viii in humans
id.at 492
those efforts formed the basis of the patents at issue in this appeal
as described below scientists discovered that portions of the full-length_factor_viii_protein were unnecessary for procoagulant_activity and they designed truncated_factor_viii_proteins lacking these portions
scientists further found that the a3_acidic_region of factor_viii is responsible for binding to vwf and is therefore critical to factor_viiis performance

the ¡¬112_patent is assigned to genetics a wholly owned subsidiary of wyeth which itself was recently acquired by pfizer inc.
genetics 687 f.supp.2d at 489-90
the ¡¬112_patent which issued on september 19 1989 claims priority from an application filed april_12,_1985 and names john j. toole jr. as the sole inventor
the ¡¬112_patent was set to expire on september 19 2006 at the end of its seventeen-year term
in 2000 however genetics obtained a patent_term_extension under 35 u.s.c.¡± 156 based on the time consumed by testing and regulatory_review of its commercial recombinant_factor_viii_protein refactothe_r
the united states patent and trademark_office` pto' extended the term of the ¡¬112_patent to february 28 2010

at issue in this appeal are claims 1 5 9 and 10 of the ¡¬112_patent
these claim respectively a recombinant_dna whose expression_results in a truncated_factor_viii_protein ; a host_cell containing the recombinant_dna ; a method of producing the truncated_factor_viii_protein by culturing the host_cells ; and a truncated human_factor_viii_protein

the truncated_factor_viii_protein of claims 1 5 and 9 has the amino_acid_sequence for human_factor_viii_protein except that in the region between amino_acid 740 and amino_acid 1690 a number of amino_acids are deleted ; the size of the deletion ranges from at least 581 to all 949 amino_acids in this region.2 the region *1296 eligible for deletion encompasses the inactive_b_domain amino_acids 741_to_1648 and the a3_acidic_region in the light_chain amino_acids 1649_to_1689
claim 10 claims a truncated_factor_viii_protein having one of three specific_deletions between amino_acids 981_to_1563 ; 759_to_1640 ; or 759_to_16753

novartis_vaccines and diagnostics inc.` novartis' is the assignee of the ¡¬620 and ¡¬447_patent s. both of the novartis_patents claim priority from an application filed january 27 1986

at issue in the ¡¬620_patent are claims 68 74 and 83
claim 68 claims a nucleic_acid expressing a truncated recombinant_factor_viii_protein in which all or part of the b_domain is deleted
the claimed recombinant_protein retains the amino_acids in the heavy_chain amino_acids 1_to_740 and the light_chain amino_acids 1649_to_2332 including the a3_acidic_region with the requirement that these retained portions have at least 90 %_sequence_identity to the native human_factor_viii_protein
the protein also optionally retains certain amino_acids in the b_domain up to 10 amino_acids contiguous to amino_acid 740 and up to 10 amino_acids contiguous to amino_acid 1649.big_token__4_claim_74__big_token claims a host_cell containing *1297 nucleic_acid capable of expressing the truncated recombinant_factor_viii_protein and claim 83 claims a method of producing the truncated recombinant_factor_viii_protein by culturing the host_cell

the only claim at issue in the ¡¬447_patent is claim 1 which claims a composition comprising factor_viii_proteins consisting essentially of two polypeptides a first comprising an amino_acid_sequence of the heavy_chain a domain and a second comprising an amino_acid_sequence of the light_chain c_domain
at least 90 %_sequence_identity with each region is required.5

iii
on may_16,_2008 genetics sued novartis in the united_states_district_court for the district of delaware to determine priority of invention under 35 u.s.c.¡± 291
genetics alleged that an interference in fact existed between the following claims 1 claim 1 of the ¡¬112_patent and claim 68 of the ¡¬ 620 patent ; 2 claim 5 of the ¡¬112_patent and claim 74 of the ¡¬620_patent ; 3 claim 9 of the ¡¬112_patent and claim 83 of the ¡¬620_patent ; and 4 claims 9_and_10 of the ¡¬112_patent and claim 1 of the ¡¬447_patent
genetics asserted that all three patents are directed to the same_subject_matter viz. truncated_factor_viii_proteins lacking all or part of the b_domain while retaining procoagulant_activity

novartis moved to dismiss arguing that the court lacked subject_matter_jurisdiction because the extension of the ¡¬112_patent under 35 u.s.c.¡± 156 applied to fewer than all of that patents claims
novartis further argued that there was no interference in fact between the asserted claims because the novartis_patents-unlike the ¡¬112_patent -are directed to truncated_factor_viii_proteins that preserve the functional a3_acidic_region

in a memorandum order dated february 24 2010 the district_court construed the disputed claim language of the ¡¬112_patent
genetics inst. llc v. novartis_vaccines & diagnostics inc. no
civ08-290-slr 2010_wl_677745_(d.del._feb._24,_2010)
in a memorandum opinion of the same date the district_court held that the patent_term_extension under ¡± 156 applied to all claims of the ¡¬112_patent
genetics 687 f.supp.2d at 497
the court also granted novartiss motion to dismiss holding that there was no interference in fact as to any of the allegedly interfering claims
id.at 502
the court entered its final_judgment on february 25 2010
on march_12,_2010 genetics filed a timely notice of appeal

under 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1 we have jurisdiction over final_judgments arising under the patent_laws

discussion
i. appellate jurisdiction
as noted the district_court entered final_judgment on february 25 2010 and the extended_term of the ¡¬112_patent expired three days later on february 28 2010
on april_12,_2010 novartis filed a motion in this court to dismiss genetics appeal for lack of subject_matter_jurisdiction in light of the expiration of the ¡¬ *1298 112 patent
in an order dated december 1 2010 we denied the motion to dismiss genetics appeal dismissed novartiss related cross-appeal and directed the parties to present arguments in their briefs on the issue of jurisdiction
genetics inst. llc v. novartis_vaccines & diagnostics inc. 403_fed.appx._512 512-13 fed.cir.2010

novartis disputes our jurisdiction over genetics appeal
novartis contends that we should dismiss genetics appeal because the expiration of the extended_term of the ¡¬112_patent following the district_courts entry of final_judgment divested this court of jurisdiction
relying on albert v. kevex corp. 729_f.2d_757_(fed.cir.1984) novartis argues that` invocation of section 291 requires the rather unusual step of the court dismissing the action for lack of jurisdiction after the filing of a well-pleaded complaint whenever it becomes apparent that there is no interference'
def.-appellee br.at 29

genetics argues in response that we have jurisdiction over its appeal despite the expiration of the ¡¬112_patent
genetics contends that an interference_action under ¡± 291 may apply to any patent including an expired patent
genetics contrasts ¡± 291 with an interference_action under ¡± 135 which by its terms is limited to unexpired_patents
genetics further contends that the holding in albert is limited to disclaimed patents and does not extend to expired patents

we have an independent obligation to determine whether subject_matter_jurisdiction exists over an appeal
litecubes llc v. n. light prods. inc. 523_f.3d_1353 1362 fed.cir.2008 ; see also arbaugh v. y & h corp. 546_u.s._500 514 126_s.ct._1235 163_l.ed.2d_1097_(2006)
as we explain below we conclude that we possess jurisdiction over the present_appeal

the dispute over appellate_jurisdiction in this case boils down to the parties divergent interpretations of albert 729_f.2d_757
that case like this one involved an interfering patents_action under 35 u.s.c.¡± 291
section 291 reads the owner of an interfering patent may have relief against the owner of another by civil_action and the court may adjudge the question of the validity of any of the interfering patents in whole or in part
the provisions of the second paragraph of section 146 of this title shall apply to actions brought under this section
albert asserted among other causes of action that claims in his patent interfered with claims of a patent owned by kevex corporation
albert 729 f.2d at 759
albert also asserted that the claims of the kevex patent were invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b
subsequently kevex filed in the pto a disclaimer of the claims in its patent that allegedly interfered with alberts claims
the trial_court held that the filing of the disclaimer mooted the interfering patents_action
id.at 760
yet the trial_court proceeded to evaluate alberts invalidity contentions ultimately granting alberts motion for summary judgment of invalidity
id

kevex argued on appeal that the existence of an interference in a ¡± 291 action is jurisdictional such that the district_court was required to determine that the patents interfered before determining the validity of either
id
we agreed and held that after the entry of kevexs disclaimer there were no interfering patents to support jurisdiction for an action under ¡± 291
id.at 760-61
we therefore vacated and remanded to the district_court with instructions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction
id.at 762

novartis seeks to enlarge our holding in albert to reach patent expirations
we reject this expansive reading and we decline to extend alberts holding beyond *1299 the effect of a patent disclaimer in a ¡± 291 action
disclaimers of patent claims are provided for under 35 u.s.c.¡± 253 which provides in part that a patentee whether of the whole or any sectional interest therein may on payment of the fee required by law make disclaimer of any complete claim stating therein the extent of his interest in such patent
such disclaimer shall be in writing and recorded in the patent and trademark_office ; and it shall thereafter be considered as part of the original_patent to the extent of the interest possessed by the disclaimant and by those claiming under him
id
( emphasis added
disclaiming particular_claims under ¡± 253` effectively eliminate [ s ] those claims from the original_patent'
vectra fitness inc. v. tnwk corp. 162_f.3d_1379 1383 fed.cir.1998
in other_words upon entry of a disclaimer under ¡± 253 we treat the patent as though the disclaimed claim s had` never existed'
id
(` this court has interpreted the termconsidered as part of the original_patent in section 253 to mean that the patent is treated as though the disclaimed claims never existed
``

we held in albert that` the court has no jurisdiction under ¡± 291 unless interference is established'
729 f.2d at 760-61` [ i ] nterference between patents is a sine qua non of an action under ¡± 291`
jurisdiction under ¡± 291 thus requires the existence of an interference and a claim that` never existed' vectra 162 f.3d at 1383 can not form the basis for an interference
because the disclaimer in albert precluded any basis for an interference between the patents in suit we held that it also eliminated jurisdiction under ¡± 291

unlike a disclaimed claim however an expired patent is not viewed as having` never existed'
much to the contrary` a patent does have value beyond its expiration date'
in re morgan 990_f.2d_1230 1232 fed.cir.1992
for example an expired patent may form the basis of an action for past damages subject to the six-year limitation under 35 u.s.c.¡± 286
see e.g. id
( recognizing that an action for patent infringement may be filed up to six years after the patents expiration
there is no comparable statute providing any such rights in a disclaimed claim

furthermore the expiration of the ¡¬112_patent does not deprive this ¡± 291 action of meaning
in kimberly-clark corp. v. procter & gamble distributing co. 973_f.2d_911 914 fed.cir.1992 in determining that jurisdiction in a ¡± 291 action existed following the parties settlement of infringement liability issues we noted in support of our holding that` a declaration of priority and the subsequent elimination of an invalid patent that claims the same_subject_matter as claimed in ones patent arerelief under [ ¡± 291 ]'
similar reasoning applies here
genetics points out that the outcome of this ¡± 291 action` will have real-world consequences' because genetics corporate parent wyeth has been sued for allegedly infringing the novartis_patents in a related case in the united_states_district_court for the eastern district of texas
pl.-appellants reply br.at 10 ; see also compl.at 1 novartis_vaccines & diagnostics inc. v. wyeth no._208-cv-067 e.d.tex
feb._15,_2008 ecf no._1
a determination that the ¡¬112_patent interferes with and has priority over the novartis_patents would directly affect the outcome of that infringement suit

we also note an important_distinction between ¡± 291 and the statute governing interferences before the pto 35 u.s.c.¡± 135
whereas an interfering patents_action under ¡± 291 involves two` interfering patents' without qualification a ¡± 135 action in contrast is declared between one pending application and` any pending application or.. any unexpired_patent'
*1300 35 u.s.c.¡± 135 emphasis added
this meaningful difference in statutory language indicates that ¡± 291 unlike ¡± 135 is not limited to` unexpired' patents
that is but one essential difference between these two statutes
compare guinn v. kopf 96_f.3d_1419 1421-22 fed.cir.1996 holding that the disclaimer of an allegedly interfering claim did not divest the pto of jurisdiction over the ¡± 135 interference with albert 729 f.2d at 760-61 holding that the disclaimer of the allegedly interfering claims divested the district_court of jurisdiction over the ¡± 291 interfering patents_action

in view of the substantial differences between a disclaimer and an expiration we decline to extend the holding in albert to patent expiration situations
accordingly we hold that the expiration of the ¡¬112_patent following the district_courts final decision does not strip our court of jurisdiction over the present_appeal

ii
district court jurisdiction
novartis alleges that the district_court lacked jurisdiction to decide whether certain_claims of the ¡¬112_patent and the novartis_patents interfered
novartis argues that claims 1_and_5 of the ¡¬112_patent are not entitled to an extended_term because genetics in its patent_term_extension application under ¡± 156 d 1 identified only claims 9_and_10 of the ¡¬112_patent as relating to its commercial product refactothe_r
because patent_term_extensions apply only on a claim-by-claim_basis novartis argues claims 1_and_5 expired on september 19 2006 following the original seventeen-year patent term
novartis also maintains that because claim 10 as construed by the district_court does not cover refactothe_r it too is ineligible for patent_term_extension under ¡± 156
citing albert 729_f.2d_757 novartis argues that because expired claims can not support an interfering patents_action under ¡± 291 claims 1 5 and 10 of the ¡¬112_patent were not properly before the district_court

genetics argues in response that the district_court correctly held that a patent_term_extension under ¡± 156 applies to the term of the patent as a whole i.e. to all claims in the patent
genetics asserts that the plain_language of ¡± 156 compels this statutory interpretation
genetics further maintains that each of claims 1 5 and 9 covers refactothe_r
specifically genetics argues that because claim 9 of the ¡¬112_patent covers refactothe_r a point conceded by novartis claims 1_and_5 must also cover this commercial product since claim 9 depends from claim 5 which in turn depends from claim 1

we like the district_court genetics 687 f.supp.2d at 497 reject novartiss assertion that a patent_term_extension under ¡± 156 applies on a claim-by-claim_basis
the plain_language of ¡± 156 refutes novartiss argument
the title of this section is` extension of patent term'
35 u.s.c.¡± 156 emphasis added
subsection a dictates that the term of the patent as opposed to specific claim s shall be extended the term of a patent which claims a product a method of using a product or a method of manufacturing a product shall be extended in accordance with this section from the original expiration date of the patent..' ¡± 156 a emphases added

the text of subsection b which sets forth` the rights derived from any patent the term of which is extended under this section' id.¡± 156 b emphasis added is equally clear that ¡± 156 applies to the term of the patent not individual claim s
the restrictions on the` rights derived' set forth in subsection b do not suggest otherwise
subsection b was intended not to restrict the extension to particular_claims but rather to limit the effect of the *1301 extension
id
( stating for example that for patents that claim a product the rights in the extended_term are` limited to any use approved for the product'
as the accompanying 1982 house_report explained` [ i ] f a chemical is subjected to regulatory_review for new_drug_uses but is also marketed for other commercial uses the patent_term_extension would apply only to the new_drug_uses for which regulatory_review was required'
h.r.rep
no._97-696 at 10 1982

thus neither ¡± 156 a nor ¡± 156 b supports novartiss position that ¡± 156 applies only to particular_claims
a patent as a whole is extended even though its effect may be limited to certain of its claims
novartis nonetheless contends that the extension must apply on a claim-by-claim_basis because ¡± 156 d 1 requires an application for a patent_term_extension to identify each claim that claims the approved product or method of using or manufacturing the approved product
35 u.s.c.¡± 156 d 1 b
yet subsection d 1 merely lists the required contents of an application for a patent_term_extension
subsections a and b on the other hand set forth the legal effect of the patent_term_extension itself.6

in sum in light of the plain_language of ¡± 156 and absent any indication that congress intended that the extension should apply only to particular_claims we decline to adopt novartiss arguments

to the extent novartis contends that the restrictions under ¡± 156 b on the rights derived from the extension of the ¡¬112_patent prevented genetics from asserting claims 1 5 and 10 in this ¡± 291 action we also disagree
novartis concedes that claim 9 covers refactothe_r the approved product for which genetics received the patent_term_extension
because claim 9 depends from claims 1_and_5 those claims must also cover refactothe_r
see 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
4
regarding claim 10 novartis incorrectly asserts that` the district_court construed claim 10 as not covering the active ingredient of refactothe_r'
def.-appellees br.at 63
in fact the district_court noted that under its claim construction` refactothe_r may not be encompassed by claim 10'
genetics 687 f.supp.2d at 497_n._14_(emphasis_added)
the court thus did not make a factual finding on the issue of whether claim 10 of the ¡¬112_patent covers refactothe_r and we decline to do so for the first_time on appeal
see sage prods. inc. v. devon indus. inc. 126_f.3d_1420 1426 fed.cir.1997

finally we also reject novartiss related argument that no patent extended under ¡± 156 can form the basis of a ¡± 291 interfering patents_action
the statutory text does not suggest that rights afforded by ¡± 156 are so limited
and as the district_court correctly noted genetics 687 f.supp.2d at 497 the legislative history advises against novartiss interpretation the 1984 house_report discussing the hatch-waxman act provides that` all provisions of the patent_law apply to the patent during the period of extension'

iii
interference in fact
the patent_laws recognize two types of actions involving interfering claims
an` interference' action under 35 u.s.c.¡± 135 can be declared by the pto` [ w ] henever an application is made for a patent which.. would interfere with any *1302 pending application or with any unexpired_patent'
an` interfering patents' action under 35 u.s.c.¡± 291 permits` [ t ] he owner of an interfering patent [ to seek ] relief against the owner of another by civil_action'
this case is an appeal from an interfering patents suit under ¡± 291 to determine the priority of invention between certain issued patents
see slip track sys. inc. v. metal lite inc. 159_f.3d_1337 1341 fed.cir.1998

the first step in a ¡± 291 interfering patents_action is the determination whether an interference in fact exists between claims of the two patents
medichem s.a. v. rolabo s.l. 353_f.3d_928 934 fed.cir.2003
this requires application of a` two-way_test' which as discussed below involves underlying questions of anticipation and obviousness under 35 u.s.c.¡±¡± 102 103
id.at 932
accordingly the standards of review for an interference in fact mirror those of anticipation and obviousness inquiries
id

anticipation and obviousness require the court to compare the properly construed claims to the available prior_art
oakley inc. v. sunglass hut int l 316_f.3d_1331 1339 fed.cir.2003
if` each and every limitation is found either expressly or inherently in a single prior_art_reference' then the claim is invalid under ¡± 102 for anticipation
sanofi-synthelabo v. apotex inc. 470_f.3d_1368 1375 fed.cir.2006 internal_quotation_marks omitted
we review a finding of anticipation for clear_error
zenon envtl. inc. v. u.s. filter corp. 506_f.3d_1370 1377 fed.cir.2007
obviousness under ¡± 103 is a question of law based on underlying factual determinations
oakley 316 f.3d at 1339
we review the legal conclusion of obviousness de novo and the underlying findings of fact for clear_error
id

a
there is no interference in fact between the asserted claims of the ¡¬112_patent and the ¡¬620_patent
genetics argues that the district_court erred by failing to find that an interference in fact existed between the allegedly interfering claims
according to genetics the court erroneously determined that all of the allegedly interfering claims of the novartis_patents require binding to vwf when in fact that is not an explicit claim limitation
moreover genetics asserts the court incorrectly applied the two-way_test in finding no interference in fact

regarding the allegedly interfering claims in the ¡¬112 and ¡¬620_patent_s in particular genetics maintains that the amino_acid deletion claimed by the ¡¬ 620 patent is subsumed entirely by the deletion claimed by the ¡¬112_patent ; thus the ¡¬620_patents claims would have been prima_facie obvious over the allegedly interfering claims of the ¡¬112_patent
genetics further contends that the district_court *1303 misunderstood the testimony of its expert dr. phillip fay who stated that with knowledge of the deletion_points claimed in the ¡¬112_patent i.e. amino_acids 740_and_1690 it would have been obvious to select the deletion_points claimed in the ¡¬620_patent i.e. amino_acids_740_and_1649 because the latter points were known in vivo_cleavage_points of the full-length_factor_viii_protein
genetics does not allege error in the district_courts determination that the ¡¬112_patents claims would not have anticipated the ¡¬620_patents claims
as for the second_leg of the two-way_test genetics contends that the district_court erred by failing to find that the ¡¬620_patents claims anticipate the ¡¬112_patents claims

novartis responds that there is no interference in fact between the allegedly interfering claims of the ¡¬112_patent and the novartis_patents
novartis contends that the two-way_test is not satisfied because the broader_range of deletions permitted by the claims of the ¡¬112_patent does not anticipate or render obvious the narrower_range claimed in the novartis_patents
novartis asserts that only the claimed novartis_proteins retain the a3_region and possess the increased stability associated with vwf binding and even if this increased stability was not known as of the priority_dates of the novartis_patents that property may nonetheless support the claimed proteins non-obviousness
novartis then proceeds on a claim-by-claim_basis to demonstrate why in its view the district_court correctly concluded that the claims of the ¡¬112_patent do not interfere with the claims of the novartis_patents

as we shall explain we agree with the district_courts determinations that 1 claim 1 of the ¡¬112_patent would not have rendered obvious_claim 68 of the ¡¬620_patent ; 2 claim 5 of the ¡¬112_patent would not have rendered obvious_claim 74 of the ¡¬620_patent ; and 3 claim 9 of the ¡¬112_patent would not have rendered obvious_claim 83 of the ¡¬620_patent
we therefore affirm the district_courts conclusion that the two-way_test is not satisfied and that there is no interference in fact between these claims

the district_court started and ultimately ended by examining the first_leg of the two-way_test i.e. whether the claims of the ¡¬112_patent if prior_art would invalidate the claims of the ¡¬620_patent
genetics 687 f.supp.2d at 497-500
the court noted that these claims differ in terms of the nature of the truncated_factor_viii_proteins encoded by the nucleic_acids
id.at 498
the court then proceeded to analyze the differences between the groups of proteins claimed in the two patents

to summarize the district_courts analysis the claimed truncated_factor_viii_proteins in the ¡¬112 and ¡¬620_patent_s differ in terms of the size of the permitted amino_acid_deletions the location of the permitted amino_acid_deletions and the degree of allowable_amino_acid_substitutions
in particular the deletion in claim 1 of the ¡¬112_patent and by extension claims 5_and_9 ranges in size from 581_to_949 amino_acids and is located between amino_acids 740_and_16907 whereas the deletion in claims 68 74 and 83 of the ¡¬620_patent ranges in size from 889_to_909 amino_acids and is located between amino_acids_740_and_1649
the ¡¬620_patents claims permit substitution of up to 10 % of the amino_acids whereas the ¡¬112_patents claims do not
importantly it is undisputed that the ¡¬112_patent permits deletion of amino_acids in the 1649-1689 region whereas the ¡¬620_patent does not

*1304 in view of these structural differences between the proteins claimed in the ¡¬112 and ¡¬620_patent_s the district_court correctly required as part of the prima_facie obviousness inquiry the identification of some reason that would have prompted a researcher to modify the prior_art_compounds in a particular manner to arrive at the claimed compounds

this principle was reaffirmed by the supreme_courts opinion in ksr international co. v. teleflex inc. which acknowledged the importance of identifying` a reason that would have prompted a person of ordinary_skill in the relevant field to combine the elements in the way the claimed new invention does'

the district_court correctly found that genetics failed to establish any such reason for modifying the group of proteins claimed in the ¡¬112_patent to produce the group claimed in the ¡¬620_patent
genetics 687 f.supp.2d at 500
as of the 1986 priority_date of the ¡¬620_patent those of skill in the art understood the inactive_b_domain of the factor_viii_protein to be` essentially delimited by residues 740_and_1689` -i.e. to include the amino_acids in the a3_region

indeed as the district_court noted dr. randal kaufman a former genetics scientist confirmed this fact
during his deposition he stated that in 1986 the 1649-1689 amino_acid region was understood to be part of the b_domain
id

genetics argues that amino_acid 1649 was one of the known in vivo cleavage sites on the factor_viii_protein and on account of this fact it` would be readily apparent' to make a truncated_factor_viii_protein that retained amino_acids in the 1649-1689 region contrary to the teachings of the ¡¬112_patent
br
of pl.-appellant at 35
in support of its position genetics cites two articles published in 1984 that disclosed a number of in vivo cleavage cites on the factor_viii_protein
j.a
5181-86 5195-200 ; see also j.a
3781-83
yet genetics concedes that it was not known prior to the filing of the ¡¬620_patent that amino_acids 1649-1689 were critical to maintain vwf binding
br
of pl.-appellant at 35
and genetics offers no basis for its assertion that the mere_existence of in vivo_cleavage_points between particular amino_acid_residues would have provided one of ordinary_skill with a reason or motivation to make the particular truncated proteins claimed in the ¡¬620_patent
genetics 687 f.supp.2d at 500

indeed those same in vivo cleavage sites were known as of the 1985 priority_date of the ¡¬112_patent but the proteins claimed in the ¡¬112_patent do not require retention of amino_acids 1649-1689
that indicates the weakness of genetics position *1305 and supports the district_courts conclusion that mere knowledge of in vivo cleavage sites on factor_viii would not have provided a sufficient reason for making the proteins claimed in the ¡¬620_patent
id

genetics arguments also run contrary to the research objectives of those in the field of truncated_factor_viii_proteins
the district_court found that research in the factor_viii field focused on` finding a smaller recombinant_protein that mimicked the biological_activity of factor_viii in humans'
id.at 492 emphasis added
that is consistent with the disclosure of the ¡¬112_patent which is focused on making` proteins which have procoagulant_activity similar to that of factor viii c and also have substantially lower_molecular_weight'
¡¬112_patent col.2 ll.10-13 ; see also id
col.20 ll.9-14` i contemplate that my compounds may be produced by recombinant_dna techniques at a much lower_cost than is possible for production of human factor viii
the host organisms should more efficiently process and express the substantially simpler_molecules of this invention'
( emphasis added
genetics fails to explain why with knowledge of the claimed range of proteins in the ¡¬112_patent one of ordinary_skill would have sought out a range encompassing larger recombinant_proteins i.e. proteins having smaller amino_acid_deletions such as the range of proteins claimed in the ¡¬620_patent
thus contrary to genetics arguments the mere_existence of an in vivo cleavage point without more would not have provided the requisite` reason or motivation' dillon 919 f.2d at 692 to manipulate the claimed proteins of the ¡¬112_patent at that cleavage point to make those claimed in the ¡¬620_patent

the dissent in arguing for obviousness relies on those claimed proteins of the ¡¬112_patent that retain the a3_region
dissent_op.at 1314-15
but the dissent selectively parses the prior_art disclosure with impermissible hindsight
each disputed claim of the ¡¬112_patent teaches deletion of the a3_region in some variants thus leading away from a requirement that that region be retained
viewed as a whole the prior_art would not have prompted one of ordinary_skill to require retention of the a3_region
see panduit corp. v. dennison mfg co. 810_f.2d_1561 1568 fed.cir.1987` [ a ] prior patent must be considered in its entirety i.e. as a whole including portions that would lead away from the invention in suit [
]'

further the dissent challenges well-established law requiring the identification of some reason that would have prompted a researcher to substantially modify a prior_art_compound to produce the claimed compound
dissent_op.at 1311-13
while the dissent accepts that the prior_art here provided` no suggestion or stated need for further_experimentation' and` no motivation to optimize for some value within the range' of proteins disclosed by the ¡¬112_patent id.at 1314 the dissent nonetheless contends that because of` structural_similarity' in the patented proteins no reason for chemical_modification need be shown
the dissent vastly oversimplifies the differences in the claimed proteins however
one of ordinary_skill would appreciate that the claimed truncated proteins vary enormously in structure for example the a3_region alone contains 40 amino_acid_residues and has a relative molecular mass of about 4,500
j.a
5199
in contrast the homologs analogs and isomers referenced by the dissent typically differ at most by only a few atoms-and even in cases involving such ostensibly minor chemical differences prima_facie obviousness is by no means inevitable
see e.g. grabiak 769 f.2d at 730 reversing the ptos finding of prima_facie obviousness even though the prior_art_compound differed from the claimed compound` only by the presence *1306.. of a sulfur atom instead of a particular oxygen atom'
the dissents oversimplification violates our longstanding admonition that` generalization is to be avoided insofar as specific structures are alleged to be prima_facie obvious one from the other'
in re jones 958_f.2d_347 350 fed.cir.1992 citing grabiak 769 f.2d at 731
on the facts of this case the nontrivial differences in the proteins at issue compel the requirement of identifying a reason for the chemical_modification

genetics asserts that the district_courts conclusion of nonobviousness is contrary to in re_peterson 315_f.3d_1325_(fed.cir.2003)
according to genetics peterson holds that a broad range necessarily renders obvious a narrower_range falling within that broader_range
that is incorrect
in peterson we stated that` [ a ] prima_facie_case of obviousness typically exists when the ranges of a claimed composition overlap the ranges disclosed in the prior_art'
id.at 1329 emphasis added
the facts here do not present the` typical [ ]' case contemplated in peterson however

first we noted in peterson that` we do not have here any assertion that the disclosed range is so broad as to encompass a very large_number of possible_distinct_compositions' and that our reasoning did not necessarily extend to` a disclosed range of such_breadth'
id.at 1330_n._1
in this case in contrast about 68,000 protein_variants are encompassed by the claims of the ¡¬112_patent
genetics 687 f.supp.2d at 498
genetics fails to acknowledge this important_distinction

moreover in peterson our holding was based on the recognition that` [ t ] he normal desire of scientists or artisans to improve upon what is already generally known provides the motivation to determine where in a disclosed set of percentage ranges is the optimum_combination of percentages'
315 f.3d at 1330
as noted above however the only_evidence of motivation in the present_record is that of researchers to make smaller truncated proteins to solve the cloning difficulties associated with the large_size of factor_viii
that motivation would not have supplied researchers with a reason to make the group of proteins claimed in the ¡¬620_patent encompassing larger truncated proteins than those claimed in the ¡¬112_patent
simply put the typical_desire of scientists to find an optimum_value within a narrow disclosed range id. does not apply to the facts of this case

the dissent also attempts to shoehorn the facts of this case into our holding in peterson
but the novartis_inventors did not simply` [ s ] elect [ ] a narrow range from within a somewhat broader_range' as did the peterson inventors when selecting the range of` about 1-3 %' rhenium from the prior_art_range of` 0-7 %' rhenium
peterson 315 f.3d at 1329-30
as noted the ¡¬ 112 patent contains 68,000 truncated variants of a protein made up of 2,332 amino_acids and the allegedly interfering inventions differ in terms of the size of the permitted amino_acid_deletions the location of those deletions and the degree of allowable_amino_acid_substitutions
the facts here present a case where the` disclosed range is so broad as to encompass a very large_number of possible_distinct_compositions' thus` requir [ ing ] nonobvious_invention' not a case as in peterson where prior_art` ranges that are not especially broad invite routine_experimentation to discover optimum_values'
id.at 1330_n._1
on this point the dissent appears to agree conceding not only that the prior_art ¡¬112_patent claims a` large_breadth of possible_protein_variants' but also that` there was no motivation to optimize for some value within the range' disclosed by prior_art
dissent_op.at 1314
viewed in context our holding in peterson does not extend to the facts of this case

*1307 we therefore hold that the district_court did not err in concluding that the ¡¬620_patents claims would not have been prima_facie obvious over the ¡¬112_patents claims

we also reject genetics contention that the district_court erred by crediting the unexpected_results of the claimed invention in the ¡¬620_patent as part of its obviousness analysis
genetics maintains that because the importance of the a3_region to vwf binding was not known as of the filing_date of the ¡¬620_patent the retention of the a3_region in the claimed proteins of the ¡¬620_patent and their corresponding ability to bind vwf may not be relied upon to demonstrate the unexpected_results of those proteins
we disagree
our case_law is clear that the structure of a claimed compound and its properties are inseparable for purposes of ¡± 103
sanofi-synthelabo v. apotex inc. 550_f.3d_1075 1086 fed.cir.2008` for chemical_compounds the structure of the compound and its properties are inseparable_considerations in the obviousness_determination
`` ; in re papesch 50_ccpa_1084 315_f.2d_381 391 1963` from the standpoint of patent_law a compound and all of its properties are inseparable ; they are one and the same_thing
``

our law is equally clear that every property of a claimed compound need not be fully recognized as of the filing_date of the patent_application to be relevant to nonobviousness
knoll pharm co. v. teva pharms
usa inc. 367_f.3d_1381 1385 fed.cir.2004` there is no requirement that an inventions properties and advantages were fully known before the patent_application was filed or that the patent_application contains all of the work done in studying the invention in order for that work to be introduced into evidence in response to litigation attack`
for those reasons we have held that evidence of unexpected_results may be used to rebut a case of prima_facie obviousness even if that evidence was obtained after the patents filing or issue date
id
(` evidence [ of unexpected_results ] developed after the patent grant is not excluded from consideration for understanding of the full_range of an invention is not always achieved at the time of filing the patent_application
`` ; in re khelghatian 53_ccpa_1441 364_f.2d_870 876 1966 holding the claimed invention nonobvious in view of post-filing evidence of an unexpected property not disclosed in the specification while noting that the evidence` [ wa ] s directed to that whichwould inherently flow from what was originally disclosed' quoting in re_zenitz 52_ccpa_746 333_f.2d_924 927 1964 ; see also eli_lilly & co. v. zenith goldline pharms. inc. 471_f.3d_1369 1378 fed.cir.2006` this court will not ignore a relevant property of a compound in the obviousness calculus'
( citing lalu 747 f.2d at 707

the dissent like genetics misstates our precedent regarding secondary considerations of nonobviousness
dissent_op.at 1315-18
although the ¡± 103 analysis remains properly focused` at the time the invention was made' it would be error to prohibit a patent_applicant or patentee from presenting relevant indicia of nonobviousness whether or not this evidence was available or expressly contemplated at the filing of the patent_application
see graham v. john_deere_co. 383_u.s._1 17-18 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966)
relevant secondary considerations often are not manifest even until well after the issuance of a patent
the dissent would require either an express prediction of unexpected_properties in the patent specification or a showing of the inventors contemporaneous knowledge of such properties before the pto or any court could consider such probative evidence
our precedent contains no such requirement
see e.g. *1308 in re chu 66_f.3d_292 298-99 fed.cir.1995 noting that evidence supporting nonobviousness need not be contained within the specification and holding that the pto erred by failing to consider unexpected_results even though the specification was` virtually silent on the matter' ; see also ksr 550 u.s. at 406 127_s.ct._1727` the analysis is objective [ ]'
even so the dissents supposed requirement is an incorrect basis for rejecting the evidence in this case where the patents expressly disclose the claimed proteins high stability and ability to bind vwf e.g. ¡¬447_patent col.2 ll.29-31 col.8 ll.19-22 ; ¡¬ 620 patent col.2 ll.30-32 col.8 ll.25-29 and where the parties do not dispute that the novartis_inventors development of the claimed proteins used a technique that excluded any protein that did not bind vwf j.a
3707-08

consequently the district_court did not err in its nonobviousness_analysis by considering as evidence of unexpected_results the ability of the claimed proteins to bind vwf even if as genetics contends the role of the a3_region was not appreciated as of the ¡¬620_patents priority_date
genetics 687 f.supp.2d at 500

genetics alleges yet another error in the district_courts nonobviousness_determination
genetics contends that novartiss proffered unexpected_results are not commensurate with the full_scope of its claims because the novartis_patents permit amino_acid substitution that may reduce or eliminate vwf binding
again we disagree
whether an invention has produced unexpected_results is a question of fact in re harris 409_f.3d_1339 1341 fed.cir.2005 and we do not perceive clear_error in the district_courts decision to credit novartiss evidence of vwf binding
the district_court explicitly recognized that the claims of the novartis_patents permit substitution i.e. replacement of one amino_acid with another in up to 10 % of the proteins amino_acids
genetics 687 f.supp.2d at 499 501
notwithstanding that finding genetics points to an article published by leyte in 1991 demonstrating that the substitution of the amino_acid phenylalanine for tyrosine at position 1680 in the a3_region eliminated vwf binding but retained procoagulant_activity in the resulting b-domain deleted protein
see anja_leyte_et_al. sulfation of tyr 1680 of human_blood_coagulation_factor_viii is essential for the interaction of factor_viii with von_willebrand_factor 266 j
biological_chem
740 744 1991 ; j.a
6084-90
based on this information genetics asserts that the unexpected_result of improved stability through vwf binding is not commensurate in scope with the claims of the ¡¬620_patent and therefore must be ignored

the district_courts opinion did not explicitly address the leyte_article
even taking genetics assertions as true however the leyte_article demonstrates at most that one particular amino_acid substitution at one particular position eliminates vwf binding-in a claimed truncated protein of between 1 424_and_1444 total amino_acids
this solitary fact does not undermine the district_courts decision to credit the vwf binding properties of the proteins claimed in the novartis_patents-properties that genetics itself concedes are possessed by truncated_factor_viii_proteins retaining the a3_region

while we have held that unexpected_results must be commensurate in scope with the claims we have not required absolute_identity of scope ; rather we have rejected unexpected_results where the evidence was plainly disproportionate to the scope of the claim
see e.g. peterson 315 f.3d at 1331 affirming obviousness where the applicant claimed an alloy with 1-3 %_rhenium yet presented unexpected_results only for 2 %_rhenium and evidence suggested that 3 %_rhenium possessed inferior properties ; in *1309 re grasselli 713_f.2d_731 743 fed.cir.1983 concluding that unexpected_results` limited to sodium only' were not commensurate in scope with claims to a catalyst having` an alkali metal' ; in re greenfield 571_f.2d_1185 1189 ccpa 1978 affirming the obviousness of a genus containing` several hundred compounds' where unexpected_results were proved for` only one' such compound ; cf
in re glatt air techniques inc. 630_f.3d_1026 1030 fed.cir.2011 stating that objective evidence of commercial_success relating` only to a single embodiment' should be considered even if claim covers` multiple embodiments'
indeed a rigid requirement of absolute_identity that ignores relevant properties of claimed compounds would defy the mandate of ¡± 103 requiring consideration of the claimed` subject_matter as a whole'
on the facts of this case it was not improper for the district_court in its nonobviousness_analysis to weigh novartiss proffered evidence of unexpected_results

because on appeal genetics challenges only the district_courts conclusion of nonobviousness we need not review the courts determination that the ¡¬112_patents claims would not if prior_art anticipate the ¡¬620_patents claims genetics 687 f.supp.2d at 499
in view of our conclusion that the claims of the ¡¬112_patent would not invalidate the claimed subject_matter of the ¡¬620_patent we also need not consider whether the reverse is true
because the two-way_test was not met we conclude that the district_court did not err in holding that there was no interference in fact between claims 68 74 and 83 of the ¡¬620_patent and claims 1 5 and 9 of the ¡¬112_patent respectively

b
there is no interference in fact between the asserted claims of the ¡¬112_patent and the ¡¬447_patent
genetics maintains that the district_court erred by finding no interference in fact between the allegedly interfering claims of the ¡¬112 and ¡¬447_patent s. genetics argues in general that the court committed the same errors as with the allegedly interfering claims of the ¡¬112 and ¡¬620_patent_s. as explained above we reject those arguments

regarding claim 9 of the ¡¬112_patent and claim 1 of the ¡¬447_patent genetics additionally asserts that it would have been obvious to use the method of claim 9 to make the composition of claim 1 because there is no patentable_distinction between a method of making a protein and the protein itself
we need not address this argument however because it is premised on genetics flawed assertion the basis for which we rejected above that the court erred by finding a patentable_distinction between the proteins of claim 9 of the ¡¬ 112 patent and those of claim 1 of the ¡¬447_patent
genetics does not contend on appeal that claim 9 of the ¡¬112_patent would anticipate claim 1 of the ¡¬447_patent
accordingly at least the first_leg of the two-way_test fails for the alleged interference in fact between claim 9 of the ¡¬112_patent and claim 1 of the ¡¬447_patent
genetics 687 f.supp.2d at 501

regarding claim 10 of the ¡¬112_patent and claim 1 of the ¡¬447_patent genetics contends that the district_court erred because each claim as prior_art would render the other obvious
we disagree
taking claim 1 of the ¡¬447_patent as prior_art to claim 10 of the ¡¬112_patent genetics again asserts that` it would be readily apparent' to one of ordinary_skill in the art to modify the protein of claim 1 of the ¡¬447_patent to make the three proteins of claim 10 of the ¡¬112_patent
br
of pl.-appellant at 43
as an initial matter genetics which describes the necessary modifications as` smaller_deletions' id. misconstrues the scope of claim 10
as the district_court correctly determined *1310 whereas claim 1 of the ¡¬447_patent deletes the complete b_domain 909 amino_acids claim 10 of the ¡¬112_patent claims three specific proteins two of which have smaller_deletions 581_and_880 amino_acids and one of which has a larger_deletion 915 amino_acids than the b_domain
genetics 687 f.supp.2d at 501
the larger_deletion ranges from amino_acid 759_to_1675 which includes part of the a3_acidic_region

as the district_court noted genetics failed to present evidence showing why one of ordinary_skill would modify the protein of claim 1 of the ¡¬ 447 patent to make the three different proteins of claim 10 of the ¡¬112_patent
id.at 502
genetics alleges that obviousness of a chemical_compound does not require evidence of some reason for modification
as we explained above however this reflects a misunderstanding of the law
moreover genetics position is belied by the testimony of debra pittman a genetics scientist who worked with toole on factor_viii_proteins
as explained by pittman a researcher intent on designing a new truncated_factor_viii_protein would first identify the amino_acid regions he or she wished to delete and only then would consider particular protein design strategies q
what steps were involved in going about making the deletion variants of factor_viii that dr. toole had in mind ?
a
well first was to identify the regions that he wanted to delete and then devising a scheme to make those deletions using either restriction sites or oligonucleotides
j.a
3612 emphases added
common sense dictates that` want [ ing ] to delete' a particular amino_acid region implies that a reason must exist for that deletion
pittmans testimony thus corroborates what our case_law requires for proving that a claimed compound would have been obvious the identification of some reason why one of ordinary_skill would make the necessary chemical_modifications to arrive at the claimed compound
takeda 492 f.3d at 1357 ; dillon 919 f.2d at 692

we therefore affirm the district_courts conclusion that claim 1 of the ¡¬ 447 patent would not have rendered obvious_claim 10 of the ¡¬112_patent
moreover genetics does not contend that claim 1 would have anticipated claim 10
because one leg of the two-way_test fails we need not consider the second_leg
medichem 353 f.3d at 935

accordingly we agree with the district_courts determinations that there is no interference in fact between claims 9_and_10 of the ¡¬112_patent and claim 1 of the ¡¬447_patent

conclusion
for the foregoing reasons we affirm the district_courts order granting novartiss motion to dismiss due to the absence of an interference in fact between the allegedly interfering claims
in particular we conclude that the expiration of the ¡¬112_patent following the district_courts entry of final_judgment did not divest our court of appellate_jurisdiction ; that the patent_term_extension of the ¡¬112_patent applied to all of the allegedly interfering claims ; and that there is no interference in fact between 1 claim 1 of the ¡¬112_patent and claim 68 of the ¡¬620_patent 2 claim 5 of the ¡¬112_patent and claim 74 of the ¡¬620_patent 3 claim 9 of the ¡¬ 112 patent and claim 83 of the ¡¬620_patent and 4 claims 9_and_10 of the ¡¬112_patent and claim 1 of the ¡¬447_patent

affirmed

dyk circuit_judge concurring-in-part and dissenting-in-part
i join parts i and ii of the majoritys opinion but i respectfully dissent from part iii
in my view the majority erred in holding that the asserted claims of the ¡¬ *1311 112 patent would not render obvious the asserted claims of the ¡¬620 and ¡¬447_patent s collectively the` novartis_patents' and in holding that there was accordingly no interference-in-fact

in the mid-1980s the ¡¬112_patent and the novartis_patents were co-pending before the patent and trademark_office` pto'
at the time there was concern that pathogens like the hiv and hepatitis virus were contaminating the supply of hemophilia treatments made from human_factor_viii_proteins
genetics and novartis thus competed to clone safer synthetic forms of factor_viii
because of the large_size of factor_viii however yields from the host_cells expressing the gene were very low
the patents-in-suit were directed to solving this problem by producing truncated forms of factor_viii that would nonetheless maintain the same procoagulant i.e
blood-clotting activity of the full-length protein

by comparing human_factor_viii to porcine_factor_viii genetics discovered that while significant regions of human and porcine_factor_viii were homologous the large b_domain of human_factor_viii diverged greatly from the b_domain of porcine_factor_viii
because porcine_factor_viii was nonetheless effective in treating human hemophilia patients genetics deduced that the b_domain was superfluous and could be excised without compromising factor_viiis procoagulant_activity
this discovery led to the innovations of the ¡¬112_patent
the truncated_factor_viii_proteins of the ¡¬112_patent have a` substantially lower_molecular_weight' ¡¬112_patent col.2 ll.10-12 but have` similar procoagulant_activity' to the full-length version of human_factor_viii id
col.1 ll.8-9
these` simpler_molecules' were advantageous because they could` be produced.. at a much lower_cost'
id
col.20 ll.9-14
around the same time novartis scientists were researching a more efficient way to clone_factor_viii
the objective of the novartis_patents was similarly to design a truncated protein with` activity equal to that of cloned full-length factor_viii [ ]'
¡¬447_patent col.2 ll.18-19 ; ¡¬620_patent col.2 ll.18-19

all of the patents-in-suit are directed to truncated_factor_viii_proteins in which the b_domain is either partially or completely deleted
these proteins differ mainly in one respect while the novartis_proteins retain the a3_region the proteins of the ¡¬112_patent permit but do not require deletions in that region
as it turned out years later independent researchers discovered that the a3_region had the previously unforeseen benefit of being able to bind to von_willebrand_factor` vwf'
though it had been known since the late 1970s that vwf had a stabilizing effect on factor_viii the location of vwf binding in the a3_region was not known until at least 1988 years after the novartis_patents were filed as the novartis witnesses themselves described
one novartis expert admitted that there was` nothing in the scientific literature by april 1986 suggesting the importance of [ the a3_region ] to interactions between factor_viii and vwf'
j.a
2683
and one of the inventors testified that the novartis_patents` do [ ] not specifically tell you [ the location of the vwf binding sites within the factor_viii_protein ] [ because ] that was not the intention of the patent to specify the binding to von_willebrand_factor'
j.a
3732
the majority does not dispute this stating that` genetics concedes that it was not known prior to the filing of the ¡¬620_patent that [ the a3_region ] was critical to maintain vwf binding'
maj. op.at 1304

in my view there are four fundamental flaws with the majoritys conclusion of non-obviousness
first the majority holds that the novartis_patents could not be *1312 obvious over the ¡¬112_patent unless genetics could identify` some reason that would have prompted a researcher to modify' the ¡¬112_patent to retain the a3_region
id.at 1303
however a requirement for a motivation to retain the a3_region should not be the test where from an objective standpoint no inventor-including the novartis_inventors themselves-could have been aware of the benefits of retaining the a3_region at the time of the invention
rather we should look to whether there was enough structural_similarity between the patents-in-suit to make a prima_facie_case of obviousness given what was known to the inventors at the time of the invention

our precedent has established that` [ s ] tructural relationships may provide the requisite_motivation or suggestion to modify known compounds to obtain new compounds'
in re deuel 51_f.3d_1552 1558 fed.cir.1995
moreover such structural_similarity i.e. an established structural relationship between a prior_art_compound and the claimed compound can give rise to a case of prima_facie obviousness
id
thus` a known compound may suggest its [ homologs ] analogs or isomers' because such compounds` often have similar properties and therefore chemists of ordinary_skill would ordinarily contemplate making them to try to obtain compounds with improved properties'
id
in in re jones 958_f.2d_347 349 fed.cir.1992 we acknowledged that` particular types or categories of structural_similarity [ ] without more [ ] have in past cases given rise to prima_facie obviousness'
( citing in re dillon 919_f.2d_688 692-94 fed.cir.1990 tri-orthoesters and tetra-orthoesters cert
denied 500_u.s._904 111_s.ct._1682 114_l.ed.2d_77_(1991) ; in re may 574_f.2d_1082_(ccpa_1978) stereoisomers ; in re wilder 563_f.2d_457_(ccpa_1977) adjacent homologs and structural isomers ; in re hoch 57_ccpa_1292 428_f.2d_1341_(1970) acid and ethyl ester1 in this case the truncated_factor_viii_proteins of the ¡¬112_patent and the truncated_factor_viii_proteins of the novartis_patents are not merely homologs analogs or isomers-they are all variants of the exact same protein exhibiting the exact same procoagulant functions
here the majority found that the patents-in-suit differed in terms of the size of the permitted amino_acid_deletions the location of the deletions and the degree of allowable_amino_acid_substitutions
however these differences are of no consequence to the core procoagulation function of the proteins
this is so because the main innovation of the patents-in-suit is the discovery that the b_domain is completely unnecessary to procoagulation
consequently it does not matter whether the deletions are large or small or whether the deletions begin at one amino_acid or another
any deletion in the b_domain ipso facto would retain the procoagulation function of factor_viii
the similarities in structure and function would provide the requisite_motivation to modify the proteins of the ¡¬ 112 patent to obtain the proteins of the novartis_proteins
see in re dillon 919_f.2d_688 696` [ t ] he fact that the claimed and the prior_art_compounds possessed the same activity *1313 were added factors in the establishment of a prima_facie_case
``

second under our prior authority a prima_facie_case of obviousness can also exist if the range of an earlier patent incorporates the range of later patents.2 that is the case here where it is clear that the range of retentions in the ¡¬112_patent fall within the range of retentions of the novartis_patents as discussed above
our case_law has held that` [ a ] prima_facie_case of obviousness typically exists when the ranges of a claimed composition overlap the ranges disclosed in the prior_art'
in re_peterson 315_f.3d_1325 1329-30 fed.cir.2003
`` [ e ] ven a slight overlap in range establishes a prima_facie_case of obviousness'
id.at 1329 ; see also in re geisler 116_f.3d_1465 1469 fed.cir.1997 finding prima_facie obviousness where range of prior_art_reference 100-600 angstroms overlapped the claimed range 50-100 angstroms ; in re woodruff 919_f.2d_1575 1578 fed.cir.1990 holding a claimed invention obvious because claimed range` more than 5 % to about 25 %' carbon_monoxide abutted range of prior_art` about 1-5 %' carbon_monoxide ; in re malagari 499_f.2d_1297 1303 ccpa 1974 finding prima_facie obviousness where the claimed range of the prior_art_reference 0.020-0.035 %_carbon overlapped the claimed range 0.030-0.070 %_carbon
significantly when` the claimed ranges are completely encompassed by the prior_art the conclusion [ of obviousness ] is even more compelling than in cases of mere overlap'
peterson 315 f.3d at 1330.3 here as in peterson the range of retentions or deletions in the novartis_patents overlap significantly with the range of the ¡¬112_patent and are in my view prima_facie obvious

the majority nevertheless concludes that the compound here was not the`typical [ ] case' contemplated in peterson maj. op.at 1306 quoting 315 f.3d at 1329 pointing to a footnote in peterson that opined although ranges that are not especially broad invite routine_experimentation to discover optimum_values rather than require nonobvious_invention we do not have here any assertion that the disclosed range is so broad as to encompass a very large_number of possible_distinct_compositions
we thus do not need to decide whether a disclosed range of such_breadth might present a situation analogous to our cases involving the failure of a very broad disclosed genus of substances to render prima_facie obvious specific substances within its scope
315 f.3d at 1330_n._1 emphases added
because the majority found that the ¡¬112_patent claims encompassed a very large *1314 number of possible_distinct_compositions-nearly` 68,000 truncated variants' -it declined to extend the reasoning in peterson to a` disclosed range of such_breadth'
maj. op.at 1306

however as the court in peterson made clear it is the facts of a particular case that will render it` typical' or not
315 f.3d at 1329
an expansive range of variants should not per se defeat a prima_facie_case of obviousness
moreover the courts concern in peterson was less the breadth of the claims than the ability to conduct` routine_experimentation to discover optimum_values'
id.at 1330_n._1
narrower ranges would presumably invite more routine_experimentation and` motivate [ ] [ scientists ] to determine where in a disclosed set of.. ranges is the optimum_combination' see id.at 1330 while broader_ranges would presumably discourage such experimentation
here there is no suggestion or stated need for further_experimentation to discover some` optimum range'
as the majority acknowledges the` typical_desire of scientists to find an optimum_value within a narrow disclosed range does not apply to the facts of this case` because` the only_evidence of motivation in the present_record is that of researchers [ trying ] to make smaller truncated proteins to solve the cloning difficulties associated with the large_size of factor_viii'
maj. op.at 1306 emphasis added ; internal_citations omitted
because there was no motivation to optimize for some value within the range of possible retentions the large_breadth of possible_protein_variants is of no consequence
in sum i would find that the claims of the novartis_patents are prima_facie obvious in view of the overlapping ranges of the ¡¬112_patent
the burden of proving nonobviousness should thus have shifted to the holder of the later-developed patent in this case novartis
peterson 315 f.3d at 1330

third the majority appears to suggest that the` ret [ ention ] of amino_acids in the [ a3 ] region' was` contrary to the teachings of the ¡¬112_patent'
maj. op.at 1304
this is wrong on the facts
the majority ignores that some variants of the ¡¬112_patent actually retain the a3_region and therefore have the ability to bind to vwf
for instance claim 10 of the ¡¬ 112 patent claims a truncated_factor_viii_protein having one of three specific_deletions two of which are the deletions of amino_acids 981-big_token__1563_and_759__big_token -1640
see col.26 ll.28-34
these two deletions clearly retain the a3_region amino_acids 1649-1689
retention of the a3_region is also within the scope of retentions allowed by claim 1 of the ¡¬112_patent4 therefore many of the variants claimed in the ¡¬112_patent actually conserve the a3_region necessary for vwf binding
if as the majority concludes` the structure of a claimed compound and its properties are inseparable for purposes of ¡± 103' it seems inconsistent to credit the a3_region in the novartis compounds for giving rise to vwf binding while not doing the same for the compounds of the ¡¬112_patent
maj. op.at 1307 citing sanofi-synthelabo v. apotex inc. 550_f.3d_1075 1086 fed.cir.2008` for chemical_compounds the structure of the compound and its properties are inseparable_considerations in the obviousness_determination
`` ; in re papesch 50_ccpa_1084 315_f.2d_381 391 1963` from the standpoint of patent_law a compound and all of its properties are inseparable ; they are one and the same_thing
``

the majority also urges that some variants of the ¡¬112_patent teach away from retaining the a3_region
the majority however ignores the fact that certain variants *1315 of the novartis_patents also teach away from keeping the a3_region intact with the result that vwf binding is not achieved
in particular the novartis_patents allow up to 10 percent of the amino_acids in the factor_viii_protein to be substituted including substitutions in the a3_region [ u ] sually not more than 10 more usually not more than 5 [ % ] preferably not more than about 1 [ % ] of the amino_acids in the chains will differ from the amino_acids naturally present in the factor_viii [ ].. c_domain [ ].. conservative substitutions include.. phe [ nylalanine ] ¡ö ¡÷ tr [ yptophan ] ¡ö ¡÷ tyr [ osine ]
¡¬620_patent col.4 ll.39-53
with the substitution of phenylalanine for tyrosine in the a3_region-that is a` conservative substitution' expressly taught in the novartis_patents-vwf binding would be` completely abolished'
see anja_leyte_et_al. sulfation of tyr-1680 of human_blood_coagulation_factor_viii is essential for the interaction of factor_viii with von_willebrand_factor 266 j
biological_chem
740 744 1991 available at j.a
6084-90` vwf binding was completely abolished' when` tyr [ osine ] -1680 [ in the a3_region ].. was replaced by phenylalanine`
in this respect the ¡¬112_patent and the novartis_patents all teach some variants that retain the a3_region and some variants that teach away from retaining the a3_region necessary for vwf binding

finally the majority found that the later-discovered undisclosed benefits of retaining the a3_region qualified as unexpected_results to help defeat the prima_facie_case of obviousness even though the role of the a3_region was not appreciated as of the novartis_patents priority_date
i disagree
the majoritys finding of nonobviousness is based entirely on hindsight and happenstance and not on what the inventors knew at the time the novartis_patents were filed
see 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a stating that an invention can not be patented if` the subject_matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made` emphasis added
the supreme_court has never suggested that it is permissible to look beyond the inventors knowledge at the time of patent_filing in determining unexpected_results
to the contrary the supreme_court has characterized such after-acquired knowledge as an` afterthought' ball & socket fastener co. v. kraetzer 150_u.s._111 117 116-17 14_s.ct._48 37_l.ed._1019_(1893) and has declined to give it weight in determining patent validity
for example in graham v. john_deere_co. 383_u.s._1 25 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966) the supreme_court rejected the patentees argument that his patented plow had the unexpected_result of additional` flex' over the prior_art noting that` [ n ] oflexing argument was raised in the patent office'
see also lincoln eng¡¬g co. v. stewart-warner corp. 303_u.s._545 550 58_s.ct._662 82_l.ed._1008_(1938)` if this [ new feature ] were so vital an element.. it is strange that all mention of it was omitted [ in the specification ]
``

similarly our court and our predecessor_court have rejected later-acquired knowledge as supporting unexpected_results
early cases from the court of customs and patent_appeals` ccpa' have gone so far as to hold that unexpected_results must be described in the specification itself.5 contrary to the majoritys suggestion *1316 maj. op.at 1308 i do not propose such a stringent requirement
but i do think that unexpected_properties must either be set forth in the specification or contemporaneously known to the inventors rather than being discovered long after the fact

in more recent ccpa cases the court has suggested that a new undisclosed feature must` inherently flow from the indicated use` of the invention
in re_zenitz 52_ccpa_746 333_f.2d_924 927 1964 emphasis added ; see also in re khelghatian 53_ccpa_1441 364_f.2d_870 876 1966 allowing an unexpected_result to overcome an obviousness rejection where the improved result`inherently flow [ ed ] from what was originally disclosed [ in the patent_application ]' emphasis added
here the sole` indicated use' of the truncated_factor_viii_proteins was the ability to procoagulate blood-not the ability to bind to vwf
in fact the parties do not dispute that the proteins ability to procoagulate blood was completely independent of its ability to bind to vwf
thus the ability to bind to vwf was a wholly new and undisclosed function that did not` inherently flow from the indicated use` of the invention-the procoagulation of blood
see zenitz 333 f.2d at 927
this later-discovered advantage should not have been allowed to defeat a finding of obviousness

nonetheless the majority concludes that sanofi 550 f.3d at 1086 knoll pharmaceutical co. v. teva pharmaceuticals usa inc. 367_f.3d_1381 1385 fed.cir.2004 and papesch 315 f.2d at 391 support its decision to ignore that the inventors here knew nothing about the benefits of retaining the a3_region at the time its patents were filed
however sanofi knoll and papesch are quite different
in contrast to the present case in each of these cases it was shown that as of the time of the invention the inventor had contemplated that a particular claimed structure would confer a special and unanticipated advantage even if the full_scope of that advantage was unknown
while it may have been known at the time of the novartis_patent that binding to vwf helped increase the stability of factor_viii there was no indication that the structure proposed in the novartis_patent i.e. the retention of the a3_region was any more effective in doing this than the structure of the ¡¬112_patent
nor were the differences in the novartis_patents designed to achieve any such objective

in sanofi we affirmed the district_courts holding that the unpredictable and unusual properties of a claimed structure and the therapeutic advantages provided by that structure weighed in favor of nonobviousness
550 f.3d at 1090
unlike the prior_art the claimed compound` provide [ d ] all of the antiplatelet activity and none of the adverse neurotoxicity' of the prior_art
id.at 1087
at the time of the invention it was known that scientists were` seeking optimum anti-platelet aggregation properties with minimal undesirable effects'
id.at 1079
thus it was clear that the evidence of unexpected_results was based on the knowledge of what the inventor wanted to achieve at the time of the invention

*1317 in knoll the district_court refused to consider evidence showing the greater analgesic effect of a combination of drugs over the prior_art concluding that` the unexpected benefits or results were discovered after the.. patent had been issued'
367 f.3d at 1384 internal_quotation_marks omitted
we reversed finding that` [ c ] ontrary to the district_courts perception the specification expressly acknowledge [ d ] that the efficacy of the combination [ was ]surprising` and stated that the combination of the drugs obtained` an analgesic effect greater than that obtained by increasing the dose of either [ analgesic ] alone'
id
to demonstrate the unexpected activity of the claimed combination the patentee submitted additional data from experiments conducted after the patent had been filed
id.at 1385
in concluding that the district_court erred in rejecting this after-acquired data we simply held that it was` not improper to obtain additional support consistent with the patented invention' because` understanding of the full_range of an invention [ was ] not always achieved at the time of filing the patent_application'
id.at 1385 emphases added
thus where there was already support showing that the inventor contemplated the unexpected_result at the time the patent was filed it was not improper to supplement this evidence of unexpected_results with evidence obtained at a later_time
knoll is therefore consistent with a requirement that unexpected_results be tied to what the inventor knew at the time of the invention

in papesch the board of patent_appeals and interferences` board' had rejected the claims for a chemical_compound containing three ethyl groups as obvious over prior_art homologs that contained three methyl groups
315 f.2d at 383
the applicant responded with an affidavit showing that the claimed compound was an active anti-inflammatory agent while the prior_art was inactive in that respect but the board rejected the affidavit
id
our predecessor_court reversed finding that in addition to comparing the structural similarities and differences between a claimed compound and the prior_art a court should also` tak [ e ] into consideration their biological and pharmacological properties'
id.at 391
the court therefore accepted the affidavit and reversed the decision of the board
id.at 392
the specification in papesch clearly underscored the advantageous property of the drugs expressly stating that the` compounds of this invention have been found to possess unexpectedly potent anti-inflammatory activity in contrast to the related trimethyl compound'
id.at 382
this unexpected_result was a property contemplated by the inventor at the time of the invention

thus the cases cited by the majority actually support a requirement that an unexpected_result be either contained in the specification or contemporaneously known to the inventors
this rule is consistent with the written description_requirement which demands that the invention be in possession of the inventor as of the time the patent was filed
ariad pharms. inc. v. eli_lilly & co. 598_f.3d_1336 1351 fed.cir.2010 en banc holding that our written description_requirement requires that a specification` reasonably convey [ ] to those skilled in the art' that the inventor` actually invented' and` had possession of the claimed subject_matter as of the filing_date [ of the invention ]' citing vas-cath inc. v. mahurkar 935_f.2d_1555 1562-63 fed.cir.1991 ; see also ralston purina co. v. far-mar-co inc. 772_f.2d_1570 1575 fed.cir.1985
while as the majority points out certain secondary considerations such as evidence of commercial_success can depend on after-acquired knowledge such evidence must be directed to the significance of the invention and its scope
*1318 those factors can not expand the scope of the invention beyond what was known to the inventors at the time of the patent_filing

the majority rule-dispensing with any requirement that an inventor possess knowledge of the unexpected_results at the time the patent was filed-is not only unsupported by the cases it cites it is also contrary to common sense
an applicant should not be able to avoid an obviousness_determination merely by claiming additional undifferentiated structure like the a3_region without any showing that this structure conferred any known benefit over the prior_art at the time the invention was made
just as a challenger to a patent must rely on a known motivation to combine existing prior_art to achieve what the invention was designed achieved,6 so too the patent holder must prove that he actually contemplated the unexpected_results at the time the patent was filed and not at some later_time

it is significant that if genetics had brought this action at an earlier time-before it was discovered that vwf binding resided in the a3_region-the novartis_patents would likely have been found obvious
instead by happenstance and on hindsight novartis can now claim an advantage over the ¡¬ 112 patent based on information it did not know at the time of filing and based on research that was conducted by other parties

my fear is that the majoritys rule could ultimately stifle the important incentives for innovation that drive our patent system
even though novartis did not foresee the significance of the a3_region to vwf binding at the time its patent was filed the majority has effectively allowed novartis to broaden the scope of its claims to usurp the fruits of research by the subsequent independent inventors who actually discovered the location of vwf binding in the a3_region
by ruling that a patentee can have a monopoly on the later-discovered properties of a structure merely by claiming the structure itself the majoritys decision would discourage others from investing in future research into that very structure

i would therefore hold that the asserted claims of the ¡¬112_patent would render the asserted claims of the novartis_patents prima_facie obvious satisfying the first prong of the two-way interference test
i would not reach the question of whether the second prong would be satisfied that is whether the asserted claims of the novartis_patents would render obvious or anticipated the asserted claims of the ¡¬112_patent
it seems to me likely that they would but that is an inquiry i would leave to the district_court on remand

a nucleic_acid composition for introducing nucleic_acid into a eukaryotic host_cell to obtain expression of a recombinant_protein lacking all or a portion of the b_domain of human_factor_viii wherein said recombinant_protein consists of a first amino_acid_sequence which consists of an amino_acid_sequence having at least 90 %_sequence_identity with the contiguous_amino_acid_sequence of amino_acids 1_to_740 of the native mature a domain of human_factor_viii and optionally up to 10 amino_acids of the human_factor_viii_b_domain_sequence contiguous to amino_acid 740 as encoded by the polynucleotide_present in plasmid psvf8-200 atcc_no._40190 ; and
a second amino_acid_sequence which consists of an amino_acid_sequence having at least 90 %_sequence_identity with the contiguous_amino_acid_sequence of amino_acids 1649_to_2332 of the native mature c_domain of human_factor_viii and optionally up to 10 amino_acids of the human_factor_viii_b_domain_sequence contiguous to amino_acid 1649 as encoded by the polynucleotide_present in plasmid psvf8-200 atcc_no._40190 ; wherein said nucleic_acid encodes said first and second amino_acid_sequences and further wherein said recombinant_protein is capable of coagulation_activity in a coagulation_activity assay

claim 1 of the ¡¬447_patent reads 1
a composition comprising factor_viii c_proteins wherein the factor_viii c_proteins consist essentially of a first polypeptide comprising an amino_acid_sequence of the a domain of human_factor_viii c as encoded by the polynucleotide_present in plasmid psvf8-200 atcc_no._40190 or an amino_acid_sequence that differs therefrom in having not more than 10 number_%_amino_acid_substitutions and a second polypeptide comprising an amino_acid_sequence of the c_domain of human_factor_viii c as encoded by the polynucleotide_present in plasmid psvf8-200 atcc_no._40190 or an amino_acid_sequence that differs therefrom in having not more than 10 number_%_amino_acid_substitutions

in boehringer ingelheim international gmbh v. barr laboratories inc. 592_f.3d_1340 1349 fed.cir.2010 a case involving obviousness-type double patenting we suggested in passing that a patent_term_extension might apply only to specific claims
that dictum was not cited in support of either partys position in this case

see also in re mayne 104_f.3d_1339 1343 fed.cir.1997 finding a claimed enterokinase recognition sequence containing the amino_acid_sequence phe-pro-leu was merely` an obvious functional equivalent' to prior_art sequences that included arrangements of phe-pro-ile and leu-pro-leu ; in re dillon 919_f.2d_688 693 fed.cir.1990 finding a prima_facie_case of obviousness where the prior_art tri-orthoester_compound was found to be equivalent to the claimed tetra-orthoester_compound and the use of the tri-orthoester as a fuel additive was expected to produce essentially the same result as the use of the tetra-orthoester ; in re payne 606_f.2d_303 313-15 ccpa 1979 discussing the presumption of obviousness based on close structural_similarity

though the majority does not appear to dispute that the broader_range of deletions in the ¡¬112_patent subsumed the narrower_range of deletions in the novartis_patents i think the proper focus should be on the range of retentions not the range of deletions
this is so because we are concerned with whether the novartis_patents can be differentiated based on what they retain rather than what they delete
nonetheless whether the focus is on deletions or retentions there is still an overlap

`` we have also held that a prima_facie_case of obviousness exists when the claimed range and the prior_art_range do not overlap but are close enough such that one skilled in the art would have expected them to have the same properties'
peterson 315 f.3d at 1329 ; see titanium metals corp. v. banner 778_f.2d_775 776 783 fed.cir.1985 concluding that a claim directed to an alloy containing` 0.8 %_nickel 0.3 %_molybdenum up to 0.1 % maximum iron balance_titanium' would have been prima_facie obvious in view of a reference disclosing alloys containing 0.75 %_nickel 0.25 %_molybdenum balance_titanium and 0.94 %_nickel 0.31 %_molybdenum balance_titanium

for example claim 1 of the ¡¬112_patent teaches deletions that range from 581_to_949 amino_acids
a more conservative deletion in this range could still leave intact the a3_region critical to vwf binding

see in re herr 304_f.2d_906 909 ccpa 1962` [ if ] an [ unexpected advantage ] is not disclosed in appellants application he is not in a favorable position to urge it as a basis for the allowance of claims'
( internal_quotation_marks omitted citing in re lundberg 45_ccpa_838 253_f.2d_244 247 1958 ; in re crawford 45_ccpa_750 250_f.2d_370 373 1957` [ t ] here is no disclosure in appellants application that the glass of which the casing is made has the property recited in [ the claim ] ofsubstantially complete disintegration at a vibration frequency corresponding to that of the shock wave generated by detonation of the explosive body and accordingly patentability can not be predicated on that feature
`` ; in re stewart 42_ccpa_937 222_f.2d_747 754 1955` [ u ] nexpected results sufficient to spell out patentability must be disclosed not in briefs or affidavits filed in support of such patentability but instead in the specification itself
in adjudging in the first instance a patent_applicants right to a patent we are guided in our determination by that which is taught in the application and not by some subsequent undisclosed discovery`

as we discussed in eisai co. ltd. v. dr. reddys labs. ltd. 533_f.3d_1353 1359 fed.cir.2008 obviousness must be judged from the knowledge of one skilled in the art at the time of invention first ksr assumes a starting reference point or points in the art prior to the time of invention from which a skilled artisan might identify a problem and pursue potential solutions
second ksr presupposes that the record up to the time of invention would give some reasons available within the knowledge of one of skill in the art to make particular modifications to achieve the claimed compound.. third.. ksr presumes that the record before the time of invention would supply some reasons for narrowing the prior_art universe to a finite number of identified predictable solutions
