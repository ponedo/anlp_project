background
color images in magazines books and newspapers are conventionally formed by a process that uses four printing_plates and the four` process' inks cyan magenta yellow and black
in this process four films or` separations' are first made by scanning an original_color_image with an electronic scanner or by photographing the image through different_colored_filters.1 once the separations are prepared they are used to make four printing_plates each one corresponding to a process ink color
when used in combination the printing_plates generate a four-color_image which to the naked eye appears to encompass the entire spectrum of colors and shades

for certain printing applications such as the printing of telephone_directories newspapers and advertising flyers the conventional four-color separation process is prohibitively expensive due to the need to prepare and use four printing_plates
the invention disclosed and claimed in u.s._patent 4,554,241 2 addresses this problem by providing a process for printing color_images on paper using only two printing_plates and two` non-process' inks
wallace edwards is the inventor of this process and the chairman and chief executive officer of mark_i. edwards assigned his rights in the invention to mark_i.3

the241_patent discloses a process in which each of two printing_plates is created by sequentially making two different_filter_exposures of an original_color_image on a separation_film
the first_printing_plate which prints red ink is made by sequentially exposing a separation_film through green and blue_filters
the second_plate which prints another non-process ink such as green blue or black_ink is made by sequentially exposing a separation_film through red and blue_filters
claim 1 of the patent which is the focus of this litigation defines the invention as follows 1
a method of printing on a sheet_member a realistic_reproduction of a colored original utilizing a minimum of two different superimposed_impressions each with a different coloring medium comprising a providing a colored original b creating a first_printing_plate intended to print a non-process red color by
( 1 making a green filter exposure of the original on a first_means for recording a first_optical_image 2 making a blue_filter_exposure of the original on said first_means steps 1 and 2 being carried out sequentially in any order c creating a second_printing_plate intended to print a second color different from that printed by said first_plate by
*288 3 making a red filter exposure of the original on a second_means for recording a second_optical_image 4 making a blue_filter_exposure of the original on said second_means steps 3 and 4 being carried out sequentially in any order steps b and c being carried out in any order d providing a sheet_member to receive two superimposed_impressions and
( e using said first and second_printing_plates to print said red color and said different color respectively as the said superimposed_impressions on said sheet_member [ emphasis added ]

the patent specification indicates that either photographic or scanning techniques may be used to carry out the invention each film is exposed sequentially through the two filters or with the equivalent two lights on [ a ] conventional scanner
...
it is emphasized again that the interposition of actual colored_filters between the original and a means for recording an optical image such as a piece of film is not the only way to create the appropriate printer
the presently available scanner machines accomplish the same_effect by illuminating the original with light of a particular color
in the.. claims reference is made to` making a.. filter exposure' etc. and it is to be understood that this wording is intended to embrace those techniques which do not actually require a physical filter to be interposed but which achieve exactly the same_effect as if the filter had been interposed
col._3,_ll._42-44 ; col._6,_ll._6-17

donnelley is in the business of producing yellow pages telephone_directories
it prints color_images for its directories using a commercially available crosfield scanner and two non-process inks
the scanner focuses a single beam of white light on a small area a` pixel' of the colored original
the light reflects back into the scanner where it is split into three separate light beams
the beams are then simultaneously filtered through red green and blue_filters within the scanner
next the scanner senses the intensities of the beams and converts this information into digital values which are stored in memory
the scanner repeats this process for each pixel until the entire image has been scanned
to create separations the scanner analyzes the stored data to determine the size and density of the various ink dots needed to replicate each pixels color
it then converts the data into electrical impulses sends the impulses to light_sources lasers or lamps and pulses the light_sources to expose tiny spots on separation_films
each spot of film is either exposed only once or is not exposed at all
the resulting separations are used to make printing_plates which in turn are used to print images in donnelleys telephone_directories

mark_i sued donnelley alleging infringement of the241_patent4 donnelley denied the allegation and moved for summary_judgment of noninfringement arguing that it did not literally infringe the patent because it did not use filters sequentially or make sequential exposures of film
in addition donnelley argued that its process was known and used before the241 invention and therefore that the doctrine of equivalents was not applicable
see wilson sporting goods co. v. david geoffrey & assoc. 904_f.2d_677 684 14_uspq2d_1942 1948 fed.cir.1990` [ s ] ince prior_art always limits what an inventor could have claimed [ during prosecution ] it limits the range of permissible equivalents of a claim`
donnelley further argued that prosecution_history_estoppel_precludes_mark_i from establishing infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
in response mark_i essentially conceded that donnelley did not literally infringe the241_patent but argued that genuine_issues of material_fact precluded summary_judgment in donnelleys favor on mark_is theory of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents

*289 the district_court referred donnelleys motion to a magistrate_judge who issued a report and recommendation on june_10,_1994
the magistrate_judge determined that prosecution_history_estoppel precluded mark_i from proving infringement under the doctrine of equivalents and thus recommended that the court grant summary_judgment of noninfringement
the district_court deciding the motion independently granted summary_judgment on a different ground
the court determined that mark_i did not refute donnelleys factual assertion that the accused process was in the prior_art and thus that it could not infringe the patent under the doctrine of equivalents
the court found that mark_i through the affidavit of its expert had only asserted that the241_patent was not invalid even though donnelley never challenged the patents validity
thus in the courts view mark_i failed to raise a genuine_issue of material_fact concerning donnelleys theory of noninfringement
in granting summary_judgment the court found it unnecessary to determine whether prosecution_history_estoppel precluded mark_i from establishing infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
this appeal followed

summary_judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine_issue as to any material_fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law

conroy v. reebok int l ltd. 14_f.3d_1570 1575 29_uspq2d_1373 1377 fed.cir.1994

mark_i does not contest the courts determination that donnelley did not literally infringe the241_patent
rather mark_i asserts that the court erred in holding that mark_i did not refute donnelleys assertion that the accused process can not infringe the241_patent because it is a prior_art process
mark_i further argues that the question of prosecution_history_estoppel raises genuine_issues of material_fact precluding a grant of summary_judgment
donnelley responds that the court correctly granted summary_judgment because mark_i did not dispute donnelleys contention that it practices the prior_art
alternatively donnelley contends that prosecution_history_estoppel precludes application of the doctrine of equivalents in this case

having thoroughly reviewed the record we have concluded that the district_courts judgment should be affirmed on the ground of prosecution_history_estoppel
although the district_court did not reach this question` [ b ] ecause this issue is purely legal and was fully briefed to the district_court in the interests of economy this court will decide [ the issue ] on the merits..' dupont merck pharmaceutical co. v. bristol-myers_squibb_co. 62_f.3d_1397 1401 fed.cir.1995
to determine whether prosecution_history_estoppel_precludes_mark_i from establishing infringement under the doctrine of equivalents we must review the prosecution_history of the241_patent

a
prosecution history of the241_patent
mark_i filed the` grandparent' application to the241_patent serial_no._485668 on april_18,_1983
the668 application broadly claimed a process of simulating colored originals by printing with two different colored inks
claim 1 of the application required the formation of two separations but importantly it did not require that either separation be made by sequentially interposing two different_filters 1
a method of printing on a sheet_member a realistic_image of an original utilizing two different superimposed_impressions with two different inks comprising *290 making a first film and therefrom a first_plate adapted to print a first_ink having a first hue at all locations corresponding to a first colour predominating in the original making a second film and therefrom a second_plate adapted to print a second_ink having a second hue at locations such that the second_ink in relation to the first_ink seen against the sheet gives to the eye the impression of a third hue present in the original but not present in either the first or second_inks coating the plates with their respective inks and printing the sheet_member with the plates

in a first_office_action the u.s._patent and trademark office pto rejected claim 1_under_35 u.s.c.¡± 102 as being anticipated by a dupont_magazine_article entitled` multicolor effects on two-color presses'
the article describes two-color printing on colored paper and in particular suggests the use of` two printing_plates to blend red and blue ink on yellow paper'
the pto also rejected claims 1-big_token__5_under_35__big_token u.s.c.¡± 103 as being obvious over the dupont_magazine_article in view of three secondary references
the office_action was conclusory and did not discuss the cited references or articulate any reasons supporting the rejections

mark_i however did not respond to the office_action
instead it filed a continuation-in-part_application
the claims originally filed in that application also required the use of two printing_plates and like the668 application did not require that either printing_plate be made by sequentially interposing filters
claim 1 of the815 application read as follows 1
a method of printing on a sheet_member a realistic_image of an original utilizing two different superimposed_impressions with two different_colouring_media comprising creating a first_printing_plate by the interposition of at least two filters between the original and means for recording a first_optical_image creating a second_printing_plate by the interposition of at least one filter between the original and means for recording a second_optical_image and using said first and second_plates to print the said different_impressions with two different_colouring_media

on june_8,_1984 before receiving a first_office_action mark_i amended claim 1 to require that the first but not the second printing_plate be made by sequentially interposing two different_colored_filters
specifically claim 1 was amended to read as follows 1
( amended a method of printing on a sheet_member a realistic_image of an original utilizing two different superimposed_impressions with two different_colouring_media comprising creating a first_printing_plate by the sequential_interposition of at least two different_colour_filters between the original and means for recording a first_optical_image creating a second_printing_plate by the interposition of at least one filter between the original and means for recording a second_optical_image and using said first and second_plates to print the said different_impressions with two different_colouring_media

then in july 1984 mark_i filed a petition to make special pursuant to m.p.e.p.¡± 708.02.viii.5 in the petition mark_i characterized the claimed invention as follows

the applicant.. has discovered an alteration in the film-producing step typically employed in the four-colour separation process which alteration is such as to allow a stunningly realistic_reproduction of an original in only two inks..
the alteration.. involves in the case of the use of film the double exposure of *291 the film using two different_filters sequentially [ emphasis added ]
in addition quoting language from claim 1 mark_i distinguished the claimed process from several prior_art references cited in its accompanying search report on the ground that the references did not suggest` thesequential_interposition of at least two different_colour_filters between the original and means for recording a first_optical_image [ emphasis added ]
`` despite mark_is attempt to distinguish the claimed invention from the prior_art based on the claim limitation that the first separation be made by sequentially interposing two filters the pto in a september 18 1984 office_action rejected claims 1_and_4 -10 of the815 application under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 as being obvious over the lithographers_manual vol
i waltwin pub.1958 in view of the dupont_magazine_article
the lithographers_manual suggests making a printing_plate using supplemental_film_exposures with different_colored_filters
the examiner took the position that it would have been obvious to apply the teachings of the lithographers_manual to any conventional color processing technique including the two-color process disclosed in the dupont_magazine_article
dependent claims 2_and_3 were also rejected on similar grounds

mark_i again did not respond to the office_action but instead filed a second continuation-in-part_application
that application contained new_claims which required for the first time that each of the two recited printing_plates be formed using two filters and that both printing_plates be made by sequentially making two different_filter_exposures of the original_color_image on a film
the application was allowed without comment by the examiner and issued as the241_patent

b
prosecution history estoppel
prosecution history estoppel precludes a patentee from obtaining in an infringement suit patent protection for subject_matter which it relinquished during prosecution in order to obtain allowance of the claims
zenith lab. inc. v. bristol-myers_squibb_co. 19_f.3d_1418 1424 30_uspq2d_1285 1290 fed.cir
) cert
denied 513_u.s._995 115_s.ct._500 130_l.ed.2d_409_(1994)
it thus serves as a check on the applicability of the doctrine of equivalents
the standard for determining whether particular subject_matter was relinquished is an objective one that depends on what a competitor reasonably would conclude from the patents prosecution_history
id
the application of prosecution_history_estoppel is a question of law
labounty mfg. inc. v. united states int l trade comm n 867_f.2d_1572 1576 9_uspq2d_1995 1998 fed.cir.1989

`` the prosecution_history must be examined as a whole in determining whether estoppel applies'
wang lab. inc. v. toshiba corp. 993_f.2d_858 867 26_uspq2d_1767 1775 fed.cir.1993
thus the relevant prosecution_history here includes not only the659 application but also the parent815 and grandparent668 applications
see jonsson v. stanley works 903_f.2d_812 818 14_uspq2d_1863 1869 fed.cir.1990 prosecution_history of parent application is relevant to understanding scope of claims issuing in a continuation-in-part_application

the prosecution_history of the241_patent indicates that the grandparent668 application broadly claimed a process for reproducing color_images by printing with two printing_plates and two inks
the claims were rejected over prior_art that suggested replicating a color_image using two printing_plates and two inks
instead of responding to the rejection mark_i filed the815 continuation-in-part_application with new_claims
mark_i then narrowed the815 claims to require that the first_printing_plate be made by sequentially interposing filters
subsequently in its petition to make special mark_i argued that the sequential_interposition of filters distinguished the claimed invention from the prior_art
the815 application claims were then rejected over a combination of references which in the ptos view suggested using supplemental_film_exposures in a two-color printing process
rather than respond to the rejection mark_i again chose to file a continuation-in-part_application with new_claims
the claims in the659 application were even narrower than the815 claims *292 and required that both plates be made by sequentially interposing colored_filters

donnelley argues that the prosecution_history of the241_patent shows that mark_i surrendered claim_coverage for a process not involving sequential_interposition of colored_filters
we agree
the prosecution_history demonstrates that mark_i was unsuccessful in obtaining allowance of the claims until they were narrowed to require that both the first and the second_printing_plates be made by sequentially interposing particular combinations of colored_filters
moreover during prosecution mark_i asserted that the claims were patentably distinguishable over the prior_art based on these process steps
thus in our view a competitor reviewing the prosecution_history of the241_patent reasonably would conclude that in order to procure issuance of the patent mark_i surrendered claim_coverage to a process not involving sequential_interposition of filters

the fact that the claims of the659 application were not themselves rejected by the patent office or amended by mark_i does not call for a different result
mark_i chose to file continuing applications with successively narrower claims in lieu of otherwise responding to the ptos rejections but an estoppel is not avoided by failing to respond to a rejection and instead meeting the substance of the rejection by filing a narrower continuing application
rather the prosecution_history must be viewed as a whole to determine whether and what subject_matter was surrendered to procure issuance of the patent
viewed in its entirety the prosecution_history of the241_patent clearly shows that mark_i surrendered claim_coverage in order to obtain an allowance of the claims

mark_i argues that at a minimum the question of prosecution_history_estoppel raises genuine_issues of material_fact precluding a grant of summary_judgment
we disagree
the relevant facts here are undisputed ; the prosecution_history of the241_patent is a matter of public_record
moreover the meaning of the prosecution_history is clear
a competitor reviewing the241_patents prosecution_history would not have to go beyond the public_record to reasonably conclude that mark_i had relinquished claim_coverage for a process not involving sequentially interposing colored_filters

we therefore hold that mark_i is estopped from asserting infringement by any process that does not involve a sequential_interposition of colored_filters
the accused process indisputably does not involve the sequential_interposition of filters ; rather three light beams are simultaneously filtered through red green and blue_filters within the scanner
thus no reasonable fact-finder could find that the accused process infringes the241_patent ; summary_judgment of noninfringement was therefore appropriate
see brenner v. united states 773_f.2d_306 307 227_uspq_159 160 fed.cir.1985 summary_judgment of noninfringement will be upheld on appeal when there is no literal infringement` and a prosecution_history_estoppel makes clear that no actual infringement under the doctrine of equivalents can be found
``

because the prosecution_history_estoppel issue is dispositive we need not decide whether the district_court correctly ruled that mark_i failed to dispute donnelleys contention that its process is prior_art to the241_patent

conclusion
the district_courts grant of summary_judgment of noninfringement in favor of donnelley is affirmed

affirmed

when a photographic process is used the filters are of colors complementary to the process ink colors
thus three separations are made by separately photographing the original image through red blue and green_filters ; the separations are used to make printing_plates that will print cyan yellow and magenta inks respectively
a fourth separation used to make a printing_plate that will print black_ink is made either by photographing the original through a combination of red blue and green_filters or by photographing the original in black and white
