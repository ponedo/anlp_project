david richardson appeals from a final decision of the united_states_district_court for the district of arizona
richardson v. stanley_works inc. 610_f.supp.2d_1046 d.ariz.2009
after a bench_trial the district_court found that stanley_works inc.` stanley' did not infringe u.s. patent d507,167` the ¡¬167_patent`
because the court correctly construed the claim at issue and correctly determined that the patent was not infringed we affirm

background
richardson owns the ¡¬167_patent a design_patent that claims the design for a multi-function carpentry tool that combines a conventional_hammer with a stud climbing tool and a crowbar
the tool is known as the` stepclaw'
the only claim of the ¡¬167_patent claims the ornamental_design of the tool as depicted in figures 1_and_2 of the patent

stanley manufactures and sells construction tools
in 2005 stanley introduced into the u.s._market a product line of tools by the series name` fubar'
the fubar is sold in five different versions and is useful in carpentry demolition and construction work
stanley successfully applied for and obtained u.s. patent d562,101` the ¡¬101_patent` on the basic fubar design
all five versions of the tool are built around that same basic fubar design
figures 1_and_5 of the ¡¬101_patent are illustrative of the fubar design

*1292. ?
figure 1. ?
figure 5
on june_3,_2008 richardson filed a complaint against stanley in the district_court for the district of arizona alleging that the fubar_tools infringed his ¡¬ 167 patent
in addition richardson alleged that stanley was unfairly competing with him in the u.s._market
in response to richardsons complaint stanley first filed a motion to dismiss on september 10 2008 and later filed an answer to the complaint on september 22 2008
on october 22 2008 richardson filed his request for a jury_trial which stanley moved to strike as untimely under federal rule of civil procedure 38 b
in response richardson requested that a jury_trial be granted under rule 39 b
the district_court granted stanleys motion to strike and denied richardsons rule 39 b motion
richardson v. stanley_works inc. no
cv-08-1040-phx-nvw 2009_wl_383554_(d.ariz._feb._13,_2009)
the court also granted stanleys motion to dismiss richardsons unfair competition claim
richardson v. stanley_works inc. no
cv-08-1040-phxnvw 2008_wl_4838708_(d.ariz._nov._6,_2008)
on april_2,_2009 the court conducted a bench_trial on richardsons patent infringement claim and entered judgment of noninfringement in favor of stanley
richardson 610 f.supp.2d at 1053
in its order the court first distinguished as part of its claim_construction the ornamental_aspects from the functional_aspects of richardsons design and then determined that an ordinary_observer after discounting the functional_elements of richardsons design would not be deceived into thinking that any of the fubar_tools were the same as richardsons stepclaw
id.at 1050-1052
the court therefore concluded that the overall_visual_effect of the fubar was *1293 not substantially similar to that of the stepclaw and that the ¡¬ 167 patent had not been infringed
id.at 1053
richardson timely appealed the courts rulings
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

discussion
a
claim construction
richardson argues that the district_courts approach to evaluating infringement of a design_patent was incorrect
richardson primarily argues that the district_court erred in its claim_construction by separating the functional_aspects of the design from the ornamental ones rather than considering the design as a whole
richardson argues that our egyptian_goddess decision requires that the patented_design be compared in its entirety with the accused design and that the comparison be made from the perspective of an ordinary_observer
see egyptian_goddess inc. v. swisa inc. 543_f.3d_665_(fed.cir.2008) en banc
a claim_construction such as the one performed by the district_court richardson argues is necessary only for designs that contain` purely functional' elements
according to richardson a design element is purely functional only when the function encompassed by that element can not be performed by any other design
richardson contends that the overall_design of the ¡¬167_patent is not dictated by the useful elements found in the tool and that the functional parts of its design remain relevant to the scope of the patented claim

we review claim_construction de novo on appeal
cybor corp. v. fas techs. inc. 138_f.3d_1448 1456 fed.cir.1998 en banc
we disagree with richardson that the district_court erred in its claim_construction by separating the functional and ornamental_aspects of the ¡¬167_patent_design
in oddzon we affirmed a district_courts claim_construction wherein the court had carefully distinguished the ornamental_features of the patented_design from the overall` rocket-like' appearance of the design of a football-shaped foam ball with a tail and fin structure
oddzon prods. inc. v. just toys inc. 122_f.3d_1396 1405 fed.cir.1997
we held that` [ w ] here a design contains both functional and non-functional_elements the scope of the claim must be construed in order to identify the non-functional_aspects of the design as shown in the patent'
id

the issue before us is not very different from that in oddzon and we are not persuaded by richardsons argument that our holding in egyptian_goddess mandates a different result here
in egyptian_goddess we abandoned the point of novelty test for design_patent infringement and held that the ordinary_observer_test should serve as the sole_test for infringement
543 f.3d at 679
although we proposed that the preferable course ordinarily will be for a district_court not to attempt to construe a design_patent claim id. we also emphasized that there are a number of claim scope issues on which a courts guidance would be useful to the fact finder
id.at 680
among them we specifically noted is the distinction between the functional and ornamental_aspects of a design
id
( citing oddzon 122 f.3d at 1405

the district_court here properly factored out the functional_aspects of richardsons design as part of its claim_construction
by definition the patented_design is for a multi-function tool that has several functional components and we have made clear that a design_patent unlike a utility patent limits protection to the ornamental_design of the article
lee v. dayton-hudson corp. 838_f.2d_1186 1188 fed.cir.1988 citing 35 u.s.c.¡± 171
if the patented_design is primarily *1294 functional rather than ornamental the patent is invalid
id
however when the design also contains ornamental_aspects it is entitled to a design_patent whose scope is limited to those aspects alone and does not extend to any functional_elements of the claimed article
see l.a._gear inc. v. thom mcan shoe co. 988_f.2d_1117 1123 fed.cir.1993` the elements of the design may indeed serve a utilitarian purpose but it is the ornamental aspect that is the basis of the design_patent
``

richardsons multi-function tool comprises several elements that are driven purely by utility
as the district_court noted elements such as the handle the hammerhead the jaw and the crowbar are dictated by their functional purpose
the jaw for example has to be located on the opposite end of the hammer head such that the tool can be used as a step
the crowbar by definition needs to be on the end of the longer handle such that it can reach into narrow spaces
the handle has to be the longest arm of the tool to allow for maximum leverage
the hammer-head has to be flat on its end to effectively deliver force to the object being struck
as demonstrated by the prior_art those are purely functional_elements whose utility has been known and used in the art for well over a century

richardsons argument that the court erred in separating out functional_aspects of his design essentially is an argument for a claim scope that includes the utilitarian elements of his multi-function tool
we agree with the district_court that it would indeed be improper to allow richardson to do so
the ¡¬167_patent specifically claims` the ornamental_design' for the multi-function tool shown in the drawings
see ¡¬167_patent cl
1
a claim to a design containing numerous_functional_elements such as here necessarily mandates a narrow construction
nothing in our en banc egyptian_goddess opinion compels a different outcome

we also reject richardsons argument that the court did not include drawings from the patent in its claim_construction
richardson argues that it is the ordinary_observers perception of those drawings that is the controlling consideration under the supreme courts opinion in gorham manufacturing company v. white 14_wall._511 81_u.s._511 20_l.ed._731_(1871)
we agree with richardson on the decisive importance of drawings in a design_patent
we have recently stated that design_patents are typically claimed according to their drawings and claim_construction must be adapted to a pictorial setting
crocs inc. v. int l trade comm n 598_f.3d_1294 1302-03 fed.cir.2010
however we do not agree that the district_courts claim_construction necessarily excluded drawings of the ¡¬167_patent
the courts entire construction was based on what was` shown and described in the ¡¬167_patent'
richardson 610 f.supp.2d at 1050
the court concluded its discussion by noting that the purpose of the claim_construction was simply to highlight the ornamental_aspects of richardsons design
id
richardson fails to explain how a court could effectively construe design claims where necessary in a way other than by describing the features shown in the drawings
richardsons proposition that the claim_construction should comprise nothing more than the drawings is simply another way of arguing that the court erred by identifying the functional_elements of the patented article and is therefore unavailing
we find no error in the courts claim_construction

b
infringement
richardson argues that the district_court failed to analyze infringement of the ¡¬ *1295 167 patent by stanleys tools under an ordinary_observer_test
according to richardson had the court conducted a three-way comparison between the prior_art the patented_design and the accused products it would have found the accused product design to be substantially the same as the patented one

stanley responds that having identified the ornamental_aspects of richardsons patented_design the court properly found that the only similarities between the patented stepclaw and the accused fubar_tools were those of unprotectable functional_elements
stanley argues that when those utilitarian aspects are ignored none of the accused fubar products looks even remotely like richardsons patented_design

we agree with the courts finding of noninfringement
design patent infringement is a question of fact which a patentee must prove by a preponderance of the evidence
l.a._gear 988 f.2d at 1124
in egyptian_goddess we held that` theordinary_observer test should be the sole_test for determining whether a design_patent has been infringed'
543 f.3d at 678
the patentee must establish that an ordinary_observer familiar with the prior_art designs would be deceived into believing that the accused product is the same as the patented_design
see id.at 681
in our recent crocs decision we set out in detail how an ordinary_observer analysis could be conducted to determine infringement
see crocs 598 f.3d at 1303-06
in analyzing whether a design_patent on footwear was infringed noting the various differences that could be found between the two pieces of footwear in question we compared their overall_effect on the designs
id.at 1306-07
we looked to ornamental elements such as the curves in the design the strap assembly and the base portion of the footwear
id
we concluded that both the claimed design and the accused designs contained those overall ornamental effects thereby allowing for market_confusion
id

the ordinary_observer_test similarly applies in cases where the patented_design incorporates numerous_functional_elements
see amini innovation corp. v. anthony cal. inc. 439_f.3d_1365 1372 fed.cir.2006 holding that while it is proper to factor out the functional_aspects of various design elements that discounting of functional_elements must not convert the overall infringement test to an element-by-element comparison
in evaluating infringement we determine whether` the deception that arises is a result of the similarities in the overall_design not of similarities in ornamental_features in isolation'
amini innovation 439 f.3d at 1371

we do not agree with richardson that the district_court failed to apply the ordinary_observer_test in finding no infringement
the court specifically concluded that` [ f ] rom the perspective of an ordinary_observer familiar with the prior_art the overall_visual_effect of the fubar is significantly different from the stepclaw'
richardson 610 f.supp.2d at 1052
it recited the significant differences between the ornamental_features of the two designs but in determining infringement it mainly focused on whether an ordinary_observer would be deceived into thinking that any of the fubar designs were the same as richardsons patented_design
id
we therefore find no error in the district_courts approach
see egyptian_goddess 543 f.3d at 681` an ordinary_observer comparing the claimed and accused designs in light of the prior_art will attach importance to differences between the claimed design and the prior_art depending on the overall_effect of those differences on the design
`` ; *1296 see also int l seaway trading corp. v. walgreens corp. 589_f.3d_1233 1243 fed.cir.2009` the mandated overall comparison is a comparison taking into account significant differences between the two designs not minor or trivial differences that necessarily exist between any two designs that are not exact copies of one another
``

we also agree that ignoring the functional_elements of the tools the two designs are indeed different
each of the fubar_tools has a streamlined visual theme that runs throughout the design including elements such as a tapered hammer-head a streamlined crow-bar a triangular neck with rounded surfaces and a smoothly contoured handled
in a side-by-side comparison with the ¡¬167_patent_design the overall_effect of this streamlined theme makes the fubar_tools significantly different from richardsons design
overall the accused products clearly have a more rounded appearance and fewer blunt edges than the patented_design
the court therefore was not clearly erroneous in concluding that the accused products embody an overall_effect that can not be found in the ¡¬167_patent_design and hence can not cause market_confusion
see egyptian_goddess 543 f.3d at 681 infringement can not be found unless the accused product creates an appearance deceptively similar to the claimed design

c. jury demand
we lastly address richardsons argument that the district_court improperly denied richardsons jury_demand as untimely
the court found that at the time richardson filed his jury_demand the pleadings were closed
richardson 2009_wl_383554 at *1
however richardson argues that at the time he filed his jury_demand a motion to dismiss was pending and the rule 38 b clock did not start until the motion had been ruled upon by the court
moreover richardson argues the court had ample discretion to grant his jury_demand under rule 39 b but refused to do so improperly concluding that richardsons inadvertence foreclosed any further analysis of the merits of his motion
richardson contends that under ninth_circuit_law failure to file a jury_demand based on a pending motion to dismiss does not bar the court from employing its discretion to allow a jury_trial

stanley responds that its motion to dismiss was not a pleading and hence did not toll the 10-day deadline for richardson to file a jury_demand
moreover stanley argues the motion to dismiss was limited to state law claims and did not in any way affect richardsons deadline for filing a jury_demand for the patent infringement claims

we agree with stanley that the district_court permissibly denied richardsons motion for a jury_trial
we apply regional circuit law to a trial_courts procedural decisions that relate to issues not unique to our exclusive jurisdiction including motions for a jury_trial
see transmatic inc. v. gulton indus. inc. 53_f.3d_1270 1278 fed.cir.1995
under ninth_circuit_law a trial_courts determination of the timeliness of a demand for jury_trial under rule 38 b is reviewed de novo
see kulas v. flores 255_f.3d_780 783 9th_cir.2001

in examining that question we` indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver' of the jury_trial right
cal
scents v. surco prods. inc. 406_f.3d_1102 1108 9th cir.2005
rule 38 b states that` a party may demand a jury_trial by.. serving the other parties with a written demand-which may be included in a pleading-no later than 10 days after the last_pleading directed to the issue is *1297 served'
fed.r.civ.p
38 b1 the district_court noted that stanleys answer was the last_pleading directed to any issue triable of right by a jury in this case
richardson 2009_wl_383554 at *1
accordingly the court concluded that richardsons jury_demand was untimely because he served it more than ten days after stanley filed its answer
id
the court held that the fact that a motion to dismiss was pending did not toll the time for richardson to file a jury_demand
id

rule 7 a lists the types of pleadings permissible in federal cases
fed.r.civ.p
7 a
a motion to dismiss is not one of them
it is not a pleading directed to issues of fact triable by the jury
united states v. anderson 584_f.2d_369 372_n._4_(10th_cir.1978) stating that a motion to dismiss is not a pleading within the federal_rules
richardson cites no authority suggesting that such a motion could be considered otherwise in the application of rule 38.2 richardsons proposed interpretation of the rule would indefinitely extend a partys deadline to make a jury_demand until the court rules on all such pending motions
we see nothing in the federal_rules that allows such a reading
we agree with the district_court that richardsons jury_demand was untimely regardless of stanleys pending motion

the ninth_circuit reviews a district_courts decision to deny relief under rule 39 b for an abuse of discretion
see las vegas sun inc. v. summa corp. 610_f.2d_614 621 9th cir.1979
a district_courts discretion in granting an untimely demand for a jury_trial under rule 39 b is narrow and does not permit a court to grant relief when the failure to make a timely demand results from oversight or inadvertence
see pacific fisheries corp. v. hih cas
& general ins. ltd. 239_f.3d_1000 1002 9th_cir.2001 citing lewis v. time inc. 710_f.2d_549 556-57 9th cir.1983
the ninth_circuit mandates denial of an untimely request for a jury_trial unless some cause beyond mere_inadvertence is shown
id

richardson argues that it presented more reason than mere_inadvertence for its untimely motion
once again he contends that stanleys motion to dismiss and subsequently filed answer in response to his complaint put him in a difficult position of determining when his jury_demand was due and eventually miscalculating his deadline for making the demand
richardson therefore appears to argue that his delay was not due to mere_inadvertence but rather due to a good_faith_mistake in determining the deadline under the federal_rules

we find richardsons argument unpersuasive
even if richardsons failure to timely file a jury_demand were considered to be a result of his good_faith_mistake as to the deadline in light of stanleys motion to dismiss such a mistake establishes no more than inadvertence under ninth_circuit_law
zivkovic v. s. cal
edison co. 302_f.3d_1080 1087 9th cir.2002` [ g ] ood faith mistake as to the deadline for demanding a jury_trial establishes no more than inadvertence which is not a sufficient basis to grant relief from an untimely jury *1298 demand`
the district_court properly refused to exercise its discretion in rejecting richardsons rule 39 b request

conclusion
we have considered richardsons remaining arguments and do not find them persuasive
accordingly the judgment of the district_court is

affirmed
