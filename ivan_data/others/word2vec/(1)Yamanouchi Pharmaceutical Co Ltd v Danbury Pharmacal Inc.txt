opinion
rader circuit_judge
on a motion for judgment as a matter of law jmol the united_states_district_court for the southern_district of new_york upheld the validity of claim 4 of u.s._patent_no._4283,408 the408_patent in favor of yamanouchi_pharmaceutical_co. ltd. and merck & co. inc. collectively yamanouchi
see yamanouchi pharm co. v. danbury_pharmacal inc. 21_f.supp.2d_366 370 48_uspq2d_1741 1744 s.d.n.y.1998
the district_court also found that defendants danbury_pharmacal inc. danbury schein_pharmaceutical inc. schein and marsam_pharmaceuticals inc. marsam willfully infringed the408_patent and awarded attorney_fees to yamanouchi
see id.at 378
because the district_court correctly upheld the validity of the408_patent and did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney_fees this court affirms

i
the408_patent issued to yamanouchi on august 11 1981 relates to inhibitors of gastric acid secretion
claim 4 of the408_patent the only claim at issue claims famotidine for treating heartburn and ulcers
famotidine belongs to a class of compounds known as histamine2 antagonists h2_antagonists which inhibit production of stomach acid
as figure 1 illustrates the general chemical structure of h2_antagonists includes a` substituted_heterocycle' group a` alkyl containing' chain called a` bridge' and a` polar_tail' connected in that order

?
figure 1* -- -- famotidine
during the 1960s and 70s drug manufacturers searched for h2_antagonists with improved pharmacological properties including low toxicity high_activity and lack of side_effects
research revealed hundreds of thousands of potential compounds
indeed pharmaceutical companies synthesized more than 11,000 h2 antagonist compounds
see yamanouchi 21 f.supp.2d at 371
very rarely however were these compounds pharmacologically suitable h2_antagonists
notable failures include tiotidine which caused cancer in rats ; burimamide which was ineffective for oral dosing ; metiamide which caused white blood cell loss ; lupitidine which caused pre-cancerous lesions in rats ; and oxmetidine which caused hepatitis

of the 11,000 candidates for suitable compounds fewer than fifty showed enough promise to warrant human clinical trials
ultimately the fda approved only *1342 four for consumer use cimetidine,1 ranitidine,2 famotidine,3 and nizatidine.4 famotidine the claimed compound at issue has been extremely successful
in 1996 for example prescription sales of famotidine in the united_states alone reached over 690 million dollars

danbury is a subsidiary of schein which produces and markets generic_drugs
in january 1997 danbury filed an abbreviated_new_drug_application anda with the food and drug administration fda seeking approval to market generic famotidine
under the anda procedure an applicant seeks fda_approval to market a generic_drug
the hatch-waxman_act also known as the drug price competition and patent term restoration act pub.l
no._98-417 98_stat._1585_(1984) codified as amended at 21 u.s.c.¡± 355_and_35 u.s.c.¡± 271 e 1994 amended the federal food drug and cosmetic act fdca pub.l
no._52-675 52_stat._1040_(1938) codified as amended at 21 u.s.c.¡±¡± 301-397 1994 to permit filing of an anda to expedite fda_approval of a generic_version of a drug previously approved by the fda
see e.g. bayer ag v. elan pharm
research corp. 212_f.3d_1241 1244 54_uspq2d_1711 1712 fed.cir.2000

under the fdca an anda_filer must certify one of the following four statements concerning the previously approved drug it is not patented paragraph i certification its patent has expired paragraph ii certification its patent soon will expire on a specified date paragraph iii certification or its patent` is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture use or sale of the new drug' covered by the anda paragraph_iv_certification
see 21 u.s.c.¡± 355 j 2 a vii i - iv
to obtain approval of an anda the fdca requires only that the generic_drug is the` bioequivalent' of the previously approved drug
see 21 u.s.c.¡± 355 j 2 a iv

in danburys anda for famotidine danbury made a paragraph_iv_certification that claim 4 of the408_patent is invalid
see 21 u.s.c.¡± 355 j 2 a vii iv
as the statute requires danbury on march_26,_1997 sent yamanouchi a patent certification notice letter
this certification_letter informed yamanouchi of danburys paragraph iv anda_filing
accompanying the certification_letter were affidavits from drs
bernard loev and john k. siepler supporting danburys invalidity certification
the notice letter contained as the statute requires an analysis of the prior_art and the reasons for the asserted invalidity

within forty-five days of receiving the certification_letter yamanouchi filed suit against danbury alleging infringement of the408_patent under 35 u.s.c.¡± 271 e 2 a and willful_infringement under 35 u.s.c.¡± 285 1994
see 35 u.s.c.¡± 271 e 4
during this period marsam filed a number of paragraph iv andas seeking fda_approval to market injectable versions of famotidine
yamanouchi then filed suit against marsam and the two suits were consolidated danbury schein and marsam are hereinafter collectively referred to as danbury
the parties agreed to a bench trial

after danbury presented its last witness on obviousness yamanouchi moved for jmol under fed.r.civ.p
52 c rule 52 c
with that motion yamanouchi argued that danbury had not shown by clear and convincing_evidence that claim 4 of the408_patent would have been obvious at the time of invention
the district_court granted yamanouchis jmol motion
see yamanouchi 21 f.supp.2d at 370
specifically the district_court found that danbury had not shown any motivation to combine selected portions of various prior_art compounds to create the specific compound famotidine and to obtain its extraordinary *1343 properties
see id.at 373
the district_court characterized danburys case for obviousness as largely hindsight speculation and argument without an adequate_foundation
see id.at 370 373 376
based on those findings the district_court determined that danbury willfully infringed the408_patent
the district_court thus found the case` exceptional' and awarded attorney_fees and costs to yamanouchi
see id.at 378

ii
to grant a jmol under rule 52 c a district judge must weigh the evidence and resolve credibility
see fed.r.civ.p
52 a and c ; lemelson v. united_states 752_f.2d_1538 1547 224_uspq_526 530-31 fed.cir.1985
therefore this court reviews the district_courts jmol findings as if entered at the conclusion of all the evidence
see lemelson 752 f.2d at 1547 ; woods v. north am
rockwell corp. 480_f.2d_644 645-46 10th cir.1973
this court reviews the conclusion on obviousness a question of law without deference and the underlying findings of fact for clear error
see univ
of colo found. inc. v. am
cyanamid co. 196_f.3d_1366 1370 52_uspq2d_1801 1803 fed.cir.1999

a. obviousness rests on several critical factual underpinnings 1 the scope and content of the prior_art 2 the differences between the prior_art and the claimed invention 3 the level of skill in the art and 4 the objective indicia of nonobviousness
see panduit corp. v. dennison mfg co. 810_f.2d_1561 1566-67 1_uspq2d_1593 1595-96 fed.cir.1987 ; graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 17 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966)
for a chemical compound a prima_facie_case of obviousness requires` structural similarity between claimed and prior_art subject matter.. where the prior_art gives reason or motivation to make the claimed compositions'
in re dillon 919_f.2d_688 692 16_uspq2d_1897 1901 fed.cir.1990 en banc
`` [ a ] reasonable_expectation of success not absolute predictability' supports a conclusion of obviousness
in re_longi 759_f.2d_887 896 225_uspq_645 651-52 fed.cir.1985

as noted earlier the district_court discerned that danbury had not proven any motivation to combine prior_art references to produce the claimed invention
this court has recently reemphasized the importance of the motivation to combine as this court has stated` virtually all [ inventions ] are combinations of old elements'
therefore an examiner [ or accused infringer ] may often find every element of a claimed invention in the prior_art
if identification of each claimed element in the prior_art were sufficient to negate patentability very few patents would ever issue
furthermore rejecting patents solely by finding prior_art corollaries for the claimed elements would permit an examiner [ or accused infringer ] to use the claimed invention itself as a blueprint for piecing together elements in the prior_art to defeat the patentability of the claimed invention

.
.
.
.
.
... to counter this potential weakness in the obviousness construct the suggestion to combine requirement stands as a critical safeguard against hindsight analysis and rote application of the legal test for obviousness
in re rouffet 149_f.3d_1350 1357-58 47_uspq2d_1453 1457 fed.cir.1998 internal citations omitted

at the heart of this validity dispute is whether one of skill in this art would have found motivation to combine pieces from one compound in a prior_art patent with a piece of another compound in the second prior_art patent through a series of manipulations
according to danbury one of skill in the art would have considered it obvious to select the example 44 compound from yamanouchis u.s._patent_no._4252,819 the819_patent and tiotidine from the378_patent to use as leads for making *1344 famotidine
these compounds respectively are three and eleven times more active than cimetidine-the benchmark compound at the time of invention figure 2
after selecting these two lead_compounds danbury continues it would have been obvious to combine the polar_tail from example 44 figure 3 with the substituted_heterocycle from tiotidine figure 4 thus creating the intermediate_compound figure 5
thereafter to create famotidine danbury argues that it would have been obvious to perform a bioisosteric substitution of the carbamoyl conh2 group in the intermediate_compound with a sulfamoyl_group so2nh2

figure 2* -- -- cimetidine
?
figure 3* -- -- example 44
figure 4* -- -- tiotidine
?
figure 5* -- -- intermediate compound
the district_court correctly rejected danburys argument
specifically danbury did not show sufficient_motivation for one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of invention to take any one of the following steps let alone the entire complex combination 1 selecting example 44 as a lead_compound 2 combining the polar_tail *1345 from example 44 with the substituted_heterocycle from tiotidine and 3 substituting the carbamoyl conh2 group in the intermediate_compound with a sulfamoyl_group so2nh2 to create famotidine

at the outset danbury did not show the required motivation for selecting example 44 as a lead_compound
danburys assertion of motivation rests on the fact that example 44 is three times more active than cimetidine
that activity alone however is not sufficient_motivation
as the trial_court noted other prior_art references disclosed compounds with h2_antagonist_activity up to ten times higher than cimetidine
see yamanouchi 21 f.supp.2d at 373
if activity alone was the sole motivation other more active compounds would have been the obvious choices not example 44

danbury also does not show the motivation to combine the polar_tail of example 44 with the substituted_heterocycle of tiotidine then to substitute the carbamoyl with a sulfamoyl
to show such motivation danbury argues only that an ordinary_medicinal_chemist would have reasonably expected the resulting compound to exhibit the baseline_level of h2_antagonist_activity
the baseline_level of activity is a mere 1/165th the activity of cimetidine
this level of motivation does not show a` reasonable_expectation of success'
in re_longi 759 f.2d at 897
the success of discovering famotidine was not discovering one of the tens of thousands of compounds that exhibit baseline h2_antagonist_activity
rather the success was finding a compound that had high_activity few side_effects and lacked toxicity
as danburys expert testified the ordinary_medicinal_chemist would not have expected famotidine to have the` most desirable combination of pharmacological properties' that it possesses
j.a.at 1052

furthermore the prior_art offers no suggestion to pursue the particular order of manipulating parts of the compounds
danburys proposed obvious course of invention requires a very specific series of steps
any deviation in the order of combination would have taught away from famotidine
if for instance the sulfamoyl_group were substituted for the carbamoyl group on example 44 without attaching the substituted_heterocycle from tiotidine the evidence showed that the resulting compound would have 1/100th the activity of cimetidine
famotidine on the other hand has 40 times the activity of cimetidine
danbury offered no evidence suggesting what might have led an ordinary artisan in this field to follow the precise steps that produced a remarkable invention

danbury falls far short of satisfying its burden of showing a prima_facie_case for structural obviousness by clear and convincing_evidence
instead as the district_court aptly concluded this case` has all the earmarks of somebody looking at this from hindsight'
yamanouchi 21 f.supp.2d at 370
because danbury did not show even a prima_facie_case for obviousness this court has considered but need not separately address the strong objective evidence of non-obviousness

b
on appeal danbury contends that the district_court improperly rejected its request to examine the inventor of the408_patent dr._yanagisawa and thereby abridged its right to be fully heard
at trial danbury proffered that dr._yanagisawas testimony would show an alleged distortion in his data provided to the u.s. patent and trademark office
the alleged distortion according to danbury would prove that tiotidine is actually more active than famotidine

upon review this court concludes that the district_court did not abuse its discretion in excluding dr._yanagisawa as a witness
under rule 52 c` the right to befully heard does not amount to a right to introduce every shred of evidence that a party wishes without regard to the probative value of that evidence'
first va. banks inc. v. bp exploration & oil inc. 206_f.3d_404 407 4th cir.2000 ; see granite *1346 state ins co. v. smart modular tech. inc. 76_f.3d_1023 1031 9th cir.1996
moreover the advisory_committee_notes clarify that the rule` authorizes the court to enter judgment at any time that it can appropriately make a dispositive_finding of fact on the evidence'
fed.r.civ.p
52 advisory_committee_notes 1991 amendment

in the present_case the district_court made a dispositive_finding that the record showed no motivation to combine the prior_art in the way suggested by danbury
dr._yanagisawas testimony would not bear on this dispositive_finding
rather danburys own_expert dr._loev testified that famotidine is more active than tiotidine-a position directly contrary to what danbury stated would be shown by dr._yanagisawas testimony
further danbury on appeal admitted that it had an opportunity to notice and depose dr._yanagisawa but did not do so

accordingly this court agrees with the district_courts finding that danbury was fully heard within the meaning of rule 52 c
this court therefore affirms the district_courts grant of jmol sustaining the validity of claim 4 of the408_patent

iii
this court reviews the district_courts decision to award attorney_fees under an abuse of discretion standard
see avia group int l. inc. v. l.a. gear cal. inc. 853_f.2d_1557 1567 7_uspq2d_1548 1556 fed.cir.1988
under that standard this court affirms the district_courts decision unless the courts decision is clearly unreasonable arbitrary or fanciful or based on an erroneous conclusion of law or fact
see heat & control inc. v. hester indus. inc. 785_f.2d_1017 1022 228_uspq_926 930 fed.cir.1986 citations omitted

at the outset this court recognizes that the hatch-waxman_act authorizes an award of attorney_fees to the prevailing party in exceptional_cases on the basis of an anda_filing
as an initial matter title 35 recognizes that the submission of an anda` shall be an act of infringement.. if the purpose of such submission is to obtain approval under such act to engage in the commercial_manufacture use or sale of a drug.. claimed in a patent.. before the expiration of such patent'
35 u.s.c.¡± 271 e 2 emphasis added
thus under the terms of the act an anda_filer may infringe without even engaging in any actual commercial activities
the mere act of filing an anda constitutes infringement

the act also permits an award of attorney_fees for infringement by an anda_filing
section 271 e 4 states` for an act of infringement described in paragraph 2.. a court may award attorney_fees under section 285'
section 285 in turn provides` the court in exceptional_cases may award reasonable attorney_fees to the prevailing party'
35 u.s.c.¡± 285
the` paragraph 2' infringement specified in ¡± 271 e 4 is the filing of an anda
accordingly the act unambiguously permits an award of attorney_fees to the prevailing party in exceptional_cases on the basis of an anda_filing

in fact the act singles out paragraph 2 infringement - anda_filings - as a basis for an attorney fee award
in the same section the act allows damages and other monetary relief` only if there has been commercial_manufacture use offer to sell or sale within the united_states.. of an approved drug'
35 u.s.c.¡± 271 e 4 c
yet with regard to paragraph 2 infringement the act incorporates no such restriction but rather authorizes fee awards
accordingly the act itself does not limit an award of attorney_fees for paragraph 2 infringement to cases involving infringing commercial sales
see 35 u.s.c.¡± 271 e 4

as noted above section 271 e 4 authorizes fee awards for paragraph 2 infringement in accordance with the standards for section 285 exceptional_cases
this court in turn has recognized many varieties of misconduct that make a case exceptional for a fee award
these forms *1347 of misconduct include willful_infringement see e.g. avia 853 f.2d at 1567 ; rosemount inc. v. beckman_instruments inc. 727_f.2d_1540 1548 221_uspq_1 8-9 fed.cir.1984 inequitable conduct before the pto offensive litigation tactics vexatious or unjustified litigation or frivolous filings see hoffmann-la roche inc. v. invamed inc. 213_f.3d_1359 1365 54_uspq2d_1846 1850 fed.cir.2000 ; beckman_instruments inc. v. lkb produkter ab 892_f.2d_1547 1551 13_uspq2d_1301 1304 fed.cir.1989

in the present_case the district_court determined that danburys conduct amounted to willful_infringement
see yamanouchi 21 f.supp.2d at 376
an anda_filing by its very nature is a` highly artificial act of infringement' therefore the trial_court need not have elevated the anda certification into a finding of willful_infringement
see eli_lilly & co. v. medtronic inc. 496_u.s._661 678 110_s.ct._2683 110_l.ed.2d_605 15_uspq2d_1121 1130 1990
rather danburys misconduct in filing a wholly unjustified anda certification and misconduct during the litigation that followed warranted the district_courts finding that this case was exceptional

the joint operation of ¡±¡± 271 e and 285 require the paragraph 2 infringer to display care and regard for the strict standards of the hatch-waxman_act when challenging patent validity
as already noted the hatch-waxman_act authorizes challenges to the validity of patents in accordance with strict statutory requirements
specifically a paragraph iv filing requires` a certification in the opinion of the applicant and to the best of his knowledge [ that ] each patent.. for which the applicant is seeking approval.. is invalid'
21 u.s.c.¡± 355 j 2 a vii iv emphasis added
the hatch-waxman_act thus imposes a duty of care on an anda certifier
thus a case initiated by a paragraph 2 filing like any other form of infringement litigation may become exceptional if the anda_filer makes baseless certifications

this court concludes that the district_courts finding that danbury made a baseless certification is not clearly erroneous
in the first place danburys case for obviousness presented at trial contained glaring weaknesses precipitating a jmol
the anda certification notice and its supporting affidavits upon which danbury relies to show that it had a good faith belief in invalidity suffer similar weaknesses
the certification statute requires notice to the patentee of` the factual and legal basis' of invalidity
see 21 u.s.c.¡± 355 j 2 b ii
danburys notice does not present a prima_facie_case of invalidity and makes no reference to famotidines potency safety and lack of side_effects among other distinguishing properties accompanying its unusually high_activity
see yamanouchi 21 f.supp.2d at 376
`` moreover dr._loev admitted at trial that as of 1992 he could not tell from [ famotidines ] chemical structure whether it would be toxic nor predict its lack of side_effects
he further testified that he could not predict the effects on potency that would be caused by the structural manipulations he claimed to be obvious'
id
when danbury proceeded in the face of these weaknesses its certification amounted to baseless and unjustified misconduct
in certifying invalidity danbury disregarded its duty to exercise due care

in assessing whether a case qualifies as exceptional the district_court must look at the totality of the circumstances
see kaufman co. inc. v. lantech inc. 807_f.2d_970 at 978-79 1_uspq2d_1202 1208 fed.cir.1986
these circumstances include danburys choice to produce during trial a 1993 opinion from its patent attorney mr. alfred b. engelberg
this legal opinion contained an acknowledged error in chemistry which was critical to its conclusion of obviousness
danburys own_expert dr._loev conceded at trial that` engelbergs interpretation of the [408 ] patent was patently incorrect and that the [408 ] patent nowhere described the formulation relied upon by engelberg'
see yamanouchi 21 f.supp.2d at 376

*1348 based on the foregoing the district_court properly found that danburys anda_filing was` without adequate_foundation and speculative at best'
yamanouchi 21 f.supp.2d at 376
the district_court thus found the case` exceptional' and awarded attorney_fees to yamanouchi
this court detects no abuse of discretion by the district_court in its award
this court therefore affirms the district_courts award of attorney_fees to yamanouchi

conclusion
because the prior_art does not render obvious claim 4 of the408_patent this court affirms the district_courts grant of jmol upholding its validity
moreover because the district_court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney_fees this court affirms

costs
each party shall bear its own costs
