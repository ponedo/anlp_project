i
the polymerase chain reaction pcr allows scientists beginning with a small amount of deoxyribonucleic acid dna to generate many copies of that dna in a *1358 short period of time
the ability of pcr to synthesize dna rapidly has led to significant advances in molecular biology and has been particularly useful in pathology and in the identification of trace materials such as blood and hair

in the first stage of pcr a segment of dna is separated at high temperature into its two component strands
then at a lower temperature small pieces of synthetic dna called` primers' are annealed to specific locations on the separated strands
enzymes known as dna_polymerases then` extend' the primers by attaching a complementary nucleotide to each nucleotide in the template_strand
in this manner the polymerase creates two identical double-stranded dna helices from the two separated single strands of the original helix
the process of strand_separation primer annealment and extension is then performed repeatedly resulting in the production of a large number of identical dna strands

when pcr was first developed the high_temperatures associated with strand_separation destroyed the polymerase that was used to drive the reaction
accordingly new polymerase had to be added at the beginning of each cycle of the reaction which was cumbersome
it was subsequently discovered that the dna_polymerase of the thermus_aquaticus or` taq' bacterium which is found in geysers and hot springs was stable and active at high_temperatures and therefore could withstand the rigors of pcr
thus taq needed to be added to the reaction_mixture only once which resulted in making the pcr process much faster and more efficient

on june_17,_1987 cetus corporation the predecessor of appellants hoffmann-la_roche inc. and roche_molecular_systems inc. collectively` roche' filed u.s. patent application no._07 /063,509` the ¡¬509_application' which was directed to a purified thermostable enzyme
the ¡¬509_application named dr. david gelfand the cetus scientist most knowledgeable about the taq_enzyme and ms. susanne stoffel dr._gelfands technician as inventors
the broadest originally filed claim was not limited to the taq_enzyme

in an office_action dated november 1 1988 the examiner rejected all the submitted claims on a variety of grounds
the rejections included an anticipation/obviousness rejection based on journal articles by chien et_al. and kaledin et_al. both of which disclosed a dna_polymerase derived from the taq_bacterium
the examiner noted that the applicants included molecular_weight limitations in dependent claims and that those limitations differed from the estimates of taqs molecular_weight reported by chien and kaledin
the examiner suggested that` some proteins behave anomalously when subjected to sds page' the technique used by the applicants to estimate molecular_weight
for that reason the examiner concluded that` [ i ] t is not clear whether or not the molecular_weight an [ d ] ph range of activity claimed by applicants for the instant enzyme is a result of experimental parameters or an enzyme activity different than the [ enzyme ] previously described in the literature'

on march_17,_1989 the inventors responded to the examiners rejection canceling all pending claims and entering three new claims the broadest of which provided as follows 1
purified thermostable_thermus_aquaticus_dna_polymerase that migrates on a denaturing_polyacrylamide_gel faster than phosphorylase_b and more slowly than does bovine_serum_albumin and has an estimated molecular_weight of 86,000-90,000 daltons when compared with a phosphorylase_b_standard *1359 assigned a molecular_weight of 92,500 daltons
u.s._patent_no._4889,818 col._44,_ll._46-52

in remarks accompanying the amendment the applicants made a two-part argument for patentability
first they asserted that the claimed enzyme was distinct from the prior_art_enzyme citing differences in molecular_weight specific_activity and fidelity
second they contended that even if contrary to their belief the claimed and prior_art_enzymes were identical the claimed enzyme would still be patentable because it was` far more pure' than the enzyme of the chien and kaledin preparations
to support that assertion the inventors cited a portion of the application indicating that the claimed enzyme had a specific_activity ten times that of the prior_art_enzyme

the examiner allowed the amended claims without further comment
the ¡¬509_application therefore issued as u.s._patent_no._4889,818` the ¡¬818_patent` on december 26 1989

cetus licensed the ¡¬818_patent to promega corporation in june 1990
after cetus sold the ¡¬818_patent to roche promega allegedly breached the license agreement
roche filed suit alleging patent infringement and breach of contract
promega counterclaimed asserting inter alia that the ¡¬818_patent was unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct a claim that soon became the focus of the litigation

in august 1996 the district_court held on summary_judgment that the inventors had made four material_misrepresentations during the prosecution of the ¡¬818_patent
after a bench trial the court held that the ¡¬818_patent was unenforceable based on eight separate misrepresentations and omissions including three of the ones the court had addressed at the summary_judgment_stage
roche appeals the courts order holding the patent unenforceable

ii
a party seeking to have a patent declared unenforceable has a heavy burden to meet
inequitable conduct requires misrepresentation or omission of a material_fact together with an intent to deceive the pto
both of those distinct elements must be shown by clear and convincing_evidence
see manville sales corp. v. paramount sys. inc. 917_f.2d_544 552 16_uspq2d_1587 1593 fed.cir.1990 ; kingsdown med consultants ltd. v. hollister_inc. 863_f.2d_867 872 9_uspq2d_1384 1389 fed.cir.1988
once the requisite levels of materiality and intent are shown the district_court must determine whether the equities warrant a conclusion that the patentee has engaged in inequitable_conduct
molins_plc v. textron inc. 48_f.3d_1172 1178 33_uspq2d_1823 1827 fed.cir.1995

while it is difficult to prove inequitable_conduct a district_courts ruling on inequitable_conduct is reviewed deferentially
the courts findings on materiality and intent are reviewed for clear_error and thus will not be overturned in the absence of a` definite and firm conviction' that a mistake has been made
molins 48 f.3d at 1178 33 uspq2d at 1827
the district_courts assessment of the equities is reviewed for an abuse of discretion
id

the district_court in this case based its inequitable_conduct ruling on its finding that the inventors made various material_misrepresentations and related omissions which can be grouped into three categories 1 representations regarding the difference in molecular_weight between the claimed and prior_art taq_enzymes ; 2 representations that the inventors had performed example_vi one of the procedures described in the specification and that they had achieved the described results ; and 3 representations concerning the comparative fidelity and template dependence *1360 of the claimed enzyme and the prior_art_enzymes

we analyze each of the three categories of asserted inequitable_conduct below upholding the district_courts findings as to two of the three and overturning the courts findings as to the third
the dissent which would overturn the district_courts findings with respect to all three categories criticizes us for failing to apply the clear and convincing standard of proof in assessing the evidence of materiality and intent
while we recognize the standard of proof that applies to those factual issues we also note that our task as a reviewing court is not to make those factual determinations in the first instance but to determine whether the district_courts findings on those issues are clearly erroneous or are infected with legal error
with that standard of review in mind we turn to each of the grounds on which the district_court based its ruling

a. molecular weight
in their response to the examiners office_action the inventors argued that the claimed enzyme was different from the enzyme described in the cited references
their argument focused principally on the disparity in the molecular_weight values reported for the prior_art_enzymes and the claimed enzyme
the inventors noted that claim 1 of the ¡¬509_application recited an enzyme with a molecular_weight of 86 000_to_90000 daltons while the chien and kaledin references described enzymes with molecular_weights of 63,000-68,000 daltons and 60,000-62,000 daltons respectively
the inventors proffered an explanation for the discrepancy they believed that at most chien and kaledin had isolated a` crude preparation of degraded taq_polymerase'
the district_court however concluded on summary_judgment that the inventors had withheld information from the pto that tended to show that the enzymes chien and kaledin had isolated were not simply degraded fragments of taq_polymerase and thus made it less clear that the chien and kaledin enzymes were distinguishable from the enzyme described in the application

1
the stoffel experiment
the dispute over the disparity in reported molecular_weights relates in part to an experiment that ms._stoffel performed in which she applied a protein sample to a phosphocellulose_column
she observed that a taq_fragment with a molecular_weight of 62,000 daltons did not bind to the phosphocellulose_column
according to the district_court the results of that experiment undercut the inventors statement in the march_17,_1989 office_action_response that the chien article referred to a degraded_form of taq
in the district_courts view the fact that the taq_fragment did not bind to ms._stoffels phosphocellulose_column indicated that a similar fragment would have been` lost' in the experiment described by chien because that experiment also used a column of phosphocellulose
the district_court therefore concluded that the stoffel_experiment suggested that the enzyme described in the prior_art_references was not a degraded_form of taq as the inventors contended
for that reason the court determined that the inventors should have replicated the prior_art experiment before characterizing it as producing a taq_fragment with a lower molecular_weight

roche argues that there were genuine issues of material_fact regarding the materiality of the stoffel_experiment and that the issue should not have been decided on summary_judgment
we agree
two key facts are undisputed
first the ability of a particle to bind to a phosphocellulose_column depends upon the initial_salt_concentration of the buffer in which the phosphocellulose_column is suspended
promegas *1361 expert dr._mosbaugh concurred with roches evidence on that point
second the initial_salt_concentration of the stoffel_experiment 80 mm differed significantly from that described in the chien_reference 10 mm
because the stoffel_experiment was conducted under conditions very different from those described in the chien_reference it is not clear that the results of the stoffel_experiment were pertinent to the inventors characterization of the prior_art_enzyme
because the district_court improperly concluded as matter of law that the stoffel_experiment was material the portion of the district_courts summary_judgment order relating to the materiality of the stoffel_experiment can not be sustained

we also must reverse the district_courts finding of intent with respect to the stoffel_experiment
following trial the court found that the inventors intended to deceive the pto when they failed to disclose the results of the stoffel_experiment to the examiner
roche characterizes that finding as clearly erroneous and we agree
the evidence does not demonstrate that the inventors intended to deceive the pto by suppressing the results of the stoffel_experiment
instead it shows that they believed that the initial_salt_concentration in such an experiment was critical to the capacity of the fragment to bind to the column and that the low initial_salt_concentration used in the chien experiment rendered the stoffel_experiment not comparable and the results of the stoffel_experiment not pertinent to patentability

the evidence showed for example that when one of dr._gelfands colleagues had difficulty with an enzyme sticking to the column he called dr._gelfand who concluded that it was possible the colleague had encountered a fragment and suggested reducing the salt_concentration to around 40 mm
the colleague stated that` [ t ] he suggestion from dr._gelfand was that the salt_concentration of the load in this column was probably too high
and in order to get that material to stick to the column one needed to lower the salt_concentration by dialyzing'
similarly ms._stoffel testified that experiments showed that the fragment did not bind when it was loaded at a salt_concentration of 80 mm but that` it stuck but it eluted earlier in the gradient' at a salt_concentration of 10 mm-the concentration in chiens experiment
when the inventors noted that the proteolyzed enzyme did not bind to phosphocellulose they included a reference to the restriction` at 80 mm salt' indicating that they considered the salt_concentration significant to the failure to bind
thus the record reflects that the enzymes ability to bind to the column is dependent on the initial_salt_concentration and that the inventors knew of that dependence and deemed it significant
this evidence as to the inventors state of mind stands as unrebutted proof that they did not think the results of the stoffel_experiment had any bearing on whether chien had isolated a fragment of the taq_enzyme
accordingly we conclude that the district_court committed clear_error in finding clear and convincing_evidence of intent to deceive in the inventors failure to disclose the stoffel_experiment

2
size exclusion chromatography
the district_court also ruled that the inventors improperly withheld four pieces of information that suggested that the technique chien used to determine molecular_weight-size exclusion chromatography-was inaccurate and produced results underestimating the true molecular_weight of chiens taq
in the district_courts view that information would have weakened the inventors argument that the claimed enzyme was distinct from the enzyme *1362 of the prior_art as evidenced by a difference in molecular_weight

in the size exclusion chromatography procedure in question a sample of the protein whose weight is to be estimated is introduced into a column filled with porous beads sometimes referred to as a` matrix'
a buffer solution is run through the column
the proteins in the sample that are larger than the pore size of the beads will flow around the beads and out the bottom of the column
the smaller proteins will enter the pores between the beads thus retarding their progress through the column
as a result the speed at which a protein` elutes' or moves through the column corresponds to its molecular_weight
the faster a protein moves through the column the greater its molecular_weight
if however a protein that otherwise would pass quickly through the matrix because of its large size has a chemical affinity for the matrix it may move through the column more slowly than would be expected resulting in an underestimation of its molecular_weight

according to the district_court the inventors had information suggesting that the taq_enzyme would have bound to the matrix used by chien in her size exclusion procedure
the district_court therefore concluded that the inventors knew that chiens molecular_weight value was potentially too low and that the difference between the claimed and prior_art_enzymes was less than the inventors asserted

the information to which the district_court pointed consisted of 1 the results of a purification experiment by ms._stoffel ; 2 a sizing_experiment by dr._drummond another cetus_employee ; 3 data concerning taqs hydrophobicity its tendency to avoid interacting with water ; and 4 an internal_memorandum by mr. raymond a cetus_employee
roche argues that the information marshaled by the district_court does not constitute evidence that taq would have bound to the matrix used by chien in her sizing_experiment and that the district_court improperly ruled in promegas favor on this issue
we agree
none of the information cited by the district_court tends to prove that taq would have bound to the particular type of matrix used by chien a product known as sephadex_g-100

the experiments conducted by dr._drummond and ms._stoffel used types of gels zorbax and ultrogel that differed from the type of gel used by chien
promegas expert on this subject dr. burgess conceded that the phenomenon of a protein binding to a matrix is dependent upon the specific chemistry between the matrix and the protein in question
promega introduced no evidence that the experiments that were conducted with zorbax and ultrogel shed any light on the manner in which sephadex and taq interact
the evidence therefore did not show that the experiments indicated that chiens taq would have bound to the matrix and produced inaccurate results
accordingly the district_court improperly held that the failure to disclose those experiments was a material_omission

the district_court also ruled that the inventors knowledge of taqs hydrophobicity was material to determining whether chiens sizing_experiment was accurate
roche contests that ruling claiming that taqs hydrophobicity is not probative of whether it would interact with a matrix composed of sephadex

it is undisputed that a proteins interaction with a particular sizing matrix depends not only on the properties of the protein but also on those of the matrix itself
in reaching the conclusion that taqs hydrophobicity would make it likely that it would have bound to sephadex the district_court did not consider the chemical properties of sephadex
that omission is *1363 critical
the only_evidence adduced at trial on that point was from roches expert dr._chamberlin who testified that the chemical composition of sephadex would make it unlikely to bind to a hydrophobic enzyme such as taq because sephadex is hydrophilic rather than hydrophobic
thus the record does not support the district_courts conclusion that taqs hydrophobic nature makes it likely that chiens sizing_experiment produced inaccurate molecular_weight estimates because there is no proof that taq is likely to bind to a matrix composed of sephadex_g-100
the courts finding on that issue is clearly erroneous

finally the district_court ruled on summary_judgment that the raymond_memorandum was material
that memorandum indicates that taq` migrates differently on sorbax [ sic zorbax ] or other_sizing_columns' and that a different technique sds-page is needed to get an accurate determination of molecular_weight
again however the raymond_memorandum does not indicate whether taq would interact with sephadex_g-100
the possibility that the raymond_memorandum was referring to sephadex when it mentioned` other_sizing_columns' is remote because there is no evidence that cetus ever conducted any sizing_experiments with that type of gel
furthermore roche contends that because sephadex has a significantly different chemistry than the types of gels cetus used extrapolating from the raymond_memorandum in the manner that the district_court did is improper
we conclude that at a minimum there is a genuine dispute of material_fact on this issue and we therefore hold that it was inappropriate for the district_court to resolve this question on summary_judgment
in sum we reverse the district_courts inequitable_conduct ruling to the extent that it relies on representations and omissions regarding the respective_molecular_weights of the prior_art and the claimed enzymes

b
example_vi
following trial the district_court found that the inventors committed inequitable_conduct by erroneously stating that they had performed a particular_purification_protocol and had obtained certain_results
example_vi is a procedure described in the ¡¬509_application for repeatedly refining or fractionating a bacterial culture of the taq_enzyme through a variety of techniques including column chromatography
according to example_vi the last of these` fractions' is the purified version of the claimed enzyme
example_vi concludes active_fractions with no detectable_nuclease s were pooled and run on a silver stained sds-page mini gel
the results show a single 88 kd_band with a specific_activity of 250,000 units/mg
this specific_activity is more than an order of magnitude higher than that claimed for the previously isolated taq_polymerase and is at least an order of magnitude higher than that for e. coli polymerase i. ¡¬818_patent col._41,_ll._12-20
the inventors further stated that` [ t ] he taq_polymerase purified as described above in example_vi was found to be free of any contaminating taq_endonuclease and exonuclease activities'
¡¬ 818 patent col._41,_ll._23-25

1
misrepresentations
example_vi is written in the past_tense
the inventors state for example that a certain_quantity of cells` were resuspended in 75 ml of a buffer' that the cells` were lysed in a french_press' ¡¬818_patent col._39,_ll._3-7 after which 300 ml of tris-edta` were added'
each step of the example over more than two columns *1364 of the patent is described in the same fashion using the past_tense
indeed the past_tense is used to describe the steps of example_vi on more than 75 occasions
e.g.` these steps were repeated and the protein suspension was dialyzed extensively' ;` the polymerase activity was assayed' ;` an assay.. was performed' ;` active_fractions with no detectable_nuclease s were pooled and run on a silver stained sdspage mini gel'
¡¬ 818 patent col._39,_ll._61-62 ; col._41,_ll._3-4 6-14
from the language used a reader of the patent would conclude that the protocol was performed and that the following results were actually achieved 1 the refined enzyme possessed` single-band_purity' ; 2 the purified enzyme was free from nuclease_activity ; 3 the enzyme had a specific_activity of approximately 250,000 units/mg ; and 4 the specific_activity of the enzyme was at least ten times that of the prior_art_enzyme

as a threshold matter roche suggests that the description of example_vi in the past_tense is not actually a misrepresentation and therefore that we need not inquire into the issues of intent and materiality
the district_court however specifically found that example_vi had not been performed as written and in light of the testimony adduced at trial that finding can not be held to be clearly erroneous

dr._gelfand admitted that example_vi was never performed as described q
well if you thought this was the best_way when did you ever do example 6 from start to finish exactly as written ?
you never have done example 6 from start to finish as written have you ever ?
a. susanne stoffel and i that is correct susanne stoffel and i never carried out example 6 from start to finish as laid out
ms._stoffels testimony was similar
since example_vi was never performed the inventors never obtained the described results

roche notes that the last sentence in the description of the procedure purportedly used in example_vi is in the present_tense` the results show a single 88 kd_band with a specific_activity of 250,000 units/mg`
because that sentence is in the present_tense roche argues a reader would understand that example_vi was a prophetic example and was not actually performed
that argument is entirely unpersuasive
after having described in great detail the process purportedly used in the experiment and the results obtained-all in the past_tense-the use of the present_tense in the single quoted sentence would be understood as a present characterization of results actually obtained in the past not as the inventors prediction of what such an experiment would show if it were performed

roche next suggests that the use of the past_tense in example_vi is not really a misrepresentation since all of the steps in that procedure were purportedly part of two procedures that roche did perform prep 3 and prep 4
specifically dr._gelfand stated that four of the five column_steps of example_vi were completed in prep 4 and the remaining step was performed at some point in prep 3

the district_court however rejected the argument that example_vi was in effect performed through the combination of prep 3 and prep 4
the court noted that gelfand and stoffel had` combined steps from [ prep 3 and prep 4 ] to arrive at example_vi' but the court made clear that it did not regard the combination of steps from those two preparations as constituting the performance of example_vi
in fact the court explained that the representation` that example_vi yielded a single *1365 88 kd_band on an sds_page_mini-gel was necessarily a misstatement because the inventors had not in fact performed example_vi of the patent'

while promegas expert_witness dr._linn conceded that the inventors did each of the column_steps at some point he also noted that they were not done in the order specified in example_vi
moreover dr._mosbaugh testified that the order of the steps is important and that the addition or deletion of a step would affect the collection of proteins a significant result
he stated that` its not just a matter of doing five steps
its important what those five steps are the order in which theyre carried out'
dr._mosbaugh examined the details of the steps and noted that there were many differences in how the two final columns in prep 4 were` handled and evaluated relative to what the patent says' in example_vi
when asked about the predictive value of prep 3_and_4 with regard to example_vi dr._mosbaugh stated that one` can not fuse these together and get any prediction as to what the outcome would be'
he concluded that` they did n't do example 6 as reported in the patent ; [ ] what they did do that is [ prep ] 3 and [ prep ] 4 will not get you in my opinion to example 6'
roche offered no evidence contradicting the importance of the order of the steps the differences within the steps and the conclusion that the results of prep 3 and prep 4 would not provide an accurate representation of the results of a procedure conducted according to example_vi
accordingly although roche attempts to convert the district_courts finding that the inventors generated example_vi by combining steps from prep 3 and prep 4 into a finding that by performing prep 3 and prep 4 they had in effect performed example_vi that effort runs headlong into the district_courts repeated findings that example_vi was never performed
and as noted that finding was supported by evidence and can not be deemed clearly erroneous

nor is there force to roches argument that the results reported in example_vi are consistent with the results of other experiments that had actually been performed
with respect to the assertion in example_vi that the inventors derived an enzyme exhibiting single-band_purity dr._mosbaugh stated that even improved protocols for purity failed to achieve single-band_purity
he also noted that when outside contractors performed example_vi they encountered multiple bands
roches expert_witness dr._chamberlin testified that he did not see a gel from either prep 3 or prep 4 with only a single_band
additionally while ms._stoffel asserted that she achieved a single_band in prep 4 dr._gelfand conceded that in prep 4 they obtained a major band but that` it was not the only band
there were some other very faint_bands'
based on that testimony the district_court permissibly concluded that the representation that example_vi yielded a single_band was a significant deviation from the information known to the inventors

the district_court reached a similar conclusion with respect to the assertion in the specification that example_vi resulted in a nuclease-free preparation
in particular the court found that the representations that` [ a ] ctive fractions with no detectable_nuclease s were pooled and run on a silver stained sds_page_mini-gel' and that` [ t ] he taq_polymerase purified as described above in example_vi was found to be free of any contaminating taq_endonuclease and exonuclease activities' were false
the court noted that while the inventors relied on the results of prep 4 to support those claims ms._stoffel and roches expert admitted that the enzyme that resulted from that procedure was not nuclease-free
roches expert dr._chamberlin *1366 testified that there was detectable endonuclease_activity
ms._stoffel testified that prep 4 contained only a` very small' or` minimal' amount of nucleases but promegas expert_witness dr._linn characterized the contamination of that preparation as substantial
in light of this testimony on which the district_court relied it was not clearly erroneous for the district_court to conclude that the inventors did not achieve a nuclease-free polymerase in any experiment that they actually conducted

the district_court was also justified in concluding that the inventors assertion that they had achieved an enzyme with a specific_activity of approximately 250,000 units/mg was false
example_vi specifically states that a` unit' is equal to` 10 nm of product in 30 minutes'
the court found at the summary_judgment_stage however that the 250,000 value corresponded to a different definition of a` unit' and it held that under the definition set forth in example_vi the correct value should have been recited as 100,000 units/mg
the district_court noted that dr._gelfand gave conflicting accounts of the source of the specific_activity value reported in example_vi
in a declaration submitted to the court dr._gelfand asserted that the value was obtained according to the conditions recited in example_vi
in a prior declaration submitted to the pto however dr._gelfand stated that the results of example_vi were obtained from an experiment based on the assay_conditions listed in example i also in the ¡¬509_application
in reality neither of those statements was true for it appears that the 250,000 number was based on an experiment performed by ms._stoffel in which she obtained a result of 248,000 units/mg

the stoffel_experiment does not however prove that the specific_activity_result of example_vi is grounded in an actual experimental result
although dr._gelfand testified that ms._stoffels result was 200,000 units/mg` under the new unit definitions' that testimony does not prove that the new unit definition was the same as the one used in example_vi nor does it prove that the stoffel_experiment was conducted under conditions equivalent to those described in example_vi
roches claim that another experiment measured a specific_activity of approximately 390,000 units/mg also fails for similar reasons because there is no proof that that experiment was performed under conditions equivalent to example_vi with a per milligram specific_activity value approaching 250,000` units' as that term is defined in example_vi
thus roche has not met its burden of demonstrating that the district_court clearly erred in determining that the inventors stated specific_activity_result was a misrepresentation

finally the evidence supports the courts finding that the inventors comparison of the specific_activity of the claimed and prior_art_enzymes was deceptive
the application stated that the specific_activity of the claimed enzyme as purified according to example_vi was at least ten times that of the prior_art_enzyme
the inventors repeated that argument in the march_17,_1989 office_action_response as an alternative argument for patentability
based on dr._mosbaughs testimony however the court found that the comparison was invalid because the two enzymes were not assayed under the same conditions
the court also found that the contrary testimony of roches witness dr._chamberlin was not credible
there is no clear_error in that determination

intent
misrepresentations by themselves are not enough to render a patent unenforceable ; the misrepresentations must be *1367 intentional and they must be material to patentability
with regard to the element of intent roche has not demonstrated clear_error in the district_courts finding
the inventors attested that all statements made in the ¡¬509_application were true
there was no suggestion by roche that the use of the past_tense in example_vi was an oversight-dr._gelfand admitted he understood that at least in a scientific_publication the use of the past_tense means that an experiment was actually performed
he provided no reasonable explanation as to why a different_principle would apply in a patent_application
nor did roche introduce any other evidence to explain why the past_tense was used to describe an experiment that was not performed
accordingly the district_court did not clearly err in determining that the inventors use of the past_tense in example_vi was knowingly false

roche contends that example_vi was included in the application because it represented the best_mode of practicing the invention disclosure of which is required by 35 u.s.c.¡± 112
the best_mode_requirement however does not entitle the inventor to suggest that the best_mode has been performed when it has not and to report results that have not actually been observed

roche attaches great significance to the fact that the district_court found that the inventors had a good_faith_belief that they had discovered a different enzyme than that described in the prior_art arguing that` [ b ] ecause one can not intentionally deceive by representing what one honestly believes the district_courts judgment can not stand'
roche misapprehends the import of that finding by the district_court
the inventors may indeed have believed they had discovered a novel enzyme but that belief does not permit them to make misrepresentations in seeking to persuade the examiner to issue a patent for that enzyme
thus the district_courts finding that the inventors had a good_faith_belief in the novelty of their invention is not incompatible with a finding of deceptive_intent

3
materiality
as to the materiality element of inequitable_conduct roche argues that because the ¡¬818_patent did not include claim limitations directed to purity representations about purity made in the application can not be material
materiality however is not limited to matters reflected in the claims of a patent
see perseptive biosystems inc. v. pharmacia biotech inc. 225_f.3d_1315 1322 56_uspq2d_1001 1006 fed.cir.2000
rather information is material when there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable_examiner would consider it important in deciding whether to allow the application to issue
id.at 1321 56 uspq2d at 1006
moreover the information at issue with respect to example_vi consisted of affirmative_misrepresentations not omissions as was the case with respect to the issue of molecular_weight
this court has held that affirmative_misrepresentations by the patentee in contrast to misleading omissions are more likely to be regarded as material
rohm & haas co. v. crystal chem co. 722_f.2d_1556 1571 220_uspq_289 300 fed.cir.1983

in the office_action_response the inventors argued that even if the claimed enzyme was not distinct from the prior_art_enzyme` [ a ] pplicants would still be entitled to a patent because the present_preparations are far more pure` than the prior_art_enzyme citing the comparison of specific_activity made in the patent_application
purity was therefore a prominent albeit an alternative argument in favor of patentability
indeed the prosecuting attorney testified that the argument regarding *1368 purity was made in order to allow amendments in the event that the examiner did not allow the existing claim
the district_court based its finding of materiality on that ground` since cetus argued that the patent could issue based on the asserted purity limitation a reasonable_examiner would have considered important information which indicated that cetus had overstated the level of purity of the claimed enzyme'

the courts determination is not clearly erroneous
the fact that the examiner did not have to rely on the purity representations in issuing the patent is not inconsistent with a finding of materiality
see merck & co. v. danbury pharmacal inc. 873_f.2d_1418 1421 10_uspq2d_1682 1686 fed.cir.1989 rejecting a` but for' standard of materiality
although the inventors statements regarding purity were not the principal focus of the office_action_response they were clearly an important aspect of it
under the circumstances a reasonable_examiner would have wanted to know that the patentability argument based on purity was unsupported by the experimental_results cited by the inventors.1 thus the purity results reported in example_vi and the reference to them in the office_action_response were central enough to the prosecution to be` within a reasonable_examiners realm of consideration'
id.2

c. comparison of fidelity
the district_court next focused on the inventors comparison of the fidelity and template_dependency of the claimed enzyme and the prior_art_enzymes
a dna_polymerase is said to be` template dependent' if it has the ability to read the identity of a nucleotide in the template_strand of dna and then synthesize the appropriate complementary_base pair
fidelity relates to the accuracy of the dna_polymerase in adhering to the complementary_base-pairing during synthesis
a polymerase exhibits a higher_fidelity when it experiences fewer misincorporation events *1369 which are mistaken base-pairings
a template-dependent high_fidelity dna_polymerase will exhibit little or no activity when one of the four types of nucleotides is absent from the reaction_mixture
the polymerase will incorporate nucleotides until it encounters a position on the template for which the corresponding complement is not available
at that point the polymerase will effectively stop working because it can not perform the synthesis operation correctly causing experimental_results of less than one hundred percent_incorporation

in the ¡¬509_application the inventors posited that their claimed enzyme exhibited high_fidelity while the prior_art_enzyme experienced misincorporation
the inventors stated that when only one or more nucleotide triphosphates were eliminated from a dna_polymerase_assay_reaction_mixture very little if any activity was observed using the enzyme herein and the activity was consistent with the expected value and with an enzyme exhibiting high_fidelity
in contrast the activity observed using the kaledin_et_al
( supra enzyme is not consistent with the expected value and suggests misincorporation of nucleotide triphosphate s
¡¬818_patent col._30,_ll._23-31
the inventors made a similar assertion in their march_17,_1989 office_action_response the data in the.. [ prior_art_references ] would lead one of ordinary_skill in the art to conclude that the enzymes described in these references are not suitable for template-directed in vitro dna_synthesis because the enzymes have a rather substantial_promiscuous_ability to synthesize dna on a natural dna template in the absence of one of the four deoxynucleoside_triphosphates
the taq_polymerase of the present invention has an activity quite different from and superior to the activity of the polymerase described by [ the prior_art_references ]
on page 47 lines 6-12 of the specification applicants point out that the purified taq_polymerase of the invention has little or no activity in a dna_polymerase_assay_reaction_mixture that does not contain one of the four deoxynucleoside_triphosphates
that assertion was made to support the contention that the claimed enzyme was different from the prior_art_enzyme cited by the examiner
the claim of greater fidelity was therefore intended to demonstrate along with the purported difference in molecular_weight that the claimed enzyme was not the same as the enzyme described in the prior_art_references and accordingly was patentable

while it appears that the applicants statements about the fidelity of their own enzyme were accurate the district_court found that the statements characterizing the activity of the prior_art_enzymes and comparing it to that of the claimed enzyme were inaccurate
that finding is not clearly erroneous
promegas expert_witness dr._kunkel testified that the kaledin and chien experiments are` not indicative of an enzyme that is not suitable for template-directed in vitro synthesis' but instead indicate just the opposite
dr._kunkel also addressed the applicants representations that the prior_art_enzyme had a substantial_promiscuous_ability which in the field of fidelity measurements suggests misincorporation and that the reported activity_levels indicated misincorporation.3 *1370 dr._kunkel explained how kaledins and chiens levels of incorporation recorded in the absence of one of the nucleotides did not reflect misincorporation events but rather that the enzyme was incorporating until the missing nucleotide was needed for a base-pairing
based on an examination of the structure of the template used by kaledin dr._kunkel reported that the results that kaledin obtained were as anticipated given the nature of the experiment and that the experiment in no way indicated misincorporation

according to dr._kunkel the differing results referred to by the inventors in the office_action_response related to differences in experimental conditions specifically differences in the dna templates used and not to differences in the properties of the enzymes
for example dr._kunkel explained that the template used by kaledin and chien was a mixture of double- and single-stranded dna with various short single-stranded gaps and that the synthesis began at a different point in each molecule
therefore there were as few as 21 total incorporation events in one example
in a particular instance dr._kunkel testified a gap may not even require the missing nucleotide and would incorporate fully adhering to the complementary_base-pairing and not misincorporating
this would result in activity_levels closer to 100 %
in contrast the template used by dr._gelfand is a long single-strand that the enzyme must copy with synthesis starting at the same point on all the molecules and approximately 7000 incorporation events
a low percentage of the total incorporation is likely then to occur before the missing nucleotide is needed resulting in lower activity_levels than in kaledin but not necessarily indicating a higher_fidelity
dr._kunkel explained that the results illustrated that both of the polymerases were template-dependent that kaledins and dr._gelfands results were as anticipated and that the percent_incorporation relative to the control is a function of the nature of the dna
in addition dr._kunkel described an experiment he conducted in which the same enzyme produced varying activity_levels when different_templates were used
according to dr._kunkel that experiment demonstrated that the different activity_levels found by kaledin and by the inventors resulted from the use of different_templates` illustrating the well-known principles taught in the literature that the difference in incorporation values that one gets are a function of the dna template that was used [ ] not a function of the polymerase that was used'
dr._kunkel testified that misincorporation could not be an explanation for the activity_levels that kaledin and chien were observing
roche did not offer expert testimony to contradict dr._kunkels statements

roche responds to the district_courts analysis of this issue by arguing that the inventors and dr._kunkel simply differed over how to interpret the results of the experiments involving the prior_art and claimed enzymes and that a dispute of that sort can not give rise to a finding of inequitable_conduct
roche however failed to make a persuasive showing that there was a legitimate difference of scientific opinion on that issue and that the district_court therefore committed clear_error in its findings

in its brief roche argues that a portion of dr._kunkels cross-examination together with a passage from the chien_reference itself supports the claim that the comparison between the enzymes was sound
roche argues that chien explained that her activity level results were related to the nature of the enzyme rather than to the template used
chien stated that the incorporation she observed with one nucleotide omitted is` higher than those reported for most bacterial polymerases but *1371 is similar to certain mammalian dna_polymerases
the incorporation probably represents the addition of two or three dttps to complementary ends'
however dr._kunkel stated that chiens use of the term` complementary' implies correct matching of base-pairs rather than misincorporation
thus chien fails to provide the requisite evidence that the district_court committed clear_error in rejecting dr._gelfands statement that the activity suggests misincorporation
roches argument and citation to chien fall far short of rebutting dr._kunkels detailed testimony on which the district_court relied
the court therefore did not clearly err in finding that the inventors misrepresented the prior_art_enzyme and its activity as compared to that of the claimed enzyme.4

we likewise uphold the district_courts finding of materiality with respect to the fidelity issue
the statement in the office_action_response was made in an effort to support the inventors primary argument for patentability-that the claimed enzyme was different from the prior_art_enzyme
the most prominent evidence cited by the inventors in this regard was a difference in molecular_weight but the alleged difference in fidelity was also argued at some length
given the prominence of that argument in the office_action_response the district_court did not clearly err in concluding that the misrepresentation made as part of that argument was material

the district_court found that the statements about fidelity were intentionally deceptive based primarily on testimony from dr._kunkel who worked with dr._gelfand and cetus
dr._kunkel stated that he was aware of dr._gelfands knowledge of template_dependency and fidelity and that dr._gelfand could not possibly believe that the experiments indicated that the prior_art_enzyme was promiscuous and not suitable for template-directed synthesis
dr._kunkel testified that he did not believe that a scientist aware of the information in the cetus records could truthfully make the statements found in the specification and office_action_response and that dr._gelfand was knowledgeable about that information
stating that the experiment done in the prior_art had nothing to do with fidelity or misincorporation and did not indicate that the prior_art_enzyme was not suitable for template-directed in vitro synthesis dr._kunkel noted that such information was` well known to persons who studied polymerases in the ¡¬70s and ¡¬80s'
in dr._kunkels words` with respect to fidelity the issue that i was just speaking to i feel very strongly that the that dr._gelfand knew better'

roche asserts that dr._kunkels testimony is not probative of intent and that the finding of intent can not stand because neither the inventors nor the prosecuting attorney were asked about that issue
intent however is typically proved inferentially molins_plc v. textron inc. 48_f.3d_1172 1180 33_uspq2d_1823 1828 fed.cir.1995 and a finding of intent does not require a confession from the stand by the inventor or the prosecuting attorney
the district_courts reliance on dr._kunkels testimony was entirely permissible
dr._kunkel is an expert in enzyme fidelity and was invited by dr._gelfand to visit cetus where he presented a seminar on the fidelity of taq
dr._kunkel had discussions with dr._gelfand on that subject both at cetus and at conferences where dr._kunkel presented
accordingly he was well positioned to testify as to dr._gelfands knowledge of fidelity and misincorporation
*1372 while dr._kunkel did not testify that he and dr._gelfand spoke about the specific subject of the impact of a template on the percentage incorporation occurring in the absence of one of the nucleotides it was permissible for the district_court to infer that dr._gelfand understood that relationship on the record before it
dr._kunkels testimony provided a sufficient basis for the district_courts conclusion that dr._gelfand had sufficient information to understand the import of the statements made in the specification and the office_action_response
the district_court did not clearly err in finding the requisite intent

we note that roche did not put forward evidence to contradict dr._kunkel as to whether the inventors interpretation was reasonable even though inaccurate
for example roche did not put forward testimony by another scientist in a position similar to dr._gelfand that a scientist studying polymerases could have misunderstood the data to indicate that the prior_art_enzymes were misincorporating and exhibiting a lower fidelity than the claimed enzyme
in particular dr._gelfand did not testify about his knowledge of fidelity or that he believed the statements made in the specification and in the office_action_response
we therefore have no evidentiary basis from which to conclude that it was clearly erroneous for the district_court to find that the assertions regarding fidelity were not legitimate or reasonable and that the inventors therefore intentionally sought to deceive the pto

iii
as we have explained an important step in the judicial resolution of inequitable_conduct claims is for the court to determine whether the material_misrepresentations or omissions in question are sufficiently serious in light of the evidence of intent to deceive under all the circumstances to warrant the severe sanction of holding the patent unenforceable
that determination is committed to the trial_courts discretion
in this case the trial_court did not expressly address this step in the inequitable_conduct analysis
for that reason and because we have not upheld all of the grounds on which the court found inequitable_conduct in this case we vacate the courts order of unenforceability and remand the case to the district_court for it to determine in the exercise of its judgment whether under all the circumstances the incidents of inequitable_conduct that we have sustained are such as to justify the sanction of rendering the ¡¬818_patent unenforceable

each party shall bear its own costs for this appeal

vacated and remanded

pauline newman circuit_judge dissenting
litigation-induced assaults on the conduct of science and scientists by aggressive advocates intent on destruction of reputation and property for private gain produced the past` plague' of charges of` inequitable_conduct'
a successful attack on the inventor or his lawyer will destroy the patent no matter how valid the patent and how sound the invention
the uncertainties of the processes of scientific_research the vagaries of the inductive method the complexities of patent procedures and the twists of hindsight all provided grist for this pernicious mill
indeed the prevalence of accusations of inequitable_conduct in patent cases led judges to suspect that all scientists are knaves and all patent attorneys jackals
today this court revives that misbegotten era

the federal_circuit having observed the ease with which ordinary actions in scientific_research or patent prosecution can be distorted by zealous attack established the requirement that the attacker make clear and convincing showings of both material_misrepresentation and deceptive *1373 intent
see kingsdown medical consultants ltd. v. hollister_inc. 863_f.2d_867 876 9_uspq2d_1384 1392 fed.cir.1988 there must be clear and convincing_evidence that material information was known to the inventor and was misrepresented or withheld for the purpose of deceiving or misleading the examiner into granting the patent
see also e.g. regents of the university of california v. eli_lilly & co. 119_f.3d_1559 1570 43_uspq2d_1398 1407 fed.cir.1997 ; scripps clinic & research found
v. genentech inc. 927_f.2d_1565 1582 18_uspq2d_1896_(fed.cir.1991)
today the court casts this safeguard aside finds misrepresentation in correct science infers malevolence from verb tense and grounds intent to deceive on personal slurs by a hostile_witness

these inventors made the discovery that the thermus_aquaticus enzyme has a quite different molecular_weight and specific_activity than had been reported in scientific_publications of a decade earlier
the taq_enzyme isolated and characterized by dr._gelfand and ms._stoffel had an activity over ten times that of the taq_enzyme previously reported
this discovery led cetus to commercial development of this important invention with promega obtaining a license
now attempting to destroy the patent promega attacks the competence as well as the integrity of the inventors

the patentability and validity of this discovery is not challenged
instead promega charges the inventors with inequitable_conduct in obtaining the patent focused on two areas
first promega asserts that more experiments should have been done by the inventors than were done particularly with respect to reproducing the prior_art
although promegas witnesses conceded that the inventors drew the correct conclusions promega argued successfully in the district_court that they should have performed certain additional experiments and that their failure to do so established omission misrepresentation and deceptive_intent
although the majority opinion properly rejects these attacks with respect to molecular_weight they have accepted them with respect to other properties

second the panel_majority finds grounds of inequitable_conduct in the presentation in the patent_application of a specific example that was a combination of two chromatographic purification procedures but did not say so
it is undisputed that the example works as written and that it was included in the patent_application because it was the best_mode known to the inventors who had previously distributed the procedure of this example to potential manufacturers
the panel_majority holds that because the example was not written entirely in the present_tense and identified as` prophetic' this establishes without more both material_misrepresentation and deceptive_intent

this case illustrates the ease of opportunistic challenge to the conduct of experimental science in patent context
my colleagues have distorted the patent process and the science it supports into a game of high stakes hindsight that few patents can survive
this additional risk to those who create valuable advances of science and technology has no countervailing public benefit for the only beneficiary is the infringer who destroys the patent
i must respectfully dissent

i. molecular weight
the panel_majority has reversed the district_courts rulings of inequitable_conduct based on molecular_weight.1 i concur in *1374 the majoritys decision with respect to this aspect and remark only that this record well illustrates the litigation tactic of probing the hundreds if not thousands of experimental_details scrutinizing every experiment performed and not performed criticizing everything done or undone and then charging that the research process was somehow fraudulent although there was no evidence of either misrepresentation or intent to deceive and the validity of the claims is not challenged

ii
example vi
example_vi describes a five-column chromatographic purification procedure for the taq_enzyme
this five-column procedure had been distributed to potential contractors for commercial production and was added to the specification in a continuation-in-part application in order to comply with the best_mode_requirement
there is no challenge to the district_courts finding that` gelfand and stoffel combined the steps from purifications numbered three and four to arrive at example_vi which they considered the best method for purifying taq'

a
example_vi is scientifically accurate
example_vi as written was a combination of the chromatographic_columns of two purification sequences designated as prep 3 and prep 4
prep 3 was the three-column purification of the taq_enzyme through a phosphocellulose_column a heparin sepharose column and a hydroxyapatite column
these are columns 1 2 and 3 of example_vi
the product of prep 3 had a specific_activity of 248,000 units/mg
prep 4 used the same first two columns of prep 3 plus a deae-trisacryl_column and a cm-trisacryl_column ; these are columns 1 2 4 and 5 of example_vi
the product of prep 4 had a specific_activity of 390,000 units/mg
thus example_vi combined the three columns of prep 3 with the four columns of prep 4 to form a five-column_purification_procedure and described the product as having the properties of the preparations that it embodied
at the time of filing of the patent_application example_vi had not been run by the inventors as it was written

the fatal flaw according to the panel_majority is that the entire example_vi was not written in the present_tense the code for` prophetic' or` paper' examples in the manual of patent_examining_procedure
the manual states that` simulated or predicted test_results and prophetical_examples paper_examples are permitted' and that the past_tense should not be used for paper_examples
mpep_¡± 608.01 p 8th ed. 20012 example_vi was written in the past_tense for the five chromatographic_columns and concluded by reporting some properties of the taq_enzyme in the present_tense
e.g.` the results show *1375 a single 88 kd_band with a specific_activity of 250,000 units/mg'
my colleagues rule that the use of the past_tense without more is a material_misrepresentation with deceptive_intent

example_vi is a faithful representation of the purification columns that were actually run
at trial roche offered extensive evidence comparing the inventors experimental data to example_vi
there was no evidence or suggestion that example_vi did not work as stated
promegas expert dr._mosbaugh compared prep 3 and prep 4 to example_vi ; he concluded that the inventors performed each of the chromatographic_steps of example_vi but stated that` its not just a matter of doing five steps
its important what those five steps are the order in which they¡¬re carried out'
dr._mosbaugh testified that he could not predict how such a combination of chromatographic_steps would perform although he did not disagree with dr._chamberlin expert_witness for roche and dr._linn expert_witness for promega both of whom testified that the five-column_purification_procedure using the third columns of prep 3 with the four columns of prep 4 would reasonably be expected to produce a product at least as pure as the four columns alone

my colleagues simply err in stating that there was` no evidence' that example_vi was accurately projected from preps 3_and_4
indeed the district_court made no such finding
although dr._mosbaugh stated that he was not capable of this projection this admission compared with the testimony of other witnesses including an expert for promega can not be clear and convincing_evidence that the inventors made a material_misrepresentation for the purpose of deception in making the accurate projection
the inventors believed and so testified that the combination of preps 3_and_4 would be an optimum procedure and added it to the disclosure because it was their best_mode
the issue before the court was not whether example_vi had been performed in complete sequence ; the issue was whether there was a misrepresentation material to patentability and whether the misrepresentation was made in order to deceive the examiner into granting the patent
the ascribed material_misrepresentation is not the data in the example but only the use of the past_tense
it was not disputed that the procedure and results of example_vi were supported by roches experimental data.3 there was no proffered evidence of deceptive_intent or basis for such an inference and no contradiction to the evidence that example_vi was added because the inventors believed it to be the best_mode

the panel_majority has selected some parameters from example_vi that it describes as` misrepresentations'
inspection negates this description
for example the panel_majority designates as misrepresentations the statements that` a certain_quantity of cellswere resuspended *big_token__1376_in_75__big_token ml of a buffer that cellswere lysed in a french_press after which 300 ml
of tris-edtawere added
`` maj. op.at 1364
in prep 3 the cells` were resuspended in 75 ml of a buffer' the cells were` lysed in a french_press' and 395 ml of tris-edta were added
the other criticisms by the panel_majority are equally trivial and at trial were devoid of even the accusation much less proof of deceptive_intent

example_vi was a protocol that had been written for use by manufacturers and had been given to those manufacturers as instructions for commercial scale purification of taq_polymerase
the inventors explained that example_vi was the best_mode and had already been distributed explaining why example_vi was added to the specification
evidence of the reason why an action was taken is highly relevant when fraudulent intent is charged
see kingsdown 863 f.2d at 876 9 uspq2d at 1392 good faith must always be considered
the district_court erred in ruling that` the fact that example_vi may have been a superior_method of purification is irrelevant' for it was the superior_method that led the inventors to include it in the patent

the panel_majority finds that the purity values in example_vi were not actually obtained because example_vi was not actually run and therefore challenges as fraudulent the statement that the product of example_vi has a specific_activity of approximately 250,000 units/mg
as i have mentioned the product of prep 3 had a specific_activity of about 248,000 and the product of prep 4 had a specific_activity of about 390,000 units/mg
although the majority questions how specific_activity was measured it was undisputed that these activities are comparable and that the specific_activity of the product of the example_vi procedure is at least as high as reported in example_vi

it was also undisputed that the inventors statement to the examiner that` the present_preparations [ of taq ] are far more pure than the chien et_al
and kaledin_et_al
preparations' was a true statement
the evidence was that dr._gelfand and ms._stoffel achieved approximately 8900-fold purification of taq from the crude t. aquaticus extracts whereas kaledin described 140-fold purification of his enzyme
comparison with chien was complicated by the addition of stabilizing protein in her final step and her final fold purification was not calculated but chien had achieved less than 50-fold purification prior to her final column
dr._chamberlin testified that a 100-fold increase in purity in a single step-which would still leave chien at less than half the purity of gelfand-was greater than any effect he had seen
promega did not challenge roches evidence that chiens preparation could not possibly have reached the purity_levels of the inventors
although the panel_majority disputes the statement that the example_vi purity is` more than an order of magnitude [ ten times ] higher than that claimed for the previously isolated taq_polymerase and at least an order of magnitude higher than that for e. coli polymerase' ¡¬818_patent col. 41 lines 17-20 the prior_art activities of 118.7 units/mg for the chien taq_polymerase and 7,658 units/mg for the kaledin taq_polymerase were conceded by promegas witnesses to be less than one tenth that of the product of example_vi however activity was calculated
and there was no challenge to the accuracy of the inventors statement comparing the activity of the example_vi taq_polymerase with that of e. coli polymerase

the district_court found that the examiner` did not indicate in any way that she considered the greater purity of the cetus enzyme to be a basis for patentability'
nonetheless the statement of` single_band_purity' of the product of example_vi is *1377 raised by the panel_majority as grounds of inequitable_conduct
the district_court found that prep 4` very nearly yielded a single_band' and referred to the evidence that` faint_bands' evident in these preparations are not contaminating proteins but are shorter forms of the taq_enzyme that are artifacts of the purification process
the evidence that these procedures achieved` essentially a pure protein' stands undisputed
also someone of skill in this art would understand the statement that the purified fractions were` nuclease free' to indicate that nuclease was not detected over background levels according to promegas expert dr._linn who explained that he instructs his graduate students to state nuclease_activity as` less than' a particular value to avoid the phrase` nuclease free'
i take note that nuclease_activity was not an issue during prosecution and that for these properties there was no evidence of material_misrepresentation with intent to deceive the examiner

b
constructive reduction to practice
example_vi is not really a` paper_example' as the term is normally used for example_vi is a combination of actual_experiments
however even if any example that was not performed precisely as written were deemed to be a` paper_example' such_examples have long been accepted in patent_documents unlike their prohibition in scientific_articles
paper_examples meet the practical need of compliance with the requirement for specific_embodiments of every invention as well as with aspects of patent_law such as the need to provide a full range of variables or to describe and enable alternatives or equivalents
to fulfill their legal purpose such_examples must be enabling of specific_embodiments
for some inventions the detailed embodiments can be described and enabled by the inventor without conducting full laboratory experiments or building entire machines
the patent_law authorizes that an invention may be constructively reduced to practice by filing a patent_application whether the embodiments were actually made or are constructed in the patent_application

`` constructive reduction to practice' is a legal_status unique to the patent art
unlike the rules for scientific_publications which require actual performance of every experimental detail patent_law and practice are directed to teaching the invention so that it can be practiced
the inclusion of constructed examples in a patent_application is an established method of providing the technical content needed to support the conceived scope of the invention
the manual of patent_examining_procedure implements this legal_status and purpose in its explicit recognition that` simulated or predicted test_results and prophetic_examples paper_examples are permitted'
mpep_¡± 608.01 p
although the mpep states that the present_tense should be used for such_examples see n. 2 supra patentability does not depend on whether the example was actually conducted
the presentation of accurate` constructive' descriptive and enabling information in the specification whether or not marked as` prophetic' is not material_misrepresentation with culpable intent
indeed were there negligence on the part of the inventors in presenting most of example_vi in the past_tense it is established law that negligence alone even gross negligence does not establish inequitable_conduct
kingsdown 863 f.2d at 876 9 uspq2d at 1392

it is not scientifically improper to gather knowledge from separate experiments and to draw scientific conclusions based thereon ; that is the methodology of science
it is not a legal misrepresentation to fuse knowledge from various sources drawing *1378 on ones skill and experience
although dr._mosbaugh testified that` as an enzymologist i can not fuse these [ prep 3 and prep 4 ] together and get any prediction as to what the outcome would be' these inventors did fuse them and did predict the outcome
it is not inequitable_conduct to have superior knowledge and experience and to use them to successfully predict the scientific result
precedent recognizes that whether an example was performed precisely as written does not establish materiality or deceptive_intent
in regents v. eli_lilly the court considered specific examples written in the past_tense that differed from the experiments actually performed but found no inequitable_conduct despite the applicants modification of the experimental_details
119 f.3d at 1570 43 uspq2d at 1407` there is no reason to believe that a reasonable_examiner would have made any different decision if uc had framed examples 4_and_5 as constructive examples'
in atlas_powder_co. v. e.i
du_pont_de_nemours & co. 750_f.2d_1569 1578 224_uspq_409 415 fed.cir.1984 the entire text of the patent is in the present_tense including all examples the court holding that when` all but one of the examples were based on actual_experiments and only slightly modified to reflect the inventors notion of the most effective formulation' the inventors` failing to tell the examiner that the examples wereprophetic` is not inequitable_conduct
the district_court agreed that the properties of the taq_polymerase described in example_vi were not significantly different from the properties of the products of prep 3 or prep 4
there was no evidence that the examiner might have decided differently as to patentability had the examiner known the origin of example_vi

even were example_vi deemed not to be in impeccable compliance with the protocol of the manual of patent_examining_procedure this is not material_misrepresentation and deceptive_intent
inventors gelfand and stoffel were interrogated at length concerning their use of verb tense
they testified that they were not aware of the protocol of using the present_tense in patent_examples and that example_vi was provided to comply with the best_mode_requirement
the panel_majority misconstrues this testimony dr._gelfand did not state that he knew of and thus deliberately violated the patent protocol of past and present_tense as he distinguished scientific writing from the` arcaneness' of patent_documents
dr._gelfand was persistently asked over many pages of the trial transcript whether he understood the significance of verb tense in scientific_publications as promega attempted to impugn the scientific integrity of the inventors
the following exchanges are typical mr._troupis promegas attorney so when you used the term` was' or` were' you understood did you not that that communicates that you had done it ?
you understood that ; did you not dr._gelfand ?
dr._gelfand were coming to an area that deals with prophetic_examples and arcaneness and i- mr._troupis im not coming to anything with regard to the law
im coming to the facts dr._gelfand
im simply asking you when you used those terms` was'` were' or the like you mean you actually did it ; do n't you ?
when you used those terms as a scientist thats what you mean you did it ?
dr._gelfand we did many many of the things described
the` was' is absolutely correct..

* * * mr._troupis i want this record to be clear
no one did example_vi before june of 1987-thats a` yes' or` no' question dr._gelfand-is n't that right ?
*1379 dr._gelfand i believe thats correct
mr._troupis yet you put in the patent that you or somebody had done it ; is n't that right ?
dr._gelfand we put in the patent in the description in example_vi what i believed to be the best_way to go about isolating taq dna_polymerase at the time
mr._troupis you used the tense the past_tense in example_vi indicating you had done it and in a scientific_publication that means you did it it does n't mean you hoped for it it means you did it ; does n't it dr._gelfand ?
dr._gelfand in a scientific_publication yes
* * * mr._troupis you chose at that time not to tell the patent office what you had done but chose to tell them something you had not done ?
you just indicated you made a conscious decision to tell them something you had not done and tell them in a way as if it had been done ; is n't that right ?
dr._gelfand no
it was my understanding that we had an obligation to tell the patent_office what we believed to be the best_way of [ purifying taq ] drawing on the experience from the third prep drawing on the experience from the fourth prep and describing for the patent_office for the world the best_way we thought to go about doing it
thats what i believed
ms._stoffel was similarly interrogated
the panel_majority now faults the inventors for not explaining why a different_principle applies in patent_applications than in scientific_articles
indeed the differences between scientific and patent practice are commonly misunderstood
however the patent use of constructed examples is not a material_misrepresentation whether or not the examples are designated as constructed ; and the provision of accurate science in the wrong verb tense does not establish deceptive_intent
such findings which require the elements of common law fraud are measured by objective reasonableness
telling the truth even in the past_tense can not be a material_misrepresentation or clear and convincing_evidence of deceptive_intent

iii
fidelity and activity
the panel_majority also finds grounds of inequitable_conduct because the inventors in comparing their taq_polymerase with the chien and kaledin published properties of the prior_art taq did not repeat the prior_art procedures
indeed it is facile to ascertain what experiments were not done and then to argue that they should have been done on risk of invalidating the patent for inequitable_conduct
my colleagues hold that the inventors should not have stated that their products were superior in activity and in fidelity to the products reported in the publications of chien and kaledin because the inventors should not have relied on the data in those publications without duplicating them
the publications of chien and kaledin included the specific activities of their products as well as the molecular_weights and the methods of measurement
there was no evidence that these data were incorrect ; the only charge was that the prior_art could not` legitimately' be compared

there was no evidence that the published assays of chien and kaledin were incorrect for their products or should have been suspected to be materially different from the published values
indeed the evidence was undisputed that the chien and kaledin products were degraded as gelfand and stoffel discovered and that the properties reported for this early work were for degraded products
there was *1380 no evidence that the improvements in assay_conditions over the ensuing decade would have altered the dramatic difference between the activities of 118.7 units/mg and 7,658 units/mg reported by chien and kaledin respectively and the activities found by gelfand and stoffel for their undegraded enzyme
indeed the examiner did not question the inventors comparisons of activity with the prior_art although the examiner did question the molecular_weight comparisons
while promega places emphasis on the evolution of precision in measurement of taq_polymerase activity and on an apparent uncertainty in ms._stoffels recollection at trial of the details of assay procedures used at various times it is not disputed that the magnitude of the claimed differences in activity was correct.4 no information is asserted to have been withheld from the examiner
the findings of materiality and deceptive_intent in the comparison of activity are devoid of any support

similarly the panel_majority challenges the comparisons of fidelity and template_dependency
the only_evidence on this issue was the testimony of promegas expert dr._kunkel
he testified that it was scientifically unacceptable for dr._gelfand to have compared his results with the prior_art
dr._kunkel stated that` [ the results ] do n't lead me and i do n't think they would lead any correct-thinking scientist to conclude that those results can be fairly compared to what was done with activated dna
it simply is not a scientifically valid comparison to make'
dr._kunkel testified that` it is certainly not a scientifically-valid statement to say that based on this information that the patented enzyme was far superior to the prior_art in this regard..
its simply not correct scientific principles'
he compared the statements in the patent concerning fidelity to` scientific misconduct' and designated them as` intentional misrepresentations'
he stated that the inventors should have duplicated the prior_art in order to conduct a side-by-side comparison
the district_court asked the court in your view is dr._gelfand a fraud ?
dr._kunkel yes
in-on the issues related to this case yes.. and he knew better
thus the witness challenged the inventors integrity and competence although it was undisputed that their conclusions were correct.5 my colleagues adopt these specious charges of scientific_fraud although neither inaccuracy nor falsity of any data was shown
it is not a material_misrepresentation with intent to deceive for an inventor to use his/her knowledge and experience to reach a reasonable conclusion

the panel_majority appears to misunderstand the statements in the specification and during prosecution
the patent states that the inventors results` are consistent with' a high_fidelity polymerase and that the activity reported by kaledin` is not consistent with the expected value and suggests misincorporation of nucleotide *1381 triphosphate s'
the inventors explained to the examiner that chien and kaledins data` would lead one of ordinary_skill in the art to conclude that' the prior products` are not suitable for template-directed in vitro dna_synthesis' and` have a rather substantial_promiscuous_ability to synthesize dna in the absence of one of the four deoxynucleoside triphosphate'
response march_17,_1989
it is undisputed that the inventors data were accurately presented
dr._kunkels charge that dr._gelfand` knew better' is mysterious indeed when despite this inflammatory testimony the district_court found as fact that` evidence adduced by the inventors led them to believe that the prior_art had generated something other than that which the inventors purified'
no error has been asserted in this finding
a hostile_witness flashy challenge to the inventors personal integrity is not probative of anything

iv
the new plague
of course patent applicants must conduct themselves with honesty and integrity
however unwarranted charges of inequitable_conduct can infect the entire body of invention and inventors
as illustrated in this case every experiment done and not done every scientific inference every judgment or belief is fair game for opportunistic attack
such attacks feed upon the complexities of science and technology and it is rare indeed that some flaw can not be found
in this case straightforward scientific and patent activity were distorted until judicial suspicions were raised despite the absence of any significant error or misstatement
the actions challenged herein even if viewed in their worst light whatever that might be do not establish material_misrepresentation and intent to deceive
the need for attention to the burden of proof and its requirement of clear and convincing_evidence of both material_misrepresentation and deceptive_intent is forcefully illustrated

regents of the university of california v. eli_lilly & co. 119_f.3d_1559 43_uspq2d_1398 fed.cir.1997 relied on by the dissent is inapposite because the misidentification of a plasmid in the patent_examples did not make the examples inoperative ; rather the procedures described in the examples` worked to yield the intended results irrespective of' whether the actual plasmid was used making the` misidentification of the plasmid.. not material to patentability'

in this case not only did the applicants fail to practice the example as written but they also failed to achieve the stated results
the dissents reliance on atlas_powder_co. v. e.i
du_pont_de_nemours & co. 750_f.2d_1569 224_uspq_409 fed.cir.1984 is also misplaced
in that case the examples were written in the present_tense to conform with the pto requirements on prophetic_examples and the appellants claim was that the patentee should have informed the patent_examiner that the examples written in the present_tense were prophetic
we held that it was not clear_error for the district_court to find no materiality or intent to deceive under those circumstances
not only were those facts-use of the present_tense when it was proper to do so-wholly different from the facts of this case but in atlas powder we applied the` clearly erroneous' standard of review to uphold the district_courts findings as opposed to rejecting the district_courts findings as the dissent would have us do here

under the current_standard for materiality there would be no question that the inventors representations would be material

although the current_standard was not in effect at the time of the prosecution of this patent the new standard was not intended to constitute a significant substantive break with the previous standard

roche contends that the language at issue is merely a statement of belief which can not constitute a material_misrepresentation
we disagree
the applicants did not in any way indicate that they were simply conveying their personal beliefs ; instead the language used by the applicants indicated that they were offering the representations as statements of fact

we do not suggest that an applicant is required to repeat the experiments of the prior_art ; an applicant however may not knowingly misrepresent those experiments or their results

roches expert_witness dr._chamberlin was comparing prep 4 to example_vi when the district_court cut off the testimony the court this whole line of questioning youve shown the consistency between the notebooks and whats on the flowchart and whats on the flowchart and the patent
and so whats the point youre making ?
roche_attorney that this fourth purification scheme in fact leads to a preparation that meets the purity_levels that were already to the patent_office
the court and i ask you again what is the significance of that ?
roche_attorney that the inventors had in fact performed a purification run where they obtained preparations of significantly high purity that they could make the arguments that they made to the patent_office your honor
the court all right
well i think youve made your point without belaboring it

the district_court re-calculated the specific_activity data to accord with the definition of` unit' in example_vi
the chien and kaledin publications both define` unit' in accordance with the inventors raw data supporting the inventors activity number of 250,000 units/mg
by any of the calculation methods presented at trial whether that of cetus promega or the district_court there was at least a ten-fold improvement of unit activity as described in the patent in suit
