i
since about 1970 chance has manufactured screw_anchors also called helical piers for use in supporting and stabilizing electrical transmission towers
screw anchors are elongated shafts with an earth-boring screw tip and a transversely extending load-bearing member
in 1988 chance extended its expertise in stabilizing slumping structures into the residential and commercial building markets
chance used screw_anchors with a metal_bracket to underpin these building_foundations
the chance underpinning method places the screw_anchor adjacent to the footing and rotates the screw_anchor to bore beneath the footing
when resistance to rotation of the screw_anchor reaches a specified point chance attaches a metal_bracket designated as 30 in the figure below to the slouching foundation to transfer the building load onto the screw_anchor
the united states patent and trademark office issued u.s. patent nos._5139 368_and_5171,107 to chance in 1992 covering this screw_anchor system
figure 5 in the ¡¬107_patent shows the technology

?
appellees richard ruiz and his company foundation anchoring systems inc. collectively` ruiz' became distributors for chances underpinning_system
during the early 1990s ruiz also formed various other anchoring companies and marketed systems that competed with the chance system
in february 1997 chance terminated ruizs distributorship
thereafter ruiz began marketing an underpinning *1273 system with screw_anchors and metal_brackets
this new system used components from other manufacturers
ruiz filed suit against chance in august of that same year alleging various non-patent_claims including discrimination breach of contract tortious interference with contract and business relations and breach of fiduciary duty of good faith and fair dealing
ruiz also filed for a declaratory judgment that its new underpinning_system does not infringe chances patents and that the patents are invalid
chance filed a counterclaim for patent infringement

the validity question focuses on several prior_art_references
during the late 1980s richard fuller and stan rupiper used screw_anchors for underpinning existing structural_foundations
fuller and rupiper used a concrete_haunch not a metal_bracket to transfer the load of the foundation to the screw_anchor the` fuller-rupiper_method'
gregorys u.s. patent nos._4911 580_and_4765,777 claim an apparatus and system for underpinning structural_foundations using a push_pier and a metal_bracket
in the gregory_system the metal_bracket transfers the foundation load to the push_pier which is driven into the ground to supply the necessary foundational support
the push_pier relies on soil friction to supply that support
figure 6 of the ¡¬580_patent shows this technology

?
the scope of the claims in this case is not at issue in this appeal because the parties agree that the claims are infringed or invalidated by the use of a screw_anchor in conjunction with a metal_bracket to underpin a foundation
additional information *1274 concerning the claims and the other aspects of this case appear in this courts opinion in ruiz v. a.b
chance_co. 234_f.3d_654 fed.cir.2000
examination of the prior_art shows that the fuller-rupiper_method discloses the screw_anchor component of the claims ; the gregory_system discloses the metal_bracket component in the claims
thus this appeal is properly focused on the motivation to combine those teachings as well as any secondary_considerations that might inform the obviousness_analysis

the district_court granted summary judgment in favor of chance on all of ruizs non-patent_claims in april 1999
on the patent_claims the district_court held a markman hearing to construe the claims and a bench_trial to decide the issues of infringement and validity
at the time of trial the scope of the case had narrowed to focus on claims 1-big_token__4_and_6__big_token -8 of the ¡¬368_patent and claims 1-big_token__4_and_6__big_token -8 of the ¡¬107_patent
after the trial the district_court entered its judgment from the bench that ruizs product infringes the patent_claims to the tune of $ 540,000 in damages
nonetheless the trial_court determined that the claims are invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 in light of the gregory_patents and the fuller-rupiper_method

this court heard the appeal from that judgment and affirmed every holding of the district_court except the finding of obviousness
in ruiz 234 f.3d at 660 this court remanded the case to the district_court for further examination of obviousness
this court issued the following instructions on remand we instruct the district_court to make specific graham findings on 1 the reason suggestion or motivation present in the prior_art in the knowledge of one of skill in the art or in the problem of foundation settling which clearly and particularly would lead one of ordinary_skill in the art to combine screw_anchors with metal_brackets ; 2 the level of ordinary_skill in the art ; and 3 whether and to what extent evidence of secondary consideration such as commercial_success long felt but unresolved need failure of others copying and unexpected results is probative in the obviousness_analysis
id

the district_court invited additional briefing and oral argument on the remand issues
having reconsidered the evidence of the case the district_court again found the relevant claims invalid as obvious and issued an opinion outlining its factual_findings according to this courts instructions
of particular significance the district_court found the motivation to combine the teachings of the gregory_patents and the fuller-rupiper_method in the nature of the problem of underpinning foundations itself explaining the rupiper_method and the gregory_patent can be combined in either of two ways to reach the same result as the method covered by the patents in issue here by replacing the concrete_haunch of the rupiper_method with the bracket of the gregory_patent or by replacing the straight piling of the gregory_patent with the screw_anchor of the rupiper_method
the evidence in this case showed that there was reason suggestion or motivation to make these combinations..
the problem is the same how to underpin an unstable foundation of an existing building

the district_court also discounted chances proffered objective evidence of commercial_success and skepticism of experts as weak
specifically the district_court found that the alleged skepticism of chances system by rupiper was merely an acknowledgement that rupipers concrete_haunch worked better than a metal_bracket in seismic areas such as california
*1275 the record indeed does not show that rupiper doubted that chances system would work in general
in addition the district_court attributed chances commercial_success to its background and experience in screw_anchors rather than any inventive features of the screw_anchor-metal_bracket system as a whole

chance now appeals again arguing that the district_court as it did in its original judgment employed hindsight to find obviousness
specifically this appeal involves two challenges to the district_courts obviousness_determination 1 whether the district_court clearly erred in finding an implied motivation to combine the prior_art_teachings in the nature of the problem of underpinning existing foundations and 2 whether the district_court clearly erred in discounting chances evidence of secondary_considerations
jurisdiction over this appeal is proper under 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295

ii
section 103 of title 35 of the united states code states a patent may not be obtained.. if the differences between the subject_matter sought to be patented and the prior_art are such that the subject_matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary_skill in the art to which said subject_matter pertains
35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a 2000

in making the assessment of differences section 103 specifically requires consideration of the claimed invention` as a whole'
inventions typically are new_combinations of existing principles or features
envtl designs ltd. v. union oil co. 713_f.2d_693 698 fed.cir.1983 noting that` virtually all [ inventions ] are combinations of old elements`
the` as a whole' instruction in title 35 prevents evaluation of the invention part by part
without this important requirement an obviousness assessment might break an invention into its component parts a + b + c then find a prior_art reference containing a another containing b and another containing c and on that basis alone declare the invention obvious
this form of hindsight reasoning using the invention as a roadmap to find its prior_art components would discount the value of combining various existing features or principles in a new way to achieve a new result-often the very definition of invention

section 103 precludes this hindsight discounting of the value of new_combinations by requiring assessment of the invention as a whole
this court has provided further assurance of an` as a whole' assessment of the invention under ¡± 103 by requiring a showing that an artisan of ordinary_skill in the art at the time of invention confronted by the same problems as the inventor and with no knowledge of the claimed invention would select the various elements from the prior_art and combine them in the claimed manner
in other words the examiner or court must show some suggestion or motivation before the invention itself to make the new combination
see in re rouffet 149_f.3d_1350 1355-56 fed.cir.1998

while the ultimate determination of obviousness is a legal conclusion reviewed by this court without deference that determination always entails various factual_findings that this court reviews for clear_error following a bench_trial
see weatherchem corp. v. j.l
clark inc. 163_f.3d_1326 1332 fed.cir.1998
the clear_error standard permits reversal only when this court is left with a` definite and firm_conviction' that the district_court was in error
amhil enters ltd. v. wawa inc. 81_f.3d_1554 1562 fed.cir.1996

*1276 this case deals with a challenge to the district_courts conclusion on two of the underlying factual determinations in its obviousness_analysis
accordingly this court will review for clear_error the district_courts conclusions regarding objective secondary_considerations see pro-mold v. great lakes plastics 75_f.3d_1568 1572 fed.cir.1996 and whether a motivation to combine the teachings in the prior_art_references was shown see winner int l royalty corp. v. wang 202_f.3d_1340 1348 fed.cir.2000

the district_court in this case presided over a bench_trial and reconsidered the evidence on remand
chances principal argument is that the district_court clearly erred in finding a motivation to combine the teachings in the gregory_patents with the fuller-rupiper_method
chance cites this courts precedent that warns district_courts about the risk of hindsight reconstruction to find an invention obvious where the invention at issue involves relatively simple technology
see mcginley v. franklin sports inc. 262_f.3d_1339 1351 fed.cir.2001
accordingly chance argues that the district_court utilized hindsight to find that a person of ordinary_skill would have been motivated to combine the prior_art_teachings

to the contrary the record in this case supports the trial_courts findings
while this court indeed warns against employing hindsight its counsel is just that-a warning
that warning does not provide a rule of law that an express written motivation to combine must appear in prior_art_references before a finding of obviousness
stated differently this court has consistently stated that a court or examiner may find a motivation to combine prior_art_references in the nature of the problem to be solved
see pro-mold 75 f.3d at 1573 ; display techs. inc. v. paul flum ideas inc. 60_fed.appx._787_(fed.cir.2002) ; in re huang 100_f.3d_135 139_n._5_(fed.cir.1996)
this form of motivation to combine evidence is particularly relevant with simpler mechanical technologies

this record shows that the district_court did not use hindsight in its obviousness_analysis but properly found a motivation to combine because the two references address precisely the same problem of underpinning existing structural_foundations
moreover the record supports the district_courts factual_finding that fullers and rupipers work showed that screw_anchors worked better than straight push_piers
in fact the evidence shows that rupiper introduced chance to the use of screw_anchors in underpinning building_foundations
chance then added a metal_bracket to the screw_anchor

the record also supports the district_courts conclusion that artisans knew that a foundation underpinning_system requires a means of connecting the foundation to the load-bearing member
the gregory_patents teach the use of a metal_bracket to connect a foundation to a straight pier and testimony at trial showed that the need for a connecting element was widely known
thus the district_court could properly conclude on this record without being clearly in error that a person of ordinary_skill would be led to combine the screw_anchor in the fuller-rupiper_method with the metal_bracket in the gregory_system to underpin an existing building foundation

this record it is true does not feature an express written teaching in the art to make this combination
on this record however that is not fatal to the district_courts obviousness_determination
as noted earlier this court has repeatedly stated that the motivation to combine the teachings in the prior_art may` come from *1277 the nature of a problem to be solved leading inventors to look to references relating to possible solutions to that problem'
pro-mold 75 f.3d at 1573
the district_court in this case applied that settled law
the district_court sitting as a finder of fact weighed the evidence and found that because the prior_art_references address the narrow problem of underpinning existing building_foundations a person seeking to solve that exact same problem would consult the references and apply their teachings together
thus the district_courts conclusion is perfectly legitimate when the evidence supports it as it does here

chances argument amounts to little more than its own alternative view of the evidence
while the record does contain some evidence against the district_courts finding such evidence is not overwhelming by any means
in addition the district_court in this case did not simply discount all contrary evidence and bolster a meager amount of evidence to reach a preformed conclusion
in fact the district_court discounted and discredited some testimony that actually supported its ultimate conclusion
for instance the trial_court dismissed the testimony of robert jones a chance distributor that he would have made the combination
the district_court declined to credit mr._jones testimony because he exhibited far more than an ordinary level of skill in this art
the trial_courts careful consideration of mr._jones evidence shows further that it performed a detailed and reasoned analysis of the evidence rather than a conclusion-oriented discussion that typically accompanies a hindsight analysis
in short the record in this case does not approach the evidence necessary to leave this court with a firm_conviction that the district_court committed clear_error in its factual_finding of a motivation to combine the fuller-rupiper and gregory teachings

finally the record also supports the district_courts discounting of chances evidence of secondary_considerations
the record supports the trial_courts finding that any commercial_success was not due to chances alleged unique combination but rather due to chances experience with screw_anchors combined with being the first large screw_anchor manufacturer to enter the underpinning market
the district_court did not clearly err in reaching this conclusion nor in concluding that the evidence of skepticism was weak

iii
based on the above analysis this court holds that the district_court did not clearly err in finding a motivation to combine the prior_art_references in the nature of the problem at issue
in addition this court holds that the district_court did not clearly err in discounting chances evidence of secondary_considerations
accordingly this court affirms the judgment of the district_court
