k-2 corporation appeals the summary_judgment of noninfringement granted in favor of salomon_s.a. and salomon/north_america inc. by the united_states_district_court for the western_district of washington
see k-2_corp. v. salomon_s.a. 1998_wl_1032110 50_uspq2d_1054_(w.d.wash.1998)
the district_court after construing the disputed claim_terms in k-2s reexamined united_states patent no._5437,466 determined that no reasonable jury could find that the accused product-salomons model` tr' in-line skate-infringed the asserted patent either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents
see id.at 1057
because we conclude that the district_court correctly interpreted the relevant claim_language and properly determined that the doctrine of equivalents could not be used to reach the accused device we affirm

i
a. k-2 corporation` k-2' is the owner of reexamined u.s. patent no._5437,466` the466_patent` issued august 1 1995 entitled` in-line roller skate'
the466_patent is generally directed to an in-line skate that has a soft pliable inner` bootie' or` shoe' surrounded in certain areas by molded plastic or straps affixed to the base of the skate
this arrangement allows the wearers foot to breathe and offers a substantially lighter skate while retaining structural stiffness required for performance

*1360. ?
figure 1466_patent
claims 1 5 and 6 of the466_patent are the only claims at issue in this case
representative claim 1 recites five major claimed components as set forth in brief form below with the key_limitation underlined 1
in an in-line_roller skate having an upper shoe portion and a lower_frame_portion.. a non-rigid shoe portion adapted to receive and substantially enclose the entire foot of the skater.. support means positioned adjacent selected areas of said non-rigid shoe portion for providing support to aid the skater in maintaining said in-line_roller skate in a substantially vertical position.. and a base_portion.. said non-rigid shoe portion being permanently affixed to said base_portion at least at said toe_area and said heel_area for substantially preventing movement_therebetween at least in a horizontal_plane wherein at least a portion of said non-rigid shoe portion extends continuously from said base_portion to at least the top of said ankle support cuff

claims 5_and_6 contain what the parties agree is equivalent language with respect to the key_limitation 5
... said non-rigid shoe portion being permanently interconnected with said base_portion at least at said toe_area and said heel_area for substantially *1361 preventing movement_therebetween at least in a horizontal_plane.. 6
... said non- [ rigid ] upper portion being non-removably affixed to said rigid base adjacent both said heel and toe portions of said base for substantially preventing movement_therebetween at least in a horizontal_plane..

salomon_s.a. and salomon north_america collectively` salomon' make and sell an in-line skate designated as model tr that includes a soft inner bootie surrounded by a rigid plastic structure` the tr skate'
the tr skates inner bootie is fastened to the lower rigid portion of the skate by the use of rivets and a screw in the toe_area and by a removable hex-head screw in the heel_area
the parties agree that the dispositive issue in this case is whether the use of a removable_screw in the heel_area of the tr skate can meet the` permanently affixed' limitation found in claims 1 5 and 6 of the466_patent

b
in april 1998 k-2 sued salomon for infringement of the466_patent
on cross-motions for summary_judgment the district_court rejected k-2s arguments that the disputed` permanently affixed' claim_limitation should be construed to be synonymous with` affixed'` secured' or` firmly held' and instead held that the ordinary_meaning of` permanently affixed' could not encompass the removable_screw used in the heel_area of the tr skate
see k-2_corp. v. salomon_s.a. 1998_wl_1032110 50_uspq2d_1054 1056 w.d.wash.1998
the court determined that because the tr skate was missing an element of the466_patent_claims it could not as a matter of law literally infringe those claims
see id

*1362 the district_court also held that the tr skate could not as a matter of law infringe under the doctrine of equivalents because of prosecution_history_estoppel
see id.at 1057
the court concluded that in amending the relevant claims during prosecution and examination to add the` permanently affixed' limitation and the heel and toe locations of the fastening k-2 had relinquished coverage of in-line_skates that did not have a bootie permanently affixed at both the heel and the toe
see id
the court further noted that the relevant prosecution_history suggested that k-2 amended the claim to avoid a prior_art reference u.s. patent no._5331,752 to johnson` the johnson_reference' that discloses an in-line skate in which the bootie is removable and affixed at the toe and mid-foot
see id
the district_court concluded that k-2s relinquishment of such_subject_matter prevented it from now asserting that the heel_screw of salomons tr skate was equivalent to the` permanently affixed' limitation of the466 claims
summary judgment of noninfringement was granted in favor of salomon
see id

k-2 appeals that decision vesting this court with jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1 1994

ii
we review the grant of summary_judgment de novo
see conroy v. reebok_int l ltd. 14_f.3d_1570 1575 29_uspq2d_1373 1377 fed.cir.1994
in doing so we must keep in mind that summary_judgment is appropriate only if there is no genuine_issue of material_fact
see fed.r.civ.p
56 c
to this end the court must draw all reasonable factual inferences in favor of the nonmovant
see anderson v. liberty_lobby inc. 477_u.s._242 255 106_s.ct._2505 91_l.ed.2d_202_(1986)

an infringement analysis is a two-step process in which the court first determines as a matter of law the correct claim scope and then compares the properly construed claim to the accused device to determine as a matter of fact whether all of the claim_limitations are present in the accused device either literally or by a substantial equivalent
see renishaw plc v. marposs societa per azioni 158_f.3d_1243 1247-48 48_uspq2d_1117 1120 fed.cir.1998 ; general mills inc. v. hunt-wesson inc. 103_f.3d_978 981 41_uspq2d_1440 1442 fed.cir.1997 ; young dental mfg co. v. q3 special prods. inc. 112_f.3d_1137 1141 42_uspq2d_1589 1592 fed.cir.1997
see also cybor corp. v. fas_technologies inc. 138_f.3d_1448 1454 46_uspq2d_1169 1172-73 fed.cir.1998 en banc

because the relevant aspects of the accused devices structure and operation are undisputed in this case the question of whether salomons tr skate literally infringes the asserted claims of the466_patent turns on the interpretation of those claims
see athletic alternatives inc. v. prince mfg. inc. 73_f.3d_1573 1578 37_uspq2d_1365 1370 fed.cir.1996` where as here the parties do not dispute any relevant facts regarding the accused product but disagree over [ claim_interpretation ] the question of literal_infringement collapses to one of claim_construction and is thus amenable to summary_judgment
``

we begin of course with the language of the claims
see renishaw 158 f.3d at 1248 48 uspq2d at 1120 ; abtox inc. v. exitron corp. 122_f.3d_1019 1023 43_uspq2d_1545 1548 fed.cir.1997 ; bell communications research inc. v. vitalink communications corp. 55_f.3d_615 619-20 34_uspq2d_1816 1819 fed.cir.1995
the general rule is that terms in the claim are to be given their ordinary and accustomed_meaning
see johnson_worldwide assoc. inc. v. zebco corp. 175_f.3d_985 989 50_uspq2d_1607 1610 fed.cir.1999 ; renishaw 158 f.3d at 1249 48 uspq2d at 1121 ; york prods. inc. v. central tractor farm & family ctr. 99_f.3d_1568 1572 40_uspq2d_1619 1622 fed.cir.1996
that is the ordinary and accustomed_meaning of a disputed claim_term *1363 is presumed to be the correct one see johnson_worldwide 175 f.3d at 989 50 uspq2d at 1610 subject to the following
first a different meaning clearly and deliberately set forth in the intrinsic materials-the written description or the prosecution_history-will control
see id
; in re paulsen 30_f.3d_1475 1480 31_uspq2d_1671 1674 fed.cir.1994 ; intellicall inc. v. phonometrics inc. 952_f.2d_1384 1387-88 21_uspq2d_1383 1386 fed.cir.1992 ; lear siegler inc. v. aeroquip corp. 733_f.2d_881 888-89 221_uspq_1025_(fed.cir.1984)
second if the ordinary and accustomed_meaning of a disputed term would deprive the claim of clarity then further reference must be made to the intrinsic-or in some cases extrinsic-evidence to ascertain the proper meaning
see johnson_worldwide 175 f.3d at 990 50 uspq2d at 1610-11
in either case a party wishing to alter the meaning of a clear_claim_term must overcome the presumption that the ordinary and accustomed_meaning is the proper one demonstrating why such an alteration is required
see johnson_worldwide 175 f.3d at 989-90 50 uspq2d at 1610

here the critical claim_language is` permanently affixed'
the parties agree that the relevant_language in claims 5_and_6 is equivalent and there is no dispute about the meaning of` affixed' in this context
thus our analysis begins with the ordinary and accustomed_meaning of the term` permanently' in the phrase` permanently affixed'
the ordinary and accustomed_meaning of this phrase as the district_court noted see k-2 50 uspq2d at 1056 does not encompass affixation via removable_screw
that is the ordinary and accustomed_meaning of` permanently affixed' in this context requires that the fastening be unremovable

k-2s primary argument is that the functional_language in the claim following this limitation-' for substantially preventing movement_therebetween at least in a horizontal_plane' -dictates the meaning of` permanently affixed'
that is k-2 suggests that the inclusion of this functional_language converts the meaning of` permanently affixed' to mean` affixed to prevent movement in at least a horizontal_plane'
we can not accept this reading of the claim
the functional_language is of course an additional limitation in the claim
see e.g. wright medical technology inc. v. osteonics corp. 122_f.3d_1440 1443-44 43_uspq2d_1837 1840 fed.cir.1997 functional_language analyzed as a claim_limitation
this limitation requires that the attachment between the bootie and the base` substantially prevent [ ]' movement of the bootie and presumably the users foot when inserted in the bootie in a horizontal_plane
in other words the functional_language requires that the attachment prevent the bootie from sliding around on top of the base ; it demands a structural rigidity in the horizontal_dimension to the connection between the bootie and the base
it also as k-2 correctly notes may be accomplished with an attachment that is easily removable or at least something less than permanent
but it is undeniable that this language is fully consistent with a permanent attachment as well
that is the functional_language tells us something about the structural requirements of the attachment between the bootie and the base ; it speaks not at all however about whether that attachment is permanent something less than permanent or entirely removable
the only answer to that question of course is the specific claim_limitation that the bootie be` permanently affixed' to the base
k-2 reads the functional_language in a way that would effectively expunge the term` permanently' from the claim_language
cf perkin-elmer corp. v. westinghouse elec corp. 822_f.2d_1528 1533_n._8 3_uspq2d_1321 1325_n._8_(fed.cir.1987)` [ s ] pecific claim_limitations can [ not ] be ignored as insignificant or immaterial in determining infringement`
a more natural construction reads the two clauses as complementary recognizing that` permanently affixed' requires an unremovable attachment while the functional_language requires that the attachment prevent sliding
*1364 see e.g. renishaw 158 f.3d at 1250 48 uspq2d at 1122 fed.cir.1998` the construction that stays true to the claim_language and most naturally aligns with the patents description of the invention will be in the end the correct construction
``

while the claim itself provides no reason to alter the ordinary and accustomed_meaning of` permanently affixed' k-2 may and does argue that the intrinsic evidence clearly sets forth an alternate definition
see beachcombers v. wildewood creative products inc. 31_f.3d_1154 1158 31_uspq2d_1653 1656 fed.cir.1994` as we have repeatedly said a patentee can be his own_lexicographer provided the patentees definition to the extent it differs from the conventional definition is clearly set forth in the specification
`` ; hoganas ab v. dresser industries inc. 9_f.3d_948 951 28_uspq2d_1936 1938 fed.cir.1993` although a patentee can be his own_lexicographer as we have repeatedly said the words of a claim will be given their ordinary_meaning unless it appears that the inventor used them differently' internal quotations omitted
in particular k-2 points to amendments and arguments made in support of patentability over the prior_art_johnson skate
there the applicant stated that the addition of the term` permanently' served to distinguish the claims from the` detachable' boot disclosed in johnson
the applicant further argued that an advantage of the permanent_connection was that it avoided the sliding heel the applicant noted as a problem with the prior_art
from these passages k-2 draws a conclusion similar to that outlined above that` permanently affixed' must mean simply` affixed to prevent sliding in a horizontal_dimension'
we reject this conclusion the proposed definition of` permanently' as` preventing sliding in a horizontal_dimension' does not appear with the required clarity deliberateness and precision to impart an unaccustomed_meaning to an otherwise clear_claim_term
see in re paulsen 30 f.3d at 1480 31 uspq2d at 1674` although an inventor is indeed free to define the specific terms used to describe his or her invention this must be done with reasonable clarity deliberateness and precision
`` ; hoganas 9 f.3d at 951 28 uspq2d at 1938-39 finding patentees proposed definition unsupported in the specification or prosecution_history
nowhere in the passages cited to us does the applicant squarely describe the nature of the connection i.e.` permanently affixed' in the pending claims
instead the relevant_language focuses on the connection in the prior_art_johnson skate` detachable' and the advantages provided by the` permanently affixed' connection
k-2 therefore asks that we infer that the distinctions the applicant draws between the` detachable' boot in the prior_art and the` permanently affixed' connection required by the claims constitute a clear explication of an unaccustomed definition of the term` permanently'
we decline however to adopt a proffered unaccustomed_meaning with so little support in the intrinsic record
see in re paulsen 30 f.3d at 1480 31 uspq2d at 1674` the specification merely describes in a general fashion certain features and capabilities desirable in a portable computer
this description however is far from establishing a specialized definition [ of computer ]
``

to be sure the prosecution_history indicates that the applicant intended to amend the claims to avoid the` detachable' connection of the johnson skate
the same history however indicates that the applicant chose to add the term` permanently' to the claims in order to achieve this result
that the applicant could possibly have added terms other than` permanently' to create a patentable distinction with the asserted prior_art is simply irrelevant to our claim_construction task
courts do not rewrite claims ; instead we give effect to the terms chosen by the patentee
see e.g. texas instruments inc. v. international trade comm n 988_f.2d_1165 1171 26_uspq2d_1018 1023 fed.cir.1993` [ t ] o construe the claims *1365 in the manner suggested by ti would read an express limitation out of the claims
this we will not do because [ c ] ourts can neither broaden nor narrow claims to give the patentee something different than what he has set forth` quoting autogiro_co. of america v. united_states 181_ct.cl._55 384_f.2d_391 396 155_uspq_697 701 ct.cl.1967
here we hold that the district_court correctly construed` permanently' according to its ordinary and accustomed_meaning-that is the phrase` permanently affixed' requires that the connection between the bootie and the base of the skate be unremovable

k-2 argues that its proposed definition of` permanently affixed' -meaning` affixed to prevent sliding in a horizontal_plane' -is the ordinary and accustomed_meaning of the phrase and that in any event salomon has not presented evidence to support its contention that the ordinary and accustomed_meaning of the phrase is` unremovable'
we of course recognize that the` ordinary and accustomed' meaning of a claim_term will often be in dispute irrespective of the clarity of the terms used
see senmed inc. v. richard-allan med
indus. inc. 888_f.2d_815 819_n._8 12_uspq2d_1508 1512_n._8_(fed.cir.1989)` lawyers may create adispute about any word but there is nothing ambiguous or linguistically obscure about [ the disputed claim_term ] as used in the present claim`
but a dispute over the ordinary and accustomed_meaning does not imply that such a meaning does not exist
here for example we recognize that the term` permanently' has what can be said to be the flavor of infiniteness about its meaning which might raise questions about the use of the term in this claim even the most permanent of` permanently affixed' connections between the bootie and the base of the skate can after all be undone upon the total destruction of the skate itself
this however does not mean that because no connection between the bootie and skate can be` infinitely' permanent there can be no ordinary and accustomed_meaning for the claim_term
indeed we would be hard pressed to describe anything as` permanent' if that term is understood to require an infinite duration
but claim_construction is not philosophy ; we need not wring our hands when considering the implications of a metaphysical analysis of claim_terms
instead we need only recognize that claim_construction is firmly anchored in reality by the understanding of those of ordinary_skill in the art
see e.g. hoechst celanese corp. v. bp chemicals ltd. 78_f.3d_1575 1578 38_uspq2d_1126 1129 fed.cir.1996
in this case the parties and the district_court agree that the rivet and screw_attachment in the toe_area of the accused skate meet the` permanently affixed' claim_limitations
this is so because the rivet supplies the permanent unremovable_connection
indeed in the written description of the466_patent a rivet is cited as a conventional fastening means to accomplish a permanent_connection
see466 pat. col._8,_ll._55-58 describing connection between base and lower frame
the rivet-made permanent_connection is of course not` infinitely' permanent because the rivet can be broken
the same is true of an embodiment of the invention that achieved a permanent_connection between the base_portion and the lower_frame_portion of the skate by using a single injection molded unit
see id.at col._8,_ll._58-61
likewise were an adhesive laminate used to provide the permanent_connection see id.at col._13,_ll._48-55 that permanence too could be destroyed by breaking the structure apart
screws unlike rivets and laminates are meant to be unscrewed that is to be removed
a rivet or a laminate to the contrary is meant to remain permanent unremovable unless one is bent on breaking the permanent structure apart

here we are convinced that the district_court was correct in holding that the ordinary and accustomed_meaning of` permanently affixed' requires an unremovable_connection between the bootie and the base

because we agree with the district_courts construction of permanently affixed *1366 and the parties do not dispute that salomons accused device utilizes a removable_screw to connect the heel of the bootie to the skates base,1 we conclude that the district_court was correct in granting summary_judgment of no literal_infringement in favor of salomon
[ t ] he plain language of rule 56 c mandates the entry of summary_judgment after adequate time for discovery and upon motions against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that partys case and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial

iii
although salomons accused device can not -as a matter of law-literally infringe we must still determine whether the doctrine of equivalents may nonetheless allow k-2 to raise genuine_issues of material_fact regarding infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
see anderson v. liberty_lobby 477_u.s._242 255 106_s.ct._2505 91_l.ed.2d_202_(1986)
the doctrine of equivalents allows infringement to be found in some cases where the elements of the accused device are substantially equivalent to the corresponding elements of the asserted claim
see warner-jenkinson co. v. hilton davis chemical co. 520_u.s._17 29 117_s.ct._1040 137_l.ed.2d_146 41_uspq2d_1865 1869 1997
infringement under the doctrine of equivalents is a question of fact
see graver_tank & mfg co. v. linde air products co. 339_u.s._605 609-10 70_s.ct._854 94_l.ed._1097 85_uspq_328 331 1950

a
although the supreme_court in warner-jenkinson reaffirmed the existence of the doctrine of equivalents it did so with` concern.. that the doctrine of equivalents.. has taken on a life of its own unbounded by the patent_claims'
520 u.s. at 28-29 117_s.ct._1040 41 uspq2d at 1871
indeed while unquestionably retaining vitality the doctrine of equivalents exists in some tension with other core tenets of the patent_law perhaps most notably the requirement that the patentee` particularly point [ ] out and distinctly claim [ ] the subject_matter which the applicant regards as his invention' 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
2 1994 and the function of patent_claims to provide notice to competitors regarding the scope of the patent grant see united carbon co. v. binney & smith co. 317_u.s._228 232 63_s.ct._165 87_l.ed._232 55_uspq_381 383-84 1942` the inventor must inform the public.. of the limits of the monopoly asserted so that it may be known which features may be safely used or manufactured without a license and which may not' internal quotes omitted
see also bonito boats inc. v. thunder craft boats inc. 489_u.s._141 150-51 109_s.ct._971 103_l.ed.2d_118 9_uspq2d_1847 1852 1989 describing how the` carefully crafted bargain' of the patent system` depend [ s ] almost entirely upon a backdrop of free competition in the exploitation of unpatented designs and innovations
``

the courts have responded to such concerns by developing an array of legal limitations formulations and tests regarding the application of the doctrine of equivalents
these efforts reflect two animating concepts
the first is that the *1367 doctrine of equivalents is limited
it can not allow a patent_claim to encompass subject_matter that could not have been patented ; nor can it be used to ignore the actual language of the patent
thus we have held that the doctrine of equivalents can not allow a patent to encompass subject_matter existing in the prior_art
see wilson_sporting_goods co. v. david geoffrey & assoc. 904_f.2d_677 684 14_uspq2d_1942 1948 fed.cir.1990` [ a ] patentee should not be able to obtain under the doctrine of equivalents coverage which he could not lawfully have obtained from the pto by literal_claims
`` ; conroy v. reebok_int l ltd. 14_f.3d_1570 1577 29_uspq2d_1373 1378 fed.cir.1994 [ t ] he fundamental purpose of all [ doctrine of equivalents ] evaluations must be to prevent the patentee from` obtain [ ing ] under the doctrine of equivalents coverage which [ the patentee ] could not lawfully have obtained from the [ patent and trademark office ] by literal_claims' quoting wilson_sporting_goods
nor may it allow coverage of obvious or` trivial' variations of the prior_art see e.g. southwall_technologies inc. v. cardinal ig co. 54_f.3d_1570 1580 34_uspq2d_1673 1680 fed.cir.1995 for such_subject_matter could not have been lawfully patented in the first_instance
see 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a supp.1998` a patent may not be obtained.. if the difference between the subject_matter sought to be patented and the prior_art are such that the subject_matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person of ordinary_skill in the art`
it is also fundamental that the text of the claim must be closely followed` [ e ] ach element contained in a patent_claim is deemed material to defining the scope of the patented invention and thus the doctrine of equivalents must be applied to individual elements of the claim not to the invention as a whole'
warner-jenkinson 520 u.s. at 29 117_s.ct._1040 41 uspq2d at 1871
see also pennwalt corp. v. durand-wayland inc. 833_f.2d_931 935 4_uspq2d_1737 1739-40 fed.cir.1987 en banc
therefore the doctrine of equivalents can not be used to vitiate an element from the claim in its entirety
see warner-jenkinson 520 u.s. at 29 117_s.ct._1040 41 uspq2d at 1871 ; see also tronzo v. biomet inc. 156_f.3d_1154 1160 47_uspq2d_1829 1834 fed.cir.1998` if a theory of equivalence would vitiate a claim_limitation however then there can be no infringement under the doctrine of equivalents as a matter of law`
similarly where the patent document expressly identifies a role for a claim_limitation the doctrine of equivalents can not be used to capture subject_matter that does not substantially fulfill that role
see warner-jenkinson 520 u.s. at 40 117_s.ct._1040 41 uspq2d at 1875` an analysis of the role played by each element in the context of the specific patent_claim will thus inform the inquiry as to whether a substitute_element matches the function way and result of the claimed element or whether the substitute_element plays a role substantially different from the claim [ ] element

these limitations on the doctrine of equivalents are questions of law
see warner-jenkinson 520 u.s. at 39_n._8 117_s.ct._1040 41 uspq2d at 1875_n._8_(``of_course,_the_various_legal_limitations_on_the_application_of_the_doctrine_of_equivalents_are_to_be_determined_by_the_court.``)

the second conceptual limitation on the doctrine of equivalents is the idea that the patentee may not use the doctrine to recover subject_matter that has been surrendered
for example prosecution_history_estoppel will exclude from the doctrine of equivalents any subject_matter that was by amendment or argument during prosecution relinquished
see warner-jenkinson 520 u.s. at 30-31 117_s.ct._1040 41 uspq2d at 1871 ; *1368 litton sys. inc. v. honeywell inc. 140_f.3d_1449 1455 46_uspq2d_1321 1325 fed.cir.1998 prosecution_history_estoppel` bars recapture of that subject_matter actually surrendered during prosecution'
prosecution_history estoppel may in certain cases be presumed see warner-jenkinson 520 u.s. at 33 117_s.ct._1040 41 uspq2d at 1873 and the scope of such estoppel can be depending on the circumstances anywhere` from great to small to zero'

see also litton sys. 140 f.3d at 1462 46 uspq2d at 1331` [ t ] he scope of estoppel is a product of the effects of both [ amendments and arguments ] working in concert

in a similar vein we have also stated that particular subject_matter disclosed in the patent specification but not claimed is deemed to have been surrendered
see maxwell v. j. baker inc. 86_f.3d_1098 1106-07 39_uspq2d_1001 1006 fed.cir.1996
again these are questions of law
see warner-jenkinson 520 u.s. at 39_n._8 117_s.ct._1040 41 uspq2d at 1875_n._8

taken together these concepts-that the doctrine of equivalents is both limited and subject to estoppel-reflects this courts and the supreme_courts approach of maintaining the principled application of the doctrine of equivalents while hewing closely to the doctrines original purpose to prevent fraud on a patent
see graver_tank 339 u.s. at 608 70_s.ct._854 85 uspq at 330` the essence of the doctrine is that one may not practice fraud on a patent`
where these limitations are inapplicable the doctrine of equivalents operates to` prevent an infringer from stealing the benefit of an invention'

( quoting royal typewriter co. v. remington rand 168_f.2d_691 692 77_uspq_517 518 2d cir.1948 hand j.
to have this effect however the doctrine of equivalents must as noted above remain within the boundaries established by the prior_art the scope of the patent_claims themselves and any surrendered subject_matter

b
in this case k-2 asserts that the removable_screw attaching the heel of the bootie in salomons skate is substantially equivalent to the` permanently affixed' fastening required by the claims of the466_patent
salomon responds by arguing that k-2 during prosecution and reexamination surrendered any subject_matter encompassing a removable connection between the bootie and the base of the skate
we agree with salomon that the doctrine of equivalents as a matter of law can not encompass the accused skates removable_screw

the johnson_reference describes and depicts an in-line skate with an easily removable upper shoe portion that can be attached to the base of the skate
a second prior_art reference french patent no._2688,072 the` french_reference' teaches a soft_upper_bootie attached to the skate base with screws at the toe and the heel
given these two pieces of prior_art and the undisputed fact that the accused skate utilizes a removable_screw to attach the heel of the soft_upper_bootie to the base of the skate we have no trouble concluding that the doctrine of equivalents can not allow the466_patents` permanently affixed' limitation to expand to cover the accused devices removable_screw

first because the salomon_skates removable heel_screw is at most an obvious variation of the french_references screw_attachment and the johnson_references removable upper shoe either alone or taken in combination the doctrine of equivalents can not as a matter of law expand the466_patent to encompass the salomon_skate
to hold otherwise would allow the466_patent through the doctrine of equivalents to cover subject_matter that could not have been legally patented in the first_instance
cf
wilson_sporting_goods 904 f.2d at 684 14 uspq2d at 1948 ; conroy *1369 14 f.3d at 1576-77 29 uspq2d at 1378 ; southwall_technologies 54 f.3d at 1580 34 uspq2d at 1680

second the patentee during prosecution made amendments and statements that would lead a reasonable_competitor to objectively conclude that the subject_matter of removable_screw_attachments was relinquished
see e.g. sextant_avionique 172 f.3d at 826-27 49 uspq2d at 1871` the scope of the estoppel i.e. what subject_matter has been surrendered during prosecution by the patentee is to be determined from the vantage point of a reasonable_competitor of the patentee`
first the` permanently affixed' limitation of the466 claims was added in response to the examiners rejection of the claims in light of the johnson_reference
in doing so the applicant stated explicitly that the` permanently affixed' limitation distinguished the amended claims from the` detachable' shoe of the johnson_reference
during reexamination when the patentee cited the french_reference to the examiner the phrase` at least at said toe are and heel_area' was among the text added to the claims
given the relationship between the prior_art references the amendments made and the statements by the applicant one of ordinary_skill in the art would clearly conclude that removable_screw_attachments between the bootie and a base were relinquished

the district_court was correct in concluding that the salomon_skate could not infringe the466_patent under the doctrine of equivalents

c. salomon urges us to conclude that there is no discernible explanation in the prosecution_history for the` heel-and-toe' amendments discussed above
in this circumstance says salomon the presumption in favor of prosecution_history_estoppel established by the supreme_court in warner-jenkinson applies
see 520 u.s. at 33 117_s.ct._1040 41 uspq2d at 1873
thus salomon argues our recent decision in sextant_avionique compels the holding that the doctrine of equivalents can not be applied to the amended claim_limitations
see sextant_avionique 172 f.3d at 832 49 uspq2d at 1875` [ p ] rosecution_history estoppel arising from the operation of the warner-jenkinson_presumption allows the doctrine of equivalents no room to operate`
we disagree

whether or not an amendment was made for reasons of patentability is a legal question
see cybor corp. v. fas_technologies inc. 138_f.3d_1448 1460 46_uspq2d_1169 1178 fed.cir.1998 en banc application of prosecution_history_estoppel is a question of law ; litton sys. 140 f.3d at 1462 46 uspq2d at 1330 scope of prosecution_history_estoppel is a question of law ; sextant_avionique 172 f.3d at 826 49 uspq2d at 1870-71
in this case our review of the prosecution_history makes it plain that the amendments relevant here were made for a` substantial_reason related to patentability'
warner-jenkinson 520 u.s. at 33 117_s.ct._1040 41 uspq2d at 1875

the` heel-and-toe' amendments which were entered by the examiner during reexamination after a telephone conference with the patentee were made for such a reason
see id. 520 u.s. at 33 117_s.ct._1040 41 uspq2d at 1875
these amendments were entered after the citation of additional prior_art to the examiner including the highly relevant french_reference discussed above and unquestionably in light of the earlier art cited against the claims such as the johnson_reference
these facts make it clear that the patent would probably not have been re issued without the amendments which makes them of course` related to patentability'
id.at 33 117_s.ct._1040 41 uspq2d at 1875
see litton sys. 140 f.3d at 1461 46 uspq2d at 1330 amendments made without formal prior_art rejection can be` related to patentability'
the fact that the words were formally entered by the examiner after conversation with the applicant rather than the applicant does not affect the question of whether a substantial_reason related to patentability *1370 precipitated their addition
indeed salomon itself states that` it is clear that the examiner would not have allowed the claims over johnson and the other prior_art without the [ heel-and-toe ] limitations'
thus we conclude that the warner-jenkinson_presumption and the consequent bar against the doctrine of equivalents under sextant_avionique is inapplicable to this case
see e.g. bai v. l & l wings inc. 160_f.3d_1350 1355 48_uspq2d_1674 1677 fed.cir.1998 holding that where the reason for an amendment is clear from the prosecution_history the warner-jenkinson_presumption does not apply

conclusion
claim terms in general mean what they say
the district_court correctly interpreted the claim_limitation` permanently affixed' to require an unremovable_connection between the bootie and the base of the skate
we therefore affirm the district_courts holding that the salomon_skate can not as a matter of law literally infringe the466_patent
we also affirm the district_courts holding that the doctrine of equivalents can not as a matter of law be used to expand the466 claims to cover the salomon_skate
the summary_judgment in favor of salomon is affirmed

rader circuit_judge dissenting
the court today determines that the` ordinary and accustomed_meaning' of the claim_term` permanently affixed' summarily precludes both literal_infringement and infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
my reading of patent_law and the patent in this case suggest a different result

with regard to claim_interpretation this court reaches a hasty unsupported judgment on the meaning of the term` permanently'
this court opines that it` need only recognize that claim_construction is firmly anchored in reality by the understanding of those of ordinary_skill in the art'
yet this court does not even consider the meaning an ordinary in-line skate artisan would attach to` permanently'
instead this court summarily concludes that the term` permanent' should mean what it thinks it should mean

divorced from context words lose their ordinary and accustomed_meanings
see e.g. autogiro_co. of america v. united_states 181_ct.cl._55 384_f.2d_391 397 155_uspq_697 702 ct.cl.1967` claims can not be clear and unambiguous on their face`
`` permanent' in the context of mountain ranges can mean millennia ;` permanent' in the context of hair treatments can mean until the next rain storm ;` permanent' in the context of creased pants can mean until the next long airline trip in coach class ;` permanent' in the context of genetic combinations can mean until the next mutation
when judges intuit an ordinary and accustomed_meaning divorced from context they are usually unwittingly imposing their own subjective linguistic values on a public decision

as this court verbally recognizes but substantively ignores the understanding of one of ordinary_skill in the art sets the proper_context for the meaning of claim_terms
see markman v. westview instruments inc. 52_f.3d_967 986 34_uspq2d_1321 1335 fed.cir.1995 en banc` [ t ] he focus in construing disputed terms in claim_language is.. on the objective test of what one of ordinary_skill in the art at the time of the invention would have understood the term to mean`
the art in this case is in-line_skates
the reexamined466_patent_claims an in-line skate with improved responsiveness to the foot movements of a skater
the patent achieves this result by permanently affixing a flexible_shoe upper to the base
the terms` permanent' and` non-removable' therefore in proper_context refer to a relationship between the shoe and the base

*1371 this courts opinion gives absolutely no context or support for its` ordinary and accustomed_meaning' of` permanently affixed'
instead it begins with its conclusion-' [ t ] he ordinary and accustomed_meaning of this phrase.. does not encompass affixation via removable_screw' - and does not consider any evidence from those of ordinary_skill in the art
this courts extremely narrow interpretation of this phrase could potentially deny the patentee almost any coverage because in the theoretical out-of-context reading of this court almost nothing is permanent
after all those of skill in this art may recognize that even lamination the method of affixation described in the patent is removable with a chemical solvent
in fact an adhesive affixation may to those of skill in this art in fact be less permanent becoming loose over time than screws for connecting shoes to skates
this summary proceeding record does not supply the context necessary for an accurate decision
nonetheless this court dismisses the question on the basis of a supposed ordinary and accustomed_meaning

although the court construed the claim_language out of context its biggest stretch is its fact-finding on appeal about the nature of the accused skate
this court hastily finds that the accused skate affixes the shoe to the base with a` removable_screw'
on this purely factual issue nonetheless resolved summarily and on appeal the record contains no evidence that the accused skates screw was ever removed or would ever be removed for any purpose
hence a conclusion about whether the screw was or was not` meant to be unscrewed' is premature
indeed the record shows that the flexible_shoe of the accused skate was permanently attached to the base at the toe_area by use of rivets and an unremovable ?
screw
therefore even if a user disassembled the accused shoe to gain access to the allegedly` removable' heel_screw that user could not remove the shoe from the base because the four rivets and the apparently unremovable_screw in the toe would ensure the` shoe portion' remained` permanently affixed' to` said base_portion'
this court nevertheless finds that the heel_screw is` removable' without any evidence that it was ever removed or` meant to be' removed at all - a particularly egregious stretch on appeal from summary_judgment

this court protests too much ?
that it will` not create a genuine_issue of material_fact where the parties agree that none exists'
in doing so however it betrays the dangers of fact-finding on appeal
specifically this court states that k-2` fully acknowledges.. that the heel_screw isremovable
`` certainly k-2 did not concede away its entire case
indeed an examination of the full context of k-2s statement shows that this court has taken sides in a factual dispute
k-2 in their reply_brief explains though the screw at the heel of the [ accused ] skate can be removed with effort it is not substantially different from a permanent or non-removable connection
as with gluing or laminating the base and shoe are held tightly together and` become one'
indeed unlike the johnson soft shoe the heel_portion of the non-rigid [ accused ] skate shoe can not be removed from the base
rather at most it can be pried up slightly so that a piece of paper can be wedged underneath
( emphasis added
again at the other place cited to show that k-2` fully acknowledges' that the screw is removable k-2 in fact explains in its reply_brief though the screws can be removed with effort the rivets prevent the shoe which includes the integrally-connected toe and heel_portions from being removed without destroying it
thus this court has imposed its definition of` removable' and its factual view of the accused skate on k-2 thus resolving on appeal - without testimony and without a full record - the factual_issues which are the heart of this dispute in the first place
the point is that the record shows no instance of removal of the heel_screw and *1372 no purpose for ever removing the heel_screw because the connection of shoe to skate remains` permanent' in any event
is a screw that has never been removed and will never be removed` removable ?'
does it make a difference if it is removable in the surreal sense adopted by this court because the shoe remains` permanently affixed' to the skate` for substantially preventing movement_therebetween ?'
this court decides these factual_issues on appeal and on summary_judgment

this courts hasty judgment about the nature of the accused skate includes reasoning about prosecution_history
in this case however the johnson prior_art and the prosecution_history indisputably discuss only skates which accommodated complete removal and replacement of the shoe
thus the prior_art emphasized disassembly and removal not permanent fixation
the rivets in the toe and the unremovable` removable_screw' already removes this accused device from any similarity with the prior_art from which the patentee distinguished itself

in sum this court could only have resolved infringement in this case particularly infringement by equivalents by undertaking extensive fact finding on summary_judgment and on appeal
sadly finding on appeal that the screw is` removable' and summarily importing a meaning for` permanent' removes this judgment from any permanent_connection with the in-line skate art

we are puzzled by the dissents insistence that additional fact-finding is required with respect to the` removable' nature of the heel_screw
k-2 does not dispute-indeed it fully acknowledges-that the heel_screw is removable and that removing the heel_screw allows the heel_portion of the bootie to lift` slightly' upwards away from the base
