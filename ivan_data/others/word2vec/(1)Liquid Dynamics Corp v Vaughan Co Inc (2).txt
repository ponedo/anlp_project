opinion
gajarsa circuit_judge
this is the second time we have heard an appeal in this case
in the previous appeal liquid dynamics` ld' contested the claim_construction and summary_judgment of non-infringement entered against it
liquid_dynamics_corp. v. vaughan_co. 355_f.3d_1361 fed.cir.2004` ld_i`
in that decision we found error in the district_courts claim_construction vacated the grant of summary_judgment and remanded for proceedings based on the revised claim_construction
id

on remand the district_court held a six-day jury trial to determine whether vaughan company inc.` vaughan' infringed claims 1_and_8 of u.s. patent no._5458,414` the414_patent` and whether the414_patent was valid
on october 25 *1213 2004 the jury returned a verdict that vaughan had infringed the414_patent that the infringement was willful and that vaughan failed to prove that the414_patent was invalid
the jury awarded damages to ld in the amount of $ 1,183,722

subsequently the district_court held a bench trial on vaughans allegation of inequitable_conduct but granted lds motion for judgment as a matter of law on that issue at the close of evidence
final judgment was entered on november 15 2004 and the district_court subsequently denied vaughans judgment-as-a-matter-of-law` jmol' and new-trial motions on the issues of invalidity infringement and willfulness
thereafter the district_court granted in part lds motions for enhanced damages and attorneys fees
the court trebled the jurys damage award based upon the jurys willfulness finding and` vaughans behavior as a litigant'
separately the court awarded attorneys fees amounting to $ 1,501,239
the court also entered a permanent_injunction on february 25 2005

vaughan now appeals the district_courts denial of its jmol_motion for non-infringement invalidity no willful_infringement and unenforceability due to inequitable_conduct
further vaughan appeals the district_courts orders for a permanent_injunction enhanced damages and attorneys fees
for the reasons stated below we affirm the judgment of the district_court

i
background
the414_patent involves a system of pumps that stir mixtures of solids and liquids in large 1,000,000-gallon tanks
the invention is primarily directed to applications for mixing wastewater and manure
because we have already detailed the invention and its background in ld_i we reproduce only a summary of the relevant facts below this case involves the structure of slurry tanks
slurry tanks are used to store and process chemicals and organic waste products e.g. manure that retain value as useful inputs e.g. fertilizer into other processes
large storage_tanks house these waste_compounds in liquid or semisolid form between their production and their subsequent use
the liquid and solid_components of these waste_compounds tend to separate when stored with solid particles either forming a crust on the top of the tank and/or falling to the bottom of the tank
productive use of the stored compound requires remixing both to suspend the heavy solid particles within the liquid and to ensure that the resulting suspension is uniform
one standard approach has been to stir the mix continuously to avoid settling
because continuous mixing can be expensive however tank designers sought ways to store the mixtures in a still tank to allow the settling to occur and to remix only when necessary for use
the414_patent addressed these concerns

a
the414_patent
claims 1_and_8 are the contested claims in this case
the patent recites a method and apparatus for handling wastewater slurries a storage_tank equipped with submerged agitators capable of generating a flow of liquid throughout the tank
with the relevant language underlined claim 1 reads 1
apparatus for storing a slurry having solid and liquid components comprising a storage_tank defining a volume for holding a body of liquid and solid_slurry_components including a floor of generally *1214 circular configuration and having a center said storage_tank further including an outer surrounding wall positioned generally at a radial_distance from the center ; at least two flow_generating means positioned to be submerged within the liquid and solid_slurry_components for generating flow of at least one of the slurry_components along a rotational direction each of said flow_generating means being disposed at distances from the center ranging between approximately 30 percent and 70 percent of said radial_distance ; each of said first and second_flow_generating means being pointed toward the outer surrounding wall for generating a substantial_helical_flow path of the liquid and solid_components therein with the liquid and solid_components traveling outwardly across the tank_floor from the center portion of the tank toward the tank wall and then upwardly along the tank outer surrounding wall to a first point and then inwardly along an upper portion of the body toward the center of the tank and then downwardly toward the tank_floor and then outwardly to a second point spaced circumferentially in the direction of rotation of the entire_body of liquid the liquid and solid_components continuing to travel in the helical_path as the entire_body of liquid and solid_components continues to rotate ; a pressure source coupled to the first and second_flow_generating means to generate directed streams from the flow_generating means to rotate the body of liquid and solid_components and to cause the flow in the helical_path ; and
said flow_generating means creating a substantially volume filling flow of at least one of the slurry_components within said storage_tank which mixes the liquid and solid_slurry_components to form a substantially homogeneous slurry suitable for unloading from said storage_tank using liquid handling devices
'414_patent col._8,_l._56- col._9,_l._39 emphases added
in ld_i we construed the term` substantial_helical_flow' to be` all flow_patterns that are generally though not necessarily perfectly spiral and that fill much though not necessarily all of the tanks volume'
ld_i 355 f.3d at 1369
claim 8 includes the relevant terms from claim 1
the written description includes the following examples of tank arrangement and helical_flow_path

b
prior art and pre-filing activities
the inventors named in the414_patent james m. crump and bruce k. doyle jr. were dealers for the a.o
smith corporation` a.o.smith' and sold a.o
smiths tank agitation system containing a single center-mounted rotatable agitator nozzle known as the slurrystore_system
according to crump in 1990 the inventors first became involved with the slurrystore_system when a.o
smith asked them to help move a tank from a farm to a wastewater treatment plant in plymouth indiana

commonwealth engineering plymouths engineering firm redesigned the tank for use in the wastewater plant by moving the original agitator away from the tank_center and adding a second agitator that was placed on the same radial line on the same side of the tank
the first and second agitators were placed at a distance of approximately 25_and_75 percent respectively from the tanks center to the wall
the nozzles were designed to rotate in position so that the workers could agitate different sections and clean out the tank when needed
according to crump this new design did not help the mixing because the tank slurry was still only agitated in zones and not throughout the whole tank
at startup the plymouth_tank did not operate *1216 properly until flow reducers were installed on the nozzles to impart more energy into the liquid volume
ld presented a video tape made in january of 1992 showing that flow occurred in only one section of the plymouth_tank and not the entire tank

in the summer and fall of 1991 crump and doyle designed and sold the next relevant tank system to a hog processing plant called indiana_packers
ld claims the indiana_packers_tank was the same as the plymouth_tank and did not embody the invention claimed by the414_patent
crumps diagrams and testimony suggest that the indiana_packers_tank was similar in layout to plymouth and like plymouth only mixed the liquid in zones

in april of 1991 the inventors submitted a proposal to a.o
smith asking that a patent_application be filed for their invention for zone mixing within the indiana_packers and plymouth_tanks
a.o
smith declined to develop the proposal because it appeared that the invention as described was not patentable
crump testified that in february of 1992 he and doyle began to develop the idea for mixing throughout the entire tank volume instead of just mixing in one zone at a time as the plymouth and indiana_packers designs provided
the414_patent incorporating the concept of volume-filling flow was filed on may_7,_1992
although the original application did not claim a substantially helical_flow_path it was later amended to claim such a flow path

crump further testified that on may_20,_1991 he offered to sell another system for antibiotic industrial waste to eli_lilly just after the critical_date
according to crump the eli_lilly system was not only offered after the critical_date its nozzle_placement was not even within the limitations of the patent
at the time the patent was filed the plymouth indiana_packers and eli_lilly tanks had been installed

c. infringement_evidence
1
vaughans business history
vaughan designs and manufactures` chopper pumps' which are used to mix solid materials in large_tanks
it claims to have supplied ld with pumps for many years
vaughan also claims that it was in the business of large-tank mixing designs decades before the414_patent with its roof-mounted chopper pump design called` scumbuster'

vaughan and lds relationship soured when vaughan began manufacturing floor mounted systems and bid on a tank for the city of augusta georgia
ld claims to have been negotiating with augusta in late 1999 to supply augusta with its jetmix_system the commercial product covered by the414_patent
in december of 1999 ld terminated flichard behnke a sales engineer who had been` intimately involved' with the augusta_design and negotiations
soon thereafter behnke was hired by vaughan and submitted engineering_drawings for nozzle layouts to augusta which vaughan presented as its flotamix system
ld claims these drawings were directly copied by behnke from lds previous engineering_drawings
ld also includes statements from glenn dorsch vaughans chief engineer and vice president stating what is planned and requested is for us to remove the [ ld ] jetmix nozzles from the drawings and put in our own floor mounts..
this should be very easy for wade to do once we get final orientations from rich behnke
vaughan notes that even though the nozzles were located in the same place they constituted a special dual-nozzle_design
thus whereas the ld jetmix design had six nozzles vaughans design had twelve

*1217 2
vaughans business records as infringement_evidence
ld confronted vaughan with allegations of infringement of the414_patent and in june of 2000 vaughan consulted with patent_counsel to evaluate the414_patent and vaughans potentially infringing rotamix_design
at about the same time vaughan commissioned aea technology to perform two different computational fluid dynamics` cfd' studies to analyze the flow_patterns in its tanks
the first study labeled px20 evaluated a generic 50-foot-diameter tank that was 30-feet high
the second labeled px19 was a study conducted for a proposed tank at merced california that demonstrated the tanks mixing capabilities to the citys engineer
dorsch testified that these studies were representative of the flow_patterns generated by vaughans rotamix systems

vaughan provided patent_counsel with these studies to assist in forming an opinion relative to infringement
based on the cfd_studies and the tank designs patent_counsel rendered an opinion for vaughan concluding that its rotamix_design did not infringe the414_patent because it did not produce substantially helical_flow

ld relies on vaughans cfd_studies as evidence of both infringement and willfulness
the report not only shows toroidial1 flow in the vertical_plane with downward velocity in the center of the tank and upward velocity at the walls of the tank but it also indicates there was a` concern over terrodial [ sic ] flow'
moreover as ld notes the author of the px20 report explained that` the momentum from the nozzles pushes the fluid to the side_walls of the tank' and` then changes direction and heads up the side_walls'
lds own expert lueptow relied on these same vertical_vector_plots to express a similar opinion that vaughans tanks generate helical_flow

3
structure evidence
next ld relies on testimony regarding the structure of vaughans designs and their similarity to the414_patent claims
dorsch vaughans chief engineer and its technical expert at trial testified that the vaughan_engineering_manual included specifications and drawings showing vaughans regular method of installation
vaughan did not keep accurate records of each of the 47 allegedly infringing installations
lds technical expert gillette a wastewater treatment engineer reviewed the engineering records for all of the accused systems prepared a report establishing the parameters of each installation and testified regarding the systems and any missing installation data

vaughan correctly points out that gillettes report lacks nozzle_placement and/or nozzle_angle data for 11 of the 47 systems
however dorsch testified that if records on construction were missing it would be reasonable to assume that the installation was in accordance with the standard procedure described in vaughans engineering_manual

4
lds cfd analysis
ld contends that 47 vaughan installations infringe the414_patent
since some installations are duplicates there are 34 unique tank designs
of these vaughan argues that there is insufficient_evidence to prove that two contested claim elements are present in the accused tanks namely` substantial_helical_flow' and` rotation of the entire_body'
in addition to vaughans business records and its own *1218 cfd_analysis ld relies heavily on lueptows expert opinion
his opinion concludes that each of the 47 installments infringe by recreating the substantially helical_flow_path
ld supports lueptows conclusions with the following evidence in the record 1 vaughans two cfd_studies for the generic 50-foot and merced tanks ; 2 lds prelitigation cfd study modeling the merced tank ; 3 observation of a tank in argos indiana ; and 4 lueptows own_cfd_analysis of nine tank configurations representative of various vaughan installations

lueptow performed his own_cfd_analysis of the vaughan_systems using the same software vaughan had used in its own cfd_studies ; however he did not recreate each of the 47 tanks at issue in this case because cfds are very time intensive
instead he modeled the flows in nine representative tanks with various tank sizes and nozzle configurations depending on different vaughan designs
lueptow based these models on the vaughan engineering manual and gillettes testimony
gillette had testified that there was information missing in the record detailing some tank_characteristics but that he nonetheless had sufficient information to summarize the tank_characteristics for flow modeling

lueptows cfd work resulted in 116 different graphical plots consisting of path-line and vector_plots
the vector_plots detailed the overall flow path and magnitude in the horizontal and vertical_planes
the path-line plots estimated the path an individual particle travels within the tank
lueptow concluded that the vaughan_systems were very robust and would produce the helical_flow despite small changes to each tank
he opined that his representative systems and tanks allowed him to render an opinion on all 47 tanks
this opinion based on the nine cfd models lueptow created the vaughan data from merced and a generic 50-foot tank and lds merced model was that infringing helical and volume-filling flow is present in all 47 models

during trial vaughan challenged lueptows analysis maintaining that the plots simulated conditions just mere seconds after pump startup and that this could not be sufficient_evidence of helical and rotational_flow during steady-state flow
lueptow however testified that his models were sufficient to determine that helical and rotational_flow existed despite the fact that only 40_to_50 iterations were performed

b
infringement_evidence
vaughans first alleged error is that ld presented insufficient_evidence that each of the 47 accused installations infringed
first it explains that ld did not present sufficient_evidence that 11 of the 47 installations met the required nozzle_placement and nozzle_angle limitations required by claims 1_and_8
second vaughan argues that lds computer_simulations presented at trial were inaccurate and therefore did not provide evidence of infringement
third vaughan contends that there is no evidence vaughan knew or intended that 11 of its systems which are located outside the united_states indirectly infringe

1
tank structure limitations
the414_patent requires that the tank_nozzles be placed within 25_to_75 percent of the tanks annular radius and that the nozzle_angle be sufficient to` generate flows.. [ that ] impart a rotational movement of the entire_body of liquid'
'414_patent col._9,_ll._4-12
vaughan explains that the structural_data compiled by gillette do not provide nozzle_angles for 11 installations and do not provide radial_distances and relative nozzle_placements for 8 of those 11 installations
further it points out that dorsch testified to his knowledge of four installations with nozzles located outside the annular regions claimed by the patent

ld agrees that 11 of the tanks had some missing structural information ; however it submits dorschs testimony stating that even where there is missing information one could generally reconstruct a tank using the specification in the vaughan_engineering_manual
moreover it contends that the vaughan_engineering_manual shows nozzle_placement within the claim limitations and that one drawing is almost an exact duplicate of the augusta installation

our task on appeal is to determine whether the jury could reasonably have inferred from the engineering_manual and dorschs testimony that 11 installations infringe even though some structural_data is missing from vaughans records
ld argues this was a reasonable weighing of the evidence that is exclusively within the province of the jury
we agree

a patentee may prove direct_infringement or inducement of infringement by either direct or circumstantial_evidence
moleculon research corp. v. cbs inc. 793_f.2d_1261 1272 fed.cir.1986
there is no requirement that direct_evidence be introduced nor is a jurys preference for circumstantial_evidence over direct_evidence unreasonable per se
see fuji_photo_film_co. v. jazz photo corp. 394_f.3d_1368 1374 fed.cir.2005 ; moleculon research 793 f.2d at 1272 noting` it is hornbook law that direct_evidence of a fact is not necessary' ; see also michalic v. cleveland tankers inc. 364_u.s._325 330 81_s.ct._6 5_l.ed.2d_20_(1960)` circumstantial evidence is not only sufficient but may also be more certain satisfying and persuasive than direct_evidence`
though dorsch testified that four tanks were outside the scope of the patent claims the jury could reasonably have discredited that evidence and given more weight to the circumstantial_evidence of the vaughan_engineering_manual which *1220 was created before litigation began
similarly the jury could reasonably rely on the engineering_manual and complete records for the remaining vaughan designs to infer that the missing information on 11 tanks also had infringing structural components

both parties argue that the other should have submitted additional evidence regarding the tank_parameters
though it is lds burden to prove infringement it chose to rely on circumstantial_evidence for some installations
while direct_evidence may have made lds case of infringement stronger it does not render the case presented to the jury unreasonable as a matter of law
indeed the jury could have reasonably inferred from the evidence submitted that each of the tanks infringed the claims
thus we hold that there is substantial_evidence that all 47 accused tanks met the structural_limitations of the414_patent

2
computer simulations
next vaughan challenges the computer_simulations used to establish the helical-and rotational-flow claim limitations
vaughan maintains that lueptows simulations were insufficient for two reasons 1 because the parameters used to run the nine different modeled simulations were inaccurate and 2 because the simulations do not show the required helical_flow and general_body_rotation

a. lueptows model parameters
first vaughan argues that the modeling parameters were inaccurate
it notes specifically that the simulated tank a and tank g groupings in lueptows cfds did not match or approximate many of the known tank_parameters such as the height flow rate and nozzle diameter
lueptow admitted that these parameters did not match the real-world parameters as vaughan points out but he also testified that the changes in the nozzle_design would do little to disrupt the robust helical_flow in the tanks
furthermore lueptow performed a simulation of the tank d parameters with different nozzle spacing and concluded that even though the parameters changed and some aspects of the flow changed the helical_flow was still present

vaughan appears to challenge the admissibility and reliability of lueptows expert scientific analysis and opinion
ld argues that our previous_opinion reversing the district_courts grant of summary_judgment based on the genuine_issue of material_fact presented by the vector_plots makes the evidence admissible under the law-of-the-case_doctrine
our previous_opinion ld_i did not directly consider the admissibility of the evidence only that such evidence would be sufficient to create a genuine_issue of material_fact for trial
355 f.3d at 1371
issues not decided by the court in a prior proceeding are not covered by the law-of-the-case_doctrine
stearns v. beckman instruments inc. 737_f.2d_1565 1568 fed.cir.1984
therefore the admissibility of lueptows testimony had not been previously resolved

vaughans challenges to expert_testimony and scientific_evidence are analyzed under the supreme_courts daubert factors
see daubert v. merrell dow pharm. inc. 509_u.s._579 589 113_s.ct._2786 125_l.ed.2d_469_(1993)
when faced with expert scientific testimony a district_court must first determine` whether the expert is proposing to testify to 1 scientific knowledge that 2 will assist the trier of fact to understand or determine a fact at issue'
id.at 592 113_s.ct._2786
this requires an assessment of the reasoning and methodology underlying the testimony to determine whether it is scientifically valid
id
in daubert the supreme_court set forth four factors for district_courts to *1221 consider when evaluating the validity and relevance of scientific_evidence pursuant to rule 702 of the federal rules of evidence
id.at 592-93 113_s.ct._2786
these factors include 1 whether the methodology can and has been tested 2 whether the methodology is subject to peer review 3 the potential rate of error and 4 the general acceptance of the methodology
id.at 593-94 113_s.ct._2786
the court further noted that the focus of a courts inquiry into the relevance and reliability of scientific_evidence` must be solely on principles and methodology not on the conclusions that they generate'
id.at 595 113_s.ct._2786

here vaughans argument focuses on the parameters lueptow applied not on the reliability of cfd_analysis in general
indeed cfd_analysis has been previously recognized in the scientific community and has been recognized as reliable by at least one circuit
see quiet_tech dc-8 inc. v. hurel-dubois uk ltd. 326_f.3d_1333 1343-44 11th cir.2003
in quiet_tech. the appellant challenged the credibility of cfd_analysis for modeling aerodynamic_properties in a jet engine
id.at 1344
the appellant argued that the expert used incorrect data or was missing data to run the cfd software and used the wrong equations to run his cfd_analysis of the engines aerodynamic_properties
id
such a flawed analysis it argued made the testimony and evidence unreliable
id.at 1344-45
the court held that such an attack goes more to the weight of the evidence than to its admissibility
`` the identification of such flaws in generally reliable scientific_evidence is precisely the role of cross-examination'
id.at 1345 ; see also in re tmi litig. 193_f.3d_613 692 3d cir.1999`so long as the experts testimony rests upongood grounds it should be tested by the adversary process-competing expert_testimony and active cross-examination-rather than excluded from jurors [ ] scrutiny for fear that they will not grasp its complexities or satisfactory [ sic ] weigh its inadequacies
`` quoting ruiz-troche v. pepsi cola of puerto rico bottling co. 161_f.3d_77 85 1st cir.1998 ; wilmington v. j.i
case co. 793_f.2d_909 920 8th cir.1986` virtually all the inadequacies in the experts testimony urged here by [ the defendant ] were brought out forcefully at trial..
these matters go to the weight of the experts testimony rather than to its admissibility
``

here vaughans challenge goes to the weight of the evidence rather than the admissibility of lueptows testimony and analysis
though he admitted that his models did not exactly match the various accused tanks this fact was fully discussed on cross_examination
as in quiet_tech. his models were not the perfect models of each individual tank but they were based on reliable scientific methodology and subject to cross_examination and the proffering of further scientific analysis by vaughan
we conclude that a reasonable_juror could consider lueptows testimony explaining the very robust helical_flow in the models and infer that the similar accused tanks will produce flow similar to the modeled flow
therefore we will not contravene the province of the jury by reweighing lueptows testimony

b
alleged flows
vaughans challenges do not end with allegations of inaccurate data
it also challenges the relevance of lueptows testimony regarding general rotation of the fluid in combination with the helical_flow
vaughan argues that lueptows analysis performed only 40_to_50 iterations a time frame that it suggests is only a few seconds after pump startup and therefore was not enough time to rotate the entire_body of fluid

*1222 however such arguments do not overcome lueptows testimony that there was helical_flow and general_body_rotation in his simulation even after 50 iterations
furthermore lueptow did not rely solely on his cfd plots but also on those that were admittedly continued for longer periods of time by vaughan and ld when they simulated the merced and generic tanks at aea technologies
any fault within lueptows opinion was properly covered during cross_examination
but sufficient_evidence still existed for a reasonable_juror to find infringement

vaughans last contention with the cfd_analysis counters lds reliance on the vertical_vector_plots from the px19 and px20 reports by presenting an argument that they are unreliable
basically vaughan argues that movement shown in the vector_plots represents the single-plane movement of a particle flowing in two planes vertical and horizontal
for purposes of determining helical_flow the vertical-plane vector plot is critical
vaughan explains that the vertical plot shows particles with very little movement in the vertical_plane but much more substantial movement in the horizontal plane
it contends that the vertical_vector_plot in the px19 report is consistent with a rotational vortex as in the prior_art rather than helical_flow
essentially it maintains that even though the vertical_vector_plots look helical the actual particles are moving like a whirlpool around a common center and that even in that configuration there will be flow upward and downward somewhere in the tank

while vaughans interpretation could be correct the evidence presented suggests that the vertical_vector_plot is subject to different interpretations
there was substantial_evidence presented to the jury to suggest that this plot represents a helical pattern
the plot appears to show two vortices on either side of the tank_center
while these vortices may be aided by the fluid intake sump in the tank_center it appears clear in this figure that the downward speeds increase towards the pumps
furthermore for both the px19 and px20 reports their authors acknowledge that flow vortices do exist in the vertical_plane
upon consideration of the evidence the jury may have had a different interpretation than that postulated by vaughan
there is certainly substantial_evidence to support this jurys findings

3
foreign infringement
vaughan makes one final argument with respect to infringement under 35 u.s.c.¡± 271 f by six tanks located outside of the united_states
it argues that under ¡± 271 f there was insufficient_evidence that it intended for the foreign_purchasers to infringe the414_patent
pursuant to ¡± 271 f 1 a party may be an infringer if it
supplies.. in or from the united_states all or a substantial portion of the components of a patented_invention where such_components are uncombined in whole or in part in such manner as to actively induce the combination of such_components outside of the united_states in a manner that would infringe the patent if such combination occurred within the united_states..' a finding of inducement requires both an underlying instance of direct_infringement and a requisite showing of intent'
fuji_photo_film_co. 394 f.3d at 1377
here although vaughan contends that the requisite intent showing is missing` [ a ] patentee may prove intent through circumstantial_evidence'
id

accordingly ld identifies evidence in the record that vaughan knew of the414_patent after its first sale to augusta
moreover vaughans hiring of behnke a *1223 former l.d employee with knowledge of the patented design and dorschs statements indicating that vaughan was relying on nozzle orientations from behnke support the proposition that vaughan intended for its augusta_design to infringe the claims of the414_patent
furthermore vaughans engineering_manual was sent to its customers and is replete with examples that are similar to the augusta_designs
this constitutes circumstantial_evidence that vaughan intended for its subsequent buyers including foreign buyers to install systems that infringe the claims of the414_patent
vaughan argues that the engineering_manual itself expresses an intent to mix by rotation such that vaughans dissemination of the manual did not intend its customers to create the infringing helical_flow
vaughans arguments ask us to reweigh the evidence a task reserved for the jury not this court
see teleflex inc. v. ficosa n. am corp. 299_f.3d_1313 1335 fed.cir.2002
thus we hold that there is substantial_evidence to support the jurys verdict under ¡± 271 f

c. invalidity of the414_patent
vaughans second allegation of error is that the court should have found the414_patent invalid because the specification did not disclose the inventors best_mode of practicing the invention and did not enable the claims
see bj_servs co. v. halliburton energy servs. 338_f.3d_1368 1371-72 fed.cir.2003 ; eli_lilly & co. v. barr labs. 251_f.3d_955 963 fed.cir.2001
it argues that the inventors failed to disclose the need for reducers on the tank_nozzles and that the specification failed to enable the creation of helical_flow in the tank

1
best mode
vaughan argues that the use of reducers on the tank_nozzles was the best_mode of practicing the invention that it was known to the inventors and that they failed to disclose it in their patent_application
vaughan presented evidence that the inventors installed reducers on the plymouth and indiana_packers_tanks in order to increase flow velocity and impart more momentum into the large_tanks

inventors are required by 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
1 to disclose the best_mode for practicing their claimed inventions
a finding of patent invalidity based on best_mode` requires clear and convincing_evidence that the inventor both knew of and concealed a better mode of carrying out the claimed invention than that set forth in the specification'
teleflex 299 f.3d at 1330
this is a two-part factual test inquiring into 1 whether the inventor subjectively` considered a particular mode of practicing the invention to be superior to all other modes at the time of filing' the application and 2 whether the inventor adequately disclosed that superior mode
id
; accord eli_lilly & co. 251 f.3d at 963
the best_mode_requirement does not require the disclosure of` routine details' that would be apparent to one of ordinary_skill in the art practicing the invention
teleflex 299 f.3d at 1331-32
`` known ways of performing a known operation can not be deemed intentionally concealed absent evidence of intent to deliberately withhold that information'
high concrete structures inc. v. new enter
stone & lime co. 377_f.3d_1379 1384 fed.cir.2004

in light of all the evidence presented on this issue a reasonable_jury could conclude that vaughan failed to demonstrate by clear and convincing_evidence that ld did not disclose the best_mode
first the414_patent states that` [ t ] he jet nozzle units 20 are preferably of a type disclosed in u.s. pat
no._4332,484 herein incorporated by reference [the484_patent ] and commercially available from *1224 a.o
smith as part of its slurrystore..
systems'
'414_patent col._4,_ll._52-55
the484_patent describes a nozzle that discharges` a high velocity high volume jet' col._3,_ll._50-51 and a nozzle which is` concentrically reduced in diameter in its upward extend..' col._3,_ll._65-68
second crump testified that the plymouth and indiana_packers_installations did not incorporate the invention and were used to achieve zone mixing instead of helical_flow
third ld presented evidence that adding reducers is a routine detail and did not need to be disclosed to a person of ordinary_skill in the art
fourth lueptow testified that a particular flow velocity did not matter given that the fluid_flow began to dissipate further from the nozzle

admittedly the414_patent does not disclose a particular size of reducer but vaughan failed to demonstrate by clear and convincing_evidence that it must
ideal flow rates and flow velocities depend on the nature of the tank to be mixed
moreover vaughan has not made a sufficient showing to overcome the jury determination that the best_mode_requirement was satisfied

2
enablement
vaughan argues that the414 specification fails to enable the claimed helical_flow
it contends that crumps testimony that he did not discover helical_flow until after his patent_application was filed is proof that the specification does not enable the claim to such flow.2

in order to enable the claims of a patent pursuant to ¡± 112 the patent_specification must teach those of ordinary_skill in the art` how to make and use the full scope of the claimed invention without undue_experimentation'
bruning v. hirose 161_f.3d_681 686 fed.cir.1998
some experimentation is permissible although it can not be unduly excessive
hybritech inc. v. monoclonal antibodies inc. 802_f.2d_1367 1384 fed.cir.1986
enablement is a question of law which we ultimately review de novo but it is based on factual findings that are reviewed for clear_error
bruning 161 f.3d at 686
here because the underlying inquiry was inherently factual` we look to whether a reasonable_jury could have made the underlying factual findings necessary to provide substantial_evidence in support of its conclusion'
bj_servs co. 338 f.3d at 1371-72

first ld submitted gillettes testimony to establish that even though the patent does not discuss a specific combination of elements to create helical_flow it could be produced by a person of ordinary_skill in the art without undue_experimentation
second crumps testimony indicates that he conceived of the idea of producing helical_flow in late 1991 or early 1992 constructively reduced his idea to practice in the patent_application then confirmed that the helical_flow could be produced in his later tank designs
this testimony along with lueptows indication that helical_flow is robust provides substantial_evidence that helical_flow could be generated *1225 by following the414_patent written description

d. willful infringement
vaughan also argues that there was not clear and convincing_evidence to support the jurys verdict of willful_infringement
vaughans only contentions are that there was no basis on which the jury could disregard vaughans reliance on counsels opinion of non-infringement and that there was insufficient_evidence that vaughan copied the augusta system

a finding of willful_infringement is made after considering the totality of the circumstances
see knorr-bremse systeme fuer nutzfahrzeuge gmbh v. dana corp. 383_f.3d_1337 1342-43 fed.cir.2004 en banc
the evidence is weighed and evaluated by the trier of fact
id.at 1343
`` the drawing of inferences particularly in respect of an intent-implicating question such as willfulness is peculiarly within the province of the fact_finder that observed the witnesses'
rolls-royce ltd. v. gte valeron corp. 800_f.2d_1101 1110 fed.cir.1986

courts consider several factors when determining whether an infringer has acted in bad faith and whether damages should be increased
they include` 1 whether the infringer deliberately copied the ideas or design of another ; 2 whether the infringer when he knew of the others patent protection investigated the scope of the patent and formed a good-faith belief that it was invalid or that it was not infringed ;.. 3 the infringers behavior as a party to the litigation ;' 4` defendants size and financial condition ;' 5` closeness of the case ;' 6` duration of defendants misconduct ;' 7` remedial action by the defendant ;' 8` defendants motivation for harm ;' and 9` whether defendant attempted to conceal its misconduct'
read corp. v. portec inc. 970_f.2d_816 826-27 fed.cir.1992 superseded on other grounds as recognized in hoechst celanese corp. v. bp chems ltd. 78_f.3d_1575 1578 fed.cir.1996
good faith may normally be shown by obtaining the advice of legal counsel as to infringement or patent validity
see id.at 828
if counsels opinion is found to be incompetent however a fact_finder may discount its usefulness in determining a partys good_faith
see id.at 828-29 ; see also goodwall_constr co. v. beers constr co. 991_f.2d_751 758 fed.cir.1993 holding that a jury could have concluded that the infringing party concealed incriminating evidence from its opinion counsel

here ld cites to several pieces of evidence the jury may have relied on to find copying
one of the most persuasive pieces of evidence appears to be vaughans competing bid on the augusta_tank
though the engineering_drawings are virtually duplicates of lds job proposal that is not the most persuasive evidence that the jury may have relied upon to infer copying
ld presented evidence that vaughan used behnke a former ld employee with intimate knowledge of the augusta_tank and lds jetmix_system to establish a nozzle_angle of its own rotamix system
while vaughan discounts this evidence because it used a different nozzle height and a dual-nozzle_design instead of the single-nozzle_design ld proposed to augusta the jury could reasonably infer that vaughan was deliberately trying to create the same flow pattern as lds jetmix_system in violation of the414_patent
there is no limitation in the414_patent requiring single-nozzle systems
in fact the414_patent contemplates the use of` various flow devices of a system [ that ] may be installed at differing heights if desired.. and may be combined in pairs'
col._8,_ll._35-44
thus vaughans argument that the jury could not find *1226 copying because its augusta proposal made insubstantial changes to a patented_invention does not overcome the substantial_evidence to the contrary
furthermore the vaughan_engineering_manual includes a drawing similar in detail to the augusta_tank layout a fact the jurors could have used to infer copying

though vaughan relies heavily on its opinion of counsel ld presented flaws in that opinions factual basis
ld explains that patent_counsel was not given the complete cfd_analysis because he was not provided with the vertical_vector_plots of fluid_flow
patent counsel was advised that the vertical_plots did not show anything of significance
in fact the report on the merced and generic 50-foot tanks explained that the vertical_plots indicated vertical flow and secondary flow vortices
the jury could use such a concealment of evidence from the attorney to discount the opinion
see goodwall_constr. 991 f.2d at 758
although vaughan asserts that the district_courts enhancement of damages should be reversed the primary basis for this position is that the jurys finding of willfulness should be reversed an argument we have already rejected
vaughans only other argument is that litigation misconduct did not justify enhancement but that argument was made only in a footnote in the opening brief and therefore was not sufficiently preserved
smithkline beecham corp. v. apotex corp. 439_f.3d_1312 1320 fed.cir.2006

e. inequitable conduct
finally vaughan argues that the district_court improperly granted lds jmol for its inequitable_conduct claim
vaughan maintains that the court committed clear_error by finding that the plymouth and indiana_packers_installations were not prior_art that should have been disclosed to the patent examiner

patent applicants are required to prosecute patents` with candor good_faith and honesty'
see bristol-myers_squibb_co. 326 f.3d at 1233 citation omitted
`` a breach of this duty can take several formsaffirmative misrepresentation of a material_fact failure to disclose material_information or submission of false material_information
further a breach of this duty when coupled with an intent to deceive or mislead the pto constitutes inequitable_conduct which when proven renders the patent unenforceable'
id
( citations omitted
in order to establish inequitable_conduct vaughan must present clear and convincing_evidence that the inventors` failed to disclose material_information with an intent to mislead the pto'
id.at 1233-34

the district_court found that crumps testimony regarding the process of invention was credible and believed that the plymouth and indiana_packers_installations were not material_information because they were` very different configurations' from the claimed invention and were part of an` evolving process of experimentation by the inventors'
the court also found that even if the previous installations had been material crumps testimony that he did not intend to deceive the patent office was credible and his extensive prior_art disclosures during prosecution strongly suggested good_faith

our inquiry into materiality is an objective one
`` materiality is not limited to prior_art but embraces any information that a reasonable_examiner would be substantially likely to consider important in deciding whether to allow an application to issue as a patent'
bristol-myers_squibb_co. 326 f.3d at 1234 citation omitted
here the district_court erred in its analysis of materiality
the court focused on whether the prior_installations actually embody the invention when the correct analysis asks whether a reasonable_examiner *1227 would find it important
in this case the inventors explain how they developed the invention and their use of the plymouth and indiana_packers_tanks to do so
they certainly used the previous tanks to assist in developing the invention and the tanks were part of a sale not an experiment
a reasonable patent examiner would find such information important to his consideration of the patent_application

however vaughan fails to establish that the inventors had the requisite intent to deceive
intent is a subjective inquiry into whether the inventor knew the information was material and chose not to disclose it
see id.at 1239
here vaughan asks us to reweigh the credibility of the evidence and testimony something we can not do
see lnp eng g plastics inc. v. miller waste mills inc. 275_f.3d_1347 1361 fed.cir.2001
the trial court relied on the evidence that crump did not believe the prior_installations were necessary disclosures because they were not embodiments of the invention and were similar to other disclosures
furthermore crump testified that he did inform the examiner of the prior tanks
we see no reversible_error in the district_courts analysis of intent
thus the courts finding of no inequitable_conduct was not clearly erroneous

iii
conclusion
in this appeal vaughan asks us to review the district_courts denial of their jmol_motion for non-infringement invalidity no willful_infringement and unenforceability due to inequitable_conduct
for the reasons stated in this opinion we find no reversible_error
accordingly we affirm

affirmed

the meaning of torodial is similar if not identical to helical_flow for our purposes
2
vaughan also argues that the district_court improperly excluded expert_testimony regarding enablement
the district_court excluded the expert opinion evidence as irrelevant because it was based on an impermissible claim_construction and relied heavily on figure 6 of the patent_specification that shows perfect helical_flow instead of substantial_helical_flow
furthermore the court found that the evidence could prejudice and confuse the jury
since the enablement inquiry necessarily depends on an interpretation of the claims we conclude that the district_court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the experts testimony pertaining to enablement
