s-00-1252 wbs_ggh sept. 9 & oct._23,_2002
because chiron did not adequately disclose or support the subject_matter of its ¡¬561_patent in its 1984 1985 or 1986 applications this court affirms the district_courts denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law jmol and motion for a new_trial

i
the ¡¬561_patent claims particular monoclonal_antibodies
specifically independent_claim 19 states:1` a monoclonal_antibody that binds to human_c-erbb-2_antigen'

according to modern understanding a monoclonal_antibody is a composition with a homogeneous_antibody_population
an antibody is a protein generated by the immune_system that is capable of recognizing and binding to a specific_antigen
described in terms of its structure an antibody is a y-shaped protein consisting of four amino acid chains two heavy and two light
in a simplified model sufficient for this appeal each antibody has primarily two regions a variable_region and a constant_region
the variable_region located on the ends of the arms of the y binds to and interacts with the target_antigen
this variable_region includes a complementary determining region cdr that recognizes and binds to a specific binding site on a particular antigen
the constant_region located on the tail of the y is recognized by and interacts with the immune_system

a target_antigen generally has numerous binding sites also called epitopes recognized by cdrs on multiple antibodies
each antibody that specifically binds to a different epitope has a different structure
thus one antigen may have more than one corresponding antibody
in this case claim 19 of the ¡¬ 561 patent reads on monoclonal_antibodies that bind to human_c-erbb-2_antigen also named her2 -an antigen associated with breast_cancer cells

there are various methods of producing monoclonal_antibodies
one method uses hybridoma technology which refers to a cloned cell line that produces a single type of antibody
the hybridoma_method uses the cells of various species including mice hamsters rats and humans
murine antibodies-derived from mouse cells-are particularly important for this invention

another method uses genetic engineering including recombinant dna techniques
monoclonal antibodies made from these techniques include among others chimeric_antibodies and humanized_antibodies
a chimeric_antibody combines dna encoding regions from more than one type of species
for example a chimeric_antibody may derive the variable_region from a mouse and the constant_region from a human
a humanized_antibody comes predominantly from a human even though it contains nonhuman_portions
like a chimeric_antibody a humanized_antibody may contain a completely human_constant_region
but unlike a chimeric_antibody the variable_region may be partially derived from a human
the nonhuman *1251 synthetic portions of a humanized_antibody often come from cdrs in murine_antibodies
in any event these regions are crucial to allow the antibody to recognize and bind to a specific_antigen

as noted murine_antibodies play an important role in these technologies
while useful for diagnostics and short-term therapies murine_antibodies can not be administered to people long-term without increasing the risk of a deleterious immunogenic response
this response called human anti-mouse antibody hama occurs when a human immune_system recognizes the murine_antibody as foreign and attacks it
a hama_response can cause toxic shock or even death

chimeric and humanized_antibodies reduce the likelihood of a hama_response by minimizing the nonhuman_portions of administered antibodies
furthermore chimeric and humanized_antibodies have the additional benefit of activating secondary human immune responses such as antibody dependent cellular cytoxicity

in the early 1980s scientists at chirons predecessor corporation cetus corp. collectively chiron began investigating monoclonal_antibodies that target human_breast_cancer_antigens
as noted above the antigen that facilitates diagnosis and treatment of breast_cancer was eventually named her2
this investigational work led to a series of patent applications
the inventors filed their first_application on february 8 1984
within a year on january 11 1985 they filed a continuation-in-part cip application claiming priority based on that first 1984 application
the inventors filed another cip application on may_21,_1986
eventually the application that led to the ¡¬ 561 patent was filed as another cip on june_7,_1995
this appeal focuses on the ¡¬561_patents claims to priority based on the applications filed in 1984 1985 and 1986

the 1984 application discloses one monoclonal_antibody 454c11 that binds to her2
the 454c11 is a murine_antibody produced by the hybridoma_method
while the application discloses the deposit of the hybridoma that produced the monoclonal_antibody the application does not identify the structure function or molecular_weight of the antigen
because the first_publication that disclosed chimeric_antibody_technology did not appear until four months after this filing it is not surprising that the 1984 application does not disclose any chimeric_antibodies
similarly the first_publication to disclose humanized_antibodies appeared in may 1986
thus for good reason this 1984 application also does not mention any humanized_antibodies

the 1985 application discloses six additional monoclonal_antibodies that bind to her2 all of which are murine_antibodies
the disclosure also refers to the deposit of an additional hybridoma for one of these monoclonal_antibodies 520c9
while the application provides an approximate antigen molecular_weight of 210 kilodaltons,2 the application does not describe the identity structure or function of the antigen
the application does however note that six of the seven antibodies likely bind to the same epitope
by the time of this application chimeric_antibody_technology was known in this art_field
although the application does not specifically disclose chimeric or humanized_antibodies it adds the following disclosure

as used herein the term` monoclonal_antibody' means an antibody_composition having a homogeneous_antibody_population
it is not intended to be limited as regards the source of the *1252 antibody or the manner in which it is made
the 1986 application discloses six additional murine_antibodies that bind to her2 and the deposit for three additional hybridomas
thus this application discloses a total of thirteen murine_antibodies and deposits for five of their corresponding hybridomas including those corresponding to 454cbig_token__11_and_520__big_token c9
the application discloses that these antibodies likely bind to at least three different epitopes on her2
although still not identifying the antigen by name the application discloses that its molecular_weight is approximately 200 kilodaltons
although the 1986 application makes no specific mention of chimeric or humanized_antibodies it quotes again the statement that the term monoclonal_antibody` is not intended to be limited as regards the source of the antibody or the manner in which it is made'

when the ¡¬561_patent issued chiron sued genentech over sales of herceptin the_r a humanized_antibody useful for the long-term treatment of breast_cancer
herceptin binds to the her2_antigen and thus inhibits the growth of cancerous cells
because herceptin is a humanized_antibody it minimizes any hama_response in patients

before trial the district_court broadly construed the claims of the ¡¬561_patent to embrace chimeric and humanized_antibodies in addition to the murine_antibodies that bind to her2
chiron_corp. v. genentech inc. 266_f.supp.2d_1172_(e.d.cal.2002)
accordingly the district_court subsequently granted chirons motion for partial summary judgment of infringement

also before trial the parties stipulated that the ¡¬561_patent would be invalid under ¡± 102 based on intervening prior_art if the patent were not entitled to claim priority to the filing_date of any one of the 1984 1985 and 1986 applications
thus the thirteen-day jury trial adjudicated only whether any of the priority_applications satisfy the written description and enablement_requirements of 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 first_paragraph
specifically the trial determined whether the 1980s applications adequately disclosed and thus supported the claim to chimeric and humanized_antibodies claimed in the ¡¬561_patent with its filing_date in 1995
the jury determined that genentech proved by clear and convincing_evidence that none of the applications satisfy both the written description and the enablement_requirement for the subject_matter in the ¡¬ 561 patents claims
the verdict form however did not require the jury to specify the particular requirement of ¡± 112 left unfulfilled by each disclosure of the priority_applications
after trial the district_court denied chirons motions for jmol and a new_trial

chiron appeals the denial of its post-trial motions and genentech conditionally` cross-appeals' the district_courts claim_construction
although styled as a cross-appeal this court treats this claim_construction issue as an alternative ground for affirming the judgment
a cross-appeal is only proper if` a party seeks to enlarge its own rights under the judgment or to lessen the rights of its adversary under the judgment'
bailey v. dart container corp. of mich. 292_f.3d_1360 1362 fed.cir.2002
this court has jurisdiction under 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295

ii
a trial_court should grant a motion for jmol if substantial_evidence does not support the jurys factual_findings presumed or express or if those factual_findings can not support the legal conclusions implied from the jurys verdict
kearns v. *1253 chrysler corp. 32_f.3d_1541 1547-48 fed.cir.1994
this court reviews a district_courts denial of a jmol motion without deference
sextant avionique s.a. v. analog devices inc. 172_f.3d_817 824 fed.cir.1999

section 120 of title 35 provides` an application for patent for an invention disclosed in the manner provided by the first_paragraph of section 112 of this title in an application previously filed in the united_states.. shall have the same effect as to such invention as though filed on the date of the prior_application'
accordingly the ¡¬561_patent may only claim priority to an earlier_application if the earlier_application fulfills the requirements of ¡± 112 first_paragraph
in turn that paragraph requires in part that the application` shall contain a written description of the invention and of the manner and process of making and using it in such full clear concise and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains or with which it is most nearly connected to make and use the same'
35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
1

this court has interpreted this passage as setting forth two requirements written description and enablement
amgen inc. v. hoechst marion roussel inc. 314_f.3d_1313 1330 fed.cir.2003
as explained further below this court affirms because neither the 1985 nor the 1986 application enables the claims of the ¡¬561_patent
the 1984 application does not support the new_matter added to the ¡¬561_patent and thus does not satisfy the written description_requirement

whether the earlier_applications enable the claims of the ¡¬561_patent is a question of law based on underlying facts
in re wands 858_f.2d_731 735 fed.cir.1988
this court reviews the underlying factual_findings for clear error and the legal component of enablement without deference
plant_genetic_sys_.
n.v. v. dekalb_genetics_corp. 315_f.3d_1335 1339 fed.cir.2003
because the ¡¬561_patent is presumed valid clear and convincing_evidence must support a conclusion of invalidity
see 35 u.s.c.¡± 282 ; hybritech inc. v. monoclonal antibodies inc. 802_f.2d_1367 1375 fed.cir.1986

the applications in this case satisfy the enablement_requirement only if one skilled in the art after reading their disclosures could practice the invention claimed in the ¡¬561_patent without undue_experimentation
wands 858 f.2d at 736-37
`` but the question of undue_experimentation is a matter of degree
the fact that some experimentation is necessary does not preclude enablement ; what is required is that the amount of experimentationmust not be unduly extensive
`` ppg indus. inc. v. guardian indus. corp. 75_f.3d_1558 1564 fed.cir.1996 quoting atlas powder co. v. e.i
du pont de nemours & co. 750_f.2d_1569 1576 fed.cir.1984

moreover the prior_application must enable one of ordinary_skill in the art to practice` the full_scope of the claimed invention'
in re wright 999_f.2d_1557 1561 fed.cir.1993
clarifying this principle this court has explained` that is not to say that the specification itself must necessarily describe how to make and use every possible variant of the claimed invention for the artisans knowledge of the prior_art and routine experimentation can often fill gaps interpolate between embodiments and perhaps even extrapolate beyond the disclosed embodiments depending upon the predictability of the art'
ak steel corp. v. sollac 344_f.3d_1234 1244 fed.cir.2003
thus` [ t ] he enabling disclosure of the specification [ must ] be commensurate in scope with the claim under consideration'
in re hyatt 708_f.2d_712 714 fed.cir.1983

*1254 whether the earlier_applications enable the claims of the ¡¬ 561 patent is determined as of the filing_date of each application
see plant_genetic sys. 315 f.3d at 1339
as noted above a patent disclosure need not enable information within the knowledge of an ordinarily skilled artisan
thus a patentee preferably omits from the disclosure any routine_technology that is well known at the time of application
see hybritech 802 f.2d at 1384
at the other end of the knowledge continuum a patent document can not enable technology that arises after the date of application
the law does not expect an applicant to disclose knowledge invented or developed after the filing_date
such disclosure would be impossible
see in re hogan 559_f.2d_595 605-06 ccpa 1977
nascent technology however must be enabled with a` specific and useful_teaching'
genentech inc. v. novo nordisk a/s 108_f.3d_1361 1368 fed.cir.1997
the law requires an enabling disclosure for nascent_technology because a person of ordinary_skill in the art has little or no knowledge independent from the patentees instruction
thus the publics end of the bargain struck by the patent system is a full enabling disclosure of the claimed technology
see e.g. j.e.m
ag supply inc. v. pioneer hi-bred int l inc. 534_u.s._124 142 122_s.ct._593 604 151_l.ed.2d_508_(2001)

`` because a patent specification must enable the full_scope of a claimed invention an enablement inquiry typically begins with a construction of the claims'
ak steel 344 f.3d at 1241 citation omitted
in this case neither party challenges the district_courts claim_construction in the first instance
as a precaution genentech posits a` cross-appeal' on claim_construction in the event this court reverses the denials of chirons post-trial motions
because genentechs arguments regarding claim_construction are alternative grounds for affirming the verdict bailey 292_f.3d_1360 this court proceeds on the premise that the claim_construction is correct
the district_courts claim_construction reads the claims of the ¡¬561_patent to embrace not only murine_antibodies but also chimeric and humanized_antibodies that bind to her2

at the outset this court focuses primarily on chimeric_antibodies
if the applications in this case do not enable or provide new_matter support for chimeric_antibodies this court need not proceed to examine humanized_antibodies
the trial record shows that genetically engineered antibodies specifically chimeric_antibodies first appeared as a successful technology in the literature of this art_field in may 1984 four months after the february filing_date of the first_application
because the first_publication documenting the successful creation of chimeric_antibodies occurred after the filing of the 1984 application this sequence of events shows that this new_technology arose after the filing_date and thus was by definition outside the bounds of the enablement_requirement
see hogan 559 f.2d at 605-06

the district_court in this case attempted to justify the jurys enablement verdict on the basis that the 1984 applicants might have known about chimeric_antibodies before the initial_publication on that subject
the trial_court cited speculative testimony in the trial about the hypothetical possibility that information may leak out in advance of an initial_publication on an important academic topic
at no point did the record show that chiron_scientists actually knew of chimeric_antibodies before their filing only that it was hypothetically possible for them to have acquired some advance knowledge
even if the record shows that scientists routinely discuss their work with others in the same art_field before publication ethics would suggest impropriety in publishing that information *1255 in advance of the actual originator of the ideas
in any event as noted the enablement_requirement does not extend to technology that arises after the time of filing
plant_genetic sys. 315 f.3d at 1340-41
in sum the district_court erred to the extent that it attempted to create an obligation for chiron_scientists to enable nonexistent technology in the 1984 filing

in the context of the 1984 application the trial_court and this court need not rely on enablement to support the jurys verdict
the jury may have found that the 1984 application does not provide any support for the new_matter chimeric_antibodies claimed in the ¡¬561_patent
because chimeric_antibody_technology did not even exist at the time of the 1984 filing the record conclusively supports that the chiron_scientists did not possess and disclose this technology in the february 1984 filing
see union oil co. of cal
v. atl
richfield co. 208_f.3d_989 998 fed.cir.2000 a jury determined` that as of the filing_date the inventor conveyed with reasonable clarity to those of skill in the art that he was in possession of the subject_matter of the claims`
thus the ¡¬561_patent can not claim priority based on the 1984 application because it fails to comply with the written description_requirement

the written description_requirement prevents applicants from using the amendment process to update their disclosures claims or specifications during their pendency before the patent office
otherwise applicants could add new_matter to their disclosures and date them back to their original filing_date thus defeating an accurate accounting of the priority of invention
see 35_u.s.c._132
priority is always a vital issue in patent prosecution procedures-often determining entitlement to an invention
in 1967 this courts predecessor began to enforce priority as a component of the 35_u.s.c._112 first_paragraph written description_requirement
in re ruschig 54_c.c.p.a._1551 379_f.2d_990_(1967)
in the context of a new claim added` [ a ] bout a year after the present application was filed' the ruschig court sought to determine` whether [ the new ] claim 13 is supported by the disclosure of appellants application'
id.at 991
as later explained` [ t ] he function of the description_requirement is to ensure that the inventor had possession as of the filing_date of the application relied on of the specific subject_matter later claimed by him'
in re wertheim 541_f.2d_257 262 ccpa 1976
in this case the chiron_scientists by definition could not have possession of and disclose the subject_matter of chimeric_antibodies that did not even exist at the time of the 1984 application
thus axiomatically chiron can not satisfy the written description_requirement for the new_matter appearing in the 561 patent namely chimeric_antibodies
see e.g. in re kaslow 707_f.2d_1366 1375 fed.cir.1983` the test for determining compliance with the written description_requirement is whether the disclosure of the application as originally filed reasonably conveys to the artisan that the inventor had possession at that time of the later claimed subject_matter rather than the presence or absence of literal support in the specification for the claim language'
( citation omitted

turning next to the 1985_and_1986 applications this court examines compliance with the enablement_requirement
for these applications the jury was entitled to determine as a matter of fact that chimeric_antibodies were not future_technology but were nascent_technology requiring a` specific and useful_teaching'
genentech 108 f.3d at 1368
this question in turn depends on evidence that undue_experimentation would be required to make and use the chimeric_antibodies claimed by the ¡¬561_patent
of course *1256 undue_experimentation` is not a single simple factual determination but rather is a conclusion reached by weighing many factual considerations'
wands 858 f.2d at 737
these factual considerations include` 1 the quantity of experimentation necessary 2 the amount of direction or guidance presented 3 the presence or absence of working examples 4 the nature of the invention 5 the state of the prior_art 6 the relative skill of those in the art 7 the predictability or unpredictability of the art and 8 the breadth of the claims'
id

evidence presented to the jury showed that creation of genetically engineered antibodies such as chimeric_antibodies required significant experimentation in 1985_and_1986 because those antibodies were unpredictable at that early stage of development
the record also shows that only a few_laboratories contained the necessary equipment to make these new antibodies-another indication of the excessive experimentation necessary to make and use that technology at that time
the 1985_and_1986 applications provide no disclosure of either how to make and use chimeric_antibodies or working examples of chimeric_antibodies within the scope of the ¡¬561_patents claims

moreover as mentioned above` [ t ] he enabling disclosure of the specification [ must ] be commensurate in scope with the claim under consideration'
hyatt 708 f.2d at 714
here the scope of the claim includes not only murine but also chimeric_antibodies
while chirons applications certainly enable murine_antibodies they do not enable chimeric_antibodies
although an aspect of the claimed invention included the binding of an antibody to a breast_cancer antigen chirons disclosure fell short of providing a` specific and useful_teaching' genentech 108 f.3d at 1368 of all antibodies within the scope of the claim

by the filing_date of the 1986 application chiron contends that chimeric_antibodies were so well known that they had become routine_technology
chiron particularly highlights a number of publications before the 1986 application that disclosed methods of making chimeric_antibodies
accordingly chiron argues that the 1986 application need not specifically enable chimeric_antibodies because technicians of ordinary_skill in this art could make and use them by that time without undue_experimentation
substantial evidence however supports the jurys implicit finding that the technology was still nascent at the time of the 1986 application as well as of course at the time of the 1985 application and thus would have still required undue_experimentation

in particular genentechs expert dr._french testified that making chimeric_antibodies was not routine_technology in 1985_or_1986
dr._french also testified that by 1986 only a few_laboratories had the capacity and expertise necessary to make genetically engineered antibodies
dr. larrick another one of genentechs experts testified that polymerase chain reaction pcr a technique that facilitated the manufacture of genetically engineered antibodies including chimeric_antibodies did not become widespread until sometime between 1986_and_1988
although pcr is not necessary to make chimeric_antibodies pcr diminishes the difficulties associated with manufacturing genetically engineered antibodies
furthermore by 1989 an article authored by a pioneer in the field described techniques of chimeric_antibodies as` obviously those of a very young and very ambitious field'
sherie l. morrison genetically engineered chimeric antibodies 24 hosp
practice no._10 65 75 oct._15,_1989
the article further noted` we are all new to the game'
thus substantial_evidence supports the finding that chimeric_antibodies were still a nascent_technology at the time the 1985 and *1257 1986 applications were filed
accordingly the record amply supports the jurys conclusion that the 1985_and_1986 applications do not enable the claims of the ¡¬561_patent without undue_experimentation

while agreeing with the conclusion that the ¡¬561_patent may not claim priority to the 1984 application the concurrence reads hogan and plant_genetic as allowing an inquiry into whether an application must enable future_technology
this court can not avoid the precedent of hogan which is binding unless overruled en banc by virtue of the more recent plant_genetic
see allergan inc. v. alcon labs. inc. 324_f.3d_1322 1332-34 fed.cir.2003
but even if earlier precedent could be disregarded this court does not read plant_genetic to hold that an application must enable unknown future_technology
plant_genetic states we do not read hogan as allowing an inventor to claim what was specifically desired but difficult to obtain at the time the application was filed unless the patent discloses how to make and use it
in hogan amorphous_propylene on the record before the court was not known or in existence when the application was filed
in the present_case however monocots existed in 1987 and stably-transformed monocot_cells were highly desirable
pgs indeed asserts that monocot_cells were already being stably transformed
thus monocots and stably transformed monocot_cells were not an unknown concept that came into existence only after 1987
but stably transformed monocot_cells were difficult to produce and the ¡¬236_patent gave no instruction how
315 f.3d at 1340 emphasis added
thus plant_genetic distinguishes hogan because stably transformed monocots were nascent_technology when the application was filed unlike the unknown and nonexistent amorphous_propylene in the prior case
in the present_case chimeric_antibodies like the amorphous_propylene in hogan did not even appear for the first time until several months after the 1984 application

because the ¡¬561_patent is invalid for the reasons noted above this court need not reach the question of claim_construction
this case poses a particular challenge for accurate assessment of the meaning of the claim terms
in this case the meaning of` monoclonal_antibody' may not have been stagnant between the earlier_applications and the ¡¬561_patent
the ordinary usage of` monoclonal_antibody' in the early 1980s was narrow
for example one treatise defines` monoclonal_antibody' in these narrow terms` antibody secreted by a hybridoma clone
because each such clone is derived from a single b cell all of the antibody molecules it makes are identical'
bruce alberts et al. molecular_biology of the cell g-15 3d ed.1994 ; accord bruce alberts et al. molecular_biology of the cell 182-84 1983
indeed another textbook expressly equated` monoclonal_antibody' with` hybridoma antibody'
leroy e. hood et al. immunology 20 1984
thus the term` monoclonal_antibody' in 1984 apparently referred to antibodies made with hybridoma and was not broad enough to encompass chimeric_antibodies
see alan munro uses of chimaeric antibodies 312_nature_597_(1984) differentiating monoclonal_antibodies from chimeric_antibodies
accordingly when the earliest priority application was filed` monoclonal_antibody' apparently referred only to a hybridoma-derived antibody
the 1984 application did not expressly redefine the term.3

*1258 the ¡¬561_patent however included a definition for` monoclonal_antibody' the term` antibody' encompasses polyclonal and monoclonal_antibody preparations as well as preparations including hybrid antibodies altered antibodies chimeric_antibodies and [ sic ] humanized_antibodies
as used herein the term` monoclonal_antibody' refers to an antibody_composition having a homogeneous_antibody_population
the term is not limited regarding the species or source of the antibody nor is it intended to be limited by the manner in which it is made
the term encompasses whole immunoglobulins
'561_patent col._8,_ll._36-45
thus the ¡¬561_patent defined` monoclonal_antibody' to include chimeric and humanized_antibodies
still only a portion of this updated meaning of` monoclonal_antibody' can claim priority to the earliest_application
if required to engage in claim_construction therefore this court would face a dilemma either construe the term according to the meaning of the earliest_application but contrary to the explicit_definition in the ¡¬561_patent or construe the term according to the explicit_definition in the ¡¬561_patent but broader than the disclosure of the earliest_application
again the latter alternative would run afoul of the prohibition against importing new_matter into later patent documents
as noted however the record amply supports the jurys verdict of invalidity without reaching this complex claim_construction question

iii
a trial_court should grant a motion for a new_trial if 1 the jury_instructions were erroneous or inadequate 2 the court made incorrect and prejudicial admissibility rulings or 3 the verdict is contrary to the great weight of the evidence
murphy v. long beach 914_f.2d_183 186 9th cir.1990 ; chalmers v. city of los_angeles 762_f.2d_753 761 9th cir.1985
chiron asserts that it is entitled to a new_trial based on the first and second avenues
this court reviews the denial of a new_trial_motion after a jury_verdict for an abuse of discretion
advanced cardiovascular sys. inc. v. medtronic inc. 265_f.3d_1294 1308 fed.cir.2001 ; de saracho v. custom food mach. inc. 206_f.3d_874 880 9th cir.2000

with respect to the jury_instructions chiron assigns error to four separate rulings
this court reviews jury_instructions in their entirety and` only orders a new_trial when errors in the instructions as a whole clearly misled the jury'
delta-x corp. v. baker hughes prod
tools inc. 984_f.2d_410 415 fed.cir.1993
furthermore chiron` must show both fatal flaws in the jury_instructions and a request for alternative instructions which could have corrected the flaws'
id

first chiron argues that the district_court erred by instructing the jury on genentechs burden of proof without also adding an instruction on the presumption of the ¡¬561_patents validity
this court disagrees because the presumption of validity and heightened burden of proving invalidity` are static and in reality different expressions of the same thing-a single hurdle to be cleared'
am
hoist & derrick co. v. sowa & sons inc. 725_f.2d_1350 1360 fed.cir.1984 ; see also moba b.v. v. diamond automation inc. 325_f.3d_1306 1319 fed.cir.2003
moreover this court has explained` [ t ] he presumption is one of law not fact and does not *1259 constituteevidence to be weighed against the challengers evidence'
avia group int l inc. v. l.a. gear cal. inc. 853_f.2d_1557 1562 fed.cir.1988
therefore the district_court did not err in declining to include a jury instruction on the presumption of validity because the jury applied the correct` clear and convincing_evidence' standard

second chiron argues that the district_court erred by instructing the jury on the law of written description
in particular chiron complains that three instructions-the first and third of which were not grouped with the written description instructions-collectively may have directed the jury to find the ¡¬561_patent invalid if the earlier_applications did not describe every embodiment known to skilled artisans as of the filing_dates
the first instruction set forth the construction of` monoclonal_antibody'
the second_instruction stated` an application satisfies the written description_requirement if persons of ordinary_skill in the art at the time the application was filed would recognize from the application that the inventor actually invented the full_scope of the invention as finally claimed in the patent'
the third instruction set forth that the jury would` determine whether the forms referred to in the definition ofmonoclonal_antibody were or were not known in the art at the time the 1984 1985 and 1986 applications were filed'
this court rejects chirons challenge because the district_court instructed the jury on the proper standard for the written description_requirement in the second_instruction
even though the second_instruction did not echo the precise language of this courts cases this court has stated that` compliance with ¡± 112 has always required sufficient information in the original disclosure to show that the inventor possessed the invention at the time of the original filing'
moba 325 f.3d at 1320
the district_courts instruction embodies the principle of this courts statement in moba
the district_court need not use identical language to this courts opinions in its instructions

separately chiron challenges another instruction on written description which the district_court based on gentry gallery inc. v. berkline corp. 134_f.3d_1473_(fed.cir.1998) and cooper cameron corp. v. kvaerner oilfield products inc. 291_f.3d_1317_(fed.cir.2002)
in particular the court instructed the jury one way genentech can meet its burden of proving that an earlier_application fails to satisfy the written description_requirement is to show by clear and convincing_evidence that the entirety of the specification of an earlier_application would clearly indicate to persons of ordinary_skill in the art that the invention described in that application is of a much narrower_scope than the invention ultimately claimed in the ¡¬561_patent
in considering this issue the particular question you must decide is whether the 1984 1985_or_1986 applications clearly indicate to a person of ordinary_skill in the art that the invention described is.. narrower in scope than the claims of the ¡¬561_patent at issue
chiron argues that this instruction invited the jury to apply a test that does not correspond to this courts written description law
this court again rejects chirons argument
once again though using different words the district_courts instruction captures the essence of the written description doctrine that a patent can not claim priority to earlier_applications if it includes new_matter not present in those earlier disclosures
vas-cath inc. v. mahurkar 935_f.2d_1555 1563-64 fed.cir.1991
therefore this court finds no error in the jury_instructions on written description

*1260 third chiron argues that the district_court erred by instructing the jury on the law of enablement
in particular chiron complains that the district_court erred in rejecting the following two proposed instructions the patent application need only enable what it is claimed
features or characteristics that are not claimed need not be enabled
in this case the novel aspect of the invention claimed in the ¡¬561_patent concerns monoclonal_antibodies capable of binding to a specific breast_cancer antigen
to meet the enablement_requirement an application need not enable every way of making the claimed invention
an application meets the enablement_requirement if it enables even one way of making the claimed invention

this court rejects the notion that the district_court erred by declining to include these instructions
the district_court provided a succinct and correct summary of the law of enablement that chiron does not challenge
a trial_court need not further instruct the jury on what enablement does not require
cf
novo nordisk a/s v. becton dickinson & co. 304_f.3d_1216 1219-20 fed.cir.2002 affirming a district_courts refusal to include an instruction that` obvious to try' is not a correct obviousness standard

lastly chiron argues that the district_court erred by instructing the jury that the validity of the dependent_claims stands or falls with the validity of the independent_claims
chiron correctly cites the general_rule that` a party challenging the validity of a claim absent a pretrial agreement or stipulation must submit evidence supporting a conclusion of invalidity of each claim the challenger seeks to destroy'
shelcore inc. v. durham indus. inc. 745_f.2d_621 625 fed.cir.1984 emphasis in original
the district_court clearly recognized and understood that general_rule
the district_court however also recognized that in this case the validity challenges to the independent_claims coincided with the validity challenges to the dependent_claims ; the sameness of the inquiries permitted the treatment of all claims at once
cf
nat l recovery techs. inc. v. magnetic separation sys. inc. 166_f.3d_1190 1198 fed.cir.1999 holding that under the facts of that case the dependent_claims were invalid solely because their independent_claim was invalid
moreover the district_courts instruction eliminated the potential for an inconsistent verdict ; this court commends such foresight
this court therefore holds that the district_court did not err in instructing the jury particularly when those instructions are examined as a whole and read in context

with respect to the prejudicial evidence chiron assigns error to three rulings
this court will reverse the district_courts denial of a new_trial_motion based on evidentiary rulings only if chiron establishes both that the rulings were an abuse of discretion and that it suffered substantial prejudice
ruvalcaba v. los_angeles 64_f.3d_1323 1328 9th cir.1995 ; advanced cardiovascular 265 f.3d at 1308 ; united_states v. 99.66 acres of land 970_f.2d_651 658 9th cir.1992

first chiron argues that the district_court erred in admitting evidence regarding the accused drug product herceptin and regarding the absence of a commercial_embodiment by chiron
this court rejects chirons argument because these facts related to genentechs defenses
for example post-1986 evidence including evidence regarding herceptin may show what was known about making and using humanized_antibodies in 1986
the absence of a commercial_embodiment by chiron also bears on whether chimeric or humanized_antibodies within the scope *1261 of the claims of the ¡¬561_patent were routine_technology
accordingly that evidence is relevant to enablement
moreover the district_court issued a limiting instruction on the evidence relating to herceptin which stated that the jury may consider it helpful in deciding whether the 1986 application meets the enablement and written description_requirements
chiron also takes issue with genentechs mention of this evidence in its closing_argument
see union carbide chems
& plastics tech corp. v. shell oil co. 308_f.3d_1167 1183-84 fed.cir.2002
but chiron points to no evidence of jury prejudice as a result of the identified statements which were buried in a seventy-seven page transcript of genentechs closing_argument
see hemmings v. tidymans inc. 285_f.3d_1174 1194 9th cir.2002 explaining that an isolated comment during sixty-six page closing_argument did not warrant a new_trial
accordingly this court declines to assign reversible error in denying a new_trial based on this evidence

second chiron argues that the district_court erred in admitting evidence relating to unclaimed features such as binding to particular epitopes or specific therapeutic effects
chiron particularly objects to evidence regarding the extent of the hama_response caused by murine_antibodies
this court rejects chirons argument because the district_court recognized that testimony regarding the hama_response and epitope binding was relevant to the claimed features of the monoclonal_antibodies
unless the claim_construction is incorrect which chiron does not assert this testimony is relevant

finally chiron argues that the district_court erred in excluding previously admitted documents from the prosecution of a related application assigned to genentech the drebin/greene_application
this court rejects chirons argument
chiron first proffered this evidence which related to the ¡¬561_patents priority date before declaration of an interference between the ¡¬561_patent and the drebin/greene_application
when the board of patent_appeals and interferences issued a notice of interference the district_court decided that it would strike prior evidence introduced by chiron and informed chiron that it would be` inclined' to grant a mistrial
but when the court directly asked chiron whether it was making a motion for a mistrial chiron expressly declined to do so
accordingly the district_court did not err in declining chirons post-trial motion for a new_trial based on chirons introduction of evidence that was later stricken
thus none of these alleged errors warrants reversing the district_courts denial of a new_trial

iv
because substantial_evidence supported the jurys verdict that the ¡¬ 561 patent can not claim priority to any of the 1984 1985 and 1986 applications and because the district_court did not err in denying chirons motion for a new_trial this court affirms the judgment of the district_court

costs
each party shall bear its own costs

affirmed

bryson circuit_judge concurring
i concur in the judgment and in most of the courts opinion
with respect to the issue of priority i agree that because of a failure to satisfy the written description_requirement chiron is not entitled to priority back to 1984 for claims broadly construed to incorporate chimeric_antibodies
i disagree with the court however in holding that the district_court erred when it sustained the jurys verdict that the 1984 application did not enable the chimeric_antibodies *1262 claimed in the ¡¬561_patent
i would uphold the jurys verdict in that regard
in my view the jury permissibly concluded that the 1984 application like the 1985_and_1986 applications did not enable chimeric_antibodies

citing in re hogan 559_f.2d_595 ccpa 1977 the court holds that because it would be impossible for an applicant` to disclose knowledge invented or developed after the filing_date' of the application and because` the creation of chimeric_antibodies first occurred after the 1984 application' the timing of the application and the development of chimeric_antibody_technology` precluded any enablement analysis at all'
to be sure the enablement issue as to the 1984 application does not affect the outcome of this case because the court properly finds that the 1984 application failed to satisfy the written description_requirement and the patentee therefore was not entitled to priority as of the date of the 1984 application
nonetheless i do not agree that the enablement_requirement is inapplicable to the 1984 application

section 112 paragraph 1 of the patent act requires that an applicant who wishes to claim property rights in an invention must bear the burden of demonstrating enablement by showing the public how to make and use the invention
as applied to this case that principle would require the 1984 application to enable the invention claimed in that application
in my view in re hogan does not prevent us from reaching that conclusion

in hogan the pto rejected certain claims for lack of enablement after concluding that in light of post-application developments the claim scope was broad enough to read on certain embodiments that were not enabled by the application
the court of customs and patent_appeals reversed holding that it was enough that the application enabled the claims as construed in light of the state of the art at the time of filing
as the court explained` if appellants 1953 application provided sufficient enablement considering all available evidence whenever that evidence became available of the 1953 state of the art i.e. of the condition of knowledge about all art-related facts existing in 1953 then the fact of that enablement was established for all time and a later change in the state of the art can not change it'
559 f.2d at 605

i have no quarrel with the holding of hogan-that enablement must be judged in light of the state of the art at the time of the application
what must be guarded against in my view is to interpret hogan to hold that claims that are enabled by the original_application may be construed broadly enough to encompass technology that is not developed until later and was not enabled by the original_application
although there is language in hogan that could be read to support such a result this court has recently and properly in my view expressed reservations about reading hogan that broadly
see plant_genetic sys. n.v. v. dekalb_genetics_corp. 315_f.3d_1335 1340-41 fed.cir.2003

in plant_genetic_systems the court explained that hogan` simply held that one could not use a later-existing state of the art to invalidate a patent that was enabled for what it claimed at the time of filing'
315 f.3d at 1340
this makes perfect sense because as the hogan court explained` the use of a subsequently-existing improvement to show lack of enablement in an earlier-filed application on the basic invention would preclude issuance of a patent to the inventor of the thing improved and in the case of issued patents would invalidate all claims..
therein'
559 f.2d at 606
the court in hogan did not take the additional step of holding that the claims in that case should be construed to encompass the later-arising technology
*1263 in fact hogan explicitly declined to construe the claims at issue in that case although the court suggested in dictum that the scope of the claims might be broad enough to encompass the later-arising technology that was at issue
id
the court in plant_genetic_systems noted that the technology that was developed after the application was filed and thus was not enabled by the application fell within the scope of the claims if the claims were broadly construed but added that` the claims albeit with a narrower_scope might be nevertheless enabled in view of the state of the art then existing'
315 f.3d at 1341 emphasis added
plant_genetic_systems further cautioned against using` the dicta from hogan' to` expand the coverage of claims yet create a new lower standard of enablement'
id

i think the proper approach suggested in the concurring opinion in hogan and in plant_genetic_systems is to address cases of new_technology by construing claims where possible as they would have been understood by one of skill in the art at the time of the invention and not construing them to reach the as-yet-undeveloped technology that the applicant did not enable
that approach preserves the benefits of patent protection for the invention that the applicant has actually conceived and enabled without extending those benefits for an invention that the applicant may not have conceived and certainly has not enabled

in this case however the patentee is not seeking to preserve the validity of its claims by construing them in accordance with the state of the technology at the time of the invention
instead chiron is arguing that the 1984 application provides support for claims covering technology that was not in existence at that time
in that setting where the claims are accorded a scope that exceeds the scope of the enablement i would hold that the claims are not entitled to priority as of 1984 not only because of a failure to satisfy the written description_requirement but also because the 1984 application does not enable the asserted claims
i would therefore uphold the jurys verdict of lack of enablement not only as to the 1985_and_1986 applications but as to the 1984 application as well

the additional disclosure of the 1985_and_1986 applications which stated that` monoclonal_antibody'` is not intended to be limited as regards the source of the antibody or the manner in which it is made' may have had some broadening effect on the ordinary meaning of the term
this court however need not decide that issue
in any event the 1984 application did not exercise the lexicographers option of expressly defining the disputed term
