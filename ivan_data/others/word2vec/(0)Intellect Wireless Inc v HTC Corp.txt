opinion
moore circuit_judge
intellect_wireless inc. intellect appeals from the district_courts judgment that u.s. patent nos._7266,186 ¡¬186_patent and 7,310,416 ¡¬416_patent are unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct
we affirm

background
the technology at issue in this case involves wireless_transmission of caller_identification id information
the asserted_patents share the same specification which discloses providing caller_id_information from a message_center to a personal communication device such as a cell_phone via a wireless_network
¡¬186_patent at [ 57 ] ; id
col. 4. l. 66-col. 5_l._4
the specification also teaches displaying the caller_id_information on the cell_phones screen
id
col. 15_ll._20 -24
claim 1 of the ¡¬186_patent is representative a wireless_portable_communication_device for use by a message recipient for receiving a picture from a message_originator having a telephone_number comprising a receiver operably coupled to receive a message from a message_center over a wireless connection the message including a non-facsimile picture supplied by the message_originator and a caller_id automatically provided by a communications_network that identifies the telephone_number of the message_originator the message_originator sending the caller_id with the picture to the message_center ; a display ; and
a controller operably coupled to display the picture and caller_id on the display

i. materiality
the district_court held that htc proved the materiality_prong of inequitable_conduct
the court found that mr._henderson submitted to the pto a declaration under 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.131 rule 131 containing false_statements
to overcome a prior_art_reference during prosecution mr._henderson averred that` the claimed invention was actually reduced to practice and was demonstrated at a meeting.. in july of 1993'
j.a
7731 ?
9
however the district_court found that the claimed subject_matter was never actually reduced to practice
intellect 910 f.supp.2d at 1071-72 ; see j.a
2169 ; j.a
5389 ; j.a
5470
the court also found` no evidence that any of the false_statements in any of the declarations were actually withdrawn specifically called to the attention of the pto or fully corrected'
intellect 910 f.supp.2d at 1072

intellect argues that the district_court clearly erred in its materiality finding
intellect contends that mr._hendersons prosecuting attorney quickly corrected the false_declaration by filing a revised rule 131 declaration which did not include facts supporting actual_reduction to practice
see j.a
7742-846
it argues that the attorney explained to the examiner that the applicant was relying on constructive_reduction to practice
intellect contends that after the asserted_patents issued the examiner confirmed that he relied on constructive as opposed to actual reduction to practice
intellect lastly argues that the district_court discounted evidence that the remaining reference to` actual_reduction to practice' in the revised declaration was an inadvertent_mistake

htc counters that the district_court did not clearly err when it found materiality because mr._henderson filed multiple unmistakably false_declarations during prosecution
specifically it argues that mr._henderson falsely claimed actual_reduction to practice in the original rule 131 declaration in order to overcome a prior_art_reference
htc points out that the revised declaration still referred to` actual_reduction to practice'
htc argues that mr._henderson made this false assertion during prosecution of other family patents which suggests that this language was not mere drafting error
htc contends that neither mr._henderson nor his attorney expressly advised the pto about the misrepresentations during prosecution as required to cure the misconduct
it further argues that mr._hendersons post-issuance efforts to clarify the record do not cure the misconduct because they are self-serving statements made during litigation

we agree with htc
it is undisputed that mr._hendersons original_declaration was unmistakably false
absent curing this alone establishes materiality
there is no dispute in this case that mr._henderson did not actually reduce the claimed invention to practice-nor did he demonstrate a prototype in july of 1993
thus the original_declaration contains multiple unmistakably false_statements
see j.a
7731 ? ?
9 10 11` the claimed invention was actually reduced to practice *1343 and was demonstrated at a meeting' ;` the working prototype demonstration included communicating information from a calling party connected to a communications_network that provided caller identifying information to a called party' ; referring to a device that` displayed the caller_identification and associated image information transmitted via a wireless_network'
intellect argues that mr._hendersons revised declaration and subsequent statements to the pto corrected these misrepresentations
we do not agree

when an applicant files a false_declaration we require that the applicant` expressly advise the pto of [ the misrepresentations ] existence stating specifically wherein it resides'
rohm & haas co. v. crystal chem co. 722_f.2d_1556 1572 fed.cir.1983
further` if the misrepresentation is of one or more facts the pto [ must ] be advised what the actual_facts are'
id
finally the applicant must` take the necessary action.. openly
it does not suffice that one knowing of misrepresentations in an application or in its prosecution merely supplies the examiner with accurate facts without calling his attention to the untrue or misleading assertions sought to be overcome leaving him to formulate his own conclusions'
id

the district_court did not err in concluding that mr._hendersons revised declaration failed to correct the falsehoods in the original_declaration under the rohm & haas standard
see intellect 910 f.supp.2d at 1071-73
at best the revised declaration obfuscated the truth
it mentioned` diligence from the date of conception to the effective filing date' implying that mr._henderson was now relying upon constructive_reduction to practice
j.a
7745
but the revised declaration did not cure the misconduct because it never expressly negated the false references to actual_reduction to practice in the original_declaration
in the original_declaration mr._henderson told the pto that he actually reduced the invention to practice and demonstrated it at a meeting in july of 1993
see j.a
7731 ?
9
in the revised declaration he described a` prototype now in the smithsonian that was in development for a.. demonstration' in july of 1993 a statement that could be read to mean that a device embodying the claimed invention was actually built during that month
j.a
7746 ?
u
the revised declaration also described a` product_brochure and packing receipt' which further implied the existence of an actual working device
j.a
7747 ?
gg ; j.a
7852-57
finally the revised declaration expressly mentioned` actual_reduction to practice' and` bringing the claimed subject_matter to commercialization' further obscuring the truth
j.a
7747 ?
11 ; j.a
7748 ?
12
most importantly the declaration nowhere expressly stated the actual_facts which are that` neither [ mr._henderson ] nor intellect_wireless actually reduced to practice' the inventions claimed in the asserted_patents
j.a
2169
nowhere did the declaration openly advise the pto of mr._hendersons misrepresentations as our precedent clearly requires
see rohm & haas 722 f.2d at 1572

intellect asserts that mr._hendersons attorney` specifically advised the examiner on multiple occasions of the mistaken claim of actual_reduction to practice'
intellect br
35
but the record contradicts intellects position
the prosecution history of the asserted_patents is devoid of any statement by mr._henderson openly admitting that he did not actually reduce the claimed invention to practice
mr._hendersons attorney testified that in a phone call he told the examiner that the` revised declaration had none of the actual_reduction to practice elements in it' because` mr._henderson had some misgivings about the actual_reduction to practice'
*big_token__1344_j.a._4026__big_token
and mr._henderson claims that the examiner allowed the claims based on constructive_reduction to practice
see id
; see also j.a
5602` [ the examiner ] told us that he had considered only constructive_reduction to practice..' ; j.a
7982 indicating reliance on the revised declaration
neither the pto nor the public was apprised of the falsehoods in mr._hendersons declarations and told the actual_facts
thus the district_court correctly found that` [ a ] full disclosure or correction of the record was never made'
intellect 910 f.supp.2d at 1074
we hold that the district_court did not clearly err in concluding that htc proved materiality by establishing that mr._henderson engaged in affirmative egregious_misconduct when he filed a false_declaration

we note that therasense in no way modified rohm & haass holding that the materiality_prong of inequitable_conduct is met when an applicant files a false_affidavit and fails to cure the misconduct
therasense expressly cited rohm & haas with approval and made clear that filing a false_affidavit is exactly the sort of` affirmative act [ ] of egregious_misconduct' that renders the misconduct` material'
649 f.3d at 1292
indeed therasense quoted rohm & haas for the proposition that` there is no room to argue that submission of false_affidavits is not material'
id
( quoting 722 f.2d at 1571 internal quotation marks omitted
the district_court was faithful to the requirements articulated in rohm & haas
given the false_statements and the clear failure to do what is necessary according to our precedent to cure the misconduct the argument that materiality has not been established is entirely without merit

ii
intent
the district_court found that mr._henderson acted with specific_intent to deceive the pto
intellect 910 f.supp.2d at 1073-74
the court found that in addition to misrepresentations during prosecution of the asserted_patents mr._henderson made false_statements regarding actual_reduction to practice during prosecution of related_patents in order to overcome prior art
for example during prosecution of another patent in the family mr._henderson submitted a declaration stating that he had constructed a handheld device that` displayed.. message information transmitted via the wireless_network'
id.at 1062-63 ; see j.a
21910 ?
11
however the court found that no such transmission took place-the device only contained preloaded images for the purpose of demonstration
intellect 910 f.supp.2d at 1071

during prosecution of still another patent in the family mr._henderson submitted a press release to the pto stating that the smithsonian acquired` two prototypes.. for a pioneering picturephone technology developed in 1993'
j.a
25811
the district_court found that this statement was misleading because mr._henderson gave the smithsonian a device identified as` intellect prototype' in 2003 and later gave the smithsonian imitation smartphones made of wood and plastic
intellect 910 f.supp.2d at 1067-68
to be clear the wood and plastic imitation smartphones were not capable of performing the claimed functions
the court found that given the pattern of false and misleading statements during prosecution of related_patents mr._hendersons explanations for the misrepresentations during prosecution of the asserted_patents were not credible
id.at 1073
the court therefore concluded that intent to deceive the pto was the single most reasonable_inference from mr._hendersons false assertions
id

intellect argues that there was no specific_intent to deceive
it contends that *1345 mr._hendersons multiple attempts to correct the record demonstrate that intent to deceive is not the most reasonable_inference
intellect argues that mr._hendersons attorney explained that he made an inadvertent_mistake in the original_declaration by including references to actual_reduction to practice
intellect further argues that the court ignored evidence that the examiner relied on constructive rather than actual reduction to practice
it contends that these facts demonstrate that the district_courts finding that mr._henderson intended to defraud the pto was not the most reasonable_inference

intellect also contends that the courts findings regarding a pattern of deceit are erroneous
intellect argues that even though a device that mr._henderson used in his demonstration contained only preloaded images that feature is consistent with the specifications teaching that the device can display a` preselected image such as an icon'
¡¬186_patent col. 39_ll._18 -19
it argues that the smithsonian press release is irrelevant because it was submitted after the asserted_patents were allowed during prosecution of a later application
with regard to statements about actual_reduction to practice in the revised declaration intellect contends that the district_court should have drawn the inference that it was a` copy-and-paste' error
it further argues that the courts finding that mr._henderson lacked credibility was clear_error because htc failed to prove that deceit was deliberate

we see no clear_error in the district_courts fact finding on intent
submission of an affidavit containing fabricated examples of actual_reduction to practice in order to overcome a prior_art_reference raises a strong inference of intent to deceive
see rohm & haas 722 f.2d at 1571
further mr._henderson engaged in a pattern of deceit which makes the inference stronger
in order to obtain claims directed to wireless_transmission in several related_patents mr._henderson told the pto that he built a device that could receive images via wireless_transmission
see e.g. j.a
17001-02 ? ?
5-13 u.s._patent_no._7426,264 ; j.a
21910 ?
11 u.s._patent_no._7251,318 ; j.a
24136-37 ? ?
5-13 u.s._patent_no._7454,000
nevertheless the device was at best a` simulation' -it contained only preloaded images and was not capable of wireless_communication
see e.g. j.a
5449-52 ; j.a
5461-65 ; j.a
5535 ; see also intellect 910 f.supp.2d at 1071` whatever.. data was pre-loaded in the device the means a wireless_network or telephone did not exist in july of 1993 to transmit caller_id_information a picture an image or an emoticon`
intellects argument that the declaration` satisfies the specification' fails because the patent claims are directed to wireless_communication
see e.g. u.s._patent_no._7251,318 claim 1 reciting a` communications_network to wirelessly transmit the caller_id and the picture from the message_center to the wireless_portable_communication_device'
while the misleading smithsonian press release was submitted after the asserted_patents were allowed it reinforces the pattern of deceit

moreover the district_courts finding of intent could be affirmed based on the content of the two declarations
the completely false_statements in a first declaration were followed by a replacement declaration that rather than expressly admitting the earlier falsity dances around the truth
the second declaration which claims to rely on constructive rather than actual_reduction to practice continues to reference a` prototype' that was never built a` product_brochure' even though there was no product and` commercialization' that never occurred

as discussed earlier neither mr. *1346 henderson nor his attorney told the examiner the truth
thus the district_court did not clearly err in concluding that specific_intent to deceive the pto was the most reasonable_inference from mr._hendersons conduct

the district_court also did not err when it decided not to credit mr._hendersons explanations for the repeated submission of false_affidavits
`` [ c ] redibility determinations are an aspect of fact-finding that appellate courts should rarely reverse'
star scientific inc. v. r.j. reynolds tobacco co. 537_f.3d_1357 1368 fed.cir.2008
the pattern of deceit supports the courts finding that mr._hendersons explanations for making false_statements during prosecution of the asserted_patents are not credible

conclusion
we have considered the parties remaining arguments and do not find them to be persuasive
we affirm the district_courts judgment that the asserted_patents are unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct

affirmed
