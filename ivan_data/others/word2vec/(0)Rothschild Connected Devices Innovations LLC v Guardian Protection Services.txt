background
the instant dispute arises as a consequence of rothschilds allegation that adss home_security_system infringes u.s._patent_no._8788,090` the090_patent`
the090_patent generally recites` [ a ] system and method for creating a personalized_consumer_product'090_patent abstract where the system and method` enable a user to customize products containing solids and fluids by allowing a server on the global computer network e.g. the internet to instruct the hardware mixing the solids and fluids of the users preferences for the final mix' id
col. 1_ll._58 -62
rothschild has filed numerous_lawsuits against various parties alleging infringement of the090_patent
j.a
1086 1097

rothschild filed a complaint against ads alleging infringement of claim 1 of the090_patent
j.a
62 73
ads responded by filing an answer and counterclaims
j.a
84-92
ads subsequently sent an email to rothschild alleging that the090_patent covers patent-ineligible_subject_matter under 35 u.s.c.¡± 1011 and that prior_art anticipates claim 1 of the090_patent under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 a 12 j.a
*1386 704
ads offered to settle the case if rothschild paid ads $ 43,330 for attorney_fees and costs
j.a
704
rothschild rejected adss offer
j.a
855

ads next filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings arguing that claim 1 of the090_patent covers patent-ineligible_subject_matter under ¡± 101
j.a
93-104
ads also sent rothschild a notice pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure 11 c 2` safe_harbor_notice'3 which included copies of a proposed rule 11 b motion for sanctions and prior_art that purportedly anticipates claim 1
j.a
270 685
in light of the safe_harbor_notice rothschild voluntarily moved to dismiss its action
see j.a
247
ads opposed and filed a cross-motion for attorney_fees pursuant to ¡± 285,4 see j.a
249 based on its view that rothschilds suit was objectively unreasonable because rothschild knew or should have known that claim 1 covers patent-ineligible_subject_matter under ¡± 101 and is anticipated by prior_art under ¡± 102 a 1 see j.a
261-64
ads also argued that rothschild did not intend to test the merits of its claim and instead filed this and over fifty other lawsuits in the district_court to`exploit [ ] the high cost to defend complex litigation to extract nuisance value settlements` from various defendants

the district_court ultimately granted rothschilds motion to dismiss and denied adss cross-motion for attorney_fees
rothschild 2016_wl_3883549 at *4
as to the latter the district_court found that rothschild did not engage in conduct sufficient to make the action` exceptional' under ¡± 285
id
the district_court found that rothschilds` decision to voluntarily withdraw its [ c ] omplaint within the safe_harbor_period is the type of reasonable_conduct rule 11 is designed to encourage'
id.at *2
the district_court also found that rothschild recited` non-conclusory and facially plausible arguments supporting patent_eligibility' under ¡± 101
id
turning to the anticipation allegations the district_court found that ads neither filed a motion seeking to invalidate claim 1 of the090_patent under ¡± 102 a 1 nor demonstrated that rothschild failed to conduct a reasonable pre-suit investigation of the prior_art
id
finally the district_court held that rothschilds numerous other suits for infringement pending against other companies did not alone make the case exceptional

this appeal followed

discussion
i
legal framework and standard of review
a` court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney_fees to the prevailing *1387 party'
35 u.s.c.¡± 285
the supreme_court has explained that an exceptional case though rare is simply one that stands out from others with respect to the substantive_strength of a partys litigating_position considering both the governing law and the facts of the case or the unreasonable manner in which the case was litigated
district courts may determine whether a case is` exceptional' in the case-by-case exercise of their discretion considering the totality of the circumstances
octane_fitness llc v. icon_health & fitness inc. -- - u.s. -- -- 134_s.ct._1749 1756 188_l.ed.2d_816_(2014) footnote omitted ; see id.at 1757 explaining that` a district_court may award fees in the rare_case in which a partys unreasonable_conduct-while not independently sanctionable-is nonetheless soexceptional as to justify an award of fees'
in weighing the evidence the district_court may consider among other factors` frivolousness motivation objective unreasonableness both in the factual and legal components of the case [ ] and the need in particular circumstances to advance considerations of compensation and deterrence'
id.at 1756 n.6 internal_quotation_marks and citation omitted ; see also id.at 1758 explaining that a ¡± 285 attorney_fee_award is appropriate` when the losing party has acted in bad_faith vexatiously wantonly or for oppressive reasons' internal_quotation_marks and citation omitted

ii
the district_courts exceptional case determination constitutes an abuse of discretion
ads challenges the district_courts exceptional_case_determination on several grounds
first ads alleges that the district_court failed to properly assess the weakness of rothschilds litigating_position because claim 1 of the090_patent covers patent-ineligible_subject_matter under ¡± 101 and is anticipated by the prior_art under ¡± 102 a 1
see appellants br
18-32
second ads avers that` the district_court failed to consider rothschilds willful_ignorance of the prior_art' which further demonstrates the weakness of rothschilds litigating_position
id.at 32 capitalization modified ; see id.at 32-35
third ads contends that rothschild engaged in vexatious_litigation by bringing suit solely to extract a nuisance payment citing the numerous_lawsuits that rothschild has filed regarding the090_patent
see id.at 37-40
fourth ads argues that the district_court failed to` consider the totality of the circumstances as required by octane_fitness' because inter_alia it` improperly conflat [ ed ] the provisions of rule 11 and *1388 relief under [ ¡± ] 285'
id.at 40 ; see id.at 40-43

we need not address adss first argument because the second third and fourth arguments demonstrate an abuse of discretion
we address these three arguments in turn

a
the district_court misjudged the strength of rothschilds litigating position in consideration of the prior art
ads avers that rothschild submitted affidavits that include statements` evidenc [ ing ] a conscious disregard for rothschilds continuing obligation to inquire into the merits of its case'
id.at 33
according to ads the district_court did` not address [ ] these troubling statements'
id
ads argues that the district_court thus` fail [ ed ] to properly assess the substantive_strength of rothschilds litigating_position'
id.at 35

the district_court clearly erred by failing to consider rothschilds willful_ignorance of the prior_art
in its safe_harbor_notice and cross-motion for attorney_fees ads included prior_art that purportedly anticipates claim 1 of the090_patent
j.a
293-94 334-679 685
in response to adss cross-motion for attorney_fees rothschild submitted two affidavits relevant here
in the first rothschilds counsel stated that he had` not conducted an analysis of any of the prior_art asserted in [ the ] cross [ ] motion to form a belief as to whether that prior_art would invalidate' the090_patent
j.a
708
in the second rothschilds founder echoed these statements
j.a
712-13
however in the same affidavits rothschilds counsel and founder both assert that they possessed a` good_faith' belief that the090_patent` is valid'
j.a
708 712
it is unclear how rothschilds counsel and founder could reasonably believe that claim 1 is valid if neither analyzed the purportedly invalidating prior_art provided by ads.5 more problematic here the district_court did not address these incongruent statements in its analysis
see generally rothschild 2016_wl_3883549
a district_court abuses its discretion when as here it` fail [ s ] to conduct an adequate inquiry'
atl
research mktg sys. inc. v. troy 659_f.3d_1345 1360 fed
cir
2011

other aspects of the relevant affidavits reveal additional problems with the district_courts analysis
for example rothschilds counsel attested that adss proposed rule 11 b motion` should not be granted' j.a
708 and rothschilds founder stated that the rule 11 b motion` should be found.. meritless' j.a
713
rothschilds counsel and founder reached those conclusions without examining the purportedly anticipatory_prior_art_references attached to the safe_harbor_notice
see j.a
708 712-13
it is unclear how rothschilds counsel and founder reasonably *1389 could assert that adss rule 11 b motion would be meritless if they did not assess the prior_art that accompanied the safe_harbor_notice
once again the district_court did not address these inconsistent statements in its analysis
see generally rothschild 2016_wl_3883549

rothschild nevertheless asserts that it` brought its claims against ads in good_faith' that its counsel reviewed the prior_art and determined that adss home_security_system infringed claim 1 of the090_patent and that it continues to believe that the090_patent is valid
appellees br
9 footnote omitted
in support of its position rothschild cites its opposition to adss cross-motion for attorney_fees id.at 9_nn._33 -35 citing j.a
693 and its opposition in turn cites the affidavits discussed above j.a
693 citing j.a
707-08 712
in his affidavit rothschilds counsel asserts that before filing the lawsuit he made a` good_faith' determination` that the accused [ ads ] products infringed at least_claim 1' and that he` assisted in preparing a claim chart identifying how the elements of claim 1 of the [090_patent ] read on the products accused of infringement'
j.a
707 708
rothschilds counsel also asserts that he` believe [ s ] in good_faith that the [090_patent ] is valid and infringed'
j.a
708
rothschilds founder makes a similar statement as to the validity of the090_patent
j.a
712

none of the cited statements assist rothschild here
in his declaration rothschilds counsel states that he` reviewed publicly available_information regarding adss products and in good_faith made a determination that the accused products infringed at least_claim 1 of the [090_patent ]'
j.a
707
rothschilds founder makes similar statements in his declaration
see j.a
712
however neither rothschilds counsel nor its founder supports their declaration statements with examples of websites product brochures manuals or any other publicly available_information that they purportedly reviewed.6 the conclusory and unsupported statements from rothschilds counsel and founder that claim 1 of the090_patent is valid have no evidentiary_value
see phigenix inc. v. immunogen inc. 845_f.3d_1168 1174-75 & n.6 fed
cir
2017

b
the district_court misjudged rothschilds conduct in other litigation
ads next alleges that rothschild has engaged in vexatious_litigation related to the090_patent
according to ads rothschild has asserted claim 1 of the090_patent in fifty-eight cases against technologies ranging from video cameras to coffeemakers to heat pumps
appellants br
9
further ads contends that rothschild has settled the vast majority if not all of these cases for significantly below the average cost of defending an infringement lawsuit
see id.at 37-40
the district_court rejected adss contention finding` the fact that a patentee has asserted a patent against a wide variety of defendants and settled many of those cases.. does not alone show bad_faith'
rothschild 2016_wl_3883549 at *3 emphasis added internal_quotation_marks and citation omitted

the district_court based this aspect of its analysis on a clearly erroneous_assessment of the evidence
the district_court predicated its finding on` the absence of any showing that [ rothschild ] acted unreasonably or in bad_faith in the context of this suit'
id
( footnote omitted
however *1390 as explained above that ancillary finding improperly rests upon statements from rothschilds counsel and founder that have no evidentiary_value
therefore in the absence of evidence demonstrating that rothschild engaged in reasonable_conduct before the district_court the undisputed evidence regarding rothschilds vexatious_litigation warrants an affirmative exceptional case finding here
see newegg 793 f.3d at 1350` [ a ] pattern of litigation abuses characterized by the repeated filing of patent infringement actions for the sole purpose of forcing settlements with no intention of testing the merits of ones claims is relevant to a district_courts exceptional_case_determination under ¡± 285
`` ; see also eon-net 653 f.3d at 1327 noting that settlement offers that were` less than ten percent of the cost that [ a defendant ] expended to defend suit-effectively ensured that [ a plaintiffs ] baseless infringement allegations remain unexposed'

c. the district_court improperly conflated rule 11_with_35 u.s.c.¡± 285
finally we turn to adss argument that the district_court failed to account for the totality of the circumstances by equating rule 11 to ¡± 285
the district_court held that` ¡± 285 should [ not ] be applied in a manner that contravenes the aims of rule 11- [ rothschild ]s decision to voluntarily withdraw its complaint within the safe_harbor_period is the type of reasonable_conduct [ that ] rule 11 is designed to encourage'
rothschild 2016_wl_3883549 at *2
ads avers that the district_courts analysis` improperly conflat [ ed ] the provisions of rule 11 and relief under [ ¡± ] 285'
appellants br
40

the district_court erred as a matter of law when as part of its analysis it stated that an attorney_fee_award under ¡± 285 would` contravene [ ] the aims of rule 11 [s ]' safe-harbor provision
rothschild 2016_wl_3883549 at *2
whether a party avoids or engages in sanctionable conduct under rule 11 b` is not the appropriate benchmark' ; indeed` a district_court may award fees in the rare_case in which a partys unreasonable_conduct-while not necessarily independently sanctionable-is nonetheless soexceptional as to justify an award of fees'
octane_fitness 134 s.ct.at 1756 1757

conclusion
we have considered adss remaining arguments except for those related to its first point and find them unpersuasive
the district_court on remand shall conduct additional proceedings consistent with this opinion including those pertaining to the calculation of attorney_fees
accordingly the opinion and order of the u.s._district_court for the eastern_district of texas is

reversed and remanded

mayer circuit_judge concurring
i agree with the courts opinion but write separately because this case also satisfies the supreme_courts admonition that` a case presenting.. exceptionally meritless claims may sufficiently set itself apart from mine-run cases to warrant a fee award'
octane_fitness llc v. icon_health & fitness inc. -- - u.s. -- -- 134_s.ct._1749 1757 188_l.ed.2d_816_(2014)
because the infringement complaint filed by rothschild_connected_devices_innovations llc` rothschild' was frivolous on its face the district_court abused its discretion in refusing to award attorneys fees under 35 u.s.c.¡± 285

*big_token__1391_claim_1__big_token of u.s._patent_no._8788,090 patent the`090_patent` is directed to the abstract idea of product configuration reciting` [ a ] system for customizing a product according to a users preferences' using` a remote server including a database'
'090_patent col.8 ll.66-67
both the specification and the prosecution history indicate that claim 1 is limited to consumable liquid products
see e.g. id
col.1 ll.21-62 ; id
col.4 ll.40-64 ; joint appendix` j.a'
769 799-804 821 846-47
nonetheless rothschild has filed scores of infringement complaints taking an exceptionally broad view of the scope of its patent and asserting that it covers dozens of seemingly unrelated` products' configured using the internet
j.a
99-100 878
the breadth of technologies that have been accused of infringement is remarkable including such diverse products as home automation systems home_security_systems door locks mobile apps thermostats digital cameras irrigation sprinklers coffeemakers washers dryers baby monitors air conditioners microwave ovens dishwashers smoke detectors ceiling fans window shades pool heaters telephones and horns
see j.a
256-58
rothschilds continued assertions that its patent extends to products simply because they are configured using the internet see brief of plaintiff-appellee at 19-21 are risible rather than simply unreasonable

in assessing patent_eligibility under 35 u.s.c.¡± 101` the underlying functional concern.. is a relative one how much future innovation is foreclosed relative to the contribution of the inventor'

the090_patent falls far beyond the bounds of section 101 because its potential to disrupt future innovation is staggering while its technological contribution is non-existent

because section 101 imposes` a threshold test' bilski v. kappos 561_u.s._593 602 130_s.ct._3218 177_l.ed.2d_792_(2010) patent_eligibility issues generally can and should be resolved at the outset of litigation
neither nuanced legal analysis nor complex technical inquiry was required to determine that the090_patent could not be both broad enough to cover the home security products sold by ads_security l.p.` ads' and narrow enough to withstand subject matter eligibility scrutiny
see alice corp. v. cls bank int l -- - u.s. -- -- 134_s.ct._2347 2356-59 189_l.ed.2d_296_(2014) emphasizing that abstract ideas applied using generic computer components are patent ineligible ; intellectual ventures i llc v. capital one bank 792_f.3d_1363 1369 fed
