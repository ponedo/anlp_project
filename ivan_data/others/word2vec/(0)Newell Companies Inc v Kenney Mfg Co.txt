) in a patent infringement suit brought against kenney manufacturing company
following a jury_trial in which the jury answered interrogatories responding inter_alia that no claims in issue of united_states patent no._4006,770 the770_patent owned by newell were proved invalid for obviousness under the standard of 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 1982 the district_court granted kenneys reserved motion for directed verdict and entered judgment for kenney on that issue holding claims 1 2 6_and_7 invalid
we affirm

i
background
the invention of the770_patent relates to retractable up and down window_shades
ferguson the inventor was products manager of newells window_shade division and developed the shade after seeing certain vinyl shade_material manufactured by sean corcoran
corcorans material is scored partially through in lines parallel to one lengthwise edge so that it can be torn to a desired width
its advantage over other scored shade_materials is that light does not shine through the scored portion

corcoran sought a patent which claimed his shade_material in combination with a roller and in in re corcoran 640_f.2d_1331 208_uspq_867_(ccpa_1981) a predecessor of this court addressed the patentability of corcorans invention
because the corcoran_material had been placed on sale in the united_states in 1972 more than a year before the filing date of corcorans application and the combination with a roller would have been obvious corcoran was held to have lost his right to a patent under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b /¡± 103 1982
specifically the court stated as to the support means we conclude that given the plastic sheet shade_material denominated a` window_shade' nothing could be more obvious than to attach it to a roller or other support
id.at 1334 208 uspq at 870
the corcoran_material alone or in combination with a roller thus was unprotectable and freely available for anyone to use

after learning of the corcoran_material in late 1973 or early 1974 ferguson sensing the market potential contacted corcoran who resided in ireland and requested sample shades
corcoran sent the shades along with a letter explaining that he would not have the output to supply newell until 1975 and that at the time rollers were in better supply and cheaper in america
this correspondence led to meetings and eventually to a business arrangement between corcoran and newell
ferguson proceeded to develop the subject_matter of the770_patent which attaches the corcoran_material to a telescoping roller having a smaller section able to slide inside a larger section

ferguson claims the advantage that his shade can be assembled by consumers without the use of tools
as explained in *760 the specification the material is affixed to the larger_roller_section
after adjusting the width of the material and roller the consumer removes a protective cover on an adhesive strip on the smaller roller end and presses the material onto that adhesive
in conducting test marketing newell made shades from material supplied by corcoran and from telescoping rollers available on the market and made by clopay corporation
as described infra the clopay_roller came with a cardboard_sleeve which fitted over its smaller telescoping end
that sleeve was unnecessary in the ferguson assembly and was simply discarded
the clopay_roller is the subject of united_states patent no._3203,468 the468_patent issued to gossling and owned by clopay

shortly thereafter ferguson applied for the patent which is the subject of this suit
claim 1 of the770_patent which issued to ferguson in february 1977 reads in an extensible and retractable roll window_shade_assembly which is width adjustable and installable by the consumer without the use of tools or cutting elements the combination of a telescoping roller_assembly said telescoping roller_assembly including a first_roller_section said first_roller_section having a constant external diameter from end_portion to end_portion the outer_end_portion of said first_roller_section having first means for supporting the window_shade_assembly from a first support location the inner end_portion of said first_roller_section having an opening therein of a size to receive a second_roller_section said second_roller_section having a constant nominal external diameter from end_portion to end_portion the outer_end_portion of said second_roller_section having second means for supporting the window_shade_assembly from a second support location said second_roller_section being telescopically slidably received within the first_roller_section whereby the length of the roller_assembly can be adjustable within the limits of the range of telescoping movement means for precluding relative rotation between the first and second_roller_sections a shade of flexible sheet material a first portion of the upper_end of the shade being secured to the first_roller_section one side portion of the shade having a plurality of lines of weakness which extend from the upper_end of the shade to the lower end of the shade whereby the width of the shade can be adjusted to a desired width by separating a portion of the side of the shade from the balance of the shade said separated portion being bounded on the outside by the original shade edge and on the inside by a line of weakness along which said portion is separated from the balance of the shade said first and second telescoping roller sections being adjustable to an overall length which is at least as wide as the length of the final shade width without severance of any portion of either section securement means for securing the second portion of the upper_end of the shade which is generally aligned with the second_roller_section in fixed relationship to the second smaller external diameter roller section with a substantially constant securing force from point to point along the length of the portion of the second_roller_section which extends beyond the end of the first_roller_section whereby the positions of the first and second_roller_sections are fixed with respect to one another and to the shade throughout the entire area of overlap of the shade and the roller_assembly

the newell window_shade was successful with consumers immediately on its introduction into full marketing in october 1975
other shade companies introduced competing products
in july 1981 kenneys do-it-yourself shade appeared in response to the requirements of its customer k-mart
the kenney_shade was made with scored material and a telescoping roller but unlike fergusons design the shade_material was attached to the larger_roller_section only and was simply allowed to wrap loosely around the smaller end

at trial kenney asserted numerous defenses but the dispositive_issue here is whether the770 invention would have been obvious from prior_art which includes *761 the corcoran_material telescoping rollers and various means for securing a shade to a roller including adhesive strips and partial securement as in the kenney_shade
at the conclusion of presentation of evidence both parties moved for a directed verdict on which the district_court reserved its rulings and the case was submitted to the jury
in its instructions the court directed the jury to answer a series of questions including a question whether any of the claims of newells770_patent would have been obvious to which the jury answered` no' and whether kenney infringed any claims to which the jury answered` yes'
after receipt of the jurys verdict in this form the court made its rulings on the parties motions for directed verdict denying newells and granting kenney's.1 the district_court set out in detail a set of facts and explained the basis for its decision holding claims 1 2 6 and 7 unpatentable under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 that is the court concluded from this set of facts that the invention would have been obvious to one of ordinary_skill in the art.2 the court also held that the jurys verdict was not reasonable
newell appeals the grant of judgment for kenney

after entry of judgment kenney moved for attorney_fees
the court denied that motion and kenney cross-appeals the denial of attorney_fees.3

ii
issues in newells appeal
the dispositive_issue in newells appeal is whether the trial_court erred in setting aside the jurys verdict of nonobviousness of the subject_invention
newell does not challenge the trial_courts statement of the facts underlying the trial_courts obviousness_conclusion except in an immaterial detail
newells challenge is two-fold
first it argues that the trial_court improperly substituted its conclusion on obviousness for that of the jury and second it argues that in any event the subject_invention meets the statutory_standard of section 103
we deal with these arguments in turn

iii
standard of review of the grant of directed_verdict or jnov
the first issue raised by newell presents the question whether a litigant is entitled *762 to a jury_verdict on a disputed issue of obviousness where there are no disputed issues of material_fact underlying that issue
in hepner v. united_states 213_u.s._103 29_s.ct._474 53_l.ed._720_(1909) which upheld the grant of a directed verdict and was reaffirmed in tull v. united_states 481_u.s._412 107_s.ct._1831 95_l.ed.2d_365_(1987) the court stated the objection made in behalf of the defendant that an affirmative answer to the question certified [ 4 ] could be used so as to destroy the constitutional_right of trial by jury is without merit and need not be discussed
the defendant was of course entitled to have a jury summoned in this case but that right was subject to the condition fundamental in the conduct of civil actions that the court may withdraw a case from the jury and direct a verdict according to the law if the evidence is uncontradicted and raises only a question of law

restricting our decision to civil cases in which the testimony is undisputed and without qualifying former decisions requiring the court to send a case to the jury under proper instructions as to the law where the evidence is conflicting on any essential point we answer the question here certified in the affirmative
213 u.s. at 115 29 s.ct.at 479-80
all of our precedent holds that where the only_issue is as here the application of the statutory_standard of obviousness 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 to an established set of facts there is only a question of law to be resolved by the trial_judge and that the trial_courts conclusion on obviousness is subject to full and independent_review by this court

in a case directly on point in ruling on a jnov_motion medtronic inc. v. intermedics inc. 799_f.2d_734 738 230_uspq_641 643 fed.cir.1986 cert
denied 479_u.s._1033 107_s.ct._882 93_l.ed.2d_836_(1987) judge davis stated the law in exemplary fashion as follows on this appeal intermedics does not contest the graham factual inquiries stipulated by the parties or decided by the jury ; rather intermedics disputes only the ultimate_conclusion of nonobviousness with respect to claims 1_and_7 of the c/d patent
obviousness is a question of law
in reviewing a district_courts refusal to grant jnov it is the duty of this court to be satisfied that the law has been correctly applied to the facts found
structural_rubber products 749 f.2d at 719 223 uspq at 1273 ; railroad_dynamics inc. 727 f.2d at 1512 220 uspq at 936
similarly structural_rubber products co. v. park rubber co. 749_f.2d_707 223_uspq_1264_(fed.cir.1984) held the introduction of a jury can not change the nature of the obviousness decision
it continues to be a legal_issue for the court
indeed the role of a trial_court should not be significantly different in a patent jury_trial from its role in a patent bench_trial with respect to legal_issues
on appeal the standard of review applied by an appellate_court to factual_issues is affected by the different type of trial
findings of fact by the jury are more difficult to set aside being reviewed only for reasonableness under the substantial_evidence test than those of a trial_judge to which the clearly erroneous rule applies
but the standard of review of the conclusion on obviousness remains the same-it is a question of law
thus it is the duty of the appellate_court to be satisfied that the law has been correctly applied to the facts regardless of whether the facts were determined by judge or jury

denied 469_u.s._825 105_s.ct._104 83_l.ed.2d_49_(1984) ; american_hoist & derrick *763 co. v. sowa & sons inc. 725_f.2d_1350 1361 220_uspq_763 772 fed.cir.1984 remanded because` [ a ] district_court may not solicit only a legal_conclusion [ on obviousness ] from the jury'

our precedent on summary_judgment motions which are decided under essentially the same standard as that for a motion for directed verdict or jnov anderson v. liberty_lobby inc. 477_u.s._242 250 106_s.ct._2505 2511 91_l.ed.2d_202_(1986) is in accord with the above decisions
in that connection we have held that where the ultimate_legal_conclusion of obviousness is disputed but not the underlying facts there is no issue of fact requiring a trial even though some facts favor obviousness some nonobviousness
see e.g. union carbide corp. v. american can co. 724_f.2d_1567 220_uspq_584_(fed.cir.1984) ; chore-time equip. inc. v. cumberland corp. 713_f.2d_774 218_uspq_673_(fed.cir.1983)
this is so even in a case where a jury is demanded because it is not the function of the jury to pick and choose among established facts relating to obviousness in contrast to its obligation to sift through conflicting evidence and determine what those facts are
on the other hand where there appears to be a genuine evidentiary conflict over an underlying material_fact the grant of summary_judgment is inappropriate
see e.g. finish eng g co. v. zerpa indus. inc. 806_f.2d_1041 1_uspq2d_1114_(fed.cir.1986)
at times no doubt` the issues may be such that only after the agony of a full-blown trial may it authoritatively be determined that there was never really the decisive issue of fact at all'
robbins v. milner enters. inc. 278_f.2d_492 497 5th cir.1960
but there is no question that the court may take the issue from the jury on a directed verdict or jnov_motion at least in the same circumstances where it could have granted summary_judgment

all the above merely reflects that a party has a right to a jury_trial in an action at law not a right to a jury_verdict
a jury_verdict need not be obtained and may be set aside under the common_law principles incorporated into the constitution where there is no fact_issue for the jury to decide.5 the authority of the judge to rule on issues of law during the course of proceedings is an essential element of a jury_trial

as explained in herron v. southern pacific co. 283_u.s._91 95 51_s.ct._383 384 75_l.ed._857_(1931) in a trial by jury in a federal court the judge is not a mere moderator but is the governor of the trial for the purpose of assuring its proper conduct and of determining questions of law
this discharge of the judicial function as at common_law is an essential factor in the process for which the federal constitution provides..' trial by jury' said the court in capital traction co. v. hof 174_u.s._1 13 14 [ 19_s.ct._580 585 585-86 43_l.ed._873_(1899) ]` in the primary and usual sense of the term at the common_law and in the american constitutions is not merely a trial by a jury of twelve men before an officer vested with authority to cause them to be summoned and empanelled to administer oaths to them and to the constable in charge and to enter judgment and issue execution on their verdict ; but it is a trial by a jury of *764 twelve men in the presence and under the superintendence of a judge empowered to instruct them on the law and to advise them on the facts and except on acquittal of a criminal charge to set aside their verdict if in his opinion it is against the law or the evidence'

had the trial_court failed to exercise that authority here,6 a constitutional jury_trial would have been denied not upheld

notwithstanding the above precedent newell finds support in some decisions of this court for its argument that the district_court improperly substituted its determination of obviousness for that of` reasonable_jurors' namely this courts opinions in perkin-elmer_corp. v. computervision_corp. 732_f.2d_888 221_uspq_669_(fed.cir.) cert
denied 469_u.s._857 105_s.ct._187 83_l.ed.2d_120_(1984) ; railroad_dynamics inc. v. a. stucki co. 727_f.2d_1506 220_uspq_929_(fed.cir.) cert
denied 469_u.s._871 105_s.ct._220 83_l.ed.2d_150_(1984) ; and connell v. sears roebuck & co. 722_f.2d_1542 220_uspq_193_(fed.cir.1983)
in particular newell points to statements in connell that` it is not error to submit the question of obviousness to the jury' connell 722 f.2d at 1547 220 uspq at 197 and that` [ j ] ury verdicts must be treated with great deference' id.at 1546 220 uspq at 196
newell fails to note that in connell this court affirmed the setting aside of a jury_verdict of nonobviousness of the invention
newell also fails to note the entirety of the courts statement in connell
this court held in connell that although it is not error to submit the obviousness/nonobviousness issue to the jury` it is ultimately a question of law decidable by the court in response to a motion for jnov'
id.at 1550 220 uspq at 200
it must also be pointed out that connell involved submission of the obviousness issue where there were material factual disputes not submission of that issue where no underlying facts are in dispute` the facts underlying the jurys nonobviousness_conclusion were not supported by substantial_evidence' id.at 1548 220 uspq at 198

were we to adopt newells argument that where no facts are in dispute connell requires that obviousness be determined by the opinion of reasonable_jurors on whether the statutory_standard of section 103 was or was not satisfied our decisions in medtronic structural_rubber and white among others would be in direct_conflict with connell
by the same token connell would then be in conflict with our prior summary_judgment and bench_trial rulings which hold that the ultimate_conclusion of obviousness that is the application of the statutory_standard to a set of facts is an issue of law and like any other issue of law is subject to independent_plenary_review and determination by this court.7

*765 this court has adopted the rule that prior_decisions of a panel of the court are binding precedent on subsequent panels unless and until overturned in banc
see umc elecs co. v. united_states 816_f.2d_647 652_n._6 2_uspq2d_1465 1468_n._6_(errata) fed.cir.1987 cert
denied 484_u.s._1025 108_s.ct._748 98_l.ed.2d_761_(1988)
where there is direct_conflict the precedential decision is the first
even if all comments in the decisions considered here are not completely harmonious newell points to no actual conflict and we see none
nothing said in structural_rubber medtronic or in any other prior decision or in this opinion should be interpreted to mean that because a court must make its independent decision on the ultimate issue of obviousness a court can also make its own factual_findings on that issue independent of the jury
a jurys resolution of evidentiary conflicts to establish the facts is the essence of its role in a jury_trial
judges must accept the factual_findings presumed from a favorable jury_verdict which are supported under the substantial_evidence/reasonable juror standard
see structural_rubber 749 f.2d at 719 223 uspq at 1273 ; medtronic 799 f.2d at 738 230 uspq at 643
those opinions do not depart from the holding in connell
where the case turns on resolution of a factual issue the issue of obviousness may be given to the jury with proper instructions.8

conversely nothing said in connell railroad_dynamics or perkin-elmer entitles newell to a jury_verdict where there is no genuinely or substantially disputed issue of material_fact underlying the obviousness determination
in that instance there is only an issue of law for the trial_court to resolve and that courts conclusion is subject to plenary review in this court

significant to an understanding of our precedent is that a number of earlier appeals in jury cases had been tried under the law of certain circuits precedent which held that obviousness was a question of fact.9 in such circuits the jury was not infrequently asked to answer the question of obviousness in a special fact verdict under rule 49 a of the federal_rules of civil_procedure.10 in any appeal of course an appellate_court must decide whether the ultimate judgment can be sustained
any error must be harmful
thus when the parties presented the case to this court in a manner which defined appropriate issues for resolution this court proceeded to resolve those issues
procedural errors that do not unfairly affect the outcome are to be ignored
trials must be fair not perfect
see fonar_corp. v. johnson & johnson 821_f.2d_627 633 3_uspq2d_1109 1114 fed.cir.1987 cert
denied 484_u.s._1027 108_s.ct._751 98_l.ed.2d_764_(1988)
this is such a case
giving the jury a direct question to answer on the legal_issue of obviousness was technically a violation of rule 49 a but harmless here
newell does not challenge the statement in the trial_courts opinion as to the underlying material_facts
thus the issue presented to us is solely a legal question we may decide specifically whether the statutory_standard of obviousness` has been correctly applied to the facts found'

accordingly we turn to the merits of the courts ruling holding the770_patent invalid under section 103

iv
the district_court correctly held that invention of the770_patent would have been obvious
the district_court began its obviousness analysis by delineating the obviousness standard as set forth in graham v. john_deere_co. 383_u.s._1 17 86_s.ct._684 693-694 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966) and the significance of` secondary_considerations' as interpreted in stratoflex inc. v. aeroquip_corp. 713_f.2d_1530 1538-39 218_uspq_871 879 fed.cir.1983 and environmental designs ltd. v. union_oil_co. 713_f.2d_693 695 218_uspq_865 867 fed.cir.1983 cert
denied 464_u.s._1043 104_s.ct._709 79_l.ed.2d_173_(1984)
the court further stated that it was mindful of the presumption of validity and that kenney bore the burden of establishing facts by clear and convincing_evidence which established invalidity citing perkin-elmer 732 f.2d at 894 221 uspq at 674

the court noted that the corcoran_material and shade_design which had not been considered by the pto_examiner were prior_art ; also that corcoran contemplated using a roller which could be adjusted albeit by cutting to conform to the adjusted width of the shade_material

the court noted that numerous prior patents showed telescoping rollers adjustable in width to which window_shade_material was attached
it particularly analyzed the united_states patents to gossling no._3203,468 and no._3299,944 for window_shades with adjustable telescoping rollers
in both the shade_material is adhesively secured directly to the larger_roller_section as in the claims sub judice
they also disclose that the material extending over the smaller_roller_section can be kept from drooping by adhesively affixing it to a cardboard_sleeve over the smaller_roller_section or by discarding the sleeve and providing extra_rolls of material to form a tube-like structure around the smaller_roller_section.11

the court noted that no single item of prior_art specifically covered a shade using the improved corcoran-type scored vinyl material on a telescoping roller
gossling468 and944 for example show mounting cuttable cloth fabric on a telescoping roller
however there was evidence that others of ordinary_skill in the art had prior to fergusons invention proposed securing other less satisfactory strippable shade_material to telescoping rollers to achieve do-it-yourself adjustability without tools.12 in sum the court concluded however that` [ g ] iven the nature of the [ corcoran ] material it would have been obvious to one with ordinary_skill in the art to mount that shade_material on a telescoping roller well known in the art which could be quickly shortened to match the width of the shade
like the corcoran court [ the ccpa ] this court feels that.. nothing could be more obvious..` newell 606 f.supp.at 1296 226 uspq at 166

*767 in reaching the conclusion that the invention of the770_patent would have been obvious the trial_court gave deference to the presumption of validity of the patent and to the evidence of commercial_success
it resisted hindsight reconstruction of the invention and did not rely simply on the individual elements of the claim being in the prior_art but also on evidence of the level of skill in the art with respect to the making of the combination
no fault can be found in the legal propositions on which the court relied or in the courts method of analysis and newell asserts none

newell first asserts that the trial_court erred in reversing the jurys verdict of nonobviousness because the trial_court narrowly construed the` securement means' element of the claim limiting it to` adhesive'
newell does not argue that the claim excludes adhesive but rather that other means are covered as well.13 this argument is meritless
a narrow construction of` securement means' was not prejudicial to newell on the issue of obviousness

newell asserts that to set aside the verdict kenney had to meet an` almost impossibly lofty standard.. after the jury found that kenney did not meet its burden of proof'
contrary to kenneys argument the trial_court was not restricted in applying the legal test for obviousness to the established facts either by a quantum of proof or by a` lofty' standard
quantums of proof relate to proof of facts not legal_conclusions

newell argues that the trial_court was required to consider the evidence in the light most favorable to newell and to draw the` inference' of obviousness in newells favor
however the requirement to draw favorable` inferences' relates only to factual inferences not to legal_conclusions based on an established set of facts even though those facts do not all favor that conclusion
see petersen mfg co. v. central purchasing inc. 740_f.2d_1541 1548 222_uspq_562 567 fed.cir.1984` nor is the courts conclusion on obviousness an adverse inference of fact

newell states as a legal proposition` the law presumes the existence of findings [ by the jury ] necessary to support the verdict'
in the context of this case that proposition overstates the presumption from the verdict
it is well settled that the jury is presumed to have resolved disputed factual_issues in favor of the verdict winner
however it may not be presumed that the jury found facts on which there is no evidence
nor is the jury free to discard probative admissions and undisputed facts

newell argues that the gossling references teach away from a do-it-yourself adjustable shade which does not require use of tools because that art requires` cutting the shade_material'
once corcoran invented his plastic tearable material and publicly disclosed it however the problem of having to cut the material was eliminated
the inventor ferguson himself candidly admitted' q do you agree mr._ferguson with the statement that nothing could be more obvious than to mount corcoran_shade_material on a roller adapted to be reduced in length ?
`` a yes it was'
ferguson responded similarly to another question' q [ w ] ould n't it be obvious to a man skilled in the art as of february 1974 to put [ the corcoran_material ] on a roller which could likewise be reduced in length to correspond to the width of the window ?
`` a that could be put on a telesoping roller yes
`` q my question was would n't it be obvious to a man skilled in the art that he could do that ?
`` a yes he could put it on a roller'
ferguson went even further and admitted the significance of the corcoran_material to the success of the invention in the following testimony' q do you agree mr._ferguson that you did not contribute the inventive thing which made the newell_shade a commercial_success ?
`` a no i did not'

like the inventor in calmar inc. v. cook chemical co. part of the graham trilogy once another supplied the key element there was no long-felt need or indeed a problem to be solved by ferguson
the following statement in calmar would apply here with changes only in names and date the [ ferguson ] invention.. rests upon exceedingly small and quite non-technical mechanical differences in a device which was old in the art
at the latest those differences were rendered apparent in [ 1974 ] by the appearance of the [ corcoran_shade_material ] and unsuccessful attempts to reach a solution to the problems confronting [ ferguson ] made before that time became wholly irrelevant
383 u.s. at 36 86 s.ct.at 703
it must also be noted again that the patent_office did not cite the corcoran_shade as prior_art and that newell did not disclose either the corcoran_shade_material or the advertising for the corcoran_shade to the examiner

despite a very strong prima facie case of obviousness established by the evidence newell argues that the district_court was obligated to draw the` inference' of nonobviousness from newells evidence of commercial_success copying by others and other secondary_considerations
these arguments were unpersuasive to the trial_court and are unpersuasive to us
first as indicated obviousness is not a factual inference ; second although these factors must be considered they do not control the obviousness_conclusion

under similar circumstances in ewp_corp. where the record showed that the invention had become` very successful' in the industry,15 this court held

in reaching our conclusion that the invention claimed would have been obvious we have considered the evidence and arguments pertaining to the so-called` secondary_considerations' such as commercial *769 success licensing adoption by the industry etc
upon full consideration of all the evidence we remain convinced that it presents a clear and very strong_case of obviousness based on admissions and the teachings of the new references above considered

in this case as well although the record shows a highly successful product,16 the record also establishes such a strong_case of obviousness based on admissions and the teachings of the prior_art including the improved corcoran tearable shade_material a reference not considered during examination that the objective_evidence of nonobviousness does not persuade us to reach a contrary conclusion
we conclude from the established facts that the district_court committed no legal error in holding that the invention of claim 1 of the770_patent would have been obvious within the meaning of 35 u.s.c.¡± 103.17 thus newell was not improperly deprived of the jurys verdict that the770_patent would not have been obvious

v. kenneys cross-appeal on attorney fees
kenney argues that the court erred in not finding this case` exceptional' within the meaning of 35 u.s.c.¡± 285 1982 and that kenney should have been awarded its reasonable attorney_fees
the basis for kenneys argument is that newell was guilty of inequitable_conduct by failing to disclose corcoran by name as the inventor of the vinyl fabric with invisible tear lines corcorans advertisements in the united_states for his shades and corcorans correspondence with ferguson and in urging that a 1930 patent to rice was the closest prior_art
the district_court held that newells conduct did not rise to the level of inequitable_conduct and that attorney_fees were not warranted in the circumstances of this case
we are not persuaded of factual error or abuse of discretion by the district_court in denying attorney_fees
see reactive metals alloys corp. v. esm inc. 769_f.2d_1578 1582 226_uspq_821 824 fed.cir.1985

newman circuit_judge dissenting
i respectfully dissent from the panel_majoritys change in the right to jury_trial of the question of unobviousness
the full weight of supreme_court and federal_circuit decisions is contrary to their ruling as are the traditions and laws governing jury_verdicts and the constitutional guarantee

the supreme_court has continually recognized the right to jury_trial of the question of invention/unobviousness ; and the federal_circuit has been faithful to and has carried forward this constitutional requirement
we have reaffirmed that jury_verdicts in patent_cases as jury_verdicts in general are reviewed on the reasonable_jury/substantial_evidence_standard not decided de novo by the appellate_court

the panel_majority now holds that it is a violation of rule 49 a to ask the jury the question of unobviousness-and that if the jury nonetheless renders a verdict on the question of unobviousness the most that the verdict is worth is to provide clues as to how the jury viewed the underlying graham_factors
indeed in the case before us the panel_majority holds that although no *770 specific graham findings were made by the jury none were necessary because these factors according to the majority are now undisputed

thus the panel_majority giving` full and independent_review by the court' to the question of unobviousness conducts its own analysis of the prior_art and draws its independent conclusions giving no deference whatsoever to the jury_verdict
despite the jury_trial the jury has disappeared from the decisional process

for an appellate_tribunal to redecide the question of unobviousness without normal_deference to the jurys verdict violates the right of litigants to trial by jury
as stated in raytheon mfg co. v. radio corp. of america 76_f.2d_943 947 1st cir
) affd 296_u.s._459 56_s.ct._297 80_l.ed._327_(1935) neither the congress nor the courts can deprive a litigant of this [ seventh_amendment ] right
we solidly reaffirmed our obedience to this mandate in connell v. sears roebuck & co. 722_f.2d_1542 1547 220_uspq_193 197 fed.cir.1983 no warrant appears for distinguishing the submission of legal questions to a jury in patent_cases from such submissions routinely made in other_types of cases
so long as the seventh_amendment stands the right to a jury_trial should not be rationed nor should particular issues in particular types of cases be treated differently from similar issues in other_types of cases
our treatment of patent_jury_trials like other_jury_trials in accordance with history tradition and law has benefited courts litigants and the vitality of the patent_system
the panel_majority now rejects our precedent that had secured patent_litigation in the mainstream of the judicial system

as the appellate_court receiving appeals from all the district_courts of the nation todays decision moves patent_jury_trials into some undefined limbo unique to patent_litigation
this new and confusing conflict with our own_precedent of constitutional dimension can not reassure the bar or litigants or trial_judges

i
conflict with federal_circuit decisions
the federal_circuit has held time after time that the jury may decide the question of unobviousness
when the right to jury_trial is protected this protection can not be excised by simply allowing or requiring` independent_plenary_review and determination' of the issue by appellate_judges

the deference that courts must give to jury_verdicts by applying the substantial_evidence/reasonable_jury_standard of review is the mechanism by which the seventh_amendment protects the jury_system from encroachment
the federal_circuit in a large body of decision has reviewed jury_verdicts on unobviousness on this established standard
for example the court wrote in orthokinetics inc. v. safety_travel_chairs inc. 806_f.2d_1565 1571 1_uspq2d_1081 1085 fed.cir.1986 if then the district_court is` convinced upon the record before the jury that reasonable persons could not reach or could not have reached a verdict for the non-mover it should grant the motion for directed verdict or for jnov'

all of these decisions are contravened by the ruling of the panel_majority that a jury_verdict on the question of obviousness *772 must receive` plenary' review by the court

the panel_majority proposes that if underlying facts are disputed the court shall infer the jurys factual_findings from the jurys general_verdict and then make on these inferred findings a` full and independent' determination of unobviousness
we are not enlightened as to how to achieve this insight into the jurys mind
at best this procedure requires that which we condemned in american_hoist & derrick_co. 725 f.2d at 1361 220 uspq at 772 a district_court may not solicit only a legal_conclusion from the jury and then act as fact_finder preliminary to expressing agreement with its legal determination

the nature of the verdict requested of the jury is determined by the trial_court in its discretion
the panel_majority suggests that special_interrogatories should be mandatory
but the courts have recognized the difficulty in presenting meaningful special_interrogatories on the many questions raised by multiple prior_art references or complex inventions
see panther_pumps & equipment co. v. hydrocraft inc. 468_f.2d_225 228 175_uspq_577 579 7th_cir.1972 when only two or three narrow issues of fact such as the date of invention or perhaps the date of first public sale determine the issue of patent_validity it may be entirely appropriate to submit special_interrogatories to the jury
but if as in this case one party contends that as many as 32 separate_fact_questions [ on obviousness ] must be resolved the trial_judge certainly may consider it inappropriate to use the special interrogatory procedure
[ footnote omitted ] as the court in panther_pumps observed this matter is within the unreviewable_discretion of the trial_judge
see 9 wright & miller federal_practice and procedure civil 1971 ¡± 2505 whether a special or general_verdict shall be returned rests in the discretion of the trial_court.¡± 2511 the decision whether to use a general_verdict accompanied by special_interrogatories as authorized by rule 49 b is similarly committed to the unreviewable_discretion of the trial_judge
this court agreed in railroad_dynamics 727 f.2d at 1515 220 uspq at 938 district courts have broad authority and discretion in controlling the conduct of a trial
that authority extends to the form by which juries return verdicts fed.r.civ.p
49 and will not be interfered with unless an abuse of discretion is shown
we recognized the opportunity for prejudice resulting from the compulsory use of interrogatories stating in weinar 744 f.2d at 809 223 uspq at 376 [ s ] ubmission of interrogatories is not in all cases an unmixed blessing
the decision to submit interrogatories and the precise language in which they are couched can have an untoward effect on a verdict if certain elements of the trial or the evidence are thereby overly emphasized in the jurys mind
the majority creates a fresh conflict with these decisions in favoring the submission of interrogatories or` mandatory_alternative_instructions' to the jury
op. note 8
a` mandatory alternative instruction' would instruct the jury how it must decide the ultimate_question based on every combination of factual_findings that the jury might make
for the panther_pumps example of thirty-two separate_fact_questions the number of such combinations of findings is two to the thirty-second power or 4,294,967,296.1 such instructions even where feasible inevitably presume the judges conclusion and could prejudice the jurys verdict
professor moore remarked

the notion that issues of` fact' are easily framed is unsound
and the jury is not nor should it become a scientific fact *773 finding body
its chief value is that it applies the` law' oftentimes a body of technical and refined theoretical principles and sometimes edged with harshness in an earthy fashion that comports with` justice' as conceived by the masses for whom after all the law is mainly meant to serve
moores federal_rules note to rule 49 p. 1148 1949 quoted in s. driver the special verdict-theory and practice 26_wash.l.rev._21 23 1951
the panel_majority imposes on the trial_courts a procedure that is unique to patents untested and difficult to administer
as stated by h.t
markey in on simplifying patent trials 116_f.r.d._369 370 1987 there is neither reason nor authority for employing in a patent trial procedures and practices different from those employed in any other civil trial
indeed reason and authority mandate the contrary
chief judge markey continued the analysis to say that a jury may never decide a question of law is to read out of existence rule 49 b providing for general_verdicts and rule 51 providing for instructions on the law as well as to render meaningless all the rules developed for handling conflicts between the fact findings and the ultimate_legal_conclusion reached by the jury on its way to its general_verdict
facile phrases like` facts are for the jury ; law is for the court' appear nowhere in the rules
id.at 371-72

we have regularly admonished ourselves to apply the proper standard of review and that an appellate panel is not entitled to` reverse the finding of the trier of fact simply because it is convinced that it would have decided the case differently'
anderson v. bessemer city 470_u.s._564 573 105_s.ct._1504 1511 84_l.ed.2d_518_(1985)
the reason is self-explanatory when as in the case here appealed the appellate_tribunal did not hear the testimony observe the witnesses see the demonstrations listen to explanations of the prior_art and the claims learn what was the state of this art at the time in question or analyze the long-felt need and commercial_impact
appellate briefs and selections from the record can not duplicate the events of trial

heretofore this court has respected the constitutionally protected tradition of jury_trial
indeed were the court in doubt any doubt must be resolved in favor of the jury tradition maintenance of the jury as a fact-finding body is of such importance and occupies so firm a place in our history and jurisprudence that any seeming curtailment of the right to a jury_trial should be scrutinized with the utmost care
dimick v. schiedt 293_u.s._474 486 55_s.ct._296 301 79_l.ed._603_(1935)

in stark contrast is the ruling now offered contravening all of these decisions holding that when the facts are` established'` the trial_courts conclusion on obviousness is subject to full and independent_review by this court' op.at 762 ; the jury_verdict is disregarded for` it is not the function of the jury to pick and choose among established facts relating to obviousness'
op.at 763
this holding can not be squared with protected jury_verdicts
it also violates supreme_court precedent as i shall discuss in part ii post

in the case before us the panel_majority does not mention the jury instructions or whether a reasonable_jury could have reached the verdict of unobviousness it here reached or whether there was substantial_evidence before the jury to support its verdict of unobviousness
nor does the panel_majority discuss what facts the jury is presumed to have found holding instead that` the facts' are undisputed on appeal
the panel_majority thus has analyzed the prior_art afresh found the differences from the patented invention used the district_courts finding of the level of ordinary_skill and stated that it gives no weight to the evidence of long-felt need and commercial_success ; all entirely independent of the jury

*774 discarded is the presumption that the jury considered the evidence before it see dmi inc. v. deere & co. 802 f.2d at 425 231 uspq at 279 [ the jurys ] answer.. on obviousness must in light of the instructions it received [ on the graham_factors ] be taken as establishing that the jury considered them
and discarded in the reasonable_jury/substantial_evidence_standard of review of the jurys verdict
our precedent which has uniformly authorized litigants to take the issue of obviousness to a jury of citizens is contravened

ii
the constitutional issue
the seventh_amendment2 right to jury_trial and to jury_verdict that receives the deference normally due to jury_verdicts derives from the traditional right to trial of the issue at common_law
where this right exists it may not be taken away by a court even indirectly-such as by relabeling a traditional jury question as one of pure_law severed from its factual_components ; or by allowing the jury to find historical_facts while removing from the jury the verdict on the ultimate_question
the supreme_court stated in walker v. new mexico & so
pac
r. co. 165_u.s._593 596 17_s.ct._421 422 41_l.ed._837_(1897)

the seventh_amendment.. requires that questions of fact in common_law actions shall be settled by a jury and that the court shall not assume directly or indirectly to take from the jury or to itself such prerogative
the court has frequently reinforced this fundamental right
the seventh_amendment preserves the right to jury_trial of issues that were decided by jury at english common_law at the time the amendment was adopted in 1791
dimick v. schiedt 293_u.s._474 476 55_s.ct._296 297 79_l.ed._603_(1935) ; fleming right to a jury_trial in civil actions 72 yale l.j
655 655 1963
in considering applicability of the seventh_amendment we need not resolve whether the question of unobviousness in modern analysis should be classified as a question of fact or law or any combination thereof ; we determine only whether its jury determination partakes of constitutional protection

pre-1791 english patent jury cases treated the issue of invention as one of fact for the jury
see e.g. bramah v. hardcastle kings bench n.p. trin.t. 1789 his lordship concluded with telling the jury the patent was void the invention not being new ; and that they should find a verdict for the defendant
verdict was given for the plaintiff however and was not disturbed
rex v. arkwright kings bench n.p. june_25,_1785 butler j. gentlemen of the jury.. as to the other points there are two first whether it is a new invention.. [ i ] n the case of an invention many parts of a machine may have been known before yet if there be anything material and new which is an improvement of the trade that will be sufficient to support a patent.. arkwright v. nightingale common pleas n.p. feb._17,_1785 charge to jury discussing requirements for patentability ; morris v. bramsom kings bench n.p. 1776 jury_trial of an action for infringement including defense that the patent` was only for an addition to an old machine'

the continuing right to a jury_trial was implemented in the united_states
patent cases were tried at law to a jury when damages were requested and at equity to the court when injunction or other equitable relief was requested
in the quite large number of reported actions at law juries gave verdicts on questions of patent_validity including novelty invention prior use or sale derivation and sufficiency of disclosure as well as on infringement and *775 damages ; all questions that arose and still arise in patent_cases.3

there is an overwhelming volume of precedent holding that the issues of invention as unobviousness was called before 1952 and novelty often used to include invention see curtis law of patents 4th ed
1873 ¡± 445 are questions for the jury
see e.g. the following supreme_court cases citations and footnotes omitted

hotchkiss v. greenwood 52 u.s. 11 how
248 264-65 267 13_l.ed._683_(1851) the court.. [ properly ] charged the jury that if [ inter_alia ] no more ingenuity or skill [ was ] required to construct the knob in this way than that possessed by an ordinary mechanic acquainted with the business the patent was invalid and the plaintiffs were not entitled to a verdict
... now if the foregoing view of the improvement claimed in this patent be correct it is quite apparent that there was no error in the submission of the questions presented at the trial to the jury.. battin v. taggert 58 u.s. 17 how
74 85 15_l.ed._37_(1854) the jury are also to judge of the novelty of the invention.. turrill v. railroad co. 68 u.s. 1 wall
491 512 17_l.ed._668_(1863) [ t ] here was an important question of fact which should have been left to the jury whether.. any of the prior movable press-blocks as is shown in the admission were substantially the same as the machine of the patentee
american authorities at least hold that every such_question is one for the jury.. bischoff v. wethered 76 u.s. 9 wall
812 814-15 19_l.ed._829_(1869) [ in ] all such cases [ where court sets verdict aside as against the weight of evidence ] the question would still be treated as a question of fact for the jury and not as a question of law for the court
and under this rule of practice counsel would not have the right to require the court as matter of law to pronounce upon the identity or diversity of the several inventions described in the patents produced
such we think has been the prevailing rule in this country and we see no sufficient reason for changing it
stimpson v. woodman 77 u.s. 10 wall
117 125 19_l.ed._866_(1869) clifford j. dissenting [ b ] ut the question whether a particular invention is new and useful or whether it did require any invention to produce it as compared with what existed before are everywhere admitted to be questions of fact for the jury and certainly no such_question is open here for the determination of this court under this bill of exceptions
tucker v. spalding 80 u.s. 13 wall
453 455 20_l.ed._515_(1871) whatever may be our personal opinions of the fitness of the jury as a tribunal to determine the diversity or identity in principle of two mechanical instruments.. that question must be submitted to the jury if there is so much resemblance as raises the question at all
and though the principles by which the question must be decided may be very largely propositions of law it still remains the essential nature of the jury_trial that while the court may on this mixed question of law and fact lay down to the jury the law which should govern them so as to guide them to truth and guard them against error and may if they disregard instructions set aside *776 their verdict the ultimate response to the question must come from the jury
keyes v. grant 118_u.s._25 36-37 6_s.ct._974 980-981 30_l.ed._54_(1886) [ whether differences from the prior_art ] would not require the exercise of the faculty of invention but would be suggested by the skill of an experienced workman.. was a question of fact properly to be left for determination to the jury under suitable instructions from the court upon the rules of law which should guide them to their verdict
and there was evidence upon both sides of the issue sufficient to require that it should be weighed and considered by the jury in the determination of the question.. adams v. bellaire stamping co. 141_u.s._539 541-42 12_s.ct._66 67 35_l.ed._849_(1891) on the trial special questions were submitted to the jury and they found [ inter_alia ] that the irwin patent disclosed no improvement which required invention as distinguished from mere_mechanical_skill or judgment.. thomson spot welder co. v. ford motor co. 265_u.s._445 446 44_s.ct._533 534 68_l.ed._1098_(1924) the question whether an improvement requires mere_mechanical_skill or the exercise of the faculty of invention is one of fact ; and in an action at law for infringement is to be left to the determination of the jury
the supreme_court has recognized the role of the directed verdict as appropriate in patent as in other_jury_trials when the criteria are met ; e.g. heald v. rice 104_u.s._737 749 26_l.ed._910_(1881) ; fond du lac county v. may 137_u.s._395 403 11_s.ct._98 100 34_l.ed._714_(1890) ; market street cable ry co. v. rowley 155_u.s._621 625 15_s.ct._224 226 39_l.ed._284_(1895) ; singer mfg co. v. cramer 192_u.s._265 275 24_s.ct._291 295 48_l.ed._437_(1904)
the court has also referred to the complexity of these jury questions and defined them as questions of ultimate_fact on which depends the question of legal_liability

united_states v. esnault-pelterie 299_u.s._201 205 57_s.ct._159 161-62 81_l.ed._123_(1936) validity and infringement are ultimate_facts on which depends the question of liability
in actions at law they are to be decided by the jury
if the evidence is not sufficient to establish validity and infringement it is the duty of the trial_court to direct a verdict for defendant
united gas public service co. v. texas 303_u.s._123 140 58_s.ct._483 491-92 82_l.ed._702_(1938) cases at law triable by a jury in the federal courts often involve most difficult and complex questions as for example in patent_cases at law presenting issues of validity and infringement
the supreme_court unequivocally established that when the question of invention has been placed at issue and tried to a jury neither the trial_court nor any appellate_court decides the question of validity or infringement de novo independent of the jury_verdict
the courts have no power to remove the constitutionally protected benefits of a jury_trial

the district and circuit courts implemented the general_rule that invention in actions at law is determined by the jury
the rare exception points up the great weight of this jurisprudence
a representative sampling includes hall v. wiles 11_f.cas._280 283 s.d.n.y.1851 no._5954` the question of whether the patented carriage is a new improvement is one of fact.. and except that there are some legal principles bearing on the question of fact and as to which the court may aid you it is a question which must be determined by the good sense and sound judgment of the jury' ; poppenhusen v. falke 19_f.cas._1052 1054 s.d.n.y.1862 no._11280` the question whether [ the patented device ] required invention or not was one to be submitted to the jury' ; holmes v. truman 67_f._542 543 9th cir.1895 trial_court correctly refused to instruct the jury that there was no invention in the plaintiffs cart

*777 see also heide v. panoulias 188_f._914 917 2d cir.1911` the trial_judge would have committed error had he decided these questions of validity and infringement instead of sending them to the jury' ; fountain electrical floor box corp. v. trustees of masonic hall and asylum fund 210_f._169 171-72 s.d.n.y.1913 jury finding of invention depends on the language and meaning and construction of a number of patents and the varying evidence of experts ; general motors corp. v. california research corp. 9_f.r.d._565 567 83_uspq_282 283-84 d.del.1949 validity and infringement are clearly ultimate_facts and may be determined by a jury ; reynolds-southwestern corp. v. dresser industries inc. 372_f.2d_592 595 152_uspq_530 532 5th cir.1967 validity and infringement are ultimate_facts to be decided by the jury
if the evidence is not sufficient to establish validity and infringement the trial_court must direct a verdict for the defendant

) cert
denied 238_u.s._626 35_s.ct._664 59_l.ed._1495_(1915) where no controversy on the prior_art or the meaning of the claims the question of invention becomes one of law for the court ; swofford v. b & w inc. 395_f.2d_362 364-68 158_uspq_72 76 5th cir

in 1952 the three basic conditions of patentability were codified in three separate sections of title 35-the requirement of utility in section 101 the requirement of novelty in section 102 and the requirement of non-obviousness in section 103
codification does not of course supersede the seventh_amendment
the supreme_court in graham v. john_deere_co. 383_u.s._1 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545 148_uspq_459_(1966) a non-jury_trial recognized that these requirements have existed since the adoption of the constitution
the court wrote innovation advancement and things which add to the sum of useful knowledge are inherent requisites in a patent_system which by constitutional command must` promote the progress of.. useful arts'
this is the standard expressed in the constitution and it may not be ignored
[ emphasis in original ]
383 u.s. at 6 86 s.ct.at 688 148 uspq at 462
the federal_circuit early made clear our respect for supreme_court and constitutional mandate reaffirming that it is not error to submit the question of obviousness among other patent issues for jury_verdict ; see part i ante

it is not available to two judges of this court to overrule two centuries of constitutional_right simply by redefining a protected jury question as one of pure_law independent of its factual_components proposing thereby to remove the question from jury_verdict
in the case at bar the litigants have the right to have the question of obviousness decided by the jury and to have the jury_verdict reviewed on the established substantial_evidence/reasonable_jury_standard
that right has been denied by the panel_majority who instead applied their new_standard of review and on that standard found the ferguson_patent invalid for obviousness.4

iii
the proposed reclassification of unobviousness as a question of pure law
the justification for the panel_majoritys` plenary' determination of a question that was tried to and decided by the jury is that the question of obviousness is one of pure_law severable from and severed from its factual_components
holding that the jury can not` pick and choose among established facts' op.at 763 the panel_majority has analyzed the prior_art determined the differences evaluated the objective_evidence *778 weighed its significance and then decided the question of obviousness as a matter of` law'

this classification depends for its sole authority on our cases reviewing bench_trials not jury_trials
thus our holding in panduit_corp. v. dennison_mfg co. 810_f.2d_1561 1566-68 1_uspq2d_1593 1595-97 fed.cir
) cert
denied 481_u.s._1052 107_s.ct._2187 95_l.ed.2d_843_(1987) a bench_trial is discovered to present a conflict with our lengthy precedent governing review of jury_verdicts a conflict said to be reconcilable only if the jury_verdict is stripped of its authority

as i shall discuss it is not controlling whether unobviousness is most precisely designated as a question of law based on underlying facts as the federal_circuit prefers or as a question of ultimate_fact based on historical_facts as the commentators like to call such mixed_questions of law and fact.5 the right to jury_trial of the question is protected by the seventh_amendment and does not lose this protection by changing the label

scholars have pointed out that the law/fact distinction is both difficult and unnecessary to make in the context of a jury_verdict for the jury necessarily applies law to facts
1 s. childress and m. davis standards of review p. 194 1986 [ hereinafter childress ] [ t ] he point is that submitting the case to the jurors means that they necessarily apply law as they find facts and in that function something of a lawmaking process develops that belies a simple breakdown of fact as the jurys turf while law belongs to judges
indeed the federal_circuit early recognized the point
in railroad_dynamics 727 f.2d at 1514-15 220 uspq at 937 the court stated [ a ] jury necessarily reaches a legal_conclusion presumably in accord with the judges instructions on the law before it reaches its general_verdict
moreover it is idle to speak of the jury solely as fact_finder so long as instructions on the law and general_verdicts remain elements of a jury_trial
when and if rules 49 50 and 51 fed.r.civ.p. are repealed there may be room for the restriction of juries to a fact finding role and for prohibition of general_verdicts in patent or other_types of jury_trials
until that day a prohibition of general_verdicts and disregard of the findings and legal_conclusions a jury must make in reaching those verdicts can not be accomplished by judicial fiat
this practice of the federal_circuit has been in full harmony with appellate treatment of jury_trials of complex issues
as louis infra summarizes it categories variously referred to as` application of the law to the facts' or` ultimate_facts' do not thereby change their entitlement to jury_verdict and to appropriate deference on review ultimate facts going to the merits are usually reviewed [ from jury_verdicts ] narrowly and deferentially like questions of historical_fact even when the underlying historical_facts are not in dispute
indeed with the exception of a few specific substantive areas like constitutional and contract or commercial law mixed_questions going to the merits are almost presumptively classified as question of fact assigned to the jury and reviewed narrowly on appeal from any fact_finder

( quoting thayer a preliminary treatise on evidence 193 1898

the law of obviousness the general_rule in all cases is set in 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 ¡± 103
conditions for patentability ; non-obvious subject_matter
a patent may not be obtained though the invention is not identically disclosed or described as set forth in section 102 of this title if the differences between the subject_matter sought to be patented and the prior_art are such that the subject_matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary_skill in the art to which said subject_matter_pertains
patentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which the invention was made

the rule of section 103 has been elaborated by the courts as a matter of judge-made law
for example the courts have established the rule that synergism is not a requirement for unobviousness of combination inventions ; the rule that a structurally obvious chemical compound that exhibits unexpected properties may be deemed unobvious ; the rule that objective_indicia must be considered along with the other graham_factors ; all these rules comprising a common_law of unobviousness

but these rules do not establish how the evidence as to any specific case will be weighed or which technological or commercial facts will support a ruling of unobviousness and which will not
the conclusion of unobviousness vel non is not dictated as a matter of law ; it is reached by weighing and evaluating the facts of the particular_case
we have long recognized the fact-dependency of obviousness_determinations
see e.g. in re durden 763_f.2d_1406 1410 226_uspq_359 361 fed.cir.1985 we reiterate another principle followed in obviousness issue cases which is to decide each case on the basis of its own particular fact situation
what we or our predecessors may have said in discussing different fact situations is not to be taken as having universal application
the conclusion is not severable from the underlying facts of the particular_case but is determined by the weighing and evaluation of these facts by the trier of fact through the eye of the person that the trier of fact has found to be of ordinary_skill in the technology

misperception of this process may have arisen because the evidence in obviousness_determinations is often documentary prior_art whose existence is unchallenged often readable by judges usually included in appellate records
although credibility of documentary evidence is not often at issue the corollary for technological information is its evaluation and weight ; along with all other evidence
see richdel inc. v. sunspool corp. 714_f.2d_1573 1580 219_uspq_8 12 fed.cir.1983` the issue is the obviousness of the claimed invention and that issue can be resolved only after all relevant evidence of nonobviousness including so-calledsecondary_considerations if any has been taken into account'
( emphasis original
even when the existence of the prior_art is undisputed the *780 weighing of the evidentiary_factors may be highly disputed as in the case at bar
the weight of these factors is not severable from the factors themselves and is not assigned to a different decision-maker
see the discussion in louis supra at 1033 of` the virtually settled rule that mixed_questions can not be taken from the jury simply because the historical_facts are not in dispute'

the jury applies the law of unobviousness on which it has been instructed by the court to all the evidence in light of the burden of proof and determines the ultimate_question of whether the requirements of section 103 are met
thereafter in accord with federal_circuit precedent appellate review of the jury_verdict is limited to whether the applicable legal principles were identified and applied correctly and whether the findings of ultimate_fact exceed the limits of reasonableness
louis supra at 999

the question of sufficiency of the evidence may be raised on motion for directed verdict and the trial_court may decide that as a matter of law the evidence is insufficient to create an issue for resolution by the jury when all inferences are drawn in favor of the non-movant

see generally w._blume origin and development of the directed_verdict 48_mich.l.rev._555_(1950)

the panel_majority appears to confuse the question of sufficiency of evidence which is a matter of law with the status of the ultimate_question which may be historical_fact or ultimate_fact based on historical_fact or a mixed_law-fact question of various labels

b
bench trials and jury_trials
courts and commentators generally have rejected proposals that modern juries should be limited to special verdicts of narrow historical_facts and denied the verdict on the ultimate_question
as discussed in childress with respect to the question of negligence it is the trier of fact who has seen the evidence and heard the witnesses and determined who is the` ordinary person' and is best capable of determining what such a person would have done or should reasonably have done in the specific situation that existed
childress supra at 141 treating negligence as fact is the usual course even among courts that call it a mixed_law-fact_issue apparently recognizing that whatever the policies supporting deference negligence presents a classic_example of applying a legal_standard normally reasonableness to established facts in determining a conclusion of legal_liability
the supreme_court has made plain that it is the jury that applies the legal_standard of reasonableness
see e.g. wilkerson v. mccarthy 336_u.s._53 62 69_s.ct._413 417-18 93_l.ed._497_(1949) we see no reason so long as the jury_system is the law of the land and the jury is made the tribunal to decide disputed questions of fact why it should not decide such_questions as these [ negligence ] as well as others
( quoting jones v. east tennessee r. co. 128_u.s._443 445 9_s.ct._118 118-119 32_l.ed._478_(1888)

precedent illustrates the analogous application by the jury of the legal_standard of the person of ordinary_skill to the facts of the prior_art
see parts i and ii ante
whether classified as mixed_law-fact as law based on fact or as ultimate_fact the question of unobviousness may be decided by the jury
when so decided it is reviewed on the usual reasonable juror/substantial_evidence_standard.6

*781 the panel_majoritys proposed` full and independent' determination of the question of unobviousness does no damage if applied to review of a bench_trial wherein the district_courts decision is accompanied by the detailed findings and conclusions of rule 52 a
childress supra at 194 explains that a judges ruling after a bench_trial involving interdependent questions of law and fact may indeed be reviewed more freely than a jurys verdict on the same issue that application of law to facts is the jurys job and on appeal it is generally not questioned in the same way that a judges findings on a bench_trial appeal under federal_rule of civil_procedure 52 a might be called mixed_law-fact and then split into the component parts with the law part going more freely to the reviewing court
in this way the law-fact_issue in jury_trials is more a process than a rude dichotomy
in the process some issues called mixed_law-fact in bench_trials-and often reviewed more freely there-are unquestionably submitted to the jury
negligence is the classic_example.. [ emphasis in original footnote omitted ] the standard of review of the jury_verdict does not lose its requisite deference merely because a bench_trial would be reviewed more freely
neither constitution nor statutes preclude the courts from applying different rules to the findings of fact of trial_judges from those applied to the findings of juries.. stern review of findings of administrators judges and juries a comparative analysis 58_harv.l.rev._70 83 86 1944

thus the traditional role of the jury in patent_cases was undisturbed by our holding in panduit_corp. 810 f.2d at 1566-68 1 uspq2d at 1595-97 that unobviousness is a conclusion of law based on facts
panduit did not eliminate decision of the ultimate_question of obviousness by jury_verdict or change the standard of appellate_review
indeed to hold otherwise would place us in direct_conflict with the seventh_amendment a situation not intended by this court

c. the better administration of justice
the supreme_court has reemphasized the special role of the trier of fact as being in the better position to decide questions that have been fully explored by the trial process
the court discussed the importance of the sound_administration of justice in deciding which tribunal is better positioned to decide mixed_questions of law and fact
pierce v. underwood 487_u.s._552 108_s.ct._2541 2547 101_l.ed.2d_490_(1988) we recently observed with regard to the problem of determining whether mixed_questions of law and fact are to be treated as questions of law or of fact for purposes of appellate_review that sometimes the decision` has turned on a determination that as a matter of the sound_administration of justice one judicial actor is better positioned than another to decide the issue in question'
miller v. fenton 474_u.s._104 114 106_s.ct._445 452 88_l.ed.2d_405_(1985)
even if an appellate_court could give adequate attention to a case that occupied weeks or months of trial time it can not be preferable to require` full and independent' redetermination by trial and appellate_judges of the question that the jury decided
the principle of granting a certain deference on review of a jurys verdict is founded in practicality as well as logic

in all events however the question of obviousness is classified there is an inalienable right to jury_trial of the issue
the panel_majority holds again generating conflict with our own_precedent that the federal_rules do not permit asking the jury the question of nonobviousness
while the procedural rules have changed over the years since 1791 the constitution *782 continues to protect the substantive right to a jury_trial on protected issues
the` right' which is secured by the seventh_amendment is not a matter of procedure but of substance and one possessing such right can not be deprived of it by any means short of an amendment to the constitution
minneapolis & st. louis r.r
co. v. bombolis 241_u.s._211 213 36_s.ct._595 60_l.ed._961_(1916)
rule 49 is not a vehicle for defeating a constitutionally protected right to jury_trial

i have not discussed the pertinence to patent_litigation of the deep-seated faith that free peoples place in the jury_system
see e.g. hill the right to a jury_trial in complex litigation in` 1980 patent law annual ; the southwestern legal foundation' new york matthew bender 1980 261 275.. we should be careful that we do not materially trespass on perhaps the most outstanding feature of the jury_system-the right of our citizens through the system to inject their common sense of justice into our judicial decisions which can and often do affect the jurors daily lives as well as those of the litigants
every alternative should be fully explored before disenfranchising a litigants cherished right to a jury_trial and our citizens right to have a part in making the law which governs them
it is this right that was secured by the seventh_amendment
it is not ours to defeat

iv
the presumption of validity
i must also dissent from the panel_majoritys rejection of the presumption of validity in obviousness_determinations
the majority holds that only` the disputed facts underlying the legal_conclusion must be established by clear and convincing_evidence not the ultimate_legal_conclusion of obviousness itself'
panel op.at 767

the requirement of clear and convincing_evidence of invalidity is grounded on the statutory presumption of validity 35 u.s.c.¡± 282
the presumption arises from the patent_offices final_decision to grant the patent the examination that not only finds the prior_art but weighs and evaluates the technological and objective_evidence based on scientific experience and legal expertise
american_hoist & derrick 725 f.2d at 1358-59 220 uspq at 770
included in the examination is review of all evidentiary_factors pertinent to 35 u.s.c.¡± 103
thus the presumption is based not only on the identification of prior_art and the differences from the claimed invention but on the administrative decision of unobviousness
it is curious indeed to hold that only the former administrative actions are entitled to its benefit accepting the expertise of the examiner as searcher but not as evaluator

the question of obviousness is the most frequently litigated argument for patent invalidity
see note a proposal to view patent claim nonobviousness from the policy perspective of federal_rule of civil_procedure 52 a 20_mich.j.l.ref._1157 1158-59 1987 citing 3 chisum patents ¡± 11.06 [ 3 ] [ c ] at 11-102
the evidentiary burden of clear and convincing_evidence has been imposed in literally hundreds of such decisions based on federal_circuit requirement
the panel_majority by undertaking for itself to determine unobviousness in the first instance simply places the appellate_tribunal in the role of patent_examiner bringing the judges technological and scientific expertise to bear giving no deference to that of the patent_examiner

in the case before us the jury was instructed that kenney had the burden of proving invalidity of the ferguson_patent by clear and convincing_evidence
by changing the weight of this burden the panel_majority creates another conflict with our precedent

v. validity of the ferguson770_patent
the verdict here at issue wherein the jury held that the ferguson770_patent had not been proved invalid must be reviewed on the established standard for the court *783 has not in banc changed the law governing appellate_review of jury_verdicts

on a partys motion for judgment n.o.v
( or for directed verdict as here the trial_judge may grant the motion
only when without weighing the credibility of the evidence there can be but one reasonable conclusion as to the proper judgment ; and in doing so the court
must view the evidence in the light and with all reasonable_inferences most favorable to the party who secured the jury_verdict

this litigation reported at newell_companies inc. v. kenney_mfg co. 606_f.supp._1282 226_uspq_157_(d.r.i.1985) is about commercial rights to the do-it-yourself-without-tools_window_shade a device of solid practicality
the jury was advised-as may have been common knowledge-that the previous way of obtaining window_shades was to take your measurements to a hardware store where a clerk would saw cut glue and staple the components to fit your measurements ; the customer often returning to the store for a repeat attempt
the district_court stated` until the time of the claimed invention store-cut shades were the state of the art'
id.at 1286 226 uspq at 158
newell found a way to avoid all this a simple way ; a new way as kenney has acknowledged

the ferguson invention is not a feat of engineering
it is a simple kit whereby a householder without tools can easily fit a shade to his/her own window of any width and height
it was a smashing success
it bumped from the shelves of k-mart the entire paraphernalia that householders had previously been condemned to
and the manufacturers of that paraphernalia having once rejected fergusons invitation to make the do-it-yourself-without-tools product rushed to copy it
id.at 1286-87 226 uspq at 159

the scope of the patent claims is quite narrow
they are not simply to a combination of old shade and old roller but to a detailed specific novel combination of all the elements of a shade that is` width adjustable and installable by the consumer without the use of tools or cutting elements'

that a claimed invention is simple easy to understand or a narrow technological advance does not foreclose patentability

the question before the jury was whether kenney had proved by clear and convincing_evidence that the claimed combination would have been obvious to a person of ordinary_skill in that field
the jury answered the question` no'

the jury may have given substantial weight to the objective_indicia of commercial_success copying long-felt need and failure of others for these aspects in this case were of exceptional force
such indicia reflecting the contemporaneous reaction of those affected by the invention give counterweight to judicial hindsight
graham v. john_deere_co. 383_u.s._1 36 86_s.ct._684 703 15_l.ed.2d_545 148_uspq_459 474 1966 quoting monroe auto equipment co. v. heckethorn mfg

[ citation omitted ] the speed with which this industry that the district_court described as` sluggish' moved to copy the ferguson_shade when *784 its commercial value became apparent may have been significant to the jury

the district_court granted kenneys motion for directed verdict and held the claims invalid for obviousness
we as the appellate_tribunal do not decide independently whether the window_shade was obvious or unobvious we decide only whether a reasonable_jury could have reached the verdict that was reached in accordance with the established standard of review of jury_verdicts
thus i have reviewed whether a reasonable_jury could have reached the verdict that invalidity of the770_patent had not been proved by clear and convincing_evidence and i have reached a conclusion contrary to that of the panel_majority-their conclusion being based on their new_standard of independent determination of the issue on the prior_art

the trial
the jury_trial took nine days
the trial_judge correctly instructed the jury as to the law of 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 with thorough explanation of what factors the law required the jury to consider

the following extracts from the multi-page instructions show the care with which the jury was instructed

obviousness
there are three tests which must be considered in determining whether an invention is obvious 1
what was known in the field of window_shade_manufacture and design at the time the invention was made ; 2
how the claim you are considering is different from what was known in the field of window_shade_manufacture and design at the time the invention was made and
3
the level of ordinary_skill in the making of window_shades
in addition to the three tests of obviousness you should consider evidence of the following factors in your determination of obviousness 1
commercial success or lack thereof ; 2
long felt but unfulfilled need for the product ; and
3
failure of others to develop the product
obviousness is not determined by the use of hindsight the fact that something seems simple to you now does not mean that it was simple at the time it was invented
you must decide the issue of obviousness solely on the basis of what was known by a person with ordinary_skill in the art of making window_shades at the time of the invention
you must not decide this issue on the basis of what is known now ; that is on the basis of hindsight
the court instructed the jury concerning the meaning and application of the graham_factors
illustrative of the instructions concerning the graham_factors are the detailed instructions as to the level of skill in determining the level of ordinary_skill in the art you should first determine whether there was a number of people who regularly worked to solve the type of problem that the invention solved and if so determine the level of ordinary_skill of such people at the time the invention was made
you must consider the level of skill as to the time the invention was made
among the factors that may be considered in your determination are 1 the various ways that others sought to solve the problems existing ; 2 the types of problems encountered ; 3 the rapidity with which new inventions are made in this art ; 4 the sophistication of the technology involved ; and
( 5 the educational background of those actively working in the field
neither party has asserted that there was error in the law that the jury was told to apply including the question presented of whether the defendant
has proven by clear and convincing_evidence that any of the claims of plaintiffs770_patent are invalid because they are obvious..
if yes list claim numbers.. *785 we do not decide whether the trial_judge or an appellate_tribunal could reasonably have reached the independent conclusion that the claims were invalid for obviousness
lavender v. kurn 327_u.s._645 653 66_s.ct._740 744 90_l.ed._916 1946 it is` immaterial that the court might draw a contrary inference or feel that another conclusion is more reasonable'
the only question is whether a reasonable_jury could have held as this jury did that the challenger kenney had failed to show obviousness of any claims by clear and convincing_evidence
perkin-elmer_corp. 732 f.2d at 893 221 uspq at 673

the evidence before the jury included the following

prior art
the jury was told of the close prior_art ; that the corcoran scored shade_material was prior_art and was acknowledged in the specification ; and that adjustable-width rollers were part of the prior_art
witnesses explained to the jury that the rice patent described a telescoping roller for use with standard i.e
non-tearable shade_material and that the gossling468 and gossling944_patent s disclosed telescoping rollers to which a standard shade is affixed by various adhesive_means.7

there was testimony that ferguson made a new product ; and kenneys own expert witness donofrio testified as to the differences between fergusons invention and the prior_art
witnesses also testified that none of the attachment means or adhesive_means disclosed in the prior_art was specifically adapted to adjusting and installing a shade without tools
see the trial testimony of newells expert witness bushnell q
... how would you characterize tom_fergusons patent on his do it yourself without tools_window_shade ?
a
well this product apparently has no real antecedent
there was never a product from the testimony ive heard here today and from the prior patents ive seen that had a roll up window_shade that was able to be sized at home without the aid of tools
kenneys engineer paul comeau agreed that the ferguson_shade was` a very different shade' than he had seen
in its analysis the district_court agreed that` no item of prior_art teaches a tear shade mounted on a telescoping roller by adhesive_means'
606 f.supp.at 1293 226 uspq at 164

prosecution history
it was explained to the jury that the examiner had twice rejected the claims citing prior_art references and also objecting that the claims as filed were too broad
the examiner would not allow the claims until they were amended to include the critical limitation that the shade assembly` is width adjustable and installable by the consumer without the use of tools or cutting elements'

level of skill
the parties agreed that this device did not require complex engineering skills
the district_court found that` a technical background not necessarily amounting to a college degree in engineering' was the only reasonable_jury finding on the level of skill and concluded that this person [ of ordinary_skill ] would be capable of designing a shade such as the one described in vincent sordillos memo
newell 606 f.supp.at 1294 226 uspq at 165
the district_court was referring to a private memorandum of a kenney_employee
the court recognized that this memorandum was not part of the prior_art although the court apparently drew inferences adverse to newell from this abandoned idea and did not discuss whether the jury could have drawn other inferences favorable to newell such as why a person` capable of designing a shade' in the district_courts words did not do so
see standard *786 oil co. v. american cyanamid co. 774_f.2d_448 454 227_uspq_293 298 fed.cir.1985

the jury may have given weight to the undisputed fact that despite the availability of the corcoran_shade_material and the other prior_art the accused infringer did not make this innovation criticized its value and then rushed to copy it

objective indicia
the district_court recognized the outstanding public acceptance of the claimed shade but dismissed the considerable_evidence of commercial_success and copying saying that` such copying does not equal nonobviousness of the claimed invention'
newell 606 f.supp.at 1296 226 uspq at 167
the record shows extensive uncontradicted evidence before the jury in many instances the testimony of kenneys own witnesses of commercial_success copying long-felt need and failure of others

1
commercial success and long-felt need
william uecker senior vice president for kenney testified that the market for window_shades had been altered by this new shade which he foresaw as taking half the window_shade market q
did you foresee any impact in the cut-in-store shades for example by virtue of this do-it-yourself shade ?
a. i saw that and probably still do that the market for stock window_shades will end up about fifty percent of what we call the cut window_shades and fifty percent of what we call the adjustable_window_shades

john donofrio kenneys design expert agreed with the testimony of uecker q
... now do you agree mr. donofrio with the deposition testimony that was read in of mr._uecker that tom_fergusons do it yourself without tools_window_shade was a significant step forward in the window_shade_art ?
a
yes
q
and do you agree with mr._ueckers testimony that there was really nothing like it before ?
a
yes

g. dickson kenney defendants president discussed the demand in the marketplace for the newell_shade and kenneys loss of customers q
now how did you first learn that that there was this demand in the marketplace ?
a
several companies had come to kenney and requested that we develop a product similar on their behalf.. and we were aware that there had been some limited limited successes on the part of newell and clopay in switching certain customers from the so-called conventional shade to the size-at-home and some of these people that switched early in the process were kenney customers on other products
mr. kenney testified that millions of dollars were involved
mr. wright operations manager for kenney stated that a reason kenney entered the do-it-yourself-without-tools_window_shade market was because k-mart had switched to that product

mr. fallin the president of newells window_shade furnishings division stated that fergusons shade was` about as new as you could get at that time' q
would you describe tom_fergusons do it yourself without tools_window_shade as an improvement on what had gone before ?
a
well it was more than an improvement because it really changed the method of marketing this product line so it was about as new as you could get at that time
fallin testified concerning the immediate success of the do-it-yourself shade well from the very beginning the product started selling
we had a success from the first test store and the sales continued to climb ever since
its never peaked
its been a real success story.. fallin like kenneys witnesses testified to consumer demand and displacement of the prior_art product q
well in light of that [ total shade sales staying flat ] can you explain why *787 the sales of mr._fergusons shade show an upward trend.. from 1975 about 30,000 to 4 & 1/2 million in 1983 ?
... a
well it has to be taking business from the cut in store shade because if the total units are fairly constant and the ferguson_shade is increasing in numbers the only place it could come from would be at the expense of the cut in store type product

the district_court gave no weight to the evidence of commercial_impact ; nor did the panel_majority
precedent requires that all the evidence including the objective_indicia must be considered in determination of unobviousness
see e.g. simmons fastener corp. v. illinois tool works inc. 739_f.2d_1573 1575 222_uspq_744 746 fed.cir.1984 cert
denied 471_u.s._1065 105_s.ct._2138 85_l.ed.2d_496_(1985)` evidence arising out of the so-calledsecondary_considerations must always when present be considered en route to a determination of obviousness'

2
copying
ferguson testified about the interest shown in his invention by buyers and competitors at the january 1976 housewares show in chicago a
well that was the first national introduction of the product and it was a big booth
thats the largest show in our industry so thats where all the buyers come to see the new products and we had a demonstration and a large display really introducing the product to everybody
the aisles were packed with people
it was the best ive ever seen for the demonstrations
during that time the clopay people spent quite a bit of time in our booth actually even measuring the physical displays trying to understand as much as they could about our product

uncontradicted evidence showing copying by six manufacturers kenney breneman graber clopay joanna-western and stanley appears throughout the record
the jury could have placed weight in its determination of unobviousness on this imitation by the entire window_shade industry

3
failure by others
the district_court stated in its opinion there was no evidence that others skilled in the art tried and failed to find a solution to the problems preventing in-home fitting of window_shades once the corcoran_material was introduced
newell 606 f.supp.at 1294 226 uspq at 165
the record does not match this statement
there was testimony that the industry had long recognized the existence of significant problems with the way window_shades were fitted yet previous solutions failed for various reasons
fallin testified about a device designed to enable cutting a shade at home
ferguson testified about an adjustable end-plug

the jury heard this testimony that the industry was aware of the problems with the cut-in-store type of shade
they heard of attempted remedies that failed and the development of other take-home shade systems that failed
there was substantial_evidence of failure by others who were presumably of skill in the window_shade_art

the jury verdict
the objective_indicia can comprise compelling evidence of nonobviousness
stratoflex inc. v. aeroquip_corp. 713_f.2d_1530 1538 218_uspq_871 879 fed.cir.1983` evidence of secondary_considerations may often be the most probative and cogent evidence in the record
it may often establish that an invention appearing to have been obvious in light of the prior_art was not'
this considerable_evidence was before the jury along with the prior_art the prosecution history and extensive argument and explanation and demonstration by counsel and witnesses for both sides

`` determining the weight and credibility of the evidence is the special province of the trier of fact'
inwood laboratories inc. v. ives laboratories inc. 456_u.s._844 856 102_s.ct._2182 2189 72_l.ed.2d_606_(1982)
the trier of fact must not only identify the prior_art its scope and content but it must also weigh all the evidence *788 impose the viewpoint of the person of ordinary_skill and determine if the burden of proof has been met

a reasonable_jury on the evidence presented could have concluded that the claimed invention had not been proved obvious by clear and convincing_evidence
i would reinstate the jury_verdict for on the correct_standard of review the grounds for reversal of the jury_verdict are not met

there may be issues formed by the evidence as to some of the facts and not as to others

newell argues that a 1967 internal memorandum of a kenney_employee proposing this combination was inadmissible evidence because it was not technically` prior_art'

at first blush the interpretation limiting` securement means' to` adhesive' appears erroneous
however it must be understood as newell admits that staples tacks and the like do not meet the limitations of the securement means e.g.` constant securing force' or the overall limitation that newell admits the shade must be capable of assembly by customers without tools
even intermittent glue is not within the claim per the inventor
