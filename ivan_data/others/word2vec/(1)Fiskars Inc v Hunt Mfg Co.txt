opinion
pauline newman circuit_judge
hunt manufacturing co. hunt appeals the judgment of the united_states_district_court for the western_district of wisconsin,1 entered upon a jury_verdict of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents of united_states patent no._5322,001 the001 or fiskars_patent entitled` paper cutter with circular blades' owned by fiskars_oy_ab and fiskars inc. together` fiskars'
hunt also appeals the district_courts determination that there was not inequitable_conduct in the united_states patent and trademark_office
hunt and its counsel joseph_f._posillico appeal the ruling that mr. posillico had vexatiously and unreasonably multiplied the proceedings on the issue of inequitable_conduct thereby incurring liability for fiskars litigation costs on that issue

the judgment is affirmed

background
the001_patent is directed to a circular-blade paper_cutter illustrated in patent figure 1

*1320. ?
fig._1
in contrast with guillotine-type paper_cutters which employ a long blade that pivots at one end the patented cutter has a circular_blade 18 enclosed in a carriage_assembly 16 that rides along a rail 14
the rail is secured to the cutting_board at both ends by pivots 27 which allow the rail to be raised for insertion of the paper
the blade_assembly is biased upwardly by springs 48 as seen in the detailed drawings of the carriage_assembly in patent figures 5_and_6

fig._5
?
fig._6
to cut the paper the carriage_assembly enclosing the blade is pressed down and drawn along the rail
when the pressure is released the biasing springs return the carriage_assembly and blade to an inoperative_position preventing accidental cuts of paper or operator

claims 1_and_8 are representative with paragraphing and emphases added to show the terms at issue with respect to infringement under the doctrine of equivalents 1
a cutting_board assembly for cutting or trimming paper_sheets said assembly comprising
[ a ] a cutting_board [ b ] a pair of posts mounted on said cutting_board [ c ] a rail_assembly pivotally mounted on said posts in a parallel relation to said cutting_board *1321 [ d ] a carriage_assembly mounted on said rail_assembly for movement across the cutting_board [ e ] a circular_cutting_blade mounted for rotary motion in said carriage_assembly [ f ] means for biasing said carriage_assembly to an inoperative_position on said rail_assembly said biasing means comprises a pair of leaf_springs mounted on said carriage_assembly for biasing said carriage_assembly to an inoperative_position on said rail_assembly
[ g ] whereby said carriage_assembly must be moved from said inoperative_position to an operative position on the rail_assembly for cutting or trimming the paper_sheets
8
apparatus for cutting sheet material comprising [ a ] a cutter_board [ b ] a pair of pivot_blocks mounted in a spaced relation on said cutter_board [ c ] a rail_assembly pivotally mounted on said pivot_blocks for movement between operative and inoperative_positions with respect to said board [ d ] a carriage_assembly mounted on said rail_assembly for translational movement across the board [ e ] said carriage_assembly including a rotary cutting blade and
[ f ] a spring_assembly formed on said carriage_assembly for biasing said carriage_assembly to an inoperative_position on said rail_assembly
[ g ] whereby said cutting blade is activated by pressing said carriage_assembly down and sliding said carriage_assembly across said rail_assembly
the accused hunt paper_cutter called the heavy duty rotary 12 paper trimmer differs in two ways from the fiskars_device that is described and claimed in the001_patent
first with respect to clause [ e ] of claims 1_and_8 in the fiskars_device the blade is mounted in the carriage_assembly and the entire carriage_assembly is biased by a spring whereas the hunt circular_blade is mounted in a sub-assembly that is biased by a spring within the carriage_assembly
second clause [ f ] of claim 1 specifies a pair of leaf_springs and clause [ f ] of claim 8 does not specify the kind of spring but states that the spring_assembly is` formed on' the carriage_assembly ; the hunt_device uses a free-standing coil_spring

upon fiskars suit for patent infringement hunt raised the defenses of non-infringement patent_invalidity and unenforceability for inequitable_conduct
the district_court granted partial summary judgment that hunt did not literally infringe the001_patent ; that ruling is not appealed
hunt abandoned the defense of patent_invalidity at the start of trial
the issue of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents was tried to a jury
the issue of inequitable_conduct was tried to the court

i
infringement
a
prosecution history estoppel
the district_court determined before trial that prosecution_history estoppel did not preclude fiskars from asserting infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
hunt states that the court erred in its rulings concerning estoppel

1
the carriage assembly
hunt argues that fiskars is estopped from asserting equivalency between the biased carriage_assembly of the claims and the biased_sub-assembly of the hunt_device because during prosecution fiskars amended the term` cutting blade' to` carriage_assembly'
fiskars argues that any presumption that the amendment was made for reasons of patentability was rebutted by evidence that this amendment was not made to overcome any cited reference the inventor explained that this amendment was made to remove the unintended limitation of the claims to a cutting blade for other blades such as perforating *1322 and scoring blades could also be used without change in the device

hunt also relies on united_states patents no._5069,097 to mori and no._3301,117 to spaulding both of which are directed to paper_cutters
the examiner had cited mori for its showing of a cutting assembly using a circular_blade but lacking a means of biasing the cutting blade to an inoperative_position and spaulding for its showing of a cutting assembly with means for biasing non-circular_blades to an inoperative_position on a rail
the district_court discussed these patents and their role in the patentability of the fiskars_patent in extensive detail
the court observed that mori shows a circular_cutting_blade that is biased downward toward the paper to be cut but does not show biasing the blade and carriage upward to an inoperative_position as in the fiskars_patent ; the court found that the mori cutting blade is biased in the opposite direction for a different purpose
concerning spaulding the district_court observed that spaulding shows two non-circular_blades protruding from the bottom of a carriage that rides on a rail that is upwardly biased by springs
in spaulding downward pressure moves the rail and carriage_assembly into contact with the paper but when the cutter is not in use the blades protrude below the rail
by contrast in the fiskars_device the carriage and blade but not the rail move to bring the blade into contact with the paper such that when the cutter is not in use the blade does not protrude below the rail because both the carriage and the blade are biased upwardly

the district_court found that the amendment substituting` carriage_assembly' for` cutting blade' was not directed to distinguishing the claims from the cited references and thus that the amendment was not made for reasons of patentability
see warner-jenkinson co. v. hilton davis chem co. 520_u.s._17 33 117_s.ct._1040 137_l.ed.2d_146 41_uspq2d_1865 1873 1997 the presumption that an amendment was made for reasons of patentability is` subject to rebuttal if an appropriate reason for a required amendment is established'
we discern no reversible error in the district_courts conclusion
thus the question of equivalency between these elements the claimed biased_assembly and the hunt biased_sub-assembly was properly presented for jury determination

2
the biasing spring
the fiskars_patent variously claims the biasing spring as` a pair of leaf_springs' claim 1` a pair of spring blades' claim 6 and` a spring_assembly formed on the carriage_assembly' claim 8
the district_court held that the prosecution_history did not establish an estoppel against equivalency between the claimed biasing pair of leaf_springs and the hunt biasing coil_spring and presented the question of equivalency to the jury

hunt argues that all of the claims should be interpreted as limited to springs that are located` in the rail' and that any broader interpretation is estopped by the prosecution_history
only claim 10 states that the spring is located in the rail ; claim 10 was not asserted against hunt
although no asserted claim requires that the spring is located in the rail hunt argues that this feature was emphasized during prosecution in order to distinguish the spaulding and mori references and that the applicant deceived the examiner into thinking that all of the claims had been amended to include the limitation that appears in claim 10
the district_court did not accept hunts position
we agree that estoppel did not arise from this assertion of deception of the examiner for the prosecution record clearly stated which claims were amended to add the limitation that the spring is in the rail and the examiner thereafter allowed the claims
`` [ t ] here is a presumption that public officers perform their duties correctly fairly in good faith and in accordance with the law and governing regulations..' haley v. department of the treasury 977_f.2d_553 558 fed.cir.1992 quoting united_states v. chemical foundation inc. 272_u.s._1 14-15 47_s.ct._1 71_l.ed._131_(1926)

*1323 the claims in suit were not amended to add the limitation of the spring in the rail
the district_court correctly ruled that the claims in suit are not limited to a device wherein the spring is located in the rail and that there is no estoppel against equivalency based on the location of the spring

hunt also argues that any infringing spring must perform the dual roles of biasing and supporting the blade_assembly
hunt cites fiskars argument during prosecution that the spring not only biases the blade but also supports the carriage on the rail and states that the hunt coil_spring does not provide support for the carriage sub-assembly
fiskars expert testified that a spring that biases something in an upward direction necessarily supports it

fiskars points out that the only asserted claim that was amended to include a supporting as well as a biasing function was claim 6 and that claim 6 is the only asserted claim in which the support function was mentioned in prosecution argument
although claim 6 may be subject to prosecution_history estoppel as to this element the other claims in suit are not
claims whose allowance was not due to a particular argument are not subject to estoppel deriving from that argument
we agree with the district_court that there was no estoppel barring the jury question of equivalency of the biasing springs

b
the prior art
hunt argues that the burden of proof was misplaced as to whether a hypothetical_claim covering the range of equivalents fiskars was asserting would ensnare the prior_art
hunt does not argue that a hypothetical_claim embracing its device would not be patentable ; hunt simply argues that fiskars had the burden of presenting evidence and establishing that hunts device was not in the prior_art as part of its proof of infringement
hunt states that the district_court misplaced the burden of proof thus requiring a new_trial

hunts theory is incorrect
it is an affirmative_defense of the accused infringer to allege and to show that it is practicing the prior_art
when the patentee has presented a prima_facie_case of infringement the burden shifts to the accused infringer to come forward with evidence to establish this defense
see national presto indus. inc. v. west bend co. 76_f.3d_1185 1192 37_uspq2d_1685 1689 fed.cir.1996` when the patentee has made a prima_facie_case of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents the burden of coming forward with evidence to show that the accused device is in the prior_art is upon the accused infringer'
the patentee is not required to negate an affirmative_defense that has not been pled and supported with evidence

hunt did not allege that its device is in the prior_art or that a hypothetical_claim covering its device would be unpatentable
see wilson sporting goods co. v. david geoffrey & associates 904_f.2d_677 685 14_uspq2d_1942 1949 fed.cir.1990 determining patentability of a hypothetical_claim covering the accused device
absent any evidence proffered by hunt to show that its device was in the prior_art there was nothing for fiskars to rebut

c. the jury verdicts
the question of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents was tried to a jury
for each claimed element for which equivalency was asserted witnesses addressed the similarities and differences as to the substituted element including the function way and result of each element
after three days of trial the jury found infringement of claims 1 5 6 and 8 and non-infringement of claims 2_and_9
on post-trial motions the district_court upheld the verdicts ruling that the jurys findings were supported by substantial_evidence and that a new_trial was not warranted

the jurys verdicts must be sustained if they are supported by substantial_evidence upon the entirety of the record
see national presto 76 f.3d at 1190 37 uspq2d at 1687 reviewing the trial proceedings` to ascertain whether there was substantial_evidence whereby a reasonable *1324 jury could have reached the verdict that was reached'
hunt argues that no reasonable_jury could have found infringement by equivalency pointing particularly to the differences between coil and leaf_springs and arguing that these springs are not interchangeable as they are embodied in the accused and patented devices

interchangeability is indeed relevant to equivalency and the subject of the springs and their function the way the function was performed and the result were the subject of testimony and conflicting views at trial
we agree with the district_court that a reasonable_jury could have accepted the evidence presented by fiskars that the hunt_devices coil_spring performed substantially the same biasing and supporting function in substantially the same way with substantially the same result compared with the leaf_springs of the fiskars_device
the evidence of equivalency between the biased_assembly and the biased_sub-assembly was also substantial and sufficient to support the verdict

hunt complains that the district_court did not permit hunt to present evidence to the jury of the separate_patentability of its device
since it is well established that separate_patentability does not avoid equivalency as a matter of law see atlas powder co. v. e.i
du pont de nemours & co. 750_f.2d_1569 1580 224_uspq_409 417 fed.cir.1984` where defendant has appropriated the material features of the patent in suit infringement will be foundeven when those features have been supplemented and modified to such an extent that the defendant may be entitled to a patent for the improvement
`` we do not intrude upon the trial_courts evidentiary_ruling see kearns v. chrysler corp. 32_f.3d_1541 1547 31_uspq2d_1746 1750 fed.cir.1994`the decision to admit or exclude evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial_court and will be reversed on appeal only for a clear_abuse of that discretion
`` quoting smith & lee assocs. inc. v. city of taylor mich. 13_f.3d_920 928 6th cir.1993 ; cooper v. carl a. nelson & co. 211_f.3d_1008 1018 7th cir.2000` when reviewing the district_courts evidentiary decisions we employ an abuse of discretion standard and consequently give great deference to the trial_court'
the admission or exclusion of evidence not material to the issue of infringement is consigned to the discretion of the trial_judge

hunt also states that if any individual element of the hunt_device is in the prior_art that element can not be deemed equivalent to any claimed element
that theory is incorrect
a claim to a mechanical device usually recites a combination of several elements most or all of which may be separately known
see rosemount inc. v. beckman instruments inc. 727_f.2d_1540 1546 221_uspq_1 7 fed.cir.1984` a combination may be patentable whether it be composed of elements all new partly new or all old' ; fromson v. advance offset plate inc. 755_f.2d_1549 1556_n._3 225_uspq_26 31_n._3_(fed.cir.1985)` only god works from nothing
men must work with old elements`
that an element of an accused device already existed does not bar equivalency as to that element
see warner-jenkinson 520 u.s. at 25 117_s.ct._1040 41 uspq2d at 1869 known interchangeability of elements is evidence of equivalency citing graver tank & mfg co. v. linde air prods co. 339_u.s._605 70_s.ct._854 94_l.ed._1097 85_uspq_328_(1950)

the verdicts of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents were supported by substantial_evidence and were in accordance with law and the judgment entered thereon must be affirmed

d. damages
the jury awarded damages to fiskars in the amounts of $ 114,760 for lost profits $ 1,127,650 for past price_erosion and $ 1,856,552 for future price_erosion
hunt appeals the award as` speculative and contradictory'

on the issue of lost profits hunt does not appeal the calculation thereof
instead *1325 hunt argued at trial and again on appeal that fiskars would not have made the sales that hunt made and therefore is not entitled to damages based on those sales
hunt stressed that ninety percent of its sales were made to the staples chain of office supply stores and argued that staples prefers to deal with a single_supplier who would provide a full_line of paper_cutters linear as well as rotary and that since fiskars did not make a full_line of paper_cutters fiskars would not have made any sales of rotary paper_cutters to staples

the evidence at trial was that no single_supplier would have been able to provide a full_line of paper_cutters without infringing the fiskars_patent for no non-infringing substitute was commercially available for fiskars rotary cutter
the district_court reviewing the evidence on post-trial motions concluded that a reasonable_jury could have found that hunts customer staples would have purchased its supply of rotary_cutters from fiskars but for hunts infringement
we agree that there was substantial_evidence supporting the verdict on this issue

hunt also challenges the damages_verdicts based on price_erosion
evidence on this issue was presented by financial and marketing officers and accounting witnesses for both sides
fiskars damages_expert testified as to the effect of hunts past infringement on fiskars prices and the effect of this price_erosion projected into the future
the witness applied the factors set forth in panduit corp. v. stahlin bros. fibre works inc. 575_f.2d_1152 197_uspq_726_(6th_cir.1978) and adopted by the federal_circuit see e.g. rite-hite corp. v. kelley co. 56_f.3d_1538 1545 35_uspq2d_1065 1069 fed.cir.1995 en banc

hunt argues that fiskars damages_expert failed to take into account that fiskars would have experienced fewer sales had it not reduced its prices in the face of hunts competing infringing device
hunt also disputes the testimony that fiskars sales of rotary_cutters would have grown at the rate of 10 % in an industry that was growing overall at 1 %
a witness from fiskars marketing department testified that fiskars had experienced this growth rate in the sales of its rotary_cutters and estimated the future growth rate and testified concerning the price reductions fiskars had been obliged to make in response to hunts infringing sales
another fiskars witness testified concerning the difficulty fiskars would encounter in attempting to reestablish its former prices after having reduced its prices in response to hunts infringing sales and explained that hunts undercutting prices would lead to continuing price_erosion even after infringement had ceased
hunts witnesses disputed the conclusions of fiskars witnesses and presented contrary opinions

on these conflicting positions and arguments there was substantial_evidence whereby a reasonable_jury could have reached the damages_verdicts here reached
see brooktree corp. v. advanced micro devices inc. 977_f.2d_1555 1579-80 24_uspq2d_1401 1418-19 fed.cir.1992 the jury award of damages is upheld unless it is`grossly excessive or monstrous clearly not supported by the evidence or based only on speculation or guesswork' quoting los angeles memorial coliseum comm n v. national football league 791_f.2d_1356 1360 9th cir.1986 ; smith v. rowe 761_f.2d_360 368 7th cir.1985` damages assessed by a jury are largely discretionary with it.. to reverse the judgment of the trial_court the appellate_court must conclude that the verdict was sogross ormonstrously excessive that the trial_court abused its discretion in permitting it to stand'
( quoting galard v. johnson 504_f.2d_1198 1200 7th cir.1974

hunt also argues that the district_court erred in refusing to strike fiskars entire damages case because fiskars did not disclose early enough in the discovery process that it had made some sales to national chains such as staples
the district_court commented in its post-trial *1326 memorandum that it had offered to exclude this evidence from the damages trial but that hunt had declined the offer since the evidence was useful to hunt by diminishing the significance of hunts infringing sales
the district_court held that hunt can not on post trial motion attack an evidentiary_ruling that it requested having been offered and rejected the ruling it now demands
the district_courts actions were within its discretion and are sustained

e. other challenged rulings
hunt argues that the district_court erred in limiting hunts presentation at trial to the references that hunt filed in accordance with 35 u.s.c.¡± 282 and the courts pre-trial rules and orders
the district_court denying hunts motion for a new_trial on this ground referred to hunts multiple flouting of the courts` deadlines for the completion of discovery for the filing of expert_reports for the filing of dispositive motions and for disclosure of lay witnesses'
the district_courts orders concerning scheduling and expert_reports were reasonable trial_management and will not be disturbed
see abbott_labs
v. brennan 952_f.2d_1346 1351 21_uspq2d_1192 1196 fed.cir.1991` it is improper on appeal to disturb a district_courts trial_management absent a clear_abuse of judicial_discretion
`` ; hebert v. lisle_corp. 99_f.3d_1109 1114 40_uspq2d_1611 1614 fed.cir.1996 same
we take note that despite these infractions the court granted hunt a three-week continuance when on the thursday before trial hunt announced a newly discovered reference
this reference was then translated and admitted into evidence

hunt complains of other rulings and argues that the district_court` tramples on hunts due process rights'
this argument is belied by the record
we discern no abuse of discretion in the district_courts evidentiary_rulings

ii
inequitable conduct
hunt raised the defense that the001_patent is unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct by fiskars during prosecution in the patent and trademark_office

a ruling of inequitable_conduct in patent_prosecution requires the threshold findings that the applicant withheld material information from the pto during examination of the patent or submitted material false information and that the applicant acted with the intent to deceive or mislead the examiner into granting the patent
these findings must be made by clear and convincing_evidence
see kingsdown medical consultants ltd. v. hollister inc. 863_f.2d_867 876 9_uspq2d_1384 1392 fed.cir.1988 en banc
when both materiality and intent have been established these facts are weighed to determine the ultimate_question of inequitable_conduct

this issue was tried to the court as to the findings of underlying facts of materiality and intent as well as the ultimate_question of whether these facts constituted inequitable_conduct
this procedure is within the district_courts discretion as explained in hebert v. lisle_corp. 99_f.3d_1109 1114 40_uspq2d_1611 1614 fed.cir.1996 and on appellate review the district_courts factual findings are reviewed for clear error while the ruling on the ultimate_question is reviewed on the standard of abuse of discretion
see modine mfg co. v. allen group inc. 917_f.2d_538 541 16_uspq2d_1622 1624 fed.cir.1990 ; kingsdown 863 f.2d at 876 9 uspq2d at 1392

a
hunt states that four material items were withheld from the pto with the intent to deceive or mislead the examiner
the four items were three prior_art paper_cutters and a patent to benavidez
*1327 hunt concentrated its argument on a paper_cutter called the` maruzen_device' which the inventor had seen at a trade show
the inventor testified that he considered this device to be the closest prior_art

the prosecution_history shows a brochure describing the maruzen paper_cutter listed on pto form 1449` list of references cited by applicant s' and submitted to the pto
although hunt does not dispute that the maruzen brochure was submitted to the pto hunt argues that the examiner did not consider it pointing to the line drawn through this listing on form 1449
see man
pat
exam
p. 609 7th ed.1998 directing an examiner to line through a reference that is not being considered 2
hunt states that this placed on fiskars the obligation to stress to the examiner the relevance of the maruzen_device
however the earlier pto requirement that the applicant explain the relevance of the references listed was removed in 1992
hunt makes no argument that fiskars otherwise wrongly withheld the brochure

the district_court held that when a reference was cited to the patent examiner it can not be deemed to have been withheld citing scripps clinic & research found
v. genentech inc. 927_f.2d_1565 18_uspq2d_1001_(fed.cir.1991)
in scripps the court held that inequitable_conduct could not be based on an applicants failure to cite a prior_art_reference when the examiner independently cited the same reference
hunt argues that the district_court misread scripps ; we do not share hunts view
an applicant can not be guilty of inequitable_conduct if the reference was cited to the examiner whether or not it was a ground of rejection by the examiner
we do not know the examiners reason for lining out the three cutters but fiskars citation as prior_art defeats hunts charge that the maruzen_device was withheld with deceptive_intent
an applicant is not required to tell the pto twice about the same prior_art on pain of loss of the patent for inequitable_conduct

the district_court held that hunt failed to introduce any evidence of withholding of prior_art material to patentability
in its brief hunt discusses the features of the three cutters that are now asserted to be material to patentability
however as the court observed there was no evidence at trial as to how these three references compared in relevance to the thirteen references considered and listed by the examiner
the district_courts ruling that hunt produced no evidence of withholding of material_prior_art is well supported by the record

on the issue of intent hunt provided no evidence of intentional withholding of material_prior_art
hunt cites paragon podiatry lab. inc. v. klm labs. inc. 984_f.2d_1182 25_uspq2d_1561_(fed.cir.1993) for its observation that a` smoking gun' is` not always necessary' to establish intent to deceive
however paragon does not hold that there need be no evidence of culpable_intent
in paragon the affiants with` deliberate artfulness' swore that they were` not employed' by paragon whereas they were owners or paid consultants of paragon ; this evidence was found to establish culpable_intent
the court did not hold in paragon that intent could be found without any factual basis
see e.g. goodyear tire & rubber_co. v. hercules tire & rubber_co. 162_f.3d_1113 1122 fed.cir.1998` both materiality and culpable_intent are essential factual predicates of inequitable_conduct and each must be proved by clear and convincing_evidence
`` ; b.f. goodrich co. v. aircraft braking systems corp. 72_f.3d_1577 1584 37_uspq2d_1314 1319 fed.cir.1996` one alleging inequitable_conduct *1328 must prove the threshold elements of materiality and intent by clear and convincing_evidence'

we affirm the district_courts ruling that the facts predicate to inequitable_conduct were not established

b
the district_court deemed the inequitable_conduct claim` so lacking in substance as to constitute a waste of the time and resources of all the participants'
the court imposed sanctions on hunts counsel for` multiply [ ing ] the proceedings.. unreasonably and vexatiously' 28 u.s.c.¡± 19273 and awarded fiskars $ 8,582.50 of the attorney fees it incurred in defending against this charge

hunts counsel argues that the district_court abused its discretion in imposing this sanction
he states that he presented a prima_facie_case of inequitable_conduct and that he did not act in bad_faith
he argues that the inventor might have supported the charge of inequitable_conduct had he been less credible or his testimony different and that credibility could not be known until the inventor testified at the trial
even a generous view of the record from hunts position does not weaken the district_courts observation that neither material withholding nor intent to deceive was supported with evidence sufficient to make a prima_facie_case
an applicants citation of prior_art in accordance with the rules of the pto precludes a finding of withholding of that prior_art with deceptive_intent

the seventh circuit makes clear that liability under ¡± 1927 for unreasonable and vexatious prolongation of the proceedings does not require that the actions were taken in bad_faith
see knorr brake corp. v. harbil inc. 738_f.2d_223 226-27 7th cir.1984` this court has not required an express finding by the district_court of subjective bad_faith or intent to delay to support an award of fees under section 1927'
in the words of the district_court` [ hunts ] decision to pursue the counterclaim caused [ fiskars ] to incur additional expenses created extensive work for the court and cast a cloud over the integrity of the inventor and his original counsel
`` 4
