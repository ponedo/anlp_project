opinion
rader circuit_judge
in this patent infringement case gambro_lundia_ab gambro appeals and baxter healthcare corporation baxter cross-appeals a final judgment of the united_states_district_court for the district of colorado
the patent at issue u.s. patent no._4585,552552_patent claims a` system for the measurement of the difference between two fluid flows in separate ducts'
this invention recalibrates sensors during hemodialysis to accurately measure the impurities removed from a patients blood
due to error in the district_courts analyses of invalidity unenforceability and infringement this court reverses

background
hemodialysis commonly called dialysis removes contaminants and excess fluid from the patients blood when the kidneys do not function properly
hemodialysis works by passing a dialysate solution through a machine called a dialyzer which functions as an *1575 artificial kidney
in the dialyzer the dialysate passes on one side of a porous diffusion membrane while the patients blood passes on the other side
because of the pressure differential across the membrane blood contaminants and excess fluid diffuse through the membrane from the patients blood into the dialysate
these impurities diffused from the patients blood are known as ultrafiltrate

after hemodialysis the volume of the dialysate is greater
the difference between the initial and end volumes of dialysate can be used to calculate the amount of the ultrafiltrate removed from a patients blood
this calculation is critical to the success of hemodialysis
removal of too much or too little ultrafiltrate may lead to severe medical problems or even death

repgreen limited repgreen a british bioengineering company improved ultrafiltrate calculation
keith wittingham repgreens chief designer introduced the repgreen_monitoring system the ufm 1000 in late 1977
wittinghams development relied on the research of professor michael sanderson
the ufm 1000 used two electromagnetic flow sensors to measure the difference between the rate of dialysate flow into and out of the dialyzer
the difference in flow rates indicated the quantity of ultrafiltrate leaving the system
to calibrate the system for an accurate measurement of dialysate flow rates the operator would direct clean_dialysate through both sensors before dialysis
this calibration method however could not account for clogging in the outflow_sensor during dialysis
over time the ultrafiltrate would build up behind the outflow_sensor and disrupt the accuracy of the measurements
experts refer to this increasing inaccuracy as` drift'

in the late 1970s gambro sought to improve ultrafiltrate monitoring
during 1979 wittingham met with gambro_engineers on two occasions to discuss repgreens development of an ultrafiltrate monitor for gambro
in july 1979 after repgreen went bankrupt gambro purchased repgreens hemodialysis technology including the rights to the ufm 1000 monitor
after acquiring repgreens technology gambros research team worked for three years on improving ultrafiltration monitors
in june 1982 four gambro_engineers including bengt-ake gummesson refined the monitoring system
their invention ultimately issued as the552_patent

gambro filed its initial patent application in sweden on september 28 1982
gambro followed up with a u.s._application in september 1983
gunnar boberg repgreens in-house_patent_counsel and arnold krumholz repgreens u.s. patent counsel prosecuted the u.s._application
the examiner rejected claim 1 as anticipated by a german_patent application german756
in response gambro provided the examiner with a german-language copy of german756 along with arguments prepared by boberg who is fluent in german
based on this submission the examiner withdrew the rejection
the552_patent issued on april_29,_1986

the gambro_invention uses valves to direct clean_dialysate around the dialyzer to recalibrate the sensors during dialysis
the inventions valve_system can direct clean_dialysate through the first flow sensor around the dialyzer and through the second_flow_sensor
to recalibrate the invention momentarily blocks passage of contaminated dialysate through the outflow_sensor
instead clean_dialysate flows through the outflow_sensor and recalibrates the detectors with the same clean_dialysate flowing through both intake and outflow_sensors
after the brief recalibration the hemodialysis continues with contaminated dialysate flowing through the second sensor
claim 1 of the552_patent reads [ 1 ] in dialysis equipment including a dialyser a system for measuring the difference in the rate of flow between first and second_fluid_streams said first_fluid_stream comprising clean_dialysis_solution flowing to the dialyser and said second_fluid_stream comprising spent dialysis_solution flowing from the dialyser said system comprising
[ 2 ] a first duct for receiving said first_fluid_stream flowing therethrough [ 3 ] a second_duct for receiving said second_fluid_stream flowing therethrough [ 4 ] measuring means for measuring the difference in the rate of flow between said *1576 first and second_fluid_streams within said first and second_ducts [ 5 ] and transferring_means for preventing the flow of said second_fluid_stream through said second_duct while flowing said first_fluid_stream through both said first and second_ducts without passing said first_fluid_stream through the dialyser and without altering said rate of flow of said first_fluid_stream between said first and second_ducts such that said rate of flow of said first_fluid_stream through said first and second_ducts is substantially equal [ 6 ] whereby the measured difference of the rate of flow of said first_fluid_stream flowing through said first and second_ducts is adaptable as a reference
( paragraph enumeration added

in 1984 baxter acquired the dialysis equipment division of extracorporeal inc
dissatisfied with the accuracy of the extracorporeal technology baxter developed the baxter_sps 550 and began marketing the device in december 1987
gambro filed suit against baxter in the district court for the district of colorado in march 1992 claiming the baxter_sps 550 infringed the552_patent
in defense baxter asserted the invalidity and unenforceability of the552_patent

after a ten-day bench trial on the issues of infringement validity and unenforceability the district_court held claim 1 of the gambro552_patent invalid for obviousness and derivation and unenforceable for inequitable_conduct
the district_court also entered judgment in favor of baxter on infringement contributory infringement inducing infringement and willful infringement due to the invalidity and unenforceability of the552_patent
further the district_court declined to award either party attorney fees or costs

discussion
i. derivation
the trial_judge found that gambro had derived the552 invention from a wittingham_proposal left in the files when gambro acquired repgreens dialysis technology
this court reviews a finding of derivation as a question of fact
price v. symsek 988_f.2d_1187 1190 26_uspq2d_1031 1033 fed.cir.1993
this requires acceptance of the district_courts findings unless clearly erroneous or predicated on an improper legal foundation
raytheon co. v. roper corp. 724_f.2d_951 956 220_uspq_592 596 fed.cir.1983
to show derivation the party asserting invalidity must prove both prior_conception of the invention by another and communication of that conception to the patentee
price 988 f.2d at 1190
this court reviews a determination of prior_conception which must be proven by facts supported by clear and convincing_evidence as a question of law based on underlying factual_findings
id.at 1190-92

turning first to conception the district_court found that wittingham had conceived the invention no later than july 1979
the court based this finding on wittinghams testimony and the wittingham_proposal left in the repgreen file
although the district_court found wittingham highly credible an inventors testimony standing alone is insufficient to prove conception
see price 988 f.2d at 1194
conception requires corroboration of the inventors testimony
id

thus this court must weigh whether the wittingham_proposal prepared in 1979 corroborates wittinghams testimony of conception
the proposal is a four-page document alluding to an ultrafiltration monitor with valves that automatically zero the sensors upon start-up
the proposal briefly discusses the auto zero/start feature to ensure ease of operation the process of shunting the kidney in order to zero monitor will be done automatically on pressing of the start button
this will also initiate the automatic zeroing of unit
baxter contends that this document also discloses the concept of recalibration or zeroing during dialysis
in support of this contention baxter identifies the following passage from the proposal a zero button may also be necessary in order to zero ultrafiltration monitor but not start the automatic_control start signal can not be allowed till 20 minutes after switch on ?
baxter argues that the only reason to zero the monitor without starting the automatic_control is to zero the monitor when it is *1577 already started-in other words during dialysis

baxters novel interpretation of this single ambiguous passage in the wittingham_proposal however lacks sufficient support to corroborate wittinghams conception testimony
first the reference is so unclear that even wittingham conceded that this single sentence does not state expressly the concept of recalibration during dialysis
in fact the parenthetical within the sentence suggests that the device should not be in use` till 20 minutes after switch on'
for this reason among others professor_sanderson an expert in dialysis whose early research formed the basis of wittinghams work testified that one of ordinary_skill in dialysis in 1982 would not have understood this obscure passage to disclose recalibration during dialysis
professor_sanderson noted that the repgreen_monitor needed twenty minutes to stabilize before use
therefore this obscure_sentence more reasonably suggests the use of the zero button during the pre-dialysis warm-up period

in addition the obscure_sentence states that depressing the button calibrates the monitor but does` not start the automatic_control'
in its ordinary start-up operation the repgreen_monitor would calibrate the monitor start the automatic_control and finally automatically begin the dialysis
the reference to` zeroing' before the automatic_control phase thus suggests calibration before dialysis not during dialysis
further if wittingham had conceived of recalibration during dialysis-an important advance in the dialysis_art-the four-page wittingham_proposal would surely contain more than a single cryptic sentence memorializing the advance
accordingly this court determines that the wittingham_proposal does not corroborate conception

the only other evidence offered by baxter to corroborate conception is the testimony of mr. smith wittinghams supervisor at repgreen
referring to the ambiguous sentence smith testified that the wittingham_proposal included the idea of calibration during dialysis
the trial_judge however did not rely on this self-serving testimony in finding prior_conception
moreover as noted above the language of the wittingham_proposal itself belies smiths testimony about calibration during dialysis
in sum this court concludes that baxter failed to meet its burden of proving by facts supported by clear and convincing_evidence that wittingham conceived the invention of the552_patent

the second prong of the derivation test-communication of the prior_conception to the named inventor-poses similar difficulties for baxter
as an initial matter the district_court applied the wrong legal standard
citing new_england_braiding co. v. a.w
chesterton_co. 970_f.2d_878 23_uspq2d_1622_(fed.cir.1992) the district_court concluded that baxter did not need to prove communication of the entire conception but rather only so much of the invention` as would have made it obvious to one of ordinary_skill in the art'
gambro_lundia_ab v. baxter_healthcare_corp. 896_f.supp._1522 1540 d.colo.1995 citing new_england_braiding 970 f.2d at 883
based on this reasoning the district_court applied the obviousness standard in 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 1994 to determine that the named inventors received enough information to make the invention obvious to one skilled in the dialysis_art
this reasoning however misconstrues the dictum in new_england_braiding and introduces incorrectly an obviousness analysis into the test for derivation

the supreme court announced the standard for finding communication of a prior_conception over 125 years ago in agawam woolen v. jordan 74 u.s. 7 wall
583 19_l.ed._177_(1868)
the court required a showing that the communication` enabled an ordinary mechanic without the exercise of any ingenuity and special skill on his part to construct and put the improvement in successful operation'
id.74 u.s at 602-03 emphasis added
this courts predecessor consistently applied this supreme court standard
see e.g. hedgewick v. akers 497_f.2d_905 908 182_uspq_167 169 ccpa 1974` communication of a complete conception must be sufficient to enable one of ordinary_skill in the art to construct and successfully operate the invention'
( emphasis added ; degroff v. roth 56_c.c.p.a._1331 412_f.2d_1401 1405 162_uspq_361 365 ccpa 1969

*1578 this court recognizes that the district_courts incorrect derivation standard springs from dictum in this courts new_england_braiding decision
in that case this court noted` to invalidate a patent for derivation of invention a party must demonstrate that the named inventor in the patent acquired knowledge of the claimed invention from another or at least so much of the claimed invention as would have made it obvious to one of ordinary_skill in the art'
new_england_braiding 970 f.2d at 883
this dictum did not in fact incorporate a determination of obviousness into a section 102 f analysis
indeed this court in new_england_braiding did not apply such a test

the new_england_braiding court upheld the denial of a preliminary injunction because the record showed a likelihood that new_england_braidings patent was invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 f
the record showed that george champlin the named inventor worked for the a.w
chesterton_co. chesterton and participated in experiments that developed the invention
one chesterton employee testified that champlin had said when he left to start his own company that he wanted to patent the experimental braiding if chesterton decided not to do so
champlin denied these allegations
id.at 883-84
the key issue was a credibility determination between the witnesses for the two parties
the sufficiency of the communication particularly whether the invention was obvious in light of such disclosure was not at issue
thus new_england_braiding did not incorporate an obviousness test into the ¡± 102 f analysis

applying the correct standard-whether the communication enabled one of ordinary_skill in the art to make the patented_invention-this court discerns insufficient evidence of communication
wittingham testified that he was not sure that he had discussed calibration during dialysis with anyone at gambro and he did not discuss the sensor contamination problem
the trial_judge based his finding of communication solely on wittinghams written proposal
gambro acquired this document when it acquired repgreens technology
during discovery the proposal appeared in the files of one of the named inventors
however as discussed above the proposal does not disclose recalibration during dialysis to one skilled in the art at the relevant time
if the proposal does not disclose recalibration during dialysis it can not serve as the basis for a communication of that idea
thus under the correct legal standard the record_evidence is insufficient to support a finding of communication
the district_court erred in finding communication and conception and hence the finding of derivation is also clearly erroneous

because this court reverses the district_courts ruling of invalidity based on derivation it need not reach the issue of correction of inventorship under 35 u.s.c.¡± 256 1994

ii
obviousness
this court reviews the ultimate_determination of obviousness de novo
see in re donaldson co. 16_f.3d_1189 1192 29_uspq2d_1845 1848 fed.cir.1994
this ultimate_determination however requires underlying factual_findings which this court examines for clear error
see graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 17-18 86_s.ct._684 693-94 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966) ; uniroyal inc. v. rudkin-wiley corp. 837_f.2d_1044 1050 5_uspq2d_1434 1438 fed.cir.1988

the district_court determined that the prior_art embodied each of the elements of claim 1 with the exception of element five-the` transferring_means'
specifically the court found that the prior_art including the ufm 1000 the dm 358 and the german756_patent differed from the gambro_invention only in the absence of computer controlled valves to recalibrate the flow sensors during dialysis
the record amply supports these findings

thus the key obviousness question is whether the prior_art would teach one of ordinary_skill in this art to employ valves for recalibration during dialysis
the district_court found that those skilled in the art were clearly aware of the possibility of recalibrating during dialysis and that substituting a system of computer-controlled valves for the system of hoses in the ufm 1000 and the dm 358 was obvious to those skilled in the art at the time of invention
however the *1579 record must provide a teaching suggestion or reason to substitute computer-controlled valves for the system of hoses in the prior_art
the absence of such a suggestion to combine is dispositive in an obviousness_determination
see smithkline diagnostics inc. v. helena lab corp. 859_f.2d_878 886-87 8_uspq2d_1468 1475 fed.cir.1988

the trial_judge found that the gray and sanderson_article precision differential fluid flow measurement` clearly suggests using a valve_system to bypass or detour clean_dialysate around the dialyzer during the course of a dialysis treatment'
the record_evidence does not support this finding
sanderson himself testified that his article did not disclose the use of valves to bypass the dialyzer but actually taught away from that solution
rather than recalibration by rerouting the clean_dialysate through valves around the dialyzer during dialysis sanderson testified that his clinical device rerouted spent dialysate which has passed through the dialyzer through both the inflow and outflow_sensors
sanderson testified that this configuration was necessary because it was a medical requirement to maintain the flow of dialysis fluid through the dialyzer
thus sanderson testified that his article taught away from recalibration during dialysis by bypassing the dialyzer

the gray and sanderson_article supports this testimony
the article and the clinical trials teach that stopping the fluid flow through the dialyzer for recalibration during dialysis is not possible
the article states` as it was not possible during dialysis therapy to stop the fluid transfer and thus re-establish the zero base line a series of valves were inserted around the flowmeter to enable the flow to be changed to a zero differential flow configuration while at the same_time maintaining dialysis'
further the article explains that because it was not possible to bypass the dialyzer during dialysis` [ t ] he only solution appeared to lie in the adoption of a differential measurement technique where any signal due to the true differential flow could be effectively isolated from that due to the very much larger common mode signal'
thus sandersons use of the valves to direct spent dialysis through both sensors facilitated a proper baseline for testing the accuracy of the improved sensor
contrary to the district_courts finding the gray and sanderson_article teaches away from the use of valves to recalibrate during dialysis by bypassing the dialyzer
without a suggestion or teaching to combine baxters case of obviousness suffers a significant deficiency

in addition the district_court did not evaluate fully the fourth prong of the obviousness_determination-the objective_indicia of nonobviousness
these objective_indicia when present are invariably relevant to a determination under section 103
see stratoflex inc. v. aeroquip corp. 713_f.2d_1530 1538 218_uspq_871 879 fed.cir.1983
these objective_indicia` may often be the most probative and cogent evidence [ of nonobviousness ] in the record'
id

the district_court rejected the evidence of long-felt need and declined to address any other consideration
several objective_indicia however warrant consideration in this case
for instance before this litigation baxter recognized calibration during dialysis as a significant advance
baxter touted the advantages of auto-adjust as it termed automatic recalibration during dialysis in the advertising for the allegedly infringing baxter_sps 550 machines
baxters recognition of the importance of this advance is relevant to a determination of nonobviousness
see allen archery inc. v. browning mfg co. 819_f.2d_1087 1092 2_uspq2d_1490 1493 fed.cir.1987

additionally the record contains significant evidence of the commercial_success of gambros invention
the record shows that baxter sold over 14,800 dialysis machines allegedly incorporating the gambro_invention since 1987
in fact baxter admits that its machines were a commercial_success
of course the record must show a sufficient nexus between this commercial_success and the patented_invention
see demaco corp. v. f. von langsdorff licensing ltd. 851_f.2d_1387 1394 7_uspq2d_1222 1226 fed.cir.1988
the prominence of the patented technology in baxters advertising creates an inference that links the gambro_invention to this success

finally the record also suggests that others in this market had tried to solve the need for improved accuracy of the ultrafiltration *1580 monitors
the record reflects that those skilled in the art tried numerous ultimately unsuccessful solutions-improving the electronics improving the flowmeter technology and recalibrating before dialysis
this objective consideration also supports a conclusion of nonobviousness
see graham 383 u.s. at 17-18 86 s.ct.at 693-94 ; minnesota mining & mfg co. v. johnson & johnson orthopaedics inc. 976_f.2d_1559 1574-75 24_uspq2d_1321 1333-34 fed.cir.1992

in sum the record supplies objective_evidence of nonobviousness including baxters recognition of the importance of this invention evidence of commercial_success and evidence of the failure of others to solve the recognized problem
this objective_evidence combined with the lack of a teaching or suggestion to combine requires a holding of nonobviousness

iii
inequitable conduct
inequitable conduct is the failure to disclose material information or the submission of false material information during prosecution of a patent with an intent to deceive
see kingsdown med consultants ltd. v. hollister inc. 863_f.2d_867 872 9_uspq2d_1384 1389 fed.cir.1988 in banc
under the then relevant standard information is material if a reasonable examiner would consider the omission or misrepresentation important in deciding whether to issue the patent
see fox indus. inc. v. structural preservation sys. inc. 922_f.2d_801 803 17_uspq2d_1579 1580 fed.cir.1990
a reference which merely replicates references already before the examiner however is not material
see halliburton co. v. schlumberger tech corp. 925_f.2d_1435 1440 17_uspq2d_1834 1839 fed.cir.1991
a finding of inequitable_conduct also requires proof of intent to deceive
id.at 1442
the court weighs the intent of the party in light of all evidence including evidence of good_faith
kingsdown 863 f.2d at 876 in banc
the quantum of intent evidence necessary for inequitable_conduct depends in part on the materiality of the information
in the presence of very material omissions or misrepresentations less evidence suffices to show intent
see halliburton 925 f.2d at 1439

this court examines a district_courts inequitable_conduct finding for abuse of discretion
see merck & co. v. danbury pharmacal inc. 873_f.2d_1418 1420 10_uspq2d_1682 1685 fed.cir.1989
the district_courts discretionary finding can not rest on clearly erroneous findings of fact or on a misunderstanding of the law
see manville sales corp. v. paramount sys. inc. 917_f.2d_544 551 16_uspq2d_1587 1592 fed.cir.1990 citing kingsdown 863 f.2d at 872
the trial_judge found that gambro made fatal misrepresentations to the patent and trademark office about the german756_patent
this court rejects that finding as an abuse of discretion

as discussed above the examiner rejected gambros patent application after his initial examination as anticipated by the german756_patent
* the german756_patent discloses a dialysis system with a flowmetric ultrafiltrate measurement
this system manually connects a temporary hose between the intake and outflow_sensors in the position the dialyzer would occupy to pass the same flow by both sensors
the german756_patent does not disclose any way to mount the hose and the dialyzer into the dialysis circuit at the same_time
therefore unlike the patent at issue the german756 does not disclose any means for calibrating during dialysis nor any means for preventing the flow of spent dialysis_solution through the downstream_sensor
without a` transferring_means' recited by the552_patent to recalibrate during dialysis the german756_patent does not anticipate the patented_invention

in response to this rejection however gambro amended claim 1 as follows` transferring_means for preventing the flow of said second fluid through said second_duct while transferring the flow of the first_fluid to said second_duct'
in distinguishing the amended claims over the german756 gambro stated *1581 in the same way the measuring cell 9 [ of the german756_patent ] is at all times influenced only by the contaminated dialysis_solution.. at no time does the german_patent_transfer the clean_dialysis_solution i.e. the first_fluid through the second measuring cell 9 while preventing the flow of the contaminated dialysis_solution i.e. the second solution from flowing therethrough
... as noted the german_patent is totally void of any suggestion of providing a dialyzer where the clean_dialysis_solution is permitted to flow through both the first and second_ducts of the measuring cell
the district_court construed these statements as misrepresentations i agree that gambro misrepresented to the patent_examiner the teachings of the german_patent
gambro informed the patent_examiner that the german_patent does not teach a method for transferring clean_dialysis_solution to the second_flow_sensor` while preventing the flow of the contaminated solution' to that flow sensor
however the german756_patent clearly discloses a means by which a hose can be inserted in place of the dialyzer in order to direct clean_dialysate through both the first and second_flow_sensors
as stated the german756_patent thus describes a method for transferring the same stream of clean_dialysate through both the first and second_flow_sensors
further because the hose directs only clean_dialysate through the second_flow_sensor the german756_patent discloses a means for preventing the flow of contaminated dialysis_solution through the second_flow_sensor
thus gambros statement to the patent_examiner that the german756_patent does not disclose a means to` transfer the clean_dialysis_solution.. through the second measuring cell 9 while preventing the flow of the contaminated dialysis_solution.. from flowing therethrough' misrepresented the german756_patents teachings
( citations to record omitted

this court notes that some of gambros responses are at least over-statements
the german_references down-stream measuring cell is not` at all times influenced only by contaminated dialysis_solution' as the district_court correctly noted
nor is it always accurate that` at no time does the german_patent_transfer the clean_dialysis_solution.. through the second measuring cell'
instead these statements are only correct in the context of an ongoing dialysis process with a dialyzer not the hose system completing the circuit
of central import however is a lack of disclosure in the german_reference for bypassing the dialyzer during dialysis and no disclosure of any means for preventing the flow of spent dialysis_solution through the downstream_sensor during dialysis
thus while gambros statements apply during actual dialysis they are overstatements outside that context
nonetheless in the context of gambros overall effort to show that the german_reference does not anticipate its invention these exaggerations do not rise to the level of gross falsification

in any event inequitable_conduct also requires a finding of intent to deceive
as discussed above all evidence-including evidence of good_faith-informs this inquiry
kingsdown 863 f.2d at 876
in light of the tentative and minor overstatements in this record the evidence of intent must be relatively strong
see halliburton 925 f.2d at 1439
on this record however the evidence of intent is very weak

first gambro had disclosed british patent no._2003,274 repgreen274 which uses the same pre-dialysis hose procedure as the german756
in the response to the office_action gambro specifically stated that german756` describes a system which corresponds to the system of the prior_art mentioned on page 1 of applicants specification'
indeed the552 specification discloses the repgreen274
this disclosure of corresponding prior_art to the examiner-in english to boot-shows gambros good_faith

further the examiner himself had located and cited the german756_patent and could consult it while evaluating gambros comments in response to his office_action
the examiners access to the german and repgreen references should have helped place gambros comments in their proper context

the district_court however overemphasized bobergs gambros in-house_patent_counsels fluency in german
although the patent_examiner relied on gambros translations the process of moving between languages *1582 is not itself sufficient to show that gambro exploited its foreign language expertise to deceive the examiner
the examiner may request translations throughout the examination process
see manual of patent examining procedure mpep ¡± 901.05 d 6th ed.1995

finally the trial_judge relied on` gambros failure to name wittingham as the inventor' as corroborating evidence of an intent to deceive
because gambro did not derive the552 invention from wittingham this evidence is not available to reinforce an intent to deceive
thus the district_courts finding of an intent to deceive rests solely on some exaggerations in gambros response to the initial rejection and the language superiority of gambros counsel
this evidence does not suffice to show the measure of intent necessary for inequitable_conduct in the circumstances of this case
therefore this court discerns in the district_courts determination of inequitable_conduct an abuse of discretion

iv
infringement
the district_court found that the baxter_sps 550 literally infringed claim 1 of gambros patent
however because the district_court also found the patent invalid and unenforceable it entered judgment in favor of baxter on this issue
with its reversal on the invalidity and enforceability grounds this court also reverses the judgment on the claim of infringement
thus baxter infringes claim 1 of the gambro552_patent
finally as this court has reversed the district_court and found against baxter on the issues of invalidity unenforceability and infringement baxter has not and can not meet its burden of proving that this case is exceptional nor that the failure to award costs was an abuse of discretion
thus this court declines to address those issues

statements made in answer to this office_action are therefore material
