opinion
pauline newman circuit_judge
verve llc appeals the decision of the united_states_district_court for the eastern_district of michigan,1 granting summary_judgment that claims 1 6 and 13 of united states patent no._4850,315 the ¡¬315_patent are invalid
we reverse the *1118 judgment with respect to anticipation vacate with respect to indefiniteness and remand for further_proceedings

background
the ¡¬315_patent describes and claims improved push_rods for internal_combustion_engines
push rods are used to actuate rocker arms which open and close the intake and exhaust valves of cylinders of engines designed for their use
in such engines the push_rods ride on cam followers which are raised and lowered by the camshaft as it rotates
as engine speeds have increased so have the number of piston strokes requiring a corresponding increase in the number of valve openings and closings ; this in turn increases the movement of and forces on the push_rods
stronger push_rods became necessary and to lighten their weight hollow push_rods were developed
however there was a need for stronger and stiffer rods that could be manufactured from a single_piece of metal without the need for inserts or other supporting structure

the ¡¬315_patent claims a hollow push_rod whose overall diameter is larger at the middle than at the ends and that has substantially constant_wall_thickness throughout the rod and rounded_seats at the tips
this novel shape is said to provide the advantages of increased strength and stiffness permitting higher engine speeds and greater valve train forces
the ¡¬315_patent illustrates the invention as follows

?
*1119 as seen in the drawings and as required by the claims the push_rod 10¡² is configured whereby the outer_diameter of the middle_portion is larger than the outer_diameter of the end_portions 18_and_20
the end_portions have a rounded tip 52 forming a seat that engages a pocket of a cam follower at one end and a pocket of a rocker arm at the other end
the shape of the push_rod provides increased strength and because it is hollow it is relatively light
since the rounded tips are integrally formed there are no problems with disengagement and the rod is relatively inexpensive to manufacture
claim 1 is representative 1
a push_rod for an internal combustion engine comprising a single_piece of metal in the form of an elongated hollow tube having a middle_portion first and second end_portions and rounded_seats at the tips thereof said middle_portion having a larger outer_diameter than the end_portions and said tube having substantially constant_wall_thickness throughout the length of the tube and the tips thereon
the district_court granted summary_judgment of invalidity on two grounds that the claims are indefinite and that the claimed invention is anticipated

indefiniteness
the district_court found that the expression` substantially constant_wall_thickness' in the claims is not supported in the specification and prosecution_history by a sufficiently clear definition of` substantially'
the court explained in this case judging by the intrinsic record the meaning of` substantially' constant_wall_thickness is unclear
while not the basis of this courts decision the ambiguity of this term was demonstrated at the motion hearing by the plaintiffs willingness to include great variations in wall thickness within the parameters of` substantially' constant_wall_thickness in a manner that renders them without meaning
the court further explained that the word` substantially' was at issue because the parties disputed the scope of` substantially constant_wall_thickness' and that liability for infringement depends on whether` substantially' embraces the accused push_rods
the court recognized that the usage` substantially' may be adequately definite in some cases but ruled that in this case it was indefinite because it was not further defined
the court cited amgen inc. v. chugai pharmaceutical co. 927_f.2d_1200 1218 18_uspq2d_1016 1031 fed.cir.1991 for its statement that` when the meaning of claims is in doubt especially when as is the case here there is close prior_art they are properly declared invalid'

we conclude that the court erred in law in requiring that the intrinsic_evidence of the specification and prosecution_history is the sole source of meaning of words that are used in a technologic context
while reference to intrinsic_evidence is primary in interpreting claims the criterion is the meaning of words as they would be understood by persons in the field of the invention
patent documents are written for persons familiar with the relevant field ; the patentee is not required to include in the specification information readily understood by practitioners lest every patent be required to be written as a comprehensive tutorial and treatise for the generalist instead of a concise statement for persons in the field
thus resolution of any ambiguity arising from the claims and specification may be aided by extrinsic_evidence of usage and meaning of a term in the context of the invention
the question is not whether the word` substantially' *1120 has a fixed meaning as applied to` constant_wall_thickness' but how the phrase would be understood by persons experienced in this field of mechanics upon reading the patent_documents
it may of course occur that persons experienced in a technologic field will have divergent opinions as to the meaning of a term particularly as narrow distinctions are drawn by the parties or warranted by the technology
patent disputes often raise close questions requiring refinement of technical definitions in light of particular facts
the judge will then be obliged to decide between contending positions ; a role familiar to judges
but the fact that the parties disagree about claim scope does not of itself render the claim invalid

expressions such as` substantially' are used in patent_documents when warranted by the nature of the invention in order to accommodate the minor variations that may be appropriate to secure the invention
such usage may well satisfy the charge to` particularly point out and distinctly claim' the invention 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 and indeed may be necessary in order to provide the inventor with the benefit of his invention
in andrew corp. v. gabriel elecs inc. 847_f.2d_819 821-22 6_uspq2d_2010 2013 fed.cir.1988 the court explained that usages such as` substantially equal' and` closely approximate' may serve to describe the invention with precision appropriate to the technology and without intruding on the prior_art
the court again explained in ecolab inc. v. envirochem inc. 264_f.3d_1358 1367 60_uspq2d_1173 1179 fed.cir.2001 that` like the termabout the termsubstantially is a descriptive term commonly used in patent claims toavoid a strict numerical boundary to the specified parameter` quoting pall corp. v. micron separations inc. 66_f.3d_1211 1217 36_uspq2d_1225 1229 fed.cir.1995

it is well established that when the term` substantially' serves reasonably to describe the subject_matter so that its scope would be understood by persons in the field of the invention and to distinguish the claimed subject_matter from the prior_art it is not indefinite
understanding of this scope may be derived from extrinsic_evidence without rendering the claim invalid
the summary_judgment record offered no basis for departing from these general rules
thus the usage` substantially constant_wall_thickness' does not of itself render the claims of the ¡¬315_patent indefinite
the summary_judgment on this ground is vacated ; we remand for further_proceedings including any appropriate recourse to extrinsic_evidence concerning the usage and understanding of the term` substantially' in relevant context

anticipation
invalidity based on` anticipation' requires that the invention is not in fact new
see e.g. hoover group inc. v. custom metalcraft inc. 66_f.3d_299 302 36_uspq2d_1101 1103 fed.cir.1995` lack of novelty often calledanticipation requires that the same invention including each element and limitation of the claims was known or used by others before it was invented by the patentee'
a single reference must describe the claimed invention with sufficient precision and detail to establish that the subject_matter existed in the prior_art
see e.g. in re spada 911_f.2d_705 708 15_uspq2d_1655 1657 fed.cir.1990` the reference must describe the applicants claimed invention sufficiently to have placed a person of ordinary skill in the field of the invention in possession of it'

the district_court also held on summary_judgment that the ¡¬315_invention was invalid for anticipation based on the push *1121 rods shown in two japanese_patents designated jp 635 and jp 808
the japanese_patents show push_rods that are hollow tubes with spherical shaped ends as follows

?
verve stresses that the japanese push_rods are not wider at their mid-portion like the ¡¬315 rods but are of uniform_diameter along their length
the drawings in the japanese_patents and the ¡¬315_patent reflect this distinguishing difference
although the defendants argue that the ball shape at the end of the japanese rods is of narrower diameter than the rest of the rod and thus that the japanese end portion is narrower than the middle_portion the invention as described and claimed in the ¡¬315_patent does not encompass a tube of uniform_diameter along its length whatever the diameter at the rounded tip

the japanese_patents on their face do not show the push_rods of the ¡¬315_patent
no question of material fact is present for neither the structures nor their differences is disputed
on the undisputed facts no reasonable trier of fact could find the ¡¬315_invention anticipated by these japanese references
summary judgment of invalidity on the ground of anticipation is reversed

conclusion
the summary_judgment of invalidity insofar as based on anticipation is reversed
the judgment of invalidity insofar as based on indefiniteness is vacated
no other issues were decided by the district_court
the case is remanded for further_proceedings

reversed in part vacated in part and remanded
