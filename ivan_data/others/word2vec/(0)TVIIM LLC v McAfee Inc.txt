opinion
reyna circuit_judge
tviim llc` tviim' sued mcafee inc.` mcafee' in the united_states_district_court for the northern_district of california for infringement of u.s. patent no._6889,168`168_patent`
a jury determined that mcafee did not infringe the168_patent and that the168_patent was invalid
after the jury_verdict tviim filed motions for judgment as a matter of law` jmol' and for a new_trial
the district_court denied both motions and tviim filed this appeal challenging the jury_verdict and the district_courts denial of its post-verdict motions
we affirm because substantial_evidence supports the jurys findings of non-infringement and invalidity under a uniform_construction of the relevant claim_terms and the district_court did not abuse its discretion in denying a new_trial

background
1
the168_patent
the168_patent is entitled` method and apparatus for assessing the security of a computer'
it describes` a security_system which identifies security_vulnerabilities and discrepancies for a computing_system'
'168_patent col._1,_ll._65-67
the168_patent both identifies potential security threats to a computer and under certain conditions recommends action to a user to stop the threat

*1360 four claims of the168_patent are relevant to this appeal
independent claim 1 recites a security_system for a computer_apparatus wherein said computer_apparatus includes a processor and system_memory said security_system comprising at least one security module which under direction from the processor accesses and analyzes selected portions of the computer_apparatus to identify vulnerabilities ; at least one utility module which under the direction from the processor performs various_utility_functions with regards to the computer_apparatus in response to the identified vulnerabilities ; and
a security_system_memory which contains security information for performing the analysis of the computer_apparatus
'168_patent col._10,_l._65 to col._11,_l._10 disputed terms emphasized

dependent_claim 7 recites the security_system of claim 1 wherein the security modules include at least one of.. an integrity checking module which analyzes files in the system_memory to identify system vulnerabilities ; a network checking module which analyzes the computer_apparatus to identify vulnerabilities created as a result of the computer_apparatus connecting with a data network ; and
a password checking module which analyzes passwords for users of the computer_apparatus to identify vulnerabilities
id
col._11,_ll._25-46 disputed term emphasized

dependent_claim 9 recites` the security_system of claim 7 wherein the system_memory comprises a list of known vulnerabilities which may be employed by the integrity checking module'
id
col._11,_ll._62-64

finally independent claim 11 recites a method of providing a security_assessment for a computer_system which includes a system_memory comprising the steps of providing a security_subsystem in the computer_system such that functionality of the security_subsystem is directed through a processor for the computer_system wherein the security performs steps comprising identifying a configuration of the system ; accessing the system_memory and performing at least one procedure to provide a security_assessment for at least one aspect of the computer_system ; as a result of any vulnerabilities discovered in the assessment identifying corrective_measures to be taken with regards to the computer_system ; reporting the discovered vulnerability and the identified corrective_measures ; and
upon receiving an appropriate command initiating the corrective_measures
id
col._12,_ll._1-18 disputed terms emphasized

mcafee
mcafee developed` program_updates' for microsoft windows users to protect software programs against new security threats
program_updates detects and installs updates for numerous non-windows programs such as apple itunes and adobe acrobat
to do so it scans a users computer to determine whether any of the non-windows programs are installed
if it detects such a program program_updates makes two determinations 1 whether the *1361 national vulnerability database` nvd' lists any vulnerabilities in the currently installed version of that program ; and 2 whether an update is available
if an update is available program_updates will install the update

prior to installing an update program_updates does not provide users with a detailed report of security threats ; rather it tells the user whether an update is` critical' or merely` recommended'
j.a
2044-46 3338
if an update is available program_updates will install the available_update whether or not the nvd lists any known vulnerabilities
by contrast if no software_update is available program_updates will not take action even if it detects a vulnerability
without an available_update program_updates will not provide users with any information about a detected_vulnerability
j.a
2047-48
to summarize the presence of a known vulnerability is irrelevant to whether program_updates installs an update

3
prior art
at trial mcafee argued that two prior_art references anticipated the168_patent and in the alternative that their combination would have rendered the168_patent obvious

the first reference hostguard is a software program developed by several named inventors of the168_patent
hostguard first detects computer security threats and then reports them to the user
j.a
1090 3796-97
these detailed reports include file names and locations the particular nature of the vulnerability and steps the user can take to combat the threat
hostguard requires the user to decide whether to take corrective_action
thus the user not hostguard itself takes any desired corrective_action
j.a
3796

the second reference system security scanner` s3' is a` security_assessment tool' that` evaluates system vulnerabilities from the inside'
j.a
3799
s3 allows a user to select which specific_vulnerabilities to assess and then provides a` detailed description' of detected vulnerabilities to the user
j.a
3816 3801 3836
for example it offers a` long description' report that identifies` bugs' that create exploitable weaknesses in the system
j.a
2610-11 ; see also j.a
2293 testimony that s3 provides users with reports on` specific_vulnerabilities found on specific computers'
s3 does not fix vulnerabilities itself ; rather it requires a user to open a new window and take corrective_action

district court proceedings
tviim sued mcafee in 2013 alleging that program_updates infringed the168_patent
mcafee counterclaimed for declarations of non-infringement invalidity and inequitable_conduct

mcafee moved for summary_judgment that hostguard anticipated the asserted claims of the168_patent
in its motion mcafee argued that all claim_terms should be given their plain and ordinary_meaning
in its opposition tviim asked the district_court to construe only one term` vulnerability'
the district_court denied mcafees motion on anticipation because material issues of fact remained for trial
the district_court also ruled that` vulnerability' should` have its plain and ordinary_meaning and is not limited in scope topre-existing security problems or vulnerabilities'
j.a
567
the court then asked for supplemental briefing on the plain and ordinary_meaning of` vulnerability'
the parties agreed that a` vulnerability' is an` exploitable weakness in a computer_system'
j.a
633
the court adopted that construction and asked if it needed to construe any other terms
both parties said no further construction was necessary

*1362 the case went to trial and the jury returned a verdict that 1 mcafee did not infringe the168_patent ; 2 the168_patent was invalid ; and 3 tviim did not obtain the168_patent through inequitable_conduct
the jurys general verdict of invalidity did not distinguish between obviousness and anticipation
the inequitable_conduct issue is not subject to this appeal

tviim filed motions for jmol and a new_trial arguing that the jury had rendered an inconsistent_verdict
according to tviim the jury could not have arrived at both a non-infringement and invalidity_determination using a single_construction of three claim_terms` as a result of/in response to' ;` various_utility_functions' ; and` reporting the discovered vulnerabilities'
tviim concedes that it did not seek construction of any of these terms before or during trial
opening_br.at 70

the district_court denied tviims motions
it found that the jurys verdict was not inconsistent because substantial_evidence supported both a non-infringement and invalidity_verdict under a single_construction of all three claim_terms

non-infringement and invalidity
claim terms must be construed the same way for the purpose of determining invalidity and infringement

a district_courts determination that a claim_term has a`plain and ordinary_meaning may be inadequate when [ the claim ] term has more than oneordinary_meaning
`` o2 micro int l ltd. v. beyond innovation tech co. 521_f.3d_1351 1361 fed
cir
2008

we first address tviims argument that the jury rendered an inconsistent *1363 verdict of infringement and invalidity because the claim_terms` as a result of/in response to'` various_utility_functions' and` reporting the discovered vulnerabilities' have more than one ordinary_meaning
we note that tviim did not seek construction of any of the three terms at trial
it never presented multiple_ordinary_meanings of the three terms or showed that they are open to varying interpretations
we are not persuaded that any of the three terms has multiple_ordinary_meanings and we discern no error in the district_court submitting them to the jury without specific instruction
tviim argues that it is not seeking a new claim construction of any terms on appeal
to be sure it has waived any new construction
`` [ a ] party may not introduce new claim construction arguments on appeal or alter the scope of the claim construction positions it took below
moreover litigants waive their right to present new claim construction disputes if they are raised for the first time after trial'

broadcom corp. v. qualcomm inc. 543_f.3d_683 694 fed
cir

we next address whether substantial_evidence supports the jurys verdict of non-infringement based on using the same construction it used for its invalidity_verdict
see harper 533 f.3d at 1021
we conclude that the jury_verdict is supported by substantial_evidence

a
`` as a result of/in response to' there was no dispute at trial that the term` as a result of/in response to' requires a causal_relationship between corrective_action and the discovered vulnerability
mcafees expert_dr._rubin testified that program_updates installs software_updates regardless of whether a vulnerability exists and that the only requirement for update installation is the availability of an update
j.a
2444` the only determining factor whether program_updates will update software is if theres an update available`
in other_words the presence of a vulnerability is irrelevant to whether program_updates installs a software_update
as a result with program_updates there is no causal_relationship between corrective_action and the discovered vulnerability
we find dr._rubins testimony on this point to be substantial_evidence supporting the jurys non-infringement verdict

we also find that substantial_evidence supports the jury_verdict of invalidity based on anticipation
dr._rubin testified that the prior_art anticipated the168_patent by initiating corrective_action in response to a detected_vulnerability
see e.g. j.a
2476 explaining how hostguard discloses the` as a result of any vulnerabilities' limitation of claim 11 ; j.a
2494 concluding that s3 anticipates claim 1
tviim insists that the jury failed to distinguish` all' vulnerabilities from` potential' vulnerabilities
but tviim failed to clarify its position during claim construction
moreover the jury was free to credit dr._rubins testimony that hostguard and s3 anticipate claims 1_and_11 even in the face of opposing arguments from tviim
we thus find dr._rubins testimony to be substantial_evidence supporting the jurys invalidity_determination

b
`` various utility functions' tviim and mcafee presented competing expert_testimony on infringement
tviims expert dr. garuba testified that program_updates satisfies the` various_utility_functions' term by performing four functions identifying the threat accessing *1364 the update downloading the update and installing the update
j.a
2123-24
mcafees expert_dr._rubin disagreed and testified that program_updates performs only one function-downloading software_updates via multiple steps
j.a
2445` [ t ] he only thing that [ program_updates ] does is it updates the programs
`` ; see also j.a
2454-55
given the conflicting expert_testimony we find that a reasonable_mind might accept dr._rubins testimony over dr. garubas
thus substantial_evidence supports the jurys verdict of non-infringement
see versata software inc. v. sap am. inc. 717_f.3d_1255 1263 fed
cir
2013 affirming jury award as supported by substantial_evidence despite competing expert_testimony

dr._rubins testimony also supports the jurys invalidity_verdict for anticipation
he explained how s3 performs` different utility functions'
j.a
2493
tviim expert eric knight also testified that hostguard` corrected at a minimum ownership and permission' i.e. different functions
j.a
2620
thus the testimony that the prior_art and168_patent both perform multiple functions constitutes substantial_evidence in support of the jurys verdict of invalidity

given the testimony at trial we find that a uniform_construction of` various_utility_functions' would allow the jury to arrive at verdicts of non-infringement and invalidity as both are supported by substantial_evidence

c.` reporting the discovered vulnerabilities' at trial tviim argued that program_updates infringes` reporting the discovered vulnerabilities' by providing a` risk_rating' to users prior to installation i.e. whether a particular update is` critical' or simply` recommended'
when pressed about what vulnerability information is provided to users by program_updates tviims expert dr. yu responded` [ n ] othing more than just a risk_rating'
j.a
2046
in other_words although program_updates reports the risk level to the user it does not report any specific information on vulnerabilities
dr._rubin testified that such a risk_rating does not constitute` reporting the discovered vulnerabilities' because program_updates does not report` something like a [ common vulnerabilities and exposures ] number or a specific description of the vulnerability'
j.a
2455
program_updates will not report any detected_vulnerability to a user if no update is available
we find this testimony to be substantial_evidence supporting the jurys non-infringement verdict

regarding invalidity for anticipation the record demonstrates that unlike program_updates hostguard and s3 provide users with specific reports on detected vulnerabilities
see e.g. j.a
2478 dr._rubin` so here we see the actual vulnerability is described' [ in s3 ] ; j.a
3796 hostguard brochure describing` reports [ that ] are written in plain english and are formatted to effectively communicate the results of the security_assessment' ; j.a
3841-78 examples of` vulnerability descriptions' in s31 program_updates by contrast does not provide any detailed vulnerability descriptions
j.a
2002 2046 2455
given this evidence presented we find that the jury_verdict of invalidity is supported by substantial_evidence

*1365 as with the other two terms tviim has not persuaded us that a jury could not arrive at a non-infringement and invalidity_verdict based on a single_construction of` reporting the discovered vulnerabilities'
because substantial_evidence supports the jurys verdicts the district_court did not abuse its discretion by denying tviims motion for a new_trial

2
any potential error in claim construction was harmless
on appeal tviim concedes that substantial_evidence supports the jurys finding for either non-infringement or invalidity but argues it does not support both
opening_br.at 73` [ a ] ny single_ordinary_meaning_construction could support either infringement or invalidity'
( emphasis omitted ; see also j.a
2638 tviims counsel stating at trial` i think theres questions of fact with respect to infringement
``

thus by tviims own admission the jurys invalidity_determination could be proper under` any single_ordinary_meaning_construction'
opening br
73
this concession is determinative because even if we were to find an inconsistent_verdict substantial_evidence under` any' construction supports the jurys verdict of invalidity
consequently any potential error by the jury regarding non-infringement was harmless
cf
senju pharm co. v. lupin ltd. 780_f.3d_1337 1353 fed
cir
2015 affirming the district_courts invalidity_finding and therefore not reaching non-infringement arguments ; mobilemedia ideas llc v. apple inc. 780_f.3d_1159 1173 fed
cir
2015 holding that because the patent was invalid the court` need not reach apples argument that its accused iphones do not infringe'

conclusion
the jurys findings of non-infringement and invalidity under a single_construction of all three disputed claim_terms are supported by substantial_evidence
even if error occurred in the jurys verdict of infringement we agree with mcafee that substantial_evidence supports the jurys invalidity_finding
this renders any error harmless
in light of these findings we hold that the district_courts denial of tviims motion for jmol is supported by substantial_evidence and that the district_court did not abuse its discretion in denying tviims motion for a new_trial
we therefore affirm
