opinion
moore circuit_judge poweroasis inc. and poweroasis_networks llc poweroasis appeal the united_states_district_court for the district of new_hampshires grant of summary_judgment that claims 15 18 31 35 38 40 and 49 asserted_claims of u.s. patent nos._6466,658658_patent and 6,721,400400_patent are invalid as anticipated under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b
in reaching its decision the district_court concluded that none of the asserted_claims of the two patents were entitled under 35 u.s.c.¡± 120 to the benefit of the filing_date of poweroasiss original_application because the earlier_application did not provide a written description of the invention claimed in the asserted patents as required by 35 u.s.c.¡± 112
we affirm the grant of summary_judgment of invalidity with respect to all asserted_claims

background
the two poweroasis_patents at issue the ¡¬658_patent and the ¡¬400_patent poweroasis_patents are directed to vending machines that sell telecommunications_access
the poweroasis_patents contain virtually identical specifications
the stated purpose of the poweroasis_patents is to provide a` vending machine' that enables a customer to connect a laptop to a telecommunications channel
the ¡¬658 and ¡¬400_patent s list filing_dates of november 6 2001 and october 15 2002 respectively
the ¡¬658 and ¡¬400_patent s stem from a series of continuation and continuation-in-part_applications
the first application in the patent chain original_application was filed on february 6 1997 and ultimately issued as u.s. patent no._5812,643643_patent
poweroasis does not assert the ¡¬643_patent in this litigation

poweroasis filed a continuation application on september 18 1998 which was later abandoned and on june_15,_2000 it filed a continuation-in-part_application 2000 cip_application which issued as u.s. patent no._6314,169169_patent
the ¡¬169_patent is not asserted by poweroasis in this litigation
the 2000 cip_application added considerable new language to the specification which the district_court characterized as` substantial new_matter'
poweroasis inc. v. t-mobile *1302 usa inc. no._05- cv-42-pb 2007_wl_962937 at *2 d.n.h
mar._30,_2007

poweroasis subsequently filed the two applications that led directly to the two patents asserted in this suit first the ¡¬658_patent then the ¡¬400_patent
poweroasis sued t-mobile for patent infringement alleging that t-mobiles wireless` hotspot network' 1 infringes claims 15 18 31 35 38 40 and 49 of both poweroasis_patents
each of the asserted_claims depends from independent claim 1 which is not asserted by poweroasis
except for minor variations in the language of the independent claims that do not relate to the issues on appeal the language of the asserted_claims is identical in both poweroasis_patents
independent claim 1 recites

1
a vending machine for vending telecommunications channel access to a customer said vending machine comprising a payment mechanism for obtaining information from the customer to initiate a vending transaction ; a customer_interface for indicating the status of said vending machine ; an electronic_circuit for determining when the vending transaction is completed ; a telecommunications_channel_access_circuit adapted to be connected to at least one external_telecommunications_channel for enabling access to the at least one external_telecommunications_channel at the beginning of a vending transaction and disabling access at the end of the vending transaction ; a telecommunications channel access connector connected to said telecommunications_channel_access_circuit for enabling connection to an external telecommunications device of the customer ; and
a control_unit having a device for receiving payment information from the customer and for controlling said electronic_circuit and said telecommunications_channel_access_circuit
the parties had agreed that` customer_interface' is` an interface that enables information to be passed between a human user and hardware or software components of a system' but disagreed about the location of the customer_interface
poweroasis argued that the` customer_interface' may occur on a customers laptop
t-mobile argued that the customer_interface must be located on the vending machine itself
relying entirely on new language added to the 2000 cip_application the district_court adopted poweroasiss proposed construction that the claim_term` customer_interface' encompasses an interface that is located on the customers laptop

in light of the district_courts construction of` customer_interface' t-mobile filed a motion for summary_judgment that the asserted_claims were anticipated by the mobilestar_network
it is undisputed that prior to june_15,_1999 mobilestar_networks inc. a company acquired by t-mobile in 2002 developed deployed publicly used and offered for sale the mobilestar_network which was a high-speed wireless data network that connected users to the internet
it is also undisputed that prior to june_15,_1999 the mobilestar_network contained all of the same *1303 features that form the basis of poweroasiss allegation that the t-mobile_hotspot_network infringes its patents
t-mobile argued therefore that this public_use sale and offer for sale more than one year prior to the june_15,_2000_filing_date of the 2000 cip_application2 constituted ¡± 102 b prior_art which anticipated the poweroasis_patents
35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b
poweroasis responded by claiming its asserted_claims should have the benefit of priority going all the way back to the filing_date of its original_application february 6 1997 which would antedate the mobilestar_network

on summary_judgment the district_court determined that the asserted_claims were not entitled to the priority_date of the original_application because the written description of the original_application did not support the later issued claims
the district_court noted that to arrive at the broad_construction it accorded the` customer_interface' it relied` exclusively' on the new_matter that was added to the 2000 cip_application
poweroasis 2007_wl_962937 at *8
because the district_court concluded that the ¡¬658 and ¡¬ 400 patents are not entitled to the effective_filing_date of the original_application the district_court granted the motion for summary_judgment of invalidity
this appeal followed

discussion
we review the grant of summary_judgment de novo
liebel-flarsheim co. v. medrad inc. 481_f.3d_1371 1377 fed.cir.2007
summary judgment is not appropriate if the dispute about a material_fact is` genuine' that is if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party
anderson v. liberty lobby inc. 477_u.s._242 248 106_s.ct._2505 91_l.ed.2d_202_(1986)

poweroasis appeals two aspects of the district_courts summary_judgment determination
first poweroasis argues that the district_court erred when it placed the burden of proof on poweroasis to show that it is entitled to the priority_date of the original_application
second poweroasis argues that the district_court erred in concluding that the disclosure of the original_application does not provide a written description adequate to support the asserted_claims of the ¡¬658 and ¡¬400_patent s. see 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
1
poweroasis contends that at a minimum there is a genuine_issue of material_fact which prevents summary_judgment of invalidity
we consider each issue in turn

i
burden of proof
it is well established that a patent is presumed valid and` the burden of persuasion to the contrary is and remains on the party asserting invalidity'
ralston_purina_co. v. far-mar-co inc. 772_f.2d_1570 1573 fed.cir.1985
the district_court acknowledged a challenged patent is entitled to a presumption of validity but questioned whether the presumption of validity extends to the question of priority
the district_court concluded that` when a dispute arises concerning whether a cip patent is entitled to priority to the date of the original_application and the patent office has not addressed the issue the burden of proof ordinarily should rest with the party claiming priority to the date of the original_application'
poweroasis 2007_wl_962937 at *8
accordingly the district_court held that poweroasis had the burden of proving that it is entitled to claim priority to the filing_date of the original_application
id

*1304 poweroasis contends that the party asserting invalidity must always bear the burden of proof as to whether claims in a patent_application are entitled to the priority_date of a parent_application
poweroasis relies on this courts decision in ralston for support of its position that the party attacking validity bears the burden to show that claims stemming from a cip_application are not entitled to an earlier_filing_date
in short poweroasis argues the presumption of validity should include a presumption that claims in a cip are all entitled to the earliest effective_filing_date.3 in ralston both the u.s. patent and trademark office pto and the board of patent appeals and interferences board made a priority determination
ralston_purina_co. v. far-mar-co. inc. 586_f.supp._1176 1189 1212 d.kan.1984
ralston involved an appeal related to u.s. patent no._3940,495 which issued from a continuation of application serial no._6 00,471 filed december 9 1966 1966 cip_application which was a continuation-in-part of application serial no._3 81,853 filed july_10,_1964
id.at 1185
in ralston the 1966 cip_application had been the subject of an interference which awarded the inventor the benefit of his earliest application in a detailed opinion by the board
id.at 1189 1213
the district_court in ralston properly accorded deference to the boards decision on priority
see id.at 1213

additionally the ¡± 102 a prior_art on which the defendant in ralston relied was brought to the attention of the examiner during prosecution
see id.at 1212
`` when an attacker simply goes over the same ground travelled [ sic ] by the pto part of the burden is to show that the pto was wrong in its decision to grant the patent'
am
hoist & derrick co. v. sowa & sons 725_f.2d_1350 1360 fed.cir.1984 emphasis in original
this court has explained that when no prior_art other than that which was considered by the pto examiner is relied on by the attacker he has the added burden of overcoming the deference that is due to a qualified government agency presumed to have properly done its job which includes one or more examiners who are assumed to have some expertise in interpreting the references and to be familiar from their work with the level of skill in the art and whose duty it is to issue only valid patents
id.at 1359
in ralston accordingly the defendant had the added burden of overcoming the deference due to the pto

in contrast to ralston in this case the pto did not at any point make any determination with regard to the priority_date of the various claims of the asserted patents
there was no interference in this case related to the asserted patents or the 2000 cip_application that awarded poweroasis the benefit of priority for its original_application nor was there any determination of priority during prosecution incident to a rejection
the mobilestar_network_prior_art was never considered by the examiner
in fact in this case the pto did not make a determination regarding the priority_date for the asserted_claims with respect to any reference

*1305 in the absence of an interference or rejection which would require the pto to make a determination of priority the pto does not make such findings as a matter of course in prosecution.4 the ptos own procedures indicate that examiners do not make priority determinations except where necessary

unless the filing_date of the earlier_nonprovisional_application is actually needed for example in the case of an interference or to overcome a reference there is no need for the office to make a determination as to whether the requirement of 35 u.s.c.¡± 120 that the earlier_nonprovisional_application discloses the invention of the second_application in the manner provided by the first paragraph of 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 is met and whether a substantial portion for all of the earlier_nonprovisional_application is repeated in the second_application in a continuation-in-part
m.p.e.p. seventh ed
( july 1998 at ¡± 201.08
when neither the pto nor the board has previously considered priority there is simply no reason to presume that claims in a cip_application are entitled to the effective_filing_date of an earlier filed application
since the pto did not make a determination regarding priority there is no finding for the district_court to defer to
of course the fact that the mobilestar_network_prior_art was never before the pto does not change the presumption of validity or who has the burden of proof with respect to the prima_facie_case of invalidity
see am
hoist 725 f.2d at 1360
t-mobile the party asserting invalidity must still show by clear and convincing_evidence that the asserted patent is invalid
once it has established a prima_facie_case of invalidity and its burden is met` the party relying on validity is then obligated to come forward with evidence to the contrary'
ralston 772 f.2d at 1573

t-mobile established its prima_facie_case of invalidity with respect to the asserted_claims
it is undisputed that the mobilestar_network was in public_use more than one year prior to the june_15,_2000_filing_date of the cip_application
poweroasis conceded that the mobilestar_network would infringe the claims of the ¡¬658 and ¡¬400_patent s if it were in operation today
`` [ t ] hat which would literally infringe if later in time anticipates if earlier'
schering corp. v. geneva pharms. inc. 339_f.3d_1373 1379 fed.cir.2003 internal citation omitted
accordingly poweroasis has conceded that unless the asserted_claims are accorded an earlier_filing_date than the 2000 cip_application the mobilestar_network is ¡± 102 b prior_art
once t-mobile established by clear and convincing_evidence that the mobilestar_network was ¡± 102 b prior_art to the asserted_claims of the ¡¬658 and ¡¬400_patent s the burden was on poweroasis to come forward with evidence to the contrary
the district_court therefore correctly placed the burden on poweroasis to come forward with evidence to prove entitlement *1306 to claim priority to an earlier_filing_date

ii
written description requirement
application of the written description_requirement is central to the resolution of this appeal
`` it is elementary patent law that a patent_application is entitled to the benefit of the filing_date of an earlier filed application only if the disclosure of the earlier_application provides support for the claims of the later application as required by 35 u.s.c.¡± 112'
in re chu 66_f.3d_292 297 fed.cir.1995 ; see also augustine med. inc. v. gaymar indus. inc. 181_f.3d_1291 1302-03 fed.cir.1999` different claims of [ a cip ] application may therefore receive different_effective_filing_dates.. subject matter that arises for the first_time in [ a ] cip_application does not receive the benefit of the filing_date of the parent_application
``

to satisfy the written description_requirement the disclosure of the prior_application must` convey with reasonable clarity to those skilled in the art that as of the filing_date sought [ the inventor ] was in possession of the invention'
vas-cath inc. v. mahurkar 935_f.2d_1555 1563-64 fed.cir.1991 emphasis in original
while a prior_application need not contain precisely the same words as are found in the asserted_claims see eiselstein v. frank 52_f.3d_1035 1038 fed.cir.1995 ; purdue pharma lp v. faulding inc. 230_f.3d_1320 1323 fed.cir.2000 holding that the disclosure does not have to provide in haec verba support in order to satisfy the written description_requirement the prior_application must indicate to a person skilled in the art that the inventor was` in possession' of the invention as later claimed
ralston 772 f.2d at 1575 ; see also janice m. mueller patent misuse through the capture of industry standards 17 berkeley tech
l.j
623 638 2002` the [ written description ] requirement operates as a timing mechanism to ensure fair play in the presentation of claims after the original filing_date and to guard against manipulation of that process by the patent applicant`
`` entitlement to a filing_date does not extend to subject matter which is not disclosed but would be obvious over what is expressly disclosed'
in re huston 308_f.3d_1267 1277 fed.cir.2002 quoting lockwood v. am
airlines inc. 107_f.3d_1565 1571-72 fed.cir.1997
in lockwood we held while the meaning of terms phrases or diagrams in a disclosure is to be explained or interpreted from the vantage point of one skilled in the art all the limitations must appear in the specification
the question is not whether a claimed invention is an obvious variant of that which is disclosed in the specification
rather a prior_application itself must describe an invention and do so in sufficient detail that one skilled in the art can clearly conclude that the inventor invented the claimed invention as of the filing_date sought
107 f.3d at 1572
we have explained that to satisfy the written description_requirement` the missing descriptive matter must necessarily be present in the [ original ] applications specification such that one skilled in the art would recognize such a disclosure'
tronzo v. biomet inc. 156_f.3d_1154 1159 fed.cir.1998 ; see also martin v. mayer 823_f.2d_500 505 fed.cir.1987 holding that the written description_requirement is` not a question of whether one skilled in the art might be able to construct the patentees device from the teachings of the disclosure.. rather it is a question whether the application necessarily discloses that particular device' emphasis in original
this requires that the written description actually or inherently disclose the claim element
see *1307 turbocare div
of demag delaval turbomachinery corp. v. gen. elec co. 264_f.3d_1111 1118-20 fed.cir.2001 holding that to comply with the written description_requirement the location of the spring must be actually or inherently disclosed ; that the location may be obvious from the disclosure is not enough ; tronzo 156 f.3d at 1159 holding a claim invalid for failure to satisfy the written description_requirement when the specification did not disclose all cup shapes literally or` inherently'
compliance with the written description_requirement is a question of fact but is amenable to summary_judgment in cases where no reasonable fact finder could return a verdict for the non-moving party
see invitrogen corp. v. clontech labs. inc. 429_f.3d_1052 1072-73 fed.cir.2005

entitlement to the filing_date of the original_application would allow poweroasis to antedate mobilestar_network thereby removing it as a reference against the claims
the only evidence poweroasis came forward with to antedate the mobilestar_network was the original_application and the declaration of its expert_witness
the district_court analyzed both the original_application and the declaration of poweroasiss expert_witness and held that the asserted_claims of the ¡¬658 and ¡¬400_patent s are only entitled to the filing_date of the 2000 cip_application because poweroasis did not prove it was` in possession' of the claimed invention when it filed its original_application

in this case the district_courts determination that the original_application does not provide a written description of` customer_interface' as set forth in the asserted_claims is correct
the original_application described a vending machine with a` display' or` user_interface' as part of the vending machine rather than a vending machine with a` customer_interface' located on a customers electronic_device
the 2000 cip_application added language describing a vending machine with a user_interface located remotely from the vending machine such as on a users laptop as shown by the relevant new specification language underlined in the passages below:5

the microprocessor also communicates with the customer via a user_interface to provide details on the progress of the transaction
the user_interface is not particularly limited and need not even include a visual_display on the vending machine
¡¬169_patent col.2 l.66-col.3 l.3
once attached and initiated the customer can monitor the state of the vending machine and the transaction via the user_interface
the user_interface may be a visual_display or some other type of progress indicator such as an auditory signal
for example the vending machine could instruct or inform the user via an audio speaker
alternatively the user_interface can be present inside or uploaded to the users laptop or other device thereby obviating the need for an interface within the vending machine_unit
similarly the use of a card access system which prevents usage by ejecting the users card would also obviate the need for a visual or aural interface
id.at col.6 ll.7-19
another object of this invention is portability
using an internal power source and wireless telecommunications channels this invention is not limited to a fixed location
in this configuration the invention could be used at fairs outdoor concerts and similar sites where permanent installations are not cost effective
in these cases it might be more cost *1308 effective to have one control_unit operating multiple vending machines
these multiple vending machines may be arranged in the form of a kiosk to allow multiple customers access to the vending machine at the same time
similarly almost any combination of functional_components of the vending machine could be moved to a location remote from the machine
this could be accomplished for example by networking a cluster of machines to a server either on site or at a remote location
id.at col.4 ll.17-31
the 2000 cip_application also substituted the term` customer_interface' for the claim_term` display' in claim 1 and added several independent claims disclosing a` vending machine' with component parts` located remote from said vending machine'
the district_court stated that it` can not find a single reference in the written description which suggests that poweroasis understood its invention to include the new_matter that it claimed for the first_time in the cip_application'
poweroasis 2007_wl_962937 at *9
we agree
all of the references from the original_application that poweroasis identifies as allegedly providing written description support for the later-issued claims are to a` user_interface' that is part of a unitary_vending_machine

all of the original_applications embodiments that include the user_interface describe a physical display that is a part of the vending machine
as shown in figure 2` [ t ] he customer sees an operating panel 101 with a user_interface 110 comprising two lights referred to as ready and available'
¡¬643_patent_col.6 ll.27-29

?
`` [ i ] n the preferred embodiment of fig._2 the user_interface [ 110 ] consists of two lights which turn on and off in particular patterns to inform the customer as to how the transaction is processing'
id.at col.6 ll.59-63
the only depiction of the user_interface 110 is depicted as part of the vending machine
`` when the customer first approaches the vending machine 100 the ready light is on'
id.at col.6 ll.35-36 emphasis added

*1309 poweroasis argues that the user_interface` could take any number of possible forms'
appellant br
24
to be sure the specification describes other_embodiments for the user_interface
for example` these lights may be replaced or augmented by a video_display_unit vdu which provides more detailed instruction to the customer on vending machine operation and detailed information on the progress of the transaction including accumulated charges'
¡¬643_patent_col.6 ll.63-67
the vdu` could be combined with a keyboard or other push-buttons that would allow the customer to set the language for the display the connectors to be activated and optionally when to terminate the transaction'
id.at col.7 ll.1-5
in other_embodiments` the user_interface includes a printer or similar device to provide the customer with a receipt for the transaction'
id.at col.7 ll.8-10
while the original_application discloses multiple embodiments of the` user_interface' all such embodiments make the user_interface part of the unitary_vending_machine apparatus
there is simply no disclosure in the original_application of a user_interface that is either located on a customers laptop or even separate from the vending machine itself

indeed although figure 5 of the original_application depicts a laptop hooked up to the vending machine the figure shows that the user_interface is clearly located on the vending machine and not the laptop

?
id.at fig.5
in figure 5 of the original_application a laptop computer is connected to the operating panel of the vending machine 501 which is mounted on the wall
the` user_interface' is represented by the video_display_unit 510 which is located on the operating panel of the vending machine 502 and not on the laptop
therefore we agree with the district_court that the original_application did not contain support for a` customer_interface' located on the customers laptop which was the claim construction urged by poweroasis and adopted by the district_court

this broad_construction is supported only by the material added in the 2000 cip_application
in fact poweroasis cited only to language first introduced in the 2000 cip_application to support this broad_construction 1` the user_interface is not particularly limited and need not even include a visual_display on the vending machine'
*1310 ¡¬658_patent col.3 ll.3-5 and ¡¬400_patent col.3 ll.7-9 ; 2` alternatively the user_interface can be present inside or uploaded to the users laptop thereby obviating the need for an interface within the vending machine_unit'
¡¬658_patent col.6 ll.15-18 and ¡¬400_patent col.6 ll.20-23 ; and
( 3` [ a ] lmost any combination of functional_components of the vending machine could be moved to a location remote from the machine'
¡¬658_patent col.4 l.30 and ¡¬400_patent col.4 l.33
because none of this support was present in the original_application and because the original_application did not disclose a customer_interface apart from the vending machine the asserted_claims are only entitled to the 2000 cip_application filing_date of june_15,_2000
since it is undisputed that the mobilestar_network was in public_use more than one year prior to this date the asserted_claims are invalid

further we agree with the district_court that poweroasiss conclusory expert declaration was not sufficient to raise a genuine_issue of material_fact regarding whether the original_application disclosed to one skilled in the art a customer_interface located on a customer_laptop
the district_court determined and we agree that mr. morley does not cite in a persuasive way any supporting references in the original_application
he does not demonstrate how at the time of the filing_date of the original_application poweroasis was in possession of the claimed invention which uses a customers electronic_device e.g. a laptop to achieve the customer_interface
he does not show anywhere in the original_application where a customer_interface is located on a customers laptop either expressly or inherently
his declaration points to figures and discussions of the user_interface in the original_application each of which is to a user_interface on the vending machine
he goes on to say it is` well known to those of ordinary skill as of february 6 1997 that the functionality of providing information to a customer via a user_interface can be provided by displaying information on a computer screen such as on a portable computer of the type referred to in the ¡¬643_patent when that computer is connected to a network of other components and computers'
this is not a claim that use of a customer_laptop as the customer_interface is necessarily disclosed by the original_application
at best this is a statement that it would be obvious to substitute a customer_laptop for the user_interface disclosed on the vending machine
obviousness simply is not enough ; the subject matter must be disclosed to establish possession
see turbocare 264 f.3d at 1119 ; tronzo 156 f.3d at 1159 ; lockwood 107 f.3d at 1571-72
therefore the declaration by poweroasiss expert does not raise a genuine_issue of material_fact over whether the original_application established that the inventor possessed the invention as later claimed which includes a customer_interface located on a customer_laptop apart from the vending machine

finally despite the fact that the district_court adopted the very construction urged by poweroasis for` customer_interface' on appeal poweroasis argues that a different construction ought to be used for validity purposes
poweroasiss argument boils down to a claim that poweroasis is entitled to a broad_claim_construction for purposes of infringement and a different_narrower_claim_construction for purposes of validity

poweroasis contends that as long as the claim_term` customer_interface' was supported by the original_application then the claims are entitled to the effective_filing_date of the *1311 original_application
however the construction of` customer_interface' that must be supported by the written description of the original_application is the construction given by the district_court for the term as used in the ¡¬658 and ¡¬400_patent s. that the original_application may support a narrower construction of` customer_interface' as a display on the vending machine does not mean that the original_application supports the broader construction of a` customer_interface' as an interface located on the customers laptop remote from the vending machine
`` [ t ] he invention is for purposes of thewritten description inquiry whatever is now claimed'
vas-cath 935 f.2d at 1564 emphasis in original
since the original_application does not support a` customer_interface' on a customer_laptop the asserted_claims are not entitled to the effective_filing_date of the original_application
because the asserted_claims are limited to the filing_date of the cip_application june_15,_2000 they are anticipated by the mobilestar_network

conclusion
the district_court correctly held that there is no genuine_issue of material_fact regarding the asserted_claims being anticipated
we therefore affirm the district_courts summary_judgment of invalidity of claims 15 18 31 35 38 40 and 49 of the ¡¬658 and ¡¬400_patent s

affirmed

the relevant features of the t-mobile_hotspot_network are undisputed
unlike a stand-alone vending machine that vends telecommunications_access the t-mobile_hotspot_network consists of several main components that are geographically distributed throughout the united states
these components work together to enable users to access internet services
multiple users can simultaneously access the t-mobile_hotspot_network

t-mobile does not dispute that the ¡¬658 and ¡¬400_patent s are at least entitled to the effective_filing_date of the 2000 cip_application june_15,_2000

a` cip' application is a continuation-in-part_application containing a portion or all of the disclosure of an earlier_application together with added matter not present in that earlier_application
transco prods. inc. v. performance contracting inc. 38_f.3d_551 555 fed.cir.1994 citing m.p.e.p.¡± 201.08
while the pto has noted that the expressions` continuation'` divisional' and` continuation-in-part' are merely terms used for administrative convenience id. the quintessential difference between a continuation and a continuation-in-part is the addition of new_matter
generally a cip adds new_matter on which at least one claim relies for support
4
determining the effective_filing_date each claim in a cip_application is entitled to can be quite complex
since cips generally add new_matter the claims may be fully supported by the parent_application or they may rely on the new_matter for support

l.j
1947 2012_n._24_(2005) noting` [ u ] nder the new_matter doctrine revisions to the written description that occur after an application is filed may jeopardize the priority_date derived from that application'
in fact a cip could contain different claims entitled to receive different_effective_filing_dates in the same patent
there would be no reason for the pto to undertake what could be a very time consuming written description analysis simply to pronounce the effective_filing_date of each claim absent some dispute over it during prosecution

other new_matter not relevant to the customer_interface was also added
