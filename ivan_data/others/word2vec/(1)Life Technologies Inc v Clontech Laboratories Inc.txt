synopsis
patentee brought action against competitor alleging infringement of patents for engineered reverse transcriptase rt enzyme
following bench_trial the united_states_district_court for the district of maryland alexander williams jr. j. held that patents were unenforceable on ground of inequitable_conduct and patentee appealed
the court of appeals gajarsa circuit_judge held that 1 manner in which inventors used prior_art_article that was disclosed during patent_application process and motivations that inventors derived from article were not` material' to application ; 2 inventors assertion that they had no reasonable_expectation of success as to their following of prior_art_article was not affirmative representation that would support finding of inequitable_conduct ; and 3 inventors failure to disclose information regarding work of rival_researcher did not amount to inequitable_conduct

opinion
gajarsa circuit_judge
life_technologies inc.` lti' appeals the judgment of the united_states_district_court for the district of maryland entered after a bench_trial in which the court held that ltis u.s
patents nos._5244,797` the797_patent` and 5,668,005` the005_patent` were unenforceable on the ground of inequitable_conduct
because the court premised this determination on clearly erroneous_findings of fact we reverse and remand

background
reverse transcriptase` rt' is a naturally occurring enzyme that exhibits dna_polymerase_activity
dna_polymerase_activity enables the rt_enzyme to utilize a messenger rna` mrna' molecule as a template to synthesize a complementary strand of dna` cdna'
this reaction results in a dna/rna hybrid molecule
in addition to dna_polymerase_activity naturally occurring rt known as` wild-type' rt also exhibits rnase_h_activity
rnase_h_activity degrades the original mrna template as the cdna molecule is made
rnase_h_activity is undesirable because this degradation of the mrna template negatively affects the ability and efficiency of the rt to make cdna

beginning in the early 1980s the inventors of the797 and005_patent s drs
michael kotewicz and gary gerard sought to develop a genetically engineered rt_enzyme that exhibited dna_polymerase_activity but did not substantially exhibit rnase_h_activity
kotewicz and gerard faced several difficulties in developing this enzyme
first it was unknown at the time where on the rt_molecule the dna polymerase and rnase_h activities resided
further it was unknown whether the rnase_h_activity could be selectively removed to produce an improved mutant_rt_enzyme that retained dna_polymerase_activity
the inventors spent several years unsuccessfully attempting to locate and delete the rnase_h_activity from the rt_molecule

the breakthrough for the inventors came in 1986 with the publication of m.s
johnson et al. computer analysis of retroviral pol genes assignment of enzymatic functions to specific sequences and homologies with nonviral enzymes 83 proceedings of the nat l
acad
of sci
7648 1986` the johnson_article'
the johnson_article reported comparisons made between amino sequences of certain rt_molecules and the sequence of the ribonuclease enzyme from e. coli which exhibits rnase_h_activity but not dna_polymerase_activity
the findings of johnson suggested to the inventors that the rnase_h_activity of the rt_enzyme resided at the carboxyl_terminal_end of the molecule
the inventors however were skeptical of johnsons results because the literature existing at the time suggested that the location of the rnase_h_activity was at the front end of the rt_molecule
additionally the johnson_article was suspect because it utilized computer comparisons of amino acid sequences rather than experimental data
such computer comparisons were fairly new in the art at the time
thus in order to` exclude the possibility' that johnson was correct kotewicz and gerard decided to conduct experiments at the carboxyl_terminal_end of the rt_enzyme
contrary to expectations these experiments were successful and by december 1986 the inventors had created a mutant_rt_enzyme that lacked rnase_h_activity but retained dna_polymerase_activity

a few months after confirming their discovery kotewicz and gerard learned that another researcher dr. stephen goff was working to develop an engineered rt_enzyme
*1323 on april_15,_1987 kotewicz spoke on the telephone with goff a researcher at columbia university
during this conversation goff stated that he had developed` oligonucleotide_insertion_mutations that reduce rnase_h in cloned [ rt ]'
however there is no indication in the record that goff revealed any further details concerning his work to kotewicz during this conversation
additionally during the summer of 1987 gerard learned that goff had presented his rt research at stanford university
although neither gerard nor kotewicz attended this presentation they surmised based on conversations with colleagues that goff demonstrated` similar_results' as the inventors
based on this information kotewicz and gerard urged lti to allow them to publish their results as quickly as possible under the assumption that goff would soon publish similar work
they also submitted forms to management at lti that initiated the process for preparing a patent_application for their engineered rt_enzyme

in january 1988 kotewicz and gerard filed the parent application from which the797 and005_patent s ultimately issued
in general the application claimed an engineered rt_enzyme that exhibited dna_polymerase_activity but did not exhibit substantial rnase_h_activity
as part of the duty of disclosure under 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 the inventors disclosed to the patent and trademark office` pto' numerous prior_art_references including the johnson_article
however the inventors did not reveal their knowledge of goffs work because their patent attorney indicated that such limited and incomplete information would not be material

during the prosecution leading to the797_patent the johnson_article took on particular importance for the examiner
several times the examiner rejected the inventors claims as obvious over johnson often in combination with other prior_art that described the rt gene sequence
according to the examiner because johnson taught that the rnase_h_activity was located at the carboxyl_terminal_end and because there was a strong motivation in the art to eliminate such activity the claimed invention would have been obvious
in response to these rejections the inventors argued that at the time of the invention there would have been no reasonable_expectation that the application of johnsons results would successfully lead to the deletion of rnase_h_activity
this was because the teachings of johnson were contrary to teachings in the prior_art which suggested that` something more was necessary' than a deletion at the carboxyl_terminal_end to eliminate rnase_h_activity
thus the inventors contended that the claimed invention would not have been obvious over johnson
the examiner was persuaded by these arguments and the797_patent issued on september 19 1993
at no time during this prosecution did the inventors reveal to the examiner that the johnson_article played a key role in their development of the claimed invention

shortly after the issuance of the797_patent the inventors filed the continuation application that eventually resulted in the issuance of the005_patent
during the prosecution of this application the inventors revealed their knowledge of goffs work
the examiner allowed the application to issue over the newly revealed information regarding goff stating that the new information had` no bearing on.. the instant_application'

in december 1996 lti sued clontech_laboratories inc.` clontech' for infringement of the797 and005_patent s. in response clontech asserted various affirmative defenses including an allegation that the patents should be held unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct
a bench_trial on the inequitable_conduct issue ensued
after the trial the court found that the inventors withheld material_information regarding the motivations that they derived from the johnson_article and their reliance on it in reaching their invention
the court also found that the inventors made affirmative material misrepresentations during prosecution regarding the *1324 johnson_article
further the court found that the inventors knowledge of goffs work was material and should have been revealed to the pto during the prosecution of the797_patent
finally the court determined that these actions were done with the intent to deceive the pto
as a result the court held that both the797 and005_patent were unenforceable on the ground of inequitable_conduct
this appeal followed

discussion
applicants for patents including their legal representatives have the duty to prosecute patent_applications in the pto with candor good faith and honesty
see molins plc v. textron inc. 48_f.3d_1172 1178 33_u.s.p.q.2d_1823 1826 fed.cir.1995 ; 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 1999
when this duty is breached the applicant has committed inequitable_conduct
a determination of inequitable_conduct during the prosecution of a patent_application renders the subsequently issued patent unenforceable
see labounty mfg. inc. v. united_states_int l_trade_comm n 958_f.2d_1066 1070 22_u.s.p.q.2d_1025 1028 fed.cir.1992

inequitable conduct can consist of affirmative_misrepresentations of material fact submission of false material_information or the failure to disclose known material_information during the prosecution of a patent coupled with the intent to deceive the pto
see molins 48 f.3d at 1178 33 u.s.p.q.2d at 1826
materiality and intent to deceive are distinct factual inquiries and each must be shown by clear and convincing evidence
see elk corp. v. gaf bldg materials corp. 168_f.3d_28 30 49_u.s.p.q.2d_1853 1855 fed.cir.1999 ; molins 48 f.3d at 1178 33 u.s.p.q.2d at 1826` materiality does not presume intent which is a separate and essential component of inequitable_conduct'
( quoting allen organ co. v. kimball int l inc. 839_f.2d_1556 1567 5_u.s.p.q.2d_1769 1778 fed.cir.1988
once these threshold levels of materiality and intent are satisfied the ultimate determination of inequitable_conduct is within the discretion of the trial court which must make the equitable judgment concerning whether the applicants conduct is so culpable that the patent should not be enforced
see kingsdown med consultants ltd. v. hollister inc. 863_f.2d_867 876 9_u.s.p.q.2d_1384 1392 fed.cir.1988 en banc ; labounty 958 f.2d at 1070 22 u.s.p.q.2d at 1028
in making this determination the court must conduct a balancing test between the levels of materiality and intent with a greater showing of one factor allowing a lesser showing of the other
see critikon inc. v. becton dickinson vascular access inc. 120_f.3d_1253 1256 43_u.s.p.q.2d_1666 1668 fed.cir.1997

because the determination of inequitable_conduct is ultimately committed to the discretion of the district_court we review its determination for abuse of discretion
see kingsdown 863 f.2d at 876 9 u.s.p.q.2d at 1392
we must reverse a discretionary ruling of the district_court when it is premised upon clearly erroneous_findings of fact or on a misapplication or misinterpretation of applicable law or evidences a serious error of judgment
see id
thus the district_courts factual findings on the issues of materiality and intent are reviewed for clear_error and will not be reversed unless this court has a` definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed'
elk corp. 168 f.3d at 31 49 u.s.p.q.2d at 1855 quoting molins 48 f.3d at 1178 33 u.s.p.q.2d at 1827

the district_court determined that the inventors committed inequitable_conduct based on three actions during the prosecution of the797_patent -withholding information regarding their` reliance' on the johnson_article making material misrepresentations regarding the johnson_article and withholding information regarding goffs work
we will address each of these actions in turn

1
withholding information regarding the johnson_article
as described above the johnson_article was extremely influential in leading *1325 the inventors to their engineered rt_enzymes
realizing its materiality to the patentability of the claimed invention the inventors revealed the johnson_article to the pto during prosecution and even discussed it in the written description section of the patent_application
the district_court however determined that merely disclosing the reference itself was insufficient to comply with the duty of candor
relying heavily on the testimony of former pto commissioner harry manbeck the court found that the inventors should have also disclosed their` reliance' on johnson and how it motivated them to conduct the experiments that eventually led to the invention
thus the district_court determined that the manner in which the inventors used a disclosed prior_art_reference is material_information and must be revealed to the pto
because this factual finding was premised upon a misapprehension of the legal standards of patentability it is clearly erroneous

information is material when there is a substantial_likelihood that a reasonable_examiner would have considered the information important in deciding whether to allow the application to issue as a patent
see molins 48 f.3d at 1179 33 u.s.p.q.2d at 1827
because patentability is assessed from the perspective of the hypothetical person of ordinary_skill in the art information regarding the subjective motivations of inventors is not material
see standard_oil co. v. american cyanamid co. 774_f.2d_448 454 227_u.s.p.q._293 297 fed.cir.1985 noting that the person of ordinary_skill in the art is an objective legal construct presumed to think along conventional lines without undertaking to innovate whether by systematic research or by extraordinary insights
as stated by this court in standard_oil inventors as a class according to the concepts underlying the constitution and the statutes that have created the patent system possess something-call it what you will-which sets them apart from the workers of ordinary_skill and one should not go about determining obviousness under ¡± 103 by inquiring into what patentees.. would have known or would likely have done faced with the revelations of references
id
furthermore the path that leads an inventor to the invention is expressly made irrelevant to patentability by statute
see 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a` patentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which the invention was made`
thus the inventors reliance on the johnson_article and the motivations that they derived from it have no bearing on the issue of patentability
it does not matter whether the inventors reached their invention after an exhaustive study of the prior_art or developed their rt_enzymes in complete isolation
the only inquiry is whether the teachings of the johnson_article in combination with other relevant prior_art would have rendered the claimed invention obvious to one of ordinary_skill in the art ; this inquiry as a matter of law is independent of the motivations that led the inventors to the claimed invention
therefore the district_court clearly erred by finding that the inventors reliance on johnson was material

2
material misrepresentations regarding the johnson_article
the district_court also found that the inventors made affirmative_misrepresentations regarding the johnson_article
during the prosecution of the797_patent the inventors were faced with rejections based on johnson which taught the location of the rnase_h_activity in combination with other prior_art_references that described the rt_enzyme itself
in response to these rejections the inventors argued that this combination did not render the claimed invention obvious because at the time the invention was made one of ordinary_skill in the art would have thought that` something more was necessary' than a deletion at the carboxyl_terminal_end to eliminate rnase_h_activity
thus they argued there would have been no reasonable_expectation of success in applying johnsons teachings
the court *1326 determined that this was a misrepresentation because the inventors later admitted that the johnson_article correctly taught the location of rnase_h_activity and led them directly to the claimed invention
in effect the court determined that inventors could not truthfully argue lack of reasonable_expectation of success as a basis for non-obviousness when they successfully used the prior_art_reference at issue
the court clearly erred in this determination

it is axiomatic that a claimed invention is not obvious solely because it is composed of elements that are all individually found in the prior_art
see e.g. in re rouffet 149_f.3d_1350 1357 47_u.s.p.q.2d_1453 1457 fed.cir.1998
thus even though the location of the rnase_h_activity is taught in the johnson_article the claimed invention of the797_patent is not per se obvious
for the johnson_article to render the claimed invention obvious there must have been at the time the invention was made a reasonable_expectation of success in applying johnsons teachings
see micro chem. inc. v. great plains chem co. 103_f.3d_1538 1547 41_u.s.p.q.2d_1238 1245 fed.cir.1997 ; in re o'farrell 853_f.2d_894 903 7_u.s.p.q.2d_1673 1681 fed.cir.1988
because the johnson_article was contrary to established teachings and was based on a relatively new technique the inventors argued that a reasonable_expectation of success was lacking
this argument is simply not a misrepresentation

first in making the argument the inventors merely advocated a particular interpretation of the teachings of the johnson_article and the level of skill in the art which the examiner was free to accept or reject
this argument did not contain any factual assertions that could give rise to a finding of misrepresentation
see e.g. akzo n.v. v. united_states_int l_trade_comm n 808_f.2d_1471 1482 1_u.s.p.q.2d_1241 1247 fed.cir.1986 holding that an argument for distinguishing prior_art even though favorable to the applicants position was not a material misrepresentation because the examiner could reach his/her own conclusions regarding the prior_art
furthermore the inventors argument is not contradicted by the fact that they successfully used the johnson_article to achieve the desired result
reasonable expectation of success is assessed from the perspective of the person of ordinary_skill in the art
see micro chem. 103 f.3d at 1547 41 u.s.p.q.2d at 1245
that the inventors were ultimately successful is irrelevant to whether one of ordinary_skill in the art at the time the invention was made would have reasonably expected success
see standard_oil 774 f.2d at 454 227 u.s.p.q.at 297
the courts finding to the contrary represents impermissible use of hindsight-using the inventors success as evidence that the success would have been expected
see in re kotzab 217_f.3d_1365 1369 55_u.s.p.q.2d_1313 1316 fed.cir.2000 noting the importance of casting the mind back to the time of the invention to avoid the` insidious effect of a hindsight syndrome wherein that which only the invention taught is used against its teacher'
in short the inventors non-obviousness arguments were not affirmative_misrepresentations and can not give rise to a determination of inequitable_conduct
thus the district_court committed clear_error

3
withholding knowledge of goffs work
finally the district_court determined that the inventors had withheld material_information regarding goffs work
specifically the court found that the inventors should have revealed that goff claimed to have developed` oligonucleotide_insertion_mutations that reduce [ d ] rnase_h in cloned [ rt ]' and had presented these results at a conference during the summer of 1987
the court clearly erred in finding that this information was material

as described above information is material when there is a substantial_likelihood that a reasonable_examiner would have considered the information important in *1327 deciding whether to allow the application to issue as a patent
see molins 48 f.3d at 1179 33 u.s.p.q.2d at 1827
the inventors were in possession of only very limited information regarding goffs work
at most the inventors could have disclosed to the pto that a rival_researcher claimed to have reduced rnase_h_activity in cloned rt and had presented his results at a conference which neither of the inventors attended
clontech contends that this information was material because it indicated that goff was a prior_inventor
however this information lacks the specificity and definiteness required to support a patentability rejection under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 g

to establish prior_inventorship one must show either a prior reduction to practice of the invention or a prior conception followed by reasonable diligence in reducing the invention to practice
see eaton v. evans 204_f.3d_1094 1097 53_u.s.p.q.2d_1696 1698 fed.cir.2000
while the inventors knew that goff had potentially achieved a reduction in rnase_h_activity in rt_enzymes the inventors were unaware of when these results were achieved how they were achieved the degree to which the rnase_h_activity was reduced or whether dna_polymerase_activity was retained
knowledge of these details would have been required for the examiner to consider whether goff was a prior_inventor
because the inventors lacked such crucial information the incomplete knowledge that they did have regarding goff would not have been material to a reasonable_examiner
see hartness int l inc. v. simplimatic eng g co. 819_f.2d_1100 1107 2_u.s.p.q.2d_1826 1831 fed.cir.1987 holding that inequitable_conduct had not been established when the patentee had only` heard of' a third-party usage
this conclusion is supported by the fact that when the substance of the goff telephone conversation was revealed to the examiner during the prosecution of the005_patent the examiner stated that the information had` no bearing on the patents issued or the instant_application'
such a strong statement regarding the goff information is highly probative of its immateriality
see molins 48 f.3d at 1179 33 u.s.p.q.2d at 1827` [ t ] he result of a pto proceeding that assesses patentability in light of information not originally disclosed can be of strong probative value in determining whether the undisclosed information was material
``

moreover the inventors did not obtain any material_information regarding goffs work based on his presentation at stanford
the inventors neither attended this presentation nor were provided with an abstract of the presentation
they had heard from colleagues that goff presented results similar to theirs but the record does not show that the inventors learned any additional details regarding goffs work
thus the inventors could not have revealed anything to the examiner regarding this presentation beyond conjecture and a vague report that` similar_results' were presented
such incomplete information would be singularly unhelpful to the examiner in determining whether the invention was patentable and consequently would not be material

conclusion
the district_court clearly erred in finding that the inventors withheld material_information and made affirmative_misrepresentations during the prosecution of the patents at issue
therefore the courts determination that the inventors engaged in inequitable_conduct is reversed and this case is remanded for further proceedings
