bissell circuit_judge
this court accepted an interlocutory_appeal of an order dated september 8 1986 83 civ
no._8568-_leisure [ hereinafter september 8 order ] from the district court for the southern_district of new_york
the district_court stated the controlling question of law as whether consistent with the code of professional_responsibility of the american_bar_association or the model rules of professional conduct a patent attorney can work with a corporate_inventor to draft or prosecute a patent_application to issuance of a patent and subsequently despite the objection of both the corporate_inventor and a later assignee of the patent represent interests seeking to invalidate or narrowly construe the self-same patent

no._8568-_leisure s.d.n.y
jan._7,_1987 order granting request for certification of september 8 order [ hereinafter certification_order ]
the motion of medtronic inc. to disqualify william_c._nealon and michael_i._rackman and his law_firm gottlieb rackman & reisman as counsel for telectronics_proprietary ltd. telectronics inc. and telectronics u.s.a. inc. collectively` telectronics' was denied with qualification in the september 8 order
in the context of the facts of this case we affirm the september 8 order

background
this dispute began in august 1983 with an international trade commission itc investigation denominated in re certain cardiac_pacemakers and components thereof inv
no._337- ta-162 [ hereinafter cardiac_pacemakers ]
medtronic sought relief under 19 u.s.c.¡± 1337 supp
iii 1985 for alleged infringement by telectronics of medtronics four patents-united states letters patent nos._3648,707707 4,059,116116 4,312,355355 and 3,595,242242

in november 1983 telectronics filed this declaratory_judgment_action seeking a declaration of patent_invalidity unenforceability and noninfringement with respect to the707116 and355_patent s. medtronic counterclaimed for infringement of these three patents and the242_patent and sought a declaration that the four patents were valid infringed and enforceable
because *1334 medtronic put the242_patent at issue telectronics filed a first amended and supplemental complaint requesting that all four patents be declared invalid and unenforceable and that telectronics be declared not to have infringed the patents

medtronic moved to disqualify counsel
it argued that nealon and rackman had served as in-house and outside counsel respectively for american optical corporation ao the original patent holder and that they had participated in the prosecution of the242_patent for ao
medtronic urged that it was improper for nealon and rackman now attorneys for telectronics to challenge the validity of the242_patent

medtronic claimed the status of` former_client' for itself as assignee of the242_patent
it also claimed this for its employee barouh v. berkovits the inventor of the242_patent who was employed by ao when the patent was prosecuted
on this basis medtronic contended that representation of telectronics by rackman and nealon was contrary to the ethical requirements of canons 4 5 7 and 9 of the code of professional_responsibility of the american_bar_association aba
telectronics opposed the disqualification motion on the grounds of 1 res_judicata because of the denial of a similar motion in a related case before the itc 2 laches and 3 the absence of conflict between representation by rackman and nealon and the aba_code of professional_responsibility

**49 without reaching the issues of res_judicata and laches the district_court in the september 8 order denied medtronics motion to disqualify counsel conditioned on telectronics not raising an issue of fraud or misconduct regarding the prosecution of the242_patent and restricting its proof of obviousness to art discovered after the issuance of the patent
on january 7 1987 the district_court granted medtronics request for certification of the september 8 order and granted it permission to petition this court to accept an appeal of the september 8 order
we accepted the appeal on may_22,_1987

the242_patent
the inventor
berkovits while an employee and director of research and development of ao invented a cardiac pacemaker relating to dual chamber cardiac pacing
on march_4,_1969 berkovits assigned to ao his entire interest in the invention
a patent_application was filed which issued on july_27,_1971 as the242_patent
berkovits on terminating his employment with ao in 1975 assumed his current employment with medtronic

ownership and licensing
medtronic is the current owner of the242_patent ; telectronics is a current_licensee
the history of the ownership licensing and successive assignments of the242_patent although complex is most pertinent to the issue under review

telectronics acquired its license to make use and sell products covered by the242_patent as follows
in 1973 ao granted to n.v. philips gloeilampenfabrieken philips a nonexclusive license under the242_patent for pacer devices
in 1976 the parties amended the agreement such that ao granted philips a paid-up license for external pacer devices but philips would continue royalty payments to ao on the implantable_pacer_devices
in 1981 philips transferred its242_patent license_rights to a joint venture with honeywell inc
subsequent transactions between honeywell inc. and philips resulted in honeywell medical electronics hme acquiring in 1983 all license_rights under the amended 1973 ao-philips_agreement
in 1984 hme assigned these rights to telectronics
contemporaneously telectronics concluded negotiations with warner lambert technologies wlt the successor to ao and thus the licensor of the242_patent under the amended 1973 ao-philips_agreement for a paid-up license on the implantable_pacer_devices
accordingly telectronics became the final and current_licensee under the amended 1973 ao-philips licensing agreement

the history of medtronics acquisition of the242_patent is equally complex
in 1975 the original owner ao sold the *1335242_patent to mt inc. subject to aos continuing right as a licensor to receive royalties under its existing licenses
thereafter two assignments **50 were executed in 1976 ao assigned the242_patent to american pacemaker corporation apc as successor-in-name to mt inc. ; and in 1979 apc assigned that patent to medtronic

itc investigation
on the basis of the above history of licensing and assignments the itc determined that telectronics had acquired a license to make use and sell products covered by the242_patent from parties whose rights were superior to those of medtronic and dismissed medtronics complaint
cardiac_pacemakers order_no._52 may_25,_1984
in addition the itc denied medtronics motion to disqualify rackman and his firm without opinion
cardiac_pacemakers order_no._44 apr._27,_1984
after medtronic filed a notice of appeal of order_no._52 and order_no._44 in this court medtronic moved for a voluntary dismissal of the appeal which this court granted with prejudice

the attorneys
rackman has been telectronics primary outside patent counsel for about seven years
however it is undisputed that an attorney-client_relationship existed between rackman and ao
rackman while an associate of the law_firm of amster and rothstein had served as outside patent counsel for ao in the 1960s
he prepared several draft applications for ao some involving pacemaker technology others involving non-pacemaker technology
rackman had occasion to meet with ao in connection with these draft applications and on these visits he met with berkovits
rackman avers that he has no recollection of working on a draft of the242_patent_application but does not deny it because the242_patent_application drawings are in a style that he used
however his name is not of record in the file_history of the242_patent
he avers that he has had no access to files concerning the242 matter for over fifteen years since his departure from amster & rothstein and that amster & rothstein no longer has a242 file
hence his only knowledge of the prosecution of the242_patent is what is present in the public record

nealon has been in-house_patent_counsel for telectronics since 1977
his attorney-client_relationship with ao is also undisputed because he was aos in-house_patent_counsel during the period at issue
on march_4,_1969 berkovits as inventor appointed nealon and two other attorneys` my attorneys with full power of substitution and revocation to prosecute [ the242_patent ] application and to make alterations and amendments therein'
all correspondence with the united states patent and trademark office was sent to nealon as principal attorney
according to the file_history in the pto nealon communicated with the pto at least four times during the prosecution of the patent_application

**51 opinion
i
jurisdiction
we accept jurisdiction over the september 8 order denying disqualification under 28 u.s.c.¡± 1292 c 1 supp
iii 1985
the district_court certified that the order involved a controlling question of law and that certification would materially advance the interests of the litigants and the interests of judicial economy
sun_studs inc. v. applied theory assocs. inc. 772_f.2d_1557 1566 227_uspq_81 87 fed.cir.1985

ii
choice of law
we follow second_circuit precedent in deciding this procedural question
sun_studs 772 f.2d at 1566 227 uspq at 87 ; panduit corp. v. all states plastic mfg co. 744_f.2d_1564 1572-76 223_uspq_465 469-72 fed.cir.1984
that court has stated that` a motion to disqualify an attorney is addressed to the discretion of the district_court and a ruling thereon will not be overturned absent a determination of abuse of discretion'
cheng v. gaf corp. 631_f.2d_1052 1055 2d cir.1980 vacated on other_grounds 450_u.s._903 101_s.ct._1338 67_l.ed.2d_327_(1981) citing hull v. celanese corp. 513_f.2d_568 571 2d cir.1975
the question thus raised in this *1336 appeal is whether the district_courts refusal to disqualify nealon and rackman and his firm was such an abuse

iii
discussion
the second_circuit has recognized the aba_code of professional_responsibility as providing appropriate guidance in disqualification proceedings
cheng 631 f.2d at 1055
however that circuit has adopted a` restrained approach' to attorney disqualification by focusing` primarily on preserving the integrity of the trial process'
armstrong v. mcalpin 625_f.2d_433 444 2d cir.1980 en banc vacated and remanded on other_grounds 449_u.s._1106 101_s.ct._911 66_l.ed.2d_835_(1981) citing board of educ
of new_york v. nyquist 590_f.2d_1241 1246 2d cir.1979
thus with rare exceptions disqualification has been ordered only in essentially two kinds of cases 1 where an attorneys conflict of interests in violation of canons 5_and_9 of the code of professional_responsibility undermines the courts confidence in the vigor of the attorneys representation of his client.. or more commonly 2 where the attorney is at least potentially in a position to use privileged information concerning the other side through prior_representation for example in violation of canons 4_and_9 thus giving his present client an unfair_advantage.... **52 weighing the needs of efficient judicial administration against the potential advantage of immediate preventive measures we believe that unless an attorneys conduct tends to` taint the underlying_trial' by disturbing the balance of the presentations in one of the two ways indicated above courts should be quite hesitant to disqualify an attorney
board of educ
v. nyquist 590 f.2d at 1246 footnotes and citations omitted

disqualification under canon 4
canon 4 of the aba_code of professional_responsibility provides that` [ a ] lawyer should preserve the confidences and secrets of a client'
disqualification may be appropriate if 1 the moving party is a former_client of the adverse partys counsel ; 2 there is substantial relationship between the subject matter of the counsels prior_representation of the moving party and the issues in the present lawsuit ; and 3 the attorney whose disqualification is sought had access to or was likely to have access to relevant privileged information in the course of his prior_representation of the client
smi_indus canada ltd. v. caelter indus. inc. 586_f.supp._808 815 223_uspq_742 746 n.d.n.y.1984 citing evans v. artek sys corp. 715_f.2d_788 791 2d cir.1983 ; cheng 631 f.2d at 1055-56 ; code of professional_responsibility canon 4 disciplinary rule dr 4-101 b 1980 ; see also emle indus. inc. v. patentex inc. 478_f.2d_562 570 2d cir.1973
thus if no attorney-client_relationship exists no potential violation of canon 4 can occur
smi_indus. 586 f.supp.at 816 223 uspq at 747

medtronic claimed` former_client' status as the assignee of ao
the district_court correctly found that medtronic was never a client of either rackman or nealon because the assignment of a patent does not transfer an attorney-client_relationship
see smi_indus. 586 f.supp.at 815 223 uspq at 747 assignee of assets does not stand in shoes of its assignor for purposes of canon 4 citing in re yarn processing patent validity litigation 530_f.2d_83 190_uspq_523_(5th_cir.1976) ; beghin-say v. rasmussen 212_uspq_614_(dec.comm'r_pat.1980)

medtronic also contended that the inventor berkovits is entitled to` former_client' status
again the district_court correctly found that no attorney-client_relationship existed
berkovits was not the alter_ego of ao
the patent was not issued to berkovits but to the original patentee ao
berkovits as an employee of the corporation merely assisted aos attorneys in preparing and prosecuting the patent_application including the routine execution *1337 of a power of attorney appointing the attorneys chosen by ao
see sun_studs 772 f.2d at 1568 227 uspq at 89
any confidences imparted to aos attorneys were shielded solely by aos attorney-client privilege which was waived by aos successor wlt
although berkovits **53 stated that rackman had free access to his files and that he considered rackman his lawyer the district_court found that berkovits could not have reasonably expected that any information he conveyed to rackman would have been withheld from ao
in sum we hold there was no abuse of discretion in the district_courts conclusion that canon 4 was not violated because no attorney-client_relationship existed between medtronic or berkovits and rackman or nealon

disqualification under canon 5
medtronic contended that disqualification is required under canon 5
under this canon if it is obvious that a lawyer or one in his firm ought to be called as a witness on behalf of his client he and his firm must withdraw from the conduct of the trial and may not continue representation in the trial
dr 5-102 a

the district_court concluded that canon 5 was inapplicable to nealon because he will not actually participate at trial
the court interpreted the code of professional_responsibility as precluding a dual role for an attorney only when he will testify and is also involved in` the conduct of the trial'
dr 5-102 a

medtronic contends that rackman must be disqualified because he will be a witness on the issue of` new_prior_art'
because the issues of fraud or misconduct in the prosecution of the patent were absent from the case the district_court determined that rackmans necessity as a witness depended on the evidence to be considered in the factual evaluation of obviousness
after careful consideration of the nature of the evidence to be introduced on the issue of obviousness and because the obviousness issue relates solely to newly discovered prior_art and not to whether the patents were properly procured in the first instance the district_court found that rackman was not an attorney who` ought to be called as a witness in the proceeding..
the phraseought to be called as a witness has been narrowly construed to refer to an attorneywho has crucial information in his possession which must be divulged in the course of a trial'
smi_indus. 586 f.supp.at 817 223 uspq at 748 emphasis in original citations omitted

the district_court also concluded that rackmans testimony was not required on the infringement_issue because the file wrapper contains all pertinent information required to determine the scope of the claim
based upon the above discussion we hold that the district_court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that disqualification of nealon and rackman would be inappropriate under canon 5

disqualification under canon 7
medtronic claims telectronics pleadings demonstrate professional` taint' because nealon and rackman omitted claims and defenses that if included would have required their withdrawal for **54 ethical considerations
specifically medtronic asserts that telectronics 1 omitted the242_patent from the declaratory_judgment_action ; 2 waived possible legitimate affirmative defenses under 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 1982 ; 3 failed to assert that` new_prior_art' should have been disclosed to the patent office thus making rackman and nealon parties to a fraud ; and 4 used ambiguous pleadings by alleging that the242_patent is invalid because the invention was anticipated and obvious when made

the district_court found that the omission of the242_patent from the original complaint could not be viewed as unreasonable in light of telectronics successful license defense to the242_patent in the itc proceeding
as to medtronics remaining arguments concerning the decision of telectronics lawyers to prove invalidity of the242_patent by showing only obviousness based on newly discovered prior_art the district_court found that these tactics did not indicate that telectronics attorneys were unreasonable or ineffective
`` in his *1338 representation of a client a lawyer may.. [ w ] here permissible exercise his professional judgment to waive or fail to assert a right or position of his client'
dr 7-101 b

accordingly the district_court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that rackman and nealon are entitled to structure the case according to their own professional judgment by selecting the defenses to be made against the242_patent
nor did it abuse its discretion in finding no showing that rackman and nealon were not vigorous in the representation of their client

disqualification under canon 9
this canon presents to us and presented to the district_court the most difficulty
in its certification_order the district_court stated whether` former_client' status may be accorded to berkovits is uncertain
however to permit the same attorneys who had unrestricted access to the inventor his records his knowledge and strategy and who undertook the extensive collaboration needed to draft and prosecute his patent_application to lead the attack to undermine those efforts and invalidate the resulting patent may taint the underlying_trial and damage the integrity of the judicial process
certification_order at 15

the bottom line however is that attorneys represent clients-not legal positions or patents
having failed to establish the existence of any attorney-client_relationship with itself or berkovits medtronic asks this court to apply the vague standard of an` appearance of impropriety' in the guise of a rule` unique to the practice of patent law' and to disqualify counsel where there is no actual impropriety exhibited
we will not do this
instead we will apply the law of the second_circuit which like our case law recognizes the trend away from disqualification based solely on an appearance of impropriety
**55 new_york_inst
of technology v. biosound inc. 658_f.supp._759 762 2_uspq2d_2039 2041 s.d.n.y.1987 citing armstrong 625 f.2d at 446 ; accord ah ju steel co. v. armco inc. 680_f.2d_751 754 ccpa 1982

telectronics does concede that it would be unusual to have counsel impeaching their own work product
but that is not this case
rackman and nealons continued representation is subject to the condition that the proof of invalidity of the242_patent will be limited to prior_art that was not known at the time that the application was prosecuted
no change in any position taken during the prosecution of the242_patent patent is required to recognize the significance of that art
similarly no change in position is required on the infringement_issue because telectronics allegedly infringing products were not first produced until some time after the issuance of the242_patent
although counsel for telectronics may have to testify when a particular piece of prior_art became known to them patent owners and attorneys are often asked that question during discovery and no disqualification is required

the district_court stated in the certification_order that [ t ] he substantial ground for difference of opinion regarding the september 8 order is perhaps best illustrated by two conflicting district_court decisions [ hooper v. steelplank corp. 215_uspq_829_(e.d.mich.1981) and smi_indus ]
hooper generally supports medtronics position while smi generally supports telectronics position
notably in sun_studs the federal_circuit adopted and cited with approval the reasoning articulated in hooper with respect to attorney disqualification in patent-based disputes
certification_order at 12

although this court in sun_studs cited with approval the reasoning in hooper two important factual differences distinguish this case from hooper
there the district_court found that 1 the individual was the alter_ego of the corporation and thus an attorney-client_relationship existed ; and 2 although a client may waive his right to object to his attorneys representation of adverse_interests the facts did not support a waiver
hooper 215 uspq at 831
*1339 here the district_court found that 1 berkovits was not the alter-ego of ao and thus an attorney-client_relationship did not exist ; and 2 wlt the successor in interest to ao had provided a written waiver to rackman and nealons representation

under the law of the second_circuit these distinctions are crucial
in the second_circuit for purposes of canon 9 the appearance of impropriety by itself is usually not a sufficient basis for disqualification
see board of educ
v. nyquist 590 f.2d at 1247 ; new_york_inst
of technology 658 f.supp.at 761 2 uspq2d at 2041
only in unusual situations will the appearance of impropriety alone be sufficient to warrant disqualification
id
**56 we do not agree that the alleged appearance of impropriety in this case presents the` unusual' situation in which disqualification on canon 9 grounds alone is warranted..
this is not a case in which an attorney has represented one client and then switched over to his former_clients adversary..
in addition any appearance of impropriety is lessened by the fact that [ rackman and nealon ] did not undertake successive representation of clients with adverse_interests
new_york_inst
of technology 658 f.supp.at 762-63 2 uspq2d at 2041-42
medtronic furthermore made no showing that rackman or nealon obtained actual_confidences that would give telectronics an unfair_advantage
although medtronic asserts that during berkovits relationship with rackman and nealon important decisions were made encompassing the scope and content of the prior_art the arguments to be made in support of non-obviousness and the sufficiency of the disclosure no specifics of the unfair_advantage were set forth before the district_court
medtronic submits however that it has no burden to show the existence of specific confidences because the court must assume that during the prior_representation confidences were disclosed
this assumption might well be valid if there had been a previously existing attorney-client_relationship
see t.c
theatre corp. v. warner bros. pictures inc. 113_f.supp._265 268-69 s.d.n.y.1953
here the district_court found no such relationship existed and therefore the assumption is not applicable
accordingly the district_court did not abuse its discretion

conclusion
the district_courts extraordinarily careful findings and conclusions are entirely consistent with the second_circuits restrained approach towards disqualification see united states football league v. national football league 605_f.supp._1448 1452 s.d.n.y.1985
thus the district_court did not abuse its discretion in denying medtronics motion to disqualify nealon and rackman and his firm subject to the conditions that telectronics would not raise an issue of fraud or misconduct regarding the prosecution of the242_patent and would restrict its proof of obviousness to art discovered subsequent to the issuance of the patent
