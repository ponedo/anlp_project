avid identification systems inc.` avid' brought suit against datamars_sa and its subsidiary crystal import corporation collectively` datamars' alleging infringement of avids u.s._patent_no._5235,326` the ¡¬326_patent` directed to a multi-mode radio-frequency_identification_system for reading encoded biocompatible_chips
the patent was found valid and infringed but held to be unenforceable for inequitable_conduct
this appeal challenges the district_courts finding of inequitable_conduct
in reviewing the district_courts finding we address which individuals are` substantively involved' in the preparation or prosecution of a patent_application and thus owe a duty of candor and good_faith to the patent and trademark_office under 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56
we affirm the finding of the district_court

background
avid is a small closely held company that designs and markets biocompatible radio frequency identification chips for implantation in animals
avid markets its chips to pet owners as a way of increasing the chances that an estranged companion animal will be identified and reunited with its family
avid markets devices for reading its chips to animal hospitals and shelters

avids founder and president veterinarian dr. hannis stoddard testified that he decided to form the avid corporation after visiting an animal shelter to reclaim his own lost dog
he explained that most animals at the shelter were clearly lost pets but there was no way to find their homes
dr._stoddard made it his mission *970 to implement a better system of dealing with the identification and processing of recovered animals
he and a colleague peter troesch formed avid for the purpose of carrying out dr._stoddards mission

when the company first started avid purchased unencrypted identification chips from a supplier relabeled them and sold them as a marketer and distributor
the company discontinued its resale business model in around 1985 because dr._stoddard wanted avid to develop its own technology
specifically stoddard wanted avid to develop a chip and reader_system where the reader could read both the unencrypted_chips currently on the market as well as encrypted chips that avid produced
stoddard hired at least three engineers dr. polish dr._malm and mr. beigel to carry out this objective
by about 1990 these engineers developed an encrypted identification chip that could be read by a reader programmed with avids decryption code
they also developed a` multi-mode' reader that could read both avids encrypted chip and traditional unencrypted_chips

dr._stoddard demonstrated some of avids technology at a u.s. livestock committee trade show in around april of 1990
in august of 1991 avid filed for the ¡¬326_patent on a multi-mode encrypted chip and reader_system where the reader can read both unencrypted_chips and avids encrypted chips
the inventors named on the application were polish malm and beigel
dr._malm was also listed as the prosecuting attorney
a few days before the patent_application was filed the inventors assigned their rights to avid
dr._stoddard signed the small_entity_status_affidavit filed with the patent
avid was also pursuing european patent rights for its encrypted chip and reader_system during this time
the ¡¬326_patent issued in august of 1993

datamars is a competitor of avid in the companion animal identification chip market
avid brought suit against datamars and several other competitors in 2004 alleging infringement of its ¡¬326_patent as well as unfair_competition and false_advertising_claims
the other defendants settled their claims with avid
the case against datamars proceeded to trial and a verdict

the jury found the ¡¬326_patent willfully infringed and not invalid and found in favor of avid on the unfair_competition and false_advertising_claims
the jury awarded avid $ 26,981 on the patent infringement claim and $ 6 million on the unfair_competition claim
following the trial datamars filed a motion to hold the patent unenforceable for inequitable_conduct
the district_court granted the motion without trial finding that dr._stoddards trade_show_demonstration was material_prior_art under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b and that information regarding the demonstration was withheld from the u.s. patent and trademark_office` pto' with deceptive_intent
specifically the district_court found that dr._stoddard owed a duty of candor to the pto

after this ruling on inequitable_conduct the parties entered into a settlement_agreement
pursuant to the terms of the agreement the parties stipulated to a dismissal of all claims other than those related to the ¡¬326_patent the payment for unfair_competition was reduced to $ 3 million avid filed an unopposed_motion for reconsideration of the district_courts inequitable_conduct_decision and datamars agreed not to contest the standing jurisdiction mootness or case and controversy of the inequitable_conduct_decision on appeal to this court
in the event that avid prevailed on reversing the inequitable_conduct *971 determination on motion for reconsideration or on appeal to this court datamars agreed to pay the $ 26,981 previously awarded by the jury for infringement of the ¡¬326_patent

the district_court dismissed the unopposed_motion for reconsideration of the inequitable_conduct_decision finding that there was no case or controversy between the parties
the district_court explained that the terms of the settlement_agreement explicitly precluded datamars from opposing the motion for reconsideration in any way thus eliminating any adversity between the parties on all matters before the district_court
the district_court noted in its opinion that avid argued for the first time on reconsideration that dr._stoddard did not have a duty of candor before the pto

avid timely appealed the district_courts determination of inequitable_conduct to this court
datamars did not file a brief in response

discussion
there are two issues before this court on appeal first whether the court has jurisdiction to decide the issue of inequitable_conduct and second if we do have jurisdiction whether the district_court abused its discretion in holding the ¡¬326_patent unenforceable for inequitable_conduct
we discuss each in turn

i
case and controversy
as a preliminary matter we must determine whether the issue of inequitable_conduct is properly before this court
the mere fact that datamars agreed with avid not to dispute standing jurisdiction mootness and case or controversy in this appeal does not thereby give avid standing or this court jurisdiction
similarly it does not create a case or controversy where one would not otherwise exist
this court must always determine for itself whether it has jurisdiction to hear the case before it even when the parties do not raise or contest the issue
special devices inc. v. oea inc. 269_f.3d_1340 1342 fed.cir.2001 ; view eng g inc. v. robotic vision sys. inc. 115_f.3d_962 963 fed.cir.1997

amicus allflex argues that avids appeal is mooted by the settlement_agreement between avid and datamars
allflex argues that the provision of the settlement carving out the ¡¬326_patent and making the $ 26,981 payment contingent on the outcome of this appeal is not enough to preserve a controversy between the parties
allflex argues that datamars has no further interest in the disposition of this case and that the $ 26,981` side bet' is a nominal gesture in light of the $ 3 million in consideration to datamars for agreeing not to oppose reconsideration below or the procedural_appropriateness of the appeal

for the reasons stated in the district_courts opinion dismissing avids motion for reconsideration we agree with the district_court that the terms of avids settlement_agreement with datamars eliminated any case or controversy before the district_court regarding the motion for reconsideration
the settlement_agreements limitations on datamarss ability to oppose avids efforts on appeal however are different from the agreements limitations on datamarss ability oppose avids motion for reconsideration
as a result of these differences there is still a live_controversy between the parties on appeal

a live_controversy still exists because datamars remained free under the settlement_agreement to oppose this appeal on the merits
see e.g. kimberly-clark corp. v. procter & gamble distributing co. 973_f.2d_911 913-14 fed.cir.1992
that it chose not to submit a brief does not *972 deprive this court of jurisdiction over the issues on appeal
similarly datamarss agreement not to contest the procedural_appropriateness of the appeal does not release this court from its legal obligation to determine procedural_appropriateness sua sponte
see johannsen v. pay less drug stores n.w. inc. 918_f.2d_160 161 fed.cir.1990
both the merits and procedure are therefore issues before the court on appeal

although the $ 26,981 riding on the outcome of the appeal may be dwarfed by the other monetary provisions of the settlement_agreement this amount is not a token or arbitrary sum introduced for the purpose of manufacturing a controversy
it represents the entirety of the jury award for patent infringement which datamars would have been legally obligated to pay to avid if the ¡¬326_patent were not held unenforceable

for these reasons we conclude that there remains a live_controversy between the parties on the issue of unenforceability of the ¡¬326_patent and that this court has jurisdiction to decide the case under 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1
we now turn to the merits of the issues presented

ii
inequitable conduct
a party may show inequitable_conduct by producing clear and convincing evidence of 1 material_prior_art 2 knowledge chargeable to the patent applicant of prior_art and its materiality and 3 the applicants failure to disclose the prior_art to the pto with intent to mislead
fmc_corp. v. manitowoc co. 835_f.2d_1411 1415 fed.cir.1987
information is material if there is a` substantial likelihood that a reasonable_examiner would consider it important in deciding whether to allow the application to issue as a patent'
j.p. stevens & co. v. lex tex ltd. 747_f.2d_1553 1559 fed.cir.1984

this court reviews the ultimate determination of inequitable_conduct under an abuse of discretion_standard
kingsdown_med consultants_ltd. v. hollister_inc. 863_f.2d_867 876 fed.cir.1988 en banc in relevant part
the underlying findings on materiality and intent are reviewed for clear_error and will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of a` definite and firm conviction' that a mistake has been made
id.at 872

in the present appeal avid challenges the district_courts finding that the trade_show_demonstration was material and that dr._stoddard had a duty of candor to disclose this information
avid does not dispute on appeal that dr._stoddard withheld the information with specific intent to deceive the pto for the purposes of obtaining a patent
we thus turn to the issues of materiality and duty of candor

a. materiality
in evaluating materiality this court typically refers to the definition provided in 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 by which the pto promulgated the duty of disclosure
see astrazeneca pharm
lp v. teva pharm
usa 583_f.3d_766 773 fed.cir.2009
information is material where a reasonable_examiner would find it important to a determination of patentability
id

on appeal avid argues that the district_courts finding of materiality was clearly erroneous because dr._stoddards trade_show_demonstration related to a precursor_product that did not contain all of the elements of the ¡¬326_patent claims
avids arguments against materiality focus on the fact that a jury was presented with the trade show information and still found the patent not invalid
avid concludes that the jury must have found that the trade_show_demonstrations were not ¡± 102 b prior_art
such arguments however *973 confuse the concepts of` material' and` invalidating'
we have often held that a reasonable_examiner may find a particular_piece of information important to a determination of patentability even if that piece of information does not actually invalidate the patent
see praxair inc. v. atmi inc. 543_f.3d_1306 1314-15 fed.cir.2008 holding that similar prior_art that did not meet all of the patents claim limitations was nonetheless material ; upjohn co. v. mova pharm corp. 225_f.3d_1306 1312 fed.cir.2000 ; molins plc v. textron inc. 48_f.3d_1172 1179-80 fed.cir.1995

the district_court found that sales_demonstrations would be important to a determination of patentability under ¡± 102 b
see 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b` the invention was patented or described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country or in public_use or on sale in this country more than one year prior to the date of the application for patent in the united states'
the district_court found that the precursor_product while not invalidating reflected the closest_prior_art and thus was highly material to patentability
we hold that the district_courts analysis of materiality is not clearly erroneous

b
duty of candor
pto rule 56 codified at 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 imposes on all individuals associated with the filing and prosecution of a patent_application a duty of candor and good_faith in dealing with the pto during the period of examination of a patent_application
37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 a
the duty of candor includes a duty to disclose to the pto all information known to each individual that is material to the issue of patentability
id
this information includes prior sale or public_use of the invention one year or more before the filing date of the application
see 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 b
thus to have a duty to disclose information to the pto an individual must 1 be associated with the filing and prosecution of a patent_application such that he owes a duty of candor to the pto and 2 know that the information is question is material
id.¡± 1.56 a

for purposes of identifying who owes a duty of candor to the pto rule 56 defines` individual [ s ] associated with the filing or prosecution of a patent_application' as 1 each named inventor 2 each attorney or agent that prepares or prosecutes the application and 3 every other_person who is substantively involved in the preparation or prosecution of the application and who is associated with the inventor or assignee
37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 c
individuals other than the attorney agent or inventor who are` substantively involved in the preparation or prosecution of the application' may comply with their duty of candor by disclosing known material_information to one of the attorney agent or inventor
37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 d

if an individual who is substantively involved in the preparation or prosecution of an application fails to comply with his duty of candor then that individuals misconduct is chargeable to the applicant for the patent and the applicants patent is held unenforceable
molins 48 f.3d at 1178 ; fmc_corp. 835 f.2d at 1415_n._8
in this case it is undisputed that dr._stoddard is not an inventor of the ¡¬326_patent or an attorney or agent who prepared the ¡¬326_patent_application
thus whether dr._stoddard owed a duty of candor to the pto such that his misconduct would be chargeable to avid the applicant for the ¡¬326_patent depends on whether he was an individual who was` substantively involved in the preparation or prosecution of the application' and` associated with the inventor or assignee'
37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 c 3

*974 what constitutes` substantive [ ] involve [ ment ] in the preparation or prosecution of the application' the issue on which this case turns has not previously been addressed by this court
we read` substantively involved' to mean that the involvement relates to the content of the application or decisions related thereto and that the involvement is not wholly administrative or secretarial in nature
see manual of patent_examining_procedures_¡± 2001.01 8th_ed. rev.2 may 2004

in this case the district_court made the following findings of fact with respect to inequitable_conduct 1 that avid was aware of the consequences of selling or offering to sell its reader and tag before filing the ¡¬326_patent_application 2 that avid attempted to file the ¡¬326_patent_application in advance of the 102 b date i.e
within one year after its first sales but failed and 3 that avid intentionally withheld evidence of such sales from the pto in an effort to deceive the pto and secure allowance of the ¡¬326_patent1

inequitable_conduct_order at 7
based on these findings the court concluded that avid acted with deceptive_intent during prosecution of the ¡¬326_patent
id.at 8

in support of its inequitable_conduct finding the district_court also made several findings related specifically to dr._stoddard
id
based on these findings the district_court concluded that dr._stoddard was` substantively involved' within the meaning of 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 c 3 such that he owed a duty of candor to the pto

the district_courts fact findings related to dr._stoddard include the nature of his position as president and founder of avid that avid is a closely held company and that stoddard hired the inventors to reduce his encrypted chip concept to practice
id
these facts establish that dr._stoddard was associated with the inventors of the ¡¬326_patent and with the assignee avid in accordance with the latter requirement of ¡± 1.56 c 3

with respect to the first requirement of ¡± 1.56 c 3 requiring that the individual be substantively involved in the preparation or prosecution of the application the district_court found that dr._stoddard was` involved in all aspects of the companys operation from marketing and sales to research and development'
inequitable_conduct_order at 8
dr._stoddards involvement in` all aspects' of avid including its research and development contributes to a reasonable inference that he was also involved in the preparation of the patent_application relating to that research
that this fact would contribute to such an inference is especially reasonable here since the ¡¬326_patent was directed to the system that fulfilled dr._stoddards personal mission and the purpose for which his company was created

the district_court also cited two communications related to dr._stoddards substantive_involvement in patent_matters
see def
trial_ex
# 27 and def
trial_ex
*975 # 251
one communication was from an inventor named in the ¡¬ 326 patent and contained content for a european_patent_application
dr._stoddard was one of two recipients of this communication the other being the european prosecuting attorney
the european_patent_application was the international phase of the ¡¬326_patent_application
the other communication was a note from the same inventor to dr._stoddard advising him to check with avids european patent_attorney before demonstrating any of avids technology as it might affect avids patent rights in europe

the district_court discussed these documents and found that they also contributed to an inference that dr._stoddard was substantively involved in patent_matters related to the identification chip system
the documents related to the european filing refer to the same subject matter as the ¡¬326_patent and preparations for both patent_applications were underway at roughly the same time
given the nature and content of these communications and the district_courts findings with respect to dr._stoddards role in the company the inference that dr._stoddard was similarly involved in the ¡¬326_patent_application is reasonable and the finding of substantive_involvement is not clearly erroneous

additionally the district_court determined that dr._stoddards testimony at trial was not credible his memory of facts was suspiciously selective and he refused to acknowledge certain incontrovertible events.2 see inequitable_conduct_order at 4
the district_courts findings with respect to dr._stoddards lack of credibility as a witness cast doubt on dr._stoddards assertion that he did not understand the claimed technology and was not involved in the preparation of the ¡¬326_patent_application

our conclusion that the district_courts duty of candor analysis was not clearly erroneous is reinforced by our own review of the entire record and relevant case law which reveals sufficient reason to uphold the district_courts judgment
cf
bruno indep
living aids inc. v. acorn mobility servs ltd. 394_f.3d_1348 1354 fed.cir.2005` while the district_court indeed provided little explicit support for its finding of intent it is well established that as an appellate tribunal we review judgments not opinions
we therefore focus our review on whether there is sufficient evidence in the record to sustain the judgment of intent to deceive the pto'
( citing black v. cutter labs. 351_u.s._292 297 76_s.ct._824 100_l.ed._1188_(1956) ; stratoflex inc. v. aeroquip corp. 713_f.2d_1530 1540 fed.cir.1983 ; consol aluminum corp. v. foseco int l ltd. 910_f.2d_804 814 fed.cir.1990` an appellate court need not close its eyes to the record where.. there is a way clearly open to affirm the district_courts action
``

dr._stoddard was personally responsible for the disputed prior_art_demonstrations
he was in contact with at least one of the inventors during the preparation of the ¡¬326_patent_application regarding patent-related matters
he was also advised by that inventor to check with a patent_attorney before disclosing information about avids technology to the public
he signed the small_entity_status_affidavit shortly before the application was filed
these facts lend further support to the inference that dr._stoddard was substantively involved in preparations for filing the application and demonstrate that dr._stoddard *976 spoke for avid in representations to the pto

although dr._stoddard did not contribute enough to the patentable features of the claims to be considered an inventor the functionality of the system described in the ¡¬326_patent was his idea
the inventors he hired were specifically instructed to reduce his idea to practice
dr._stoddards inclusion on substantive communications related to the preparation of the european counterpart to the ¡¬326_patent_application further support the more general conclusion that he was substantively involved in preparation of the patent_application covering the system he conceived

under the terms of rule 56 the pto does not assign a duty of candor to persons not associated with a patent_application or to those involved only in a ministerial capacity
such persons would not be in a position to appreciate that their conduct or knowledge might be relevant to the pto.3 the district_court did not clearly err in determining that dr._stoddard was not such an exempt person
indeed to accept avids argument that a person such as dr._stoddard owes no duty of candor would allow intentional deception by the types of people most likely to have knowledge of ¡± 102 b prior_art i.e. those on the commercial_side of patented_product_development

the dissent errs by conflating rule 56s requirements of substantive_involvement and knowledge that the undisclosed information is material
according to the dissent the` substantively involved' has a knowledge requirement ; the person must be` able to assess the materiality of any information [ that person ] may know or discover'
dissent at 978
the dissents proposed definition fails however because that is not what rule 56 says
involvement and knowledge are separate inquiries under rule 56 located in separate sections subsections c and a respectively and serving different purposes
under ¡± 1.56 c we ask whether a person is substantively involved with the preparation or prosecution of a patent_application in order to determine whether that person is associated with the filing and prosecution of a patent_application and thus owes a duty of candor to the pto under ¡± 1.56 a
nothing in ¡± 1.56 c 3 requires as the dissent suggests the individual be` able to assess the materiality of any information [ he ] may know or discover' in order to be substantively involved
dissent at 978
rather what a person knew or should have known only matters after he is found to be` associated with the filing and prosecution of a patent_application' such as by being substantively involved
id.¡± 1.56 a

in other words a finding that an individual was` substantively involved in the preparation or prosecution' of a patent_application only determines that the individual owed a duty of candor to the pto
whether the individual involved in the alleged misconduct owed a duty of candor to the pto is merely a threshold_inquiry in the inequitable_conduct analysis
once a court finds that the individual had a duty of candor the court must proceed to the *977 dual prongs of materiality and deceptive_intent to determine whether that duty was violated
this subsequent analysis in particular the deceptive_intent inquiry encompasses the concerns raised by the dissent
if an individual is unable to assess the materiality of the information at issue then he would lack the deceptive_intent required to find that he committed inequitable_conduct.4 therefore the dissents main objection to our` substantive_involvement' test is misplaced

based on the district_courts findings and on the entirety of the evidence of record we hold that the district_court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting avids argument that dr._stoddard owed no duty of candor to the pto
dr._stoddard withheld material_information regarding his sales_demonstrations of products that reflected the closest_prior_art to the claims of the ¡¬326_patent
dr._stoddard acted with deceptive_intent
dr._stoddards actions are imputed to avid the patent holder
we therefore affirm the district_courts judgment that avids ¡¬326_patent is unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct

linn circuit_judge concurring-in-part and dissenting-in-part
i am pleased to join parts i and iia of the majority opinion concluding that there remains a live_controversy between the parties on the issue of unenforceability of u.s._patent_no._5235,326` the ¡¬326_patent` and affirming the district_courts materiality ruling
i respectfully dissent however from part iib affirming the district_courts ruling that the duty of candor required by 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 c 3 applies to dr._stoddard

this case involves the application of 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56` rule 56' a rule adopted by the united states patent and trademark_office` pto' that places on defined individuals a duty of candor and good_faith including a duty of disclosure in dealing with the pto during the period of examination of a patent_application
37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 a
these individuals include 1 each named inventor ; 2 each attorney or agent who prepares or prosecutes the application ; and 3` [ e ] very other_person who is substantively involved in the preparation or prosecution of the application and who is associated with the inventor with the assignee or with anyone to whom there is an obligation to assign the application'
37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 c
since dr._stoddard is not a named inventor or an attorney or agent associated with the filing of the ¡¬ 326 patent the question presented in this case turns on the application of rule 56 c 3 which as the majority recognizes has never been explicitly addressed by this court

rule 56 c 3 lists two criteria that must be met before imposing a duty of disclosure on an individual
first the individual must be` substantively involved in the preparation or prosecution of the application'
37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 c 3
second the individual must be` associated with the inventor with the assignee or with anyone to whom there is an obligation to assign the application'
id
i agree with the majority that dr._stoddard was associated with the inventors of the ¡¬326_patent and that the second prong of rule 56 c 3 is met in this case
where i part company with the majority is the conclusion that dr._stoddard was` substantively involved in *978 the preparation or prosecution of the [326_patent ] application' as required by the first prong of rule 56 c 3

we review a district_courts determination of inequitable_conduct under an abuse of discretion_standard
kingsdown_med consultants_ltd. v. hollister_inc. 863_f.2d_867 876 fed.cir.1988 en banc
`` we will not substitute our judgment for that of the trial court in relation to the discretionary ruling of inequitable_conduct unless the appellant establishes that the ruling is based upon clearly erroneous findings of fact or a misapplication or misinterpretation of applicable law or that the ruling evidences a clear_error of judgment on the part of the district_court'
brasseler u.s.a
i l.p. v. stryker sales corp. 267_f.3d_1370 1379 fed.cir.2001
in my view the district_court both misapplied rule 56 c 3 and clearly erred in finding that dr._stoddard was` substantively involved in the preparation or prosecution of the application'
accordingly i would reverse the determination that the ¡¬ 326 patent is unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct

i
who owes the duty of candor
the majority correctly recognizes that the duty of candor is codified at 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 and includes the duty to disclose to the pto all information that is material to the issue of patentability known to certain individuals
37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 a
as the majority further notes the question in this case is to whom does the duty of candor extend under the language` every other_person who is substantively involved' in rule 56 c 3 ?

the majority holds that a district_court may consider an` individuals position within the company role in developing or marketing the patented_idea contact with the inventors or prosecutors and representations to the pto' when deciding whether an individual is` substantively involved' regardless of whether those factors relate to the persons awareness of the merits of the application in question or engagement in any specific activity relating to that application

the majority goes even further to extend the duty generally to` those on the commercial_side of patented_product_development' because they are` the types of people most likely to have knowledge of ¡± 102 b prior_art'
majority_op.at 976
with all due_respect i find no basis in the rule or in any policy for such an expansive reading of rule 56 c 3

the obligation imposed by the duty of candor is to disclose to the pto information` material to patentability'
37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 a
because one can not assess whether information is` material to patentability' without knowledge of the technical_details or legal_merits of an application it should be self-evident that when rule 56 c 3 talks about persons who are` substantively involved' it is referring to those persons who are both 1 engaged in the preparation or prosecution of an application and 2 sufficiently apprised of the technical_details or legal_merits of the application as to be able to assess the materiality of any information they may know or discover as the application is prepared or prosecuted
this naturally excludes not only the` typists clerks and similar personnel who assist with the application' in a non-substantive way as described in the manual of patent examining procedure` mpep' ¡± 2001.01 but also corporate officers managers employees and all other individuals who are neither aware of the technical_details or legal_merits of the application nor engaged in the preparation or prosecution thereof
simply having a general interest or even a financial interest in the invention or a general *979 awareness of the application is not enough

this interpretation does not improperly import into rule 56 c 3 the knowledge component from materiality as suggested by the majority
majority_op.at 976
instead it recognizes that rule 56 c 3 uses the phrase` substantively involved'
the use of the word` substantive [ ]' limits the set of individuals who have a duty to disclose to those who possess a specific understanding of the substance of the application
this has nothing to do with the question of whether any particular_piece of information is material but relates to the separate question of whether a person is substantively involved ; i.e. sufficiently apprised of the details of the application as to be in a position to make that assessment
reading the separate parts of rule 56 in harmony is not improperly conflating them as the majority suggests

the majority reads` substantive [ ]' to mean that the involvement` relates to the content of the application or decision related thereto and that the involvement is not wholly administrative or secretarial in nature'
majority_op.at 974 citing mpep_¡± 2001.01 8th_ed. rev.2 may 2004
such an expansive interpretation is nowhere suggested in the cited section of the mpep or anywhere in rule 56
the pto could easily have written a rule as broad as that set forth by the majority
however the pto purposefully limited the duty of disclosure to material_information in order to limit the submission of irrelevant and cumulative information that could overwhelm the pto and obscure potentially important disclosures
see duty of disclosure 42_fed.reg._5589_(jan._28,_1977)`relevant is replaced bymaterial because the latter term connotes something more than a trivial relationship
`` ; mpep_¡± 2001 8th_ed. rev.2 may 2004` there is no duty to submit information which is not material to the patentability of any existing claim`
by extension the pto also limited the duty to those individuals in a position to determine what disclosures are material-those substantively involved in the preparation or prosecution of the application

while i do not quibble about the majoritys characterization of this as a threshold_inquiry calling it such does not justify writing` substantively' out of the rule and lowering the threshold to extend the duty to disclose to everyone having some relationship to the invention or application no matter how peripheral or tangential it may be to the substance of the application
the majoritys interpretation places on persons who are not in a position to assess materiality an obligation to disclose information the relevance of which they have no way of determining
the effect is either to encourage the filing of information regardless of its materiality just to be on the safe side or to widen the net of inequitable_conduct that may be cast by accused infringers after the fact in litigation
neither result is desired or warranted and can not be justified on the rationalization that rule 56 c 3 is simply an innocuous threshold_inquiry
indeed this court has held that the identity of the individual accused of inequitable_conduct is essential to the determination of whether the patent can be found unenforceable
see exergen_corp. v. wal-mart_stores inc. 575_f.3d_1312 1330 fed.cir.2009` the pleading however provides no factual basis to infer that any specific individual who owed a duty of disclosure in prosecuting the ¡¬685_patent knew of the specific information in the [ prior_art ] patents that is alleged to be material to the claims of the ¡¬685_patent
``

finally the majority suggests that intent should solve the concern i have expressed
majority_op.at 976-77
with all due_respect that suggestion is premised *980 on circular reasoning that ignores rule 56 c 3 entirely
if intent was all that mattered there would be no need to be concerned at all about who had the duty to disclose

ii
dr._stoddards involvement
in this case there is no evidence that dr._stoddard was substantively involved in the preparation or prosecution of the application for the ¡¬326_patent
specifically there is no evidence to even suggest that dr._stoddard had any knowledge of the technical_details or legal_merits of the application for the ¡¬326_patent while it was being prepared or prosecuted
i find it significant that no document or testimony shows that dr._stoddard participated in any inventor meeting with patent counsel received a draft of the application prior to filing or received any draft response of an office action to the pto during prosecution or was otherwise apprised of the technical_details or legal merit of the application
in fact robert malm the prosecuting attorney of the ¡¬326_patent testified that dr._stoddard was not substantively involved in the preparation or prosecution of the patent
j.a
14100 14104 malms testimony stating that he did not have any conversations with dr._stoddard about patent prosecution matters and that no individual at avid reviewed responses before they were filed with the pto

the majority cites two communications as evidence sufficient to support the district_courts inference that dr._stoddard was substantively involved in the ¡¬326_application
majority_op.at 974-75
neither of these documents actually related to the ¡¬326_application
the first memo addressed to dr._stoddard from a named inventor of the ¡¬326_patent mentioned only the possible effect of avid sales on a european_patent_application
the second memo which indicated that dr._stoddard was provided a copy was addressed to a patent_attorney who was never involved in the ¡¬326_patent_application and included new material for an unspecified patent_application
this memo did not give any indication that it was in any way related to the ¡¬326_patent_application
these documents do not support the conclusion that dr._stoddard had any awareness of the details or merits of the ¡¬326_application

the majority incorrectly points to dr._stoddards involvement in avids research and development as a factor indicating that he was substantively involved in the preparation of the patent_application relating to that research
majority_op.at 974-75
dr._stoddards research activities are simply evidence that dr._stoddard was` associated with the inventor with the assignee or with anyone to whom there is an obligation to assign the application'
37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 c 3
because it is the actual substance of the application that defines what constitutes` material' information that the individual must disclose to the pto rule 56 requires more than just this association
see 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 b 1 c 3

the majority also ascribes significance to the fact that dr._stoddard was personally responsible for certain prior_art_demonstrations
majority_op.at 975-76
however this fact does not contribute to a finding that dr._stoddard was substantively involved in the patent_application
while employees who perform product_demonstrations may well be the individuals most likely to have knowledge of prior_art that knowledge in itself does not give rise to a duty of disclosure to the pto
see kemin foods l.c
v. pigmentos vegetales del centro s.a. de c.v. 464_f.3d_1339 1346 fed.cir.2006 affirming district_courts refusal to find inequitable_conduct based on the failure of an employee scientist *981 -not a named inventor-to disclose a prior_art reference noting that he was` only tangentially involved in prosecution' of the patent
unless such an individual also has knowledge of the technical_details or legal_merits of the patent_application and is engaged in the preparation or prosecution thereof he is not bound by rule 56
moreover while the district_court found dr._stoddards testimony on the issue of prior_art_demonstrations was less than candid that neither shows that he was involved in the ¡¬326_patent_application nor demonstrates that whatever involvement he may have had was substantive in any way

finally dr._stoddards signature on the small_entity_status_affidavit declaring that avid is a small business concern eligible for reduced patent_application fees provides no evidence that he had any knowledge of the substantive details contained in the patent_application
the small entity status document relates only to information about the corporation and not to anything material to patentability

the majority states that dr._stoddard is substantively involved in the application for the ¡¬326_patent based on the entirety of the evidence in the record
however as noted above none of the individual pieces of evidence the majority cites as the basis for this finding-dr._stoddards role in the company the two memos regarding patent prosecution the small_entity_status_affidavit dr._stoddards involvement in the product_demonstrations or dr._stoddards lack of credibility at trial-show that dr._stoddard was even peripherally involved with the actual application at issue
simply combining the evidence does not change the fact that there is nothing in the record showing that dr._stoddard had anything at all to do with the application for the ¡¬326_patent

for the foregoing reasons it is my view that the evidence does not support a finding that dr._stoddard was substantively involved in the preparation or prosecution of the ¡¬326_patent
he was neither engaged in the preparation or prosecution of the ¡¬326_patent_application nor sufficiently apprised of its technical_details or legal_merits to allow him to assess what information would be considered material to its patentability
because the district_court misapplied rule 56 c 3 and clearly erred in extending the duty of disclosure to dr._stoddard i would reverse the finding that the ¡¬326_patent is unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct

the district_courts use of` avid' in these findings is not entirely clear because only individuals rather than corporations such as avid owe a duty of candor to the pto
exergen_corp. v. wal-mart_stores inc. 575_f.3d_1312 1328 fed.cir.2009 ; manual of patent_examining_procedures_¡± 2001.01 explaining that` the duty applies only to individuals not to organizations'
accordingly only individuals can breach that duty and give rise to a finding of inequitable_conduct
id
although the district_court opinion mentions a few different individuals it appears that all of its inequitable_conduct conclusions with respect to` avid' refer to the conduct of dr._stoddard that is imputed to avid
see avid identification sys inc. v. crystal_import_corp. 2007_wl_2901415 no._204-cv-183 slip op.at 8 e.d.tex

for example dr._stoddard was avids main fact witness on the issue of patent validity and the district_court explicitly discredited the portions of his testimony relevant to the validity of the ¡¬326_patent under ¡± 102 b
3
our holding does not automatically extend the duty of candor to all individuals who contact one of the inventors or sign the small entity affidavit
nor does our holding extend the duty generally to all individuals on the commercial_side of product development
we simply hold that the district_court may properly consider a variety of factors such as an individuals position within the company role in developing or marketing the patented_idea contact with the inventors or prosecutors and representations to the pto in deciding whether that individual is` substantively involved' within the meaning of ¡± 1.56 c 3 and thus owes a duty of candor to the pto
4
as occurred here the district_court may find the same evidence probative of whether a person was` substantively involved' and whether that person acted with deceptive_intent
the inquiries however are distinct
