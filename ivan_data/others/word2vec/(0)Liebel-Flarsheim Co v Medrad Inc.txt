lourie circuit_judge
liebel-flarsheim company and mallinckrodt inc. collectively` liebel' appeal from the decision of the united_states_district_court for the southern_district of ohio granting medrads motion for summary_judgment that four of liebels patents are invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡±¡± 112_and_102
liebel-flarsheim_co. v. medrad inc. no._01- cv-98-858 2005_wl_2840744_(s.d.ohio_oct._28,_2005)
medrad_cross-appeals from the decision of the district_court granting liebels motion for summary_judgment that medrad infringed the asserted patents and that the inventorship_designation on liebels patents is correct
medrad also cross-appeals from the holding that the inequitable_conduct_counterclaim was moot in light of the district_courts invalidity_rulings
because we conclude that liebels patents are invalid the front-loading_patents for lack of enablement and the syringe-sensing patents on anticipation we affirm the district_courts judgment of invalidity
as a result the cross-appeals on infringement and inventorship need not be reached
we also affirm the courts decision that the inequitable_conduct_counterclaim is presently moot

background
this is the second time this case has been on appeal in our court
the detailed facts of the case are presented in our previous opinion and we present here only those facts relevant to this appeal
see liebel-flarsheim_co. v. medrad inc. 358_f.3d_898 fed.cir.2004` liebel_i'
this appeal concerns asserted claims of four of liebels patents claims 10 11 13 and 16-19 of u.s._patent 5,456,669 ; claims 1 8 9 11-13 15 16 18 22 27 28 30-33 and 34-37 of u.s._patent 5,658,261 ; claims 7 8 10 and 11 of u.s._patent 5,662,612 ; and claims 1 2 4 5 7 8 10 11 13 14 16 17 19 20 22 and 23 of u.s._patent 5,928,197
the ¡¬669 and ¡¬261_patent s hereinafter the` front-loading_patents' share a common_specification and are directed to a front-loading fluid_injector with a replaceable syringe capable of withstanding high pressures for delivering a contrast agent to a patient
the ¡¬612 and ¡¬197_patent s hereinafter the` syringe-sensing patents' also share a common_specification and are directed to a computer-controlled injector wherein a motor advances and retracts a plunger located within the syringe

with regard to the asserted claims of the front-loading_patents this appeal challenges the district_courts holding of invalidity following our prior claim_construction regarding a pressure_jacket
claim 10 of the ¡¬669_patent is representative of the asserted claims of the front-loading_patents and reads as follows a method of loading a tubular replacement syringe into a high pressure power injector for injecting fluid into an animal the method comprising the steps of providing a power injector having a syringe receiving opening with a generally circular periphery therein adapted to receive a rearward_end of a syringe having a generally circular_rim a ram and a motor linked to the ram and operable to reciprocate the ram *1374 along a segment of a line projecting through the opening ; and providing a hollow tubular syringe that includes a cylindrical body having an axis a generally circular_rim a rearward_end and a closed forward end with a fluid discharge orifice therein and
a plunger axially slidable in the body the syringe body being structurally capable of withstanding at least from the rim to the orifice fluid at an operating pressure of at least 100 psi within the interior thereof ; then inserting into the opening by generally rearward axial movement of the syringe the rearward_end of the body ; rotating the syringe in the opening a fraction of a turn to thereby lock the body around the rim to the injector around the periphery of the opening ; and
engaging the plunger with the ram ; then energizing the motor and thereby driving the ram forward along the line and parallel to the axis to move the plunger axially forward at a programmed speed to inject the fluid at the operating pressure from within the syringe and through the orifice at a programmed rate into the animal
¡¬669_patent col. 15_ll._17 -50
the claims in the originally-filed application1 explicitly recited a pressure_jacket in front of the syringe receiving opening
during the prosecution of the front-loading_patents liebel removed all references in the claims to a pressure_jacket
medrad asserted and the district_court agreed that during the prosecution of the front-loading_patents the applicants became aware of medrads jacketless_injector_system and then deleted all references to a pressure_jacket in the asserted claims in order to encompass medrads injector within the scope of the claims
the examiner allowed the claims and the claims as issued do not contain an explicit recitation of a pressure_jacket

even though the claims do not expressly recite a pressure_jacket the district_court initially construed the asserted claims of the front-loading_patents as requiring a pressure_jacket
based on that construction the district_court granted summary_judgment of noninfringement in favor of medrad because medrads accused devices do not contain a pressure_jacket

in the first appeal to this court we reversed the district_courts claim_construction and determined that the asserted claims of the front-loading_patents do not require a pressure_jacket
we first considered the language of the claims and observed that neither claim 10 of the ¡¬669_patent nor any of the other asserted claims expressly mentions a pressure_jacket
we further rejected the district_courts conclusion that the term` opening' in independent claim 10 of the ¡¬669_patent must be limited to an opening in a pressure_jacket
we then considered the specification and determined that although all the described embodiments include a pressure_jacket *1375 the disclosure did not clearly disavow embodiments lacking a pressure_jacket
we also observed that the prosecution_history indicates that the asserted claims purposefully did not include a pressure_jacket_limitation in order to cover devices that lacked a pressure_jacket
in light of the intrinsic evidence we declined to limit the claims to require a pressure_jacket
although medrad argued that we should construe the claims narrowly to preserve their validity we declined to do so stating that the question of validity was a separate issue that could be addressed on remand
liebel_i 383 f.3d at 912

on remand and in light of our claim_construction the district_court concluded that medrads devices did infringe the asserted claims of the front-loading_patents but that those claims were invalid for lack of compliance with the written description and enablement_requirements of the statute
the district_court reasoned that the claims were invalid for lack of written description because the specification does not describe a jacketless_injector
the court noted that the written description of the invention is directed to the improvement of` loading and unloading a syringe given the constraints presented by the pressure_jacket'

the district_court also concluded that the asserted claims were invalid for lack of enablement after considering the specification and the factors set forth in in re wands 858_f.2d_731_(fed.cir.1988)
the court observed that a pressure_jacket was necessary to` maintain the integrity of the syringe housing against pressures the syringe encounters during operation of the injector'
the court further noted that the inventors themselves testified as to the importance of the pressure_jacket around the syringe and that the experiments with and testing of jacketless_systems were unsuccessful
the court also relied on testimony of liebels engineers that a jacketless_system was not a mere design option and that one skilled in the art would not know how to make a jacketless_system
the court further found that no prototypes of a jacketless_injector had been made or described at the time of filing and that the state of the art was such that a jacketless_system with a disposable_syringe would have been a` true innovation'
thus the court concluded that medrad had proffered clear and convincing_evidence that the specification does not satisfy the written description and enablement_requirements

with respect to the syringe-sensing patents this appeal challenges the holding of invalidity following our construction of the term` physical_indicia' and its relationship to the properties of the syringe
claim 7 of the ¡¬612_patent is representative of the asserted claims of the syringe-sensing patents and reads as follows an injector of the type having a motor which advances and retracts a plunger located within a syringe toward and away from a nozzle located at a distal end of the syringe to inject fluid into or out of an animal subject adapted for use with syringe assemblies which have differing capacities comprising a detector located proximate to a syringe installed on said injector for detecting a physical_indicia [ sic ] on said syringe related to the capacity of said syringe and generating an electrical signal representative of said physical_indicia and
a control_circuit which causes said motor to move and tracks the location of said motor while moving said motor wherein said control_circuit *1376 computes the location of a plunger within said syringe relative to an end of said syringe by relating said electrical signal to the tracked location of said motor
¡¬612_patent col. 18_ll._36 -52 emphases added
the remaining asserted claims of the ¡¬197 and ¡¬612_patent s differ from representative_claim 7 of the ¡¬612_patent in that some are directed to a method of controlling an injector claims 4 5 10 11 16 17 22 and 23 of the ¡¬197_patent and claim 10 of the ¡¬612_patent and some are dependent_claims that recite the additional limitation of ceasing motion of the motor and plunger when the plunger or ram connected to the plunger has reached the end of the syringe claims 2 5 8 11 14 17 20 and 23 of the ¡¬197_patent and claims 8_and_11 of the ¡¬612_patent
in addition the asserted claims of the syringe-sensing patents recite physical_indicia related to properties of the syringe other than the` capacity of said syringe' as recited in representative_claim 7 of the ¡¬612_patent
such properties include the distance of the plunger or ram coupled to the plunger from an end of the syringe claims 1 4 13 and 16 of the ¡¬197_patent the range of travel of an injector_ram coupled to the plunger claims 19_and_22 of the ¡¬197_patent and the amount of fluid in the syringe claims 7_and_10 of the ¡¬197_patent

in its claim_construction prior to our decision in liebel_i the district_court had considered the meaning of the term` physical_indicia'
it disagreed with medrad that the term should be limited to indicia representing the length of the extender
the court determined that the claim language was broader than medrads proposed construction because the claims recited syringe properties other than the length of the extender

on appeal in liebel_i medrad had argued that we should construe the term` physical_indicia' to be limited to features that indicate the length of the extender
liebel_i 358 f.3d at 912
after considering the language of the claims the specification and the prosecution_history we determined that the district_court correctly concluded that the term` physical_indicia' is not limited to indicia related to the length of an extender
id.at 914
we again stated that we would not construe the claims narrowly because of invalidity concerns and that the issue of invalidity could be addressed on remand
id

on remand and in light of our construction the district_court determined that medrads accused device did infringe the asserted claims of the syringe-sensing patents but that those claims were invalid for failure to comply with the requirements of ¡± 112 and because of anticipation by medrads u.s._patent 5,383,858
with regard to written description the district_court stated that there was` nothing in the written description that describes an invention for detecting indicia e.g. a tangible mark on the syringe-other than the limited alternative reference to physical_indicia relating to the length of the extender'
the district_court noted that the preferred_embodiment` teaches that it is the injectors face plate which is removable and interchangeable that isdetected by a sensor which in turn tells the circuit board the size of the syringe installed'
the court also observed that the written description and enablement_requirements often rise and fall together and determined that the asserted claims of the front-loading_patents` are of a far greater scope than [ liebels ] specification of what it invented or possessed when it filed its application'
the court concluded that the specification failed to fulfill both the written *1377 description and enablement_requirements set forth in ¡± 112 ?
1

with regard to anticipation the court found that even if it had concluded that liebels patents were not invalid under ¡± 112 the asserted claims of the syringe-sensing patents were anticipated by the prior_art ¡¬858_patent
the court found that the ¡¬858_patent clearly describes an indicator mechanism for injecting fluid from a syringe into a patient and that mechanism includes an injector_controller and a sensor
the court further determined that the ¡¬858_patent discloses` physical_indicia' by describing the use of a bar_code or another readable device on the syringe that stores information about the syringe and that can be read by a sensor
the court determined that the only difference between the asserted claims of the syringe-sensing patents and the invention disclosed in the ¡¬858_patent was the description of the types of indicia detected
for example the ¡¬858_patent describes that the bar_code on the syringe can include information relating to the` dimensions' of the syringe whereas the asserted claims recite the` capacity' of the syringe
the court found that these were` semantic differences' that did not affect its conclusion of anticipation
hence the court concluded that the ¡¬858_patent anticipates the syringe-sensing patents

in a separate order the district_court considered whether the inventorship designated on the patents was correct and granted liebels motion for partial summary_judgment that it was correct
the court determined that the alleged omitted inventor kelly did not contribute to the conception of the design and thus was not properly a co-inventor
the court found that the evidence established that kelly only attended` brain-storming' sessions but that there was no clear and convincing_evidence of his being an inventor

the court further determined after resolving the invalidity motions that medrads inequitable_conduct claim was moot in light of its invalidity_rulings

liebel timely appealed and medrad_cross-appealed
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

*1378 a
the front-loading ¡¬669 and ¡¬261_patent s. on appeal liebel argues that the court erred in determining that the asserted claims of the front-loading_patents are invalid for lack of written description and enablement
with regard to enablement liebel contends that the court erroneously considered whether an injector without a pressure_jacket was enabled rather than limiting its inquiry to whether an injector with a pressure_jacket was enabled as it clearly was
liebel points out that the asserted claims do not recite or require the absence of a pressure_jacket and the court improperly focused on such an embodiment
because it is undisputed that liebel provided an enabling disclosure of what it calls its preferred_embodiment viz. an injector with a pressure_jacket liebel asserts that the court should have held that the disclosure was enabling for the full_scope of the claims
liebel further asserts that the court erred in concluding after considering the wands_factors that undue_experimentation would be required to practice the claimed invention without a pressure_jacket
according to liebel the testimony that the court relied upon only showed that additional work not undue_experimentation was required to develop an injector without a pressure_jacket
liebel also ascribes error to the courts consideration of various other pieces of testimony as support for its determination that producing the invention without a pressure_jacket would require undue_experimentation

medrad responds that the district_court correctly determined that under our claim_construction the asserted claims are invalid for lack of enablement
medrad argues that the court was correct in determining that the full_scope of the invention including the injector without a pressure_jacket is not enabled
according to medrad although every embodiment of a claim does not need to be disclosed in the specification the disclosure must teach the full range of embodiments in order for the claims to be enabled and here the disclosure does not teach an injector without a pressure_jacket
according to medrad consideration of the wands_factors also supports a determination that the asserted claims are not enabled
medrad observes that liebels own inventors admitted that they could not produce a successful pressure-jacketless_system and that that was compelling evidence of lack of enablement
medrad also cites other testimony that supports a finding of undue_experimentation

we agree with medrad that the district_court correctly determined that the asserted claims of the front-loading_patents are invalid for lack of enablement
the enablement_requirement is set forth in 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
1 and provides in pertinent part that the specification shall describe` the manner and process of making and using [ the invention ] in such full clear concise and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains or with which it is most nearly connected to make and use the [ invention ]'
we have stated that the` enablement_requirement is satisfied when one skilled in the art after reading the specification could practice the claimed invention without undue_experimentation'
ak_steel 344 f.3d at 1244 ; see also wands 858 f.2d at 736-37

we have previously construed the claims of the front-loading_patents such that they are not limited to an injector with a pressure_jacket and therefore the full_scope of the claimed inventions includes injectors *1379 with and without a pressure_jacket
that full_scope must be enabled and the district_court was correct that it was not enabled

turning first to consideration of the specification we find that nowhere does the specification describe an injector with a disposable_syringe without a pressure_jacket
in fact the specification teaches away from such an invention
in the` background of the invention' the specification describes general injectors and explains that during the injection phase a plunger is driven forward and pressure develops in the syringe ranging from 25 psi to over 1000 psi
without a pressure_jacket syringes that are able to withstand such high pressures are` expensive and therefore impractical where the syringes are to be disposable
accordingly many such injectors.. have been provided with pressure_jackets fixed to the injector units and into which the syringes are inserted'
¡¬669_patent col. 1_ll._23 -31
the specification thus teaches away from a disposable_syringe without a pressure_jacket by stating that such syringes are` impractical'
as we have held previously where the specification teaches against a purported aspect of an invention such a teaching` is itself evidence that at least a significant amount of experimentation would have been necessary to practice the claimed invention'
ak_steel 344 f.3d at 1244
moreover consideration of the remainder of the specification reveals that there is no guidance or suggestion of how to make or use a disposable_syringe for high pressure use without a pressure_jacket
all the figures in the patents depict a pressure_jacket and all discussion of them refers to the pressure_jacket

furthermore consideration of the testimonial_evidence presented supports a conclusion that no genuine_issue of material_fact exists as to whether undue_experimentation would have been required to make and use the injector without a pressure_jacket
the inventors admitted that they tried unsuccessfully to produce a pressure-jacketless_system and that producing such a system would have required more experimentation and testing
the inventors decided not to pursue such a system because it was` too risky'
the district_court relied on various statements in the record by the inventors that testing of a syringe without a pressure_jacket proved unsuccessful and that the inventors were not aware of any other similar testing being conducted at that time
moreover there was no indication of any prototype of a pressure-jacketless_injector having been made

liebel argues that language in spectra-physics inc. v. coherent inc. 827_f.2d_1524_(fed.cir.1987) that states that if an invention pertains to an art where the results are predictable e.g. in the mechanical arts then disclosure of a single embodiment can enable a broad claim supports its position
liebel asserts that because the specification enables one mode of making and using the invention in its preferred_embodiment viz. an injector with a pressure_jacket the enablement_requirement is satisfied and the inquiry should end there
see engel indus. inc. v. lockformer co. 946_f.2d_1528_(fed.cir.1991)

liebels reliance on spectra-physics is misplaced
in that case the specification disclosed different` attachment means' for making the claimed invention such as moly-manganese brazing and pulse-soldering but failed to disclose the best attachment means known to the inventors
we held that the asserted claims of the patent were invalid for failure to comply with the best mode requirement of ¡± 112 even *1380 though the specification enabled the practice of the claims
we did note that the specifications of other patents identified ticusil brazing as a suitable alternative attachment technique and thus that the asserted patents failure to mention ticusil brazing as an attachment means was` not fatal to enablement under ¡± 112'
spectra-physics 827 f.2d at 1533
indeed in that case disclosure of one attachment means permitted one skilled in the art to make and use the invention as broadly as it was claimed which included other attachment means known to one of ordinary_skill in the art
in contrast in this case disclosure of an injector_system with a pressure_jacket does not permit one skilled in the art to make and use the invention as broadly as it was claimed including without a pressure_jacket

the facts of this case are in fact more analogous to ak_steel than to spectra-physics
in ak_steel the patentee argued as it does here that the patent disclosed several embodiments within the properly construed claim and that the specification need not teach the full claimed scope in order for the claims to be enabled
344 f.3d at 1243
the claims in ak_steel read on steel strips containing either a type 1 or a type 2 aluminum_coating
the specification clearly described only type 2 aluminum_coating
we stated however that` as part of the quid pro quo of the patent bargain the applicants specification must enable one of ordinary_skill in the art to practice the full_scope of the claimed invention'
id.at 1244 latter emphasis added
we explained that the specification need not necessarily describe how to make and use every embodiment of the invention` because the artisans knowledge of the prior_art and routine experimentation can often fill in the gaps'
id
however because the full_scope of the claims included both type 1 and type 2 aluminum_coating the relevant inquiry became whether one skilled in the art would have been able to make and use a steel strip containing a type 1 aluminum_coating at the time of the patents effective filing date
id
we held that the specification taught against using a type 1 aluminum_coating and therefore that the claims were invalid for lack of enablement

similarly in this case the asserted claims read on and the full_scope of the claimed invention includes an injector_system with and without a pressure_jacket
there must be` reasonable enablement of the scope of the range' which in this case includes both injector_systems with and without a pressure_jacket
id

the specifications reference that teaches away from an injector_system with a disposable_syringe without a pressure_jacket combined with the testimonial_evidence that such a system could not have been produced at the time of filing supports the district_courts conclusion that the specification fails to fulfill the enablement_requirement of ¡± 112
because we are resolving this issue on the enablement ground we do not need to consider the written description holding of invalidity

the irony of this situation is that liebel successfully pressed to have its claims include a jacketless_system but having won that battle it then had to show that such a claim was fully enabled a challenge it could not meet
the motto` beware of what one asks for' might be applicable here

b
the syringe-sensing ¡¬612 and ¡¬197_patent s. on appeal liebel argues that medrad failed to provide clear and convincing *1381 evidence that the ¡¬858_patent anticipates the asserted claims of the syringe-sensing patents
in particular liebel asserts that the ¡¬858_patent does not disclose a control_circuit that computes the location of the plunger within the syringe stops the motor and plunger or determines that the plunger is at the end of the syringe as required by the claims

medrad responds that the district_court correctly decided that the ¡¬858_patent anticipates the asserted claims of the syringe-sensing patents
medrad asserts that the ¡¬858_patent expressly discloses an injector control that controls a motor and plunger by computing the location of the plunger
medrad also asserts that the district_court held that measuring actual plunger_movement is accomplished by` long-established potentiometer technology' and that the ¡¬858_patent incorporates two patents that discuss measuring plunger_movement
medrad finally contends that the ¡¬858_patent discloses detecting the same physical_indicia as the syringe-sensing patents

we agree with medrad that the district_court correctly determined that there is no genuine_issue of material_fact that the ¡¬858_patent anticipates2 the asserted claims of the syringe-sensing patents
a determination that a patent is invalid as anticipated under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 requires that a prior_art_reference disclose every limitation of the claimed invention either explicitly or inherently
telemac cellular corp. v. topp telecom inc. 247_f.3d_1316 1327 fed.cir.2001
the prior_art_reference in this case is medrads ¡¬858_patent which was cited to the pto during the prosecution of the syringe-sensing patents
although the burden of showing invalidity is` especially difficult' when the prior_art_reference was before the examiner during prosecution we find that medrad has met that burden here
see glaxo group ltd. v. apotex inc. 376_f.3d_1339 1348 fed.cir.2004

liebel first argues that the ¡¬858_patent fails to disclose the closed control_circuit that computes the location of a plunger as required by claim 7 of the ¡¬612_patent
we disagree
there is no genuine_issue of material_fact as to what the ¡¬858_patent discloses
the ¡¬858_patent discloses a syringe that is rotatably mountable on a front wall of an injector housing with an interference fit
although that patent expressly mentions an injector_controller it does not discuss the details of how the controller interacts with the motor and plunger
however the ¡¬858_patent incorporates by reference3 u.s._patent 4,006,736 assigned to medrad which clearly does discuss the details of the control_circuit and its interaction with the plunger
the ¡¬736_patent discloses a system for injecting fluid into a patient and it is replete with discussion of the control unit of that system operating the motor and tracking the plunger_movement
for example *1382 the patent expressly states that` as the motor drives the plunger the potentiometer tracks it so that the rate of movement and position may be derived'
¡¬736_patent col. 20_ll._21 -24 reference_characters omitted
the ¡¬736_patent further states that` the volume_circuit monitors the position of plunger after an injection begins to determine how much volume of contrast media has been delivered
and when the plunger has delivered the set volume the volume_circuit sends a signal to the time circuit to stop injecting'
¡¬736_patent col. 19_ll._32 -37 reference_characters omitted
the ¡¬858_patent which incorporates by reference the ¡¬736_patent therefore discloses a claimed control_circuit that computes the location of a plunger
in addition the limitation recited in some of the dependent_claims of the syringe-sensing patents-using the control_circuit to stop movement of the motor and plunger when the plunger is at the end of the syringe-is similarly disclosed in the ¡¬736_patent in the discussion pertaining to moving and retracting the plunger

liebel next asserts that the ¡¬858_patent fails to disclose physical_indicia related to various_parameters or properties of the syringe
we disagree again
in our claim_construction we determined that the term` physical_indicia' as liebel has argued is not limited to indicia related to the length of the extender
thus the full_scope of the claims includes the detection of physical_indicia other than detection of the length of the extender
those physical_indicia recited in the claims are the capacity of the syringe the distance of the plunger from an end of the syringe the amount of fluid in the syringe and the end of the travel position of an injector_ram coupled to the plunger

the ¡¬858_patent discloses using an encoding device such as a bar_code located on the syringe and a sensor located on the injector for reading the encoded device and forwarding signals to the injector_controller to modify the injector apparatus accordingly
¡¬858_patent col. 6_ll._31 -45
the ¡¬858_patent also states that as an alternative to the encoding device being a bar_code with spaced bars the encoding device can include raised surfaces corresponding to the spaced bars that would be read by an injector sensor or can include mechanically readable devices such as a slot hold or projection on the syringe or plunger that would send information concerning the type of syringe used to the circuits of the injector
¡¬858_patent col. 6_ll._51 -65
the ¡¬858_patent provides the following examples of the information that can be included in the encoding device` dimensions of the syringe content of the syringe in the case of a pre-filled syringe manufacturing information such as lot numbers dates and tool cavity number recommended contrast media flow rates and pressures and loading/injection_sequences'
¡¬858_patent col. 6_ll._45 -51
thus the ¡¬858_patent clearly discloses the detection of various_parameters of the syringe through the use of a bar_code or other marks on the syringe

liebel asserts that` dimensions of the syringe' are not the same as` capacity of the syringe' as recited in the asserted claims
as the district_court observed detecting dimensions of the syringe permits calculation of capacity using a basic volumetric formula
moreover the ¡¬858_patent expressly lists as an example of the type of information that can be included in the bar_code the` content of the syringe' which can encompass the capacity of the syringe as well as the amount of fluid in the syringe
the ¡¬858_patent also states that the encoding device can include the` loading/injection_sequences' which can *1383 encompass information related to the initial position of the plunger
moreover although the ¡¬858_patent only provides a few examples of the types of information that can be stored in the encoding device the list is not exclusive and may include other information logically related to the` dimensions' of the syringe or the` content' of the syringe such as the initial plunger position
thus there is no genuine_issue of material_fact that the ¡¬858_patent including the disclosure of the ¡¬736_patent that is incorporated by reference clearly discloses the limitations of the asserted claims of the syringe-sensing patents
the district_court therefore did not err in concluding that the syringe-sensing patents are invalid for anticipation as a matter of law

liebel argued for a broad construction of the term` physical_indicia' and in fact broadened its claims during prosecution to recite physical_indicia other than those indicating the length of an extender
once again liebel argued for a broad meaning and succeeded but suffers a pyrrhic victory

c. cross-appeals
because we affirm the district_courts conclusion that the asserted claims of the patents at issue are invalid we need not reach medrads cross-appealed issues concerning infringement and inventorship the latter actually being an alternative ground for a holding of invalidity not a proper basis for a cross-appeal.4

d. inequitable conduct
medrad finally argues that the district_court should not have dismissed as moot its counterclaim asserting inequitable_conduct
medrad asserts that that counterclaim is independent and distinct from an invalidity claim and it may be the basis for two additional remedies a determination that the entire_patent is unenforceable and an award of attorney_fees under 35 u.s.c.¡± 285

we agree with the district_court that the inequitable_conduct_counterclaim is moot
with regard to the argument that an inequitable_conduct_determination may render the entire_patent unenforceable medrad admitted during oral_arguments that such relief is not meaningful to medrad at this time
the only other additional relief that may be available to medrad by an inequitable_conduct_determination is attorney_fees under 35 u.s.c.¡± 285
medrad admitted during oral_arguments that although it plans to predicate an attorney fee application on inequitable_conduct it has not filed that application yet
we therefore affirm the decision that the inequitable_conduct_counterclaim is presently moot

conclusion
because the district_court correctly granted summary_judgment that liebels patents are invalid we affirm the conclusion that all the asserted claims are invalid the front-loading_patents on enablement and the syringe-sensing patents on anticipation grounds
because we find no error in the district_courts holding that the inequitable_conduct_counterclaim is moot we affirm that decision as well

affirmed

in 1991 liebel filed application serial no._07 /712,110 which issued as u.s._patent 5,300,031
the claims of the ¡¬031_patent include a pressure_jacket_limitation
the ¡¬669 and ¡¬261_patent s which do not recite a pressure_jacket_limitation resulted from continuation applications claiming priority from the ¡¬110 application

because we determine that the asserted claims of the syringe-sensing patents are invalid by reason of anticipation by the ¡¬858_patent we need not address written description or enablement issues which were the other grounds on which the district_court found the syringe-sensing patents to be invalid

medrad concedes that the arguments made on infringement provide alternate bases to find in its favor and that the arguments need only be addressed if we were to reverse on the issue of validity
