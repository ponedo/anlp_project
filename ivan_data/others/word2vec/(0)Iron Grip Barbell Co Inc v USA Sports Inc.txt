dyk circuit_judge
iron_grip barbell company` iron_grip' appeals from the judgment of the united_states_district_court for the central_district of california
the district_court found claims 1_to_3 and 6_to_8 of iron_grips patent u.s. patent no._6436,015` the015_patent` to be invalid as obvious
we affirm

*1319 background
iron_grip is a manufacturer of weight_plates used with fitness equipment such as barbells and is the assignee of the015_patent
claim 1 of the015_patent claims a weight_plate for physical fitness including a plate body formed with a central throughbore and.. further formed with solely a triad of spaced apart elongated handle openings disposed generally equiangularly.. said openings having respective outboard edges cooperating with said plate to define a triad of integral handle elements for grasping by a single hand to effect transport of said weight_plate
id
col._4,_ll._24-35 emphasis added
the other claims in the015_patent at issue here depend from claim 1 and are not different for present purposes

typically a barbell consists of a rigid bar and removable weight_plates attached on both ends
traditional weight_plates had a single hole in the center for attachment to the barbell
a key problem with traditional single-hole weight_plates was that they were difficult to grasp and transport
iron_grips015_patent addresses this defect of traditional weight_plates by disclosing a weight_plate with three elongated_openings near the periphery of the plate that function effectively as handles

during the prosecution of the015_patent iron_grip disclosed prior_art showing inter_alia weight_plates with one elongated grip u.s._patent_no._4199,140` the140_patent` and two elongated grips u.s. patent no._5137,502` the502_patent`
the examiner further considered other prior_art including barbell weight_plates with four openings
u.s._patent_no._4618,142
after multiple rejections on grounds of obviousness the015_patent eventually issued on aug._20,_2002

usa_sports inc.` usa_sports' is a competing manufacturer of weight_plates
it also manufactures a three-grip_plate
in may of 2002 iron_grip sued usa_sports in the district_court for infringement of an unrelated patent and subsequently amended its complaint to state an action for infringement of claims 1-big_token__3_and_6__big_token -8 of the015_patent
usa_sports defended on the basis that the asserted claims in the015_patent were invalid as obvious in light of the prior_art
both sides moved for summary_judgment
the district_court initially granted summary_judgment in favor of iron_grip finding that usa_sports weight_plate infringed the015_patent ; and denied usa_sports summary_judgment motion as to the invalidity of the015_patent holding that a finding of invalidity for obviousness required a` suggestion motivation or teaching in the prior_art to combine the elements [ from separate references ]'
( j.a.at 1897
upon motion for reconsideration however the district_court held that the contested claims in the015_patent were obvious
the district_court found that its prior understanding of the law was` unduly restrictive'
( j.a.at 2921
instead it held that` the cases.. permit the court to look at the overall_picture of whats really going on..
the obviousness test.. calls upon the court to just simply exercise common_sense..' id
applying this new test the district_court held that` it would have been obvious to a layman to combine the prior_art' and invalidated claims 1-big_token__3_and_6__big_token -8 of the015_patent
( j.a.at 3
iron_grip appeals
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 11

*1320 discussion
i
we review the district_courts grant of summary_judgment without deference
karsten mfg corp. v. cleveland golf co. 242_f.3d_1376 1379 fed.cir.2001
we therefore affirm the district_court only if there is no genuine issue of material fact as to the invalidity of the claims
in making this determination a patent is presumed to be valid
35 u.s.c.¡± 282 2000 ; cardinal chem co. v. morton int l 508_u.s._83 93_n._15 113_s.ct._1967 124_l.ed.2d_1_(1993)
usa_sports bears the burden of proving invalidity by clear and convincing_evidence
am
hoist & derrick co. v. sowa & sons inc. 725_f.2d_1350 1360 fed.cir.1984

in determining obviousness we employ the four-part test set forth in graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966)
this test requires us to examine 1 the scope and content of the prior_art ; 2 the level of ordinary_skill in the art ; 3 the differences between the claimed invention and the prior_art ; and 4 the objective_evidence of nonobviousness
id.at 17-18 86_s.ct._684 ; see also 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 2000

we note that neither side disputes that weight_plates showing one two and four elongated_openings were within the prior_art
we also note that neither side disputes that the proper level of ordinary_skill in the art is that of a layman
therefore the only points of contention in the obviousness inquiry are the differences between the claimed invention and the prior_art and the objective_evidence of nonobviousness

ii
we turn first to a comparison between the prior_art and the claimed invention
in this inquiry we are mindful of the repeated warnings of the supreme court and this court as to the danger of hindsight bias
see e.g. graham 383 u.s. at 36 86_s.ct._684 consideration of secondary factors` serve [ s ] to guard against slipping into use of hindsight and to resist the temptation to read into the prior_art the teachings of the invention in issue' internal_quotations and citations omitted ; in re kotzab 217_f.3d_1365 1369 fed.cir.2000` [ t ] he very ease with which the invention can be understood may prompt one to fall victim to the insidious effect of a hindsight syndrome wherein that which only the invention taught is used against its teacher'
( internal_quotations omitted
we note in this respect that the district_courts use of an` overall_picture' and` common_sense' test of obviousness falls squarely into the hindsight trap
see in re lee 277_f.3d_1338 1345 fed.cir.2002

where an invention is contended to be obvious based upon a combination of elements across different references our cases require that there be a suggestion motivation or teaching to those skilled in the art for such a combination
in re fine 837_f.2d_1071 1074 fed.cir.1988
this requirement prevents the use of` the inventors disclosure as a blueprint for piecing together the prior_art to defeat patentability-the essence of hindsight'
ecolochem inc. v. so
cal
edison co. 227_f.3d_1361 1371-72 fed.cir.2000 quoting in re dembiczak 175_f.3d_994 999 fed.cir.1999

in this case however obviousness does not arise from any combination of elements from the prior_art
rather the issue of the015_patents obviousness arises because the prior_art showed one two and four elongated_handles on weight_plates
a single elongated handle on a weight_plate was disclosed by the140_patent
two elongated_handles on a weight_plate was disclosed by the502_patent
four elongated_handles on a *1321 weight_plate was disclosed by u.s. design patent no._4 06 183` the183_patent`
reproductions of the two and four grip_weight_plates in the prior_art and iron_grips three-grip_weight_plate appear below

?
the key feature of the015_patent the fact that there are three elongated_handles falls within a range disclosed by the prior_art
where the` prior_art.. discloses a range encompassing a somewhat narrower claimed range' the narrower range may be obvious
in re peterson 315_f.3d_1325 1330 fed.cir.2003
`` [ w ] hen the difference between the claimed invention and the prior_art is the range or value of a particular variable' then a patent should not issue if` the difference in range or value is minor'
haynes int l v. jessop steel co. 8_f.3d_1573 1577_n._3_(fed.cir.1993) ; see also titanium metals corp. of am
v. banner 778_f.2d_775 783 fed.cir.1985 invention found obvious because it was close to prior_art range
thus simply because an invention falls within a range disclosed by the prior_art does not necessarily make it per se obvious
both the genus and species may be patentable

*1322 nonetheless where there is a range disclosed in the prior_art and the claimed invention falls within that range there is a presumption of obviousness
but the presumption will be rebutted if it can be shown 1 that the prior_art taught away from the claimed invention in re geisler 116_f.3d_1465 1471 fed.cir.1997 ; or 2 that there are new and unexpected_results relative to the prior_art in re woodruff 919_f.2d_1575 1578 fed.cir.1990

there is to be sure one distinguishing feature of these range cases
each involved a range disclosed within a single patent while here the range is disclosed in multiple prior_art patents
but under the circumstances of this case that is a distinction without a difference
the prior_art suggested that a larger number of elongated grips in exercise weights was beneficial,2 thus plainly suggesting that one skilled in the art look to the range appearing in the prior_art
the prior_art disclosed weight_plates with one two and four elongated_handles
iron_grip is claiming a weight_plate with three elongated_handles within the range of the prior_art

it is also manifest that neither of the recognized exceptions applies here
first iron_grip offers no evidence that the prior_art taught away from the invention besides the broad conclusory statement that` the prior_art.. taught towards fewer grips'
( reply br
of appellant at 14
the prior_art does not support this conclusion
there is no evidence of` sufficient teaching away'
in re malagari 499_f.2d_1297 1303 c.c.p.a.1974

second there has been no showing that the three grips led to unexpected_results

where` the difference between the claimed invention and the prior_art is some range or other variable within the claims.. the [ patentee ] must show that the particular range is critical generally by showing that the claimed range achieves unexpected_results'
woodruff 919 f.2d at 1578
in the case of in re huang 100_f.3d_135_(fed.cir.1996) we sustained a finding of obviousness in a situation somewhat similar to that involved here
in huang the claimed invention was a shock-absorbing grip with a polyurethane_layer and a textile_layer
the difference between the huang_grip and the prior_art was that the huang_grip increased the thickness of the polyurethane_layer relative to the textile_layer and had greater shock-absorbing qualities
there was nothing new or unexpected about this result because the prior_art taught` that shock_absorption derives in part from the compressible nature of the polyurethane_layer
given that the polyurethane_layer absorbs shock one of ordinary_skill would logically infer that increasing the amount of the shock absorbing material the polyurethane would lead to an increase in the amount of shock_absorption'
id.at 139
the invention was obvious because
huangs contribution to the art could only lie in the specific thickness ratios recited in the claims
this court and its predecessors have long held.. that even though [ a ] modification results in great improvement and utility over the prior_art it may still not be patentable if the modification was within the capabilities of one skilled in the art unless the claimed ranges` produce a new and unexpected result which is different in kind and not merely in degree from the results of the prior_art'
*1323 id
( quoting in re aller 42_c.c.p.a._824 220_f.2d_454 456 1955

there is no indication of any new and unexpected_results from the use of a three-grip_plate in the015_patent or the prosecution_history
the only benefit iron_grip discloses in the patent regarding a three-grip_plate is that` [ t ] his construction allows a user to quickly find a handle element quickly [ sic ] and effortlessly'
'015_patent col._4,_ll._3-4
there is no explanation why as compared to the two or four grip_plates in the prior_art a three-grip_plate has advantages in this regard
a review of the prosecution_history is likewise uninformative
in addition to the benefit of allowing a user to find a handle quickly and effortlessly the examiner cites the ability of the user to grasp the handles of the plate with two hands at an appropriate angle as a reason for allowing the claim
( j.a.at 1237
there is again no explanation of why such an effect could not likewise be achieved using a plate with two or four handles as existed in the prior_art
we conclude that the patent and its prosecution_history do not disclose any new and unexpected_results from having three elongated grips on a weight_plate
nor has iron_grip shown new and unexpected_results based on evidence outside the patent and its prosecution_history

finally iron_grip argues that huang is inapposite because it was an appeal from the board of patent appeals and interferences` board' and submits that it stands for the proposition of deference to the examiner and the board
there is no merit to iron_grips contention
it is well-settled that` [ o ] bviousness is a legal question based on underlying factual determinations' and in appeals from the board` [ w ] e review the ultimate legal determination of obviousness without deference'
in re zurko 258_f.3d_1379 1383-84 fed.cir.2001 ; see in re mccarthy 763_f.2d_411 412 fed.cir.1985
here there is no factual issue
on the legal issue of obviousness as opposed to the underlying factual issues the grant of a patent does not create a presumption of validity beyond the requirement that the party seeking to invalidate a patent must prove invalidity by clear and convincing_evidence
ssih equip
s.a. v. usitc 718_f.2d_365 375 fed.cir.1983

because the claimed invention falls within a range disclosed in the prior_art and the patentee has not shown that the prior_art taught away from the invention or new and unexpected_results from a three elongated grip_weight_plate as compared to those in the prior_art we conclude that the claims are obvious absent substantial evidence of pertinent secondary factors supporting patentability.3

iii
we now consider whether the patentee has demonstrated secondary evidence of nonobviousness
we have previously held that in` determining the question of obviousness inquiry should always be made into whatever objective_evidence of nonobviousness there may be'
vandenberg v. dairy equip co. 740_f.2d_1560 1567 fed.cir.1984 ; see also alza corp. v. mylan labs inc. 391_f.3d_1365 1373 n.9 2004_wl_2827673 no._04-1344 slip op.at 12_n._9_(fed.cir._dec._10,_2004)
the district_courts opinion here did not consider the patentees claimed evidence
`` our precedents.. establish that failure to cite secondary *1324 considerations alone is not reversible error'
ruiz v. a.b
chance co. 234_f.3d_654 668 fed.cir.2000
`` where the evidence of record is unchallenged as to secondary considerations ignored by the decision maker this court may as a matter of law consider this objective_evidence in reviewing the ultimate conclusion of obviousness/nonobviousness entered by the trial court' without the need for a remand
ashland oil inc. v. delta resins & refractories inc. 776_f.2d_281 307 fed.cir.1985
because in considering this record evidence we conclude that it does not show the existence of relevant secondary factors to support patentability we affirm the district_court

this court has previously identified inter_alia commercial_success satisfaction of a long-felt need and copying to be relevant factors in this inquiry
see demaco corp. v. f. von langsdorff licensing ltd. 851_f.2d_1387 1392 fed.cir.1988 commercial_success ; uniroyal inc. v. rudkin-wiley corp. 837_f.2d_1044 1054 fed.cir.1988 long-felt need ; pro-mold & tool co. v. great lakes plastics inc. 75_f.3d_1568 1574 fed.cir.1996 copying

iron_grip has not made a showing of commercial_success
our cases make clear that a` nexus must be established between the merits of the claimed invention and evidence of commercial_success before that evidence may become relevant to the issue of obviousness'
solder removal co. v. usitc 65_c.c.p.a._120 582_f.2d_628 637 1978
ordinarily this nexus may be inferred when` the patentee shows both that there is commercial_success and that the thing product or method that is commercially successful is the invention disclosed and claimed in the patent'
demaco 851 f.2d at 1392

the only evidence of marketplace success that iron_grip proffers is that six retail competitors offered three-grip_plates and three of those competitors have entered into license agreements with respect to the015_patent
( br
of appellant at 51
iron_grip does not explain the terms of the licenses nor the circumstances under which they were granted except to concede that two were taken in settlement of litigation
( j.a.at 2121-22
our cases specifically require affirmative evidence of nexus where the evidence of commercial_success presented is a license because it is often` cheaper to take licenses than to defend infringement suits'
ewp corp. v. reliance universal inc. 755_f.2d_898 908 fed.cir.1985
thus we held in in re gpac inc. 57_f.3d_1573_(fed.cir.1995) that licenses` may constitute evidence of nonobviousness ; however only little weight can be attributed to such_evidence if the patentee does not demonstrate a nexus between the merits of the invention and the licenses of record'
id.at 1580 internal_quotations and citations omitted
without a showing of nexus` the mere existence of.. licenses is insufficient to overcome the conclusion of obviousness' when there is a strong prima facie case of obviousness
sibia neurosciences inc. v. cadus pharm corp. 225_f.3d_1349 1358 fed.cir.2000
there is no such_evidence of a nexus here ; hence the existence of licenses is of little significance.4

iron_grip places significant emphasis on the fact that before it filed for the015_patent there was no three-grip_plate being offered in the retail market
it argues that the absence of such a three- *1325 grip_plate in light of the prior_art speaks to the nonobviousness of its invention
however iron_grip has presented no evidence of a long-felt need for three-grip_weight_plates or the failure of others
absent a showing of long-felt need or the failure of others the mere passage of time without the claimed invention is not evidence of nonobviousness
see in re wright 569_f.2d_1124 1127 c.c.p.a.1977

iron_grip also argues that usa_sports has copied its invention and this is objective_evidence of nonobviousness
our cases do establish that copying by a competitor may be a relevant consideration in the secondary factor analysis
vandenberg 740 f.2d at 1567
not every competing product that arguably falls within the scope of a patent is evidence of copying
otherwise every infringement suit would automatically confirm the nonobviousness of the patent
rather copying requires the replication of a specific product
this may be demonstrated either through internal documents see akamai techs. inc. v. cable & wireless internet servs. inc. 344_f.3d_1186 1196-97 fed.cir.2003 ; direct evidence such as disassembling a patented prototype photographing its features and using the photograph as a blueprint to build a virtually identical replica see advanced display sys. inc. v. kent state univ. 212_f.3d_1272 1285 fed.cir.2000 ; or access to and substantial similarity to the patented product as opposed to the patent cable elec prods. inc. v. genmark inc. 770_f.2d_1015 1027 fed.cir.1985 overruled on other grounds by midwest indus. inc. v. karavan trailers inc. 175_f.3d_1356 1359 fed.cir.1999 en banc
the evidence of copying offered by iron_grip is that usa_sports abandoned a one-grip_plate and produced a three-grip_plate after the015_patent issued despite receiving assurance from iron_grip that a one-grip_plate would not infringe iron_grips patent
( br
of appellant at 52-53
this does not establish that usa_sports engaged in copying

since iron_grip has not presented evidence of commercial_success satisfaction of a long-felt need or copying we conclude that there is no objective_evidence to rebut the strong showing of obviousness based on the prior_art.5

conclusion
for these reasons the district_courts grant of summary_judgment as to the invalidity of claims 1-big_token__3_and_6__big_token -8 of the015_patent is

affirmed

on appeal iron_grip does not argue that dependant claims 2-big_token__3_and_6__big_token -8 were improperly held to be obvious if the obviousness determination as to claim 1 is sustained

claims 1-big_token__3_and_6__big_token -8
given our disposition it is unnecessary for us to consider the other alleged prior_art submitted by usa_sports
