opinion
pauline newman circuit_judge
dr. roger w. brown appeals the decision of the united_states_district_court for the district of arizona granting summary_judgment of invalidity of dr._browns united_states_patent_no._5852,824.1 we affirm the district_courts judgment

discussion
the district_court ruled summarily that browns patent was anticipated by united_states_patent_no._5600,836 the` tocs' patent for turn of the century systems
for the grant of summary_judgment there must be no material_fact in dispute or no reasonable version of material_fact upon which the nonmovant could prevail
see anderson v. liberty lobby inc. 477_u.s._242 250 106_s.ct._2505 91_l.ed.2d_202_(1986) the purpose of the summary_judgment procedure is not to deprive a litigant of a trial but to avoid an unnecessary trial when there is only one reasonably possible outcome
the grant of summary_judgment of invalidity is reviewed on the same standard as applied by the district_court viz
whether upon application of the correct law a reasonable trier of fact could find for the nonmovant when all reasonably disputed material_facts and factual inferences are resolved in favor of the nonmovant

anticipation under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 means lack of novelty and is a question of fact
to anticipate every element and limitation of the claimed invention must be found in a single prior_art reference arranged as in the claim

when a claim covers several structures or compositions either generically or as alternatives the claim is deemed anticipated if any of the structures or compositions within the scope of the claim is known in the prior_art

the brown and the tocs_patents are both directed to the year 2000 y2k problem
for computer programs where the year 1999 was represented by the two digits` 99' there was concern about whether in the year 2000 the programs would differentiate between the year_dates 2000_and_1900 with forecasts of catastrophic consequences
one proposed solution was to reprogram the computer into thinking it was an earlier year than it actually was so that a year_date ending in` 00' would not soon be reached
the tocs_patent presented a solution of this type wherein` two-digit_years provided as inputs to the application are adjusted by either a time change value or complement value' while the output dates are represented in local time
although it is disputed for the purposes of review of this summary_judgment we accept browns position that the tocs_patent does not teach remediation of other than two-digit_year_dates

*1352 not all computer databases represent the year_date solely by two digits ; some databases use three digits or four digits to represent year_dates especially in newer computer programs
thus several different date formats may be running on the same computer system
the brown invention includes adjustment of programs containing any such date systems

the tocs_patent was licensed to a company called unbeaten path international ltd. upi who provided a program that according to dr._brown remediated year_dates on computers running applications containing two- three- and four-digit_year_dates by setting the computer date clock to an offset_time
dr._brown states that the defendants use this method of remediating year_date_data and that by application to two- three- or four-digit_year_dates the brown_patent is infringed

dr._browns patent filed on may_22,_1997 claims a system for setting the computer_clock to an offset_time applicable to records with year_date_data in` at least one of two-digit three-digit or four-digit' representations
claim 16 is in suit 16
an apparatus for processing year-date_data in a computer system the apparatus comprising a cpu ; a bus coupled to the cpu ; a memory coupled to the bus ; a system_clock coupled to the bus wherein the system_clock is set to an offset_time wherein the offset_time is a time other than the actual time ; at least one application program stored in the memory and being executed by the cpu ; a [ t ] least one database_file stored in the memory containing records with year-date_data with years being represented by at least one of two-digit three-digit or four-digit_year-date_representations ; and
a mechanism for converting the year-date_data_representations in the database_file to a two-digit_year-date_data_representation
( emphasis added
during prosecution dr._brown identified the tocs_patent filed on november 14 1995 as the closest reference

the district_court construed the word` or' in claim 16 as meaning that the apparatus was capable of converting` only two-digit only three-digit only four-digit or any combination of two- three- and four-digit_date-data'
slip op.at 9
we agree with this construction of the claim for it is the plain reading of the claim text
these are not technical terms of art and do not require elaborate interpretation
there is no basis in the specification or prosecution history for reading` or' as` and' -nor does dr._brown request such a reading

neither party disputes that the tocs_patent teaches the handling of year_dates in two-digit format by setting the system_clock to an offset_date other than the actual_date
although dr._brown argues that tocs does not anticipate the larger capability of the brown system to conduct threeand/or four-digit_date conversion the tocs disclosure of two-digit remediation anticipates the brown two-digit rededication
by claiming his invention in the alternative dr._brown has presented a claim for which infringement would lie whether or not there were also offset of three-digit or four-digit_year_dates
the principle of law is concisely embodied in the truism that` that which infringes if later anticipates if earlier'

see generally lewmar marine *1353 inc. v. barient inc. 827_f.2d_744 747 3_uspq2d_1766 1768 fed.cir.1987

dr._brown argues that because the capability to act on a combination of two- three- and four-digit data when such data are present is not shown in the prior_art claim 16 can not be anticipated
however claim 16 is written in the alternative and as written would be literally infringed by a system that offsets year_dates only in two-digit formats such as the tocs system
thus the district_court correctly ruled that claim 16 was anticipated and invalid for lack of novelty

each party shall bear its costs

mayer chief_judge dissenting
i would reverse
the court errs by reading the claim term` or' exclusively while the district_court appropriately read it inclusively when construing the claim
this is not a case of a species anticipating a genus or of a combination claimed in the alternative
instead the brown_patent teaches an apparatus with additional functionality not disclosed in the allegedly anticipating tocs_patent

claim 16 of the brown_patent includes the following limitations at least one database_file stored in the memory containing records with year-date_data with years being represented by at least one of two-digit three-digit or four-digit_year-date_data_representations ; and
a mechanism for converting the year-date_data_representations in the database_file to a two-digit_year-date_data_representation
¡¬824_patent col._18,_ll._59-65

the` mechanism for converting the year-date_data_representations in the database_file' refers to` the' antecedent year-date_data_representations in the prior limitation
such data representations may consist of only two-digit_dates only three-digit_dates only four-digit_dates or any combination or sub-combination thereof
therefore although the data may vary the mechanism always must have the capacity to convert all of the possible data sets into two-digit_year-date_data_representations
moreover the` mechanism for converting..' limitation is stated in means-plus-function format pursuant to 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
6 and must be interpreted by reference to the structure or acts disclosed in the specification
the preferred embodiment in the specification discloses a process for converting all such possible year-date combinations to two-digit representations before further processing to offset the system_clock
see ¡¬824_patent col._12,_l._5- col._13,_l._7
the presence of this disclosure mandates the construction of the` mechanism for converting..' limitation as one that requires the capacity to process two- three- and four-digit_dates even if the full capacity of the device is not always utilized

to invalidate a patent by anticipation a prior_art reference needs to disclose each and every limitation of the claim
standard havens prods. inc. v. gencor indus. inc. 953_f.2d_1360 1369 21_uspq2d_1321 1328 fed.cir.1991
the tocs_patent teaches a mechanism for processing two-digit_year-date_representations by using an offset_date other than an actual_date
however it does not disclose a mechanism for converting three- or four-digit_year-date_representations to two-digit_year-date_representations for use with the offset clock
see e.g. ¡¬836_patent col._9,_ll._50-64 col._10,_ll._38-67 col._2,_ll._42-44
although its specification states that`.. all date_data is preferably converted prior to processing by the application so that the years are confined to a single century' id.at col._4,_ll._18-20 it discloses no acts or structure to perform this conversion and *1354 makes no mention of reducing three- or four-digit_dates to two-digit_dates
therefore the tocs_patent does not anticipate because it does disclose the` mechanism for converting the year-date_data_representations' limitation

similarly the test for literal infringement under ¡± 112 ?
6 is first whether the accused device performs an identical function to the one recited in the claim and if so whether the accused device uses the same structure materials or acts found in the specification or their equivalents
gen. elec co. v. nintendo co. ltd. 179_f.3d_1350 1355 50_uspq2d_1910 1913-14 fed.cir.1999
a system made in accordance with the tocs_patent would not literally infringe the ¡¬824_patent because it would not perform the function of converting three-digit and four-digit_date_representations
therefore because it would not infringe if later it can not anticipate though earlier

moreover the burden of proving a patent anticipated is particularly high when the prior_art was before the examiner during prosecution of the application
hewlett-packard co. v. bausch & lomb inc. 909_f.2d_1464 1467 15_uspq2d_1525 1527 fed.cir.1990
brown cited the tocs_patent as a reference to the examiner in his application for his ¡¬824_patent
had the examiner believed that the brown_patent was claimed in the alternative he would be expected to have imposed a restriction requirement or rejected the application
instead he allowed the claims which use the term` or' in a practical common-sense way of claiming the single invention of an apparatus with multiple inter-related functions
this is not to say that the tocs_patent might not inherently disclose the missing limitation in the brown_patent or that the brown_patent might not be held invalid as obvious or even that brown might be unpatentable as not` useful'
but neither the parties nor the district_court put those questions before us today
