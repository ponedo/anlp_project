background
a
the invention
the patent at issue involves devices known as` bottom sheet feeders' which collate paper and other thin materials for processing in a number of industrial applications including mass mailing printing and binding
see u.s._patent 5,601,282 col._1,_ll._12-23
due to its widespread industrial application bottom sheet feeder technology is a crowded art and is the subject of hundreds of patents
streamfeeder is the assignee of u.s._patent 4,991,831 which is directed to a` paper sheet feeding apparatus and more particularly to an apparatus for serially feeding flat sheets of paper from the bottom of a vertical_stack of such_sheets and so on to permit subsequent processing of each individual sheet'
see831_patent col._1,_ll._5-9
independent_claim 1 the only such claim at issue reads as follows 1
an apparatus for serially feeding sheets in a forward_direction from the bottom of a generally vertical_stack of such_sheets comprising *976 means for supporting the generally vertical_stack of sheets and so that the stack defines a forward_side composed of aligned forward_edges of the sheets and a bottom said supporting means including endless_belt_means and means rotatably mounting said endless_belt_means so as to have an upper_run positioned to extend across the bottom of said stack ; drive means for rotating said endless_belt so that said upper_run_moves in the forward_direction ; and
means including a stationary_gate forming member positioned above said upper_run of said belt_means and adjacent the forward_side of said stack and so as to define a nip which forms a gap between said gate forming member and said upper_run for permitting the lowermost_sheet of the stack to pass forwardly from the stack through said nip said gate forming member including first_surface means facing toward forward_side of said stack so as to engage the forward_edges of the sheets in the stack and second_surface means at said nip and having a coefficient of friction which is higher than that of said first_surface means and such that the lowermost_sheet is free to pass through said nip without significant_frictional_resistance while the sheet immediately above the lowermost_sheet is retarded in moving through said gap by its frictional_engagement with said second_surface means
id.at col._7,_l._48 to col._8,_l._10
dependent claim 2 more particularly claims a sheet feeding apparatus with a` rear_support_member' see id.at col._8,_ll._11-20 and dependent_claim 8 more particularly claims a sheet feeding apparatus with a` sensing means' to monitor paper feeding see id.at ll
42-44
figure 4 of the831_patent depicts the apparatus as follows

*big_token__977_fig._4__big_token
?
the accused device is the commercial embodiment of u.s._patent 5,601,282 which is assigned to sure-feed
this embodiment is shown in figure 1 of the282_patent

*978. ?
fig._1
both devices operate by taking a stack of paper see282_patent fig._1 at 25831_patent fig._4 at s and feeding the bottom-most_sheet forward through the machine by way of` endless_belts' upon which the stack of paper rests see282_patent fig._1 at 20831_patent fig._4 at 30
a` gate' prevents any additional sheets from traveling with the bottom-most_sheet thereby enabling the sheets to be processed one at a time
see282_patent fig._1 at 24831_patent fig._4 at 51
the space between the belt and the gate through which the sheets individually pass is referred to as the` nip'
see282_patent fig._1 not numbered831_patent fig._4 at 52

the equivalency of the gate_element of the accused device and the gate_limitation in the claims is at the center of the dispute between the parties
the circular stationary_gate disclosed in streamfeeders831_patent is depicted in detail in figure 5

*979. ?
fig._5
figure 5 indicates albeit not as clearly as might be desired that the circular gate has two surfaces a surface facing the stack of papers surface 1 and a surface at the nip surface 2
the written description describes the creation of these two surfaces in the following manner [ t ] he gate forming member comprises a generally cylindrical roll 51 [ with ].. a plurality of annular_grooves 58 extending about the circumference thereof.. [ t ] he grooves are relatively deep along a first half of the peripheral_surface of the roll [ surface 1 ] and relatively shallow along a second half of the peripheral_surface [ surface 2 ]..
the roll 51 further includes a [ n ] [ o ] ring 62 disposed in each of the grooves with the rings being composed of a material having a higher coefficient of friction than that of the material of the roll
'831_patent col._4,_ll._42-64
thus the gates grooves within which the o_rings fit are deeper on the side facing the stack of paper such that the o_rings are not exposed
this design creates surface 1 which is simply the acetal metallic or other smooth material of which the gate is constructed
see id.at col._5,_ll._10-11 14-15
surface 1 has a relatively low coefficient of friction £g associated with it thus allowing the sheets in the stack to slide easily downward toward the nip
see id.at col._7,_ll._10-14
at the nip however the grooves are raised exposing the elastomeric or other material of which the o_rings are fabricated
this design creates surface 2 which has a relatively high £g when compared with surface 1
the higher £g value prevents the sheet above the lowermost_sheet from moving through the nip with the lowermost_sheet see id.at col._7,_ll._16-22 i.e. the sheets are prevented from` double-feeding'

in contrast the design of the pivotable gate of sure-feeds device see282_patent fig._1 differs in two main respects from the gate disclosed in the831_patent the sure-feed gate is elliptical and the grooves in which its o_rings fit are of uniform_depth
the282_patent discloses that the elliptical design is meant to enhance the` shingling' of the sheets of paper see id.at col._1,_ll._39-43 whereby the sloping elliptically shaped gate causes the sheets to move in a staggered fashion as they approach the nip each sheet moving slightly further in the direction of feeding than the one above it
see id. fig._1 at 25 *980 illustrating shingling
shingling enhances the separability of sheets as they are fed individually through the nip a process which is particularly advantageous in cases where the sheets being fed are slick
see831_patent col._7,_ll._24-26
as to the gates grooves their uniform_depth exposes the o_rings equally across the surface of the ellipse resulting in a gate with a uniformly high £g on all surfaces that come in contact with the sheets being fed

streamfeeder alleged that in view of the uniformly high about the surface of the elliptical_gate a different factor is responsible for causing the sheets to feed individually in the sure-feed device namely differing normal_forces
normal force n is simply the force applied perpendicular to a surface ; here according to streamfeeder a normal_force is being applied by the elliptical_gate to the sheets of paper with which it comes in contact
more specifically streamfeeder continues the elliptical shape of the gate results in a higher_n being applied by the gates surface at the nip when compared to the surface facing the paper
as a result the sheets move readily down toward the nip but are prevented from double-feeding by the higher_n at the nip

b
the district court
streamfeeder sued sure-feed alleging that sure-feeds device infringes claims 1 2 and 8 of the831_patent under the doctrine of equivalents
literal infringement was not alleged
the parties arguments focused on the accused devices gate_element and specifically on whether that element functioned the same_way as the gate_limitation in the claims at issue
streamfeeder contended that although the claimed gate employs surfaces with different £g values and the accused devices gate employs surfaces with different n values both gates prevent double-feeding in the same_way via surfaces with different_frictional_force_values
streamfeeder based this argument on the equation
f = n £g which relates frictional_force f to normal_force n and coefficient of friction £g
the equation reveals that an increase in either £g or n results in a proportional increase in f. thus streamfeeder argued the equation shows that sure-feeds device which varies n functions in the same_way as the claimed gate which varies £g

sure-feed moved for summary_judgment of noninfringement
focusing its arguments on claim 1 sure-feed asserted inter alia that if the claims were` expanded' under the doctrine of equivalents to read on the accused device they would impermissibly read on the prior_art

citing wilson sporting goods co. v. david geoffrey & associates 904_f.2d_677 14_u.s.p.q.2d_1942_(fed.cir.1990) streamfeeder responded by providing a hypothetical_claim based on claim 1
the court denied sure-feeds motion holding that` streamfeeders hypothetical_claim does notensnare the prior_art and could have been allowed by the pto'

the district_court found that streamfeeders proposed` hypothetical_claim could have been patentable and therefore there is no bar to the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the instant case'

the court further held that a genuine issue of fact existed as to whether the gate_element of the accused device functions in the same_way as the gate_limitation in the claims at issue
see id.at 11

shortly thereafter the court ruled on streamfeeders seven motions in limine ; only motion_no._1 is relevant here
in motion_no._1 streamfeeder sought to exclude 195_of_203 prior_art_patents which were submitted by sure-feed under 35 u.s.c.¡± 282 1994

discussion
a
standards of review
infringement analysis is a two-step process
the first step is claim construction which involves ascertaining the scope and meaning of the claims at issue while the second step involves determining whether the claims as construed read on the accused device
see personalized media communications l.l.c
v. international trade comm n 161_f.3d_696 702 48_u.s.p.q.2d_1880 1885 fed.cir.1998
claim construction is a question of law while infringement either literal or under the doctrine of equivalents is a question of fact
see bai v. l & l wings inc. 160_f.3d_1350 1353 48_u.s.p.q.2d_1674 1676 fed.cir.1998
`` hypothetical_claim_analysis' is a methodology that may facilitate the determination whether an asserted scope of equivalents is permissible in view of the prior_art
see wilson 904 f.2d at 677 14 u.s.p.q.2d at 1942
determining whether the scope of equivalents accorded to a particular_claim would encompass the prior_art is an issue of law which we review de novo
see id.at 683 904_f.2d_677 14 u.s.p.q.2d at 1948

b
the doctrine of equivalents and hypothetical claim analysis
sure-feed argues that the court erred in adopting streamfeeders hypothetical_claim because the scope of equivalents sought by streamfeeder is prohibited by the prior_art
streamfeeder responds that sure-feed never asked the court to enter jmol on this ground thereby waiving this argument
streamfeeder contends that even if this argument was not waived sure-feed failed to carry its burden of showing that the scope of equivalents is prohibited by the prior_art by merely showing that one of the limitations of the hypothetical_claim is in the prior_art
sure-feed replies that the burden is on the patentee to show that its asserted range of equivalents does not cover the prior_art
moreover sure-feed argues that streamfeeder improperly` expanded' one limitation and` narrowed' another limitation in constructing its hypothetical_claim.1 we agree with sure-feed that the court erred in adopting streamfeeders hypothetical_claim and we further conclude that a legally-acceptable hypothetical_claim that would encompass sure-feeds device would read on the prior_art

in wilson we set forth a hypothetical_claim methodology to aid in determining whether a particular_claim may be infringed under the doctrine of equivalents
see wilson 904 f.2d at 684 14 u.s.p.q.2d at 1948 ; see also key mfg group inc. v. microdot inc. 925_f.2d_1444 1449 17_u.s.p.q.2d_1806 1810 fed.cir.1991
under that methodology the patentee may propose a hypothetical_claim which is broad enough in scope to literally read on the accused device
see wilson 904 f.2d at 684 14 u.s.p.q.2d at 1948
if *982 the hypothetical_claim could have been allowed by the patent and trademark office pto in view of the prior_art then the prior_art does not preclude the application of the doctrine of equivalents and infringement may be found
see id
on the other hand as in the ptos examination_process references may be combined to prove that the hypothetical_claim would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art and thus would not have been allowed
see key mfg. 925 f.2d at 1449 17 u.s.p.q.2d at 1810

following the direction of wilson streamfeeder presented the district_court with a hypothetical_claim in response to sure-feeds motion for summary_judgment of noninfringement
that claim hypothetical_claim 1 is a modified version of original_claim 1 with additions indicated by underlining and deletions indicated by brackets 1
an apparatus for serially feeding sheets in a forward_direction from the bottom of a generally vertical_stack of such_sheets comprising means for supporting the generally vertical_stack of sheets and so that the stack defines a forward_side composed of aligned forward_edges of the sheets and a bottom said supporting means including endless_belt_means and means rotatably mounting said endless_belt_means so as to have an upper_run positioned to extend across the bottom of said stack ; drive means for rotating said endless_belt so that said upper_run_moves in the forward_direction ; and
means including a stationary_gate forming member positioned above said upper_run of said belt_means and adjacent the forward_side of said stack and so as to define a nip which forms a gap between said gate forming member and said upper_run for permitting the lowermost_sheet of the stack to pass forwardly from the stack through said nip said gate forming member comprising a cylindrical_member having a plurality of annular_grooves formed inwardly from a periphery thereof at regularly spaced intervals and with elastomeric_bands disposed in said annular_grooves and including first_surface means facing toward forward_side of said stack so as to engage the forward_edges of the sheets in the stack and second_surface means at said nip [ and having a coefficient of friction which is higher than that of said first_surface means ] said plurality of elastomeric_bands and said cylindrical_member being arranged to present higher frictional resistance to the forward_edges of the sheets at said second_surface means than at said first_surface means and such that the lowermost_sheet is free to pass through said nip without significant_frictional_resistance while the sheet immediately above the lowermost_sheet is retarded in moving through said gap by its frictional_engagement with said second_surface means

j. at 30
streamfeeders hypothetical_claim is nearly identical to original_claim 1 except for two differences first the gate_limitation has been narrowed to consist specifically of a cylindrical_member containing elastomeric_bands and second the limitation requiring two surfaces with two different coefficient of friction values has been broadened to recite two surfaces with two different_frictional_force_values
sure-feed contends that by simultaneously broadening one limitation of original_claim 1 and narrowing another streamfeeder has in effect` rewritten' the claim

before proceeding further with the merits of the hypothetical_claim_analysis we must first address the procedural question as to which party bears the burden of proving whether the hypothetical_claim does or does not read on the prior_art
citing national_presto industries inc. v. west bend co. streamfeeder contends that the burden rested on sure-feed to prove that the claim reads on the prior_art
see national_presto indus. inc. v. west *983 bend co. 76_f.3d_1185 1192 37_u.s.p.q.2d_1685 1689 fed.cir.1996
in national_presto we stated when the patentee has made a prima facie case of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents the burden of coming forward with evidence to show that the accused device is in the prior_art is upon the accused infringer not the trial judge
national_presto 76 f.3d at 1192 37 u.s.p.q.2d at 1689
streamfeeders reliance on national_presto is misplaced however because while the burden of going forward rests with the accused infringer the burden of persuasion that the hypothetical_claim does not ensnare the prior_art remains with the patentee in this context it is important to remember that the burden is on wilson [ the patentee ] to prove that the range of equivalents which it seeks would not ensnare the prior_art..
the patent owner has always borne the burden of proving infringement see under sea indus. inc. v. dacor corp. 833_f.2d_1551 1557 4_u.s.p.q.2d_1772 1776 fed.cir.1987 and there is no logical reason why that burden should shift to the accused infringer simply because infringement in this context might require inquiry into the patentability of a hypothetical_claim
any other approach would ignore the realities of what happens in the pto and violate established patent law
wilson 904 f.2d at 685 14_u.s.p.q.2d_1948 -49
thus after the accused infringer satisfies its burden of going forward here by presenting prior_art which shows that the asserted range of equivalence would encompass the prior_art wilson indicates that` the burden to prove' i.e. the burden of persuasion rests on the patentee to show that its claim does not cover the prior_art

turning to the merits we agree with sure-feed and conclude that the district_court erred as a matter of law in adopting streamfeeders hypothetical_claim because such a claim impermissibly narrowed the gate member limitation
a hypothetical_claim_analysis is not an opportunity to freely redraft granted claims
that opportunity existed in the pto where the submitted claims were examined for patentability
other statutorily prescribed procedures exist for post-grant modification of claims in the pto in appropriate circumstances
see e.g. 35 u.s.c.¡± 252 1994 reissue ; 35 u.s.c.¡± 307 1994 reexamination
while use of a hypothetical_claim may permit a minor extension of a claim to cover subject_matter that is substantially equivalent to that literally claimed one can not in the course of litigation and outside of the pto cut and trim expanding here and narrowing there to arrive at a claim that encompasses an accused device but avoids the prior_art
slight broadening is permitted at that point but not narrowing
see jurgens v. mckasy 927_f.2d_1552 1561 18_u.s.p.q.2d_1031 1038 fed.cir.1991` [ i ] t may be helpful toconceptualize the prior_art limitation on the doctrine of equivalents by envisioning a hypothetical patent claim-similar to the asserted claim but broad enough to literally cover the accused products-and testing whether that claim would have been patentable in view of the prior_art'
( emphasis added
wholesale redrafting of granted claims during litigation by narrowing and expanding the claims at the same_time in creating a hypothetical_claim is not supported by our case law and it avoids the examination_process
it is contrary to the statutory requirement that an applicant` particularly point [ ] out and distinctly claim [ ] the subject_matter which the applicant regards as his [ or her ] invention' 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 1994 a requirement that presupposes a pto examination which does not occur with a hypothetical_claim
hypothetical_claim_analysis thus can not be used to redraft granted claims in litigation by narrowing and broadening a claim at the same_time

when one considers a permissible_hypothetical_claim in this case i.e. streamfeeders hypothetical_claim without the narrowed limitation it is clear that the *984 hypothetical_claim reads on the prior_art ; streamfeeder failed to satisfy its ultimate burden of persuasion to the contrary.2 sure-feed satisfied its burden of coming forward with evidence that the hypothetical_claim reads on the prior_art by presenting a number of prior_art_patents
u.s._patent 4,715,593 godlewski in view of u.s._patent 4,606,535 larson are the key patents and we are satisfied that these references are sufficiently important i.e. significant to the bottom sheet feeder art that those skilled in that art would have been motivated to combine them see in re rouffet 149_f.3d_1350 1355-56 47_u.s.p.q.2d_1453 1456 fed.cir.1998 stating that motivation to combine references may come from` the ordinary knowledge of those skilled in the art that certain references are of special importance in a particular field
``

sure-feed correctly observes that streamfeeder conceded that godlewski contains all of the limitations of original_claim 1 except for the` endless_belt_means' and the` second_surface means at said nip.. having a coefficient of friction that is higher than that of said first_surface means'
see streamfeeder resp
br.at 14-15
the endless_belt_means however is clearly disclosed in larson
see535_patent col._3,_l._65
as to the` second_surface means at said nip.. having a coefficient of friction that is higher than that of said first_surface means' limitation this was broadened in the hypothetical_claim by essentially replacing` coefficient of friction' with` frictional resistance' i.e. frictional_force
this broadening encompasses larson which discloses a gate containing two surfaces which vary in normal_force
see id.at ll
40-50
thus sure-feed successfully carried its burden of going forward by providing prior_art which by disclosing all of the limitations of the hypothetical_claim would have rendered it unpatentable
streamfeeder in contrast failed to carry its burden of persuasion simply arguing in various ways that sure-feed failed to carry its burden

as a final matter we must address whether to affirm the judgment with respect to dependent_claims 2_and_8 on the ground that sure-feed failed to argue noninfringement of those claims in its briefing before this court or in its motion for summary_judgment
sure-feed perhaps chose that strategy based on the axiomatic principle that if an accused infringer does not infringe an independent_claim it can not infringe claims that depend on that independent_claim
see wahpeton canvas co. inc. v. frontier inc. 870_f.2d_1546 1552_n._9 10_u.s.p.q.2d_1201 1208_n._9_(fed.cir.1989)
streamfeeder agreed stating in its summary_judgment response` streamfeeder contends that dependent_claims 5 8 9 and 11 [ sic issued claims 2_and_8 ] are infringed but agrees that defendants motion stands or falls based on whether a reasonable jury could find that claim 1 is infringed'
see streamfeeders mem
of law in opp n to def
's mot
for summ
j. at 8_n._3
thus the parties staked the outcome regarding the dependent_claims on the outcome of claim 1

in wilson we noted a narrow counterintuitive exception to the general principle that when one does not infringe a broader *985 claim one can not infringe a dependent_claim containing all of that broader claims limitations plus more while this proposition is no doubt generally correct it does not apply in the circumstances of this case
here we have reversed the judgment of infringement of independent_claim 1 solely because the asserted range of equivalents of the claim limitations would encompass the prior_art uniroyal ball
the dependent_claims of course are narrower than claim 1 ; therefore it does not automatically follow that the ranges of equivalents of these narrower claims would encompass the prior_art because of their added limitations
wilson 904 f.2d at 686 14 u.s.p.q.2d at 1949
because streamfeeder acknowledged in the district_court that the dependent_claims stand or fall with claim 1 streamfeeder can not now seek to sustain the judgment on claims 2_and_8 alone on the basis of that exception.3 we therefore reverse the judgment of infringement of claims 1 2 and 8

conclusion
the district_court erred in adopting the jurys finding of infringement of claim 1 since the hypothetical_claim proposed by streamfeeder encompassing the accused device would not have been patentable over the godlewski patent in view of the larson patent
furthermore streamfeeder can not seek to sustain judgment as to claims 2_and_8 because it previously argued that these claims stand or fall with claim 1
in view of these conclusions we need not review the denial of sure-feeds jmol/new_trial_motion
accordingly we

reverse

in wilson we observed that the doctrine of equivalents does not` expand' or` broaden' claims but instead expands the right to exclude
see wilson 904 f.2d at 684 14 u.s.p.q.2d at 1948
for convenience however we will utilize these terms cognizant of the fact that it is the right to exclude which is being expanded not the claims
2
streamfeeder urges that sure-feed raised its argument that the hypothetical_claim encroaches upon the prior_art only in its summary_judgment_motion but not in its jmol_motion and that accordingly this argument was waived
we do not agree
because this is a procedural issue which is not unique to patent law we must apply the law of the regional circuit in which the district_court sits
see engel indus. inc. v. lockformer co. 166_f.3d_1379 1384 49_u.s.p.q.2d_1618 1622 fed.cir.1999
under eighth circuit law streamfeeders argument is clearly without merit
sure-feed raised this issue of law prior to the case going to the jury so it was therefore unnecessary for it to have been raised subsequently in its jmol_motion
see porous media corp. v. pall corp. 110_f.3d_1329 1338_n._12_(8th_cir.1997)` [ t ] his legal question.. was preserved for appeal because it was argued to the district_court before the case was submitted to the jury'
( citing bottineau farmers elevator v. woodward-clyde consultants 963_f.2d_1064 1073 8th cir.1992 holding that issue of law raised in summary_judgment_motion was preserved for appeal despite not being reasserted in motions for directed verdict or jnov
3
moreover we note that even if streamfeeder had asserted hypothetical_claims for claims 2_and_8 sure-feed would almost certainly have prevailed
the` rear_support_member' limitation of claim 2 is disclosed as a` retainer bar' in u.s._patent 3,908,983 see983_patent col._2,_ll._34-49 and the sensor limitation in claim 11 is disclosed in larson see535_patent col._5,_ll._17-26
