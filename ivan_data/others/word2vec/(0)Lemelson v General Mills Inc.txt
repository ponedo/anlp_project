plager circuit_judge
this is a patent infringement suit by jerome h. lemelson alleging infringement by mattelshot_wheels toy
over $ 70,000,000 in damages and interest was awarded mr. lemelson lemelson
defendant mattel inc. mattel appeals from the judgment entered after a jury trial by the united_states_district_court for the northern_district of illinois eastern division dated may_8,_19901 the district_court pursuant to jury_verdict adjudged mattel to have infringed claim 3 of lemelsons reissue_patent re

background
a
the claimed invention involved in this case relates to a flexible track upon which toy cars run
mattelshot_wheels the first major commercialization of such a toy became one of the most commercially successful_toys in history

lemelsons original patent application for a` toy_track' was filed in the u.s. patent and trademark office pto on may_14,_1967 with one independent_claim and eight dependent_claims
that original independent_claim reproduced below consisted of what would later become the first five of the seven clauses in claim 3 of the reissue_patent2

a trackway toy comprising in combination with a toy_vehicle having plural_wheels a a trackway including a base having an upper_surface along which said vehicle may travel b guide_means for defining a path of travel for said vehicle on said upper_surface c said guide_means including at least one formation molded integral with said upper_surface of said trackway and providing plural_parallel extending surfaces against which respective_wheels of said vehicle may ride to define said path in travel_therealong d said base and said guide_means being integrally molded of flexible_plastic_material and having the characteristic such that said base is normally incapable of self-support whereby said trackway will easily conform to non-planar surfaces and
( e rigid_support_means for said trackway disposed adjacent said base and engaging a surface thereof in a manner to predetermine the shape of the base
during prosecution of the 1967 application lemelsons counsel cited to the pto several patents found in a prior_art_search including the gardiol_patent u.s. patent no._2862,333
lemelsons counsel described gardiol as a track construction which includes internal wires to maintain its desired shape while lemelsons application was said to be directed to a flexible plastic track which was` normally incapable of self-support so that the trackway could be made to readily conform to non-planar surfaces'

the examiner rejected independent_claim 1 and three of its dependent_claims as being anticipated by gardiol
the remaining five dependent_claims which added further limitations were allowed subject to being written in independent_form
subsequent to a personal interview with the examiner lemelsons counsel filed an amendment which re-wrote the allowed claims in independent_form and cancelled the rejected claims

the application was later allowed and issued as u.s. patent no._3451,161 the161_patent on june_24,_1969
the patent` toy_track and vehicle therefor' is directed to a` toy guideway or track and vehicle for riding thereover'
claim 3 of the161_patent as rewritten which is the same as claim 3 of the reissue_patent3 reads

3
a trackway [ toy ] comprising in combination with a toy_vehicle having plural_wheels [ a ] a trackway including a base having an upper_surface along which said vehicle may travel [ b ] guide_means for defining a path of travel for said vehicle on said upper_surface [ c ] said guide_means including at least one formation molded integrally with said upper_surface of said trackway *1204 and providing plural_parallel extending surfaces against which respective_wheels of said vehicle may ride to define said path of travel_therealong [ d ] said base and said guide_means being integrally molded of flexible_plastic_material and having the characteristic such that said base is normally incapable of self-support whereby said trackway will easily conform to non-planar surfaces and
[ e ] rigid_support_means for said trackway disposed adjacent said base and engaging a surface thereof in a manner to predetermine the shape of the base [ f ] said guide_means include a pair of spaced apart_runner_portions for defining the pathway of a vehicle moving over said track [ g ] said spaced apart_runner_portions include upwardly extending rails for guiding the wheels of a vehicle
( the bracketed lettering before each clause has been added for convenience in referencing
a comparison of original cancelled claim 1 and what is now reissue_claim 3 shows that the first five clauses- [ a ] through [ e ] -of original cancelled claim 1 are identical to the first five clauses of reissue_claim 3
as we shall discuss it was the addition of the final two clauses- [ f ] and [ g ] -that overcame the problem of anticipation by gardiol and upon the meaning of which this case turns

b
returning to the sequence of events by 1967 mattel started independent development of a track and car product for entry into the market for small metal cars such as the popularmatchbox cars
during the preliminary stages of development of the hot_wheels_cars and track_system max e. shirk mattels outside counsel had a prior_art_search done covering a number of the tracks features
the search was directed to novelty and state-of-the-art

in a letter dated october 6 1967 shirk reported that twenty-six prior_art patents were found including gardiol
( lemelsons patent had not yet issued and was therefore not found in this search
gardiol was described as disclosing a` deformable toy_track' made from a` flexible_plastic_material' which was` capable of undergoing a three-dimensional_deformation'
shirk concluded that in light of the prior_art only` a few relatively small features [ of the mattel track and its accessory items ] may be patentable'
two of these features stemmed directly from the track 1 thedishing of the juncture of the upstanding side walls with the upper_surface of the track in order to minimize contact of the car wheels with the side walls and 2 the use of continuous parallel channels on the lower surface of the track for use in connecting consecutive track sections
mattel subsequently obtained a number of patents covering various specific technical features of the hot_wheels system but did not apply for a patent covering the track itself

mattel introduced the hot_wheels_cars and track_system at the february 1968 toy fair
the hot_wheels products were a hit and as noted became one of the most popular and commercially successful_toys in united states history

lemelson conceded that he knew about hot_wheels at least by late 1968-the year before his patent issued
his first contact with mattel regarding a license under the161_patent was in september of 1970 more than a year after the patent issued
despite lemelsons repeated efforts over a period of time mattel steadfastly denied any interest in such a license
at one point lemelson told mattel that he was considering legal action for patent infringement
he also told mattel that he was` extremely busy' in other patent litigations and in his business activities` relating to patent licensing' but that he would` eventually' get around to suing mattel

lemelson testified that he subsequently began to` look around for what would be.. a good attorney to handle a litigation against mattel'
he eventually contacted an attorney carl pearson after reading about him in the new york times
it was not until late 1977 that lemelson and pearson *1205 came to an agreement and the litigation was ready

lemelson filed suit in the northern_district of illinois in december 1977 claiming that mattels hot_wheels toys infringed the161_patent
lemelson filed his reissue_application on december 16 1980 in light of prior_art cited by mattel in the course of the litigation
in january 1983 mattel consented to a stay of the litigation pending disposition of the reissue
mattel participated in the reissue_proceedings to the fullest extent permitted by the pto rules
the examiner and later the pto_board of appeals ultimately denied the reissue_application despite amendments which changed several of the claims and added others on the grounds that the claimed inventions would have been obvious in view of various combinations of prior_art including gardiol

c. lemelson then brought an action in the district_court for the district of columbia under 35 u.s.c.¡± 145 challenging the pto decision
that court concluded that the invention of the rejected claims would not have been obvious and held that the reissue_application should be granted
lemelson v. mossinghoff 225_uspq_1063 1985_wl_1787_(d.d.c.1985)
the district_court relied in part on evidence of the` commercial success of the highly flexible hot_wheels_trackway toy_vehicle combination covered by [ lemelsons ] reissue application'
lemelson 225 uspq at 1067
the pto commissioner filed but then abandoned an appeal to this court and the reissue_patent issued april_8,_1986
throughout the reissue_proceedings claim 3 remained unchanged

d. the infringement suit in the northern_district of illinois was reactivated and went to trial in october 1989
pursuant to mattels motion in limine which was granted by the district_court the jury was apprised only of conclusory facts regarding the outcome of the reissue_proceedings-the details were not disclosed due to the potential for excessive prejudice against mattel who was not a party to the reissue suit outweighing the relevance of the proceedings

at the close of lemelsons case mattel filed a motion for directed verdict on the grounds that 1 the prosecution_history prevented a claim scope construction which could support lemelsons assertion of infringement ; 2 lemelson failed as a matter of law to prove infringement ; 3 the patent was invalid as anticipated under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b ; and 4 the doctrines of laches and estoppel barred lemelsons suit against mattel
at the close of all evidence mattel filed another motion for directed verdict which renewed the earlier motion and added grounds further asserting invalidity due to 5 anticipation of the claimed invention by gardiol ; 6 obviousness of the claimed invention in view of the prior_art ; and 7 failure to comply with 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 demonstrated by a lack of having distinctly claimed the subject_matter which lemelson regarded as his invention
the district_court delayed deciding these motions until after the trial concluded

the jury answered the following interrogatories posed by the trial_court 1 does defendant mattels trackway_system contain each and every element of claim 3 of plaintiff lemelsons patent ?
[ yes ] ; 1a is each element of claim 3 or its substantial equivalent found in mattels trackway_system ?
[ yes ] ; 2 did defendant willfully infringe claim 3 of plaintiffs patent ?
[ yes ] ; 3 does the italian gardiol_patent no._511980 disclose all of the elements of claim 3 of plaintiffs patent ?
[ no ] ; 4 would the subject_matter of claim 3 of plaintiffs patent have been obvious in may 1967 to a person having ordinary skill in the art of toy_track and car manufacture ?
[ no ] ; 5 was the subject_matter of claim 3 of plaintiffs patent on sale prior to may_4,_1966 ?
[ no ] ; *1206 6 was the subject_matter of claim 3 of plaintiffs patent described in a printed publication prior to may_4,_1966 ?
[ no ] ; 7 was the subject_matter of claim 3 clearly and distinctly claimed by plaintiff ?
[ yes ]
the same jury in the second part of the bifurcated proceedings awarded damages of $ 24,780,000

the district_court then denied mattels motions for directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict or for a new_trial and entered judgment for lemelson
the district_court also granted lemelsons motion for prejudgment_interest using the prime_rate compounded quarterly and without accounting for any tax-effects to add $ 46,476,690 in interest for a total award of $ 71,256,690
the district_court denied lemelsons motion for increased damages or attorney fees

mattel in appealing to this court raises the following issues for review 1 the courts construction of and instructions to the jury regarding the scope of lemelsons claim in light of the prosecution_history generally and in light of the gardiol_patent specifically ; 2 the laches defense ; 3 invalidity of the patent claim for indefiniteness under 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 1988 as a matter of law ; and 4 calculation of prejudgment_interest at the prime_rate compounded quarterly without regard for tax effects
we need address only the first of these issues in order to decide this appeal

discussion
a
it is elementary in patent law that in determining whether a patent is valid and if valid infringed the first_step is to determine the meaning and scope of each claim in suit.4 while there may be underlying fact questions involved the ultimate conclusion about the meaning and scope of a claim is like contract interpretation a question of law
once the claims are properly understood a determination can be made whether a particular claimreads on the accused structure or process

in determining the meaning of a claim it is necessary to examine closely the language of the claim the specification and the prosecution_history
see e.g. fromson v. advance offset plate inc. 720_f.2d_1565 1569-71 219_uspq_1137 1140-42 fed.cir.1983
this is particularly true if as is often the case a dispute exists as to how language of the claim should be interpreted and the claim as a whole construed
the prosecution_history gives insight into what the applicant originally claimed as the invention and often what the applicant gave up in order to meet the examiners objections
prosecution history is especially important when the invention involves a crowded art field or when there is particular prior_art that the applicant is trying to distinguish

thus the determination of the scope of the claim-its interpretation and proper construction-while denominated a question of law is in many cases based on the facts regarding the patents history
when these matters are placed before a trial_judge for decision-a trier of fact who is also a law-giver-the sequence of decision-making is easy to maintain
but when a question of infringement is given to a jury there is a special burden placed on the trial_judge-as well as the parties-to ensure that the second step in the process that of comparing the claims to the accused product or process does not cause the first_step interpreting the claims properly to get short shrift
the underlying factual issues in dispute become the jurys province to resolve in the course of rendering its verdict on infringement
see e.g. tol-o-matic inc. v. proma produkt-und marketing gesellschaft m.b.h. 945_f.2d_1546 1549-50 20_uspq2d_1332 1335-36 fed.cir.1991
if challenged the jurys determination is reviewed according to the generally established rules for review of jury_verdicts first by the trial_court on *1207 motion for jnov and by then this court on appeal

b
the standard of review for this court when reviewing a trial_judges denial of a motion for jnov requires us to decide for ourselves whether reasonable jurors viewing the evidence as a whole could have found the facts needed to support the verdict in light of the applicable_law
if we conclude that no reasonable findings of fact supported by substantial_evidence could support the verdict that was incorporated into the trial_courts judgment then we must conclude that the trial_court erred in not granting the motion for jnov

1991 & supp.1991-92

in the present case the jury was adequately instructed to consider and decide the factual questions necessary to interpret the scope of the claims before deciding the issue of infringement
the instructions included a specific direction to consider the prosecution_history of the patent and to` exclude any interpretation that may have been disclaimed or given up during prosecution in order to obtain the allowance of the claim'
finding no problem with the jury instructions we are left to consider whether substantial_evidence in light of the applicable_law supports the jurys verdict

c. the first five clauses in claim 3 see supra p. 1203 comprised a separate claim which had been rejected by the examiner as anticipated by gardiol see supra pp
1203-1204
lemelson abandoned that 5-clause_claim and accepted the issuance of a claim comprised of the 5-clause_claim supplemented with two additional_clauses
it was that supplemented claim that issued and later reissued as claim 3

1
the prosecution history and the prior art
gardiol discloses a sectional toy_track having longitudinal cores within sidewalls to allow sequential engagement on which a toy_vehicle can freely move
gardiols specification describes the track as being readily shaped and set in any desired form as allowed by the cores with the lateral_movement of a toy_vehicle riding along the track being limited by the upwardly extended sidewalls

the pto at different times concluded that lemelsons claim 3 the original cancelled claim with the added two clauses was patentably distinguishable from the prior_art the original examiner and was not patentably distinguishable and was therefore invalid for obviousness the reissue examiner affirmed by the pto_board
despite its internal disagreement regarding the claim as supplemented the pto was consistent on one point-at no time did the pto conclude that the five clauses in the original claim which are the first five of the seven clauses of claim 3 patentably distinguish lemelsons invention from the prior_art

lemelson on the other hand takes the position in his brief on appeal to this court that the supplemental clauses-clauses [ f ] and [ g ] -do nothing to distinguish gardiol and the other_prior_art
he argues that the distinctions between claim 3 and the prior_art occur in the limitations described in the first five clauses of claim 3
lemelson justifies this position by suggesting that the examiners rejection of the five-clause_claim as anticipated by gardiol simply` did not make sense
patent examiners like the rest of us occasionally make mistakes'

this argument is without merit
during prosecution of the original patent lemelson cancelled the five-clause_claim in face of the examiners rejection and submitted for allowance the claim with the additional_clauses as suggested by the examiner
lemelson can not acquiesce to a rejection and to an agreed alternative and now *1208 years later shift his stance 180¢X to argue for a second bite at the abandoned apple
other players in the marketplace are entitled to rely on the record made in the patent office in determining the meaning and scope of the patent

the question of whether the original five-clause_claim was patentable over gardiol and the other_prior_art is thus foreclosed.5 if reissue_claim 3 is distinguishable at all from the prior_art it must be because of something in the added two clauses
the evidence adduced at trial would not allow a reasonable_jury to read the prosecution_history and the specification any other way

2
hot_wheels and infringement
the evidence at trial demonstrated that the hot_wheels_track is basically the same as gardiol but without the internal support
hot_wheels uses external attachments as does lemelson to define the shape of the track for any particular configuration
however there is no evidence of any other significant difference between hot_wheels and gardiol
both have an upper_surface for supporting a movable_object
both are capable of undergoing three-dimensional_deformation
both have longitudinal sides which limit the lateral_movement of the movable_object
the evidence at bar pointed to nothing in the hot_wheels_track which is not found in gardiol
gardiol differs only in having an extra element-the internal core for structural support

in arguing at trial that the claims of his patentread on the accused device lemelson failed to demonstrate that the hot_wheels_track included each claim limitation or its equivalent
the testimony on the point contributed nothing of substance to the language of the claims e.g. lemelson testified that clause [ f ]` adds something to the earlier phrases of the claim and that is that the guide_means includes a pair of spaced apart_runner_portions for defining the pathway of a vehicle moving over the track' and that clause [ g ]` adds some language to the preceding phrases of the claim by saying that thespaced apart_runner_portions include upwardly extending rails
``

as discussed supra the jury if its verdict regarding infringement is to be sustained must have interpreted clauses [ f ] and [ g ] to add something to the claim not found in the first five clauses and that is found in hot_wheels ; and if its verdict regarding validity is to be sustained that something must not be disclosed by gardiol
but there is no substantive evidence to distinguish hot_wheels from gardiol ; lemelson identified no elements in the hot_wheels_track that correspond to limitations [ f ] and [ g ]
absent sufficient evidence in the record to support the conclusion that hot_wheels is distinguishable from gardiol it follows that hot_wheels could not be found to meet all of the limitations contained in the lemelson patent either literally or by equivalents

we therefore conclude that no reasonable_jury could read reissue_claim 3 both to be valid in view of gardiol and infringed by hot_wheels
when properly placed in the context of the prosecution_history and the demonstrated meaning of the several clauses of the claim these are inherently inconsistent conclusions
to the extent the jury so concluded there was error and the trial_court should have granted the motion for jnov as to the finding of infringement.6

see claim 3 infra p. 1203

in the reissue_claim 3 the preamble reads` a trackway comprising' rather than` a trackway toy comprising'
the deletion of` toy' appears from the record of the proceedings before the pto to have been an inadvertent error when the patent was printed rather than an amendment to the claim
4
just as elementary the same interpretation of a claim must be applied to all validity and infringement issues in the case
see e.g. w.l
gore & associates inc. v. garlock inc. 842_f.2d_1275 1279 6_uspq2d_1277 1280-81 fed.cir.1988

insta-foam products inc. v. universal foam systems inc. 906_f.2d_698 15_uspq2d_1295_(fed.cir.1990) cited by lemelson in his brief is inapplicable to the facts of the instant case
in insta-foam this court upheld the district courts holding that the mere acceptance and rewriting of an allowed dependent claim in independent_form did not establish prosecution_history estoppel in that case
906 f.2d at 703-04 15 uspq2d at 1298-99
however the question there was not whether the abandoned broader claim was nevertheless patentable as lemelson argues here but whether for purposes of determining infringement under the doctrine of equivalents the abandonment evidenced intent regarding a limitation which was already in the claim before the amendment and which was not disclosed by the prior_art at issue

due to the posture of the case on appeal the question of whether the patent is valid even though not infringed is not before us
