gajarsa circuit_judge
appellant rheox inc.` rheox' the plaintiff in this patent infringement case appeals from the district_courts grant of summary_judgment for the appellees entact inc.` entact'
we affirm the district_courts grant of summary_judgment of non-infringement because we conclude that rheox is precluded from asserting that the claim_term` calcium_orthophosphate' covers monocalcium_orthophosphate and triple_superphosphate

background
rheox is the assignee of u.s. patent no._5162,600` the ¡¬600_patent`
the ¡¬600_patent is directed to an inexpensive_method of remediating lead from lead-contaminated soil by application of a composition primarily comprising` calcium_orthophosphate'
claim_construction of the term` calcium_orthophosphate' is the textual determinative issue in this case
rheox asserts that the district_court incorrectly construed the claim_term` calcium_orthophosphate' to be limited to tricalcium_orthophosphate ca3 po4 2 and improperly determined that rheox disclaimed monocalcium_orthophosphate ca h2po4 2h2o *1321 and triple_superphosphate` tsp' which the parties agree consists mostly of monocalcium_orthophosphate ca h2po4 2 h2o from the scope of its claims

a phosphate is a chemical compound that contains phosphorous p and oxygen o
an orthophosphate contains a po43 anion.1 the parties agree and the district_court recognized that the terms` phosphate' and` orthophosphate' are used interchangeably in the art
although in dispute it seems clear that a person of ordinary_skill in the relevant art would recognize that` calcium_orthophosphate' generally refers to a family of compounds each of which contains a calcium cation 2_ca_2 - and a phosphate anion po43-
under this definition there are multiple calcium_orthophosphates including monocalcium_orthophosphate and tricalcium_orthophosphate

on december 28 1990 rheox filed a patent_application which eventually issued as the ¡¬600_patent
the application as originally filed contained eighteen claims some using calcium_orthophosphate as the primary treating agent and others using monocalcium_orthophosphate and tsp_fertilizer
the relevant claims as originally filed with the patent and trademark_office` pto' provided 1
a method of treating lead contaminated soil to reduce the amount of mobile_lead contained in said soil the method which comprises a providing an agent selected from the group consisting of calcium zinc magnesium or ammonium_phosphate_compounds calcium zinc magnesium or ammonium phosphite compounds and mixtures thereof ; and
( b contacting said agent with said soil to react said agent with mobile_lead contained in the soil and form immobilized water-insoluble_lead_compounds
2
the method of claim 1 wherein said agent comprises a calcium phosphate fertilizer selected from the group consisting of triple_superphosphate [ tsp ] and superphosphate
3
the method of claim 1 wherein said calcium magnesium zinc or ammonium_phosphate_compounds are selected from the group consisting of calcium_orthophosphate.. dicalcium_orthophosphate.. monocalcium_orthophosphate.. tricalcium_diorthophosphate
... 18
a method of treating lead contaminated soil to reduce the amount of mobile_lead contained in said soil the method which comprises a providing an agent selected from the group consisting of triple_superphosphate [ tsp ] phosphate rock hydroxyapatite and mixtures thereof ;.. emphasis added

the written description of the ¡¬600_patent does not explicitly define calcium_orthophosphate
in both the summary of the invention and in the detailed description of the invention however the ¡¬600_patent provides that tsp is one of the preferred agents for use in the patented invention

*1322 in the first office action the pto rejected all eighteen claims
the pto first indicated that fertilizers tsp is a fertilizer are well known in the art and it would have been obvious to one of ordinary_skill to treat lead-contaminated soil with fertilizer
the pto then rejected the claims as obvious over u.s. patent no._4737,356` the o'hara_patent'3 which explains the use of phosphate to fix lead in particulate solids

following rheoxs submission of a supplemental information disclosure statement the pto issued a final_office_action rejecting each of rheoxs 18 claims
the examiner explained that o'hara taught use of water-soluble phosphate treatment agents
in the final_rejection the examiner stated it is also well known to one of ordinary_skill in the art that monocalcium_phosphate is water soluble and is routinely available as.. [ tsp ]..
the selection of water soluble_phosphates such as monocalcium_phosphate.. readily available as super phosphate and [ tsp ] and sold in bulk quantities as fertilizers as water soluble phosphate for use in the process of o'hara_et_al would be obvious to one of ordinary_skill in the art

after the final_office_action issued rheoxs attorneys met with the examiner for an interview
the examiners interview summary provides` [ rheoxs ] [ a ] ttorney urge [ sic ] difference based on the use of slightly soluble_phosphates versus the soluble_phosphates of o'hara.. solubility data of instant compound and compounds of o'hara to be provided'

rheox filed a response amending claim 1 by replacing the reference to calcium phosphate and other types of compounds with` consisting essentially of calcium_orthophosphate'
in its response rheox also cancelled claim 2 which explicitly recited tsp and cancelled claim 3 which explicitly recited monocalcium_orthophosphate and tricalcium_diorthophosphate.4 also in original_claim 18 which is claim 8 of the ¡¬600_patent rheox removed the reference to` triple_superphosphate [ tsp ]'

rheox indicated that it made these cancellations and amendments to` distinguish the invention from the water-soluble_compounds and method of treatment taught by o'hara_et_al'
o'hara defines a water-soluble phosphate as a phosphate soluble in water at about 20¢X at least to the extent of five weight-volume percent i.e. 5g/100ml water
rheox explained that` a central_difference between the invention and the prior_art is that the presently claimed compound calcium_orthophosphate is substantially water-insoluble whereas the compounds utilized in the prior_art_processes are highly water-soluble'
to support this contention rheox provided the solubility of the claimed compound` calcium_orthophosphate' as 0.002g/100ml water
notably the solubility of tricalcium_orthophosphate is 0.002g/100ml water
the solubility of tsp is 1.8g/100ml water
rheox also asserted that the water-soluble_phosphates discussed by o'hara` are believed to be thousands of times_more_water-soluble than applicants preferred and presently claimed calcium_orthophosphate_material'
in the prosecution_history rheox further referred to` calcium_orthophosphate' with the chemical formula ca3 po4 2 which is the chemical *1323 formula of tricalcium_orthophosphate.5 rheox told the examiner that the amendments and cancellations were made` to clarify the invention and to advance the patentability of the present application'
the examiner allowed the application to issue on november 10 1992
the allowed final version of claim 1 of the ¡¬600_patent covers

1
a method of treating lead contaminated soil to reduce the amount of mobile_lead contained in said soil the method which comprises a providing an agent consisting essentially of calcium_orthophosphate ; b contacting said agent with said soil to react said agent with mobile_lead contained in the soil and form immobilized water-insoluble_lead_compounds
¡¬600_patent col._7,_l._41 to col._8,_l._2
rheox filed suit against entact alleging that entact infringed at least claim 1 of the ¡¬600_patent by using tsp_fertilizer to remediate lead-contaminated soil
it is undisputed that tsp is primarily monocalcium_orthophosphate
in fact the parties agree that if the claimed term` calcium_orthophosphate' does not include` monocalcium_orthophosphate' then entact does not infringe the ¡¬ 600 patent
entact filed counterclaims of invalidity unenforceability and antitrust violations
entact also filed third party indemnification claims against rmt inc

entact filed a motion for summary_judgment based on non-infringement of the ¡¬ 600 patent
after reviewing the prosecution_history and construing the disputed limitations of the claim the district_court granted entacts motion for summary_judgment
rheox inc. v. entact inc. no._98-3731 slip
op.at 28 d.n.j
aug._17,_2000 memorandum and order granting summary_judgment

the court began by recognizing rheoxs allegation that the ordinary_meaning of calcium_orthophosphate is a family of compounds containing a` ca 2-` cation and a` po43-` anion including monocalcium_orthophosphate and thus tsp dicalcium_orthophosphate tricalcium_orthophosphate and hydroxyapatite
id.at 13
the court stated that had the only evidence concerning the meaning of calcium_orthophosphate in the ¡¬600_patent come from treatises and dictionaries a deluge of which the parties cited it would have likely denied entacts motion for summary_judgment
id.at 15

the district_court then considered the prosecution_history and determined that rheox excluded monocalcium_orthophosphate and consequently tsp from the definition of calcium_orthophosphate in claim 1 of the ¡¬600_patent
id
the court recognized that rheox deleted all references in the claims to tsp and monocalcium_orthophosphate after the examiner rejected claims to these compounds
id.at 16
the court cited the second final office action where the examiner indicated that monocalcium_orthophosphate which is routinely available as tsp is well known in the art as water-soluble and would have been obvious to use in the o'hara_process
id
the court noted that rheox responded by canceling original_claim 2 which had identified an agent comprising a calcium phosphate *1324 fertilizer selected from a group including tsp
id.at 17
rheox also amended original_claim 18 to delete the reference to tsp
rheox stated that these changes were accomplished to distinguish the water-soluble_compounds and method of treatment taught by o'hara as well as to clarify the invention and advance the` patentability' of its application
consequently the court determined that` [ t ] he simple chronology of the prosecution_history supports a conclusion that rheox narrowed its claims to exclude tsp so that the patent_application would be approved'
id

the court rejected rheoxs argument that excluding tsp from the construction of calcium_orthophosphate reads out the ¡¬600_patents preferred_embodiment-tsp
id.at 24-25
the court determined that the prosecution_history revealed that the claims were narrowed to exclude tsp and therefore inconsistencies in the written description were not controlling
id
examining the prosecution_history the court further determined that the term` calcium_orthophosphate' refers only to tricalcium_orthophosphate
id.at 24

in sum the district_court found that entacts use of tsp does not infringe the ¡¬600_patent because` calcium_orthophosphate' in claim 1 does not include monocalcium_orthophosphate or tsp
it then found the claim_term` calcium_orthophosphate' limited to tricalcium_orthophosphate
accordingly the court granted entacts motion for summary_judgment of non-infringement
on october 23 2000 the court entered final judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure 54 b on the issue of non-infringement noting that outstanding counterclaims and third-party claims remained

analysis
although the district_court found that the term` calcium_orthophosphate' as used in claim 1 of the ¡¬600_patent is limited to tricalcium_orthophosphate that determination is not necessary to resolve this case
we need only determine whether the term *1325` calcium_orthophosphate' in claim 1 of the ¡¬600_patent covers monocalcium_orthophosphate or tsp
in regard to this limited question we find that the term does not because those compounds were disclaimed during the prosecution of the patent_application
we do not find it necessary to determine whether the term` calcium_orthophosphate' is limited to tricalcium_orthophosphate

arguments and amendments made during prosecution of a patent_application must be examined to determine the meaning of terms in the claims

rheox stresses that the ordinary and accustomed_meaning of` calcium_orthophosphate' to one of ordinary_skill in the art is a family of compounds containing a ca 2- cation and a po43- anion and that claim language should not be interpreted differently from its ordinary and accustomed_meaning based on prosecution_history unless it contains a clear_disavowal of that meaning
rheox asserts that there was no clear_disavowal of tsp in the ¡¬ 600 patents prosecution_history
it contends that a fair reading of the prosecution_history is that rheox intended to cover all of the compounds in the family of calcium_orthophosphates all of which fall substantially below the 5.0g/100ml solubility benchmark set by o'hara
tsp is substantially water-insoluble under this definition at 1.8g/100ml water
entact emphasizes and the district_court recognized that there is no evidence that rheox ever made an argument to the examiner that any compound under the 5.0g/100ml water-solubility mark referred to in o'hara is not water-soluble
the examiner did not limit the final_rejection to phosphates that cleared the alleged o'hara 5.0g/100ml water-solubility_limit
to the contrary the examiner explicitly identified monocalcium_orthophosphate and tsp as prior_art water-soluble_phosphates and stated that it would have been obvious to one of ordinary_skill in the art to select such phosphates for use in the o'hara_process

entact argues that the relevant inquiry to see if the prosecution_history limits the interpretation of a claim is whether a competitor would reasonably believe that the applicant had surrendered the relevant subject matter
cybor_corp. v. fas techs. inc. 138_f.3d_1448 1457 46_uspq2d_1169 1175 fed.cir.1998 en banc
entact further argues that rheox overcame the o'hara obviousness rejection by canceling and amending its claims to delete all references to monocalcium_orthophosphate *1326 and tsp and then arguing to the examiner that its amended claims should be allowed because its` presently claimed compound calcium_orthophosphate is substantially water-insoluble'
according to entact the prosecution_history conclusively shows that rheox disclaimed and disavowed monocalcium_orthophosphate and consequently tsp in order to achieve patentability

we assess whether a patentee relinquished a particular claim_construction based on the totality of the prosecution_history which includes amendments to claims and arguments made to overcome or distinguish references
elkay mfg co. v. ebco mfg co. 192_f.3d_973 979 52_uspq2d_1109 1113 fed.cir.1999` because it is the totality of the prosecution_history that must be assessed not the individual segments of the presentation made to the patent and trademark_office by the applicant it is irrelevant whether elkay relinquished this potential claim_construction in an amendment to the claim or in an argument to overcome or distinguish a reference
``

as originally filed claim 2 of the ¡¬600_patent was specifically directed to tsp and claim 18 was directed to a group that included tsp phosphate rock and hydroxyapatite
after an initial and final_rejection and an interview with the examiner rheox cancelled claim 2 which was explicitly directed to tsp
with painstaking surgical precision rheox also deleted the single reference to tsp in claim 18.6 rheox stated that it made the changes to` distinguish the invention from the water-soluble_compounds and method of treatment taught by o'hara'
it continued` [ a ] central_difference between the invention and the prior_art is that the presently claimed compound calcium_orthophosphate is substantially water-insoluble whereas the compounds utilized in the prior_art_processes are highly water-soluble'
it then stated that` [ i ] n this regard applicants point out that the solubility of calcium_orthophosphate is 0.002 g/100 [ ml ] [ water ]'
rheox finally stated that the` water-soluble_phosphates disclosed by o'hara_et_al
are believed to be thousands of times_more_water-soluble than applicants preferred and presently claimed calcium_orthophosphate_material'

we can not agree that rheox only disclaimed coverage of compounds with solubility over 5.0g/100ml but still retained coverage of tsp or monocalcium_orthophosphate
rheox tried to claim tsp but had to delete all reference to it to gain patentability
the deletion of only two words` triple_superphosphate [ tsp ]' from original_claim 18 now claim 8 is telling
if rheox wanted only to distinguish o'hara based on 5.0g/100ml solubility it would not have deleted tsp one of its preferred_embodiments from the claims
in the final_rejection the examiner stated that it is well known to one of ordinary_skill that monocalcium_phosphate is water-soluble and routinely available as tsp
the examiner did not reject the original_claims based on a 5.0g/100ml solubility_limit
rather he indicated that monocalcium_orthophosphate and tsp are water-soluble
therefore when rheox distinguished the present invention based on its` water-insolubility' it was arguing around the examiners comments and limiting itself to claims not encompassing *1327 monocalcium_orthophosphate and tsp
indeed it stated that the covered compounds were thousands of times less soluble than the soluble_compounds of the o'hara_patent but tsp with a solubility of 1.8g/100ml water is not even three times less soluble than o'haras disclosed solubility of 5.0g/100ml water

although we recognize that an interpretation excluding a preferred_embodiment` is rarely if ever correct and would require highly persuasive_evidentiary_support' vitronics corp. v. conceptronic inc. 90_f.3d_1576 1583-84 39_uspq2d_1573 1578 fed.cir.1996 where the prosecution_history requires a claim_construction that excludes some but not all of the preferred_embodiments such a construction is permissible and meets the standard of` highly persuasive_evidentiary_support'
this follows from our precedent that` [ t ] he prosecution_history limits the interpretation of claim_terms so as to exclude any interpretation that was disclaimed during prosecution'
southwall_techs. inc. v. cardinal_ig_co. 54_f.3d_1570 1576 34_uspq2d_1673 1676 fed.cir.1995 citations omitted

rheox also argues that the written description of the ¡¬600_patent precludes a finding that tsp was disclaimed because it indicates that tsp which is indisputably primarily monocalcium_orthophosphate is defined by the ¡¬ 600 patent as` calcium_orthophosphate'
reading the written description alone this argument might be effective but in light of the prosecution_history which was generated after the written description was drafted it is apparent that rheox relinquished any coverage of tsp

filed 70_u.s.l.w._3341_(nov._5,_2001)` even where the ordinary_meaning of the claim is clear it is well-established that [ t ] he prosecution_history limits the interpretation of claim_terms so as to exclude any interpretation that was disclaimed during prosecution
`` citing southwall 54 f.3d at 1576 34 uspq2d at 1676

conclusion
in this case the evidence establishes that rheox disclaimed monocalcium_orthophosphate and tsp in order to obtain patentability
it can not now submit an interpretation of the claims to cover what was disclaimed
for the foregoing reasons we affirm the district_courts grant of summary_judgment based on rheoxs disclaimer of tsp and monocalcium_orthophosphate and decline to decide whether the claim_term` monocalcium_orthophosphate' is necessarily limited to tricalcium_orthophosphate
