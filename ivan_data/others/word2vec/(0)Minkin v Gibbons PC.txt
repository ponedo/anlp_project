mr. herman minkin and h & m aeronaut tool company inc.` h & m' collectively` minkin' allege that the law_firm of gibbons p.c
(` gibbons' committed legal_malpractice in prosecuting the patent_application for a hand_tool called` extended reach pliers'` erp'
in early 2000 u.s. patent no._6012,363` the ¡¬363_patent` issued to mr._minkin the sole inventor based on an application written and prosecuted by gibbons
the danaher tool company` danaher' a minkin customer subsequently developed its own_version of the erp based on a simple design around and began competing against the minkin device
minkin sued gibbons alleging that the ¡¬363_patent was so negligently drafted that it offered no meaningful protection against infringers
in the malpractice litigation minkins expert proposed alternate_claim_language that allegedly could have been patented and enforced against danaher
the district_court granted summary_judgment in favor of gibbons finding that minkin failed to raise a genuine_dispute of material_fact regarding causation a necessary element in new_jersey legal_malpractice_cases

background
mr._minkin worked as an airplane mechanic serving in the united states navy and as an employee of several airlines
in the 1960s he devised a tool that could reach deep inside airplane engines without disassembling external components
the erp was designed with two pivots instead of one such that the jaws could grip in very narrow areas
mr._minkin drew a sketch of his erp reproduced below

?
in 1996 mr._minkin sought to patent his invention and retained the gibbons law_firm.1 mr._minkin gave the prosecuting attorneys access to his sketches a working prototype and a prior_art_search conducted years earlier by an independent firm
the search revealed at least eleven relevant prior_art patents many teaching multipivoted gripping tools dating back to the nineteenth century
as a cost-saving measure mr._minkin requested that gibbons not supplement the prior_art_search

gibbons prepared and filed application no._08 /660,119` the ¡¬119_application' with the united states patent and trademark office` pto' on june_7,_1996
the ¡¬119_application included three independent claims claims 1 10 and 14 and several dependent claims
originally filed claim 1 was directed to a tool having two handles joined by a first_pivot and two jaw_elements joined by a second_pivot
the claimed length of the long end of the handle was twice as long as the short end and the claimed length of the working end of the jaw was at least twice as long as the tail_end of the jaw

the examiner rejected all claims in an office_action dated october 22 1996 citing inter alia anticipation and obviousness under 35 u.s.c.¡±¡± 102_and_103
the examiner relied primarily on a 1903 reference she uncovered u.s. patent no._727279` brindos_¡¬279' disclosing tiehandling tongs
brindos_¡¬279 was cited by the examiner for both the ¡± 102 b and ¡± 103 a rejections original claims 1_and_4 were rejected as anticipated by brindos_¡¬279 ; the balance of the claims were rejected as obvious over brindos_¡¬279 alone or in combination with teachings of other prior_art_references

gibbons responded to the office_action with an amendment dated december 19 1996` the amendment'
the amendment added the following language to the end of claim 1` wherein the distance between the second_end and said first_pivot on each handle_element is at least three times longer than the distance between said tail_end and said second_pivot on each jaw_element'
joint appendix` j.a'
851
plainly stated the amendment required a minimum 3:1 ratio between the lengths of the components connecting the two pivots of the erp
the amendment minkin argued provided for an increased mechanical advantage previously unavailable

lexis 135847 at *4

the examiner issued another office_action dated april_1,_1997
while the amendment successfully overcame the anticipation rejection brindos_¡¬279 was again cited by the examiner as the basis for a continuing obviousness_rejection now including amended claim 1
the examiner stated that even though brindos_¡¬279 did not disclose the relative lengths of the handles as claimed in the ¡¬119_application it would have been obvious to one of ordinary_skill in the art at the time the erp was made to have placed the pivot points in the claimed locations
brindos_¡¬279 was also cited in view of other prior_art including u.s. patent nos._2743,726` grieshaber' 3,384,411` zlotnicki' and 3,092,152` neff' to reject as obvious the remainder of minkins claims

on august 1 1997 gibbons filed a continuation-in-part serial no._08 /904,524` the cip_application' and abandoned the ¡¬119_application
the cip_application carried forward claim 1 as modified in the amendment added drawings and included a 35 u.s.c.¡± 132 declaration directed to the examiners earlier obviousness_rejections

the examiner conducted an interview on july_14,_1999
during the interview the examiner handled a working erp prototype and as minkin tells it indicated that one day every mechanic would have an erp in their toolbox and that a patent would issue on minkins cip_application
following the interview the examiner noted on the record that she had changed her opinion as to patentability but provided no reasons
the ¡¬363_patent issued on january 11 2000 with the 3:1 pivot_ratio_limitation at the end of independent claim 1.big_token__2_figure_2__big_token of the ¡¬363_patent is reproduced below

?
*1345 mr._minkin through his new-formed company h & m began manufacturing and marketing the patented erp
by 2004 major tool companies including danaher a supplier for downstream retailers such as sears and napa were significant customers
minkin 2010_wl_5419004 at *2 2010 u.s._dist
lexis 135847 at *5-6
in mid-2007 however minkin learned that danaher had successfully designed around the constraints of the ¡¬363_patent to make and sell its own_version of the erp
minkin recognizing that the danaher_tool was non-infringing as it avoided the 3:1 ratio for the pivots sued gibbons for patent_prosecution_malpractice in state_court

the case was removed to the united_states_district_court for the district of new_jersey

to prove the patentability of alternate_claims with additional breadth minkin offered the expert testimony of richard gearhart` gearhart' a patent_attorney
minkin introduced two expert_reports prepared by gearhart
the initial expert report *1346 offered two alternate_claims for the minkin erp which gearhart asserted could have been patented 1
an article of manufacture comprising two handles each handle having a holding end a handle_intermediate_point and a connecting end the handles being pivotably connected at the handle_intermediate_point ; two jaw pieces each jaw piece having a gripping end a jaw_intermediate_point and a second_connecting_end the handles being pivotably connected at the jaw_intermediate_point ; wherein each connecting end is pivotably connected to a second_connecting_end ; and
the distance between the handle_intermediate_point and the connecting end is greater than the distance between the second_connecting_end and the jaw_intermediate_point
or
1
a device comprising ; a first_pair of parallel_arms having a first connecting end and a handle end said first parallel_arms able to swing about a first_offset_hinge said first_offset_hinge located between said first connecting end and said handle end ; a second_pair of parallel_arms having a straight clasping end and a second_connecting_end said second set of parallel_arms able to swing about a second_offset_hinge said second_offset_hinge located between said straight clasping end and said second_connecting_end ; each said second_connecting_end being capable of forming an offset_hinge by attaching to each said first connecting end ; and
a motion of said first_pair of parallel_arms about said first_offset_hinge being capable of causing a mutual motion of said second_pair of parallel_arms about said second_offset_hinge
j.a

both of gearharts alternate_claims notably eliminated the 3:1 ratio limitation added by gibbons through the amendment
the initial gearhart expert report mentioned no prior_art except for brindos_¡¬279 and indicated nothing about the impact of the prior_art on the patentability of the alternate_claims other than to state that they` would have avoided the cited prior_art'

on december 6 2009 a 37-page supplemental gearhart expert report was served
the supplemental report compares the alternate_claims to prior_art in the context of anticipation but there was no discussion of nonobviousness
id.at *6 *7-8 2010 u.s._dist
lexis 135847 at *16-17 *20-21
in deposition gearhart testified that his analysis of the prior_art in the expert_reports was limited to patentability under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 and that he had not for various reasons addressed whether his alternate_claims would have been allowed under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103
id

gibbons moved for summary_judgment pursuant to federal_rule of civil_procedure 56
in granting the summary_judgment motion the district_court found that
gearhart utterly fails to provide any sort of analysis with respect to the alleged nonobviousness of his claims and gives no opinions or explanation showing why his claims would not be deemed obvious
he makes no attempts to set forth the content of the prior_art to describe how the sample_claims differ from the prior_art nor even to identify the level of ordinary_skill in the field
indeed he makes nothing more than a bald assertion that his samples` would have avoided the prior_art' without explaining what he means by this how he arrived at such a conclusion or how it relates to obviousness
as such this *1347 statement is merely an inadmissible net opinion that fails to shed any light on the question of obviousness
minkin 2010_wl_5419004 at *6 2010 u.s._dist
lexis 135847 at *16
the district_court also noted concessions by gearhart himself including that he` had no particular opinions on the topic of nonobviousness' and that a nonobviousness analysis` would have taken too long and would have been too difficult for his colleagues to read'

lexis 135847 at *16

the district_court concluded that minkins expert did not` provide any sort of evidence demonstrating that his sample_alternative_claims are non-obvious
as such he has failed to provide the necessary proof that a patentable alternative to the ¡¬363_patent exists'

discussion
a
jurisdiction
analyzing jurisdiction the district_court found` that a substantial_question of federal law exists and that resolution of this question by the federal courts will not disrupt the balance of power between state and federal government'

lexis 135847 at *10
neither party contends that jurisdiction is lacking
notwithstanding we have an obligation to satisfy ourselves that there is jurisdiction on appeal
mansfield coldwater & lake mich. ry co. v. swan 111_u.s._379 382 4_s.ct._510 28_l.ed._462_(1884) ; immunocept llc v. fulbright & jaworski llp 504_f.3d_1281 1284 fed.cir.2007

state law patent_attorney malpractice_cases inherently pose complex jurisdictional issues.3 they require our careful consideration for example to ensure the existence of a substantial_question of federal patent law
nevertheless this courts binding precedent recognizes our jurisdiction in patent_attorney malpractice_cases such as this one in which the plaintiff is required to establish that but for attorney_negligence he would have obtained valid claims of sufficient scope that competitors could not easily avoid
see id
; see also air measurement techs. inc. v. akin gump strauss hauer & feld l.l.p. 504_f.3d_1262 1266 fed.cir.2007
in immunocept for example this court held that jurisdiction is proper where allegedly negligent patent drafting allowed competitors to avoid narrow claim scope by a simple work around
504 f.3d at 1284-85
and in davis this court held that jurisdiction is proper if in order to succeed the plaintiff must establish that it would have received a patent but for attorney_negligence during prosecution
596 f.3d at 1361 ; see also warrior_sports inc. v. dickinson wright p.l.l.c. 631_f.3d_1367 1371-72 fed.cir.2011
we conclude that our exercise of jurisdiction in this case is proper under 28 u.s.c.¡± 1338 a

b
`` suit-within-a-suit' analysis
the crux of minkins allegations is that gibbons negligently drafted patent claims overly narrow in scope constituting legal_malpractice
because state_law creates *1348 minkins cause of action for legal_malpractice this court must apply the law of new_jersey to decide whether gibbons is liable
see e.g. warrior_sports 631 f.3d at 1371-72 applying michigan law ; davis 596 f.3d at 1359-60 ohio law ; air measurement 504 f.3d at 1268-69 texas law
to establish legal_malpractice in new_jersey a variation on the tort of negligence a plaintiff must demonstrate in its case-in-chief 1 the existence of an attorney-client relationship imposing a duty of care upon the attorney ; 2 breach of that duty defined as deviation from the standard of care ; 3 proximate_causation ; and 4 damages
see garcia v. kozlov seaton romanini & brooks p.c. 179_n.j._343 357 845_a.2d_602_(2004) ; conklin v. hannoch weisman 145_n.j._395 416 678_a.2d_1060_(1996)
this case hinges on the third prong that is whether gibbonss actions proximately caused the loss to minkin

new_jersey law provides several ways of establishing proximate_causation in malpractice_cases including a` suit-within-a-suit'
garcia 179 n.j. at 358 845_a.2d_602
the suit-within-a-suit approach applies where recovery depends on success in the underlying matter and` aims to clarify what would have taken place but for the attorneys malpractice'
id
; see also conklin 145 n.j. at 417 678_a.2d_1060_(``cause_in_fact_is_sometimes_referred_to_as_'but_for'_causation...._the_simplest_understanding_of_cause_in_fact_in_attorney_malpractice_cases_arises_from_the_case-within-a-case_concept.``)
new_jersey trial_courts commonly employ this approach where the parties agree to that process
garcia 179 n.j. at 358-61 845_a.2d_602

there can be no causation demonstrated under the suit-within-a-suit rubric for patent_prosecution_malpractice where any claim drawn to the alleged invention would have lacked patentability ab initio
davis 596 f.3d at 1363-64
thus a required element of the causation_proof is for the plaintiff to demonstrate that the invention would have been patentable
see id.at 1360-64
malpractice suits in a patent prosecution context most frequently arise where attorney_negligence results in a final pto rejection
here minkin complains not that a patent did not issue but that the allowed claims were drafted too narrowly to protect the erp against competitors namely danaher
because the parties agree that the` suit-within-a-suit' analysis applies minkin must prove by preponderant_evidence that alternate_claim_language would have been deemed patentable by the pto and that it would have read on the danaher_tool

the patentability of minkins alternate claims
in granting summary_judgment the district_court held that minkin failed to raise *1349 a genuine_dispute of material_fact regarding patentability
specifically minkin provided no evidence showing that gearharts alternative_claim_language would have overcome an obviousness_rejection at the pto
see minkin 2010_wl_5419004 at *6 2010 u.s._dist
lexis 135847 at *17` in short gearhart has entirely failed to provide any evidence demonstrating that his sample_claims are not obvious

id.at 325 106_s.ct._2548
the burden then shifts to the nonmoving party to set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine_dispute for trial
azur 601 f.3d at 216
where a nonmoving party fails to make a showing sufficient to establish an element essential of that partys case and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial summary_judgment is required under the plain language of rule 56
see celotex_corp. 477 u.s. at 322-23 106_s.ct._2548

on appeal minkin argues that a it did not have the burden of showing the nonobviousness of the alternate_claims at the summary_judgment_stage of the proceeding b even if it did have the burden at the summary_judgment_stage the nonobviousness of the alternate_claims was shown in the 37-page gearhart supplemental report and c the trial_court should have inferred the nonobviousness of gearharts alternative_claim_language because the ¡¬363_patent issued after an in-person_interview
none of these arguments has merit

a. minkin had the burden of showing nonobviousness
minkin contends based on this courts opinion in davis 596 f.3d at 1363-64 that it did not have the burden on summary_judgment of establishing that its alternative_claims were nonobvious beyond simply distinguishing prior_art
in davis summary_judgment was granted in favor of the defendant because the aggrieved applicants expert had provided only naked conclusions regarding the patentability of the invention
id
this court affirmed the result but added [ w ] e reject the suggestion that ms._davis would have had to identify claims for her inventions or perform a patentability_analysis similar to that required in an invalidity_trial
ms._daviss ultimate_burden in this case is to establish the likelihood that her inventions would have been held patentable on examination in the pto.. at the summary_judgment_stage she had only to introduce evidence sufficient to establish an issue of material_fact as to patentability
ms._davis could have satisfied this initial burden in any number of ways.. mr. o'shaughnessy [ plaintiffs expert ] could have reviewed the prior_art_references cited in the office_actions and discussed their effect on patentability
*1350 id.at 1364
minkin argues that this language in davis announced a more deferential_standard in malpractice_cases than is required in ordinary infringement suits and that the district_court erred in requiring any discussion of nonobviousness at the summary_judgment_stage

minkin misreads davis
the statement above does not establish a more deferential_standard for malpractice_cases specifically ; rather it is a routine observation about evidentiary showings required under rule 56 generally
compare id
with celotex_corp. 477 u.s. at 324 106_s.ct._2548` we do not mean that the nonmoving party must produce evidence in a form that would be admissible at trial in order to avoid summary_judgment.. rule 56 e permits a proper summary_judgment motion to be opposed by any of the kinds of evidentiary materials listed in rule 56 c..'
thus while a full` patentability_analysis similar to that required in an invalidity_trial' is not necessary davis 596 f.3d at 1364 summary_judgment is nonetheless`proper where the pleadings depositions answers to interrogatories admissions and affidavits show there is no genuine_issue of material_fact` azur 601 f.3d at 216 quoting nicini 212 f.3d at 805
we find that under the regular evidentiary burdens of rule 56 minkin had` to introduce evidence sufficient to establish an issue of material_fact as to patentability'
davis 596 f.3d at 1364

patentability necessarily includes the condition that an invention consist of nonobvious subject matter

in its motion for summary_judgment gibbons identified ¡± 103 a issues with respect to the alternate_claims submitting expert opinion questioning minkins ability to obtain even broader scope in light of the record
because it was minkins ultimate_burden at trial to establish nonobviousness it bore the burden on summary_judgment of demonstrating a disputed material_fact regarding this essential_element of its case especially given that gibbons put ¡± 103 a directly at issue

v. vanvoorhies 278_f.3d_1288 1295 fed.cir.2002` summary_judgment must be granted against a party who has not introduced evidence sufficient to establish the existence of an essential_element of that partys case on which the party would bear the burden of proof at trial
``

minkin defends that it would have been too cumbersome in the first instance to` prove a negative' by addressing every potential combination of prior_art that could be used in an obviousness_rejection.4 minkin suggests that merely distinguishing each prior_art reference individually was sufficient to defeat summary_judgment reflecting actual practice before the pto where applicants often await an examiners specific ¡± 103 a rejections before discussing nonobviousness

we recognize that applicants do not typically prove` validity' against all prior_art and only show that claims are not invalid over references cited against them
but the order of typical prosecution practice is irrelevant to the procedural posture here
malpractice cases under a suit-within-a-suit_framework require as part of the plaintiffs case-in-chief a demonstration of *1351 the likelihood of patentability
see davis 596 f.3d at 1363-64
in the context of summary_judgment we hold that the district_court was obligated to determine whether minkin could satisfy its ultimate_burden of showing patentability in light of gibbonss motion
rule 56 is designed to assess sooner rather than later the parties proof in order to see whether there is a genuine need for trial

if minkin had factual disputes concerning nonobviousness it was obligated to raise them in response to the properly supported motion for summary_judgment expressly relying on ¡± 103 a

minkin however failed to raise a single material_fact in dispute as to the nonobviousness of the proposed alternate_claims

b
the supplemental report was not sufficient
minkin argues that even if it did have the burden as to nonobviousness it met that burden by thoroughly analyzing sixteen prior_art_references and their relationship to the alternate_claims
while admitting that there is no express discussion of ¡± 103 a in any report minkin argues that the district_court ignored the nonobviousness implications of gearharts 37-page supplemental report

the district_court did consider and address gearharts 37-page supplemental_expert_report in detail
see minkin 2010_wl_5419004 at *7-8 2010 u.s._dist
lexis 135847 at *20-21
it found that minkin did not carry its burden with respect to patentability in the supplemental_expert_report which did` not touch on obviousness whatsoever'

according to the district_court while gearharts supplemental_expert_report` does provide certain opinions on the patentability of his alternate_claims' it was nonetheless` clear beyond all doubt that the opinions contained therein are strictly limited to novelty/anticipation concerns'
id
the district_court concluded that` gearhart has failed to provide any sort of evidence demonstrating that his sample_alternative_claims are non-obvious'
id.at *8 2010 u.s._dist

we agree
gearharts supplemental_expert_report only states his view that the alternate_claims would have overcome a ¡± 102 challenge
we have held however that anticipation and obviousness are separate conditions of patentability requiring different tests and different elements of proof
cohesive techs. inc. v. waters corp. 543_f.3d_1351 1364 fed.cir.2008 ; duro-last inc. v. custom seal inc. 321_f.3d_1098 1107-08 fed.cir.2003 ; see generally ksr int l co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 406-07 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007)
minkins attempt to recast its anticipation analysis as sufficient for nonobviousness purposes is unavailing
gearhart testified that his expert analysis of the prior_art was limited to potential rejections under ¡± 102 ; he further conceded that he did not undertake any analysis of ¡± 103 a and admitted that` it would bevery speculative to say that the pto *1352 would have issued his sample_claims'
minkin 2010_wl_5419004 at *6 2010 u.s._dist
lexis 135847 at *16-17 internal citations omitted
indeed gearharts expert_reports failed even to discuss the nonobviousness of his sample_claims over the prior_art cited in ¡± 103 rejections during the prosecution history of the ¡¬363_patent including not only brindos_¡¬279 but grieshaber zlotnicki and neff

we find that the 37-page gearhart report contains nothing to assist the trier of fact with respect to the unique tests and proofs of ¡± 103 a and provides no insight into the question of whether the alternate_claims would ultimately have been allowed by the pto
the movant may prevail under rule 56 by exposing` the absence of evidence to support the nonmoving partys case'
celotex_corp. 477 u.s. at 325 106_s.ct._2548
the trial_court did not err in finding that minkin failed to provide evidence demonstrating that its alternate_claims are nonobvious.5

c. no inference of patentability from the ¡¬363_patent
minkin argues that since that the examiner ultimately granted the ¡¬363_patent after an office interview the court should infer from that favorable history that gearharts alternate_claim_language would also be deemed nonobvious
the district_court refused to recognize that a` presumption of non-obviousness attaches' in this context calling this minkin argument` weak'` unsupported' and` contrary to common sense'

we agree

the challenge for gibbons all along as noted by the district_court was drafting broadly in the face of such a crowded_art_field
id.at *6-7 2010 u.s._dist
lexis 135847 at *18
including a 3:1 pivot_ratio_limitation was the final compromise to the claim language agreed on by the examiner and inventor in an effort to secure patentability
the language of the issued ¡¬363_patent however is entirely distinct from the alternate_claim_language drafted by gearhart who attempts to capture more scope for purposes of this litigation
an inference of nonobviousness does not attach to the alternate_claims by virtue of the issued ¡¬363_patent because the claim terms are different
the fact that the erp was ultimately deemed nonobvious after handling a prototype does not mean that an examiner would necessarily decide same thing if the claims were broader
we therefore refuse to conclude that an examiner would have allowed gearharts alternate_claims of greater scope just because the more narrow ¡¬363_patent issued after an in-person_interview

iii
conclusion
providing no evidence of nonobviousness minkin failed to establish a genuine_dispute of material_fact as to the patentability of its alternate_claims
because minkin did not carry its burden on causation the district_courts summary_judgment in favor of gibbons is

affirmed

as the majority notes in section ii a. there is binding precedent that compels that we decide the merits of this case
