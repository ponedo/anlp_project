patent holder appealed
the court of appeals rich circuit_judge held that claims of patent describing process for decaffeination of coffee were not invalid on ground of double_patenting of claims in earlier-issued patent for process of recovering caffeine for decaffeinated_coffee since the two patents did not claim the same_invention and neither claimed process was a mere_obvious_variation of the other

background
this declaratory_judgment_suit is between a licensor and licensee over patents relating to decaffeinated_coffee
plaintiff general foods corporation gf owns maxwell house coffee company which manufactures decaffeinated_coffee at its amco_plant in houston texas for sale under brands such as sanka maxim brim yuban and maxwell house
gf also owns kaffee hag a processor and research company in bremen germany which is said to have been the first producer of decaffeinated_coffee

sgk developed in europe inventions relating to decaffeination and owned five united states patents involved in this lawsuit
learning about sgks developments gf entered into an exclusive_license_agreement with sgk effective february 1 1978 which has now become a nonexclusive license on which it paid royalties to sgk through 1990 since then paying further royalties under protest
the license agreement provided for advance payments totalling $ 1,800,000 during the first year
royalties were to range from 1.75 % of net decaffeinated_coffee sales up to 40,000,000 *1274 pounds down to 1.25 % of net sales over 120,000,000 pounds

gf brought this suit for a declaration of non-infringement invalidity and unenforceability as to all five patents
however the district_court found that although all five sgk patents were licensed sgk now asserts that only claims 1_and_4 of the639_patent would be infringed by gfs operation at the amco_plant and that the other four patents are no longer in suit
although gf asserted numerous defenses against claims 1_and_4 including invalidity for` obviousness-type_double_patenting' non-infringement obviousness under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 non-enablement under 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 and unenforceability due to inequitable conduct before the patent and trademark office pto the district_court issued an order of trial on april_5,_1991 on gfs motion to` bifurcate the issue of double_patenting'
the order further stated` if the decision does not dispose of the action trial will then immediately continue on the remaining issues'

the district_court held a separate trial on the single issue of double_patenting
a judgment was entered holding claims 1_and_4 of the639_patent invalid thus terminating gfs declaratory_judgment_suit seeking invalidity of the only patent it was alleged to be infringing and putting an end to its obligation to pay sgk royalties under its contract
765_f.supp._121

this appeal followed and as above stated there is only one issue for us to decide-is there double_patenting
we shall first discuss the facts regarding the two patents involved and then the law of double_patenting as it applies to those facts

patent claims
preliminarily in order to better focus on the crucial aspects of the patents under discussion we make the following elementary observations about patent_claims
the patent document which grants the patentee a right to exclude others and hence bestows on the owner the power to license consists of two primary parts 1 a written description of the invention which may and here does include drawings called the` specification' enabling those skilled in the art to practice the invention and 2 claims which define or delimit the scope of the legal protection which the government grant gives the patent owner the patent` monopoly'
as stated by judge lane who served on both of our predecessor courts in in re_vogel 422_f.2d_438 164_uspq_619_(ccpa1970)` a claim is a group of words defining only the boundary of the patent monopoly'
( emphasis ours
the supreme court has likened patent_claims to the description of real property in a deed` which sets the bounds to the grant which it contains
it is to the claims of every patent therefore that we must turn when we are seeking to determine what the invention is the exclusive use of which is given to the inventor by the grant provided for in the statute -'he can claim nothing beyond them
`` motion picture patents co. v. universal film mfg co. 243_u.s._502 510 37_s.ct._416 418 61_l.ed._871_(1917) emphasis_ours

that being the essential nature of patent_claims it follows that each claim is an entity which must be considered as a whole
it can not be said-though it often is incorrectly by the uninitiated-that a part of a claim is` claimed' subject_matter
for example a claim to a process comprising the step_a followed by step b followed by step c defines as a matter of law only the a-b-c process and one can not properly speak of any single step as being` claimed' for it is not ; all that is claimed is the process consisting of the combination of all three steps
such a claim therefore creates no patent right or monopoly in step_a no right to prevent others from using step_a apart from the combination of steps a-b-c
step a is not` patented'

another way of stating the legal truism is that patent_claims being definitions which must be read as a whole do not` claim' or cover or protect all that their words may disclose
even though the claim to the a-b-c combination of steps contains a detailed_description of step_a that does not give the patentee any patent *1275 right in step_a and it is legally incorrect to say that step_a is` patented'

these legal rules about construing claims are repeated here because the law of double_patenting is concerned only with what patents claim
`` double_patenting' therefore involves an inquiry into what if anything has been claimed twice

the patent in suit and its claimed invention
coffee beans contain a small percentage of caffeine which must be removed to produce decaffeinated_coffee
the inventor kurt zosel working in germany for sgk discovered that moist i.e. containing water` supercritical' carbon_dioxide that is carbon_dioxide above its critical_temperature and critical_pressure was an excellent solvent for taking the caffeine out of coffee beans
that was the basic invention
the parties and the trial_court have referred to the patent on this invention as` the decaffeination_patent'

a u.s. application for patent on this invention was filed january 28 1971 serial no._110428
this application was prosecuted to the point where all pending claims were allowed following the usual debate with the examiner over unobviousness in view of prior_art_references
the official notice of allowance was mailed by the pto march_8,_1973
payment of the base issue fee was due within three months june_8,_1973

upon examining the 13 allowed claims prior to issue zosel and/or his attorneys realized that all claims were limited to raw_coffee_beans and it was concluded that the application disclosure would support broader_claims not limited to raw_coffee but broad enough to include roasted coffee ; i.e. claims simply calling for` coffee'
it was decided therefore to file a continuation-in-part application a cip with such broader_claims
this was done within the time limit allowed by pto rules and application serial no._3 64,190 was filed on may_25,_1973
original application serial no._110428 according to the usual practice was allowed to go abandoned

the try for broader_claims did not succeed in a prosecution that was hard fought and went all the way to the pto board of patent_appeals and interferences board
zosel and his assignee sgk ended up with a board decision on july_12,_1979 that allowed claims to no more than had originally been allowed claims to the new process as applied to raw_coffee_beans
the board held the disclosure in zosels original application did not support claims naming` coffee' generally wherefore he was entitled only to the filing_date of the cip to which he had added supporting disclosure
given that filing_date there was new prior_art which barred claims not restricted to raw_coffee
the board said we affirm the rejection of claims 1-14 [ the new broad coffee claims ] under 35_usc_102 d as anticipated by the british patent
contrary to appellants assertion the decaffeination of coffee in general i.e
from both its raw and roasted state by the claimed expedient is not implicit in the disclosure of the parent application
we are not concerned on this appeal with this aspect of the boards decision
it simply concluded zosels effort to get broad` coffee' claims

the more interesting aspect of the boards decision relates to the double_patenting_issue now before us
during the cip prosecution the examiner had made obviousness-type double_patenting_rejections based on the claims of zosels u.s._patent_no._3806,619 issued april_23,_1974 the same619_patent relied on by the district_court in support of the double_patenting decision here under review
the double_patenting_issue was extensively debated between the examiner and applicants attorney and went to the board on appeal from the examiners final rejection
the board reversed the examiners rejections for obviousness-type_double_patenting
the board concluded emphasis_ours in re borah 53_ccpa_800 354_f.2d_1009 148_uspq_213 [ 1966 ] supports appellants position that the test for double_patenting is whether or not the subject_matter of the patent_claims is obvious from the subject_matter of the claims *1276 at issue
clearly here steps b through j of the [619 ] patent_claims are not suggested by nor obvious from the claims at bar the patent_claims being a separate and distinct improvement invention thereover and consequently no double_patenting_rejection is seen to be proper

thereafter zosel cancelled the rejected claims received a notice of allowance and the639_patent in suit was issued on april_7,_1981

claims 1_and_4 of the639_patent held invalid in this suit for double_patenting in view of the619_patent contrary to the unanimous decision of the board on the identical issue read as follows 1
a process for the decaffeination of raw_coffee which comprises contacting the raw_coffee with water-moist_carbon_dioxide above its critical_temperature and critical_pressure to effect removal of caffeine therefrom and recovering a substantially decaffeinated_coffee the amount of water in the carbon_dioxide being sufficient to effectuate said removal of the caffeine from the coffee
4
a process as claimed in claim 1 in which the contact with the moist_carbon_dioxide is effected for a period of from 5_to_30 hours
it will be observed that this process consists of two steps 1 a caffeine removal step and 2 a decaffeinated-coffee recovery step
the claim 4 time limitation addition to claim 1 is of no significance to the decision of the issue here

the invention of claim 1 of the619_patent relied on below to show double_patenting
zosel more than a year after he had filed his foreign application to patent his decaffeination_process on which his u.s. parent and cip_applications were based made a further invention which the parties have characterized as an` improvement' on the original process
it is however a separate invention unrelated to the decaffeination_invention defined in claims 1_and_4
its purpose was to effect an efficient removal from the supercritical carbon_dioxide solvent used to extract caffeine from the raw_coffee_beans of the caffeine removed so as to obtain caffeine of better than 95 % purity
the shorter version of the general description of this recovery_process in the619_patent is as follows:1

[ the process for recovering caffeine ] which comprises removing the caffeine from the caffein-loaded carbon_dioxide by repeated treatment with water and recovering the caffein and the water from the resultant dilute aqueous caffein solution by recycling a stream of air or nitrogen under a superatmospheric pressure of about 1_to_5 atmospheres through the heated caffein solution and a heat_exchanger separating the caffein and the condensed water and recycling after admixture of cold caffein solution the gas through the heat_exchanger in countercurrent flow relation and meeting the heat requirement by supplying heat to the hot caffein solution
the patent specification then proceeds with a detailed_description of the recovery_process in conjunction with a drawing of the processing apparatus employed
what has caused much of the argument and most of the confusion in this case is the brief reference in the619_patent to the639_patent decaffeination_process as the source of the caffeine in the` caffein-loaded carbon_dioxide' which is the input to the recovery_process
the totality of that reference in the619_patent is in the opening paragraphs of the specification austrian pat
no._290962 and u.s. [ cip ] application ser
no._3 64,190 filed may_25,_1973 disclose a process for decaffeinating green_coffee wherein moist_carbon_dioxide is recycled through a bed of green_coffee and a bed of activated charcoal
the moist_carbon_dioxide passes through the green_coffee bed in supercritical_state and through the bed of activated charcoal at a lower temperature in *1277 liquified state
the moist_carbon_dioxide in supercritical_state is loaded thereby with the caffein of the green_coffee and the caffein is absorbed on the activated charcoal
the recovery of the caffein from the activated charcoal is not described in the patent mentioned above

the parties and the trial_court have appropriately referred to the619_patent as` the caffeine_recovery_patent'

it should be amply clear by now that the decaffeination_invention and the caffeine_recovery_invention are separate and distinct_inventions directed to different objectives and patentably distinguishable one from the other
neither is statutory` prior_art' to the other because the patent applications were copending and further because there can be no` prior invention by another` cf
35 u.s.c.¡± 102 g because both are the inventions of zosel

claim 1 of the619_patent on the basis of which the district_court found double_patenting reads 1
a process for obtaining caffein from green_coffee which comprises a. contacting moist_carbon_dioxide in supercritical_state with the coffee in a caffein absorption_zone for absorption of caffein by the moist_carbon_dioxide b. withdrawing the moist_carbon_dioxide containing absorbed caffein from the absorption_zone and contacting it with water for extraction of caffein from the moist_carbon_dioxide in an extraction_zone for formation of an aqueous_solution of caffein c. recirculating the moist_carbon_dioxide between the absorption_zone and the contacting zone d. withdrawing aqueous_solution of carbon_dioxide from the extracting zone and introducing it into an evaporating_zone passing a stream of air or nitrogen through the aqueous_solution in the evaporating_zone for evaporation of water from the solution and concentration of caffein in the aqueous_solution and withdrawing a concentrated_aqueous_solution from the evaporating_zone e. withdrawing the air or nitrogen laden with water_vapor from the evaporating_zone and cooling it for condensation of water and separating the water from the air or nitrogen in a separating zone f. recirculating the air or nitrogen between the evaporating_zone and the separating zone g. admixing aqueous_solution of carbon_dioxide from the extraction_zone with the air or nitrogen conveyed from the separating zone to the evaporating_zone h. passing the air or nitrogen laden with water_vapor and the admixture formed in step g in indirect_heat_exchange_relation between the evaporating_zone and the separating zone for cooling of the air or nitrogen laden with water_vapor for the condensation of step e and heating said admixture for heating the aqueous_solution for the evaporation and
[ sic-no step i ]
j. supplying additional_heat to the aqueous_solution for the evaporation

that this claim 1 of the619_patent is the sole basis of the ultimate double_patenting holding of the trial_court is shown in its conclusion of law 24 which reads 24
for all the foregoing reasons we find [ sic hold ] that claim 1 of the decaffeination_patent [639 ] is obvious from claim 1 a of the caffeine_recovery_patent [619 ]
consequently plaintiff is entitled to a judgment declaring claim 1 of the decaffeination_patent invalid on the ground of obviousness-type_double_patenting

analysis
double_patenting is altogether a matter of what is claimed
claim interpretation is a question of law which we review de novo
loctite corp. v. ultraseal ltd. 781_f.2d_861 228_uspq_90_(fed.cir.1985)
as we construe the claims here involved claims 1_and_4 of the patent in suit639 define a process of decaffeinating raw_coffee with supercritical water-moist carbon *1278 dioxide and recovering the decaffeinated_coffee
they say nothing about what happens to the caffeine
claim 1 of the619_patent relied on to show double_patenting defines a 9-step process of` obtaining caffein from green_coffee'
anything less than a process with all 9 steps is not what is claimed and is therefore not patented
claims must be read as a whole in analyzing a claim of double_patenting
carman indus. inc. v. wahl 724_f.2d_932 940 220_uspq_481 487 fed.cir.1983` we wish to clarify that double_patenting is determined by analysis of the claims as a whole'
these two inventions decaffeination of coffee and recovery of caffeine are separate patentably distinct_inventions between which there can not be double_patenting
clearly the two patents do not claim the same_invention and this is not argued
under an obviousness-type_double_patenting analysis neither claimed process is a mere_obvious_variation of the other
no other kind of` double_patenting' is recognized so there is no double_patenting
that concludes the case so far as this appeal is concerned
a discussion of the law which supports our conclusion follows

no double_patenting between patentably distinct inventions
the opinion in in re_vogel 422_f.2d_438 164_uspq_619_(ccpa1970) undertook a` restatement of the law of double_patenting as enunciated by this court'
to summarize it the opinion says that the first question is is the same_invention being claimed twice ?
if the answer to that is no a second question must be asked does any claim in the application define merely an obvious_variation of an invention claimed in the patent asserted as supporting double_patenting ?
if the answer to that question is no there is no double_patenting
the court was speaking of course about the pto rejection of a pending patent application intended to forestall double_patenting
if the rejected claim defines more than an obvious_variation it is patentably distinct

one of our most recent double_patenting decisions is in re braat 937_f.2d_589 19_uspq2d_1289_(fed.cir.1991) in which we held thus a double_patenting_rejection is sustainable here only if claims 5/big_token__1_and_6__big_token /1 of dil are not patentably distinct from the subject_matter defined by the rejected claims of braat.. [ the claim numbers refer to dependent claims 5_and_6 both depending from claim 1 ]
..... [ w ] e conclude that the claims of the braat_application and the dil patent are patentably distinct and that the double_patenting_rejection was in error
id.at 594 19 uspq2d at 1293 emphasis added
with respect to extension of patent_protection we said in braat it is true that allowance of the braat_application will result in some timewise extension of philips patent_protection of the dil structure
this is because braats claims dominate the invention of dil claims 5/big_token__1_and_6__big_token /1
as our predecessor court pointed out in borah in analogizing the stanley decision` we see.. that as a matter of law the extension of protection_objection is not necessarily controlling'
id
( emphasis added
just a fortnight before braat we decided symbol technologies inc. v. opticon inc. 935_f.2d_1569 19_uspq2d_1241_(fed.cir.1991) in which the court said furthermore even if there had been a breach of the restriction requirement we would reject opticons argument on the ultimate obviousness-type_double_patenting_inquiry whether the claims of the186_patent are patentably distinct from the claims of the297_patent
see in re borah 354_f.2d_1009 1017 148_uspq_213 220 ccpa1966 crux of obviousness-type_double_patenting_inquiry lies in comparison of claims.. id.at 1580 19 uspq2d at 1249 emphasis added

the extensive opinion in in re borah 354_f.2d_1009 148_uspq_213 ccpa1966 in its concluding pages shows beyond question that the determining factor in deciding whether or not there is *1279 double_patenting is the existence vel non of patentable difference between two sets of claims
the phrases actually used in the opinion include` patentably distinguishable'` patentable distinctions' and` whether such differences would have been obvious to one of ordinary_skill in the art'
they are all equivalent
the opinion summarizes two earlier cases spanning three decades to the same effect citing them as established law with full approval namely in re stanley 214_f.2d_151 102_uspq_234_(ccpa1954) and in re calvert 97_f.2d_638 38_uspq_184_(ccpa1938)

before leaving borah we call attention to the following statement there made in the courts discussion of stanley in stanley this court sanctioned in 1954 the issuance of a dominating patent to the owner of the improvement_patent which had issued in 1950 notwithstanding the owners protection would thereby be extended beyond the expiration of the improvement_patent by several years
we see therefore that as a matter of law the extension of protection_objection is not necessarily controlling
354 f.2d at 1017 148 uspq at 220

we find in the facts of the instant case a parallel situation
the facts here indicate that in the commercial decaffeination of raw_coffee the processor is interested for economic reasons not only in the effective decaffeination of raw_coffee but in the effective recovery of pure caffeine as a by-product
therefore both of zosels inventions are preferably used in the same_commercial_process
these patentably distinct process inventions are covered by separate patents however which happen to expire at different times
each process nevertheless is capable of being used by itself
the fact that it may be desirable to use both inventions in the same_commercial_process does not result however in any recognized form of double_patenting or in the` extension' of either patent ; each patent has a term of seventeen years

a licensee which has taken a license under both patents choosing to use the inventions claimed in both patents in the same_commercial_process must know that in the absence of some agreement to the contrary it is not excused from paying royalty after one of the patents expires while the other is still in force and the invention it claims is being used
in the 1978 exclusive_license_agreement entered into by gf and sgk the licensed` patent rights' were set forth in a schedule of some 21 u.s. and foreign patents and applications with a wide range of expiration dates
included therein are patent619 which had issued in 1974 and both the parent and cip_applications serial nos._110 428_and_364190 which resulted in the639_patent in suit in 1981
the record shows that before the license was entered into gf had been supplied with copies of the parent and cip_application prosecution histories and was therefore fully informed about aspects of the639 prosecution history it now attempts to use to show invalidity on double_patenting grounds particularly the decision to file the cip_application which gf now depicts as a deliberate effort by sgk to` extend' its protection by obtaining` a 24-year patent' to cover the inventions of others etc
it has to be considered a bit odd that after enjoying the benefits of a license to use the principal invention which caused it to take a license in 1978-the decaffeination_process which it knew was not yet patented not the caffeine recovery` improvement' which it no longer wishes to use-and although fully informed about the prosecution of the patent on that decaffeination_invention it comes up with the contention a decade later that that patent is invalid and files the present declaratory_judgment_suit in 1988 to test its theory
at least it would seem odd but for the realization that if its theory can be put across it will save gf a lot of money
during the time gf was an exclusive licensee its interest in having the broadest and longest patent_protection on the decaffeination_process was as great as sgks

determining what is patented by correct claim interpretation is essential to determination of obviousness-type double_patenting issues
the basic concept of double_patenting is that the same_invention can not be *1280 patented more than once which if it happened would result in a second_patent which would expire some time after the original patent and extend the protection timewise
but double_patenting law has always been more inclusive
double_patenting law principles extend to merely obvious variants of what has been patented
step one of the analysis is to determine what that is
claims are the determinants

in the cases which are mostly from the court of customs and patent_appeals now merged with the former court of claims to form this court the development of the law came to a turning point in in re zickendraht 319_f.2d_225 138_uspq_22_(ccpa1963) particularly in the concurring opinion therein
soon thereafter the obvious variant kind of double_patenting came to be known as` obviousness-type' double_patenting which signifies that the difference between the first-patented invention and its variant involves only an unpatentable difference no second_patentable_invention having been made
the zickendraht concurring opinion suggested that an obviousness-type_double_patenting situation could be overcome by filing a terminal disclaimer which had been provided for in section 253 of the 1952 patent act for that very purpose
however where the two inventions are patentably distinct no disclaimer is called for
where there is a second_patentable_invention as there is here because the difference is not an obvious one it is important to bear in mind that comparison can be made only with what invention is claimed in the earlier patent paying careful attention to the rules of claim_interpretation to determine what invention a claim defines and not looking to the claim for anything that happens to be mentioned in it as though it were a prior_art_reference
this was not done by the trial_court
rather it was carefully misguided by gfs arguments into doing exactly the opposite as we shall now show

it should suffice we feel to point out the principal error into which the trial_court was led which resides in a complete misinterpretation of claim 1 set forth above of the619_patent on the caffeine_recovery_process now expired
we have quoted above immediately following claim 1 of the619_patent conclusion of law 24 which is the ultimate error
the gist of it is that claim 1 of patent639 in suit is` obvious from claim 1 a' of patent619
of course there is no such thing as` claim 1 a' a term used no less than 11 times throughout the findings of fact and conclusions of law
there is a claim 1 and the first_step of its 9 recited steps is designated` a'
and that step recites the essence of the very same process claimed in the639_patent in suit but in accordance with the principles of claim_construction discussed early in this opinion step a is not` claimed' in the619_patent nor is it` patented' or` covered' as the trial_court seems to have thought it was as shown by its finding of fact 58 which says` it was obvious to one of ordinary_skill in the art that supercritical carbon_dioxide would substantially decaffeinate coffee as otherwise it would not be claimed in claim 1 of the619_patent..' emphasis ours
this concept violates the fundamental rule of claim_construction that what is claimed is what is defined by the claim taken as a whole every claim limitation here each step being material
what is patented by claim 1 of619 is a 9-step caffeine_recovery_process nothing more and nothing less

a further error of the trial_court in dealing with the619_patents claim 1 was in looking not at what invention it defines but at whatever the claim discloses illustrated by findings of fact 68_and_69
68
there can not be double_patenting here unless the plaintiff [ gf ] establishes inter alia that claims 1_and_4 of the639_patent are obvious from the claims of the619_patent as interpreted by the specification in view of the prior_art
this is perfectly sound law if one construes` from the claims' to mean from the invention defined by the claims but in the next finding the court jumps the track emphasis_ours 69
claim 1 a of the619_patent anticipates or at least renders obvious the inventions of claims 1_and_4 of the639_patent because every step of *1281 claims 1_and_4 of the639_patent is set forth in claim 1 a of the619_patent..
this clearly is using nothing but the disclosure of clause a of claim 1 as though it were prior_art and in not reading claim 1 to determine what invention it defines-like the metes and bounds of a deed
we repeat clause a of claim 1 is not a claim patent619 does not claim clause a but a 9-step process of which a is the first_step and double_patenting is based entirely on what is claimed reading each claim as an entirety to determine what invention it defines

a further illustration of the same misconstruction of claims by reading them for what they disclose rather than to determine what they define appears in conclusion of law 18 which says in part` in this case the only relevant inquiry is whether the claims of the first patentdisclose [ ] to one of ordinary_skill in the art the claims of the second_patent'
( emphasis ours
the source of the quoted phrase is not given
the court failed to observe the distinction between a claim as a written disclosure and a claim as a definition of an invention

how the meaningless confusing and highly misleading expression` claim 1 a' got injected into this case` is a puzzlement'
we are also perplexed as to what the trial_court meant by it in its constantly reiterated use
there is some evidence the court was led to believe that clause a of claim 1 was actually a claim in the sense that the words` claim' and` claimed' are used in the law of double_patenting and in patent law generally
if that is so we express sincere sympathy for the trial judge in his efforts to understand this double_patenting_issue a subject usually fraught with difficulty
there is a much stronger indication that gfs counsel are responsible for the use of the term` claim 1 a'
whether they originated it or not they have perpetuated it in the course of ten pages of their brief before this court main brief at pages 39-49 the term appearing at least once on every page except page 47 and altogether 17 times
this fictitious` claim 1 a' which is supposed to define some already patented invention is then argued to make the invention claimed in the patent in suit obvious if not anticipated which is the epitome of obviousness
this may seem plausible because` claim 1 a' is a description of that very invention
but in the first place this argument fails because it totally ignores the rules of claim_interpretation and in the second place it is used as though it is a prior_art disclosure for everything recited in claim 1 being applied to support an obviousness rejection under 35_usc_103
this is impermissible in the law of double_patenting

precedents prohibit use of disclosure of patent cited to support double_patenting
our precedent makes clear that the disclosure of a patent cited in support of a double_patenting_rejection can not be used as though it were prior_art even where the disclosure is found in the claims
see e.g. braat 937 f.2d at 594_n._5 19 uspq2d at 1293_n._5_(``the_patent_disclosure_must_not_be_used_as_prior_art'') ; vogel 422 f.2d at 442 164 uspq at 622 in considering obviousness-type_double_patenting` the patent disclosure may not be used as prior_art' ; in re plank 399_f.2d_241 242 158_uspq_328 329 ccpa1968` its claims [ plank et al
patent ] are used as the basis for a double_patenting_rejection
it is not a prior_art_reference' ; in re aldrich 398_f.2d_855 859 158_uspq_311 314 ccpa1968` double_patenting_rejections can not be based on section 103.. or on the disclosures of the patents whose claims are relied on to demonstrate double_patenting or on thedisclosures of their claims.. [ p ] atent claims are looked to only to see what has been patented the subject_matter which has been protected not for something one may find to be disclosed by reading them' ; in re boylan 392_f.2d_1017 1018_n._1 157_uspq_370 371_n._1_(ccpa1968)` in analyzing cases of these types it must always be carefully observed that the appellants patent is notprior_art under either section 102 or section 103 of the 1952 patent act' ; *1282 in re braithwaite 379_f.2d_594 600_n._4 154_uspq_29 34_n._4_(ccpa1967)` while analogous to the non-obviousness requirement of 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 that section is not itself involved in double_patenting_rejections because the patent principally underlying the rejection is not prior_art' ; borah 354 f.2d at 1018 148 uspq at 221` we have no prior_art here' ; in re sutherland 347_f.2d_1009 1015 146_uspq_485 491 ccpa1965` nor is obviousness invariably involved indouble_patenting rejections
claims relied on in such [ double_patenting ] rejections often disclose or name the very thing being claimed [ in the rejected claims ]
furthermore the words of such claims can not be treated asprior_art.. but are looked to solely for the purpose of determining what has already been patented
they are not treated as prior_art for the simple reason they are no moreprior_art under the statute than the specification' citation omitted ; in re sarett 327_f.2d_1005 1013 140_uspq_474 481 ccpa1964` we are not here concerned with what one skilled in the art would be aware [ of ] from reading the claims but with what inventions the claims define'

the619_patent during its term provided no protection for the invention claimed in the639_patent
double_patenting is intended to prevent unjustified extension of protection
because the trial_court misunderstood the construction of patent_claims it failed to appreciate that the invention of the second-to-issue639_patent received no protection from the first-issued619_patent because no claim of the latter covers the decaffeination_process
protection of that invention did not begin until the639_patent issued on april_7,_1981
it will expire 17 years thereafter
there is no 24-year patent_protection as gf alleges

all that is claimed in the619_patent is the caffeine_recovery_invention
to clearly understand this one must look at all the claims of619
there are only 6 claims and the broadest is independent claim 4 which we quote as showing the maximum patent coverage of this patent 4
a process for concentrating a dilute_aqueous_solution of caffein which comprises a. introducing the dilute_aqueous_solution into an evaporating_zone passing a stream of air or nitrogen through the aqueous_solution in the evaporating_zone for evaporating of water from the aqueous_solution and concentration of caffein in the aqueous_solution and withdrawing a concentrated_aqueous_solution from the evaporating_zone b. withdrawing the air or nitrogen laden with water_vapor from the evaporating_zone and cooling it for condensation of water and separating the water from the gas in a separating zone c. circulating the air or nitrogen between the evaporating_zone and the separating zone d. admixing the dilute_aqueous_solution of caffein and the air or nitrogen conveyed from the separating zone to the evaporating_zone e. passing the air or nitrogen laden with water_vapor and the admixture formed in step d in indirect_heat_exchange_relation between the evaporating_zone and the separating zone for cooling of the air or nitrogen laden with water_vapor for the condensation of step b and for heating said mixture for heating the aqueous_solution for evaporation of step a and
f. supplying additional_heat to the aqueous_solution for the evaporation
comparison of this claim 4 with claim 1 will show the general correspondence of claim 4 to steps d - j of claim 1 which further references carbon_dioxide in steps d and g and shows in steps a - c the source of the caffeine to be coffee which has been treated with moist supercritical carbon_dioxide making claim 1 more limited but still containing all the limitations of claim 4

since a patent is not infringed unless one or more claims are infringed and none of the619 claims are infringed by one practicing the decaffeination_process claimed in patent639 without more the619_patent did not cover the639 process and a patent *1283 thereon can not extend the protection granted by the now expired619_patent

as the619_patent states in its second paragraph previously quoted herein the recovery of the caffeine produced by the639_patent is not described in that patent which was then only the cip_application ser
no._3 64,190
furthermore by these statements in the619_patent the public was put on notice of the existence of the cip_applications pendency of the invention therein described and the probability of a future patent

other arguments
both parties briefs have made and debated and we have considered numerous arguments other than those we have discussed the majority of which we find irrelevant and all of which we find it unnecessary to comment on

conclusion
finding the judgment of the district_court that claims 1_and_4 of the639_patent are invalid for obviousness-type_double_patenting in view of claim 1 of the619_patent to have been in error essentially because of the distressing failure to adhere to firmly established and universally understood rules of claim_interpretation that judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings

costs
( a appellant requests us to vacate the award of costs on the double_patenting trial
we deny the request and leave it to the trial_court to review and decide in view of the outcome

( b costs on this appeal to appellant

reversed and remanded
