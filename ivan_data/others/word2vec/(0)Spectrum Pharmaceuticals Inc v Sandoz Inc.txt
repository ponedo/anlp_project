background
leucovorin is a compound used to ameliorate the toxic effects of methotrexate a chemotherapy treatment` methotrexate_rescue' ; to treat folate_deficiency ; and to enhance the efficacy of a 5-fluorouracil cancer treatment` 5-fu combination_therapy'
due to an asymmetric c6 carbon leucovorin may exist as a 50/50 mixture of two diastereoisomers the 6s and 6r isomers
the 6s diastereoisomer is also known as levoleucovorin or l-leucovorin and is the isomer with the desired biological activity

the ¡¬829_patent is directed to pharmaceutical_compositions of substantially pure_levoleucovorin
claim 1 of the ¡¬829_patent reads as follows *1330 1
a pharmaceutical_composition for therapeutic_use which consists essentially of a therapeutically effective amount sufficient for the treatment of human_beings for methotrexate_rescue or folate_deficiency of a pharmaceutically acceptable compound which is a 6s diastereoisomer selected from the group consisting of 6s leucovorin 5-formyl- 6s -tetrahydrofolic acid and pharmaceutically acceptable_salts and esters of 6s leucovorin ; wherein the compound consists of a mixture of 6s and 6r diastereoisomers and consists of at least 92 % by weight of the 6s diastereoisomer the balance of said compound consisting of the 6r diastereoisomer ; in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable_carrier
¡¬829_patent_col. 9_ll._55 -67 emphases added
the written description states that` a typical_daily_dose' of the 6s isomer for methotrexate_rescue would be` up to 150 mg [ ] e.g
[ ] in the range from 25_to_150 mg' and that` a typical_daily_dose [ for treating folate_deficiency ] for an adult human is generally in the range from 2_to_25 mg.' id
col. 5_ll._15 -19 21-24
claim 2 depends from claim 1 with the additional limitation that the composition` consists of greater than 95 % by weight of the 6s diastereoisomer'
id
col. 10_ll._1 -3 emphasis added

claim 5 of the ¡¬829_patent reads as follows 5
a pharmaceutical_composition for therapeutic_use for the treatment of human_beings comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable composition which is a 6s diastereoisomer selected from the group consisting of 6s leucovorin 5-formyl- 6s -tetrahydrofolic acid and pharmaceutically acceptable_salts and esters of 6s leucovorin wherein the composition consists of a mixture of 6s and 6r diastereoisomers and consists of at least about 92 % by weight of the 6s diastereoisomer the balance of said composition consisting of the 6r diastereoisomer ; and a pharmaceutically acceptable_carrier ; and
said composition_being of a quantity at least sufficient to provide multiple_doses of said mixture of 6s and 6r diastereoisomers in an amount of 2000 mg per dose
id
col. 10_ll._1 0-24 emphases added
claims 6-9 depend from claim 5 and contain additional limitations not at issue in this appeal

during prosecution of the application that became the ¡¬829_patent the examiner rejected the applications claims as anticipated by or obvious over an article disclosing an enzymatic synthesis technique by which 0.91 grams of l-leucovorin had been synthesized
j.a
4872-77 office_action detailing rejection over lilias rees et al. asymmetric reduction of dihydrofolate using dihydrofolate reductase and chiral boron-containing compounds 42_tetrahedron_117 -136 1986` rees'
the applicants responded by adding new claims including what later issued as claims 5-9 and by emphasizing the specific claim_limitations relating to quantities of the specified mixture which were allegedly not disclosed by the prior_art
j.a
4901-05
after a final office_action rejecting the claims the applicants appealed to the u.s._patent and trademark offices board of patent appeals and interferences` the board' again emphasizing that the quantity_limitations could not be met by rees
j.a
4971 4993-98
the patent eventually issued with the university of strathclyde listed as the assignee

*1331 spectrum as the exclusive licensee of the ¡¬829_patent holds the approved new drug application for a levoleucovorin formulation and accordingly listed the patent as claiming the drug_product in the u.s. food and drug administration` fda' publication approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations commonly known as the` orange book'
spectrums product fusilevthe_r is indicated for the three uses described earlier

sandoz submitted an anda in october 2011 seeking approval from the fda for a drug_product that will be imported in the form of single-use_vials with 175 mg or 250 mg of levoleucovorin indicated for methotrexate_rescue at doses of 7.5-75 mg per dose` the anda_product'
its anda contained a certification that the ¡¬829_patent was invalid or would not be infringed by the anda_product
see 21 u.s.c.¡± 355 j 2 a vii iv

after receiving notice of that certification spectrum filed a timely patent infringement suit in january 2012 alleging that sandozs anda submission infringed the ¡¬829_patent under 35 u.s.c.¡± 271 e 2
the asserted claims were directed to pharmaceutical_compositions comprising a mixture of 6s and 6r isomers with at least 92 % or 95 % of the 6s isomer
the patent discloses but does not claim a process for purifying the 6s isomer from a 50/50 mixture using a chiral auxiliary group

the district_court construed the term` said composition_being of a quantity at least sufficient to provide multiple_doses of said mixture of 6s and 6r diastereoisomers in an amount of 2000 mg per dose` as having its plain and ordinary meaning
spectrum_pharm. inc. v. sandoz_inc. no._212-cv-00111 2013_wl_6865692 at *18-20 d.nev
dec._31,_2013 emphases added
the court elaborated that the plain meaning required the composition to contain` enough of the 6s / 6r mixture to provide two or more_doses of at minimum 2000 mg per dose'
id

after construing the claims the district_court granted sandozs motion for summary_judgment of noninfringement of claims 5-9
summary_judgment_order at *1
comparing the product described in sandozs anda to the claims of the ¡¬ 829 patent the court found that because the individual vials will contain only up to 250 mg of levoleucovorin the approved product would not satisfy the claim_limitation of at least two doses of 2000 mg. id.at *5
the court also rejected spectrums argument that an aggregation of sandozs approved product-that is the total amount of levoleucovorin drug_product to be imported-would infringe the claims
id

the district_court further found that spectrum was precluded from asserting infringement under the doctrine of equivalents because of the inventors statements during prosecution
summary_judgment_order at *7-8
the court cited various instances in the prosecution history in which the applicants had distinguished rees by emphasizing that the application claims that issued as claims 5-9 had` more stringent quantity_limitations' than claim 1
id.at *7
as a result the court found` a clear and unmistakable_surrender of subject_matter covering pharmaceutical_composition quantities less than what is required to provide two or more_doses of at minimum 2000 mg per dose of the mixture'
id.at *8
because spectrum did not raise a genuine_issue of material_fact as to literal_infringement or infringement under the doctrine of equivalents of claims 5-9 the court granted summary_judgment of noninfringement of those claims

*1332 sandoz stipulated to infringement of claims 1_and_2 and the district_court subsequently conducted a bench_trial only on the validity of those claims
the court found that the prior_art disclosed i leucovorin as a mixture of 6r and 6s diastereoisomers ; ii that the therapeutic_usefulness of leucovorin derives wholly from the 6s isomer ; and iii a rationale for investigating a purified isomer product for use in 5-fu combination_therapy
trial_order at *6-8 *13-14
the court also found that preparations of purified 6s isomer by an enzymatic synthesis method and by separation methods had been publicly reported before the ¡¬829_patents priority_date
id.at *6-7
in particular the court analyzed two related prior_art references that disclosed a process for separating the diastereoisomers using the solubility differential of the 6s and 6r isomer salts i.e. fractional crystallization
see id.at *11-13 findings relating to donna b. cosulich diastereoisomers of leucovorin 74 j
am
chemical soc y 4215-16 1952 and u.s._patent 2,688,018 collectively` cosulich' or` the cosulich_references'

the district_court further found that the process taught by cosulich would have` invariably' produced a mixture containing the 6r isomer as an impurity and that the data in the cosulich_references demonstrated that dr. cosulich also obtained a highly pure 6s isomer_compound
trial_order at *10-12
the court concluded that those facts alone made the subject_matter of the claims prima facie obvious in light of the prior_art
the court also rejected spectrums argument that using the rees method would not have produced sufficient quantities of the 6s isomer because the applicants had submitted a declaration during prosecution stating that the reaction could have been scaled up to produce about 500 grams of the 6s isomer per year
id.at *15-16

the district_court then found that spectrum did not rebut the prima_facie_case of obviousness because it failed to prove any nexus between what was claimed and the so-called secondary factors much less prove a long-felt need or successful licensing
id.at *25-27
in particular the court found that the only` distinguishing feature' of the claims compared to the prior_art was` the small presence of the unwanted 6r isomer' and that spectrum did not prove a nexus between that amount and any secondary consideration
id.at *25
moreover as leucovorin was not used in 5-fu combination_therapy until much later than the claimed uses and thus the effect of the 6r isomer was not previously a concern the court found that no nexus was shown between the claims and the asserted long-felt need
id
the court found that even if there were a nexus and a long-felt need the invention would not have satisfied the need because substantially pure_levoleucovorin is clinically interchangeable with the prior_art leucovorin
id.at *26
the district_court also rejected spectrums proof of commercial success
trial_order at *26-27
the court thus concluded that the evidence as a whole showed that claims 1_and_2 were invalid as obvious
id
the district_court accordingly entered final judgment in favor of sandoz

spectrum timely appealed to this court
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

discussion
on appeal from a bench_trial we review a district_courts conclusions of law de novo and its findings of fact for clear *1333 error
golden blount inc. v. robert h. peterson co. 365_f.3d_1054 1058 fed.cir.2004
a factual finding is only clearly erroneous if despite some supporting evidence we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made
united states v. u.s. gypsum co. 333_u.s._364 395 68_s.ct._525 92_l.ed._746_(1948) ; see also polaroid corp. v. eastman kodak co. 789_f.2d_1556 1559 fed.cir.1986` the burden of overcoming the district_courts factual_findings is as it should be a heavy one
``

at the summary_judgment stage we review the grant of summary_judgment under the law of the regional circuit in which the district_court sits here the ninth_circuit
classen immunotherapies inc. v. elan pharm. inc. 786_f.3d_892 896 fed.cir.2015
applying the law of the ninth_circuit we review a district_courts grant of summary_judgment de novo
burke v. cty
of alameda 586_f.3d_725 730 9th cir.2009
summary judgment is appropriate when drawing all reasonable_inferences in favor of the nonmovant there is` no genuine dispute as to any material_fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law'
fed.r.civ.p
56 a ; see anderson v. liberty lobby inc. 477_u.s._242 255 106_s.ct._2505 91_l.ed.2d_202_(1986)

this appeal raises questions of validity and infringement but unlike most such appeals does not challenge the district_courts claim_construction
as we find no reason to disturb the district_courts claim_construction in these cases we will only address the issues raised

i. invalidity
we first address spectrums argument that the district_court erred in holding claims 1_and_2 of the ¡¬829_patent invalid as obvious

patents are presumed to be valid and overcoming that presumption requires clear and convincing_evidence
35 u.s.c.¡± 282 ; microsoft corp. v. i4i ltd. p'ship 564 u.s. -- -- 131_s.ct._2238 2242 180_l.ed.2d_131_(2011)
a patent claim is invalid as obvious if an alleged infringer proves that the differences between the claims and the prior_art are such that` the subject_matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary_skill in the art'
35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a 20061

obviousness is ultimately a conclusion of law premised on underlying findings of fact including the scope and content of the prior_art the differences between the claimed invention and the prior_art and the level of ordinary_skill in the pertinent art
ksr int l co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 427 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007) ; graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 17-18 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966)
`` the presence or absence of a motivation to combine references in an obviousness determination is a pure question of fact'
alza corp. v. mylan labs. 464_f.3d_1286 1289 fed.cir.2006
in addition to common knowledge or teachings in the prior_art itself a` design need or market pressure or other motivation' may provide a suggestion or motivation to combine prior_art elements in the manner claimed
rolls royce plc v. united techs corp. 603_f.3d_1325 1339 fed.cir.2010 ; accord ksr 550 u.s. at 420 127_s.ct._1727
these principles are relevant here

*1334 spectrum asserts that the district_court improperly used hindsight to provide a reason or motivation to modify the prior_art pure 6s isomer_compound to obtain a slightly impure_compound
even though one of skill in the art admittedly could have added some 6r isomer to contaminate the 100 % pure 6s isomer disclosed by rees to produce the claimed substantially pure_compound spectrum argues that none of the record evidence supplied a logical motivation to do so

sandoz responds that the district_court correctly found that one of skill would have been motivated to make substantially pure 6s leucovorin starting with the 50/50 mixture to have a more effective pharmaceutical treatment and would have reasonably expected to succeed in doing so
sandoz contends that it had no burden to show a motivation to contaminate the prior_art pure 6s isomer_compound because the courts analysis began with the 50/50 mixture and rejected spectrums arguments on the inoperability of the prior_art
moreover sandoz argues the court found no patentable difference between the claimed substantially pure_compound and the prior_art pure_compound which presented a prima_facie_case of obviousness that spectrum failed to rebut

most issues relating to purified diastereoisomers or enantiomers involve the question whether a pure resolved compound would have been obvious over the corresponding mixture
see e.g. aventis pharma deutschland gmbh v. lupin ltd. 499_f.3d_1293 1301-03 fed.cir.2007 ; see also sanofi-synthelabo v. apotex inc. 550_f.3d_1075 1086-90 fed.cir.2008 ; forest labs. inc. v. ivax pharm. inc. 501_f.3d_1263 1269 fed.cir.2007 ; in re adamson 47_ccpa_839 275_f.2d_952 953-54 1960 ; in re anthony 56_ccpa_1443 414_f.2d_1383 1386 1969
this case is unusual in involving a slightly different question namely whether a substantially pure_compound would have been obvious when both the 50/50 mixture and the pure_compound were known in the art
we agree with the district_court that the claimed substantially pure_compound would have been obvious over both the 50/50 mixture and the pure 6s isomer_compound in the prior_art

first the district_court did not clearly err in finding that one of skill would have been motivated to modify the prior_art 50/50 mixture to make the claimed mixture
if it is known that the desired activity all lies in one isomer surely it is better and there is generally motivation to try to obtain the purest compound possible
see aventis 499 f.3d at 1301` [ a ] purified compound is not always prima facie obvious over the mixture ;.. [ h ] owever if it is known that some desirable property of a mixture derives in whole or in part from a particular one of its components.. the purified compound is prima facie obvious over the mixture even without an explicit_teaching that the ingredient should be concentrated or purified`
a physician would not likely want to administer a contaminant or a less pure_material to a patient if one could use a pure_material
thus there is always in such cases a motivation to aim for obtaining a pure resolved material

conversely if the pure_material is known no reason has been shown why one would want to have an impure_material
although one may not be motivated to obtain an impure_material and in effect it therefore can be argued to have been nonobvious-which is spectrums position here that the 92-95 % pure_material was *1335 nonobvious over the known pure_material-that position despite its superficial appeal is not persuasive
as the district_court correctly decided because the desirable properties of the prior_art 50/50 mixture are attributable to only one component and the slightly impure mixture-one that contains the substantially pure 6s isomer in an amount of at least 92-95 % -has not been shown to possess unexpected advantages over the prior_art pure_material the less-than-pure_material and any others of similar concentration can not be found to have been nonobvious

we also agree with the district_court that given the 50/50 mixture there would have been a motivation to pursue the goal of obtaining either pure or the clinically interchangeable substantially pure 6s isomer
a person of skill knew that the desired activity of leucovorin came from the 6s isomer which therefore provided a motivation to purify the 6s isomer even without an explicit_teaching
although the claimed compounds are not 100 % pure they are described as` substantially pure' and as not patentably different from pure_material

the evidence showed that` numerous other research groups had responded to the motivation to obtain a pure isomer and were pursuing purified 6s leucovorin prior to the priority_date for the ¡¬829_patent' and as the district_court noted` [ i ] n short time many succeeded'
trial_order at *14-15 citation omitted
as in aventis here there was no need to find an express teaching to prove sufficient motivation to modify the prior_art to arrive at the claimed invention where various techniques to purify the isomers were reported in the art and importantly it was known that the 6s isomer alone provided the therapeutic effect

in the face of that evidence of obviousness spectrum did not provide any evidence of unexpected results for the substantially pure_compound as compared to the 50/50 mixture or the 100 % pure_compound
the district_court found that` clinical trials have established that purified 6s leucovorin and leucovorin are clinically interchangeable' and that one of skill in the art` would not have expected there to be any differences in the biological properties between purified 6s leucovorin with or without a small amount of 6r impurity.. because small amounts of the inactive isomer would not be noticeable in terms of therapeutic effects'
trial_order at *16

the district_court also found that the prior_art as a whole enabled one of skill in the art to make and use the claimed invention
spectrum asserts that the court made no explicit finding that cosulich was enabling and therefore nothing in the record showed that one of skill in the art had the means to separate the 6s and 6r isomers from a 50/50 mixture
accordingly spectrum argues because the ¡¬829_patent enabled one of skill in the art to produce viable quantities of the substantially pure 6s isomer the claims are directed to both the compound and the method of making that compound

sandoz responds that the district_court made factual_findings that the prior_art was enabling because multiple teams independently developed different methods for purifying a 6s isomer_compound around the time of the claimed invention and that the specification admits that the prior_art methods worked
sandoz also notes that the court acknowledged the evidence of failures to repeat the results of the method disclosed in cosulich but did not find that the purification could not be accomplished

regardless whether the cosulich_references were enabling or not the whole *1336 spectrum of prior_art available before the invention was made would have enabled one of skill in the art to make and use the claimed substantially pure leucovorin compound
we agree with the district_courts conclusion on that point

finally the district_court found that the objective_indicia did not rebut the prima_facie_case of obviousness
spectrum argues that the district_court erred by finding that despite the motivation to purify the prior_art 50/50 mixture and the knowledge in the art that the 6r isomer was undesirable there was not a long-felt but unmet_need
spectrum also asserts that the district_court improperly used evidence of later clinical studies
sandoz responds that such a need does not always exist whenever there is a motivation to modify the prior_art and that post-filing evidence is usually required to determine if the claimed invention satisfied the alleged long-felt need

we agree that the district_court did not clearly err in finding that there was no long-felt but unmet_need
moreover even if there were a long-felt need the district_court found that a purified 6s isomer_compound would not have satisfied that need because it was shown to be clinically interchangeable with the 50/50 mixture
id.at *18
the court also credited expert testimony including that of spectrums expert that the claimed substantially pure 6s isomer_compound` offers no meaningful difference' from the pure 6s isomer_compound
id.at *16
as a long-felt but unmet_need was the only indicium argued on appeal we agree with the district_court that spectrum did not provide evidence of objective_indicia of nonobviousness

we owe the district_courts factual_findings considerable deference on appeal and we see no clear_error based on the record before us
based on those findings we affirm the district_courts conclusion that sandoz proved by clear and convincing_evidence that claims 1_and_2 of the ¡¬829_patent are invalid as obvious

ii
noninfringement
we also address the district_courts finding that claims 5-9 of the ¡¬829_patent would not be infringed by sandozs anda_product
the key language at issue in claim 5 and by extension in dependent claims 6-9 is` said composition_being of a quantity at least sufficient to provide multiple_doses of said mixture of 6s and 6r diastereoisomers in an amount of 2000 mg per dose'
¡¬829_patent_col. 10_ll._1 0-24 emphasis added
based on its claim_construction the district_court found that sandozs anda_product in vials of 175 mg or 250 mg of levoleucovorin would not meet the limitation of at least two doses of 2000 mg each
the court also found that the patent applicant had explicitly disclaimed smaller dosage amounts during prosecution
the district_court therefore decided that no genuine_issue of material_fact on the infringement question had been raised finding that spectrum had not shown literal_infringement and was estopped from applying the doctrine of equivalents

under the framework of the hatch-waxman act the infringement inquiry focuses on a comparison of the asserted patent claims against the anda_product that is likely to be sold following fda_approval
warner-lambert co. v. apotex corp. 316_f.3d_1348 1365-66 fed.cir.2003 citing glaxo inc. v. novopharm ltd. 110_f.3d_1562 1567-68 fed.cir.1997
the burden of proving infringement by a preponderance of the evidence remains on the patentee
id
evaluating *1337 the grant of summary_judgment of noninfringement requires two steps 1 claim_construction where contested and 2 comparison of the properly construed claims to the accused product
abbott labs
v. sandoz inc. 566_f.3d_1282 1288 fed.cir.2009
the second step of the analysis is a question of fact
bai v. l & l wings inc. 160_f.3d_1350 1353 fed.cir.1998
as such it is amenable to summary_judgment where no reasonable factfinder could find that the accused product contains every claim_limitation or its equivalent
id
; see warner-jenkinson co. v. hilton davis chem co. 520_u.s._17 29 39_n._8 117_s.ct._1040 137_l.ed.2d_146_(1997)

even without literal_infringement a patentee may establish infringement under the doctrine of equivalents if an element of the accused product` performs substantially the same function in substantially the same way to obtain the same result as the claim_limitation'
pozen inc. v. par pharm. inc. 696_f.3d_1151 1167 fed.cir.2012 citation omitted

whether prosecution_history_estoppel applies and thus whether the doctrine of equivalents is available for a particular claim_limitation is a question of law reviewed de novo
intervet inc. v. merial ltd. 617_f.3d_1282 1290-91 fed.cir.2010
that situation arises when an applicant during prosecution either makes an argument evincing a` clear and unmistakable_surrender' of subject_matter elkay mfg co. v. ebco mfg co. 192_f.3d_973 979 fed.cir.1999 or narrows a claim` to avoid the prior_art or otherwise to address a specific concern.. that arguably would have rendered the claimed subject_matter unpatentable' warner-jenkinson 520 u.s. at 30-31 117_s.ct._1040
the applicant is then estopped from later invoking the doctrine of equivalents to recapture the surrendered subject_matter
festo corp. v. shoketsu kinzoku kogyo kabushiki co. 535_u.s._722 734 122_s.ct._1831 152_l.ed.2d_944_(2002)
the patentee bears the burden of rebutting the application of prosecution_history_estoppel
id.at 740-41 122_s.ct._1831

spectrum asserts that the claims do not require that the end product be distributed or administered in the packaged dosage
because sandoz stipulated to future importation of more than 10 grams of its product spectrum argues that such importation will literally infringe the claims
spectrum also asserts that the court erred in finding that prosecution_history_estoppel applied
spectrum insists that the applicants did not surrender coverage of aggregate quantities of the mixture
moreover spectrum argues claim 5 was added by amendment in addition to not in place of the original claims and was not amended to relinquish any claim scope

sandoz responds that the district_court rejected spectrums argument during claim_construction that the` 2000 mg per dose' limitation could be satisfied by multiple_doses as long as they added up to 4000 mg total because that ignored the` per dose' language in the claim
sandoz also contends that spectrum is barred from asserting infringement under the doctrine of equivalents because of the statements of disclaimer made during prosecution that were described as defining a significant aspect of the invention
even without the disclaimer sandoz argues that amendment-based estoppel would apply because those claims were added with the dosage_limitation to overcome an obviousness rejection based on rees

*1338 viewing the record in the light most favorable to spectrum and drawing all reasonable_inferences in its favor we do not find the evidence in the record sufficient to prove infringement
the product that is likely to be sold following fda_approval is what sandozs anda describes single-use_vials with 175 mg or 250 mg of substantially pure_levoleucovorin indicated only for methotrexate_rescue at doses between 7.5 mg and 75 mg per dose which would be far less than at least two doses of 2000 mg each
we discern no clear_error in the district_courts finding that sandozs approved product would not meet the dosage_claim_limitation and thus would not literally infringe claims 5-9

moreover by claim amendments and distinguishing statements on the prior_art during prosecution spectrum is now estopped from invoking the doctrine of equivalents to prove infringement
when submitting an amendment with the application claims that eventually issued as claims 5-9 the applicants asserted that the newly added claims` include specific limitations as to quantities of materials' and distinguished the prior_art by pointing to the` quantities of these specific mixtures specified in the claims'

4904-05
those claims were also added following an office_action rejecting the previous original claims as obvious in view of rees
the applicants again explicitly highlighted the significance of the dosage_limitation during an appeal to the board their brief stating that the claims` require a minimum of four grams' the` quantity_limitations set forth in the claims' which` define an aspect of the invention that is of great practical significance'
j.a
4996-97
the applicants unequivocally argued that rees which allegedly only produced experimental quantities` do [ es ] not teach suggest or otherwise render obvious the claimed compositions in the quantity specified` in the application claims that became claims 5-9
j.a
4998 emphasis in original
those statements are clear and unmistakable expressions of the applicants intent to surrender coverage of quantities of the compound in lower doses

accordingly we agree with the district_court that spectrum did not sufficiently raise a genuine_issue of material_fact as to infringement to defeat the motion for summary_judgment
the court did not clearly err in finding that spectrum failed to prove that the approved product would literally infringe claims 5-9
the court also did not err in concluding that spectrum was barred from invoking the doctrine of equivalents by prosecution_history_estoppel
the district_court thus did not err in granting summary_judgment of noninfringement

conclusion
we have considered the remaining arguments and conclude that they are without merit
for the foregoing reasons we conclude that the district_court did not err in holding that claims 1-2 of the ¡¬829_patent are invalid as obvious under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 and we therefore affirm that decision
we further conclude that the district_court did not err in holding that spectrum failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that sandozs anda_product would infringe claims 5-9 of the ¡¬829_patent and we also affirm that decision

affirmed
