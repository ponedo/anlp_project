opinion
bryson circuit_judge
sram corporation appeals from an order of the united_states_district_court for the northern_district of california granting sunrace_roots_enterprise_co. ltd. and sun_victory_trading_co. inc. collectively` sunrace' a declaratory_judgment of noninfringement of srams patent relating to bicycle_gear-shifting devices
because we conclude that the district_court erred in construing the term` shift_actuator' as used in srams patent we reverse and remand

i. sram owns u.s. patent no._4900,291` the ¡¬291_patent` and produces shift_actuators known as` twist-shifters' that allow a bicycle_rider to change gears by twisting a portion of the handlebar
a bicycle_gear-shifting system typically includes a shifter or` shift_actuator' at or near the handlebars a derailleur to control the chain and a control cable that connects the shifter and the derailleur

the ¡¬291_patent contains both method and apparatus_claims related to gear-shifting on multi-speed bicycles through the use of a shift_actuator that is designed to effect precise control over the movement of the derailleur
in a system that uses indexed shifting the shift_actuator moves a discrete amount to cause the derailleur to move the bicycle chain the precise distance necessary to effect a gear shift
one way that indexed shifting can be implemented in a twist-shifter is through the use of a cam_mechanism
in such a system the cylindrical_cam_member fits over the handlebar and the cam_operating_face consisting of peaks and valleys interacts with a cam pin as the shift_actuator is rotated
the apparatus_claims of the ¡¬291_patent include the limitation of a` handgrip_shift_actuator_cam_means' or a` handgrip_shift_actuator indexing cam_means' while the method_claims including claim 16 employ the term` shift_actuator' without reference to a cam

the written description of the ¡¬291_patent recites the objects of the invention
they include providing a derailleur shifting system with a shift_actuator that is rotatably mounted on the handlebar so that the bicycle_rider need not remove his hands from the handlebar to shift gears ; *1300 providing a derailleur shifting system having a handgrip_shift_actuator embodying a generally helical_cam that defines the derailleur_mechanism_movements ; providing a derailleur shifting system that compensates for` cumulative lost motion' the amount the shifter must move in order to take up any slack in the system before the derailleur begins to move in the derailleur_mechanism and its cable to enable precise index shifting ; and providing a derailleur shifting system that produces an optimum amount of overshift when down-shifting without requiring manual input to define that overshift
overshifting is` movement of the chain beyond the destination_sprocket and then back into alignment with the destination_sprocket' ¡¬291_patent col._1,_ll._52-55 ; in essence the cable is moved farther than necessary so that the derailleur is more easily aligned with the appropriate sprocket during down-shifting

the written description states that` [ a ] pplicant has found that for accurate index shifting substantially all of th [ e ] cumulative lost motion must first be taken up at the shift_actuator before the actual shift increment of travel between adjacent sprockets is applied during a down-shifting event
applicant is not aware of any specific consideration of this problem in the prior_art'
¡¬291_patent col._2,_ll._61-67
original claim 16 recited a method for down-shifting from a smaller sprocket to a larger_sprocket in which the movement of the shift_actuator first takes up the cumulative lost motion and then transfers the chain to the larger_sprocket

a
upon petitions from sram and a competitor shimano inc. the patent and trademark office` pto' reexamined the ¡¬291_patent
sram requested reexamination after prior_art not considered during the initial prosecution of the ¡¬291_patent was raised in litigation with shimano
in a june_10,_1997 office_action the examiner initially deemed claims 5_through_26 patentable but rejected claims 1_through_4
sram then submitted an amendment in which it sought to add claims 27_and_28 which were dependent on claim 16
claim 27 added the limitation` said shift_actuator being rotatably mounted on the bicycle_handlebar generally coaxially of the handlebar and engaged over the outside of the handlebar' and specified that the actuator was rotated as opposed to moved to take up the cumulative lost motion
claim 28 dependent on claim 27 added the limitation` said shift_actuator being mounted inboard of a fixed handgrip on an end of the handlebar'
in october 1997 the pto issued a notice of intent to issue reexamination certificate in which it stated that it had found claims 16 24 27 and 28 to be patentable

meanwhile shimano filed its own request for reexamination
the pto then consolidated the proceedings for the two reexamination requests
shimanos request alleged that original_claim 16. is extremely broad and can cover even conventional lever style shifters
all claim 16 requires is any kind of bicycle shifting mechanism which takes up slack in the device and then moves the derailleur from one sprocket to another
it is not even necessary to have a handlebar mounted or twist-grip_shifter
that requirement does not arise until claim 24 below.1

in response sram agreed that original_claim 16` does not require a handlebar mounted or twist-grip_shifter'
sram did not argue that the use of a cam distinguished *big_token__1301_claim_16__big_token from the prior_art
rather sram distinguished the prior_art_references based on the fact that they disclosed taking up slack in or during the first_climb or downshift
when discussing the apparatus_claims that included a` handgrip_shift_actuator_cam_means' sram took a different approach arguing that the prior_art_references did not disclose the` special cam configuration spelled out in the claim [ s ]'

in january 1999 the examiner issued an office_action rejecting claims 4-10 14-20 and 24-28
the examiner found claim 16 to be obvious in light of the french huret patent 1,499,803
sram then amended claim 16 adding the limitation that the shift_actuator is` rotatably mounted on a bicycle_handlebar generally coaxially of the handlebar said shift_actuator being mounted on and engaged over an outside of the handlebar_inboard of a fixed handgrip on an end of the handlebar'
sram requested that claims 27_and_28 be withdrawn noting that` claim 16 is amended to include the subject matter of claims 27_and_28'
sram maintained its request that the pto confirm the remaining claims including claim 24
with respect to claim 16 sram argued inter alia that huret was a defective reference and did not disclose a shift_actuator mounted inboard of a fixed handgrip on the handlebar
in the context of claim 5 sram argued that huret did not mention compensating for lost motion at all

the patent emerged from reexamination in 2000
claims 1-3 were cancelled ; claims 4 5 9-14 16 17 19 and 21-23 were ruled patentable as amended ; and dependent_claims 6-8 15 18 20 and 24 were determined to be patentable without amendment

claim 16 as found in the reexamination certificate provides

in a bicycle derailleur gear shifting system having a rear derailleur shifting mechanism a shift_actuator rotatably mounted on a bicycle_handlebar generally coaxially of the handlebar said shift_actuator being mounted on and engaged over an outside of the handlebar_inboard of a fixed handgrip on an end of the handlebar and control cable means operatively connecting said actuator to said shifting mechanism a method of performing down-shifting events from a relatively smaller origin freewheel sprocket to a relatively larger destination freewheel sprocket which comprises first [ moving ] rotating said shift_actuator a sufficient amount to take up substantially all of the cumulative lost motion in said derailleur_mechanism and said cable means ; and then [ moving ] rotating said shift_actuator a further amount [ to ] so as to move the bicycle chain at least substantially the distance between the centers of said origin and destination_sprockets

b
after the pto issued the ¡¬291 reexamination certificate sram sent a letter to sunrace asserting that sunrace was infringing the reexamined patent
on september 6 2000 sunrace filed a declaratory_judgment_action claiming that sunrace does not infringe the ¡¬291_patent and that the patent is invalid and unenforceable
sram counterclaimed for infringement of claims 16_and_20 of the reexamined_¡¬291_patent

the parties submitted competing constructions of the terms` shift_actuator' from claim 16 and` moving said shift_actuator back' from claim 20
the district_court issued an order on july_26,_2001 construing the two terms
the court concluded that the plain and ordinary *1302 meaning of the term` shift_actuator' is` a mechanism that controls the changing of gears'
in light of the specification and prosecution_history however the district_court ruled that the term` shift_actuator' as used in the ¡¬291_patent is limited to` a mechanism for controlling the changing of gears that contains a cam configured with a series of lobes and valleys that rotates so as to engage a cam follower'

the parties acknowledged that the specification contained no explicit definition of the term` shift_actuator'
the court concluded however that` the specification reveals that the cam is truly integral to the invention' and that` each [ embodiment of the invention ] uses a cam_operating_face with valleys and detents'
the court further stated that the specification does not` even hint that the invention might be embodied in a structure that does not use a cam'
with respect to the prosecution_history the court acknowledged that when the pto required sram to add the mounting limitation on the handlebar to claim 16 it did not require sram to explicitly specify a cam in the claim_language
nevertheless the court held that the prosecution_history indicated that sram and the examiner considered the term` shift_actuator' to require the use of a cam_mechanism

on the stipulation of the parties that the accused devices do not infringe claim 16 under the district_courts claim_construction the district_court entered judgment of noninfringement
the court also construed the term` moving back' in claim 20 but sram has not appealed from the district_courts construction of that term
the courts construction of claim 20 is therefore not at issue in this appeal

ii
sram argues that the district_court erred in its construction of the term` shift_actuator' in claim 16 of the reexamined_¡¬291_patent and that the appropriate_construction of the term is` a mechanism that controls the changing of gears'
sram contends that the district_court did not give enough weight to the ordinary_meaning of the term that it disregarded the claim_differentiation doctrine that it improperly read limitations from the specification into the claim and that it ignored the distinction between the apparatus and method_claims of the patent

a
we have repeatedly stated that claim_terms must be given their ordinary and accustomed_meaning unless the patent expresses an intention to impart novel meaning to claim_terms
see york prods. inc. v. central tractor farm & family ctr. 99_f.3d_1568 1572 fed.cir.1996
`` generally speaking we indulge aheavy_presumption that a claim_term carries its ordinary and customary meaning'
ccs_fitness inc. v. brunswick corp. 288_f.3d_1359 1366 fed.cir.2002
both parties and the district_court agreed that the ordinary_meaning of` shift_actuator' to one of ordinary skill in the art is` a mechanism that controls the changing of gears'
moreover the parties agree that the method of claim 16 can be practiced without the use of a cam
the question in this case is whether the presumption that the ordinary_meaning was intended has been overcome

the doctrine of claim_differentiation undermines sunraces argument that the term` shift_actuator' should be defined more narrowly than its ordinary_meaning would suggest
`` while we recognize that the doctrine of claim_differentiation is not a hard and fast rule of construction it does create a presumption that each claim in a patent has a different_scope'
comark communications inc. v. harris corp. 156_f.3d_1182 1187 fed.cir.1998
see also amgen inc. v. hoechst marion roussel *1303 inc. 314_f.3d_1313 1326 fed.cir.2003` our court has made clear that when a patent claimdoes not contain a certain limitation and another claim does that limitation can not be read into the former claim in determining either validity or infringement
...
there is a rebuttable presumption that different claims are of different_scope`
that presumption is especially strong when the limitation in dispute is the only meaningful difference between an independent and dependent_claim and one party is urging that the limitation in the dependent_claim should be read into the independent_claim
ecolab inc. v. paraclipse inc. 285_f.3d_1362 1375 fed.cir.2002

reference to other claims supports the conclusion that the term` shift_actuator' as used in the ¡¬291_patent is not limited to a device that uses a cam
dependent claim 24 adds to independent_claim 16 only the clause` wherein said shift_actuator comprises cam_means rotatably mounted on the bicycle_handlebar generally coaxially of the handlebar'
because amended claim 16 already provides that the shift_actuator must be rotatably mounted on the handlebar generally coaxially of the handlebar dependent_claim 24 simply adds the structural limitation of a cam_means
this is therefore a strong case for inferring that the limitation added by the dependent_claim should not be read into the independent_claim
if the` shift_actuator' of claim 16 were required to include a cam_means claim 24 would be rendered entirely redundant

sunrace responds that sram created the redundancy through its amendment of claim 16 during reexamination
because sunrace believes that all shift_actuators of the ¡¬291_patent must employ a cam it argues that the only difference between claim 24 and original_claim 16 was the language` rotatably mounted on the bicycle_handlebar generally coaxially of the handlebar'
when sram added that limitation to claim 16 sunrace argues the effect of the amendment was to narrow the scope of amended claim 16 to make it the same as dependent_claim 24

we have a different understanding of the evolution of the claims
taking into account the amendment that added the handgrip mounting limitations through claims 27_and_28 and the continued presence of claim 24 it appears that original_claim 16 used the term` shift_actuator' consistently with its ordinary_meaning and that the term was not defined as limited to a device mounted on the handlebars or incorporating a cam
at that point claim 27 differed from original_claim 16 solely through the` rotatably mounted on the bicycle_handlebar' limitation while claim 24 differed from original_claim 16 both by the` rotatably mounted on the bicycle_handlebar' limitation and by the requirement of a cam_means

if as sunrace contends the shift_actuators in claim 16 and thus in claim 27 were already limited to those containing a cam there would have been no difference between claim 24 and claim 27
yet the patent examiner deemed both claim 24 and claim 27 to be patentable
had sram understood the term` shift_actuator' to be limited to devices containing a cam one would assume that sram would have requested that claim 24 be cancelled as it did in the case of claims 27_and_28 once claim 16 was amended
instead sram continued to prosecute claim 24 and the examiner found it patentable even after claim 16 was amended to include the structural mounting limitation of the shift_actuator on the handlebar
we infer from that course of events that both sram and the examiner regarded claim 24 as adding something-the cam_means-to the limitations found in claim 16 as amended in reexamination

*1304 b
we next look to the specification to determine whether sunrace has satisfied its burden of showing that sram meant to define the term` shift_actuator' more restrictively than is suggested by its ordinary_meaning and by the doctrine of claim_differentiation
a` claim_term will not receive its ordinary_meaning if the patentee acted as his own lexicographer and clearly set forth a definition of the disputed claim_term' in the specification
ccs_fitness 288 f.3d at 1362
see also renishaw plc v. marposs societa per azioni 158_f.3d_1243 1249 fed.cir.1998` the patentees lexicography must of course appearwith reasonable clarity deliberateness and precision before it can affect the claim`
we have recently held that` claim_terms take on their ordinary and accustomed_meanings unless the patentee demonstrated an intent to deviate from the ordinary and accustomed_meaning of a claim_term by redefining the term or by characterizing the invention in the intrinsic record using words or expressions of manifest exclusion or restriction representing a clear_disavowal of claim scope'
teleflex inc. v. ficosa n. am corp. 299_f.3d_1313 1327 fed.cir.2002

we believe the district_court erred in relying on various statements in the written description to conclude that the term_shift_actuator should be limited to a device containing the cam_structure of the preferred_embodiment
the district_court focused on the following statements in the written description 1 one of the objects of the invention is` to provide a bicycle derailleur shifting system having a handgrip_shift_actuator embodying a generally helical_cam which defines the derailleur_mechanism_movements' ¡¬ 291 patent col._3,_ll._32-36 ; 2` another important part of the invention is.. the programming of the cam_operating_face of the handgrip_shift_actuators of the invention to accurately achieve such shifting limits for each available derailleur system' id. col._6,_ll._20-26 ; 3` each handgrip_shift_actuator contains a generally cylindrical_cam_member having a generally helical_operating_face configured with a plurality of spaced detents or valleys with a cam peak or lobe between each pair of adjacent detents' id. col._4,_ll._49-53 ; and 4` a rotary cam member 74 having a generally helical_operating_face is the heart of the rear handgrip_shift_actuator' id. col._9,_ll._64-66
the district_court determined that those statements in connection with the absence of any disclosure of a shift_actuator other than one using a cam_mechanism had the effect of limiting the definition of shift_actuator to a device that includes a cam

the quoted statements do not sufficiently evidence an intention to depart from the ordinary_meaning of` shift_actuator'
the first two statements simply detail some of the goals of the invention that are achieved by some of the apparatus_claims
those are not the only goals of the invention however
some of the recited goals relate to compensating for lost motion and providing automatic overshift capabilities and do not specifically address the use of cams
the third and fourth statements are more problematic for sram but they still do not define the term_shift_actuator nor do they constitute expressions of clear exclusion
while sunrace would characterize the statement that every handgrip_shift_actuator contains a cam member as definitional we believe it is more properly characterized as descriptive of the preferred_embodiments and the structure recited in the apparatus_claims
we note that original_claim 16 unlike claim 1 was not limited to handgrip_shift_actuators but simply recited a shift_actuator as the structural element
it seems that the applicant contemplated a broad class of shift_actuators containing a subcategory of handgrip_shift_actuators which in turn contained a subcategory *1305 of handgrip_shift_actuators employing a cam_mechanism
accordingly the statements from the written description do not narrow the ordinary definition of the term` shift_actuator'

the district_court regarded this case as analogous to atd corp. v. lydall inc. 159_f.3d_534_(fed.cir.1998) and scimed life systems inc. v. advanced cardiovascular systems inc. 242_f.3d_1337_(fed.cir.2001) in which claim_language was limited based on a feature that was described as essential to the invention
it is true that this court has narrowly construed claim_terms in light of the preferred_embodiment when the patent has described the preferred_embodiment as the invention itself
see e.g. wang labs. inc. v. am
online inc. 197_f.3d_1377_(fed.cir.1999)
the written description of the ¡¬291_patent however does not state that the cam is the actual invention itself
instead it recites that in the context of the preferred_embodiments of the shifting system apparatus the cam is the heart of the handgrip_shift_actuator
moreover this is not a case in which a feature was described in the written description as critical but was never explicitly listed in the claim_language suggesting that the relevant structure in the claims should be narrowly construed as having that feature
rather in this case the cam feature was explicitly included as an element in numerous claims but not in the claim in suit
because many of the claims of the ¡¬291_patent are explicitly directed to a shift_actuator with a cam we need not construe the term` shift_actuator' to be limited to one consisting of a cam in order to give effect to the language in the specification extolling the significance of the cam

we recognize that the written description does not explicitly address the claimed methods
in fact the written description focuses exclusively on the gear shifting systems themselves
the complete absence of any discussion of the claimed method weakens srams argument that the statements in the written description regarding the cam appear only in the context of the description of the apparatuses
yet nothing in the written description indicates that the invention is exclusively directed toward cams or suggests that systems not employing cams are outside the scope of the invention
thus while it is clear that the patentee was primarily focused on an embodiment of his invention using a cam nothing in the patent limits the claims to that embodiment

other cases in which we have found that the specification limited the scope of the claims have elements that are absent here
for example the scimed patent distinguished prior_art on the basis that it did not have the relevant features
242 f.3d at 1343-44
in o.i
corp. v. tekmar co. 115_f.3d_1576_(fed.cir.1997) the court narrowed a term to a particular structural element when all the disclosed embodiments contained that element
as in scimed the written description expressly distinguished the prior_art on the ground that the prior_art did not incorporate that element
o.i
corp. 115 f.3d at 1581-82
as noted there is no such language of exclusion in the specification of the ¡¬291_patent

our case law makes clear that while` [ a ] n accused infringer may overcome th [ e ]heavy_presumption [ of ordinary_meaning ] and narrow a claim_terms ordinary_meaning [ ] he can not do so simply by pointing to the preferred_embodiment or other structures or steps disclosed in the specification or prosecution_history'
ccs_fitness 288 f.3d at 1362
`` an applicant is not required to describe in the specification every conceivable and possible future embodiment of his invention'
rexnord corp. v. laitram corp. 274_f.3d_1336 1344 fed.cir.2001
*1306` whether an invention is fairly claimed more broadly than thepreferred_embodiment in the specification is a question specific to the content of the specification the context in which the embodiment is described the prosecution_history and if appropriate the prior_art'
teleflex 299 f.3d at 1327 quoting wang labs. 197 f.3d at 1383
in this case those considerations lead us to conclude that the term` shift_actuator' is not limited to a device with a cam

c. we next examine the prosecution_history to assess whether it confirms that the term` shift_actuator' should be construed in a manner consistent with its ordinary_meaning
`` although [ it ] is correct that the prosecution_history is always relevant to claim_construction it is also true that the prosecution_history may not be used to infer the intentional narrowing of a claim absent the applicants clear_disavowal of claim coverage'
amgen 314 f.3d at 1327
to be given effect such a disclaimer must be` clear and unmistakable'
omega eng g inc. v. raytek corp. 334_f.3d_1314 1325 fed.cir.2003

the district_court cited several instances in which it regarded sram or the examiner as having characterized claim 16 as encompassing a cam_structure
the instances relied upon by the district_court however are not clear statements of disclaimer
first the court alluded to srams request for reexamination which describes the ¡¬291_patent as` involving an actuator comprising a cylindric cam member 74 rotary on the outside of the handlebar and axially slidable relative to the handlebar' and refers to` actuator 66' which contains a cam_structure
the cited statement however was not specific to method claim 16 and in fact appears from its context to relate to the apparatus_claims
a later paragraph in the request for reexamination addresses the method of operation of the gear-shifting system ; that paragraph does not refer to a cam in the discussion of the claimed method

second the court pointed to the examiners june_20,_1997 office_action
the examiner stated that claims 5_through_26 were allowable over the prior_art because` [ t ] hese claims comprise what the examiner considers to befine tuning features wherein specific embodiments areconfigured so as to provide a more absolute control of the derailleur gear shifting system for a bicycle existing thentofore'
the district_court considered that statement to be` plainly inconsistent with srams view that claim 16 embraces broadly a method of shifting gears unconstrained by any structural limitations requiring the use of a cam'
we disagree
that statement is merely the examiners general reason for allowance of 21 of the claims in the patent including both apparatus_claims and method_claims
various aspects of the 21 claims including taking up cumulative motion and providing for overshifting would likely allow for more control of the shifting system and would not necessarily be limited to a cam_mechanism
the examiners remarks thus do not indicate that the examiner believed the term` shift_actuator' was limited to a device having a cam_mechanism
to the contrary as we have noted the fact that the examiner confirmed dependent_claim 24 which added the cam_means to independent_claim 16 supports the contrary conclusion

third the court relied on srams statements addressing the patentability of claims 27_and_28
as previously explained prior to the reexamination amendment of claim 16 sram submitted an amendment in which it sought to add two claims dependent on claim 16-claims 27_and_28 -that specified the structural mounting limitations *1307 now found in amended clam 16
according to the court` [ i ] n asserting the patentability of these claims sram directed the examiner to portions of the patent specification describing the cam_structure'

sram pointed to the discussion of the cam_means of the preferred_embodiment however not to define the term_shift_actuator nor to distinguish the shift_actuators in the claims from prior_art shift_actuators that lacked cams
rather sram did so to show that the written description requirement was satisfied and that no new matter was being introduced with the amendment that added claims 27_and_28
sram stated that` [ f ] or disclosure of these limitations the examiner is referred to the description of theinboard handgrip shift actuators starting in line 15 of column 30 of the ¡¬291_patent particularly including the following statements'
the discussion of the preferred_embodiment incorporates the limitations that sram sought to include through the addition of claims 27_and_28 such as having the shift_actuator mounted inboard on the fixed handgrip of a handlebar and rotatably mounted to take up cumulative lost motion in the derailleur_mechanism
however the disclosure of these features in an embodiment employing a cam does not limit those claims to a cam
it appears that the features may also be present in actuators lacking a cam_mechanism

we agree with the district_court that srams statements addressing the huret reference and responding to shimanos arguments against patentability do not provide the requisite disclaimer
in fact other portions of the prosecution_history confirm that sram did not argue for the patentability of claim 16 based on the absence of a cam_means from the prior_art even though it made that argument for several apparatus_claims
for example srams submission to the pto in response to shimanos request for reexamination never mentions a cam but explains that the method of claim 16 was not previously disclosed because the prior_art_references only` mention [ ] slack take-up in or during the first_climb or first downshift'
in the may_17,_1999 amendment and response to the pto sram argued that other prior_art_references did not` show [ ] a shift_actuator mounted inboard of a fixed handgrip on the handlebar'
moreover sram concurred with shimanos statement in its request for reexamination that the shift_actuator of original_claim 16` does not require a handlebar mounted or twist-shifter'
if sram was not even arguing to limit the shift_actuator to a handlebar mounted shifter or twist-grip_shifter it was not putting the public on notice that the shift_actuators were limited to those employing a cam_mechanism to effect the twist shift

d. sunrace points to extrinsic evidence to support the district_courts construction including the deposition testimony of the inventor in previous litigation with shimano involving the ¡¬291_patent
in this case however the intrinsic_evidence resolves any ambiguity about the appropriate_construction of` shift_actuator' and therefore consideration of extrinsic evidence is inappropriate
digital biometrics inc. v. identix inc. 149_f.3d_1335 1344 fed.cir.1998

in sum while we commend the district_court for its thorough analysis of the difficult claim_construction issue presented by this case we conclude that the courts claim_construction was unduly restrictive
although this is a close case we conclude that the ordinary_meaning of the term` shift_actuator' controls because neither the specification nor the prosecution_history clearly defines the shift_actuator as *1308 including a cam or disclaims a shift_actuator that does not include a cam
because the intrinsic_evidence does not clearly narrow the term` shift_actuator' to a device containing a cam the district_court erred by construing the term in that manner
accordingly we reverse the district_courts claim_construction of the term` shift_actuator' in claim 16 and remand the case to the district_court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion

reversed and remanded
