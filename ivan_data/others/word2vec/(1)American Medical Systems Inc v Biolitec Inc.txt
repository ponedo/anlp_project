in this patent infringement action plaintiffs american medical systems inc. and laserscope appeal an order granting summary_judgment of noninfringement to defendant biolitec inc
the patent in suit laserscopes u.s._patent_no._6986,764` the ¡¬764_patent` is entitled` method and system for photoselective vaporization of the prostate and other tissue'
it claims various_methods and devices for vaporizing tissue by using laser_radiation
the district_court based its summary_judgment order on its conclusion that biolitecs accused device does not perform` photoselective_vaporization of tissue' a term that is contained only in the preambles of the asserted_claims
because we conclude that the disputed preamble_term does not limit the asserted_claims we reverse and remand

*1356 i
the invention of the ¡¬764_patent can be used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia` bph' a condition in which growth of the prostate gland restricts the passage of urine out of the bladder and through the urethra
vaporization or ablation of some of the prostate_tissue reduces the size of the prostate and can relieve bladder outlet obstructions
as described in the patent this type of bph_treatment generally involves the insertion of a cytoscope into the urethra the provision of an irrigant such as sterile water and the application of high-intensity laser_radiation to the target_tissue by means of an optical_fiber

according to the specification of the ¡¬764_patent prior_art tissue_vaporization systems were inefficient when used with continuous irrigation and they frequently caused side effects including residual tissue coagulation i.e. the generation of a layer of thermally denatured tissue which led to swelling transient urinary retention and infection
¡¬764_patent col._2,_ll._33-41
the ineffectiveness of the prior_art systems was due in part to their use of longer_wavelengths of laser_radiation such as 2100_or_1064 nanometers` nm'
at 2100 nm the specification explains laser_radiation is` strongly absorbed by water in the prostate_tissue' and there is` essentially no selective_absorption by blood'
when combined with the pulse energies and pulse durations used in the prior_art devices the use of radiation of that wavelength led to violent tissue disruption and` poor hemostasis' stoppage of bleeding
id. col._2,_ll._17-20 28-32
at 1064 nm the radiation is hemostatic when used at high power levels but has low_absorption in blood and prostate_tissue that` leads to inefficient_ablation and a large residual layer of thermally denatured tissue several millimeters thick'
id. col._2,_ll._36-38
by contrast the specification explains laser_radiation at a wavelength of 532 nm` is selectively absorbed by blood leading to good_hemostasis' and when sufficient power is used at that wavelength the process leaves behind a layer of denatured tissue less than 1 millimeter thick which reduces swelling and painful urination
id. col._2,_ll._49-56
the specification adds however that even when using a wavelength of 532 nm prior_art techniques were inefficient and caused significant_residual_coagulation
id. col._2,_ll._59-65

the inventors of the ¡¬764_patent determined that the use of high` volumetric_power_density' i.e. a high amount of energy delivered to a given volume of tissue would result in increased vaporization_efficiency while minimizing residual_coagulation
the patent is directed to various_methods and devices for achieving high_volumetric_power_density for tissue_vaporization by manipulating variables such as wavelength output_power beam quality irrigant composition and distance between the optical_fiber and the tissue
those variables in turn affect the resulting irradiance level spot_size and absorption depth

claim 31 is representative of the method_claims
it recites

a method for photoselective_vaporization of tissue comprising delivering laser_radiation to a treatment_area on the tissue the laser_radiation having a wave-length and having irradiance in the treatment_area sufficient to cause vaporization of a substantially greater_volume of tissue than a volume of residual_coagulated_tissue caused by the laser_radiation wherein the delivered laser_radiation has an average_irradiance in the treatment_area greater than 10 kilowatts/cm 2 in a spot_size at least 0.big_token__05_mm_2__big_token
the apparatus_claims are generally similar except that they also recite a laser and an endoscope having an optical_fiber for delivering the laser_radiation

*1357 most of the independent_claims do not specify a maximum or minimum wavelength for the laser_radiation used in the claimed methods or by the claimed apparatus although several of them have dependent_claims specifying that` the laser_radiation has a wavelength in a range from about 650 to about 200 nm'
the other independent_claims expressly recite` laser_radiation having a wavelength in a range of about 200 nm to about 650 nm'
with the exception of claims 1_and_16 all of the independent_claims contain limitations requiring that the laser_radiation have a` wavelength and irradiance in the treatment_area sufficient to cause vaporization of a substantially greater_volume of tissue than a volume of residual_coagulated_tissue caused by the laser_radiation'
claim 1 requires that the laser_radiation be` absorbed substantially completely by the tissue within about 1 mm of the surface' and that it have` average_irradiance in the treatment_area greater than 10 kilowatts/cm 2 in a spot_size at least about 0.big_token__05_mm_2__big_token'
claim 16 requires the delivery of laser_radiation and a flow of transparent liquid irrigant with the laser` causing vaporization of a volume of tissue greater than a volume of residual_coagulation of tissue and having irradiance in the treatment_area greater than 10 kilowatts/cm 2 in a spot_size at least about 0.big_token__05_mm_2__big_token'

the plaintiffs filed suit against biolitec in the united_states_district_court for the district of massachusetts alleging that biolitecs evolve tm laser_system and method of use infringed a number of the claims of the ¡¬764_patent
the accused product is a laser-powered tissue ablation system that uses radiation having a wavelength of 980 nm
it includes an optical_fiber probe for administering the radiation by direct_contact with the target_tissue

following a markman hearing the district_court issued an order construing several key terms in the asserted_claims
am
med sys. inc. v. biolitec inc. 569_f.supp.2d_313 d.mass.2008
most sharply disputed were the terms in the preambles of the asserted_claims` a method for photoselective_vaporization of tissue' and` an apparatus for photoselective_vaporization of tissue'
the plaintiffs argued that the preamble_language particularly the phrase` photoselective_vaporization' simply describes the invention as a whole and should not be construed as a limitation of any of the asserted_claims
the district_court however ruled that the repeated use of the phrase` photoselective_vaporization' in the specification and claims indicated that` photoselective_vaporization' is a` fundamental characteristic' of the invention albeit not its central_innovative_feature
id.at 320-22
the court found support for that conclusion in the patents discussion of the prior_art
in particular the court relied on the patents criticism of earlier_laser_systems that used longer_wavelengths of 2100 nm or 1064 nm
those systems according to the specification produced` low' or` no' selective_absorption of the radiation by blood and tissue ; by contrast to those systems the specification praised a prior_art system that used a shorter wavelength of 532 nm that was` selectively absorbed by blood'
id.at 321
accordingly the court construed the term` photoselective_vaporization' to mean` using a wavelength that is highly absorptive in the tissue while being absorbed only to a negligible_degree by water or other_irrigant'
id.at 327

in light of the district_courts claim_construction ruling biolitec moved for summary_judgment of noninfringement asserting that its evolve tm laser_system operated at a wavelength 980 nm at which the energy is absorbed to more than` a negligible_degree by water or other_irrigant'
the district_court granted biolitecs motion
am
med sys. inc. v. biolitec inc. 603_f.supp.2d_251 d.mass.2009
the *1358 court began by noting certain undisputed facts concerning the properties of 980 nm_laser_light as in the accused product as compared with 532 nm_laser_light the wavelength of the ¡¬764_patents preferred and commercial embodiment
for example the absorption_coefficient of 980 nm_laser_energy in water is 0.43 whereas the absorption_coefficient of 532 nm_laser_energy in water is only 0.00036 ; and 4.2 % of 980 nm_laser_energy is absorbed by water at a distance of 1 mm from prostate_tissue whereas only 0.004 % of 532 nm_laser_energy is absorbed by water at that distance
id.at 255-56
the district_court also observed that biolitecs accused device operates by placing the device in direct_contact with the target_tissue so as to prevent absorption of the energy by the water irrigant
in light of those facts the court concluded that` [ w ] hen compared to 532 nm_laser_light 980 nm_laser_light is more than negligibly absorbed by the water irrigant' and thus did not satisfy the` photoselective_vaporization' limitation of the ¡¬764_patent as the district_court construed it
id.at 256
the court therefore held that biolitecs accused device did not literally infringe the ¡¬ 764 patent

the district_court also addressed the issue of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
the court concluded that the` function-way-result' test was ill-suited to evaluating the patent in suit but it held that under the` all limitations' rule and the corollary` specific exclusion' principle developed by this court biolitecs device did not infringe the ¡¬764_patent by equivalents
am
med
sys. 603 f.supp.2d at 257-58

on appeal the plaintiffs contend that 1 the term` photoselective_vaporization' in the preamble of each of the asserted_claims should not be construed as a claim_limitation ; 2 if` photoselective_vaporization' is a limitation on the claims the district_court erred in construing that term to require a wavelength that is` absorbed only to a negligible_degree by water or other_irrigant' ; and 3 if the district_courts claim_construction is correct the district_court erred in its infringement analysis in several respects
we conclude that the preamble_phrase` photoselective_vaporization of tissue' and particularly the descriptor` photoselective' does not limit the claims of the ¡¬764_patent
therefore we need not address the plaintiffs remaining arguments
because the district_courts grant of summary_judgment was predicated entirely on its conclusion that biolitecs accused device` does not violate thephotoselective_vaporization claim_limitation in the ¡¬764_patent as construed in the markman order' am
med
sys. 603 f.supp.2d at 256 we reverse and remand for further_proceedings

ii
whether to treat a preamble_term as a claim_limitation is` determined on the facts of each case in light of the claim as a whole and the invention described in the patent'
storage_tech corp. v. cisco sys. inc. 329_f.3d_823 831 fed.cir.2003
while there is no simple test for determining when a preamble limits claim scope we have set forth some general principles to guide that inquiry
`` generally' we have said` the preamble does not limit the claims'
allen eng g corp. v. bartell indus. inc. 299_f.3d_1336 1346 fed.cir.2002
nonetheless the preamble may be construed as limiting` if it recites essential_structure or steps or if it isnecessary to give life meaning and vitality to the claim'
catalina_mktg_. int l inc. v. coolsavings.com inc. 289_f.3d_801 808 fed.cir.2002 quoting pitney_bowes inc. v. hewlett-packard_co. 182_f.3d_1298 1305 fed.cir.1999
a preamble is not regarded as limiting however` when the claim_body describes a structurally complete_invention such that *1359 deletion of the preamble_phrase does not affect the structure or steps of the claimed invention'
catalina 289 f.3d at 809
if the preamble` is reasonably susceptible to being construed to be merely duplicative of the limitations in the body of the claim and was not clearly added to overcome a [ prior_art ] rejection we do not construe it to be a separate limitation'
symantec corp. v. computer assocs
int l inc. 522_f.3d_1279 1288-89 fed.cir.2008
we have held that the preamble has no separate limiting effect if for example` the preamble merely gives a descriptive_name to the set of limitations in the body of the claim that completely set forth the invention'
ims tech. inc. v. haas automation inc. 206_f.3d_1422 1434-35 fed.cir.2000

in light of those principles we conclude that the preamble_language in the asserted_claims of the ¡¬764_patent does not constitute a limitation of the claims
more specifically we reject the district_courts suggestion implicit in its claim_construction and infringement analyses that the preamble descriptor` photoselective' limits the claims to a particular albeit unspecified range of wavelengths at which laser_radiation is` absorbed only to a negligible_degree by water or other_irrigant'

first there is no suggestion in the prosecution_history of the ¡¬764_patent that the inventors added the phrase` photoselective_vaporization' in order to distinguish their invention from the prior_art
rather the examiners primary reason for approval was the claims use of high_power_densities to vaporize tissue without causing significant residual tissue damage

second contrary to biolitecs argument the preamble_term` photoselective_vaporization of tissue' does not provide a necessary antecedent basis for the term` the tissue' in the bodies of each of the independent_claims
the preambles reference to` vaporization of tissue' does not specify a particular type or location of tissue being treated
nor does the generic term` tissue' in the preamble provide any` context essential to understand [ ing ]' the meaning of` the tissue' in the body of each claim
seachange int l inc. v. c-cor inc. 413_f.3d_1361 1376 fed.cir.2005
thus the claim drafters did not rely on the preamble_language to define or refine the scope of the asserted_claims
see catalina 289 f.3d at 808` [ d ] ependence on a particular disputed preamble_phrase for antecedent basis may limit claim scope because it indicates a reliance on both the preamble and claim_body to define the claimed invention
``

third and most importantly the descriptor` photoselective' does not embody an essential component of the invention
instead the term` photoselective_vaporization' is simply a descriptive_name for the invention that is fully set forth in the bodies of the claims
see storage_tech. 329 f.3d at 831 preamble_term` policy caching method' did not limit claims because it served only as a` convenient label for the invention as a whole'
the bodies of the asserted_apparatus_claims claims 63-64 describe a structurally complete device including a laser adapted to deliver` radiation at a wavelength and irradiance.. sufficient to cause [ tissue ] vaporization [ ]'
the bodies of those claims identify the covered wavelengths by function` sufficient to cause vaporization' and nothing in the claim_language suggests that the term` photoselective' further limits those wavelengths
the inference that the asserted_apparatus_claims do not require the use of energy of a particular_wavelength is considerably strengthened by the fact that a number of other apparatus_claims claims 59-big_token__62_and_67__big_token -74 which contain the same disputed preamble_language limit the wavelength of the radiation to the range from` about 200 nm to about 650 nm'
if the term` photoselective' *1360 were deemed independently limiting it would either be redundant or in conflict with the specific_wavelength_range set forth in the body of those claims

the apparatus_claims make clear that one can practice the invention without using wavelengths in the 200_to_650 nm_range described by the ¡¬764_specification as having` strong_oxyhemoglobin_absorption' and` relatively weak_water_absorption' as long as the energy applied is sufficient to` cause vaporization of a substantially greater_volume of tissue than a volume of residual_coagulated_tissue'
that point is underscored by the fact that the apparatus_claims reciting the 200_to_650 nm_range also require a lower minimum irradiance which indicates that the purpose of the claims is to maximize volumetric_power_density through different combinations of variables ; the ¡¬ 764 patent thus contemplates that with an increase in the lasers wavelength more power will be necessary to vaporize the tissue and minimize coagulation

likewise the bodies of the asserted_method_claims contain all the steps necessary to practice the invention
independent_claims 16 31 36 40 and 42 require the delivery of radiation` causing' or` sufficient to cause' vaporization` of a substantially greater_volume of tissue than a volume of residual_coagulated_tissue'
independent claim 1 does not explicitly require vaporization but it requires that the laser_radiation be` absorbed substantially completely by the tissue within 1 mm of the surface'
thus in each of the asserted_method_claims as in the apparatus_claims the invention is recited in functional_terms ; as long as the stated objective is achieved through the various recited combinations of wavelength irradiance output_power spot_size irrigant_type and distance between the optical_fiber and the tissue it is irrelevant whether a particular_wavelength is used that would satisfy an independent requirement of being` photoselective'
while as a practical matter use of a wavelength of laser_radiation that is selectively absorbed by tissue to at least some degree will likely be necessary to satisfy the functional requirements the claim_language does not require any particular_wavelength_range or upper limit

as in the case of the apparatus_claims other claims among the method_claims provide strong support for the plaintiffs argument that the asserted_method_claims are not limited to wavelengths having a prescribed degree of differential_absorption in tissue and water
method claims 1 16 and 31 each have dependent_claims that recite the use of wavelengths` from about 200 nm to about 650 nm'
under the doctrine of claim differentiation those dependent_claims give rise to a presumption that the broader independent_claims are not confined to that range
phillips v. awh corp. 415_f.3d_1303 1315 fed.cir.2005 en banc
thus in every asserted claim of the ¡¬764_patent the language in the body of the claims recites a complete_invention for achieving the stated purpose of applying laser_radiation in a high_volumetric_power_density
removal of the duplicative preamble_language would neither alter the scope of the claims nor introduce ambiguity as to their coverage

the specification of the ¡¬764_patent further confirms that` photoselective_vaporization' is a label for the overall_invention and not a limitation on the claims
although the phrase` photoselective_vaporization' appears in the title in the abstract and six times in the rest of the written description it is consistently used in reference to the entire inventions emphasis on improved vaporization_efficiency through high_power_densities
the broad recitation in the` field of invention' which states that` [ t ] he present_invention relates generally to laser treatment of soft_tissue *1361 and more particularly to photoselective_vaporization of the prostate_pvp and to photoselective_vaporization of other_tissue' supports the plaintiffs position that the phrase is meant to serve as a label for the invention as a whole
the other references to the term including those in the abstract and in a key passage cited by the district_court also indicate that the phrase` photoselective_vaporization' describes the overall_invention

the district_court based its claim_construction largely on the following sentence in the specification ¡¬764_patent col. 3 line 66 through col. 4 line 6 photoselective_vaporization of tissue such as the prostate for treatment of bph is based upon applying a high_intensity_radiation to prostate_tissue using a radiation that is highly absorptive in the tissue while being absorbed only to a negligible_degree by water or other_irrigant during the operation at power_densities such that the majority of the energy is converted to vaporization of the tissue without significant_residual_coagulation of adjacent_tissue
as the court acknowledged 569 f.supp.2d at 322 the use of the words` based upon' rather than` means' or` is' undermines the suggestion that the term` photoselective_vaporization' is used as a definition or limitation of the claim terms
in any event however to the extent that the sentence describes` photoselective_vaporization' it is not limited to describing radiation with wavelengths that are absorbed to a substantially greater degree by tissue than by water but also describes other key aspects of the overall_invention
those include the use of high irradiance levels to achieve high` power_densities' and efficient vaporization of tissue which the district_court deemed the` central_innovative_feature' of the invention as a whole
moreover the sentences reference to absorption` during the operation' alludes to the principle expressed elsewhere in the patent that in practice the irradiance delivered to a treatment_area can be increased and the absorption of the laser_energy in the irrigant correspondingly decreased not only by selecting an appropriate_wavelength for the laser output but also by reducing the distance between the optical_fiber and the tissue thereby minimizing the amount of liquid through which the laser_energy must pass
see ¡¬764_patent col._5,_ll._52-59
thus we conclude that the quoted sentence read in context does not use the term` photoselective_vaporization' to confine the invention to the use of particular_wavelengths but is better understood as a description of the overall process described and claimed in the ¡¬764_patent

in support of its argument that the term` photoselective' is a limitation on the claims biolitec also points to a portion of the` detailed description' section of the specification which states` the wavelength used according to the present_invention for bph_treatment should be strongly absorbed in the prostate_tissue to help initiate and maintain tissue_vaporization..
the wavelength also must be minimally absorbed by the irrigant.. used during the procedure typically water'
¡¬764_patent col._12,_ll._16-21
that language indicates that using radiation of certain_wavelengths may increase the effectiveness of the invention but it does not suggest that the invention is limited to particular_wavelengths regardless of the values of the other variables in a particular device
although the quoted passage expresses a preference for using wavelengths of 200_to_650 nm other portions of the ¡¬764_specification discuss embodiments using radiation with wavelengths up to 1000 nm
¡¬764_patent col._4,_ll._28-29
moreover as noted the presence of claims reciting wavelengths of 200_to_650 nm gives rise to the inference that the remaining claims *1362 which do not contain that express wavelength limitation read on processes and devices using wavelengths outside that range
in addition the specification refers to wavelengths in the 200_to_1000 nm_range a range that includes biolitecs device which uses radiation of 980 nm_wavelength as the` preferabl [ e ]' wavelengths for use in practicing the invention
¡¬764_patent col._4,_ll._28-29

the dissent argues that while 200_to_1000 nm_wavelengths are described as preferred` for some embodiments' the` photoselective_vaporization_embodiment' is a` separate_embodiment' that` is consistently described as having a wavelength in the 200-650 range'
however the ¡¬764_specification does not support that interpretation
in the sole instance in which an` embodiment' is specifically described as involving` photoselective_vaporization' the subsequent description expresses no preferred wavelength range
instead it provides the following general explanation` according to this embodiment the method includes delivering laser_radiation to the treatment_area.. wherein the laser_radiation has a wavelength and irradiance in the treatment_area on the surface of the tissue sufficient [ to cause ] vaporization of a substantially greater_volume of tissue than a volume of residual_coagulated_tissue caused by the laser_radiation'
¡¬764_patent col._5,_ll._22-29
here as in the patents claims employing nearly identical language` photoselective_vaporization' the descriptor for the invention as a whole is expressed in functional_terms ; i.e. as long as the selected wavelength and irradiance together result in` vaporization of a substantially greater_volume of tissue than a volume of residual_coagulated_tissue' no particular_wavelength_range is required
the specification does not delineate a particular_wavelength_range until later when it addresses a more specific embodiment` in other_embodiments the delivered laser_radiation has a wavelength in a range of about 200 nm to about 650 nm'
id. col._5,_ll._41-42
the passages cited by the dissent most of which refer to the invention as a whole do not support the existence of a separate` photoselective_vaporization_embodiment' ; they merely suggest but do not require the use of certain_wavelengths as a means of increasing the inventions overall effectiveness in conjunction with other variables.1 accordingly the specification as a whole indicates that while wavelength is one of the variables employed in the invention the claims other than those specifically limited to 200_to_650 nm are not limited to particular_wavelengths exhibiting particular levels of differential_absorption in tissue and water

to be sure the specification points out the drawbacks of prior_art lasers that use longer-wavelength radiation to perform tissue ablation noting that 2100 nm radiation results in` essentially no selective_absorption by blood' and that 1064 nm radiation has` low_absorption in blood and prostate_tissue' leading to inefficient_ablation
see ¡¬764_patent col._2,_ll._15-41
however both of those examples lie above the 200_to_1000 nm_range that the ¡¬764_specification refers to as` preferabl [ e ]'
the discussion of the prior_art therefore falls far short of` mak [ ing ] clear that the invention does not include a particular feature' *1363 scimed life sys. inc. v. advanced cardiovascular sys. inc. 242_f.3d_1337 1341 fed.cir.2001 and does not rise to the level of a disclaimer of wavelengths between 650_and_1000 nm

read as a whole the ¡¬764_patent discloses methods and devices for increasing power density in the application of laser_energy which may be achieved in ways that do not require a specific_wavelength_range
other variables including e.g. irradiance spot_size distance between optical_fiber and tissue irrigant_type and output_power are incorporated in various combinations in the independent and dependent_claims which suggests that while selection of an appropriate_wavelength is one means by which the objectives set forth in the asserted_claims can be achieved no particular_wavelength_range is required by the claims

iii
for the foregoing reasons we conclude that the district_court erred when it construed the phrase` photoselective_vaporization' as a claim_limitation rather than merely a label for the invention as a whole
we therefore reverse the summary_judgment of noninfringement and remand for further_proceedings addressing whether biolitecs accused device meets the remaining claim_limitations of the ¡¬764_patent

reversed and remanded

dyk circuit_judge dissenting
i respectfully dissent from the majoritys decision that the preamble is not a claim_limitation

i
under our precedent a preamble is construed as limiting` if it recites essential_structure or steps or if it isnecessary to give life meaning and vitality to the claim' but not if` the claim_body describes a structurally complete_invention
`` 1 over the years our court has struggled to make sense of when a preamble should be construed as limiting
see bell commc'ns research inc. v. vitalink commc'ns corp. 55_f.3d_615 620 fed.cir.1995` much ink has of course been consumed in debates regarding when and to what extent claim preambles limit the scope of the claims in which they appear
``

as the majority itself appears to recognize we have not succeeded in articulating a clear and simple rule
majority_op.at 1358 ; see also patrick j. flinn claim construction trends in the federal_circuit 572 pli/pat 317 335-36 1999 characterizing the preamble limitations test as` opaque' and without a set framework
as a result of the lack of clarity as to whether a preamble should be construed as limiting our case law has become rife with inconsistency both in result and in the articulation of the test.2 as the leading treatise on patent law observes *1364` the decisions are difficult to reconcile'
3 donald s. chisum chisum on patents ¡± 8.06 [ 1 ] [ d ] 2010

it seems to me that a rule recognizing that all preambles are limiting would make better sense and would better serve the interests of all concerned
there is after all little to be said in favor of allowing an applicant in the claim drafting process to include material in the claims that is not binding
if patentees are allowed to include material in the claim definitions that is not binding patentees can suggest or imply one position before the u.s. patent & trademark office` pto' to secure allowance of the patent on the theory that the preamble is limiting and another inconsistent position in infringement litigation on the theory that it is not limiting.3 principles of fairness thus dictate that the patentee should be required to clearly define the claimed inventions scope
by creating a uniform rule that all preambles are limiting we would ensure the patentee has the burden of drafting a patent that avoids confusion as to the scope of the claims
as the supreme_court concluded in merrill v. yeomans 94_u.s._568 573-74 24_l.ed._235_(1876)` nothing can be more just and fair both to the patentee and to the public than that the former should understand and correctly describe just what he has invented and for what he claims a patent'

neither the supreme_court nor our court sitting en banc has ever addressed the preamble limitation issue
i think the time may have come for us to eliminate this vague and confusing rule

ii
even under our existing precedent which is binding on the panel i believe that the preamble_term` photoselective_vaporization' should have been construed as a claim_limitation
the determination of whether a preamble serves as a claim_limitation is` resolved only on review of the entire [ ].. patent to gain an understanding of what the inventors actually invented and intended to encompass by the claim'

u.s.a. inc. 868_f.2d_1251 1257 fed.cir.1989 ; see also applied materials inc. v. advanced semiconductor materials am. inc. 98_f.3d_1563 1572-73 fed.cir.1996` whether a preamble stating the purpose and context of the invention constitutes a limitation of the claimed process is determined on the facts of each case in light of the overall form of the claim and the invention as described in the specification and illuminated in the prosecution_history`
a preamble generally limits an invention if it recites essential_structure or steps or if it is` necessary to give life meaning and vitality' to a claim
catalina_mktg. 289 f.3d at 808 quoting pitney_bowes 182 f.3d at 1305

in my view the photoselective_vaporization language must be treated as a claim_limitation
u.s._patent_no._6986,764` the ¡¬764_patent` was a continuation-in-part of u.s._patent_no._6554,824` the ¡¬824_patent`
neither the ¡¬824 application nor the issued ¡¬824_patent used the term` photoselective_vaporization' in the claims or in the specification
the addition of the term` photoselective_vaporization' in the preamble of the claims of the ¡¬764_patent was significant
the applicant took considerable care to add new matter to the specification describing and defining photoselective *1365 vaporization
the term appears in the title of the patent once the abstract once the field of the invention_section twice the summary of the invention_section twice and the detailed_description_section once
for example the field of the invention_section states` the present_invention relates generally to laser treatment of soft_tissue and more particularly to photoselective_vaporization of the prostate_pvp and to photoselective_vaporization of other_tissue'
¡¬764_patent col. 1 ll.33-36 emphases added

the summary of the invention_section of the specification defines` photoselective_vaporization' as follows photoselective_vaporization of tissue such as the prostate for treatment of bph is based upon applying a high_intensity_radiation to prostate_tissue using a radiation that is highly absorptive in the tissue while being absorbed only to a negligible_degree by water or other_irrigant during the operation at power_densities such that the majority of the energy is converted to vaporization of the tissue without significant_residual_coagulation of adjacent_tissue
id
col.3 l.66-col.4 l.6
in light of this passage the district court properly construed` [ a ] method for photoselective_vaporization of tissue' /' [ a ] n apparatus for photoselective_vaporization of tissue' to mean` using a wavelength that is highly absorptive in the tissue while being absorbed only to a negligible_degree by water or other_irrigant'

med sys. inc. v. biolitec inc. 569_f.supp.2d_313 327 d.mass.2008
photoselective_vaporization is a product of shortening the wavelengths of the emitted signal

the majority appears to conclude that reading photoselective_vaporization as a clear limitation would be inconsistent with the specification which contemplates wavelengths up to 1000 nm
in my view the majority misconstrues the specification and prosecution_history

as the majority points out the original ¡¬824_patent was concerned among other things with reducing the wavelength of the laser_light over the prior_art
as the majority recognizes the specification repeatedly criticizes the prior_art use of` earlier_laser_systems that used longer_wavelengths of 2100 nm or 1064 nm'
majority_op.at 1357
the ¡¬824_patent reduced the claimed wavelengths to the 200_to_1000 nm_range and the specification stated that the` wavelength of the laser_light is preferably between 200_and_1000 nm'
¡¬764_patent col.4 ll.28-29 ; see ¡¬824_patent col.3 ll.44-45

the continuation-in-part application that became the ¡¬764_patent further reduced the claimed ranges
the claims of the ¡¬824_patent were amended to eliminate wavelengths in the 650-1000 range and to substitute references to wavelengths in the 200-650 range for the original wavelength range of 200-1000 nm in the claims where a specific range is included
see j.a
893-903
while the specification continued to mention wavelengths in the 200-1000 range as` preferred' for some embodiments the specification makes clear that the photoselective_vaporization_embodiment is a separate_embodiment stating that` one embodiment of the invention provides a method for photoselective_vaporization of prostate_tissue'
¡¬764_patent col.5 ll.21-22
the specification states that for that invention` it is desirable to provide a wavelength between 650_and_200 nm'
id
col. 16 ll.32-33
the photoselective_vaporization_embodiment is never described as having a wavelength in the 200-1000 range
rather it is consistently described as having wavelengths in the 200-650 range.4 the specification repeatedly touts *1366 the advantages of photoselective_vaporization that is the` 532 nm_light from these lasers is selectively absorbed by blood leading to good_hemostasis' and more efficient tissue ablation
¡¬764_patent col.2 ll.49-59

if there were any doubt that photoselective_vaporization is a claim_limitation it is resolved by the specifications statement that` [ t ] he wavelength used according to the present_invention for bph_treatment should be strongly absorbed in the prostate_tissue to help initiate and maintain tissue_vaporization..
the wavelength also must be minimally absorbed by the irrigant.. used during the procedure typically water'
¡¬764_patent col.12 ll.16-21 emphases added
while this sentence appears in the detailed_description_section of the specification we have repeatedly held that` the use of the wordsthe present_invention can be read to limit the invention to what is described as such'
martek biosciences corp. v. nutrinova inc. 579_f.3d_1363 1383 fed.cir.2009 citing honeywell int l inc. v. itt indus. inc. 452_f.3d_1312 1318 fed.cir.2006 ; see trading techs int l inc. v. espeed inc. 595_f.3d_1340_(fed.cir.2010) holding that the reference to the system of the present_invention strongly suggests that the claimed re-centering command requires a manual input ; chimie v. ppg indus. inc. 402_f.3d_1371 1379 fed.cir.2005 noting that` when the preferred embodiment is described in the specification as the invention itself the claims are not necessarily entitled to a scope broader than that embodiment' ; honeywell 452 f.3d at 1318 construing claim term to include fuel_filter because` [ o ] n at least four occasions the written description refers to the fuel_filter asthis invention orthe present_invention`
minimal absorption by the irrigant and strong absorption by tissue or photoselective_vaporization are thus mandatory aspects of this particular invention

i recognize as the majority points out that the specification for the ¡¬ 764 patent includes references to wavelengths that are not photoselective because they are not` minimally absorbed'
¡¬764_patent col.8 ll.7-12` other laser_systems may be used.. which are adapted to provide the output_power and wavelengths described herein including wavelengths in the ranges from 200 nm to 1000 nm and from 1100 nm to 1800 nm for example`
but as i have noted this language in the specification does not relate to the photoselective_vaporization_embodiment and is explained by the fact that the ¡¬ 824 patent specification included claims that were directed to longer_wavelengths
the fact that such language was retained by the *1367 ¡¬764_patent specification is explained by a desire to include additional_claims in the ¡¬764_patent not directed to the` photoselective_vaporization' embodiment
indeed a preliminary amendment to the ¡¬764 application recited seven additional_claims claims 77-80 that did not include the term` photoselective_vaporization'
claim 77 explicitly described using lasers with a wavelength in the 200 nm to 1000 nm_range
these claims were subsequently abandoned during prosecution after being rejected as anticipated by u.s. patent nos._5776 175_and_5776,127
j.a
369

under the circumstances it seems clear to me that` photoselective_vaporization' should be construed as a claim_limitation ; by adding this terminology during prosecution of the ¡¬764_patent the patentee conceded that the term gave life meaning and vitality to the claims.5

therefore contrary to the majority i would hold that photoselective_vaporization is a claim_limitation

the dissent asserts that the language discussing use of wavelengths greater than 650 nm is a remnant of an earlier parent patent and was retained in order to support additional_claims claims 77-80 which did not recite` photoselective_vaporization' and were abandoned after being rejected as anticipated by prior_art
the references to longer_wavelengths all appeared in the initial application for the ¡¬764_patent however while claims 77-80 were not added until a later amendment
that sequence of events suggests that the longer-wavelength references were included because the original` photoselective_vaporization' claims were intended to encompass longer_wavelengths

see bicon inc. v. straumann co. 441_f.3d_945 952 fed.cir.2006` while it is true that preamble_language is often treated as nonlimiting in nature it is not unusual for this court to treat preamble_language as limiting as it is in this case
`` ; storage_tech corp. v. cisco sys. inc. 329_f.3d_823 831 fed.cir.2003` whether to treat a preamble as a claim_limitation is determined on the facts of each case in light of the claim as a whole and the invention described in the patent
`` ; catalina_mktg. 289 f.3d at 808 fed.cir.2002` no litmus test defines when a preamble limits claim scope`

[ o ] ne can not determine a preambles effect except by reference to the specific claim of which it is a component'

of course if the patentee makes his or her positions explicit the patentee could be barred by the doctrine of prosecution_history estoppel from taking such inconsistent positions
but in many cases it is not readily apparent whether the patentee has taken inconsistent positions

see e.g. ¡¬764_patent col.12 ll.16-34` the wavelength used according to the present_invention for bph_treatment should be strongly absorbed in the prostate_tissue to help initiate and maintain tissue_vaporization without creating deep tissue heating
the wavelength also must be minimally absorbed by the irrigant it used during the procedure typically water
the 532 nm_light produced by the system of fig.5 is both strongly absorbed in oxyhemoglobin and weakly absorbed in water..
in yet other_embodiments wavelengths in the range from 200 nm-500 nm are used which have strong_oxyhemoglobin_absorption and relatively weak_water_absorption..' ; id
col.14 ll.57-59` ktp laser_energy will be generated by a high power 532 nm laser capable of delivering 80w of ktp laser power to tissue
`` ; id
col.15 ll.25-55 comparing the 1064 nm_wavelength used in the prior_art to the 532 nm_wavelength and concluding that the 532 laser beam is preferable because it is` substantially completely absorbed within less than about 1 mm of the surface of prostatic_tissue..
the coagulation zone is very thin because of the small optical penetration depth of the 532 wavelength.. other wavelengths which are substantially completely absorbed within less than about 1 mm of the surface of the prostatic_tissue include wavelengths less than about 650 nm for example between about 200 nm and 650 nm`
5
as the majority points out the reference to the 200_to_650 nm_range in the dependent_claims claims 4-6 19-21 32-34 37 59-big_token__62_and_67__big_token -74 suggests that the independent_claims are broader
see majority_op.at 1359-60
but this merely suggests that the photoselective_vaporization limitation applies to somewhat longer_wavelengths than 200_to_650 nm
