i
background
the ¡¬122_patent claims the compound_risedronate the active_ingredient of p & gs osteoporosis drug actonelthe_r
in august 2004 p & g sued teva for infringement of the ¡¬122_patent after teva notified p & g that it planned to market risedronate as a generic equivalent of actonelthe_r
specifically p & g alleged that tevas proposed drug infringed claim 4 of the ¡¬122_patent for the compound_risedronate claim 16 for pharmaceutical compositions containing risedronate and claim 23 for methods of treating diseases using risedronate
in its defense teva argued that the ¡¬ *993 122 patent was invalid as obvious in light of p & gs expired u.s._patent 4,761,406 the` ¡¬406_patent` filed on june_6,_1985 and issued on august 2 1988
alternately teva argues that the ¡¬122_patent is invalid for obviousness-type_double_patenting

risedronate the subject of the contested claims is a member of a group of compounds referred to as bisphosphonates
bisphosphonates in general are active in inhibiting bone_resorption
the first two promising bisphosphonates studied for the treatment of metabolic bone diseases etidronate ehdp and clodronate had clinical problems which prevented their commercialization
p & g conducted a significant amount of experimentation involving hundreds of different bisphosphonate compounds but could not predict the efficacy or toxicity of the new_compounds
eventually researchers at p & g identified risedronate as a promising drug candidate

on december 6 1985 risedronates inventors applied for a patent on the compound
p & g is the owner by assignment of the ¡¬122_patent entitled` pharmaceutical compositions containing geminal diphosphonates' which issued on december 10 1996

risedronate is neither claimed nor disclosed in the ¡¬406_patent
instead the ¡¬406_patent entitled` regimen for treating osteoporosis' claims an intermittent_dosing_method for treating osteoporosis
as the trial_court noted the ¡¬406_patent` addresses the central problem seen in bisphosphonates at the time namely that they inhibited bone mineralization by teaching the use of a cyclic administrative regimen to achieve a separation of the benign effect of anti-resorption from the unwanted side effect of anti-mineralization in patients'
procter & gamble 536 f.supp.2d at 492
the ¡¬ 406 patent lists thirty-six polyphosphonate molecules as treatment candidates and eight preferred compounds for intermittent dosing including 2-pyr ehdp
teva contends that the structural_similarities between risedronate and 2-pyr ehdp render the challenged claims of the ¡¬122_patent obvious

from the testimony at trial the district_court concluded that the ¡¬ 406 patent would not have led a person of ordinary_skill in the art to identify 2-pyr ehdp as the lead_compound
in light of the extremely unpredictable nature of bisphosphonates at the time of the invention the district_court also found that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would not have been motivated to make the specific_molecular_modifications to make risedronate
the district_court concluded that unexpected_results of risedronates potency and toxicity rebut a claim of obviousness
the district_court found that secondary_considerations of non-obviousness supported its conclusions
similarly the court found that the ¡¬122_patent was not invalid for obviousness-type_double_patenting
this consolidated appeal followed
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

discussion
i
standard of review
`` on appeal from a bench_trial this court reviews the district_courts conclusions of law de novo and findings of fact for clear_error'
golden blount inc. v. robert h. peterson co. 365_f.3d_1054 1058 fed.cir.2004
whether the subject_matter of a patent is obvious is a question of law and is reviewed de novo
pharmastem_therapeutics inc. v. viacell inc. 491_f.3d_1342 1359 fed.cir.2007
factual determinations underlying the obviousness issue are reviewed for clear_error
alza corp. v. mylan labs. inc. 464_f.3d_1286 1289 fed.cir.2006
the evidentiary burden to show facts supporting a *994 conclusion of invalidity is one of clear and convincing_evidence
ak steel corp. v. sollac & ugine 344_f.3d_1234 1238-39 fed.cir.2003
non-statutory double_patenting is a legal question reviewed without deference
georgia-pacific corp. v. u.s. gypsum co. 195_f.3d_1322 1326 fed.cir.1999

ii
patent obviousness-legal standard
under the u.s._patent act an invention can not be patented if` the subject_matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary_skill in the art to which said subject_matter pertains'
35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a
patents are presumed to be valid
kao corp. v. unilever u.s. inc. 441_f.3d_963 968 fed.cir.2006
a party seeking to invalidate a patent based on obviousness must demonstrate` by clear and convincing_evidence that a skilled_artisan would have been motivated to combine the teachings of the prior_art references to achieve the claimed invention and that the skilled_artisan would have had a reasonable_expectation of success in doing so'
pfizer inc. v. apotex inc. 480_f.3d_1348 1361 fed.cir.2007
clear and convincing_evidence places in the fact finder` an abiding conviction that the truth of [ the ] factual contentions are highly probable'
colorado v. new mexico 467_u.s._310 316 104_s.ct._2433 81_l.ed.2d_247_(1984) quotation_marks omitted

the obviousness determination turns on underlying factual inquiries involving 1 the scope and content of prior_art 2 differences between claims and prior_art 3 the level of ordinary_skill in pertinent art and 4 secondary_considerations such as commercial_success and satisfaction of a long-felt need
graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 17 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966)
the supreme_court has explained that the federal_circuits` teaching suggestion or motivation' test provides helpful insight into the obviousness question as long as it is not applied rigidly
ksr int l co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 127_s.ct._1727 1741 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007)
accordingly under ksr` it remains necessary to identify some reason that would have led a chemist to modify a known compound in a particular_manner to establish prima_facie obviousness of a new claimed compound'
takeda chem indus. ltd. v. alphapharm pty. ltd. 492_f.3d_1350 1357 fed.cir.2007

if a patent challenger makes a prima_facie showing of obviousness the owner may rebut based on` unexpected_results' by demonstrating` that the claimed invention exhibits some superior property or advantage that a person of ordinary_skill in the relevant art would have found surprising or unexpected'
in re soni 54_f.3d_746 750 fed.cir.1995
we consider the relevant factors in turn

iii
identification of a lead compound
an obviousness argument based on structural_similarity between claimed and prior_art_compounds` clearly depends on a preliminary finding that one of ordinary_skill in the art would have selected [ the prior_art_compound ] as a lead_compound'
takeda 492 f.3d at 1359 ; see also eisai_co._ltd. v. dr._reddys labs. ltd. 533_f.3d_1353 1359 fed.cir.2008 stating that` post-ksr a prima_facie_case of obviousness for a chemical compound still in general begins with the reasoned identification of a lead_compound' in the prior_art
teva argues that the ¡¬406_patent identifies 2-pyr ehdp as the most promising molecule for the inhibition of bone_resorption
the trial_court disagreed and concluded from the evidence that a *995 person of ordinary_skill in the art would not have identified 2-pyr ehdp as a lead_compound for the treatment of osteoporosis

we need not reach this question because we conclude that even if 2-pyr ehdp was a lead_compound the evidence does not establish that it would have been obvious to a person of ordinary_skill at the time of the invention to modify 2-pyr ehdp to create risedronate

iv
obviousness of risedronate in light of the prior_art
to decide whether risedronate was obvious in light of the prior_art a court must determine whether at the time of invention a person having ordinary_skill in the art would have had` reason to attempt to make the composition' known as risedronate and` a reasonable_expectation of success in doing so'
pharmastem_therapeutics inc. v. viacell inc. 491_f.3d_1342 1360 fed.cir.2007

the district_court concluded that even if 2-pyr ehdp were a lead_compound it would not render the ¡¬122_patents claims on risedronate obvious because a person having ordinary_skill in the art would not have had reason to make risedronate based on the prior_art
the district_courts findings also support the conclusion that there could have been no reasonable_expectation as to risedronates success

the question of obviousness` often turns on the structural_similarities and differences between the claimed compound and the prior_art_compound [ ]'
eisai_co._ltd. v. dr._reddys labs. ltd. 533_f.3d_1353 1356-57 fed.cir.2008 ; see also sanofi-synthelabo v. apotex inc. 550_f.3d_1075 1086 fed.cir.2008` precedent establishes the analytical procedure whereby a close_structural_similarity between a new chemical compound and prior_art_compounds is generally deemed to create a prima_facie_case of obviousness..' ; in re mayne 104_f.3d_1339 1343 fed.cir.1997` structural relationships often provide the requisite_motivation to modify known compounds to obtain new_compounds
`` ; in re payne 606_f.2d_303 313-15 ccpa 1979 discussing the presumption of obviousness based on close_structural_similarity
in this case risedronate and 2-pyr ehdp are positional isomers ; they each contain the same atoms arranged in different ways
in risedronate the hydroxy-ethanediphosphonate group is connected to the # 3 carbon of a pyridine ring while in 2-pyr ehdp the hydroxy-ethane-diphosphonate group is connected to the # 2 carbon
because the nitrogen atom is in a different position in the two molecules they differ in three dimensional shape charge distribution and hydrogen bonding properties

to successfully argue that a new compound is obvious the challenger may show` that the prior_art would have suggested making the specific_molecular_modifications necessary to achieve the claimed invention'
takeda 492 f.3d at 1356 quotation_marks omitted
`` in keeping with the flexible nature of the obviousness inquiry the requisite_motivation [ to modify ] can come from any number of sources'
eisai 533 f.3d at 1357 citation omitted
thus in addition to structural_similarity between the compounds a prima_facie_case of obviousness may be shown by` adequate support in the prior_art' for the change in structure
in re grabiak 769_f.2d_729 731-32 fed.cir.1985
as we noted in takeda a known compound may suggest its homolog analog or isomer because such compounds often have similar properties and therefore chemists of ordinary_skill would ordinarily contemplate making them to try to obtain compounds with *996 improved properties.. [ however ] it remains necessary to identify some reason that would have led a chemist to modify a known compound in a particular_manner to establish prima_facie obviousness of a new claimed compound
492 f.3d at 1356-57 citation omitted

at trial p & gs expert witnesses testified that in 1985 a person having ordinary_skill in the art realized that the properties of bisphosphonates could not be anticipated based on their structure
additionally the trial_court relied on contemporaneous writings from herbert_fleisch the preeminent authority on bisphosphonates during the relevant time period
dr. fleisch wrote in 1984 that` every compound while remaining a bisphosphonate exhibits its own physical-chemical biological and therapeutic characteristics so that each bisphosphonate has to be considered on its own
to infer from one compound the effects in another is dangerous and can be misleading'
herbert_fleisch chemistry and mechanisms of action of bisphosphonates in bone resorption metastasis and diphosphonates 33-40 s. garattini ed. 1985
in this case p & g synthesized and tested 2-pyr ehdp risedronate 3-pyr ehdp and 4-pyr ehdp another structural isomer
confirming the unpredictability of bisphosphonates test results for 4-pyr ehdp revealed that it was not active in inhibiting bone_resorption despite its close relationship with potent compounds
in light of the supreme_courts instruction in ksr the federal_circuit has stated that` [ t ] o the extent an art is unpredictable as the chemical arts often are ksrs focus on [ ]identified predictable_solutions may present a difficult hurdle because potential solutions are less likely to be genuinely predictable'
eisai 533_f.3d_1353 1359 quoting ksr 127 s.ct.at 1742
the district_court found that teva failed to clear that hurdle establishing insufficient motivation for a person of ordinary_skill to synthesize and test risedronate
this finding was not clearly erroneous

additionally there was an insufficient showing that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have had a` reasonable_expectation of success' in synthesizing and testing risedronate
pharmastem 491 f.3d at 1360
in ksr the supreme_court stated that when an obvious modification` leads to the anticipated success' the invention is likely the product of ordinary_skill and is obvious under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103
127 s.ct.at 1742
`` [ o ] bviousness can not be avoided simply by a showing of some degree of unpredictability in the art so long as there was a reasonable probability of success'
pfizer 480 f.3d at 1364 citing in re corkill 771_f.2d_1496 1500 fed.cir.1985
here the district_courts findings indicate that there was no reasonable_expectation in 1985 that risedronate would be a successful compound

cases following ksr have considered whether a given molecular modification would have been carried out as part of routine testing
see e.g. takeda 492 f.3d at 1360 discussing the district_courts finding that a modification was not known to be beneficial and was not considered` routine'
when a person of ordinary_skill is faced with` a finite number of identified predictable_solutions' to a problem and pursues` the known options within his or her technical grasp' the resulting discovery` is likely the product not of innovation but of ordinary_skill and common sense'
ksr 127 s.ct.at 1742
so too` [ g ] ranting patent protection to advances that would occur in the ordinary course without real innovation retards progress'
id.at 1741
in other cases though researchers can only` vary all parameters or try each of numerous possible choices until *997 one possibly arrive [ s ] at a successful result where the prior_art [ gives ] either no indication of which parameters [ are ] critical or no direction as to which of many possible choices is likely to be successful'
in re_o'farrell 853_f.2d_894 903 fed.cir.1988
in such cases` courts should not succumb to hindsight claims of obviousness'
in re kubin 561_f.3d_1351_(fed.cir.2009)
similarly patents are not barred just because it was obvious` to explore a new technology or general approach that seemed to be a promising field of experimentation where the prior_art gave only general guidance as to the particular form of the claimed invention or how to achieve it'
in re_o'farrell 853 f.2d at 903

in this case there is no credible evidence that the structural_modification was routine
the district_court found that the appellees expert was evasive on this topic stating that the witness` did not directly respond to most questions posed to him about whether it would be common for a chemist who develops a pyridine compound to conceive of and make [ 2-pyr ehdp 3-pyr ehdp and 4-pyr ehdp ] isomers'
procter & gamble 536 f.supp.2d at 486
but evidence of evasion is not necessarily evidence that the testimony would otherwise have been favorable
the only direct evidence that the structural_modification was routine was presented by an expert witness that the district_court judge discredited.1

accordingly we conclude that the district_court did not clearly err in finding that teva had not established a prima_facie_case of obviousness as to the challenged claims of the ¡¬122_patent

v. unexpected results
the district_court found that even if teva could establish a prima_facie_case of obviousness p & g had introduced sufficient_evidence of unexpected_results to rebut such a showing
such evidence included` test data showing that the claimed composition [ ] possess [ es ] unexpectedly improved properties or properties that the prior_art does not have'
in re dillon 919_f.2d_688 692-93 fed.cir.1990
because teva did not establish a prima_facie_case of obviousness p & g need not rely on this evidence to defend the ¡¬122_patent

nonetheless we note that p & gs witnesses consistently testified that the properties of risedronate were not expected
for example dr._benedict testified that he and other researchers did not predict the potency of risedronate
ms. mcosker testified that she was` very surprised' by the low dose at which risedronate was effective
dr. miller stated that the superior properties of risedronate were unexpected and could not have been predicted
in a test to determine the lowest dose at which these compounds caused toxic reactions risedronate outperformed 2-pyr ehdp by a substantial margin
risedronate showed no observable toxic effect at a dose of 0.75 mg_p/kg/day while 2-pyr ehdps` no observable effect level' was only 0.25 mg_p/kg/day
in another test involving live animals 2-pyr ehdp was lethal at a dose of 1.0 mg_p/kg/day while risedronate was *998 not
ultimately the district_court weighed the evidence and evaluated the credibility of the witnesses in concluding that p & g had introduced sufficient_evidence of unexpected_results to rebut any finding of obviousness

vi
secondary considerations of non-obviousness
secondary considerations of non-obviousness include the commercial_success of the invention at issue and its satisfaction of a long-felt need
b.f. goodrich co. v. aircraft braking sys corp. 72_f.3d_1577 1582 fed.cir.1996
the district_court found that secondary_considerations supported a finding of non-obviousness
when present such factors` may often be the most probative and cogent evidence [ of non-obviousness ] in the record'
stratoflex inc. v. aeroquip corp. 713_f.2d_1530 1538 fed.cir.1983

the district_court found that risedronate marketed as actonel has been an undisputed commercial_success and satisfied a long-felt unmet_need.2 this conclusion was based on the testimony of dr. daniel c. smith who stated that risedronate experienced favorable growth and had amassed $ 2.7 billion in aggregate domestic sales
the district_court based its finding of a long-felt unmet_need on the fact that in the mid-1980s osteoporosis was recognized as a serious disease and existing treatments were inadequate
however because the competing drug alendronate was available before risedronate teva contends that risedronate could not have satisfied any unmet_need
teva argues that the long-felt need must be unmet at the time the invention becomes available on the market when it can actually satisfy that need
to support this argument teva cites monarch knitting mach corp. v. sulzer morat gmbh 139_f.3d_877_(fed.cir.1998)
in fact monarch rejects a similar argument partly because the competing inventions were not actually produced until after the claimed inventions filing_date
id.at 884
here alendronate was not produced until ten years after the filing of the ¡¬122_patent
under monarch we look to the filing_date of the challenged invention to assess the presence of a long-felt and unmet_need
accordingly it was not clear_error for the district_court to conclude that risedronate met such a need and that secondary_considerations supported a finding of non-obviousness

vii
whether the ¡¬406_patent is prior_art
as an alternative to its position that risedronate was not obvious p & g argues that the ¡¬406_patent should not be considered prior_art with respect to the ¡¬122_patent because risedronate was first synthesized by p & g before the ¡¬406_patent was filed
at trial dr._benedict one of the inventors named in the ¡¬122_patent testified that he synthesized risedronate in may 1985
p & g submitted a portion of dr._benedicts laboratory notebook which contains a may_3,_1985 entry detailing the structure of risedronate and the procedure for its synthesis but this entry was unwitnessed and was not corroborated by any other evidence

*999` it is well established that when a party seeks to prove conception via the oral testimony of a putative inventor the party must proffer evidence corroborating that testimony'
shu-hui chen v. bouchard 347_f.3d_1299 1309 fed.cir.2003
the inventor` must provide independent corroborating evidence in addition to his own statements and documents'
hahn v. wong 892_f.2d_1028 1032 fed.cir.1989
because p & g did not provide adequate corroborating evidence of an earlier invention date for risedronate the district_court correctly concluded that the ¡¬406_patent qualifies as prior_art for purposes of this inquiry

viii
obviousness-type double patenting
in addition to its obviousness defense teva also asserted that the ¡¬122_patent was invalid for double_patenting
the double_patenting doctrine is designed to prevent a patent_owner from extending his exclusive rights to an invention through claims in a later-filed patent that are not patentably distinct from claims in the earlier filed patent
geneva pharm. inc. v. glaxosmithkline plc 349_f.3d_1373 1378 fed.cir.2003 in general the obviousness analysis applies to double_patenting except for three distinctions
first statutory obviousness compares claimed subject_matter to the prior_art while non-statutory double_patenting compares claims in an earlier patent to claims in a later patent or application
id.at 1377_n._1
second double_patenting does not require inquiry into a motivation to modify the prior_art
id
finally double_patenting does not require inquiry into objective criteria suggesting non-obviousness
id

having concluded that risedronate was not obvious under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 we similarly conclude that the ¡¬122_patent is not invalid for obviousness-type_double_patenting
additionally we agree with the district_court that the claims of the ¡¬122_patent are distinct from the claims of the ¡¬406_patent
comparing the claims of the ¡¬122_patent to those of the ¡¬406_patent we note that while claims 4_and_16 of the ¡¬122_patent explicitly claim the risedronate compound the ¡¬406_patent claims an intermittent dosing regimen for the treatment of osteoporosis and claims no new_compounds
accordingly teva failed to present clear and convincing_evidence of overlap between the claims of the two patents to invalidate the ¡¬122_patent based on obviousness-type_double_patenting
