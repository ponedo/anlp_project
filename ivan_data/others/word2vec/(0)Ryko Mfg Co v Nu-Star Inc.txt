ryko manufacturing co. ryko sued nu-star inc. nu-star for infringing its reissue patent re
32,601 ¡¬601
the united_states_district_court for the district of minnesota granted nu-stars motion for summary_judgment based on invalidity determining that the patented_invention would have been obvious in light of the prior_art
ryko_appeals and we affirm

facts
conventional automatic car washes were activated by mechanical_insertion_devices
these devices activated the carwash system by permitting electrical_current to flow through the system when an appropriate article such as a coin token credit_card or receipt was inserted into the device
the device required much maintenance because the mechanical hardware could cause problems or the device could become congested with too many inserted articles

many attempts were made to solve these problems and a solution was discovered when klein invented the device disclosed in reissue patent ¡¬601 which was assigned to ryko
the ¡¬601_patent discloses a combination comprising an automatic_car_wash_system electronically activated by an electrical numerical keypad device

nu-star also sells an automatic_car_wash_system which utilizes an electronic_keypad_activation_device
ryko sued nu-star for infringing claim seven of its patent
nu-star countered with its motion for summary_judgment

after considering all the primary_considerations enumerated in graham v. john deere,1 the district_court found that utilization of the numerical keypad device to electronically activate an automatic_car_wash_system was a combination invention that was clearly suggested by the prior_art
therefore the district_court determined that at the time the invention was made it would have been obvious to a person of ordinary_skill in the art
the district_court found that the secondary_considerations purportedly weighed in favor of nonobviousness but were not sufficiently influential to override the finding of obviousness compelled by the primary_considerations

accordingly the district_court granted nu-stars motion for summary_judgment
ryko_appeals to this court asserting various errors in the district_courts rationale

standard of review
a patent is presumed valid.2 to overturn a patent the challenger must clearly prove those facts which support *716 patent_invalidity.3 here the appellee asserts that the patent is invalid because the invention of claim seven would have been obvious
`` while the ultimate question of patent validity is one of law' the conclusion that an invention would not have been obvious is dependent upon several basic factual inquiries.4 therefore a district_court can properly grant as a matter of law a motion for summary_judgment on patent_invalidity when the factual inquiries into obviousness present no genuine_issue of material_facts.5

the nonobviousness condition
a patent is invalid
if the differences between the subject_matter sought to be patented and the prior_art are such that the subject_matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary_skill in the art to which said subject_matter pertains.6

in determining whether an invention would have been obvious at the time it was made section 103 requires a court 1 to determine the scope and content of the prior_art ; 2 to ascertain the differences between the prior_art and the claims at issue ; and 3 to resolve the level of ordinary_skill in the pertinent_art.7` such secondary_considerations as commercial_success long felt but unsolved_needs [ and ] failure of others' [ to invent ] are also relevant to the obviousness_inquiry.8 since the facts to support a conclusion of invalidity of an issued patent must be proved by clear and convincing evidence this standard must be applied by the court in deciding whether requirements have been met for summary determination of obviousness.9

primary considerations
1
scope and content of the pertinent_prior_art
a
scope of the pertinent_prior_art
the district_court accepted the concession by both parties that the pertinent_art encompassed automatic_car_washing_systems
however we feel that such a definition of the pertinent_art is too broad
the art of automatic_car_washing_systems involves technologies ranging from hydraulics and fluid mechanics to electronic microcircuitry
questioning whether the invention would have been obvious to one having ordinary_skill in the art of automatic_car_washing_systems is too imprecise to illuminate the obviousness_inquiry

the relevant_art` is defined by the nature of the problem confronting the would-be inventor
`` 10 here the problem entailed permitting only selected people to activate an automatic_car_wash_system with a device not subject to mechanical problems
accordingly the inventor sought to discover the most convenient and efficient activation device for the purpose
thus the relevant_art did not encompass automatic_car_washing_systems but rather activation devices for such systems

b
content of the pertinent_prior_art
the district_court evidently accepted and ryko did not dispute nu-stars description of the prior_art
the evidence of prior_art indicated that automatic car wash equipment was common ; automatic_activation by a token credit_card receipt or coins was common ; automatic_activation had been connected to a garage door opening mechanism ; keypad_code_devices were common as electronic signal input devices keypad_code_devices opened garage_doors ; keypad *717 code devices limited access to many products ; enter keys were implemented in keypad entry devices ; and computers and digital circuitry were well-known and used for a variety of applications in the car_wash_industry

the prior_art references that are particularly pertinent to the patented activation device in question are the keypad_code_devices that opened garage_doors and the automatic_car_wash_systems which were activated by a mechanical_insertion_device i.e
coins credit_card etc
with the undisputed pertinent_prior_art in perspective there exists no genuine_issue of material_fact as to the scope and content of the pertinent_prior_art

2
difference between the prior_art and the claims at issue
a
the claim at issue
the only ¡¬601_patent claim at issue is claim seven
claim seven comprises a car washing system which is activated by a keypad entry system
to activate the car wash the operator punches his numerical_code into the numerical keypad
after entering the code the operator presses a designated button which electronically transmits the inputted numerical_code for comparison with a predetermined numerical_code
if the inputted numerical_code matches the predetermined numerical_code the circuit is closed between the electrical power source and the car wash system thereby activating the latter

b
differences between prior_art and claim seven
the district_court determined that the difference between the prior_art and the claim at issue was essentially the substitution of a keypad code device for a coin box or other common input device
appellant insists that focusing on only one element of the claimed invention instead of the claim as a whole is legal_error according to w.l
gore & associates v. garlock inc.11 we believe that appellant interprets gore too expansively

gore simply requires the court to evaluate the claim as a whole and not to unduly focus on one facet of the claimed invention.12 however graham instructs the court to ascertain the principal differences between the patented claim and the prior_art.13 in evaluating claim seven as a whole the district_court found only one difference disclosed by claim seven that was not taught by the prior_art the supplantation of other carwash system_activation_devices with an electronic_keypad_activation_device
when analyzing a patent claim for obviousness the claim should be considered as a whole but the differences between the claim and the prior_art need to be identified to place the obviousness analysis into proper perspective

appellant also argues that the district_court erred by denigrating claim seven as being a combination of old elements lacking synergism
we do agree that the absence of synergism is irrelevant to the issue of obviousness.14 synergism is probative only of nonobviousness ; the obverse is not true.15 however we do not believe the district_courts misunderstanding of this particular point of law sufficiently tainted its ultimate decision on obviousness to constitute reversible error

we note also that the district_court has implied that` combination inventions' are to be treated differently from other inventions
the federal_circuit has dispelled this notion
the language of this court in stratoflex inc. v. aeroquip corp.16 is instructive on this point

there is no warrant for judicial classification of patents whether into` combination' patents and some other unnamed *718 and undefined class or otherwise
nor is there warrant for differing treatment or consideration of patents based on a judicially devised label
reference to` combination' patents is moreover meaningless
virtually all patents are` combination patents' if by that label one intends to describe patents having claims to inventions formed of a combination of elements
it is difficult to visualize at least in the mechanical-structural arts a` non-combination' invention i.e. an invention consisting of a single element
such inventions if they exist are rare indeed.17
for a` combination' or any other invention to have been obvious the prior_art must suggest the desirability of making the claimed invention.18 we conclude that the district_court correctly determined the scope of the pertinent_prior_art and compared it to the claimed invention to ascertain the salient differences

because the first and second graham considerations present no genuine_issues of material_fact the district_court was in a position at that point to determine whether prior_art would have suggested the claimed combination
the penultimate question then was what person in terms of skill levels would reasonably have perceived the suggestion

3
level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art
appellant asserts legal_error in the failure of the district_court to resolve the level of ordinary_skill in the art
the importance of resolving the level of ordinary_skill in the art lies in the necessity of maintaining objectivity in the obviousness_inquiry
instead of ascertaining what was subjectively obvious to the inventor at the time of invention the court must ascertain what would have been objectively obvious to one of ordinary_skill in the art at such time.19 hence the level of ordinary_skill in the art is a factual question that must be resolved and considered

the district_court did consider the level of ordinary_skill in the art but did not articulate its resolution of the issue
probative of the required level of skill in the art are factors such as educational_level of the inventor educational_level of those who work in the industry which manufactures powered_system_activation_devices and the sophistication of technology involved all of which was before the trial court.20 appellees evidence shows that most of the personnel developing the new activation device for ryko had attained an engineering degree at the minimum
however appellants expert vaguely described the level of ordinary_skill in the art as being` low to medium'

when a motion for summary_judgment is before the court` the evidence of the nonmovant is to be believed and all justifiable_inferences are to be drawn in his favor
`` 21 for the sake of review we assume that the district_court believed the non-movant appellants evidence that the ordinary_skill in the art was low to medium
however appellants evidence does not explain to what the low to medium level of skill in the art is related

appellees uncontested evidence indicated that two of the three inventors of the patented_device have engineering degrees
one designer of an accused infringing product has a masters degree in electrical engineering and another has worked in the electronics industry for 28 years
moreover the prior_art teaches that powered_system_activation_devices utilize sophisticated electronic devices
based on the undisputed evidence before it and all justifiable *719 inferences flowing therefrom the court must have resolved the level of ordinary_skill in the art as being that of an engineer with low to medium capability in the technology of powered_system_activation_devices
this resolution of the level of ordinary_skill in the pertinent_art presenting no genuine_issues of material_fact is sufficient to shed light on the obviousness_inquiry

secondary considerations
the considerations such as commercial_success long felt but unsolved_needs and the failure of others to invent are relevant to the obviousness_inquiry.22 because the case before us is a review of the grant of summary_judgment we accept appellants evidence on secondary_considerations as true.23 rykos chief executive officer stated in an affidavit that the car_wash_industry had not solved its long standing problems with automatic_activators until the patented_invention was introduced
moreover appellant also presented affidavits which showed that the efforts of others to solve the problems with automatic_activators had failed
furthermore a few companies which copied the patented electrical keypad car wash activation system enjoyed commercial_success

appellee argues that appellant failed to produce evidence of a nexus between the merits of the invention and its commercial_success
such a nexus is required to prove that the commercial_success is not ascribable to other irrelevant commercial and economic factors.24 however prima facie evidence of nexus is established if there was commercial_success and if the invention disclosed in the patent was that which was commercially successful.25 sufficient prima facie evidence was before the court to withstand summary_judgment on the nexus issue
hence we assume that a nexus existed between the commercial_success and the merits of the invention

resolving all evidence and justifiable_inferences in favor of appellant the district_court found that the secondary_considerations weighed in favor of appellant
however the district_court determined that secondary_considerations did not carry sufficient weight to override a determination of obviousness based on primary_considerations
we conclude that such a determination can be made as long as the secondary_considerations are contemplated by the court.26 our decision is not meant to weaken our previous statements that secondary_considerations are not secondary in importance to primary_considerations ; we simply hold that a court is entitled to weigh all the considerations primary and secondary and then render its decision

conclusion
this case presents no genuine_issues regarding any material_fact

the district_court found that the prior_art taught one to use an electrical keypad device to send a signal which if proper would activate a powered system by closing a switch to enable electrical_current to flow to the system e.g
an electronic garage door opener
the prior_art also taught that automatic_car_wash_systems could be activated by mechanical_insertion_devices
the principal difference between the prior_art and the claimed invention is the use of an electronic keypad device instead of a mechanical_insertion_device for the specific purpose of selectively activating an automatic_car_wash_system
we agree with the district_court that the desirability *720 of the claimed combination was suggested by the prior_art

moreover the undisputed_facts of record reflect that the level of ordinary_skill in the art is typified by an engineer of low to medium_skill in the technology of powered_system_activation_devices
appellant cites no evidence to refute that designing and assembling the claimed combination would have been obvious to an engineer adequately versed in the technology of powered_system_activation_devices

accordingly we conclude that the district_court decision that the claimed invention would have been obvious is supported by the undisputed_facts and that appellee was entitled to judgment as a matter of law
the district_court correctly granted summary_judgment to appellees based on patent_invalidity because the invention at the time it was made would have been obvious to one of ordinary_skill in the art
