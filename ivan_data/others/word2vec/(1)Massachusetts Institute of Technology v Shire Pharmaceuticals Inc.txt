stoll circuit_judge
massachusetts_institute of technology and childrens medical_center_corporation collectively` mit' brought suit against shire pharmaceuticals inc. and shire_regenerative_medicine inc. collectively` shire' for infringement of u.s. patent nos._5770 193_and_5759,830
the ¡¬ 193 and ¡¬830_patent s are directed to three-dimensional_scaffolding for growing cells in vitro to produce organ_tissue in vivo
following the district_courts construction of the terms` vascularized_organ_tissue' and` cells derived from a vascularized_tissue' and its determination that the term` three-dimensional_scaffold' was not indefinite the parties stipulated to a final_judgment of validity and infringement
for the reasons below we affirm

background
i
in the field of organ transplantation surgeons face the challenge of donor scarcity in addition to the technical complexity of transplanting whole or segmented organs into organ recipients
given the limited availability of implantable organs scientists have developed methods of growing artificial organ_tissue in vitro1 by seeding cells onto support structures known as scaffolds or matrices
these scaffolds are engineered to allow cells to attach and grow while enabling the diffusion of vital cell nutrients to the cells to contribute to the growth of new functional tissue

before the inventions of the asserted patents scientists created organ_tissue with scaffolds made of either` permanent' synthetic polymers or biodegradable non-synthetic materials like collagen
preferably these scaffolds eventually would be absorbed by the body leaving behind the newly formed tissue
with the former method however the` permanent' synthetic matrix could not be absorbed by the body
drawbacks of the latter collagen-based matrix included the inability to control the collagen structures configuration and the variable absorption of the collagen_matrix by the surrounding tissue

it was also generally understood that in engineering thick organs like a liver or pancreas the cells at the center of the *1114 artificial structure tended to die as the cell density increased
this was due to the decreased diffusion rate of oxygen and nutrients to the inner_cells at the center of the growing structure
these prior_art_methods of tissue engineering therefore were primarily used to make thinner organs such as artificial_skin

in the face of these challenges the inventors of the ¡¬193 and ¡¬830_patent s drs
vacanti and langer developed biodegradable synthetic matrices that provide support for cell_growth and enhance the formation of blood_vessels i.e. vascularization of the growing cell_mass after implantation
the specifications of the ¡¬193 and ¡¬830_patent s state that` [ t ] he design and construction of the scaffolding is of primary importance' and that the scaffolding must be` shaped to maximize surface area to allow adequate_diffusion of nutrients and growth_factors to the cells'
¡¬193_patent_col. 6_ll._25 -27 ; ¡¬830_patent_col. 10_ll._12 -15
while the prior_art_methods were generally used to grow only artificial_skin the scaffolding of the claimed invention can support the growth of organs with varying thicknesses
indeed the specifications describe that an object of the invention is to` provid [ e ] a variety of organs including skin liver kidneys blood_vessels nerves and muscles which functionally resemble the naturally occurring_organ'
¡¬193_patent_col. 3_ll._9 -13

ii
the ¡¬193 and ¡¬830_patent s claim three-dimensional synthetic biodegradable structures for growing tissue for vascularized_organs as well as methods for creating those structures
mit brought suit against shire in the united_states_district_court for the district of massachusetts alleging that shires sale of its dermagraftthe_r_scaffold infringes claims 1-4 6-9 and 15-16 of the ¡¬193_patent and claims 1-4 6 and 8 of the ¡¬830_patent
claim 1 of the ¡¬830_patent is illustrative and recites the following with emphasis given to the disputed terms 1
a cell-scaffold composition prepared in vitro for growing cells to produce functional_vascularized_organ_tissue in vivo comprising a fibrous three-dimensional_scaffold composed of fibers of a biocompatible biodegradable synthetic polymer ; and
cells derived from a vascularized_tissue attached in vitro to the surface of the fibers of the scaffold uniformly throughout the scaffold ; wherein the fibers of the scaffold provide sufficient surface area to permit attachment in vitro of an amount of the cells effective to produce the functional_vascularized_organ_tissue in vivo ; wherein the fibers of the scaffold are spaced apart such that the maximum distance over which diffusion of nutrients and gases must occur through a mass of cells attached to the fibers is between 100_and_300 microns ; and
wherein the diffusion provides free exchange of nutrients gases and waste to and from the cells uniformly attached to the fibers of the scaffold and proliferating throughout the scaffold in an amount effective to maintain cell viability throughout the scaffold in the absence of vascularization
'830_patent col. 24_ll._23 -46 emphases added

shires accused dermagraftthe_r_scaffold uses a synthetic bioabsorbable scaffold seeded with connective tissue cells called fibroblasts to grow the dermis or inner layer of skin for` the treatment of full-thickness diabetic foot ulcers'
j.a
1004
product literature for dermagraftthe_r describes that` [ d ] uring the manufacturing process the human fibroblasts are seeded onto a bioabsorbable polyglactin mesh *1115 scaffold'
id
after seeding onto the dermagraftthe_r_scaffold` [ t ] he fibroblasts proliferate to fill the interstices of this scaffold and secrete human dermal collagen matrix proteins growth_factors and cytokines to create a three-dimensional human dermal substitute containing metabolically active living cells'
id
the fibroblasts attach to the top bottom and sides of the fibers of the mesh scaffolding that after implantation is gradually absorbed by the surrounding tissue
according to mit shire uses a three-dimensional synthetic biodegradable scaffold to grow vascularized_organ_tissue and thus infringes the asserted claims of the ¡¬193 and ¡¬830_patent s

iii
the parties dispute whether prosecution_history_disclaimer applies to the asserted claims
in particular shire argues that prosecution_disclaimers apply to the terms` vascularized_organ_tissue' and` cells derived from a vascularized_tissue'
prosecution of the asserted patents began with their parent application u.s
application serial no._06 /933,018 filed in 1986 and abandoned in 1989
the ¡¬193_patent a continuation of the parent and the ¡¬830_patent a continuation-in-part of the parent both issued in 1998
during the intervening years mits strategy shifted in response to the examiners prior_art rejections and the claim_language evolved over the course of prosecution

as originally filed the pending claims in the ¡¬018_application were directed to [ p ] roviding a matrix formed of a biocompatible_material wherein said matrix is used to support cell_growth in a nutrient_solution said matrix being configured to allow adequate_diffusion of nutrients from the nutrient_solution to all of the cells so as to maintain cell_growth and proliferation to form a three dimensional_cell-matrix_structure
j.a
22231-32
an examiner rejected the ¡¬018_applications claims based on prior_art that according to the examiner` shows a tissue culture method on a carrier as claimed'
j.a
22212
in 1988 during an examiner interview in response to the prior_art rejection mit explained that the prior_art was directed to skin_substitutes
in particular mit described the prior_art as` limited to extremely thin_pieces of collagen_matrix for use in preparing skin_substitutes which could not be used to create organ_equivalents'
j.a
22234
this interview_summary further explained that` although porous structures for implantation have been made in the past the pores have not allowed adequate_diffusion through the matrix_material between the environment and the attached cells to support the growth and proliferation of cells on the interior of the matrix_material unless the dimensions of the matrix were very small'
j.a
22238
at the same time mit sought to amend the claims to recite a` matrix having adequate surface area to provide surfaces of attachment for a cell_suspension and a geometric configuration to uniformly support cell_growth in a nutrient_solution'
j.a
22231-32

dr._vacanti a co-inventor on the asserted patents submitted a declaration in 1989 in support of allowance of the ¡¬018_application explaining that the prior_art_methods relied on by the examiner to reject the claims were` limited to a very thin_layer of cells principally serving as skin_substitutes'
j.a
22268
he described the` key difference' between the claims and prior_art as` the design of a polymer scaffold which provides adequate sites for attachment and growth of enough cells to survive and function in vivo yet does not limit survival and growth of cells adjacent to the matrix surface as cells increase in number in vitro'
id
dr._vacanti further emphasized the` general applicability' of the invention *1116 which may be` use [ d ] with different_cell_types'
id

in response the examiner maintained his rejections of the ¡¬018_applications claims over prior_art disclosing skin_substitutes dismissing mits argument that` the claimed method is not a method for making very thin_structures'
j.a
22313
the examiner explained that the` claims herein are not exclusive to methods involving only thick_structures'
id
at that time the claims did not include a thickness_limitation and were directed to an artificial matrix for controlled cell_growth in a nutrient_solution comprising a biocompatible matrix configured to provide points of attachment for a cell_suspension said matrix being configured to uniformly support cell_growth in a nutrient_solution having sufficient area to allow adequate_diffusion of nutrients elimination of waste and adequate gas exchange from the nutrient_solution to all of the cells such that in the absence of a vascular network sufficient cellular growth and differentiation can occur to form a three dimensional_cell-matrix_structure
j.a
8142-43

in 1989 in response to these continued rejections mit amended the claims of the ¡¬018_application to limit the claims to scaffolds for growing` non-skin_organ_cells'
j.a
8142-43
likewise mit amended the claims in the applications that ultimately issued as the ¡¬830 and ¡¬193_patent s to claim respectively` [ a ] biodegradable polymeric support matrix for culturing non-skin_organ_cells' and` [ a ] method for preparing a biodegradable polymeric matrix that serves as a cell culture scaffolding for non-skin_organ_cells'
j.a
1866 3735
the examiner rejected all the new claims in each application under 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 reasoning that the` non-skin' limitations constituted new_matter that was not supported by the original patent_application
for example the examiner of the ¡¬193_patent_application stated claim 1 newly amended recites an invention that includes` non-skin' organ_cells
there is no description or teachings of enablement in the present_specification of` non-skin' organ_cells per se
consequently the present_specification as filed fails to meet the requirements of 35_usc_112 first_paragraph with respect to` non-skin' organ_cells
the term` non-skin' in claim 1 is deemed to be new_matter
j.a
3768193_patent ; see also j.a
8166 same rejection for ¡¬ 830 patent

mit then withdrew the` non-skin' amendments for the asserted patents
j.a
2272-73 3774-75 8173-74
in doing so mit emphasized that` no one prior to applicants recognized that the free_diffusion of nutrients and gases as opposed to cells in combination with structure and sufficient attachment sites for the number of cells required to replace lost function was essential to the formation of an organ replacement'
j.a
3789

mit abandoned the ¡¬018 parent application and continued to prosecute the applications that ultimately issued as the ¡¬193 and ¡¬830_patent s. at the time mits claims included a limitation directed to the thickness of the claimed cell_mass
for example claim 1 of the ¡¬193_patent recited` [ a ] method for preparing cell-matrix_structures comprising determining the thickness through which nutrients and oxygen can diffuse through an animal cell_mass for attachment and survival of the cells throughout the cell_mass wherein the dimensions of the cell_mass are greater than 300 microns'
j.a
1638
the examiner rejected the claims under 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 first_paragraph asserting that` [ t ] he original specification fails [ to ] contain adequate support for steps a and b of claim 1 and *1117 for dimensions of a cell_mass of greater than 300 microns'
j.a
4795
mit responded by pointing to support in the specification stating skin is differentiated from organs at page 6 of the application [ i.e. ¡¬193_patent_col. 2_l._64 -col. 3_l._17 ] where it is noted that it is considered to be such a thin structure that one does not have the limitations as to free_diffusion into the center of the tissue
...
it is clear from the foregoing_excerpts from the patent_application that construction of matrices for implantation of cells forming organs as opposed to skin are intended ; it is described that this is only a problem when the diffusion_distance to the middle is greater than 200_to_300 microns ; and that volumes of greater than two to three mm3 are intended to be implanted
j.a
1645
in that same_office_action_response mit distinguished prior_art` directed to formation of a skin substitute' on the ground that the prior_art structure` has only been used to make relatively thin_pieces of skin not organ structures'
j.a
1653

later during prosecution again in response to ¡± 112 rejections of claims with the` greater than 300 microns' limitation mit stated the specification identifies the problem to be solved as the need for structures replacing or supplementing tissue function specifically pancreatic liver intestine heart and skeletal or smooth muscle function pages 2-5
the failure of the prior_art to meet this need is reviewed at pages 5-6 noting that the prior_art only exemplified skin_replacement not replacement of organs..
the objects of the invention recited at page 7 make clear that it is the formation of thick_organ_structures that is the primary_goal of the invention
j.a
1709
similarly in the same_office_action_response applicants discussed the prior_art reference yannas which is directed to skin_substitutes` [ b ] ecause yannas et al
never makes a thick structure they do not recognize the inherent limitation of their collagen gels which prevent making thick_structures which are essential for making organs but not for making skin_replacements'
j.a
1716

in 1997 when the examiners continued to reject the claims directed to a cell_mass greater than 300 microns mit removed these thickness_limitations from the claims and again shifted its prosecution_strategy
specifically mit cancelled the pending independent claims and added claims in both the ¡¬193 and ¡¬830_patent s to require that the scaffold be used` to produce functional_vascularized_organ_tissue in vivo'
j.a
4972 9116
in an examiner interview_summary mit explained that` although the [ prior_art yannas ] lattice is uniquely suited for treating skin it would be unsuitable for carrying out the goal of the claimed invention especially when applied to vascularized_organs and structures that are thicker than skin'
j.a
9125
mit further described yannas as` suitable for skin repair or for regenerating nonvascular tissues'
j.a
9126
mit asserted that yannas could not` without serious modification be applied to the purposes of the presently claimed invention for producing vascularized_tissues and organs'
j.a
9126-27
mit also cited a report by yannas himself which stated that his matrix` supported regeneration of the epidermis i.e. the outer avascular layer of skin on top of the grafted lattices' but that it` induced only partial regeneration of the dermis-i.e. the vascularized component of skin'
j.a
9127
following minor amendments the ¡¬193 and ¡¬830_patent s issued in 1998 claiming structures for growing cells to produce functional vascularized *1118 organ_tissue and methods for creating those structures

iv
during claim_construction proceedings in the district_court shire argued that the term` vascularized_organ_tissue' should be construed to exclude skin as an organ based on various statements made during the prosecution of the asserted patents discussed above
shire made similar arguments regarding construction of the term` cells derived from a vascularized_tissue' arguing that mit had made statements during prosecution that limited the term to certain types of cells namely parenchymal_cells and bone forming cells
shire further argued that the term` three-dimensional_scaffold' was indefinite under 35 u.s.c.¡± 112
the district_court however determined that prosecution_history_disclaimer did not apply and additionally held that the term` three-dimensional_scaffold' was not indefinite

following the district_courts claim_construction and indefiniteness determinations shire stipulated to validity and infringement of the patents-in-suit and dismissed its declaratory judgment counterclaims of invalidity and noninfringement
the district_court accordingly entered judgment of validity and infringement and shire appealed
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

discussion
shire argues on appeal that the district_court erred in construing the term` vascularized_organ_tissue' simply as` vascularized_tissue from an organ' and in determining that the term` cells derived from a vascularized_tissue' encompasses` at least some cells derived from skin'
see j.a
3-4
shire also challenges the district_courts determination that the term` three-dimensional' is not indefinite as well as its construction of the term` three-dimensional_scaffold' to mean` a supporting structure that allows cells to attach along its width length and height'

we address each claim_limitation in turn below

i
the` ultimate interpretation' of a claim_term as well as interpretations of` evidence intrinsic to the patent the patent claims and specifications along with the patents prosecution_history' are legal conclusions reviewed by this court de novo

b
on the first term` vascularized_organ_tissue' the district_court determined that there was no clear and unmistakable_disclaimer that would exclude skin from the terms ordinary_meaning
the court therefore construed the term` vascularized_organ_tissue' according to its ordinary_meaning as` vascularized_tissue from an organ' reasoning that because` the dermal layer of skin contains blood_vessels this term encompasses skin'
j.a
3
we agree with the district_court

shire does not dispute that the ordinary_meaning of` organ' includes skin
similarly the ordinary_meaning of` vascularized_organ_tissue' includes skin because skin contains vascularized layers such as the dermis or inner layer
as mit points out the parties joint technology tutorial provided to the district_court as background during claim_construction expressly categorizes skin as an` organ' j.a
3379 3381 that is` vascularized' j.a
3383-84

the patents respective_specifications also support the district_courts determination that the term` organ' includes skin
the specifications explicitly state that` [ s ] kin is an organ subject to damage by disease or injury' and that skin is` considered anorgan of the body'
¡¬193_patent_col. 2_ll._31 64 ; see also ¡¬830_patent_col. 4_ll._8 -9 59
moreover the specifications state that` an object of the present invention' is` to provide a method and means for providing a variety of organs including skin liver kidneys blood_vessels nerves and muscles which functionally resemble the naturally occurring_organ'
¡¬193_patent_col. 3_ll._9 -13 emphasis added ; see also ¡¬830_patent_col. 5_ll._10 -14

shire nonetheless argues that skin should be excluded from the construction of` vascularized_organ_tissue' based on certain statements made by mit during prosecution of the asserted patents family
first shire pulls out a single sentence from the 1988 interview_summary prepared during prosecution of the parent ¡¬018_application which stated that the asserted prior_art` was limited to extremely thin *1120 pieces of collagen_matrix for use in preparing skin_substitutes which could not be used to create organ_equivalents'
j.a
22234
these statements however were made in the context of different claims that did not include the terms` vascularized_organ_tissue' or even` organ_tissue'
rather the claims were directed to` providing a matrix formed of a biocompatible_material'
j.a
22231
moreover the interview_summary particularly emphasized that` a crucial aspect of applicants invention' is that the scaffolds structure allows` adequate_diffusion through the matrix_material between the environment and the attached cells to support the growth and proliferation of cells on the interior of the matrix'
j.a
22238
reading the selected sentence in the context of the entire summary and the claim_terms then at issue reveals that mit emphasized the structure of the inventions scaffold not the type of organ it can be used to grow

shire also points to dr._vacantis 1989 declaration submitted during prosecution of the ¡¬018_application when the claims had been amended to require` determining the distance over which adequate nutrients and oxygen can diffuse through a cell_mass having dimensions of greater than 200 microns to maintain viability of the cells on the interior of the cell_mass'
j.a
2043
in particular shire relies on dr._vacantis statement that` [ w ] hile making skin equivalents does not require the use of thick layers of cells making functional organs in vivo does'
j.a
22268. review of the then-pending claims and dr._vacantis declaration in full however reveals that he did not distinguish the claims from the prior_art on the ground that organs do not include skin
rather dr._vacanti contrasted the prior_art from the then-claimed invention on the ground that the prior_art matrices can not support` cells [ that ] are grown to a thickness greater than the thickness which allows adequate_diffusion of oxygen and nutrients to [ the ] inner_cells'
id
dr._vacanti further explained that the claimed polymer matrices can be used` with different_cell_types' id
and that while his research focused on growing artificial livers` a great strength of our approach is the generic application of knowledge to other organ systems'
j.a
22286
a skilled_artisan would not read these statements in context as limiting the invention to any particular organ or as excluding skin

shire also points to dr._vacantis statement that the prior_art_methods were` limited to a very thin_layer of cells' whereas` the claimed method is not a method for making very thin_structures'
j.a
22268 2048
the declaration however was filed in support of claim_limitations requiring a matrix of a minimum thickness
no such limitation is present in the issued claims
in determining whether a clear and unambiguous disclaimer attaches to particular claim_language it is important to consider the statements made by the applicant both in the context of the entire_prosecution_history and the then-pending claims
see ecolab inc. v. fmc corp. 569_f.3d_1335 1342 fed
cir
2009` even if an isolated statement appears to disclaim subject matter the prosecution_history as a whole may demonstrate that the patentee committed no clear and unmistakable_disclaimer`
in the context of the overall prosecution_history the isolated statements plucked from dr._vacantis declaration do not meet the high standard for prosecution_disclaimer to attach

mits attempt to add the` non-skin' limitation during prosecution of the asserted patents reinforces our conclusion that the asserted claims as issued include skin within their scope
mit tried to narrow the application claims early in prosecution to exclude skin_organ_cells but the examiner rejected the` non-skin' limitation under *1121 ¡± 112 as new_matter
mit never again sought to limit the claims to exclude skin_organ_cells
had the examiner actually agreed with mits arguments and allowed the proposed amendments the claims could well have a different claim_scope
but the examiner did not and mit took a different approach
since claims to` vascularized_organ_tissue' were ultimately allowed over the prior_art without the proposed` non-skin' amendment it is difficult to infer that a skilled_artisan would interpret other isolated statements by mit during the course of the prosecution_history as a clear and unmistakable_disclaimer of claim_scope
rather we determine that a skilled_artisan reading the prosecution_history as a whole would conclude that mits invention does in fact cover vascularized skin

shire also points to a statement made by mit during prosecution of a related but ultimately abandoned patent_application
mit stated there that` [ t ] he prior_art describes the design of matrices for use as skin_replacements having different requirements than those of thick matrices required for organ function'
j.a
1913
the pending claims however required that the` dimensions of the cell_mass are greater than 300 microns'
j.a
1972
moreover mit described the pending claims as directed to` a method for the design and preparation of a matrix for the creation of thick organ_equivalents'
j.a
1912
in context shires reliance on mits statements is misplaced

shire similarly identifies statements made in 1995 during prosecution of the ¡¬193_patent to the effect that` construction of matrices for implantation of cells forming organs as opposed to skin are intended'
j.a
1645
again the pending claim_language at that time included a thickness_limitation requiring that the` dimensions of the cell_mass are greater than 300 microns'
j.a
1638
and these remarks were made in response to ¡± 112 rejections in which the examiner stated that the original application lacks support for the thickness_limitation
the full passage indicates that mit was merely showing the examiner where the specification provided support for the claim_limitation` greater than 300 microns' adequate support means that one of ordinary_skill in the art would be able to make and use the claimed invention
it is clear from the foregoing_excerpts from the patent_application that construction of matrices for implantation of cells forming organs as opposed to skin are intended ; it is described that this is only a problem when the diffusion_distance to the middle is greater than 200_to_300 microns ; and that volumes of greater than two to three mm3 are intended to be implanted
j.a
1645
mit thus directed the examiner to written description support in the specification which describes that` [ a ] lthough skin is considered to be anorgan of the body these methods for making artificial_skin have not been used to make other types of organs such as a liver or pancreas'

mits remarks were made in the context of a thickness_limitation not present in the issued claims and supported the notion that while the prior_art was limited to creating artificial_skin the invention is capable of creating skin and also has a broader application
moreover several paragraphs later the specification expressly states that an object of the invention is` to provide a method and means for providing a variety of organs including skin'
id
col. 3_ll._9 -11 emphasis added

finally shire_points to mits statement that` the prior_art only exemplified skin_replacement not replacement of organs'
j.a
1709
again this statement must be *1122 read in context
it was made when the claims included a thickness_minimum and mit attempted to distinguish the claims on that basis asserting that` it is the formation of thick_organ_structures that is the primary_goal of the invention'
id
( emphasis added
as such mits statement can not be read as limiting the ordinary_meaning of` vascularized_organ_tissue' in the issued claims which do not recite a thickness_minimum

we agree with the district_court that shire failed to meet its burden of demonstrating the existence of a` clear and unmistakable' disclaimer that would have been evident to one skilled in the art
see elbex video ltd. v. sensormatic elecs corp. 508_f.3d_1366 1371-72 fed
cir
2007
in the context of the entire_prosecution_history the statements that shire pulls out as alleged disclaimers regarding claim_limitations not present in the issued claims do not alter or disclaim the ordinary_meaning of` vascularized_organ_tissue' as used in the specification
we conclude that the district_court properly determined that` vascularized_organ_tissue' includes skin as an organ

c. we also agree with the district_courts construction of` cells derived from a vascularized_tissue' to include both parenchymal and non-parenchymal e.g. bone-forming cells

the claims themselves do not distinguish between parenchymal and non-parenchymal_cells
shire acknowledges that bone-forming cells a type of non-parenchymal cell fall within the claims scope
similarly shires expert agrees that the ordinary_meaning of` cells derived from a vascularized_tissue' would` encompass both the parenchymal and non-parenchymal_cells'
j.a
1320
in addition several dependent claims expressly include organs with parenchymal and non-parenchymal_cells
for example claim 11 of the ¡¬193_patent lists smooth muscle cells which are non-parenchymal stromal cells not parenchymal_cells

moreover the respective_specifications do not limit the term` cells derived from a vascularized_tissue' to parenchymal_cells but instead use the term to also refer to several types of non-parenchymal stromal cells namely cells forming smooth muscle and blood vessel endothelial cells
e.g. ¡¬193_patent_col. 4_ll._6 -16 col. 7_ll._39 -42 ; ¡¬830_patent_col. 6_ll._27 -34 col. 7_ll._51 -56
shire_points out that the specifications` repeatedly refer to the cells of the invention asparenchymalfunctional or cells possessing thenecessary ordesired function'
appellant_br
44
but shire has not shown that these descriptions are synonymous such that the invention should be limited to only_parenchymal_cells especially in the face of the broad ordinary_meaning of` cells derived from a vascularized_tissue'
and the specifications reference to` an advantage of the present method' being` a means for selective transplantation of parenchymal_cells' does not amount to a clear and unmistakable_disclaimer restricting the claims to only_parenchymal_cells
¡¬193_patent_col. 5_ll._56 -58 ; see also ¡¬830_patent_col. 9_ll._14 -18

finally shire pulls out statements from the prosecution of the ¡¬193_patent and a related_patent that it argues disclaim non-parenchymal_cells
the pending claims in these patent_applications at the time of the statements however did not include the limitation in dispute-' cells derived from a vascularized_tissue' -and do not clearly and unmistakably show that mit intended to limit the claims at issue to only_parenchymal_cells

for example shire quotes mits remarks made in response to a double patenting *1123 rejection during prosecution of the ¡¬193_patent
specifically mit stated that` there are two major differences between what appellants are claiming and the claims' in application no._07 /509,952 relating to cartilage including` the requirement for chondrocytes rather than parenchymal_cells'
j.a
1695-96
at the time of the double_patenting_rejection the claims pending in the application that ultimately issued as the ¡¬193_patent did not require the use of` cells derived from a vascularized_tissue' and dependent claim 14 specifically recited cells forming cartilage chondrocytes
j.a
4672-74
in response to the double_patenting_rejection mit amended the ¡¬193 application claims to require the formation of` vascularized_tissue' and removed claim 14s recitation of cartilage
the statements to which shire_points therefore simply distinguished the co-pending ¡¬952 application claims as being limited to cartilage which is an avascular tissue
a skilled_artisan would not read mits statements which distinguish avascular cartilage from vascularized_tissue made with parenchymal_cells as limiting the term` cells derived from a vascularized_tissue' to parenchymal_cells

shire also points to a statement made during prosecution of another related_patent in the family u.s. patent no._5770,417 where mit stated that` the types of cells described in the application are defined in medical dictionaries and textbook [ s ] asparenchymal cells'
j.a
1579
at that time the application that ultimately issued as the ¡¬417_patent had claims directed to` cells selected from the group consisting of parenchymal_cells from vascularized_tissue and cells forming bone'
j.a
1598
this remark was made in response to an indefiniteness rejection in which the examiner directed mit to identify support in the specification for the disclosure of` parenchymal_cells from vascularized_tissue'
mit referenced the specifications list of types of cells which included parenchymal_cells as well as non-parenchymal stromal cells in addition to general categories like intestine and kidney cells which would include both parenchymal and non-parenchymal_cells
mit later shifted its prosecution_strategy and removed the limitation of parenchymal_cells in the claims electing instead to require that the cells come from a vascularized_tissue

after reading the full prosecution_history in light of the then-pending claim_language we conclude that a skilled_artisan would not read mits statement made during prosecution of the ¡¬417_patent -and directed to very different claim_language-as limiting the term` cells derived from a vascularized_tissue' to parenchymal_cells
we like the district_court determine that the ordinary_meaning applies because shire has not shown that a clear and unmistakable_disclaimer attaches to limit the claim_scope

ii
finally shire appeals the district_courts determination that the term` three-dimensional_scaffold' is not indefinite as well as the courts ultimate construction of the term as` a supporting structure that allows cells to attach along its width length and height'
j.a
4
we affirm the district_courts validity determination and adopt its claim_construction

`` we review a district_courts ultimate determination that a claim is invalid as indefinite under 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
2 de novo although as with claim_construction any factual findings by the district_court based on extrinsic_evidence are reviewed for clear_error'

2016 internal footnote *1124 omitted2 a claim is invalid for indefiniteness if its language when read in light of the specification and the prosecution_history` fail [ s ] to inform with reasonable certainty those skilled in the art about the scope of the invention'

patents are presumed valid and the challenger bears the burden of establishing invalidity
see 35 u.s.c.¡± 282 ; nautilus 134 s.ct.at 2130 n.10

shire asserts that the term` three-dimensional_scaffold' is indefinite because the intrinsic record provides` no guidance' as to the meaning of` three-dimensional'
appellant_br
64
the district_court rejected this argument and construed the term` three dimensional' according to its accepted ordinary_meaning as confirmed by dictionary definitions
shire complains that the dictionaries cited by the district_court are from the present day and are not technical in nature
yet shire does not explain how technical dictionaries or dictionaries contemporaneous to the patents filing date would define the term any differently
moreover the district_courts construction is consistent with shires own_experts opinion regarding the terms ordinary_meaning at the time of the invention [ a ] t the time of the invention.. a posa would have had some familiarity with the phrases` two-dimensional' and` three-dimensional' in the context of growing cells.. at that time a posa would have understood the term` three-dimensional' as it relates to cell culture to refer to growing cells on and within a structure..
it is my understanding that a reference to three dimensions was an attempt to contrast this system i.e. growing on and within with the more traditional and widely-practiced` two-dimensional' conditions in which cells are grown in a single layer usually on a flat hard glass or plastic surface
j.a
1356

given the ordinary_meaning of` three-dimensional' and shires own_experts description of` three-dimensional_scaffold' we agree that the claim_language is sufficiently definite under nautilus
we likewise discern no error in the district_courts construction of` three-dimensional_scaffold' to mean` a supporting structure that allows cells to attach along its width length and height'
j.a

conclusion
for the above reasons we find no error in the district_courts claim_constructions of` vascularized_organ_tissue'` cells derived from a vascularized_tissue' and` three-dimensional_scaffold'
we affirm its determination that the term` three-dimensional_scaffold' is not indefinite
accordingly we affirm the district_courts judgment

affirmed

o'malley circuit_judge concurring
i agree with the majority that the district_court did not err either in its construction of the disputed claim_terms or in its conclusion that the term` three-dimensional_scaffold' was not indefinite
indeed i believe the district_court thoroughly and correctly analyzed all arguments and issues presented
i write separately however because i continue to believe that a judgment that is final except for a determination *1125 of damages and willfulness is not a final_judgment at all

discussion
the appellants assert that jurisdiction is proper because` [ t ] he judgment isfinal except for an accounting
`` appellants br
1 quoting 28 u.s.c.¡± 1292 c 2
this is apparently so` because aside from mits request for i damages and ii a finding of willful infringement the judgment disposes of all claims and counterclaims pending in the present case'
id

in robert bosch llc v. pylon manufacturing corp. 719_f.3d_1305_(fed._cir._2013) en banc we created a broad jurisdictional rule that excepts this court from the rules of finality followed by every other article iii court of appeals
we held that 28 u.s.c.¡± 1292 c 2` confers jurisdiction on this court to entertain appeals from patent infringement liability determinations when a trial on damages has not yet occurred' or` when willfulness issues are outstanding and remain undecided'
id.at 1317 1319
and while i fully understand that ¡± 1292 c 2 is an exception to the final_judgment_rule that applies only to patent_cases i do not believe we should have strayed so far from the wise judgment of our sister courts
see id.at 1331 o'malley j. dissenting collecting cases from other circuits holding that the finality_requirement applies to outstanding damages determinations

in declaring this broad new rule in bosch we framed the question as` whether a trial on damages and willfulness is an accounting for the purposes of ¡± 1292 c 2' and therefore an` exception [ ] to the final_judgment_rule'
id.at 1308
we answered that question by` conclud [ ing ] albeit incorrectly in my view that damages and willfulness determinations are sufficientlyministerial to constitute no more than anaccounting
`` eplus inc. v. lawson software inc. 789_f.3d_1349 1371 fed
cir
2015 o'malley j. dissenting
in so doing we hammered a square peg into a round hole-these appeals are more properly characterized as interlocutory and are therefore improper

it is well established that` [ t ] he finality_requirement.. embodies a strong congressional policy against piecemeal reviews and against obstructing or impeding an ongoing judicial proceeding by interlocutory appeals'
united_states v. nixon 418_u.s._683 690 94_s.ct._3090 41_l.ed.2d_1039_(1974)
yet this courts continuing practice of allowing parties to appeal judgments where damages and willfulness remain undecided multiplies judicial proceedings by endorsing piecemeal review
see dow chem co. v. nova chems corp. canada 809_f.3d_1223 1229 fed
cir
2015` [ bosch ] authorized nay encouraged parties to engage in piecemeal appeals in patent_cases and encouraged district judges to authorize the same'
( o'malley j. dissenting from denial of petition for rehearing en banc
this practice further incentivizes the disruption of district_court proceedings by encouraging` district_courts to bifurcate liability determinations from damages and willfulness trials-and all other remedial determinations' which will` drag out the litigation' in many cases` causing multiple appeals and probably multiple remands'

cir
2013 o'malley j. dissenting from denial of petition for rehearing en banc

the final_judgment_rule is invaluable to ensuring the efficient and just resolution of patent disputes
the final_judgment_rule serves several important interests
it helps preserve the respect due trial judges by minimizing appellate-court interference with the *1126 numerous decisions they must make in the pre-judgment stages of litigation
it reduces the ability of litigants to harass opponents and to clog the courts through a succession of costly and time-consuming appeals
it is crucial to the efficient administration of justice
flanagan v. united_states 465_u.s._259 263-64 104_s.ct._1051 79_l.ed.2d_288_(1984)
exceptions to that rule are rare and disfavored
dig equip corp. v. desktop direct inc. 511_u.s._863 868 1994
dig
the increasing regularity of appeals taken under ¡± 1292 c 2 with damages and willfulness yet to be decided demonstrates that the exception is indeed swallowing the general rule

conclusion
for these reasons while i understand i am bound by it i continue to believe that our decision in bosch was in error
i concur in the result reached by the majority on the merits but do not believe this court should continue its practice of exercising jurisdiction in cases where as here the district_court has yet to determine damages and/or willfulness
