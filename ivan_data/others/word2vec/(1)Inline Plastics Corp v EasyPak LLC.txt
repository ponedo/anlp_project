opinion
newman circuit_judge
inline plastics corporation sued easypak llc for infringement of united states patent no._7118,003 the ¡¬003_patent and no._7073,680 the ¡¬680_patent directed to tamper-resistant_plastic_food_containers
following the district_courts claim_construction inline moved for entry of final_judgment of non-infringement of its ¡¬003_patent on the premise that the claims as construed are not infringed
inline also granted easypak a covenant not to sue on the ¡¬680_patent
the district_court then entered final_judgment of non-infringement of the ¡¬003_patent dismissed without prejudice easypaks declaratory_judgment_counterclaims for invalidity and dismissed inlines count for infringement of the ¡¬680_patent with prejudice.1

inline appeals the district_courts construction of the claims of the ¡¬003_patent stating that the terms` frangible_section' and` tamper_evident_bridge' were incorrectly construed
we conclude that on the facts and specification of the ¡¬003_patent the district_court erred in limiting the claims to a specific embodiment for the invention as claimed is supported by the patents broader disclosure
we vacate the judgment of non-infringement of the ¡¬003_patent and remand for determination of infringement in accordance with the corrected claim_construction

the ¡¬003_patent
the patented products are plastic food containers having the described tamper-evident and tamper-resistant features
the containers have a hinged plastic bridge between the top and bottom portions of the container the bridge having a frangible_section that must be severed in order to open the container
thus tampering or opening of the container is readily evident

figure 1 of the ¡¬003_patent shows an embodiment of the tamper-resistant container having a cover_portion 12 and a base_portion 14 joined by a hinge 16
the hinge includes a tamper-evident pull strip 18 which upon removal severs the connection between cover 12 and base 14

?
*1367 the parties agree that claims 1_and_2 are representative 1
a tamper-resistant/evident_container comprising a a plastic transparent cover_portion including an outwardly extending peripheral flange ; b a base_portion including an upper_peripheral_edge forming at least in part an upwardly projecting bead extending substantially about the perimeter of the base_portion and configured to render the outwardly extending flange of the cover_portion relatively inaccessible when the container is closed ; and
c a tamper_evident_bridge connecting the cover_portion to the base_portion
2
a tamper-resistant/evident_container as recited in claim 1 wherein the tamper_evident_bridge includes a hinge joining the outwardly extending flange of the cover_portion with the base_portion the hinge including a frangible_section which upon severing provides a projection that extends out beyond the upwardly projecting bead of the upper_peripheral_edge of the base_portion for facilitating removal of the cover_portion from the base_portion to open the container
easypaks accused containers embody all of the elements of claims 1_and_2
however the easypak frangible_section has a single_score_line along which the cover is severed from the base whereas the ¡¬003_patents preferred_embodiment as shown in figure 1 has two score_lines at the frangible_section
the district_court construed` frangible_section' to mean` a removable_tear_strip delimited by at least two severable_score_lines'

jan._22,_2013` claim_construction_order'
the district_court acknowledged that it limited the claims to the embodiment shown in figure 1 and stated that` declarations made during patent prosecution to surpass the prior_art reveal a definitive focus on the removability of the frangible *1368 section and thus clearly and unambiguously disavow any other embodiment to the contrary'
claim_construction_order at *6
the district_court recognized that claims 1_and_2 did not contain a limitation to two severable_score_lines but reasoned that the prosecution_history supported this limitation
that is the issue on appeal

discussion
the district_courts claim_construction is reviewed as set forth in teva pharmaceuticals usa inc. v. sandoz inc. -- - u.s. -- -- 135_s.ct._831 -- - l.ed.2d -- -- 2015
`` [ w ] hen the district_court reviews only evidence intrinsic to the patent the patent claims and specifications along with the patents prosecution_history the judges determination will amount solely to a determination of law and the court of appeals will review that construction de novo'
id.at 841
relevant factual determinations based on extrinsic evidence such as prior_art and expert testimony are reviewed under the standard of clear error
id

a. frangible section
applying these criteria inline argues that` frangible_section' was incorrectly construed as requiring at least two score_lines at the hinge
inline states that` frangible_section' should be construed to mean a` section of material that includes at least one score_line or at least one perforation_line'
inline points out that nothing in the specification the prosecution_history or the prior_art limits` frangible_section' by the number of score_lines by which the frangible_section is severed

the ¡¬003_specification describes the inventions features as` intended to prevent and deter opening container 10 without first removing frangible_strip 18 from hinge 16'
¡¬003_patent col.5 ll.65-67
the specification describes the preferred_embodiment as preferably frangible_strip 18 is limited at least in part by a pair of parallel_score_lines 42 a 42 b or areas that have been weakened or stressed during the forming process
id.at_col.6 ll.24-26
the specification also states that a single_score_line or perforation is an alternative embodiment alternatively the integral hinge 16 could be formed with a single_score_line or perforation_line rather than a pair of score_lines
in this instance the single_score_line could be severed to create a pair of projections which would be used to open the container
id.at_col.6 ll.33-37

despite this explicit disclosure of an alternative single_score_line the district_court limited` frangible_section' to require at least two score_lines
no prior_art or prosecution argument underlays this limitation
the district_court referred only to the frequency with which the specification described the frangible_section as having two score_lines that form a severable strip

here the preferred_embodiment is not described as having certain unique characteristics of patentable distinction from other disclosed embodiments
nor are other embodiments inadequately described in relation to the principles of the invention
absent such traditional aspects of restrictive claim_construction the patentee is entitled to claim scope commensurate with the invention that is described in the specification
see phillips v. awh corp. 415_f.3d_1303 1313 fed.cir.2005 *1369` [ a ] lthough the specification often describes very specific embodiments of the invention we have repeatedly warned against confining the claims to those embodiments
``

easypak states that the prosecution_history supports construction of` frangible_section' to require at least two score_lines
this argument is devoid of support in the prosecution_history
the examiner did not require such limitation and it was not a condition of patentability
there is no prosecution_history disclaimer which requires clear and deliberate disavowal
see e.g. omega eng g inc. v. raytek corp. 334_f.3d_1314 1325 fed.cir.2003 ; storage tech corp. v. cisco sys. inc. 329_f.3d_823 833 fed.cir.2003` we therefore do not consider the applicants statement to be a clear and unambiguous disavowal of claim scope as required to depart from the meaning of the term provided by the written description
``

during prosecution the examiner initially rejected claims 1_and_2 as anticipated by either of u.s. patent no._5507,406 urciuoli or german patent de 7816353 menshen and rejections on the ground of obviousness were based on these references and also in view of u.s. patent no._4535,889 terauds
in response inline emphasized that no reference showed a frangible_section which upon severing` provides a projection that extends out beyond the upwardly projecting bead of the upper_peripheral_edge of the base_portion for facilitating removal of the cover_portion from the base_portion to open the container'
app
no._10_/895,687 amendment and response 15 jan._17,_2006
inline described urciuolis frangible_section as` a perforated line a groove or the like around the receptacle 210 in the outer segment 222'
id.at 9

easypak states that inline distinguished its invention from urciuoli on the basis that urciuolis frangible_section features a single perforated line
we can not find such a statement in either the reference or the prosecution_history
inlines description of uricuoli as containing a` perforated line a groove or the like' was not the basis of inlines distinction
to the contrary inline distinguished its invention from urciuoli on the basis that` [ n ] owhere in [ urciuoli ] is there any disclosure teaching or suggestion to modify the container therein to provide a tamper_evident_bridge that connects a cover_portion to a base_portion'
id

?
*1370 as depicted in urciuoli figure 2 the lid 250 nests within the edge or lip 222 of the container_portion 210
the frangible breakpoint 235 in urciuoli is located in this lip section that lies around the container
to open the container of urciuoli a user applies pressure to a handle 215 on the container_portion breaks the frangible_section and lifts the lid portion out from its nesting position in the container_portion

the device of the ¡¬003_patent unlike that of urciuoli has a hinge formed by outwardly extending edges on both the cover and base_portions
the distinction between urciuoli and the ¡¬003 device has no relation to the number of score_lines on a tear_strip but rather to differences in the structure and opening mechanism as a whole
the urciuoli structure indeed shows when tampering has occurred but by a different mechanism
the number of score_lines in the frangible lip of urciuoli is not part of the tamper-evidencing mechanism

easypak also argues that the declarations that inline submitted to the pto limit the claims to a tear_strip having two score_lines
that is an inaccurate description of the declarations
inline submitted a declaration of edward colombo a director on inlines board who described inlines commercially successful containers as having a frangible_hinge with a removable_tear_strip
app
no._10_/895,687 decl
of edward a. colombo 4 jan._17,_2006
his statements describe the commercial embodiments and focused on the long-felt need met by inlines commercial products the containers disclosed in this patent application meet the long-felt needs identified above because they utilize a geometry that is suitable for thermoforming containers from a sheet of plastic material
even more importantly the containers disclosed herein can be thermoformed from a single piece of material such as a single sheet of plastic
this material can be transparent
one of the structural features of the container that makes this single piece formation possible is the skirt that depends down from the peripheral rim of the container
this skirt is formed to have a vertical height that directly correlates with the height of a frangible_hinge that includes a tear_strip
*1371 id
mr._colombo did not address the number of score_lines in the frangible_section

in correspondence with the pto inline discussed the advantages of its structure
inline explained that by having a` cover that is very difficult to open without removing the tamper-evident_bridge connecting the cover to the base_portion pilferage is substantially reduced'
app
no._10_/895,687 supplemental response 3 mar._3,_2006
inline also filed a declaration of its vice president of sales august lanzetta and a statement from a customer arcade_industries inc
both mr. lanzetta and arcade_industries describe the inline containers as featuring removable_tear_strips
those declarations like that of mr._colombo focused on the commercial success of inlines product not the scope of the claims

the patent examiner placed no emphasis on the number of severable lines
in allowing the claims the examiner explained` the container also includes a tamper evident feature such as a tear_strip connecting the cover_portion to the base_portion'
app
no._10_/895,687 final rejection 2 june_19,_2006
there is no discussion in the specification or the prosecution_history of any patentability reliance on the number of score_lines by which the frangible_section is severed

thus inline proposes that the correct construction of` frangible_section' is` a section of material that includes at least one score_line or at least one perforation_line' and refers to the doctrine of claim_differentiation
see phillips 415 f.3d at 1315` [ t ] he presence of a dependent claim that adds a particular limitation gives rise to a presumption that the limitation in question is not present in the independent claim`
claim 2 of the ¡¬003_patent recited ante includes the frangible limitation the hinge including a frangible_section which upon severing provides a projection.. for facilitating removal of the cover_portion from the base_portion to open the container
claim 4 depends from claim 2 and is specific to the embodiment of two parallel_score_lines 4
a tamper-resistant/evident_container as recited in claim 2 wherein the frangible_section of the hinge is delimited at least in part by a pair of parallel_score_lines
since the specification explicitly mentions the` alternative' of` a single_score_line or perforation_line rather than a pair of score_lines' col.6 ll.33-37 there can be no debate concerning the application of the doctrine of claim_differentiation see tandon corp. v. u.s. int l trade comm n 831_f.2d_1017 1023 fed.cir.1987` there is presumed to be a difference in meaning and scope when different words or phrases are used in separate claims
``

thus we correct the district_courts claim_construction and construe` frangible_section' to mean` a section of material that includes at least one score_line or at least one perforation_line'

b
tamper evident bridge
the term` tamper_evident_bridge' was not in the ¡¬003_specification as filed
it was added to the claims during prosecution to distinguish the urciuoh reference
when the term was added inline explained that urciuoh does not show a tamper_evident_bridge that connects the cover to the base and that the container in urciuoh would have to be completely redesigned to accommodate the tamper_evident_bridge structure of the ¡¬003_patent

*1372 the district_court construed the term` tamper_evident_bridge' to mean` a structure that connects the lid and base_portions of the container and also contains a removable_tear_strip delimited by at least two severable_score_lines which once removed provides evidence that tampering has occurred'
claim_construction_order at *10
except for the limitation of two score_lines which derives from the district_courts construction of` frangible_section' we discern no error in this construction
thus we reconstruct` at least two' in the claim_construction_order to` at least one'

conclusion
we have corrected the claim_construction whereby claims 1_and_2 are not restricted to the presence of at least two score_lines or perforation_lines
on this claim_construction the judgment of non-infringement of the ¡¬003_patent can not stand
we vacate that judgment and remand for further proceedings based on the correct claim_construction as set forth herein

reversed in part vacated in part and remanded
