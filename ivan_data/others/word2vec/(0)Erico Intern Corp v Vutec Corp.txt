because this court finds that docs has raised a substantial_question as to the validity of the patent at issue this court vacates the preliminary_injunction

i. erico develops and manufactures a variety of fasteners used in the installation of electrical and communications cables for commercial buildings and other facilities
in particular erico sells a popular j-hook fastener
the j-hook offered in different strengths and sizes is a metal device that supports lengths of cable
erico through the inventor raymond scott laughlin obtained u.s. patent no._5740,994` the ¡¬994_patent` on its j-hook and the method for its use
the ¡¬994_patent issued on april 21 1998 from an application filed on december 26 1996
figure 6 of the ¡¬994_patent illustrates the j-hook

?
erico does not assert infringement of the apparatus claim to the j-hook but asserts claim 17 the method of using the j-hook
claim 17 reads a method of supporting a run of a bundle of low voltage communication cable comprising the steps of providing spaced supports each comprised of a curved saddle having smooth down-turned obtuse angle lateral edges suspending the run from saddle to saddle and spacing the saddles along the run so that the run sags between saddles no more than about 30 cm below the saddles
¡¬994_patent col.9 ll.61-67 emphasis added
figure 18 from the ¡¬994_patent illustrates the method *1353. ?
in january 2000 the united states patent and trademark office` pto' reexamined the ¡¬994_patent in reexamination no._90 /005,606
based on the reexamination the pto cancelled numerous apparatus claims on the j-hook
specifically the pto found the apparatus claims obvious under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 in light of three references-akashi et al
( jp ¡¬290 3-89290 sep. 11 1991 japanese kokai patent ; erico` for communications & low voltage applications' pp
3-26 1994 ; and obo bettermann publication p. 243 and` cable support clips' p. 18
ex parte raimond scott laughlin appeal no.2002-0244 heard on may_14,_2002
the board of patent appeals and interferences` board' affirmed the cancellations
claim 17 survived the reexamination process

docs manufactures a variety of hardware items and specifically manufactures and sells j-hooks
docs concedes that its j-hook copies ericos j-hook
in 2005 erico discovered that docs was selling a copy of its j-hook and informed docs
at first docs assured erico that it would not sell its existing j-hook inventory
docs also assured erico that it would refrain from future copying and selling of j-hooks
`` thereafter however [ docs ] sold the very products it promised to retain and continued to manufacture and sell knock off j-hooks'

erico filed suit to enjoin docs alleged infringement of claim 17 of the ¡¬994_patent
docs then challenged claim 17s validity

`` a decision to grant or deny a preliminary_injunction is based on the district_courts consideration of four factors 1 the likelihood of the patentees success on the merits ; 2 irreparable_harm if the injunction is not granted ; 3 the balance *1354 of hardships between the parties ; and 4 the public_interest

to show a likelihood of success on the merits erico must show a likelihood that docs infringes a valid claim of the ¡¬994_patent
see amazon.com inc. v. barnesandnoble.com inc. 239_f.3d_1343 1350 fed.cir.2001
from the other vantage point docs must show a substantial_question of invalidity to avoid a showing of likelihood of success
see phg techs. llc 469 f.3d at 1365

on may_3,_2006 the district_court granted ericos motion for a preliminary_injunction
initial_order
docs filed a motion for reconsideration
the district_court denied docs reconsideration motion
reconsideration_order
the district_court applied the correct four factor test with emphasis on the` likelihood of success' by citing to oakley inc. 316_f.3d_1331 in its initial_order and to ebay inc. v. mercexchange llc 547_u.s._388 126_s.ct._1837 164_l.ed.2d_641_(2006) in its reconsideration_order

in analyzing ericos likelihood of success on the merits the district_court considered docs three invalidity defenses- 1 inequitable_conduct by erico in obtaining the patent 2 on-sale_bar under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b and 3 obviousness under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103
first docs` argues that the ¡¬ 994 patent is invalid or otherwise unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct stemming from plaintiffs failure to disclose material information to the pto during the patents prosecution'
initial_order at 6
in particular docs says that erico did not disclose the 1990 eia/tia_standard that sets forth a spacing standard for open-top_cable_supports
however the district_court correctly found that docs did not prove intent to defraud the pto
therefore inequitable_conduct has not been shown to be a viable defense at this stage of the proceeding
id.at 7

with respect to the on-sale_bar defense docs` presented no evidence however that anyone actually practiced claim 17s method by using a j-hook more than one year prior to the filing_date of the ¡¬994_patent
on the record presented therefore ¡± 102 b likely does not apply'
id
( emphasis in original
once again this court sustains the trial_courts sound reasoning given the record at this stage of the proceeding

finally docs asserted` that claim 17 is invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 because the combination of a prior_art j-hook with the methodology outlined in claim 17 would have beenobvious as defined in the statute in light of everything that existed in the public domain before the patents filing_date'
id
docs specifically asserted that the obo_betterman_reference in combination with the 1990 eia/tia electronics industries alliance/telecommunications industry association spacing standards renders claim 17 obvious
according to the district_court` [ t ] heconforming standards identified in the patent are the very spacing requirements set forth in the 1990 eia/tia_standard'
id.at 8
however the district_court found docs obviousness defense likely to fail` because the [ pto ] had sufficient information before it during its prior examinations to assess the very obviousness claim [ docs ] now raises and because secondary considerations of nonobviousness cut in [ ericos ] favor'
id.at 8-9

after finding docs invalidity challenges did not raise a substantial_question and *1355 construing the claim the district_court found erico was likely to successfully prove that docs engaged in contributory infringement because the j-hooks sold by docs were especially adapted for hanging communication_cables as claimed and because docs failed to show that the j-hooks had any substantial non-infringing use
id.at 12
based on docs admitted copying and sale of j-hooks the district_court found that erico would suffer irreparable_harm if an injunction did not issue and that the balance of hardships heavily weighed in ericos favor
id.at 13-14
therefore the district_court granted the preliminary_injunction
docs appeals
this court has jurisdiction under 28 u.s.c.¡± 1292 a 1

on appeal docs specifically contends that claim 17 is invalid as obvious over the hook disclosed in the obo betterman prior_art reference when combined with the eia_standard
the obo betterman prior_art in the figure below shows a hook very similar to the j-hook with downwardly flared flanges along the hook saddle

?
in addition to the obo_betterman_reference docs cites to a specific section of the eia_standard as well as mr._laughlins testimony regarding cable installation practices
docs contends the combination of the obo_betterman_reference coupled with the eia_standard and mr._laughlins testimony raise a substantial_question as to the validity of claim 17
furthermore docs contends that the district_court misinterpreted the ptos consideration of the eia_standards proffered by docs to invalidate the ¡¬994_patent
the district_court reasoned that the pto had upheld the patents validity in light of the same prior_art i.e. the eia_standards during the reexamination no._90 /005,606 proceedings
however in granting a second_reexamination the pto stated that the` eia/tia standard was not cited in patent no._5740,994 or prior reexamination no._90 /005,606 ; obo was cited in the prior reexamination proceeding'
reexamination order 90/007,891 mar._2,_2006 emphases added
thus the pto cast_doubt on the district_courts finding that the` conforming standards' mentioned in the ¡¬994_patent are the same as the 1990 eia/tia_standard and that the pto had considered the 1990 standard during the first_reexamination
in sum docs contends that the grant of the second_reexamination request raises a substantial_question as to the validity of claim 17

erico on the other hand asserts that the district_court performed a proper obviousness analysis under ksr_international_co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 127_s.ct._1727 1742 167_l.ed.2d_705
according to erico that analysis shows that docs would most likely not prevail on its invalidity defense under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103
erico contends that the district_court had rejected docs obviousness invalidity challenge based on the ptos reexamination in view of the obo_betterman_reference and the disclosure of` conforming standards' in the ¡¬994_patent itself
furthermore erico argues that the district_court is not bound by the findings of the pto

iii
`` validity challenges during preliminary_injunction proceedings can be *1356 successful that is they may raise substantial_questions of invalidity on evidence that would not suffice to support a judgment of invalidity at trial'
amazon.com inc. 239 f.3d at 1358
in other words a defendant need not prove actual_invalidity
on the contrary a defendant must put forth a substantial_question of invalidity to show that the claims at issue are vulnerable
thus a showing of a substantial_question of invalidity requires less proof than the clear and convincing standard to show actual_invalidity
id

this court concludes that the obo_betterman_reference coupled with the eia_standards and mr._laughlins testimony mount a serious challenge to the validity of claim 17 of the ¡¬994_patent
first the obo_betterman_reference shows a hook_fastener with downwardly flared flanges nearly identical to the erico j-hook
the downwardly flared flanges implicitly point to the reasonableness of sag in cables installed by using obo_betterman_fasteners
second the eia_standard states the appropriate spacing used between open-top_cable_supports
the obo_betterman_fasteners and the j-hooks are similar to open-top_cable_supports in that cables are suspended between supporting members i.e. j-hooks rungs of an open-top_cable ladder
the applicable section of the eia_standard reads 4.6.5 cable support
where zone conduit or cable tray is not available in a suspended ceiling space and where telecommunications cables are allowed to be placed loosely in the ceiling adequate open-top_cable_supports located on 1222-1525-mm 48-60-in centers shall be provided
it is reasonable to see that downwardly flared flanges coupled with the eia spacing requirements could implicitly motivate a person of ordinary_skill to use j-hooks with the eia spacing to achieve cable sag of no more than about 30 centimeters
see ksr_int l_co. 127 s.ct.at 1743 ; dystar textilfarben gmbh v. c.h
patrick co. 464_f.3d_1356 1368 fed.cir.2006` [ t ] here exist [ s ] an implicit indeed common-sensical motivation to combine the two references
``

to further show common cable installation practices prior to the filing of the ¡¬994_patent application mr._laughlins testimony shows an implicit motivation to combine the prior_art
in part mr._laughlin testified q. im going to get to that in just a moment okay
more than a year prior to the filing_date of your patent was it a common practice for installers of communication_cables to pull the cable taut once they installed the cable between the supports if done in a workmanlike_fashion ?
a
yes if done in a workmanlike_fashion
q
were communication_cables installed more than a year prior to your patent filing_date in a workmanlike_fashion ?
a
there certainly were people installing them in a workmanlike_fashion and there were many people that were not
q
but there were at least some people that were installing them in a workmanlike_fashion ?
a
yes some
q
more than a year before your filing_date ?
a
yes
q
and you knew that when you filed your patent application ?
*1357 a
yes
q
when those installers who did install in a workmanlike_fashion more than a year prior to your filing_date in open top_cable_supports and pulled taut the sag would be less than 30 centimeters correct ?
a
yes if they were pulled taut
transcript of proceedings at 92-93 erico_int l_corp. v. docs mktg_. corp. 1:05-cv-2924 n.d.ohio mar._9,_2006
mr._laughlins testimony shows the reasonableness of installing cables using open-top_cable_supports with eia spacing standards resulting in less than 30 centimeters of sag
as such the obo_betterman_reference coupled with the eia_standards and mr._laughlins testimony raise a substantial_question of invalidity of claim 17

even assuming the accuracy of the district_courts secondary consideration analysis it is reasonable to infer that one of ordinary_skill would have considered the obo betterman hook coupled with the eia_standards and common knowledge within the art as shown by mr._laughlins testimony to explain that claim 17 is vulnerable based on invalidity
see ksr_int l_co. 127 s.ct.at 1742 ; amazon.com inc. 239 f.3d at 1358
thus docs invalidity challenge based on obviousness cast enough_doubt on the validity of claim 17 to negate likelihood of success on the merits as to infringement of a valid patent
at this point of course docs has only cast_doubt on the validity of the ¡¬994_patent
the district_court will have the opportunity to reach a final validity determination at trial

iv
accordingly this court vacates the district_courts grant of a preliminary_injunction

vacated

costs
each party shall bear its own costs

newman circuit_judge dissenting
i respectfully dissent from the reversal of the district_courts grant of a preliminary_injunction
the injunction preserves the status_quo during this litigation and is fully within the district_courts discretionary_authority
my colleagues on this panel have not only applied an incorrect standard to the preliminary_injunction factor of likelihood of success on the merits but they have also departed from the policy guidance of precedent including ebay inc. v. mercexchange l.l.c. 547_u.s._388 126_s.ct._1837 164_l.ed.2d_641_(2006) the traditional_criteria of equity apply to injunctions in patent cases and amoco production company v. village of gambell 480_u.s._531 107_s.ct._1396 94_l.ed.2d_542_(1987)` the standard for a preliminary_injunction is essentially the same as for a permanent injunction with the exception that the plaintiff must show a likelihood of success on the merits rather than actual success
``

the injunction pendente lite
the court explained in university of texas v. camenisch 451_u.s._390 395 101_s.ct._1830 68_l.ed.2d_175_(1981) that` [ t ] he purpose of a preliminary_injunction is merely to preserve the relative positions of the parties until a trial on the merits can be held'
see ugine & alz belgium v. united states 452_f.3d_1289 1297 fed.cir.2006 granting preliminary_injunction to maintain the status_quo pending disposition of the movants claims
the question here on appellate_review is whether the district_court abused its discretion in deciding to maintain the status_quo during this litigation
in *1358 doran v. salem inn 422_u.s._922 95_s.ct._2561 45_l.ed.2d_648_(1975) the court emphasized that appellate courts have limited review of preliminary_injunctions granted by district_courts stating that` while the standard to be applied by the district_court in deciding whether a plaintiff is entitled to a preliminary_injunction is stringent the standard of appellate_review of a preliminary_injunction is simply whether the issuance of the injunction constituted an abuse of discretion'
id.at 932 95_s.ct._2561
see also e.g. brown v. chote 411_u.s._452 457 93_s.ct._1732 36_l.ed.2d_420_(1973) court may only consider whether issuance of the preliminary_injunction constituted an abuse of discretion ;

the district_court decided that the status_quo should be preserved during this litigation
in overturning that decision the panel_majority mistakes the law misplaces the burdens misconstrues the assumptions and ignores the district_courts discretionary_authority and its balance of the equitable aspects
the panel_majority does not explain how the district_court abused its discretion nor is recognition given to the standard of review whereby as this court has stated` a decision granting a preliminary_injunction will be overturned on appeal only if it is established that the district_court made a clear_error of judgment in weighing relevant_factors or relied on incorrect law or on clearly erroneous_factual_findings'
novo_nordisk of north america inc. v. genentech inc. 77_f.3d_1364 1367 fed.cir.1996

the factors of equity
this court has well recognized as stated in illinois tool works inc. v. grip-pak inc. 906_f.2d_679_(fed.cir.1990) that` [ t ] his is only the first round involving only a preliminary_injunction a matter of equity 35 u.s.c.¡± 283 and requiring an evaluation and balancing of the four above-listed factors and the circumstances surrounding each
those factors and circumstances tend to overlap but none may be ignored en route to a determination of whether in the district_courts words it would be inequitable for an injunction to issue'
id.at 681 internal quotation marks omitted
in illinois tool the court recited the four traditional factors relevant to a preliminary_injunction viz
( 1 reasonable likelihood of success on the merits ; 2 irreparable_harm ; 3 balance of hardships ; and 4 the impact on the public_interest
id

the panel_majority gives no consideration to the equitable factors supporting the grant of this preliminary_injunction although the court has made clear that such factors apply
see ashcroft v. american civil liberties union 542_u.s._656 666 124_s.ct._2783 159_l.ed.2d_690_(2004) the equitable issues are highly relevant at the pre-trial stage
in camenisch the court explained that when the decision on the merits is unclear at the preliminary_stage or the record too sparse for confident determination the decision is based` not on the ultimate merits of [ the plaintiffs ] case but rather on the balance of the canal authority factors'
451 u.s. at 398 101_s.ct._1830
these factors are described by the court as` whether the plaintiff will be irreparably harmed if the injunction does not issue ; whether the defendant will be harmed if the injunction does issue ; whether the public_interest will be served by the injunction ; and whether the plaintiff is likely to prevail on the merits'
id.at 392 101_s.ct._1830 citing canal authority of fla. v. callaway 489_f.2d_567_(5th_cir.1974)
these factors have been well recognized by this court
e.g. sanofi-synthelabo v. apotex inc. 470_f.3d_1368_(fed.cir.2006) ; helifix ltd. v. *1359 blok-lok 208_f.3d_1339_(fed.cir.2000)
although the majority opinion recites as` background' that` the district_court found erico would suffer irreparable_harm if an injunction did not issue and that the balance of harms weighed heavily in ericos favor' maj. op.at 1355 that is the opinions last mention of any equitable factor
the district_court however discussed and applied them in its decision that the patent right should be preserved until the defense of invalidity is decided

as precedent teaches equitable principles are at least as relevant when the trial_court must consider the situation at the pre-trial stage before the evidence has been tested
it is not correct that it suffices to` cast_doubt' or` raise a question' about a patents validity as the court today holds

the casting of doubt
as discussed in gonzales v. o centro espirita beneficente uniao do vegetal 546_u.s._418 429 126_s.ct._1211 163_l.ed.2d_1017_(2006)` the burdens at the preliminary_injunction stage track the burdens at trial'
for issues on which the defendant will bear the burden of proof at trial that burden also applies at the preliminary_injunction stage
id
the district_court considering the placement and burdens of proof found that erico showed its likelihood of success on the issue of infringement-indeed copying and infringement were conceded-and that the defendants had not established their likelihood of success on the issue of invalidity
the panel_majority ignoring the district_courts reasoning as well as its discretionary_authority finds that a` substantial_question' of invalidity was raised by the defendants
the panel_majority states that it suffices to` cast_doubt' to` show that the claims are vulnerable' to reverse the district_courts preliminary_injunction

my colleagues have applied an incorrect criterion
the correct criterion is not whether there is a` substantial_question' ; it is whether the defendants have shown that they are likely to succeed on the merits on the standards and burdens of proof as would prevail at trial
in gonzales 546 u.s. at 429 126_s.ct._1211 the court emphasized that the burdens of proof do not change
initially the movant has the burden of coming forward to support the motion ; the federal_circuit has recognized this procedure e.g
sanofi-synthelabo 470 f.3d at 1374` [ the movant ] must demonstrate that in light of the presumptions and burdens that will inhere at trial on the merits [ the movant ] will likely prove that [ defendant ]s product infringes the ¡¬265_patent and that it will withstand [ defendant ]s challenges to the validity and enforceability of the ¡¬265_patent'
however this does not relieve the attacker from the requirement of showing the likelihood of success in invalidating the patent on application of the presumptions and the placement and burden of proof

as used by my colleagues the raising of a` substantial_question' does not require a preponderance of the evidence although it requires` more than a mere scintilla'
see universal camera corp. v. nlrb 340_u.s._474 477 71_s.ct._456 95_l.ed._456_(1951)
raising a` substantial_question' concerning validity is not the same as establishing the` likelihood' of establishing invalidity
precedent is clear that the standard is the likelihood of success at trial with recognition of the presumptions and burdens
see e.g. gillette co. v. energizer holdings inc. 405_f.3d_1367 1370 fed.cir.2005 ; nat l steel car ltd. v. canadian pac
ry. ltd. 357_f.3d_1319 1325 fed.cir.2004 ; ranbaxy pharms. inc. v. apotex inc. 350_f.3d_1235 1239 fed.cir.2003 ; *1360 purdue pharma l.p. v. boehringer ingelheim gmbh 237_f.3d_1359 1363 fed.cir.2001 ; smith international inc. v. hughes tool_co. 718_f.2d_1573 1579 fed.cir.19831

the district_courts decision
the district_court considered the evidence as provided at this pre-trial stage and applied the correct standard
the court construed the claims discussed the prior_art including the 1990 eia/tia_standards considered the results of the first_reexamination and acknowledged the pending second_reexamination
the district_court referred to the patentees commercial success and the defendants admitted copying
the significance of objective evidence in determining patent validity was emphasized in ksr inc. v. teleflex 550_u.s._398 127_s.ct._1727 1734 167_l.ed.2d_705 2007 the court reminding us of its ruling in graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 17-18 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966) that such evidence aids in understanding how an invention was viewed by contemporaries in the field of the invention
the district_court considered the relative simplicity of the invention a factor that appears to have influenced my colleagues who with perfect hindsight find that it would have been obvious to make ericos j-hook by combining the obo betterment reference the eia_standards and mr._laughlins testimony
my colleagues mention only the evidence against the patent-as if reviewing a jury_verdict after it has been rendered
see anderson v. liberty lobby inc. 477_u.s._242 106_s.ct._2505 91_l.ed.2d_202_(1986) jury_verdict must be sustained if supported by substantial evidence
however the question is whether the defendants are likely to prove invalidity at trial not whether they` cast enough_doubt on the validity'
maj. op.at 1357

the district_court discussing the balance of harms referred to ericos argument that if it is ultimately ruled that the defendants were improperly enjoined they can be made whole by money damages ; while if the defendants are not enjoined erico will experience price and market erosion from which erico is unlikely to recover should it prevail at trial
erico points out that the defendants were previously serving this same market with other products and can continue to do so
this is not a case in which the patent is so conspicuously invalid that invalidity outweighs all of the equitable considerations and demands immediate relief ; such a situation should produce summary judgment not trial

the panel_majority errs in disregarding the traditional_criteria of the grant and review of a preliminary_injunction
abuse of discretion has not been shown in the district_courts consideration and weighing of the relevant_factors at this preliminary_stage
i must respectfully dissent

the federal_circuit has used the word` substantial' in the context of the preliminary_injunction but this usage although loose has not changed the obligation to show the likelihood of success nor has it inverted the burden of proof
this is illustrated in sanofi-synthelabo v. apotex inc. 470_f.3d_1368_(fed.cir.2006) where this court explained that` in light of the deferential standard we apply in reviewing grants or denials of preliminary_injunctions and mindful that a patent is presumed valid and this presumption exists at every stage of the litigation we conclude that the district_court did not clearly err in finding that [ the patentee ]s anticipation defense lacks substantial merit'
