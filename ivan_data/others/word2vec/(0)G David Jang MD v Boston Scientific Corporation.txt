this dispute between g._david_jang m.d
( dr._jang and boston scientific corp. and scimed_life_systems inc. collectively bsc more than a decade old returns to us for a fourth time
in the latest appeal of this case involving u.s. patent no._5922,021021_patent and bscs sales of several coronary_stents collectively express_stent dr._jang challenges the district_courts denial of his motion for judgment as a matter of law jmol on the ground that no reasonable_jury could have found that bscs express_stent did not literally infringe claims 1_and_8_(the_asserted_claims) of the021_patent
dr._jang also challenges the district_courts vacatur of the jurys finding that the express_stent infringed the asserted claims under the doctrine of equivalents as well as the entry of judgment of non-infringement in favor of bsc on the ground that the district_court incorrectly held that he failed to provide an acceptable_hypothetical_claim for an ensnarement_analysis and thereby failed to prove that his doctrine of equivalents_theory did not *1279 ensnare the prior_art
dr._jangs appeal is accompanied by a purported cross-appeal from bsc which assigns error to the district_courts holding that bsc was contractually obligated to pay royalties for past_sales of the express_stent if it infringed the asserted claims notwithstanding the u.s. patent and trademark offices pto eventual_cancellation of them in an ex parte_reexamination

because we affirm the district_courts denial of dr._jangs motion for jmol its vacatur of the jury_verdict of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents and its entry of judgment of non-infringement we dismiss bscs cross-appeal and need not reach the arguments it raised

introduction
a
the021_patent
dr._jang is the named inventor of the021_patent which is generally directed to a coronary_stent
a representative embodiment of the claimed stent is below

?
'021_patent fig._9 d annotated
inside the dotted boxes are expansion_columns made up of a plurality of pairs of expansion struts
the solid box outlines a connecting strut_column made up of connecting struts
each connecting strut has i a section at the` proximal' end that connects to an expansion_strut_pair in one expansion_column ; ii a section at the` distal' end that connects to an expansion_strut_pair in another expansion_column ; and iii an intermediate section that is not parallel to the two end sections
see e.g. id
col. 13_ll._5 -18 38-48
given the connecting struts proximal and distal connections each connecting strut links expansion_strut_pairs from two expansion_columns in a` peak-to-peak' configuration
the connecting struts are designed to increase the longitudinal flexibility of the stent
see id
col. 6_ll._29 -36 ; id
col. 8_ll._45 -47
independent claim 1 is representative of the asserted claims 1
a stent in a non-expanded state comprising a first_expansion_strut_pair including a first_expansion_strut positioned adjacent to a second_expansion_strut and a joining *1280 strut of the first_expansion_strut_pair that couples the first and second_expansion_struts at a distal_end of the first_expansion_strut_pair a plurality of the first_expansion_strut_pair forming a first_expansion_column ; a second_expansion_strut_pair including a first_expansion_strut positioned adjacent to a second_expansion_strut and a joining strut of the second_expansion_strut_pair that couples the first and second_expansion_struts of the second_expansion_strut_pair at a proximal_end of the second_expansion_strut_pair a plurality of the second_expansion_strut_pair forming a second_expansion_column ; a first_connecting_strut including a first_connecting_strut_proximal_section a first_connecting_strut_distal_section and a first_connecting_strut_intermediate_section the first_connecting_strut_proximal_section being coupled to the distal_end of the first_expansion_strut_pair in the first_expansion_column and the first_connecting_strut_distal_section being coupled to the proximal_end of the second_expansion_strut_pair of the second_expansion_column a plurality of the first_connecting_strut forming a first_connecting_strut_column that couples the first_expansion_column to the second_expansion_column the first_connecting_strut_intermediate_section being nonparallel to the first_connecting_strut proximal and distal sections wherein the first_expansion_strut of the first_expansion_strut_pair in the first_expansion_column has a longitudinal_axis offset from a longitudinal_axis of the first_expansion_strut of the second_expansion_strut_pair in the second_expansion_column

b. bscs express stent
the express_stent comprises two types of alternating columns or` elements' -referred to as` macroelements' and` microelements' -that are joined together
micro-elements depicted inside the box in the schematic below are smaller and narrower than the macroelements on either side of the microelements
the microelements include horizontal bars that join the microelements and the macroelements together in a` peak-to-valley' configuration

?
c. litigation history
in 2002 dr._jang executed an agreement assigning the021_patent and another related patent to bsc and in return bsc agreed to pay dr._jang about $ 50 million
pursuant to the agreement under certain conditions dr._jang was entitled to certain royalty payments up to about $ 110 million if bsc ever developed and sold a coronary_stent that was covered by i.e. would infringe,2 jangs patented technology

*1281 in may 2005 dr._jang commenced this case against bsc asserting that bscs express_stent was one such stent and consequently bsc owed royalties associated with the sales of the express_stent that bsc had already made
many years after dr._jang filed suit in october 2013 bsc requested an ex parte_reexamination of the asserted claims before the pto

in conjunction with its reexamination request bsc sought leave to amend its answer to include invalidity_defenses under the theory that the assignment_agreement should be interpreted so as to relieve bsc of any obligation to pay royalties for already-made sales of its express_stent if the asserted claims were determined to be invalid or unpatentable
see j.a.at 6091
the district_court denied bsc leave to amend deeming any invalidity_defenses` irrelevant' as to whether bsc owed dr._jang royalties for past_sales under the terms of the assignment_agreement
id
the district_court reasoned that bscs interpretation of the assignment_agreement` would lead to an absurd result namely that bsc could avoid payment.. under the [ a ] greement even if the [021_patent ] [ were ] declared invalid years after the [ royalty ] payments were due'
id

bsc then moved for summary_judgment using the same tack after the pto cancelled the asserted claims as unpatentable in the ex parte_reexamination
see id.at 50-56
bsc contended that it owed dr._jang no royalties under the assignment_agreement even if they had accrued well before the cancellation because unpatentable claims can not be infringed
see id.at 50
the district_court denied summary_judgment holding that bsc still owed royalties to dr._jang for any past_sales of stents covered by the asserted claims under the assignment_agreement despite the ptos subsequent cancellation of those claims
see id.at 50-56

the parties then proceeded to trial as to whether the express_stent infringed the asserted claims of the021_patent
before trial bsc moved in limine to preclude dr._jang from presenting a doctrine of equivalents_theory to the jury accusing him of merely rehashing his literal_infringement theory in the guise of a doctrine of equivalents_theory and thus failing to provide particularized testimony as to how the express_stent is insubstantially different than the asserted claims
see id.at 66-69
the district_court denied the motion finding that dr._jangs experts michael j. lee and nicolas a.f
chronos m.d. sufficiently explained his doctrine of equivalents_theory in their expert reports
see id.at 68-69

collateral to this motion in limine was bscs invocation of an ensnarement_defense
see id.at 9-12
bsc insisted that dr._jangs doctrine of equivalents_theory would ensnare the prior_art referencing three prior_art patents
see id.at 11
the district_court decided to conduct a post-trial ensnarement_hearing if the jury returned a verdict of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
see id.at 12207

the jury ultimately found no literal_infringement but found infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
following through on its earlier decision the district_court conducted an evidentiary_hearing on ensnarement
dr._jang objected asserting that bsc belatedly raised ensnarement and thus waived it
see id.at 9-12 ; see also id.at 34
the district_court found no waiver
see id.at 9-12

*1282 on the merits of the ensnarement_inquiry dr._jang elected to use a hypothetical_claim_analysis to establish a range of equivalents to which he believed he was entitled above and beyond the actual scope of his asserted claims
see id.at 12-19
in other_words he attempted to construct a hypothetical_claim-predicated on representative_claim 1-that would be broad enough to literally cover bscs express_stent yet not so broad that it would be unpatentable over the prior_art
see e.g. intendis gmbh v. glenmark pharm inc. usa 822_f.3d_1355 1363-64 fed
cir
2016
in the course of trying to draft such a hypothetical_claim dr._jang constructed approximately ten different claims and ultimately chose to assert two of them hypothetical_claim three and hypothetical_claim five
see j.a.at 14-19
the district_court concluded however that dr._jang failed as a threshold_matter to draft a proper_hypothetical_claim for the ensnarement_analysis
see id
the district_court rejected hypothetical_claim three because it impermissibly narrowed claim 1 and hypothetical_claim five because it failed to broaden claim 1 at all
see id
because dr._jang did not meet his burden of persuasion which includes providing a proper_hypothetical_claim that does not ensnare the prior_art the district_court vacated the jury_verdict of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents and entered judgment of non-infringement in favor of bsc
see id.at 18-19

dr._jang then moved for jmol with respect to inter alia literal_infringement
see id.at 23-32
the district_court found substantial_evidence to support the jurys verdict of no literal_infringement concluding that the jury could have reasonably found either that the express_stents microelements corresponded to the claimed expansion_columns rather than the claimed connecting strut_columns or that the express_stents macroelement first_expansion_column was connected to the microelement second_expansion_column in a` peak-to-valley' configuration instead of a` peak-to-peak' configuration
see id.at 27
dr._jang also moved for a new_trial asserting several bases all of which the district_court rejected
see id.at 33-35

dr._jang appeals the district_courts denial of his jmol for literal_infringement as well as his motion for a new_trial and its vacatur of the jury_verdict of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
bsc purports to cross-appeal the district_courts denial of its summary_judgment motion
we have jurisdiction over dr._jangs appeal pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1 2012

discussion
a. literal infringement
the parties do not dispute that the express_stents macroelements literally meet all expansion_column-related limitations of claim 1 leaving them to contest only whether the jury had a reasonable basis to find that the express_stents microelements do not meet all connecting strut-related limitations in the claim
dr._jang maintains that a reasonable_jury could not have found no literal_infringement in this limited context because the undisputed facts showed otherwise and bscs non-infringement arguments were legally erroneous
at the very least according to dr._jang he is entitled to a new_trial that is not tainted with the legally erroneous arguments
we disagree with dr._jangs arguments

denials of motions for jmol or a new_trial are reviewed according to the law of the regional circuit-here the ninth_circuit

molski v. m.j. cable inc. 481_f.3d_724 729 9th_cir
2007

dr._jang contends that the district_court erred in denying his motion for jmol because it failed to consider whether dr._jang proved that the express_stents microelements were connecting strut_columns notwithstanding the fact that they may also be expansion_columns
in other_words that there was sufficient_evidence for the jury to find that the express_stents microelements were expansion_columns is irrelevant to the resolution of his motion for jmol dr._jang argues so long as he showed that the microelements were connecting strut_columns
see appellant_br.at 55` if the [ microelements ] satisfy the claim terms of a connecting-strut_column then they are connecting-strut_columns for literal_infringement purposes regardless of whether they might also be considered something else such as expansion_columns`
dr._jang also maintains that the district_court erred in denying his motion for jmol because bscs arguments rest on legally erroneous premises and so they can not support the jurys verdict of no literal_infringement

the issue of literal_infringement was a question of fact for the jury
the jury heard dr._jangs theory of infringement and his supporting evidence but nevertheless found that the express_stent did not literally infringe
the district_court did not fail to consider dr._jangs theory of infringement and it correctly found substantial_evidence to support the jurys finding that the express_stents microelements do not literally meet the connecting-strut-column-related limitations in claim 1
see j.a.at 25-28
bscs expert james moore ph.d. testified that the express_stents macroelements and the microelements were more akin to the claimed expansion_columns than the claimed connecting strut_columns in the asserted claims because both elements expand the express_stent when needed which causes foreshortening of the stent
see id.at 9330-43 9389-90
these elements stood in contrast to the claimed connecting strut_columns that do not expand when the claimed stent expands and instead compensate for the foreshortening caused by the expansion of the claimed expansion_columns
see id
moreover the express_stents macroelements and microelements are joined together in a` peak-to-valley' configuration by a connecting strut with a parallel_intermediate_section i.e. a straight horizontal connector-as opposed to the claimed expansion_columns that are joined in a *1284` peak-to-peak' configuration by a connector with a nonparallel_intermediate_section.3 see id
dr._jangs experts conceded as much
see id.at 8877-79 mr._lee acknowledging that the express_stents microelements could be expansion_columns ; id.at 8869-73 mr._lee recognizing that the express_stents microelements and macroelements could be viewed as being joined by straight_connectors ; id.at 9260-61 dr._chronos acknowledging that the express_stents microelements behave like expansion_columns ; id.at 9284-85 dr._chronos recognizing that if the express_stents microelements and macroelements are viewed as expansion_columns then they are joined by a straight connector
the jurys verdict of no literal_infringement therefore is supported by substantial_evidence

dr._jang failed to persuade the district_court that bscs non-infringement arguments were legally erroneous
we are similarly unpersuaded
dr._jang characterizes bscs position as one of mutual exclusivity and argues that this purported`either/or position effectively imported a negative limitation into the definition ofconnecting strut_column
`` appellant reply br.at 33
dr._jang misrepresents bscs non-infringement arguments
bsc did not argue as dr._jang contends that microelements could only be deemed either exclusively expansion_columns or exclusively connecting strut_columns
rather bsc fairly argued at trial that the microelements like the macroelements simply are expansion_columns
j.a.at 8413-14 10573
in particular bsc argued that there was no literal_infringement because those two expansion_columns are joined by straight_connectors in a peak-to-valley configuration
id.at 10570 11366

dr._jang also contends that bsc misled the jury to find no literal_infringement because bsc told the jury that the express_stents microelements could not be the claimed connecting strut_columns due to the presence of` extra_metal' in the microelements that is not recited in the asserted claims
this was erroneous according to dr._jang because the asserted claims use the transitional_phrase` comprising' i.e. open-ended claim language and so the addition of` extra_metal' in the express_stent can not preclude a finding of literal_infringement
but this was not one of bscs non-infringement positions at trial
to the extent that bsc introduced this` extra_metal' concept to the jury bsc did so not as an alternative non-infringement position but as an explanation that dr._jangs experts ignored certain structural features of the express_stent in their infringement analyses thereby undermining the strength of their testimony on whether the microelements were connecting strut_columns
see id.at 9343 10579-80

in sum a reasonable_jury could have returned a verdict of no literal_infringement based on the evidence presented at trial
we consequently have no basis to order a new_trial

b. ensnarement in view of a hypothetical claim
in an appeal relating to the doctrine of equivalents a party often challenges the fact finding made below of infringement or no infringement under that doctrine which is usually analyzed under the well-established` substantially the same function-way-result' or` insubstantial differences' inquiry
here however the jurys finding that the express_stent satisfies each claim_element of the asserted claims under the doctrine of equivalents is not on appeal
instead this appeal centers on the district_courts application of a limitation *1285 on the reach of the doctrine known as` ensnarement'

dr._jang insists that the district_court erred in several respects in overturning the jurys verdict of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents based on bscs ensnarement_defense
dr._jang argues that his hypothetical_claims three and five are properly broader in scope than representative_claim 1 and if they were flawed the district_court was required to proceed with an ensnarement_analysis even if that meant the district_court would have to devise an acceptable_hypothetical_claim for dr._jang that was broader in scope than representative_claim 1
dr._jang is wrong on both counts

a doctrine of equivalents_theory can not be asserted if it will encompass or` ensnare' the prior_art

intendis 822 f.3d at 1363 citing depuy 567 f.3d at 1324

the district_court correctly concluded that dr._jangs hypothetical_claims three and five were flawed and properly declined to conduct any hypothetical_claim_analysis as a result
see j.a.at 12-19
dr._jangs hypothetical_claim three reads the first_connecting_strut_intermediate_section being non parallel to the first_connecting_strut proximal and distal sections column configured to provide increased flexibility compared to the first and second_expansion_columns
id.at 14 strikethrough and emphasis to reflect amendments to claim 16 although hypothetical_claim three is broader than claim 1 by deleting the non-parallel_intermediate_section limitation thereby encompassing connecting struts with a parallel_intermediate_section it also is narrower by adding the requirement that the connecting strut_column must provide more flexibility as compared to the expansion_columns
our precedent has been clear however that a patentees hypothetical_claim may not add any narrowing limitations
see streamfeeder 175 f.3d at 983` while use of a hypothetical_claim may permit a minor extension of a claim to cover subject matter that is substantially equivalent to that literally claimed one can not in the course of litigation and outside of the pto cut and trim expanding here and narrowing there to arrive at a claim that encompasses an accused device but avoids the prior_art
slight broadening is permitted at that point but not narrowing`
whereas claim 1 previously covered embodiments where the connecting strut_column has the same or lesser degree of flexibility when compared to the first and second_expansion_columns hypothetical_claim three narrows claim 1 so that the connecting strut_column must have an increased degree of flexibility when compared to the first and second_expansion_columns
see j.a.at 16
the district_court thus correctly rejected dr._jangs hypothetical_claim three

dr._jang contends that the combination of the added comparative_flexibility_limitation with the deletion of the non-parallel_intermediate_section limitation results in an overall broader claim scope than claim 1 because in his view the comparative_flexibility_limitation recites the function that the non-parallel_intermediate_section of the connecting strut is designed to achieve
in other_words dr._jang argues that he simply is replacing a structural_limitation for a functional limitation that encompasses the structural_limitation as well as all other structures that perform that function
but this argument is problematic because nothing in the021_patent or elsewhere in the record indicates that the claimed connecting strut_columns provide increased flexibility in comparison to the claimed expansion_columns
although the specification explains that the connecting strut_columns improve a particular form of flexibility i.e. longitudinal of the stent as a whole see021_patent col. 6_ll._29 -36 ; id
col. 8_ll._45 -47 it never discusses the flexibility of the connecting strut_columns vis-a -vis the expansion_columns
we thus can not agree with dr._jang that the limitation he added in hypothetical_claim three is merely a broader version of the limitation he deleted from claim 1

as for dr._jangs hypothetical_claim five it reads a first_connecting_strut including at least a first_connecting_strut_proximal_section *1287 a first_connecting_strut_distal_section and a first_connecting_strut_intermediate_section [ ]
j.a.at 17 emphasis to reflect amendment to claim 1
this hypothetical_claim does not broaden claim 1 at all
claim 1 already uses the transitional_phrase` comprising' to establish an open-ended claim
see e.g. vehicular techs corp. v. titan wheel int l inc. 212_f.3d_1377 1383-84 fed
cir
2000` a drafter uses the termcomprising to mean i claim at least what follows and potentially more
``
thus the addition of` at least' to hypothetical_claim five is redundant with claim 1s recitation of` comprising'
in short hypothetical_claim five and claim 1 have the same_claim_scope

following dr._jangs troubles in drafting a proper_hypothetical_claim that encompassed the express_stent yet was also patentable in the face of seemingly crowded prior_art a venture that began with generating approximately ten different hypothetical_claims the district_court was under no obligation to undertake a hypothetical_claim_analysis on his behalf
a patentee like dr._jang bears the burden of proving that it is entitled to` the range of equivalents which it seeks'
wilson_sporting_goods 904 f.2d at 685
and when utilizing the hypothetical_claim tool that burden starts with proposing a proper_hypothetical_claim that only broadens the issued asserted claims
see streamfeeder 175 f.3d at 983
dr._jang can not effectively transfer the responsibility of defining the range of equivalents to which he is entitled to the district_court.7 see ultra-tex surfaces 204 f.3d at 1364` under a hypothetical_claim_analysis a patentee proposes a hypothetical_claim..' emphasis added
because as a threshold_matter dr._jang failed to submit a proper_hypothetical_claim for consideration he was unable to meet his burden of proving that his doctrine of equivalents_theory did not ensnare the prior_art
the district_court thus correctly vacated the jury_verdict of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents

failing on the merits dr._jang turns to several purported procedural infirmities in the district_courts handling of bscs ensnarement_defense
dr._jang specifically argues that bsc waived its ensnarement_defense because 1 bsc failed to raise the defense in a motion for either summary_judgment or jmol ; 2 the defense was a proxy for invalidity_defenses that were excluded by the district_court earlier in the case ; 3 bscs belated notice to dr._jang of the defense was prejudicial because it deprived him of any pre-trial discovery related to the defense ; and 4 the defense was never listed in the pretrial_order as required by ninth_circuit_law
we address each of these unpersuasive arguments in turn

first dr._jang argues that in depuy we held that ensnarement must be raised in a motion for either summary_judgment or jmol
see appellant_br.at 30 citing depuy 567 f.3d at 1324
but that is an unduly narrow reading of depuy
we considered in that case whether ensnarement is a factual question that must be tried to the jury
567 f.3d at 1323
to answer that question we turned to precedent which has treated ensnarement and prosecution_history_estoppel on equal footing
see id
(` we have called ensnarement *1288 and prosecution_history_estoppel collectivelytwo policy oriented limitations on the doctrine of equivalents both of which areapplied as questions of law

1985 overruled in part on other_grounds nobelpharma ab v. implant innovations inc. 141_f.3d_1059 1068 fed
cir

because prosecution_history_estoppel was a legal_question for a district_court to consider we concluded that ensnarement was one as well
see id
(` we see no reason why ensnarement should be treated differently for procedural purposes than prosecution_history_estoppel`
we held that
[ e ] nsnarement like prosecution_history_estoppel is` to be determined by the court either on a pretrial_motion for partial summary_judgment or on a motion for judgment as a matter of law at the close of the evidence and after the jury_verdict'
as a practical matter both legal limitations may be readily addressed in the same set of motions
id.at 1324 quoting warner-jenkinson co. v. hilton davis chem co. 520_u.s._17 39 n.8 117_s.ct._1040 137_l.ed.2d_146_(1997)
our` holding' in depuy was not that these two motions were the only vehicles by which to raise ensnarement
instead when read in context depuy is most fairly understood as holding that ensnarement is a legal_question for the district_court to decide and that the district_court could but did not have to decide that question through particular types of motions
see id
this is especially so because the district_court in depuy conducted a separate ensnarement proceeding after a jury_verdict of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents just as the district_court did here
see id.at 1321-22
we see nothing legally unsound in bsc raising ensnarement through its pretrial_motion in limine and the district_court conducting a post-trial hearing on the defense contingent on an infringement verdict under the doctrine of equivalents
moreover based on a review of the record we are satisfied that dr._jang received sufficient notice of bscs ensnarement argument

second dr._jang argues that the district_court should have barred bsc from presenting its ensnarement_defense as a matter of law because bsc was not allowed to challenge the validity of the asserted claims
allowing bsc to repackage previously-excluded invalidity_defenses in the guise of an ensnarement_defense he argues is a` camouflaged or back-handed attack' on the validity of the asserted claims and effectively an end run around the right to a jury_trial on validity
see appellant_br.at 47 50 quoting thomas & betts corp. v. litton sys. inc. 720_f.2d_1572 1580 fed
cir
1983

we are unpersuaded by dr._jangs attempt to conflate two different concepts
we have explained before that` [ t ] he ensnarement_inquiry.. has no bearing on the validity of the actual claims' asserted in a case
depuy 567 f.3d at 1323 citing wilson_sporting_goods 904 f.2d at 685
and that is because ensnarement concerns patentability with respect to a hypothetical patent claim as opposed to the validity of an actual patent claim
see wilson_sporting_goods 904 f.2d at 685` leaving this burden [ of proving that the range of equivalents sought does not ensnare the prior_art ] on [ the patentee ] does not of course in any way undermine the presumed validity of [ its ] actual patent claims
in the present situation [ the patentees ] claims will remain valid whether or not [ it ] persuades us that it is entitled to the range of equivalents sought here`
thus the fact that bsc could not pursue a validity challenge of the asserted claims in this litigation does not somehow mandate that it is likewise *1289 barred from challenging a necessarily-broader set of newly-minted hypothetical_claims

dr._jangs reliance on thomas & betts is misplaced
there we stated that` [ w ] here [ the ] validity [ of a patent ] in view of the prior_art has not been challenged the [ district ] court is less free to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents than where invalidity is specifically urged..' 720 f.2d at 1580
that observation about the relative application of the doctrine of equivalents in two different factual scenarios however is not a license for a patentee to obtain a range of equivalents that ensnares the prior_art even if an alleged infringer does not challenge the validity of the underlying patent claims
see wilson_sporting_goods 904 f.2d at 684

third dr._jang was not prejudiced by any lack of pretrial_discovery as to ensnarement
the district_court ruled that dr._jang could proceed with a doctrine of equivalents_theory at trial only shortly before it started
see j.a.at 68-69
it also alerted the parties during this time frame that it would conduct an ensnarement_hearing if the jury returned a verdict of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
id.at 12207 post-verdict minute order` after directing the [ c ] lerk to enter the jurys verdict into the record the [ district_court ] reminded counsel for both parties of its prior ruling that in the event the jury found in favor of [ p ] laintiff under the doctrine of equivalents_theory it would proceed with an evidentiary_hearing on the issue of ensnarement'
( emphasis added
by then there was little to no time to reopen discovery let alone a motion by dr._jang to do so which could have resulted in a waste of the partys resources and disrupted the district_courts case management had the jury not returned a verdict of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
in between the jurys verdict and the ensnarement_hearing the parties had` three weeks to develop evidence expert opinion and argument.. [ on the ensnarement ] defense'
appellant_br.at 34
each party was presumably on a level playing field when they arrived at the hearing
if dr._jang deemed otherwise he could have moved the district_court for an enlargement of time to conduct additional discovery on the defense

fourth and finally dr._jang argues that` ninth_circuit_law is clear that any defense not listed in the [ p ] retrial [ o ] rder is waived' and that because ensnarement was not listed in the pretrial_order the defense was waived
appellant_br.at 31-32 citing pierce cty

& rest

v. elks lodge 827_f.2d_1324 1329 9th_cir
1987 ; united states v. first nat l bank of circle 652_f.2d_882 886 9th_cir
1981
but this puts the cart before the horse
dr._jang has not adequately articulated why proper preservation of ensnarement required its explicit mention in the pretrial_order
the pretrial_order governs trial see e.g. fed
r. civ
p. 16 e but ensnarement is a legal_question for the district_court to decide and the district_court here notified the parties before trial that it would resolve that question if necessary outside of the trial see j.a.at 12207
we see no reason why the district_court should have mentioned ensnarement or the contingent post-trial hearing on ensnarement in the pretrial_order under these circumstances

in sum the district_court permissibly conducted a post-trial ensnarement_hearing after finding that bsc timely raised the defense and it appropriately vacated the jury_verdict of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents and entered judgment of non-infringement for bsc when dr._jang failed to demonstrate through a proper hypothetical_claim_analysis that his *1290 doctrine of equivalents_theory did not ensnare the prior_art

c. cross-appeal
bsc cross-appeals the denial of its motion for summary_judgment in which the district_court held that it owed royalties to dr._jang if the express_stent were covered by the asserted claims notwithstanding the ptos eventual_cancellation of those claims
we dismiss the cross-appeal because it does not seek to enlarge the district_courts judgment of non-infringement in its favor
instead the cross-appeal merely offers an alternative basis to affirm the judgment
see howmedica osteonics corp. v. wright med
tech. inc. 540_f.3d_1337 1343 n.2 fed
cir
2008 dismissing` cross-appeal as improper because it did not seek to enlarge the judgment but merely asserted an alternative ground to affirm the judgment' ; see also symantec corp. v. computer assocs
int l inc. 522_f.3d_1279 1294-95 fed
cir
2008
when an improper cross-appeal is dismissed we may nonetheless consider the arguments raised as alternative grounds for sustaining the judgment
symantec 522 f.3d at 1294
because we affirm the district_courts judgment on other_grounds we need not do so here

conclusion
based on the foregoing analyses the district_court correctly denied dr._jangs motion for jmol of literal_infringement of claims 1_and_8 of the021_patent as substantial_evidence supported the jurys verdict of no literal_infringement
the district_court properly vacated the jurys finding of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents because it correctly concluded that dr._jang did not meet his burden of proving that his doctrine of equivalents_theory did not ensnare the prior_art as he failed to draft a proper_hypothetical_claim
the district_court consequently entered judgment of non-infringement in favor of bsc and we affirm that entry of judgment
we dismiss the cross-appeal and need not reach the arguments it raised

affirmed

because we affirm the district_courts non-infringement determination and therefore need not address bscs cross appeal the ptos cancellation of claims 1_and_8 has no bearing in our decision
2
we are mindful that this is not a typical patent case where for example the plaintiff patentee is asserting a patent against a defendant accused infringer
for convenience however we will use` infringe' and the like when discussing whether the express_stent is covered by the021_patent
3
despite the fact that the asserted claims do not use the term` peak-to-peak' the parties agree that this is an inherent limitation of the asserted claims
4
the hypothetical_claim_analysis is not the only method in which a district_court can assess whether a doctrine of equivalents_theory ensnares the prior_art
see conroy v. reebok int l ltd. 14_f.3d_1570 1576-77 fed

1994 ; int l visual corp. v. crown metal mfg co. 991_f.2d_768 772 fed
cir

we note that dr._jang never asked the district_court to assess the scope of his doctrine of equivalents_theory using a method other than the hypothetical_claim_analysis
5
we have described the ensnarement_inquiry as one of determining the patentability of the hypothetical_claim rather than its validity
that is because` [ t ] he pertinent question' is` whether that hypothetical_claim could have been allowed by the pto over the prior_art' as the pto has never actually issued it
wilson_sporting_goods 904 f.2d at 684

we will not recite the other limitations of claim 1 that remain unchanged in dr._jangs hypothetical_claims three and five
7
in streamfeeder after we rejected the patentees hypothetical_claim for impermissibly narrowing the patent claim in one respect while also broadening it in another we additionally explained why a proper_hypothetical_claim in that case-one without the narrowing limitation-was unpatentable over the prior_art
see 175 f.3d at 983-84
nothing in streamfeeder however requires courts to engage in this additional inquiry when the patentee fails to come forward with a proper_hypothetical_claim
