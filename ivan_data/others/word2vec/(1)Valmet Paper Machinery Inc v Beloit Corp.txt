background
the patents in suit relate to the final drying portion of paper-making machinery
in *1410 the paper-making process a system of large machines sprays a suspension of fiber and water onto a moving web
the machines then maneuver the wet web through a series of steps to remove the water beginning with the formation stage where water drains from the web by operation of gravity
the second stage generally involves pressing additional water from the web with rollers
the last stage the area of the inventions in this appeal features heated drying cylinders designed to evaporate the remaining moisture as the web comes in contact with them

the heated-cylinder segment of the drying process presents several challenges
the paper_web moves through the drying machines at high speed and these machines must avoid stretching or tearing the web
at the same_time the machines must dry the paper as evenly as possible including both the top and bottom surfaces of the web
conventionally this stage has employed heated_cylinders in a` two tier' setup
in a two-tier arrangement one row of cylinders lies in an upper plane and a second_row of cylinders lies in a lower plane
looking along the length of a two-tier drying section the sequence of cylinders applied alternates between the upper and lower planes such that the next_cylinder in order is on the opposite plane
the paper_web runs beneath a lower-plane_cylinder then over an upper-plane_cylinder then under a lower-plane_cylinder and so on
the lower cylinders apply heat to the top surface of the paper and the upper cylinders to the bottom surface
this figure depicts a prior_art two-tier dryer.1

problems arise from` open draws' where the paper_web must cross unsupported through an open space to the next_cylinder
as the web speeds from under a bottom cylinder up to make contact with the next upper cylinder for example the portion of the web not in contact with a cylinder tends to` flutter'
this increases the risk of stretching or breakage
two-tier drying machines have employed felt guide_belts which accompany the web through the machine then circle back to the beginning of the machine to create a continuous loop as well as guide rollers to reduce the risk of damage to the web
a felt guide_belt traveling with the web however prevents the heated_cylinders from directly touching the web on the side adjacent to the felt

the first of the patents in suit the soininen_patent no._3868,780 issued march_4,_1975 to valmet as assignee
the soininen_patent claims` drying cylinder_group [ s ]' comprising` two substantially parallel rows of drying cylinders' where a guide_belt and guide_rolls direct the web along each cylinder in the first row before bringing the web to the start of the second_row rather than alternating around cylinders in two separate *1411 rows in different_planes
after the first_group additional guide_rolls cause the guide_belt to run along the opposite sides of the next group of drying cylinders
as a result drying cylinder_groups apply direct heat to one side of the web in its first_group and the other_side in its second group
soininen also discusses inclusion of` foraminous' i.e. perforated guide_rolls and claims a structure where walls enclose the sides of the guide_belt loops
forming a closed space inside the belt facilitates introduction of a vacuum in that space to pull the paper_web outside the guide_belt more tightly onto the belt and rolls
the following figure comes from the soininen_patent.2

in 1981 a german patent application citing soininen elaborated on the vacuum aspect of the soininen invention
this hauser_application taught that it is more efficient to place individual suction devices within each of soininens perforated guide_rolls instead of using large walls to close off the entire_space inside a guide_belt
hauser also emphasized benefits from moving the` suction guide_rolls' closer to the heated drying cylinders to keep the web in contact with rolls or cylinders as much as possible
although no patent issued the hauser_application was published february 17 1983
beloit submitted only the german-language version of the hauser_publication to the patent_examiner during prosecution of the two beloit_patents discussed below

more recently beloit obtained patents on features of its` bel-champ' drying machine including patents no._5144,758758_patent issued september 8 1992 from an application filed november 14 1991 and no._5249,372372_patent issued october 5 1993 from an application filed april_9,_1992
basically beloits patents claim a` single_tier drying section' comprising` a first_plurality of drying cylinders' with its own` dryer felt' and` vacuum_rolls.. in close_proximity' to their adjacent drying cylinders for drying one side of the paper_web followed by a second mirror-image section for drying the other_side of the web
beloit argues that 1 the single-tier design 2 the use of vacuum_rolls and 3 the close_proximity of the vacuum_rolls to the drying cylinders distinguish its invention from prior_art dryer designs including soininen and hauser

valmet sued beloit in the united_states_district_court for the western_district of wisconsin alleging infringement of the soininen_patent and to invalidate beloits758 and372_patent s due to either anticipation or obviousness
beloit counterclaimed for infringement
the district_court granted summary_judgment that beloit had not infringed the soininen_patent and that soininen did not anticipate beloits patents
a four-part trial followed
dealing first with validity a jury found claims 1_and_2 of the372_patent and claims 1-3 of the758_patent not obvious but found claim 3 of the758_patent and claims 1_and_2 of the372_patent indefinite and therefore invalid
as a result only claims 1_and_2 of the758_patent remained
the jury then found that valmet infringed those two claims literally and unnecessarily under the doctrine of equivalents
in part three the court ruled beloit not guilty of inequitable_conduct by failing to submit an english translation of hauser to the patent_examiner
last the jury found valmets infringement not willful and awarded beloit lost profits from valmets sale of an infringing drying machine in new mexico

after the verdict the district_court denied valmets motion for judgment as a matter of law` jmol' seeking to invalidate the first two claims of the758_patent
instead the court granted beloits jmol_motion and overruled the jurys findings of indefiniteness
the district_court then awarded damages to beloit and granted an injunction barring future infringement by valmet of either the758 or the372_patent

analysis
valmet appeals the judgment that claims 1_and_2 of of the372_patent and claims 1-3 of the758_patent are not invalid and are infringed
valmet contends the court erred by refusing to invalidate the beloit_patents on grounds of anticipation or obviousness or to declare them unenforceable because of inequitable_conduct
valmet further argues that the district_court miscalculated the damages awarded to beloit and improperly granted an injunction barring valmet from infringing either patent in the future

we turn to the conclusion that the subject matter of beloits patents met the statutory requirement of nonobviousness of 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 despite the teachings of the soininen_patent and the hauser_publication
the test for nonobviousness begins with a factual_inquiry and ends with a legal conclusion based on the resultant factual foundation
panduit corp. v. dennison mfg co. 810_f.2d_1561 1566-68 1_uspq2d_1593 1595-97 fed.cir.1987
on appeal we apply the clearly erroneous standard to the courts factfinding and we review the legal conclusion de novo
id

with regard to the factual_inquiry no doubt exists that the soininen_patent and hauser_publication constitute prior_art and both beloit_patents cite the two documents as prior_art references
the parties vigorously contest the district_courts findings and conclusions concerning the second component
the court performed this part of the inquiry when it answered the obviousness question in denying valmets jmol_motion
the court 1 construed the claims of the soininen_patent and identified its teachings 2 construed the asserted claims of beloits758 and372_patent s 3 found substantial differences between beloits claimed inventions and the prior_art and 4 ruled that beloits patents would not *1413 have been obvious in view of those differences

courts must construe disputed claim terms as a matter of law based on the claims the specification and the prosecution history
markman v. westview instruments inc. 52_f.3d_967 986 fed.cir.1995 in banc affd 517_u.s._370 116_s.ct._1384 134_l.ed.2d_577_(1996)
in reaching its decision the district_court focused on two aspects of the parties competing drying sections
first the district_court examined valmets` drying cylinder_group' with` two substantially parallel rows of drying cylinders' and compared it to beloits` single_tier drying section' with two consecutive` pluralit [ ies ] of drying cylinders'
the court found that soininen taught a` stacked arrangement' of the two rows of cylinders while beloits patents claimed a` single horizontally disposed plane of dryer cylinders' emphasis in original
essentially the court read soininen to teach only a sideways u-shaped i.e. arrangement
meanwhile the court construed beloits asserted claims to refer to a machine that dries one side in the first_plurality then moves the web forward in a single_plane into a second plurality to dry the other_side
the court concluded that` single_tier' means single_plane and that unfolding soininens two rows into a single_plane would not have been obvious

although the figures in valmets soininen_patent depict various stacked arrangements nothing in the patent requires a stacked arrangement of the two rows of drying cylinders
on the contrary the phrase` substantially parallel' explicitly encompasses parallel configurations in one plane or in two different_planes
at the same_time nothing in beloits758 or372_patent s requires an arrangement of the two pluralities of drying cylinders horizontally disposed in a single_plane
furthermore beloits specifications and prosecution histories make it clear that the phrase` single_tier' primarily serves to distinguish prior_art` two tier' sections where the web traveled alternately around cylinders in two different tiers on two different_planes
thus we hold that the district_court incorrectly limited the teachings of soininen misconstrued beloits patents and erroneously overstated the differences between the two inventions

in the second phase of its comparison the district_court focused on valmets assertion that its soininen_patent in combination with the hauser_publication taught the use of vacuum or suction rolls that render the corresponding aspect of beloits invention obvious
the district_court dismissed this argument largely based on hausers failure to obtain a patent on his invention and the court noted the patent_examiners conclusion that hauser had failed to invent anything new
whether or not it describes a patentable invention however the hauser_publication undeniably teaches the use of suction boxes to create vacuum guide_rolls
see e.g. constant v. advanced micro-devices inc. 848_f.2d_1560 1572 7_uspq2d_1057 1065 fed.cir.1988 references for obviousness not limited to issued patents
beloit seeks to avoid the import of this by limiting its focus to figure 6 of soininen the one figure which may depict non-foraminous_guide_rolls
we see no reason to limit our analysis to figure 6
the whole of the soininen_patent teaches the use of foraminous_guide_rolls to facilitate suction through the surface of the guide_rolls
hauser then teaches the placement of individual suction boxes inside the foraminous_guide_rolls rather than the use of walls closing off the entire_space inside the guide_belt to create the vacuum
hauser also states that it is known in the art to place the guide_rolls close to the drying cylinders
the district_court committed clear error by disregarding these teachings of hauser

given our reading of the soininen_patent and hauser_publication and our interpretation of the beloit_patents we hold that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have found beloits asserted claimed inventions obvious
such a person would find it obvious to unfold valmets drying cylinder_group into a straight line
similarly such a person would learn from soininen the benefit of foraminous_guide_rolls with a vacuum and from hauser the advantage of individual vacuum sources inside the guide_rolls
accordingly we hold *1414 claims 1_and_2 of the372_patent and claims 1-3 of the758_patent invalid under section 103
we further reverse the award of damages and vacate the injunction against valmet
