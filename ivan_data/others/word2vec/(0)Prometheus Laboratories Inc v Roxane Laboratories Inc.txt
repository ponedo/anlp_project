prometheus_laboratories inc.` prometheus' appeals a judgment of the u.s. district court for the district of new_jersey holding the amended claims of u.s. patent no._6284,770` the ¡¬770_patent` invalid
the district_court found the claims would have been obvious over the prior_art or in the alternative invalid on grounds of obviousness-type_double_patenting over u.s. patent no._5360,800` the ¡¬800_patent`
we affirm the district_courts decision because the claims of the ¡¬770_patent are invalid as obvious over the ¡¬800_patent and other_prior_art and do not reach the issue of double_patenting

background
irritable bowel syndrome` ibs' is a condition defined and diagnosed by its constellation of symptoms
patients may suffer from diarrhea-predominant_ibs` ibs-d' constipation-predominant_ibs` ibs-c' or less often mixed ibs` ibs-m' or alternating ibs` ibs-a'
a patients symptoms define the type of ibs with which a patient is diagnosed

in this case prometheus the owner of the ¡¬770_patent sued roxane_laboratories inc.` roxane' and cipla ltd.` cipla' together` defendants' alleging infringement of claims 5 6 10 13 and 14 of the ¡¬ 770 patent
as described below the ¡¬770_patent claims a method of treatment for ibs-d utilizing alosetron known by the *1095 brand name lotronex
the question is whether these claims of the ¡¬770_patent would have been obvious over various prior_art references or are invalid for obviousness-type_double_patenting over the prior ¡¬800_patent

prometheus also owns the ¡¬800_patent which also covers the use of alosetron for treatment of ibs
the ¡¬800_patent issued on november 1 1994 and has now expired.1 the ¡¬800_patent is prior_art to the ¡¬770_patent asserted here
claim 17 of the ¡¬800_patent is directed to` [ a ] method of treating a condition [ such as ibs ] which is ameliorated by antagonism of 5-ht3 receptors which comprises administering to a patient an effective_amount of [ alosetron ]'
¡¬800_patent col. 38_ll._7 -12
claim 27 of the ¡¬ 800 patent covers` [ a ] method according to claim 17 for the treatment of irritable_bowel_syndrome'
id.at col. 38_ll._50 -51

the ¡¬770_patent entitled` medicaments for the treatment of non-constipated female irritable bowel syndrome' is also directed to a method of treating ibs_patients using alosetron
the ¡¬770_patent has a priority_date of october 7 1997
after the ¡¬770_patent issued prometheus initiated an ex parte reexamination of the ¡¬770_patent and a reexamination certificate was issued on october 19 2010
during reexamination prometheus amended claim 5 to add new claim limitations those new limitations are underlined below and added inter_alia claims 10_and_13

reexamined claims 5 10 and 13 provide 5
a method for treating a diarrhea-predominant_female_ibs_patient while excluding those with predominant_constipation said method_comprising assessing whether said diarrhea-predominant_female_ibs_patient has experienced symptoms for at least six months ; and
administering an effective_amount of alosetron or a pharmaceutically acceptable_derivative thereof to said patient who has experienced symptoms for at least six months wherein said effective_amount is dependent on the condition of the patient and is at the discretion of the attendant_physician
10
the method for treating according to claim 5 further comprising assessing whether said female ibs patient has experienced at least_moderate_pain prior to administration of alosetron
13
a method for treating a diarrhea-predominant_female_ibs_patient while excluding those with predominant_constipation said method_comprising assessing whether said diarrhea-predominant_female_ibs_patient has experienced symptoms for at least six months ; assessing whether said nonconstipated female ibs patient experiences at least_moderate_baseline_pain from ibs ; and
administering an effective_amount of alosetron or a pharmaceutically acceptable_derivative thereof to said patient who has experienced symptoms for at least six months and who experiences at least_moderate_baseline_pain from ibs wherein said effective_amount is dependent on the condition of the patient and is at the discretion of the attendant_physician
ex parte reexamination certificate ¡¬770_patent
claims 6_and_14 which depend from claims 5_and_13 respectively limit alosetron to its hydrochloride salt form

*1096 some background information on the history of lotronex is helpful to understanding the issues here
shortly before the issuance of the ¡¬770_patent lotronex was approved by the fda as a treatment for ibs and was launched in 2000
that same year the drug had to be taken off the market because of serious_side_effects including death
the drug was re-launched in 2002 with a new more restrictive_label new warnings about side_effects and a risk management program
after reintroduction the label specified that lotronex is indicated only for women with severe_ibs-d who have inter_alia chronic_symptoms generally lasting six months or longer and should not be used on patients with constipation-indications that correspond to the limitations of the amended ¡¬770_patent claims
the label also included so-called` black_box' warnings regarding the potential for serious_side_effects and repeated that lotronex should only be prescribed to women with severe diarrhea-predominant_ibs who have not responded adequately to conventional_therapy

following reintroduction the number of severe_incidents associated with lotronex dropped but the rate of adverse events did not change
the district_court found that` [ l ] imiting the patient_population to women with severe_ibs-d did not change the risk profile for lotronex
even when limited to that cohort of the patient_population lotronexs incidence of complications did not decrease'
j.a
12
the district_court also found that the decrease in the number of severe_incidents is less likely due to the more restrictive_label and more likely attributable to other changes in how lotronex is prescribed
for example lotronex can only be prescribed pursuant to a rems risk evaluation and mitigation strategies which requires patients and doctors to complete a form that highlights the risks ; lotronexs label now has` black_box' warnings about the drugs potential side_effects and instructs doctors that it should only be prescribed to patients with severe_ibs-d who have not responded to conventional_therapy ; and its prior removal from the market caused doctors to be more vigilant with respect to complications
these cautionary steps are not claimed in the ¡¬770_patent

in 2009 roxane filed an abbreviated new drug application` anda' with the food and drug administration` fda' seeking approval to commercially market a generic version of lotronex prior to the expiration of the ¡¬770_patent
in 2010 following the relisting in the orange book of the ¡¬770_patent after its reexamination roxane submitted to the fda a paragraph iv certification that the patent was non-infringed or invalid

in 2011 prometheus filed suit against defendants alleging infringement of reexamined claims 5 6 10 13 and 14 of the ¡¬770_patent based on the filing of the anda an artificial act of infringement
see 35 u.s.c.¡± 271 e 2

after a bench_trial the district_court held that the asserted claims of the ¡¬ 770 patent would have been obvious when considering the prior_art and secondary_considerations of nonobviousness
the district_court found that` the elements of the ¡¬770_patent were present in the prior_art and the differences between the prior_art and the claims of the ¡¬770_patent are insubstantial.. [ as ] some of the prior_art is *1097 virtually identical to the claimed inventions'
j.a
44
the district_court also found that the asserted claims of the ¡¬770_patent would have been obvious in light of secondary_considerations
the district_court found that it was not unexpected for alosetron to exhibit greater_efficacy in ibs-d_patients who have exhibited symptoms for greater than six months and who have experienced at least_moderate_pain
the district_court held that the limited_evidence at trial did not establish that there is an unexpected_result of greater_efficacy in women
the district_court concluded that` [ a ] t best the claims at issue are a combination of known elements combined in a known way to produce expected results'
j.a
47
as noted above the district_court found that the clinical improvement of reintroduced lotronex was due to factors other than the ¡¬ 770 patent
moreover the district_court found that any commercial_success of reintroduced lotronex could not be attributed to the method claimed in the ¡¬770_patent but rather was due to prometheus marketing and sales practices
finally the district_court found that the method claimed in the ¡¬ 770 patent did not satisfy a long-felt but unmet_need
thus` [ a ] fter considering the knowledge of one of ordinary_skill in the art the scope and content of the prior_art compared to the claimed invention and the objective considerations of nonobviousness' the district_court held that` the claims of ¡¬770_patent considered as a whole are obvious'
j.a
44
in the alternative the district_court held that the claims were invalid for obviousness-type_double_patenting in light of the claims of the ¡¬800_patent2 given its invalidity rulings the district_court did not reach the issue of infringement

discussion
we conclude that the asserted claims of the ¡¬770_patent are invalid as obvious under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103
a patent would have been obvious` if the differences between the claimed invention and the prior_art are such that the claimed invention as a whole would have been obvious before the effective filing date of the claimed invention to a person having ordinary_skill in the art to which the claimed invention pertains'
id
obviousness is based on underlying factual_findings including 1 the level of ordinary_skill in the art ; 2 the scope and content of the prior_art ; 3 the differences between the claims and the prior_art ; and 4 secondary_considerations of nonobviousness such as commercial_success long-felt but unmet_needs failure of others and unexpected_results
see ksr int l co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 406 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007) ; *1098 graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 17-18 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966)

the primary prior_art reference relied on by the district_court was the ¡¬800_patent
in addition to the ¡¬800_patent the district_court relied on a number of research publications that predated the october 7 1997 priority_date of the ¡¬770_patent as prior_art references

the district_court determined and the parties agreed that the relevant person of ordinary_skill in the art is a gastroenterologist with three years of experience
the district_court also found and prometheus and defendants agreed that the claims of the ¡¬770_patent recite a species of the genus method claimed in the ¡¬800 prior_art_patent
the ¡¬800_patent claims the use of alosetron to treat patients suffering from ibs
the ¡¬770_patent claims treating a subset of those ibs_patients-those who 1 are women 2 with ibs-d 3 who have experienced symptoms for at least six months and 4 who have had moderate pain
while the parties dispute whether the claims of the ¡¬770_patent operate as exclusions defining patient categories that should not be treated with alosetron we need not decide this question
even treating the limitations of the ¡¬770 claims as exclusions we conclude that before october 7 1997 it would have been obvious to a person of ordinary_skill to treat those sub-species claimed here

to be sure` [ i ] t is well-settled that a narrow species can be non-obvious and patent eligible despite a patent on its genus'
abbvie 764 f.3d at 1379
an` earlier disclosure of a genus does not necessarily prevent patenting a species member of the genus'
eli lilly & co. v. bd
of regents of univ
of wash. 334_f.3d_1264 1270 fed.cir.2003

the genus-species distinction may have particular relevance in the field of personalized medicine where for example a particular treatment may be effective with respect to one subset of patients and ineffective and even harmful to another subset of patients
see e.g. margaret a. hamburg & francis s. collins the path to personalized medicine 363 new eng
j. med
301 301 2010
singling out a particular subset of patients for treatment for example patients with a particular gene may reflect a new and useful invention that is patent eligible despite the existence of prior_art or a prior_art_patent disclosing the treatment_method to patients generally
an obviousness rejection likely would not be appropriate where the new patient subset displayed unexpected_results

but that is not the situation here
in this case the district_courts factual_findings make clear that at the time of the ¡¬770_patent it would have been obvious for a person skilled in the art to have separately treated the limited subset claimed in the ¡¬770_patent with alosetron and that any unexpected_results were attributable to factors exogenous to the ¡¬770_patent

the first limitation of asserted claim 5 of the ¡¬770_patent pertains to treating women
prometheus argues that the district_court erred in framing its inquiry as whether alosetron was administered to women with ibs-d in the prior_art rather than as whether it was obvious to focus on treating women rather than men
it is not disputed that it was well known in 1997 that a majority of ibs_patients were women
as the district_court found it was well known that` approximately 75 % to 80 % of ibs-d_patients.. have always been [ ] women
`` 3_j.a._9
for example the 1992 *1099 thompson article reported that female ibs_patients predominate in western countries
even if the claims should be read as focusing treatment on women as prometheus urges the district_court found the prior_art taught precisely that
the hysu study 1995 taught that females taking alosetron` had higher concentrations of alosetron in their blood and total amount of the drug absorbed compared to [ males taking alosetron ]' and the district_court found that` [ t ] his could reasonably suggest that women would have a greater response to the drug than men'
j.a
25
at the time of the ¡¬770_patents priority_date it would have been obvious to a person having ordinary_skill in the art to treat women as a separate_group of ibs_patients

the next claim limitation in asserted claim 5 of the ¡¬770_patent pertains to only treating patients suffering from ibs-d
the district_court concluded that several pre-1997 publications taught that` alosetron and other 5-ht3_antagonists slow colonic transit' and` taught that alosetron would be beneficial to prescribe to those with ibs-d and potentially harmful to those with ibs-c.' j.a
30
for instance the district_court found that the talley_study 1992` taught that 5-ht3_antagonists slowed colonic transit and would be helpful in treating ibs-d and harmful in treating ibs-c.' j.a
30
the district_court found that the sanger study 1996 taught that` 5-ht3_antagonists have the potential to treat diarrhea and recommends that they only be used with severe patients because of the potential to cause constipation'
j.a
22

prometheus basic objection is that the district_court simply relied on studies suggesting that the class of 5-ht3 antagonist drugs of which alosetron is a part should be used to treat ibs-d and not ibs-c
while those studies were not focused on alosetron but the class of drugs there is ample testimony that a person of ordinary_skill would have understood the studies as equally applicable to alosetron
see e.g. j.a
1747-51 1760
we do not think the district_court clearly erred in concluding that the lessons drawn with regard to a class of drugs 5-ht3_antagonists are applicable to a species alosetron within that class

prometheus submits that the district_court relied on references in which alosetron was administered to healthy volunteers instead of ibs_patients and that studies that did test alosetron in ibs_patients suggested only that alosetron would be helpful in treating ibs generally
but the district_court did not extrapolate those study results on its own ; rather this conclusion was informed by expert_testimony
e.g. j.a
1763
and the studies cited by prometheus specifically state that alosetron delays colonic transfer
j.a
866 868
we see no clear_error in the district_courts conclusion that it would have been obvious to a person of ordinary_skill in the art reading the claims of the ¡¬800_patent and the prior_art to limit treatment to patients suffering from ibs-d

as to the claim limitation requiring symptoms for` at least six months' before administering alosetron j.a
71 it was common practice at the time of the ¡¬800_patent to determine whether a patient had suffered symptoms for longer than six months
dr. lucak prometheus own_expert testified that the benefit of the six-month limitation was having` a greater confidence in the diagnosis'
j.a
1372
pre-october 1997 studies suggest using a six-month_standard for the diagnosis of ibs
the so-called manning criteria named after a 1978 study call for symptoms lasting at least 6 months
the kruis_study 1984` specifically teaches using the existence of symptoms for over two years as a basis for increasing the confidence in *1100 a diagnosis of ibs'
j.a
20
the francis paper february 1997` discloses the use of a 6-month duration criterion to reduce the margin of error' in diagnosing ibs
j.a
21
in fact the district_court found that` most ibs-d_patients will have symptoms for more than 6 months' and` it has always been true that waiting a longer period of time to observe a patients symptoms decreases the likelihood of a false positive'
j.a
9
in 1997 it would have been obvious for a person having skill in the art to treat patients displaying ibs symptoms for more than six months as a separate_group
although prometheus argues that three months was the diagnostic standard in 1997 the district_courts finding as to the six-month_standard is amply supported by the record and is not clearly erroneous

regarding the limitation directed to at least_moderate_pain at the time the ¡¬ 800 patent issued it was well-known to evaluate patients for pain in order to diagnose ibs
the rome criteria4 for diagnosing ibs are standard criteria used to diagnose ibs and inquire into pain and its severity
pain is in fact a main symptom of ibs along with diarrhea and constipation
the manning_study 1978 states that` [ a ] bdominal pain constipation and diarrhoea are the main symptoms [ of ibs ]'
j.a
822
the kruis_study 1984 defines ibs as` a cluster of chronic_symptoms that include abdominal_pain'
j.a
815
the steadman study 1992 states that` [ c ] linically patients with ibs experience fluctuations in bowel habit abdominal_pain and other symptoms'
j.a
839
and the talley_study 1992 states that` [ p ] atients with irritable_bowel_syndrome typically have a chronic but erratic disturbance of defecation and associated abdominal_pain'
j.a
855
in the manning_study all but one of the thirty-two patients diagnosed with ibs had pain
in the kruis_study 96 % of patients diagnosed with ibs had abdominal_pain

prometheus concedes that doctors commonly assess ibs_patients for pain and does not dispute that it would have been obvious to use alosetron to treat pain
instead prometheus argues that it would not have been obvious to administer alosetron only to patients suffering from at least_moderate_pain
but as the district_court noted prometheus own_expert dr. lembo testified that because a candidate for lotronex was a patient with severe_ibs` its pretty obvious that [ a physician ] will assess for at least_moderate_pain'
j.a
1303
the expert_testimony also shows that a person of ordinary_skill would have adopted a conservative approach in treating ibs_patients and avoided drug intervention for a patient with mild symptoms
the district_court did not err in finding that it would have been obvious for a person having skill in the art to single out ibs_patients displaying at least_moderate_pain

relevant here is our decision in abbvie
there a prior_art genus patent claimed a method of co-administering two drugs to treat rheumatoid arthritis
abbvie 764 f.3d.at 1378-79
the later patent contained a species claim limiting the prior_art genus to a more specific patient group individuals with` active disease'
abbvie 764 f.3d at 1378-79
borrowing from` the law of obviousness generally' we noted that` if the later expiring patent is merely an obvious variation of an invention disclosed and claimed in the reference patent the later expiring patent is invalid'
id.at 1378-79 quotation_marks and citation *1101 omitted
this case is analogous
here it would have been obvious for a person having ordinary_skill in the art reading the ¡¬800_patent to treat female patients with ibs-d who had symptoms for at least six months and who had experienced at least_moderate_pain
as discussed above these limitations are directed to a known type of ibs to treating the gender that predominantly experiences ibs to treating patients with a characteristic that is always or almost always evaluated in establishing ibs and to assessing symptoms for a duration of time that was common in diagnosing patients with ibs

while this case unlike abbvie involves a few different variables the district_court found that it would have been obvious to combine the teachings of the prior_art in the form of the ¡¬770_patent
the record contains abundant evidence that there was a limited number of known parameters and it would have been obvious to combine the teachings as to each parameter

finally the district_court carefully considered secondary_considerations of nonobviousness as required by our precedent in re cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsule patent litig. 676_f.3d_1063 1079 fed.cir.2012 and found that the secondary_considerations did not support a conclusion of nonobviousness
prometheus first argued that the reintroduced lotronexs commercial_success can be attributed directly to the ¡¬770_patent noting that from 2003_to_2007 net sales of lotronex increased each year and the original_patent_owner was able to sell the lotronex_franchise to prometheus for $ 120 million
the district_court recognized that sales revenue of lotronex increased from the time of its reintroduction into the market in 2002_until_2012 but observed that` by 2011 there were just over 42,000 prescriptions of lotronex written per year for about 10,000 patients
this was only about 2,100 more prescriptions compared to its peak year of sales with [ the original_patent_owner ]'
j.a
14
the district_court determined that the ¡¬770_patent was not responsible for the commercial_success of reintroduced lotronex but instead that the evidence showed` the growth in revenue [ since lotronexs reintroduction into the market ] is due to prometheuss actions in marketing increasing the price of lotronex and introducing a series of rebates to stimulate sales of the drug rather than from the treatment_method claimed in the ¡¬770_patent'
j.a
15
the district_court was not persuaded by prometheus evidence relating the commercial_success of lotronex to the ¡¬770_patent because prometheus did not submit an analysis that would show the commercial_success for the ¡¬ 770 patent on its own merits` control [ ling ] for other variables and separat [ ing ] the treatment instructions from the drug compound and the method in the ¡¬ 800 patent that already existed nor any analysis to control for other changing variables such as marketing campaigns new drug warnings pricing changes etc'
j.a
41

prometheus argues that the district_court erred by placing the burden of proof on prometheus to demonstrate the nexus between lotronexs commercial_success and the ¡¬770_patent
the party challenging the validity of a patent always has the burden of persuading the trial court of invalidity
microsoft corp. v. i4i ltd. p'ship 564_u.s._91 131_s.ct._2238 2242-43 180_l.ed.2d_131_(2011)
however` once a challenger has presented a prima_facie_case of invalidity the patentee has the burden of going forward with rebuttal evidence
but all that means is that even though a patentee never must submit evidence to support a conclusion by a judge or jury that a patent remains valid once a challenger introduces evidence that might *1102 lead to a conclusion of invalidity-what we call a prima_facie_case-the patentee would be well advised to introduce evidence sufficient to rebut that of the challenger'
pfizer inc. v. apotex inc. 480_f.3d_1348 1360 fed.cir.2007 quotation_marks and citations omitted

we do not find that the district_court improperly shifted the burden of proof as to commercial_success
although the district_court described and rejected prometheus attempts to` prove commercial_success of lotronex and that [ lotronex ] fulfilled a long-felt but unmet_need' j.a
41 we understand those statements to be in reference to prometheus burden of production
we have found that similar imperfect language is not grounds for reversal
optivus tech. inc. v. ion beam applications s.a. 469_f.3d_978 991 fed.cir.2006 citation and quotation_marks omitted affirming the district_courts holding of invalidity despite the courts statement that` [ t ] here is no indication that the [ motivation to combine ] was non-obvious' because the district_courts opinion as a whole indicated it` correctly allocated the burden of proof'
the district_court opinion clearly states the correct standard in finding the claims of the ¡¬770 obvious by clear and convincing evidence
j.a
44

prometheus next argued that the ¡¬770_patent met a long-felt but unmet_need and created an unexpected_result by improving the safety and risk-benefit profiles of alosetron
the district_court rejected these contentions
the district_court was not persuaded that any long-felt need was satisfied by the instructions claimed in the ¡¬770_patent` as distinguished from.. the drug itself which is covered by the ¡¬800_patent'
j.a
41
it found that` it is clear that many of the benefits touted by prometheus were attributable to the compound itself rather than the ¡¬770_patents method of treatment'
j.a
16
the district_court further found that` any praise or reduction in the severity of side_effects is more likely attributable to elements from the ¡¬ 800 patent the new safety precautions heightened awareness and warnings issued after lotronexs reintroduction'
j.a
44
we find no clear_error in the district_courts factual conclusions in this respect

we affirm the district_courts holding that the challenged claims of the ¡¬770_patent would have been obvious over the ¡¬800_patent and other_prior_art
