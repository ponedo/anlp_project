background patentee filed action against competitor alleging infringement of patents on apparatus and method of treating tissue_damage by applying negative or reduced_pressure to wound over area sufficient to promote migration of epithelial and subcutaneous_tissue toward wound and for time_period sufficient to facilitate closure of wound
the united states district court for the western district of texas w. royal furgeson jr. j. granted judgment as matter of law jmol of invalidity for obviousness
patentee appealed

holdings the court of appeals o'malley circuit_judge held that

district_court was required to accept all implicit_factual_findings supporting jurys conclusion with respect to ultimate_conclusion of nonobviousness that were supported by substantial_evidence ;

substantial_evidence supported finding that prior_art_references did not disclose treating wounds with negative_pressure as required by patents ;

court had to assume that jury found patentees expert to be credible and persuasive in his opinion that prior_art reference did not disclose use of negative_pressure to heal wounds as patents did ;

background
i
asserted patents
kinetic_concepts inc. kci_licensing inc. kci_usa inc. kci_medical_resources kci_manufacturing and medical_holdings_limited collectively` kci' and wake_forest brought suit against s & n alleging infringement of u.s. patent nos._7216,651` ¡¬651_patent` and 5,645,081` ¡¬081_patent`
wake_forest is the owner of the asserted patents and kci are the exclusive licensees of the patents
both patents claim methods and apparatuses for treating difficult-to-heal wounds by applying suction or negative_pressure e.g. ¡¬651_patent abstract ; ¡¬081_patent abstract
wake_forest and kci asserted that s & n infringes apparatus claims 2_and_5 of the ¡¬081_patent and induces infringement of method claims 42 109 116 and 121 of the ¡¬651_patent

as described by the asserted patents medical` treatment of open wounds that are too large to spontaneously close' is difficult
¡¬081_patent col.1 ll.11-12 ; ¡¬651_patent col.1 ll.29-30
`` wound closure requires that epithelial and subcutaneous_tissue migrate from the wound border toward the wound'
¡¬081_patent col.2 ll.49-50
to facilitate such migration doctors commonly use mechanical closures such as sutures or staples
id.at_col.l 11.24-25
such mechanical closures create tension on the skin which encourages epithelial migration
id.at_col.l 11.25-28
`` while suturing and stapling of wounds is widely practiced it has a major drawback the tensile force required to achieve closure with sutures or staples causes very high localized stresses at the suture insertion points resulting in the rupture of the tissue at these points'
id.at_col.l 11.28-33
this rupturing inhibits healing of the wound
id.at_col.l 11.33-35
additionally it is not feasible to suture some large open wounds
id.at col.1 ll.28-33

to address these shortcomings the invention applies` negative_pressure to a wound over an area sufficient to promote migration of epithelial and subcutaneous_tissue toward the wound with the negative_pressure being maintained for a time sufficient to facilitate closure of the wound'
id.at col.2 ll.45-49 ; ¡¬651_patent col.4 ll.18-23` [ a ] method of treating tissue_damage is provided which comprises applying a negative or reduced_pressure to a wound over an area sufficient to promote the migration of epithelial and subcutaneous_tissue toward the wound and for a time_period sufficient to facilitate closure of the wound`
claim 2 of the ¡¬081_patent and claim 42 of the ¡¬651_patent are illustrative 2
an apparatus for facilitating the healing of wounds comprising *1347 vacuum_means for creating a negative_pressure between about 0.big_token__1_and_0__big_token99 atmospheres on the area of skin including and surrounding the wound ; sealing means operatively associated with said vacuum_means for maintaining said negative_pressure on said wound by contacting the skin surrounding said wound ; and
open-cell polymer for positioning at the wound within the sealing means for preventing the over-growth of tissue in the wound
¡¬081_patent col.9 ll.50-65
42
a method of treating a wound comprising the steps of i. providing a vacuum_source capable of providing at least 0.11 atm of reduced_pressure ; ii
locating a flexible adhesive cover over the wound said cover having a suction_port ; iii
locating a porous material comprising a synthetic polymer under said cover at the wound ; iv
adhesively sealing and adhering the periphery of said cover to tissue surrounding the wound to form a continuous seal ; v. operably connecting said suction_port with said vacuum system for producing said reduced_pressure ; vi
interposing a fluid trap between said suction_port and said vacuum_source ; and vii
maintaining reduced_pressure of at least 0.11 atm at the wound until the wound had progressed toward a selected stage of healing
¡¬651_patent col.25 ll.31-48

figure 1 of the ¡¬651_patent discloses the key components of the claimed apparatus

?
*1348 as depicted in this figure the claimed apparatus includes 1 a vacuum_pump 30 ; 2 tubing 12 ; 3 an open-celled foam wound screen 10 ; and 4 an adhesive_seal 18
¡¬651_patent col.6 ll.31-61 ; see also ¡¬081_patent col.2 ll.30-35` fig._1 shows a cross-sectional view of a negative_pressure device comprising a open-cell polymer screen a flexible hose connecting the foam section to a suction pump and a flexible polymer sheet overlying the foam-hose assembly to provide the necessary seal`
to utilize the apparatus` [ f ] irst the open cell foam is cut to fit the shape of the wound and placed inside the wound
then the adhesive_seal is placed over the foam that is inside the wound'

once the seal is in place` [ o ] ne end of the tubing is placed through the seal into the foam and the other end is attached to the vacuum_pump
the vacuum_pump is turned on and because of the tight_seal around the wound the edges of the wound immediately begin to move together'

prior_art
in the present_litigation s & n asserted prior_art that generally falls into three primary categories 1 the bagautdinov_references ; 2 the zamierowski_reference ; and 3 the chariker-jeter_references
on appeal there is no dispute that these references are all prior_art

a. bagautdinov references
the bagautdinov_references consist of two articles written by dr._bagautdinov
*1349 the first reference` bagautdinov i' was published in 1986
joint appendix` j.a'
10001-03
it discusses` a method for vacuum treatment of primary and secondary purulent_wounds'
j.a
10002
the reference describes the method as follows after surgical_treatment of the purulent_wound and hemostasis a drain of polyurethane_foam adapted in shape and size is placed on the surface or in the cavity
the surrounding skin is smeared with sterile vaseline antiseptic or inert salve on an oil base and covered with a polyethylene_film..
regardless of the method of sealing a tube is hermetically installed onto the foam through a hole in the polyethylene made beforehand
the latter is connected to the vacuum_pump through a collection vessel
at a vacuum of 10_to_60 mmhg the film clenches the wound strictly along its skin boundaries with uniform vacuum treatment of the walls only on the side of the cavity and elimination of exudate because of the porous_structure of the drain
the duration of the treatment sessions depends on the degree of vacuum and ranges from 30 minutes to 2 hours whereupon the polyethylene is removed and a gauze bandage emplaced
the sessions are conducted daily until the wound is clean
on average this procedure takes 3_to_4 days
id
bagautdinov i notes that use of this method` inevitably obtain [ s ] acceleration of the healing periods and rehabilitation of the patients'
j.a
10003
the second reference` bagautdinov_ii' was also published in 1986
j.a
10026-27
bagautdinov_ii describes application of a method similar to that described in bagautdinov i to 170 patients
j.a
10026
the method employed requires that [ i ] mmediately after surgical_treatment of the infected area in the commonly accepted manner or using a scalpel-1 laser a drain made from polyurethane_foam is placed in the wound
for sorption treatment it is first filled with activated charcoal powder
the wound is sealed with polyethylene_film in one of several ways depending on the localization of the purulent focus
vacuum aspiration is conducted through an aspiration tube using a constant suction pump
thus the polyethylene_film` clenches' the wound strictly along its edges and the sorbent makes secure contact with the walls
the porous_structure of the drain allows for removal of exudate and vacuumization of the wound only from the cavity side
the session lasts 1-2 hours with negative_pressure of 10-40 mmhg after which the isolation is removed
the drain is changed 1-2 times daily
vacuum treatment was continued for 3-4 days
j.a
10026-27
as a result of this method` [ o ] n average the wound became clean by day 4-5 with the appearance of granulated tissue..
the average duration of inpatient treatment was 11.8 bed days compared to 17.2 in the control group ; 61.7 % of the patients were released with healed wounds and did not require outpatient treatment'
j.a
10027

b. zamierowski reference
the zamierowski_reference is a patent cooperation treaty application filed on april_3,_1990
j.a
10057
the reference describes a` fluidic_connection_system.. for draining liquids from and introducing liquids to patients'
j.a
10059
as described by the reference the system which amounts to a wound_dressing consists of [ a ] semipermeable membrane including a pair of panels each having a perimeter *1350 and an edge strip
the membrane is formed by connecting the panel edge strips together to form a seam extending transversely across the membrane
the panels and the membrane include inner and outer_surfaces
a tube_opening extends through the seam between the panel edge strips and between the membrane inner and outer_surfaces
the membrane inner surface is coated with an adhesive for attachment to the skin of a patient
a tube or sheath includes a proximate end extending through the tube_opening and a distal end positioned in spaced relation from the membrane outer surface.. a passage extend [ s ] through the sheath between its ends
an inner conduit can be placed in the sheath_passage and can include a connection seal assembly for forming a fluid-tight_seal with the sheath..
when the fluidic_connection_system is used as a wound_dressing an intermediate layer of material can be applied between the wound and the cover membrane inner surface
furthermore the fluidic_connection_system of the present_invention can be used to secure a percutaneous drainage tube within a patient e.g
by inserting the percutanious tube through the sheath_passage..
the cover membrane can be releasably adhesively fastened to the skin around a periphery thereof
a tube fluidically communicates with the wound through an opening in the membrane
fluids from a draining wound can be evacuated through the tube and liquid medication and irrigation can be introduced through the tube to the wound_site
the fluid evacuation and introduction steps of the method can each be accomplished both actively and passively.. j.a
10061-63
the reference indicates that this wound_dressing` promotes healing'
j.a
10063

c. chariker-jeter_references
the chariker-jeter_references consist of two published articles` chariker-jeter_i' and` chariker-jeter_ii' respectively j.a
10044-47 ; j.a
10050-56 and dr._charikers 1989 public_use of the system described in the articles on gary aderholt` chariker-jeter_public_use'
both chariker-jeter_i and chariker-jeter_ii describe the same` closed wound drainage_system'
j.a
10052
as described in chariker-jeter_ii the drainage_system is created by 1
irrigat [ ing ] the wound_bed thoroughly with normal_saline using a 30ml syringe with a 19-gauge needle
2
moisten one 2x2 gauze square with normal_saline
open completely and lay across the wound_bed
3
place jackson-pratt drain in wound_bed
shorten the fenestrated drain as necessary so that the flat drain is confined to the wound_bed
the drain is never placed in the fistula2 tract
in the case of fistula drainage at skin_level the fenestrated portion of the drain is simply centered over the cutaneous opening
it may be helpful to encircle the cutaneous wound with a pectin-based skin barrier in order to create a` trough' in which to situate the fenestrated drain

4
saturate 4x4 gauze squares with normal_saline
open and fluff into wound to completely cover the drain and fill the defect to skin_level
in the case of a cutaneous fistula only enough moist *1351 gauze to cover the flat fenestrated drain is required
5
apply skin sealant bard barrier film skin-prep etc
to all skin that will be covered by the film_dressing
allow to dry until slick
6
cut the film_dressing or select a size to allow at least 1inch of intact skin beyond the wound edges
place the film_dressing over the packed wound
carefully crimp the adhesive film_dressing around the jackson-pratt tube to seal
7
`` caulk' the tube exit site with a small amount of stomahesive paste where the film_dressing is crimped around the tube
this ensures air-tight closure
8
reinforce this site with waterproof` pink_tape' as illustrated
9
turn your attention now to the connection of the jackson-pratt to continuous_suction
( do not attempt to use the bulb of the jackson-pratt system
with some brands of canister and tubing all that is necessary is to cut the funnel end off the tubing and the small j-p tubing will fit snugly into the larger lumen tube
the junction should be taped securely with pink_tape
otherwise you may use small` christmas tree' connector or cannibalize iv tubing to get a small plastic adapter to connect the tubing
10
turn on continuous_suction to the upper range of the low setting approximately 60_to_80 mmhg and observe the wound_site
the dressing should contract noticeably
if it does not the system is not closed and wound drainage will not be efficiently removed
when this occurs fistula drain age will accumulate causing skin damage and leakage outside of the dressing
another indication that you have not obtained a closed suction system is a whistling sound indicating that the dressing is not air-tight
j.a
10052 footnote added
chariker-jeter_ii explains that` [ o ] ur clinical observations suggest that fistula effluent does inhibit wound_healing.. by minimizing the inflammatory response [ associated with the presence of effluent ] fibroplasia is reduced
this we believe encourages rapid wound contraction and re-epithelialization'
j.a
10055
finally with respect to the chariker-jeter_public_use dr._chariker testified that he treated mr._aderholt in 1989 with his closed suction wound drainage_system
`` [ mr._aderholt ] was injured with a log chain that flew off another truck into his truck entered his chest his abdomen ruptured his lung his [ diaphragm ] his pancreas his spleen his stomach'
j.a
22032:8-11
with the aid of pictures of mr._aderholts treatment dr._chariker stated that his treatment was an example of the drainage_system facilitating the healing of a wound on a patient without a fistula
j.a
22035:6-38:11

iii
prior litigation
in 2003 wake_forest and kci sued blue_sky_medical group inc.` blue_sky' et al. alleging that its gauze based negative_pressure wound_therapy products infringed u.s._patent_no._5636,6433` ¡¬643_patent` and the ¡¬081_patent
at trial a jury found the patents were not infringed not invalid and not unenforceable
at the close of trial defendants filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law alleging that *1352 the asserted_claims of the ¡¬643 and ¡¬081_patent s were invalid as obvious under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103
the district_court denied that motion

on appeal this court affirmed the jurys finding that invalidity was not established and that the asserted_claims were not infringed
blue_sky 554 f.3d at 1025-26
in reaching that conclusion however we determined that the district_court committed harmless error by failing to construe the term` wound'
id.at 1019
while we did not provide a definitive construction of` wound' we concluded that construing`wound to include fistulae andpus_pockets would [ ] expand the scope of the claims far beyond anything described in the specification'
id
significantly for the present appeal we also concluded that` wound'` as used in the asserted patents does not cover the fistulae described in the chariker-jeter_publications..' id.at 1018

iv
present litigation
during the appeal in the prior litigation s & n acquired blue_sky
in december 2008 s & n announced it was launching a new foam-based negative_pressure wound treatment product
responding to this announcement wake_forest and kci filed this suit asserting that s & ns renasys product infringed the asserted patents

after conducting a markman hearing the district_court construed various terms recited in the claims
for this appeal the courts construction of only the term` wound' is relevant ; it construed this term to mean` tissue_damage to the surface of the body including the epithelial and subcutaneous layers and excluding fistulae and pus_pockets'

before the case was given to the jury for determination the parties disagreed about the form and content of the jury_instructions
wake_forest and kci had demanded a trial by jury
in response s & n moved the district_court to strike the jury demand with respect to questions of law including the ultimate_question of obviousness

jan._21,_2010 ecf no._397` motion to strike`
prior to ruling on the merits of the motion to strike the district_court conducted an on-the-record pre-trial hearing
during the hearing s & n made clear that it wanted the jury to make findings with respect to the factors under graham v. john deere co. of kansas city 383_u.s._1 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966) and reserve the ultimate_question of obviousness for the judge

grp. inc. no._08- cv-102 w.d.tex
jan._25,_2010` pre-trial conference transcript`
to facilitate this division of responsibility s & n proposed a special_interrogatory_verdict_form [ t ] he way its done and the way the models show.. is the jury make [ s ] findings under graham v. john deere
if the jury is actually asked what is the level of skill in the art thats one of the graham findings
what is the scope and content of the prior_art.. [ w ] e proposed and gave to kci a two-page set of questions where we are specifically asking the jury to make findings as to whether or not the prior_art contains a particular suggestion
*1353 id.at 16
under this proposal the trial_judge would resolve the ultimate_question of obviousness on the basis of the jurys factual_findings as exemplified in their answers to the interrogatories

wake_forest and kci expressed the belief that this proposal was` one of the worst ideas of all time' because it would make the process so complicated that the jury could not get it right thereby` taking away from the jury the power they have been given by the constitution'
id.at 23
highlighting their concern with s & ns proposed verdict_form wake_forest and kci explained that` its not two pages but actually five pages of questions
two pages that look like this of detailed questions about whether the prior_art discloses teeny tiny aspects of the patent and two questions that call for a narrative answer from the jury'
id.at 26
responding to this criticism the trial_judge indicated that he was` very reluctant.. to give juries questions requiring narrative answers'
id.at 27

the trial_judge summarized the parties arguments as both saying essentially the same thing` [ n ] o_matter how i present this to the jury i have to make a separate_determination as to obviousness
even if i were to submit this to the jury in a broad form submission-just is it obvious-regardless of what the jury said my analysis would have to require that i do my own look at the matter from a legal point of view..' id.at 30
the trial_judge concluded the discussion of the motion to strike by indicating that he would read the materials presented by the parties and consider using special_interrogatories
he cautioned however that` while im open to a special_interrogatory_presentation im not open to a special_interrogatory_presentation that goes on and on and on'
id.at 30-31

four days after conducting the pre-trial hearing the district_court denied s & ns request that it not submit the ultimate_question of obviousness to the jury

jan._29,_2010 order granting in part and denying in part defendants motion to strike plaintiffs jury demand on questions of law ecf no._407
it concluded that` [ t ] he jury_instructions shall explain the underlying_factual_issues that the jury must resolve as well as the legal_standard for determining obviousness
additionally the jury_verdict_form shall specifically ask the jury to determine the underlying graham_factors and make a final determination of obviousness that the court will consider as advisory'
id.at 5

in accordance with this ruling the parties began developing proposed joint jury_instructions and a special_verdict_form
at the close of the presentation of evidence the parties were still developing the instructions and the verdict_form

grp. inc. no._08- cv-102 w.d.tex
feb._23,_2010` day 10 trial_transcript`
because the jury_instructions and verdict_form were not complete and there was some disagreement over the exact form the documents should take the district_court held a charge_conference to resolve any remaining disputes and finalize the instructions and the verdict_form
at this stage in the proceeding the obviousness verdict_form proffered by s & n was eighteen pages in length and wake_forest and kcis was slightly more than seven pages in length
id.at 2969-70
each of the proposed verdict_forms contained specific questions addressing the differences if any between the asserted_claims and the three categories of prior_art discussed above
after reviewing the proposals *1354 the judge stated` i really ca n't give them this..
i may have to try to figure out something else to give them but this wo n't work'
id.at 2985

the judge explained his belief that if the verdict_form only posed the ultimate_question to the jury the court would be left with little guidance regarding the factual predicate for the jurys resolution of that issue
id.at 2990-91
the district_court therefore expressed its preference to ask the jury specific questions about the various graham_factors in addition to asking the jury its view on the ultimate_conclusion of obviousness
id.at 2992-94

after discussing the various options with the parties the judge decided that the best option was to allow the parties to draft a 300-word description of what the parties asserted were the differences between the three main_categories of prior_art and each of the asserted_claims
these` jury contentions' would be included in the jury_instructions
then the jury_verdict_form would ask what differences if any the jury found between the given claim and the three main_categories of prior_art providing space for the jury to list the differences in a narrative
id.at 2997-3006

with these guidelines the judge dismissed the parties to finish drafting the jury_instructions and verdict_form explaining that that they would meet that evening when the instructions and verdict_form were complete
id.at 3003-04
the judge advised the parties however that` if youve got any better idea on obviousness that you can agree to ill be glad to do it but what youve come up with so far were not going to do
and so if you ca n't come up with anything then you just have to do it the way i said which i think is not optimal'
id.at 3062

when the parties met that night with the judge a court reporter was not present so there is no record of the discussion
it is clear from looking at the jury_instructions and the verdict_form as presented to the jury however that the parties and the judge agreed to use a different format than suggested by the judge at the close of the charge_conference
although the jury_instructions contain a discussion of the parties contentions regarding the differences between the prior_art and the claims jury_trial tr

feb._24,_2010` day 11 trial_transcript` the verdict_form did not allow the jury to provide a narrative about which differences they found to exist nor did it pose questions regarding all of the graham_factors
j.a
65-89
instead in questions 5 a - c the jury was asked whether several enumerated differences between the prior_art and the asserted_claims were the only differences that existed
the jury was simply instructed to answer yes or no
in addition in question 5 d the verdict_form contained a chart that allowed the jury to indicate whether they found certain objective_indicia of nonobviousness to be present with respect to each of the asserted_claims
j.a
70
finally in question 6 the verdict_form asked the jury to decide whether s & n had proven that the asserted_claims were obvious
j.a

the jury determined that the claims and the prior_art exhibited differences in addition to those listed j.a
64-69 that most of the objective considerations favoring nonobviousness were present with respect to each claim that infringement was proven and that obviousness was not established
j.a
62-63 ; 71
after the verdict was read to the parties the district_court indicated that the parties should prepare post-trial motions if they wished to challenge the jurys verdict

mar._10,_2010` jury verdict transcript`

pursuant to rule 50 b of the federal rules of civil procedure s & n moved for jmol arguing that all of the asserted_claims of the ¡¬081 and ¡¬651_patent s were obvious
in its motion s & n asserted that substantial_evidence did not support the jurys explicit_findings that 1 additional_differences between the prior_art and the asserted_claims existed and 2 that multiple objective_indicia of nonobviousness were present

responding to s & ns motion wake_forest and kci argued that in addition to the explicit jury findings the jurys implicit findings necessary to determine the ultimate_question of obviousness should be presumed to have been found in wake_forest and kcis favor
furthermore these findings both explicit and implicit should not be disturbed by the trial_court unless they are not supported by substantial_evidence
in light of this standard wake_forest and kci asserted that substantial_evidence supported the jurys factual_determinations 1 that additional_differences existed between the prior_art and the asserted_claims ; 2 that objective_indicia of nonobviousness were present ; and 3 that teaching away was demonstrated with respect to the bagautdinov and chariker-jeter_references
on the basis of these findings wake_forest and kci asserted that s & ns motion should be denied because it failed to establish that the asserted_claims were obvious as a matter of law

based upon this understanding of how the jurys verdict should be reviewed by the district_court s & n argued that the asserted_claims were obvious as a matter of law

prior to ruling on the merits of s & ns motion the court conducted a hearing
s & n began by arguing that because the jurys verdict on the ultimate_question of obviousness was advisory it is inappropriate to` just assume every finding of fact in favor of' the jurys nonobviousness_verdict

indeed s & n argued that implied findings of fact only arose with respect to questions 5 a - c regarding additional_differences and 5 d regarding the existence of objective_indicia of nonobviousness
id.at 133-34 36
`` it is not simply enough to say the jury found obviousness implied every finding of fact in our favor which is what kci is arguing and therefore the verdict should be upheld
not true
they are only entitled to implied findings to the extent they are encompassed by the verdict question 5 not 6'
id.at 136
s & n argued that substantial_evidence did not support the jurys factual_finding that additional *1356 patentably significant differences existed between the prior_art and the asserted_claims and that objective_indicia of nonobviousness were present

wake_forest and kci on the other_hand argued that the jurys verdict on the ultimate_question of obviousness is always advisory because as a question of law it must be determined by the court
see id.at 153
nonetheless` the case law is absolutely clear that.. [ w ] hen the jury finds that [ the claims ] are not obvious you have to assume that they find the right underlying facts and then the test is substantial_evidence' for the underlying factual_findings
id.at 155
under this standard wake_forest and kci argued that substantial_evidence supported the jurys explicit and implicit_factual_findings and that s & ns motion should have been denied

ultimately the district_court indicated that it would` review [ ] the jurys conclusions on obviousness a question of law without deference and the underlying findings of fact whether explicit or implicit within the verdict for substantial_evidence'
jmol_order at 8
after thoroughly summarizing the relevant prior_art the district_court concluded that contrary to the jurys explicit_findings` the differences between the claimed invention and the prior_art if any are minimal'
id.at 18
indeed the district_court concluded that the differences were so minor that` such minimal variations would have been apparent to one having ordinary_skill in the art..' id.at 34
the court concluded therefore that` the evidence is clear and convincing that there is no legally sufficient basis on the record to conclude that all asserted_claims of the patents in suit were not obvious'
id
the fact that the jury also found that several objective_indicia of nonobviousness were present did not alter the district_courts conclusion because it said` the court is not convinced that they overcome the strong case of obviousness established by the teaching in the prior_art'
id.at 35

in the face of what amounts to well settled law s & n argues that because the jurys verdict in this case was` advisory'` no factual_findings implied within the advisory_verdict are binding..' appellees br.at 39
s & n asserts therefore that we should review only the jurys explicit_factual_findings with respect to questions 5 a - d for substantial_evidence
because the jurys advisory_verdict on the ultimate_question of obviousness gave rise to no implied factual_findings s & n contends the district_court was free to make its own_findings of fact with respect to all issues not submitted to the jury
id.at 39-40
according to s & n we should review these factual_findings for clear error
finally s & n argues that the district_courts ultimate_conclusion regarding obviousness should be reviewed de novo in light of the factual_findings we find to be supported by the evidence
we disagree

although s & n is correct that the district_court repeatedly referred to the jury in this case as` advisory' s & n is wrong about the implications use of that term carries
we first address the ways in which the phrase` advisory_jury' is used by trial_courts

the term is sometimes used to refer to rule 39 c 1 juries
fed.r.civ.p
39 c 1` in an action not triable of right by a jury the court on motion or on its own may try any issue with an advisory_jury..'
under rule 39 c 1 when an` advisory_jury' is used no jury findings-either explicit or implicit-are binding on the trial_court and the court is obligated to make independent findings of fact and conclusions of law on the issue presented to the jury
s & n first claims that the district_court submitted the matter to the jury under rule 39 c 1 and that accordingly neither the trial_court nor we are bound by the jurys factual_findings
we disagree

we do not believe that the district_court intended to invoke rule 39 c 1 when it referred to an` advisory_jury'
first a rule 39 c 1 advisory_jury is available only in an action not triable by right to a jury
id
but patent infringement actions must be tried to a jury if demanded by a party
markman v. westview instruments inc. 517_u.s._370 377 116_s.ct._1384 134_l.ed.2d_577_(1996)
second s & n did not ask and the district_court did not make special findings that rule 52 requires in all actions tried` with an advisory_jury'
fed.r.civ.p
52` [ t ] he court must find the facts specially and state its conclusions of law separately
`` ; see also transmatic inc. v. gulton indus. inc. 53_f.3d_1270 1275 fed.cir.1995` when as here trial is held before the district_court with an advisory_jury the court must find the facts specially just as it would when conducting a bench trial without an advisory_jury'
( citing in re incident aboard the d/b ocean king 758_f.2d_1063 1072 5th cir.1985
and rather than filing a motion to have the judgment amended under rule 52 b *1358 which applies to actions tried before a rule 39 c 1 advisory_jury s & n filed a motion pursuant to rule 50 which governs` judgment as a matter of law in a jury_trial
`` 5_fed.r.civ.p._50
finally s & n concedes that the district_court and we must defer to the jurys explicit_factual_findings a concession that is inconsistent with its reliance on rule 39 c 1
it is clear therefore that the court did not use the term` advisory_jury' to denote a rule 39 c 1 jury.6

as a consequence all of the cases cited by s & n for the proposition that there are` no factual_findings implied within the advisory_verdict [ that ] are binding on the district_court' are irrelevant because all of the cases involved actions that are not triable to a jury by right and all addressed rule 39 c 1 advisory juries
e.g. am calcar inc. v. am
honda motor co. 651_f.3d_1318 1333 fed.cir.2011` inequitable conduct is equitable in nature with no right to a jury and the trial_court has the obligation to resolve the underlying facts of materiality and intent'
( citation omitted ; sheilas shine prods. inc. v. sheila shine inc. 486_f.2d_114 122 5th cir.1973
whether the jurys verdict on obviousness gave rise to implied factual_findings is not therefore controlled by these cases

the term` advisory_jury' can also be used to denote a jurys resolution of a legal_issue that the court can permissibly give to the jury to decide but whose ultimate determination is reserved for the court
see e.g. spectralytics inc. v. cordis_corp. 649_f.3d_1336 1341-42 fed.cir.2011 ; r.r
dynamics inc. v. a. stucki co. 727_f.2d_1506 1515 fed.cir.1984
as we have explained [ i ] t is neither error nor dangerous to justice to submit legal_issues to juries the submission being accompanied by appropriate instructions on the law from the trial_judge
the rules relating to interrogatories jury_instructions motions for directed verdict jnov and new_trial and the rules governing appeals following jury_trials are fully adequate to provide for interposition of the judge as guardian of the law at the proper point and when necessary
there is no question that the judge must *1359 remain the ultimate arbiter on the question of obviousness
he or she exercises that role first in exercising the judges duty of giving proper instructions on the law to the jury before it considers its verdict
the judge exercises control on the question again when presented with a motion for jnov or new_trial
in no sense need the judge abdicate the guardianship role
r.r
dynamics 727 f.2d at 1515
this appears to be the manner in which the district_court used the term` advisory_jury'
pre-trial conference transcript at 16-22` [ n ] o_matter how i present this to the jury i have to make a separate_determination as to obviousness`
this conclusion is buttressed by the fact that the patent_case_management_judicial_guide which the district_court explained it reviewed with respect to this issue suggests this use of the term` advisory_jury'
peter s. menell et al. patent_case_management_judicial_guide 8-32 2009` [ t ] he court can submit only the relevant graham_factors to the jury for its determination through special_interrogatories with or without an advisory_verdict on the legal_question of obviousness and then determine the ultimate_question of obviousness itself based on the jurys factual_determinations
``

with this understanding of the district_courts use of the term` advisory_jury' we now address s & ns remaining argument regarding the standard of review
s & n asserts that the district_court utilized a rule 49 a special_interrogatory_verdict_form
based on this contention s & n asserts that there are no implied factual_findings to which deference is due because a party waives its right to a jury_trial on factual_issues for which the party did not demand a special interrogatory and` factual_issues not submitted to the jury as special_interrogatories are deemed decided by the district_court in accordance with the courts judgment'
appellee br.at 40

s & n is incorrect
first a court employing a fed.r.civ.p
49 special_verdict_form can only require the jury to return such findings as to` each issue of fact'
rule 49 a 1
because the ultimate_conclusion of obviousness is a legal_question there is strength to the argument that by including that question on its verdict_form the court chose to employ a general_verdict with answers to written questions governed by rule 49 b
it is clear that factual_findings in support of the general_verdict are implied when a verdict_form under rule 49 b is used
see quaker city gear works inc. v. skil corp. 747_f.2d_1446 1453 fed.cir.1984 explaining that when a rule 49 a verdict_form includes a legal_question` since the answer to the legal_question necessarily resolves any disputed underlying_factual_issues we have undertaken to review the factual_findings on which the legal_conclusion is based applying the substantial_evidence standard'
( citation omitted
furthermore we have indicated that while it is not error to submit legal_questions to the jury as part of a rule 49 a special_verdict_form` since the answer to the legal_question necessarily resolves any disputed underlying_factual_issues' the court must accept implicit_factual_findings upon which the legal_conclusion is based when they are supported by substantial_evidence
id
( citing connell v. sears roebuck & co. 722_f.2d_1542 1550 fed.cir.1983 ; see also gaia techs inc. v. recycled prods corp. 175_f.3d_365 371 5th cir.1999` rule 49 a does not permit a district_court to make findings contrary to the jury verdict`
in essence because the district *1360 court included the ultimate_question of obviousness on the special_verdict_form all of the factual_determinations underlying the ultimate_question were implicitly put to the jury for resolution
wake_forest did not therefore waive a jury_trial on any factual issue not submitted to the jury in an interrogatory and the district_court was required to accept all implicit_factual_findings supporting the jurys conclusion with respect to the ultimate_conclusion of obviousness that were supported by substantial_evidence

accordingly we review all of the jurys explicit and implicit_factual_findings for substantial_evidence
we then examine the legal_conclusion of obviousness de novo to determine whether it is correct in light of the factual_findings that we find adequately supported
jurgens 927 f.2d at 1557

i
a patent is obvious and therefore invalid` if the differences between the subject_matter sought to be patented and the prior_art are such that the subject_matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary_skill in the art to which said subject_matter pertains'

obviousness is a question of law based on underlying factual_findings 1 the scope and content of the prior_art ; 2 the differences between the claims and the prior_art ; 3 the level of ordinary_skill in the art ; and 4 objective_indicia of nonobviousness
graham 383 u.s. at 17-18 86_s.ct._684
a party seeking to invalidate a patent on the basis of obviousness must` demonstrateby clear and convincing_evidence that a skilled_artisan would have been motivated to combine the teachings of the prior_art_references to achieve the claimed invention and that the skilled_artisan would have had a reasonable expectation of success in doing so

while an analysis of any teaching suggestion or motivation to combine elements from different prior_art_references is useful in an obviousness_analysis the overall inquiry must be expansive and flexible

this court has explained moreover that the obviousness inquiry requires examination of all four graham_factors
e.g. mintz v. dietz & watson inc. 679_f.3d_1372 1375 fed.cir.2012
indeed courts must consider all of the graham_factors prior to reaching a conclusion with respect to obviousness

id.at 1077-78

because wake_forest asserts that the district_court erred by granting judgment as a matter of law overturning the jurys verdict we must determine which of the jurys explicit and implicit_factual_findings with respect to the graham_factors are supported by substantial_evidence
each of the graham_factors is addressed in turn below

a
scope and content of the prior_art
the parties agree on which references are prior_art
on appeal s & n *1361 focuses its obviousness_analysis on the bagautdinov_references zamierowski_reference and the chariker-jeter_references
with respect to these references the parties dispute their content,7 namely whether the prior_art discloses the treatment of wounds with negative_pressure
this is the central issue on appeal because all of the asserted_claims covering either the method or apparatus require the use of negative_pressure to either` treat a wound' or` facilitate the healing of wound
`` 8 the district_court concluded that there was no support for the proposition that these primary_references did not disclose the treatment of wounds utilizing negative_pressure
jmol_order at 25 27-28 33
as explained below this was error substantial_evidence supports the jurys implied factual_finding that none of these references disclosed the treatment of wounds using negative_pressure

1
content of the bagautdinov references
the bagautdinov_references disclose a device for draining fluid from purulent_wounds
the device involves placement of a polyurethane_foam in the purulent_wound attaching the foam to a pump and covering the apparatus and the wound with a polyethylene_film secured to the skin with vaseline oil
j.a
10002

the jury was presented with conflicting evidence regarding whether the references treated wounds as construed by the district_court and if they did whether they treated wounds with negative_pressure
s & ns experts contended that the references disclosed the treatment of wounds within the meaning of the asserted_claims
see j.a
22345:13-17 testimony of dr. gordon s & ns expert stating that bagautdinov i disclosed the use of negative_pressure to treat a wound
in addition dr._bagautdinov displayed the method disclosed in the references to the jurors with the aid of a manikin
j.a
22204-05

wake_forest presented conflicting testimony however
it proffered expert_testimony that the purulent_wounds described in the bagautdinov_references are in fact abscess or pus_pockets not within the district_courts construction of the term` wound'
j.a
22871:19-21` dr._bagautdinov is using a variant or modification of a technique to aspirate or to suck out pus from a purulent_wound which is a pus_pocket
`` ; j.a
21431:15-23 discussing how bagautdinov treated pus_pockets by lancing and then draining them with the disclosed method
in addition wake_forests expert testified that the bagautdinov_references indicate that use of the device is discontinued when the purulent_wound has been cleaned of infection whereas the patented method and apparatus are utilized only after a wound has been cleaned of infection
j.a
22878:7-80:16
s & ns expert conceded moreover that the bagautdinov articles were` particularly concerned about the problems related to putting negative_pressure on the area of skin surrounding the wound and the risk of spreading infection causing tissue_damage..' j.a
22343:5-8
in *1362 other_words the bagautdinov_references explain that use of negative_pressure on or surrounding a wound is dangerous to the patient
this amounts to teaching away
ricoh co. v. quanta computer inc. 550_f.3d_1325 1332 fed.cir.2008 quoting in re kahn 441_f.3d_977 990 fed.cir.2006` a reference may be said to teach away when a person of ordinary_skill upon reading the reference would be discouraged from following the path set out in the reference or would be led in a direction divergent from the path that was taken by the applicant
``

finally wake_forest presented testimony that the method disclosed in the bagautdinov_references could not create an adequate seal j.a
21437:25-38:2 ; j.a
21433:2-15 and did not treat wounds through negative_pressure because the pressure was not sustained for a long_enough_period of time
j.a
21433:18-34:11 ; j.a
21437:19-38:2
indeed dr._bagautdinov admitted that he only used his device to treat` infected wounds' j.a
22312:15-22 and that he` never considered using [ his ] technique to treat wounds until closure'
j.a
22310:17-21

because of this conflicting expert_testimony the jury was free to` make credibility_determinations and believe the witness it considers more trustworthy'
streber v. hunter 221_f.3d_701 726 5th cir.2000 quotations omitted
in light of the jurys determination that s & n failed to prove obviousness we must infer that the jury found wake_forests experts to be credible and persuasive on this point
broussard 523 f.3d at 624 ; jurgens 927 f.2d at 1557
crediting their testimony over that of s & ns expert there is substantial_evidence supporting the factual_finding that the bagautdinov_references do not disclose 1 the treatment of` wounds' as described in patents ; or 2 use of negative_pressure to treat wounds
there is also substantial_evidence to support the finding that the references teach away from maintaining negative_pressure on a wound for extended_periods of time because of the perceived problems associated with doing so

2
content of the zamierowski reference
the parties agree that the zamierowski_references method is utilized on` wounds' within the district_courts construction and discloses placing a screen means into a wound sealing the wound by placing a membrane with an adhesive coating over the wound and connecting a tube from under the membrane to a vacuum_source
j.a
28
this system can then be used to either drain from or inject fluid into the wound
j.a
10063
s & n argues and the district_court found that the zamierowski_reference also disclosed treating wounds with negative_pressure
jmol_order at 27-28

during trial wake_forest argued that this reference does not disclose healing wounds with negative_pressure because it neither disclosed a seal capable of maintaining negative_pressure on a wound nor disclosed treating the wound towards a selected stage of healing as required by the asserted method claims

the district_court concluded that wake_forests first argument was incorrect because it found that the patent claims do not require healing to be accomplished by negative_pressure
id.at 27
in the alternative the district_court concluded that the zamierowski_reference met this requirement because fluid is removed from the wound with negative_pressure and removal *1363 of fluid enabled healing so` healing' was` accomplished by the negative_pressure'
id.at 27-28

the district_court was incorrect with respect to its determination that the claims of the asserted patents do not require wounds to be healed by negative_pressure
first in the blue_sky appeal we concluded that all of the claims of the ¡¬081_patent asserted in the present_litigation require the use of negative_pressure to treat a` wound'
554 f.3d at 1015` [ e ] ach of the asserted_claims in both the ¡¬081 and ¡¬643_patent s requires usingreduced ornegative pressure totreat a wound orfacilitate the healing of a wound..`
thus we have already construed the claims to include this limitation and that legal_conclusion was binding on the district_court and is binding on this panel
the specifications of both the ¡¬081 and ¡¬ 651 patents support our conclusion in blue_sky moreover
e.g. ¡¬081_patent col.2 ll.45-49` the present_invention includes.. applying a negative_pressure to a wound over an area sufficient to promote migration of epithelial and subcutaneous_tissue toward the wound with the negative_pressure being maintained for a time sufficient to facilitate closure of the wound
`` ; ¡¬651_patent col.2 11.61-64` [ a ] wound treatment apparatus is provided for treating a wound by applying reduced_pressure.. to the wound..'
and before the pto the patentees distinguished their claims from the prior_art by asserting that references` do not disclose or suggestan appliance for administering a reduced_pressure treatment to a wound ;an apparatus/method for treating a wound with reduced_pressure'
j.a
5501651_patent ; see also j.a
5502651_patent ; j.a
8267081_patent unlike the prior_art` [ the ] claimed invention is directed to a device configured to create and maintain negative_pressure on a wound_site.. for the purpose of administering a negative_pressure treatment to the wound`
finally s & n never argued before the district_court that the asserted_claims did not require this limitation
in light of our prior holding in blue_sky the language of the specification and the patentees statements made during reexamination we find that each of the asserted_claims requires the use of negative_pressure to heal or treat wounds

with respect to the district_courts alternative holding whether the prior_art discloses the limitations of a particular claim is a question of fact to be determined by the jury and wake_forest presented ample_evidence that the zamierowski_reference does not disclose the use of negative_pressure to heal wounds
j.a
21453:19-25 ; j.a
22667:24-70:10 ; j.a
22866:19-68:12

in support of its argument that the zamierowski_reference does not disclose a seal capable of maintaining negative_pressure wake_forest presented testimony that the reference does not create a seal within the meaning of the patent because it uses only a tight liquid seal that has air gaps
j.a
21472:19-73:11 ; j.a
22668:25-69:4
this testimony is consistent with the reference which indicates that the dressing material is` breathable semipermeable' and the seal is` relatively liquid-tight'
j.a
10068 ; j.a
10070
with respect to the contention that` healing' is not accomplished as contemplated by the patents wake_forests expert testified that the zamierowski_reference failed to disclose maintaining negative_pressure until the wound has progressed to a selected stage of healing
j.a
22456:24-58:1 ; j.a
22669:5-8
zamierowski instead uses a *1364 tubing system to medicate and drain wounds and thereby` promote [ ] healing' generally j.a
10061-63 ; j.a
10074 ; it does not disclose the use and maintenance of negative_pressure on a wound_site to facilitate wound_closure and thereby promote wound_healing as do the patents
and unlike the system specified in the patents zamierowskis system is to be removed once the process of medication and draining has been completed
j.a
10073
indeed the inventor of the zamierowski device testified that the inventors of the ¡¬651 and ¡¬081_patent s invented the use of negative_pressure for wound_therapy and that he had not
j.a
22571:13-17 ; see also j.a
22571:10-12 zamierowski inventor indicating that his contribution to the commercial_embodiment of the asserted patents is primarily the methods of attaching the` the rigid conduit to the flimsy film'

because the jury concluded that s & n failed to establish that the patents were obvious we must assume that the jury found wake_forests expert to be credible and persuasive on this point
in light of this assumption there is substantial_evidence to support the factual_finding that the zamierowski_reference does not disclose a sealing means capable of maintaining negative_pressure or maintenance of pressure until the wound has progressed toward a selected stage of healing

3
content of the chariker-jeter_references
the chariker-jeter_references as explained above disclose a system for treating wounds that are complicated by a fistula
j.a
10043
the parties dispute whether these references disclose the treatment of a wound within the meaning of the patents and if it does disclose treatment of such_wounds whether the disclosed device used negative_pressure to treat the wounds
with the exception of the chariker-jeter_public_use the two chariker-jeter_publications indisputably deal only with the treatment of` [ p ] atients with draining wounds and fistulae'

in blue_sky we held that the term wound as used in these patents` does not cover the fistulae described in the [ chariker-jeter ] publications..' 554 f.3d at 1018
despite our conclusion that the injuries treated in the chariker-jeter_publications are not` wounds' within the meaning of these patents s & n presented testimony attempting to establish that the references disclosed such treatment
j.a
22348:1-49:12 ; j.a
22028:7-30:6
regarding the chariker-jeter_public_use which was not addressed in blue_sky s & n proffered the testimony of dr._chariker who while he was a resident helped treat mr._aderholt with the system disclosed in the chariker-jeter_publications
in this testimony dr._chariker testified that he used the system to heal mr._aderholt with negative_pressure
j.a
22032:2-38:11

wake_forest presented testimony to contradict s & ns evidence
its expert testified that all of the patients mentioned in the chariker-jeter_publications had fistulae and therefore that the publications do not disclose the treatment of wounds within the district_courts construction
j.a
21441:1-7 ; j.a
22672:11-23
in fact on cross_examination dr._chariker admitted that neither of the chariker-jeter_publications discloses wounds not involving a fistula
j.a
22045:15-25
wake_forests experts testified moreover that the device disclosed in the chariker-jeter_references did not use negative_pressure to treat wounds
j.a
22671:12-91:24 ; j.a
*1365 21439:1-41:22 ; j.a
22869:13-70:21
and wake_forests expert testified that the chariker-jeter_publications actually taught to limit granulization which is directly contrary to the purpose of the ¡¬651 and ¡¬081_patent s. j.a
21441:12-19` so according to their document they seem to want to limit granulation_tissue formation
`` ; j.a
22673:11-12` [ drs
chariker and jeter ] actually wanted to inhibit granulation_tissue
``

significantly dr._chariker conceded that he` did n't publish anything about negative_pressure wound_therapy regarding fistulas or nonfistulas'
j.a
22046:8-9
similarly dr. jeter admitted on cross_examination that she never suggested using the disclosed device if there was nothing to drain
j.a
22147:8-11

with respect to the chariker-jeter_public_use wake_forest offered testimony that mr._aderholts wound involved a fistula so it was not a wound within the meaning of the patents
j.a
22696:4-13 ; j.a
22698:22-99:5 ; j.a
22898:22-99:8
on cross_examination moreover dr._chariker refused to say that mr._aderholt did not have a fistula ; he only stated that one was never diagnosed
j.a
22057:23 ; j.a
22058:4 ; j.a
22085:2-6
in addition wake_forests expert testified that based on his reading of mr._aderholts operative notes and pictures of his treatment the system used on mr._aderholt was not the system disclosed in the chariker-jeter_publications
j.a
22714:25-15:9
wake_forests expert also testified that the chariker-jeter_public_use did not have a seal capable of maintaining negative_pressure because mr._aderholts skin had several sump drains that freely let air flow
j.a
2900:14-02:14
in other_words his wound was not healed with negative_pressure
j.a
2712:13-14:19

finally wake_forests experts testified that use of the drainage_system disclosed in the chariker-jeter_publications was discontinued when the fistula closed or substantial_drainage from the fistula stopped irrespective of the state of any wound_healing
j.a
22869:20-70:12 ; j.a
21438:13-39:18 ; j.a
22672:24-74:4 ; j.a
22870:3-5` in every single_case every single_case that they show in the book chapter and in the article the minute the fistula stopped draining they got rid of their device`
dr._chariker conceded this fact on cross_examination
j.a
22062:17-20
this again reasonably could be deemed a teaching away from continued long-term_use of the device as directed by the ¡¬081 and ¡¬651_patent s

again because of the procedural posture of this case we must assume that the jury found wake_forests experts credible and persuasive
rather than credit this testimony however the district_court impermissibly re-weighed witness credibility concluding that wake_forests experts testimony that mr._aderholt had a fistula was` completely unsupported by the evidence'
jmol_order at 32
this was error
see blue_sky 554 f.3d at 1020
on the basis of this credited testimony there is substantial_evidence to support the finding that 1 none of the chariker-jeter_references discloses treatment of a wound within the meaning of the patents as distinct from a fistula or pus_pocket ; 2 the chariker-jeter_references do not disclose use of negative_pressure to heal or treat wounds9 ; 3 the chariker-jeter_publications teach away from promoting *1366 healing by using negative_pressure ; 4 the chariker-jeter_public_use did not involve the device disclosed in the chariker-jeter_publications ; and 5 the public_use did not involve a seal capable of maintaining negative_pressure
finally with respect to the method claims substantial_evidence supports the finding that negative_pressure was not maintained until the wound progressed toward a selected stage of healing

b
level of ordinary skill in the art
although the parties did not stipulate the level of ordinary_skill in the art s & ns expert testified that the level of ordinary_skill in the art` would include health care professionals for example physicians or nurses but it could be a podiatrist or somebody else who has additional training or knowledge about wound_care
it could also be engineers with experience operating or designing equipment used in conjunction with wound_care'
j.a
22340:8-13
according to the district_court wake_forest asserted that the level of skill was higher
j.a
393
because it is generally easier to establish obviousness under a higher_level of ordinary_skill in the art innovention toys llc v. mga entm't inc. 637_f.3d_1314 1323 fed.cir.2011` a less sophisticated level of skill generally favors a determination of nonobviousness and thus the patentee while a higher_level of skill favors the reverse'
( citation omitted we must assume that in light of the jurys verdict it adopted the lower level of skill proposed by s & n

c. differences between the claimed invention and the prior_art
the jury explicitly found that the prior_art and the asserted_claims exhibited several differences which s & n conceded existed
j.a
65-69
in addition the jury stated that each of the prior_art_references exhibited additional_differences from those explicitly mentioned on the verdict_form although they were not asked to and thus did not identify those additional_differences

although there are many differences between the primary prior_art_references and the asserted_claims for the purpose of this appeal we need only focus on three
as discussed above substantial_evidence supports the finding that none of the references discloses treating wounds with negative_pressure as required by the patents
nor do the bagautdinov and chariker-jeter_references relate to the treatment of wounds described in the patents as construed by this court in blue_sky and the district_court here
finally the bagautdinov_references and the zamierowski_reference do not disclose a seal capable of maintaining negative_pressure
accordingly none of the references discloses healing or treatment with negative_pressure
only the zamierowski_reference discloses treating or healing wounds and only the chariker-jeter printed publications disclose a seal that is capable of maintaining pressure

even if the references disclosed all of the limitations of the asserted_claims which they do not s & n still needed to proffer evidence indicating why a person having ordinary_skill in the art would combine the references to arrive at the claimed invention
*1367 innogenetics n.v. v. abbott labs. 512_f.3d_1363 1374 fed.cir.2008 holding that post-ksr` some kind of motivation must be shown from some source so that the jury can understand why a person of ordinary_skill would have thought of either combining two or more references or modifying one to achieve the patented [ invention ]'
( citation omitted
significantly whether there is a reason to combine prior_art_references is a question of fact

here not only did s & n offer no evidence establishing a reason to combine but wake_forest offered substantial_evidence that a person having ordinary_skill in the art had no reason to combine the prior_art_references to arrive at the claimed invention
e.g. j.a
22669:18-25 ; j.a
22691:18-22 ; j.a
22715:25-16:4 ; j.a
22737:7-11 ; j.a
22753:24-54:3
in light of the jurys verdict we must assume that it determined there was no reason to combine the prior_art_references and we must defer to this factual_finding because it is supported by substantial_evidence

d. objective indicia of nonobviousness
with respect to the ¡¬081 asserted_claims the jury found the following indicia of nonobviousness 1 commercial_success ; 2 long felt need ; 3 copying ; 4 unexpected results ; 5 acceptance by others ; and 6 initial_skepticism
with respect to the ¡¬651 asserted_claims the jury found that for claims 109_and_116 on the basis of performing the method of claim 42 and claim 121 on the basis of performing the method of claim 42 the same indicia of nonobvious were present
regarding claim 116 on the basis of performing the method of claim 20 and claim 121 on the basis of performing the method of claim 20 the jury concluded that only copying existed

wake_forest presented testimony regarding each of the objective_indicia found by the jury
j.a
22827:3-32:10 ; j.a
217771:11-23 ; j.a
21077:19-79:15
wake_forest offered evidence that leading experts in the field were skeptical that the` counterintuitive' device could work
j.a
22827:3-12 j.a
22828:21-29:23 j.a
21078:4-79:5
one expert testified that he` did n't know how you could put this [ negative ] pressure on a wound and not cut off the blood supply not cause infection etc'
j.a
22827:3-9
indeed dr._argenta an inventor of the patents testified that the hospital where he worked was concerned about allowing him to try his device on a patient with a serious wound which could not be healed with conventional methods but the` decision [ was ] do you let [ the patient ] die or do you try something'
j.a
20446:3-23
to everyones surprise the device completely healed this patient
j.a
20446:21-47:6
the medical_community was so skeptical of the device moreover that the patents inventors had difficulty publishing their findings in peer-reviewed journals j.a
20501:1-19 reviewers from the journal plastic and reconstructive surgery stated that` there was no way that this was possible that this device could do this' and they were turned away by conference organizers when they attempted to present the discovery
j.a
20502:10-15 ; j.a
20501:3

despite this initial_skepticism over time the device was widely adopted and praised
j.a
22830:6-31:8 j.a
21079:10-12
wake_forest presented testimony from experts that the patented_device` changed the way we do surgery' j.a
21079:11-12 and` changed the way.. weve been treating wounds for the last twenty thirty years'
*big_token__1368_j.a._22831__big_token1-3
indeed s & ns own expert testified that the device was` a paradigm shift in wound_healing' and that it` is so effective that its changed the way that [ he ] and [ his ] fellow surgeons treat serious wounds'
j.a
22409:11-10:11
to date the device has been used on more than three million patients
j.a
21753:22-25
indeed harvard medical school called the device an` exciting novel therapeutic approach to wounds' j.a
20504:22-05:2 and the american association of plastic surgeons recognized the device as the last decades` biggest advance in the plastic surgery field'
j.a
22762:10-15
the effectiveness of the device and this praise has made it a commercial_success with $ 1.4 billion in annual sales
j.a
21771:12-13

finally wake_forest proffered testimony that the device has been copied
for example in internal documents and marketing materials s & n repeatedly compares its products to the v.a.c. the commercial_embodiment of the patents
j.a
22760:11-61:23 ; j.a
20537:17-39:18 ; j.a
20999:1-21
indeed s & ns expert admitted that he authored an article explaining how to create` an off-the-shelf or makeshift v.a.c'
j.a
22410:18-12:6

in the face of this evidence s & n offered no rebuttal evidence
s & ns own invalidity expert even admitted that he did not consider the objective_indicia of nonobviousness in reaching his conclusions regarding the invalidity of the patents
j.a
22396:20-97:8 ; j.a
22415:24-16:15
significantly the district_court concluded that wake_forest` present [ ed ] ample_evidence of success of v.a.c
product and the other secondary considerations tending to show non-obviousness'
j.a
37
on the basis of this record there is more than substantial_evidence supporting the jurys findings of commercial_success long-felt need copying unexpected and superior_results wide_spread_acceptance in the field and initial_skepticism

e. the ultimate conclusion of obviousness
having determined that the jurys explicit and several implicit_factual_findings are supported by substantial_evidence` we examine the [ ultimate ] legal_conclusion [ of obviousness ] de novo to see whether it is correct in light of' these factual_findings
jurgens 927 f.2d at 1557 internal_citations omitted ; see also wyers v. master_lock_co. 616_f.3d_1231 1248 fed.cir.2010 linn j. concurring
despite the district_courts detailed analysis we find that on the basis of the jurys factual_findings it erred by granting s & ns motion for jmol.10

while the supreme court made clear that a mechanical application of the teaching-suggestion-motivation test requiring an explicit teaching in the prior_art is inappropriate` [ w ] e must still be careful not to allow hindsight reconstruction of references to reach the claimed invention without any explanation as to how or why the references would be combined to produce the claimed invention'
innogenetics 512 f.3d at 1374_n._3

as noted above s & n never offered evidence articulating why a person having *1369 ordinary_skill in the art would combine the primary_references to obtain the disclosed inventions
although expert_testimony regarding motivation to combine is not always required the technology at issue here is not the type of technology where common sense would provide the motivation to combine these references
see master_lock_co. 616 f.3d at 1240_n._5` however as we [ have ] noted..expert_testimony regarding matters beyond the comprehension of laypersons is sometimes essential particularly in cases involving complex technology
in such cases expert_testimony may be critical for example to establish.. the existence or lack thereof of a motivation to combine references'
( internal_citations omitted

at a minimum creation of the claimed apparatus or method requires combining the zamierowski_references which disclose treating or healing of wounds with the chariker-jeter_publications that disclose a seal capable of maintaining negative_pressure
the record is devoid of any reason someone would combine these references however
indeed wake_forests experts testified that there was no reason to combine them
j.a
22865:15-66:17 ; j.a
22868:13-69:19 ; j.a
22870:22-71:12
in addition both of these references independently accomplish similar functions namely draining fluids
because each device independently operates effectively a person having ordinary_skill in the art who was merely seeking to create a better device to drain fluids from a wound would have no reason to combine the features of both devices into a single device
nor do the bagautdinov_references provide such motivation to combine the zamierowski_references and the chariker-jeter_publications to arrive at the method and apparatus claimed in the patents in suit
again the bagautdinov_references disclose only the draining of purulent_wounds ; it says nothing about treating wounds within the district_courts construction much less the healing of such_wounds with negative_pressure

as dr._argenta noted moreover if any of the doctors who created the devices disclosed in the prior_art thought that negative_pressure actually healed wounds they would have left the devices in place until the wounds were fully healed
j.a
22870
all of the doctors removed the devices after the wounds were drained but before healing with negative_pressure began
this indicates that the doctors were not using the disclosed devices and methods to heal wounds with negative_pressure because they did not believe that these devices were capable of such healing
in fact several of the primary_references disclosed methods that purposefully minimize granulization while the devices were in place because of the perceived dangers associated with negative_pressure
this amounts to significant evidence of teaching away
on the basis of this evidence hindsight provides the only discernable reason to combine the prior_art_references
unless one knew that negative_pressure could be used to treat wounds there would be no reason to combine the prior_art to arrive at the claimed device and methods

it is clear moreover that the district_court concluded that the invention was obvious because it believed the claims contained elements that were not new
this reasoning is incorrect` a patent composed of several elements is not proved obvious merely by demonstrating that each of its elements was independently known in the prior_art'
ksr 550 u.s. at 418 127_s.ct._1727
because none of the prior_art_references disclosed utilizing negative_pressure to heal wounds this is not even a *1370 case where the inventions at issue are merely composed of elements that were known in the art
indeed nearly seven years after the ¡¬081_patent was filed dr. attinger testified that he still did not believe the apparatus and method disclosed in the patents would work
j.a
22827:3-29:2

finally the significant objective_indicia of nonobviousness strongly weigh against a finding of obviousness
mintz 679 f.3d at 1378 evidence of objective_indicia of nonobviousness` may often establish that an invention appearing to have been obvious in light of the prior_art was not'

demaco corp. v. f. von langsdorff licensing ltd. 851_f.2d_1387 1391 fed.cir.1988
as discussed above the medical_community scoffed at this device when it was initially introduced
the industry was skeptical that the device worked even after reading studies that established that it did in fact work
j.a
21078:19-21079:5
after the system was disseminated moreover everyone began using it and the method and apparatus were copied
this evidence provides a key objective insight into how the medical_community viewed the patented_device

significantly this is not a case where the jury found the presence of only one or two objective_indicia of nonobviousness
nor is it a case where s & n seriously disputes those findings
rather the evidence strongly establishes the existence of nearly every objective_indicia of nonobviousness namely commercial_success long-felt need copying unexpected and superior_results wide_spread_acceptance in the field and initial_skepticism

we recently warned about the dangers of ignoring objective_indicia of nonobviousness in mintz where we said` [ s ] imply because the technology can be easily understood does not mean that it will satisfy the legal_standard of obviousness
in fact objective consideration of simple technology is often the most difficult because once the problem and solution appear together in the patent disclosure the advance seems self-evident'
679 f.3d at 1379
the objective_indicia of nonobviousness serve a particularly important role in a case like this one where there is a battle of scientific experts regarding the obviousness of the invention
in such a case the objective_indicia provide an unbiased indication *1371 regarding the credibility of that evidence

here the objective_evidence strongly supports the jurys findings under the first three graham_factors and cuts against the view that the claimed inventions were an obvious combination of known elements from the prior_art

on this record s & n has not proven by clear and convincing_evidence that the asserted_claims are obvious
the district_court committed error by failing to defer to the jurys factual_findings and granting jmol on obviousness
because the district_court concluded that the other issues raised in s & ns motion for jmol were moot in light of its decision to grant jmol on obviousness we reverse and remand so the district_court can consider those arguments in the first instance

conclusion
reversed and remanded

dyk circuit_judge concurring
i agree with the majority that deference is owed to the jurys implied findings in support of its nonobviousness_verdict for the reasons ably set forth in the majority_opinion
however i write separately because in my view the majority errs in its construction of the` healing' limitations of these claims
because the jury was not properly instructed on claim construction it is impossible to determine what findings the jury made
at the same time because the accused infringer did not seek a construction of the` healing' limitations we should assume the jury used the correct construction
under this construction there was not substantial_evidence that the claim limitations were absent from the prior_art though not in a single reference or that secondary considerations supported a finding of non-obviousness but there was substantial_evidence for the jury to have found insufficient motivation to combine
on this ground i agree with the majority that the accused infringer has not established invalidity for obviousness as a matter of law

i claim construction
as the majority describes the asserted_claims cover an apparatus and method for treating wounds by applying suction or` negative_pressure' and bagautdinov chariker-jeter and zamierowski are three groups of prior_art that disclose similar suction treatment systems
the jury found that none of the asserted_claims would have been obvious over this prior_art but the district_court granted judgment as a matter of law` jmol' that all of the asserted_claims were invalid for obviousness

see cybor corp. v. fas techs. inc. 138_f.3d_1448 1451 fed.cir.1998
the majority disregards this well established procedure by failing to directly address the proper_construction of the central claim limitations related to` healing'

the majority excuses its failure to do so on the ground that these claim_construction_issues` were neither raised nor discussed before the district_court and were not argued in this appeal'
maj. op.at 1346_n._1
i agree with the majority that the parties have failed to address the claim_construction_issues directly and have chosen instead to address the issues without the benefit of a proper claim construction
nonetheless defendant-appellee smith & nephew does contest the extent to which` healing' is required by the claims arguing that` wake_forest attempted to redefine its claimed invention throughout this litigation and continues to do so on appeal' by` mischaracterize [ ing ] the claims as requiringactive treatment ofclean wounds forextended periods of time in order to heal the wounds' even though` none of those limitations is in the claims'
def.-appellees br
41.1 and despite the parties failure to seek a proper_construction of the` healing' limitations it is simply not possible to meaningfully address the question of obviousness without construing these limitations either by making implicit assumptions about claim scope as the majority does or by explicitly construing the claims as i propose

the asserted_claims are claims 2_and_5 of u.s._patent_no._5645,081` the ¡¬ 081 patent' and claims 42 109 116 and 121 of u.s. patent no._7216,651` the ¡¬651_patent`
the ¡¬081 claims both require the apparatus to create negative_pressure` for facilitating the healing of wounds' 2 and to have a` sealing means.. for maintaining said negative_pressure'
¡¬081_patent_col. 9_ll._52 -58 emphases added
the asserted ¡¬651 method claims all require` maintaining` negative_pressure until the wound has` progressed toward a selected stage of healing'
¡¬651_patent col. 23_l._50 col. 25_ll._47 -48 emphases added
the district_court was not asked to construe` maintaining'` healing' or` a selected stage of healing' collectively` thehealing limitations' but it did rule that the claims do not have a minimum-time limitation a construction not challenged on appeal
j.a
13390
we are unable to determine whether the asserted_claims are obvious as a matter of law without understanding the meaning of these` healing' limitations
because these claim terms are central to these appeal our obligation to construe these limitations can not be avoided simply because the district_court failed to do so

in my view the` healing' limitations are properly construed as requiring only some progress toward healing-for example the formation of some new tissue or skin-and not complete_healing or wound_closure
the language of the` selected stage of healing' limitation itself clearly indicates that only some progress toward healing is required
additionally claim 20 of the ¡¬ 651 patent upon which claims 109 116 and 121 depend refers to` maintaining *1373 reduced_pressure to promote the formation of granulation_tissue' and claim 121 specifies that` the selected stage of healing comprises re-epithelialization of at least a portion of the wound'
¡¬651_patent col. 23_ll._48 -49 col. 30_ll._30 -31
the district_court construed` granulation_tissue' as` tissue formed during wound_healing' and` re-epithelialization' as` re-growth of skin'
j.a
10373 10377 emphases omitted
neither party objected to these constructions on appeal
these additional limitations in claims 20_and_121 demonstrate that` a selected stage of healing' can not refer to complete_healing
furthermore the unasserted dependent claims 118-big_token__120_and_122__big_token -124 of the ¡¬651_patent provide other more restrictive examples of` selected stage [ s ] of healing'` substantial closure of the wound'` substantially filling the wound with granulation_tissue'` migration of epithelial and subcutaneous_tissue toward the wound' and` a reduction in the volume [ diameter or depth ] of the wound by a predetermined amount'
under the` presumption that an independent claim should not be construed as requiring a limitation added by a dependent claim' curtiss-wright flow control corp. v. velan inc. 438_f.3d_1374 1380 fed.cir.2006` a selected stage of healing' is presumed to not include these limitations

there is also no indication in the specifications that` healing' or` selected stage of healing' refers to any particular stage of healing ; the ¡¬651_patent simply notes that` [ a ] n initial stage of wound_healing is characterized by the formation of granulation_tissue' and that` [ a ] selected state of improved condition may include' a number of conditions including any` stages of improvement or healing appropriate to a given type of wound or wound complex'
¡¬651_patent col. 1_ll._40 -41 col. 12_u._59 -66
the ¡¬ 081 patent does not define` facilitating.. healing' as used in the claim preambles but it notes that the invention may be used to` promote the migration of.. tissue'` reduce bacterial density in a wound' or` prevent [ ] the infection [ in a burn wound ] from becoming [ too ] severe'` facilitating..
healing'
¡¬081_patent_col. 1_ll._57 -58 col. 2_ll._1 -2 col. 3_l._67 -col. 4_l._13

although the majority_opinion does not explicitly construe the` healing' limitations it seems to make three assumptions as to the meaning of these limitations
first the majority suggests that the claims require application of negative_pressure for a particular extended length of time
for example the majority explains that bagautdinov did not sustain pressure` for a long_enough_period of time' and taught away from applying negative_pressure` for extended_periods' ; and that chariker-jeter taught` away from continued long-term_use of the device as directed by the ¡¬081 and ¡¬651_patent s.' maj. op.at 1362 1365
but as discussed above the district_court correctly determined that the claims do not have a minimum time limitation and that construction is not challenged on appeal

second to some extent the majority suggests that the claims require more than some progress toward healing such as complete_healing or closure
for example *1374 the majority states that` the invention appliesnegative_pressure.. for a time sufficient to facilitate closure of the wound` that bagautdinov was different from the claimed invention because it was not used` to treat wounds until closure' and that the asserted_claims` require wounds to be healed by negative_pressure'
maj. op.at 1346-47 1363 emphases added
to the extent the majority reads a requirement of complete closure into the claims this seems to me to be incorrect-as discussed above the` healing' limitations merely require some progress toward healing such as the formation of granulation_tissue or regrowth of skin

third the majority seems to suggest that the prior_art was different from the claimed invention because the purpose of the prior_art was drainage and cleaning rather than healing
the majority explains that bagautdinov was` for draining fluid' and was` discontinued when the purulent_wound has been cleaned' ; that zamierowski is` used to either drain from or inject fluid into the wound' and was not used` for wound_therapy' ; and that chariker-jeter was a` drainage_system' that was` discontinued when the fistula closed or substantial_drainage from the fistula stopped'
maj. op
1362 1364 1365
however the claims do not contain a purpose requirement-it is enough that healing is disclosed by the prior_art even if this was not the intention of the prior_art inventors
as the supreme court explained` [ i ] n determining whether the subject_matter of a patent claim is obvious neither the particular motivation nor the avowed purpose of the patentee controls
what matters is the objective reach of the claim
if the claim extends to what is obvious it is invalid under ¡± 103'
ksr int l co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 419 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007) ; see also nat l steel car ltd. v. canadian pac
ry. ltd. 357_f.3d_1319 1339 fed.cir.2004` a finding that two inventions were designed to resolve different problems.. is insufficient to demonstrate that one invention teaches away from another
`` ; in re beattie 974_f.2d_1309 1312 fed.cir.1992` [ t ] he law does not require that the references be combined for the reasons contemplated by the inventor`
it is irrelevant that the prior_art had the purpose of drainage as long as it used negative_pressure to heal wounds within the meaning of the claims

as discussed below the majoritys erroneous claim construction leads it to incorrectly conclude that the claim limitations are not found in the prior_art and that secondary considerations supported a finding of non-obviousness

ii limitations present in the prior_art
under the correct claim construction contrary to the majority the claim limitations are disclosed in the prior_art
because the jury received no instruction on the meaning of the` healing' limitations it is impossible to determine whether the jurys findings in support of its nonobviousness_verdict were based on the correct construction.4 however the party challenging validity smith & nephew did not seek a jury instruction on the` healing' limitations
`` [ l ] itigants waive their right to present new claim construction disputes if they are raised for the first time after trial'
cordis_corp. v. boston scientific corp. 561_f.3d_1319 1331 fed.cir.2009 *1375 quoting conoco inc. v. energy & envtl
int l l.c. 460_f.3d_1349 1359 fed.cir.2006
we therefore should assume that the jury used the correct claim construction

under the proper_construction the bagautdinov chariker-jeter and zamierowski groups of prior_art all meet the limitations of` maintaining' negative_pressure` for.. healing' or until a` selected stage of healing' because they explicitly disclose the re-growth of tissue and skin i.e. the formation of granulation_tissue and re-epithelialization
the bagautdinov method` accelerates.. sealing of purulent_wounds' and` the appearance of granulated tissue' was seen around the fourth or fifth day of vacuum treatment
j.a
10003 10027
one of the chariker-jeter_publications states that` an increased rate of granulation and re-epithelialization is seen with the closed suction wound drainage_system'
j.a
10051
and zamierowski states that it` promotes healing' and that` the present_invention is particularly well adapted for the.. regeneration of skin graft donor sites'
j.a
10063 10067.5 because each of these references applied negative_pressure for` healing' within the meaning of the claims it is irrelevant whether these references teach away from more prolonged application of negative_pressure
there is no substantial_evidence to the contrary
the majority errs in concluding that these claim limitations were not present in the prior_art

iii secondary considerations
the majority also errs in my view in finding that the jury could properly rely on secondary considerations to find the claims non-obvious
the failure to construe the` healing' limitations affects not only the prima facie case of obviousness but also the analysis of secondary considerations as we can not determine whether the jurys findings of secondary considerations were based on a proper understanding of claim scope
`` evidence of secondary considerations must be reasonably commensurate with the scope of the claims'
in re huai-hung kao 639_f.3d_1057 1068 fed.cir.2011
secondary considerations related to a patentees commercial product is not probative of nonobviousness if the asserted_claims are far broader than that commercial_embodiment
here as the majority notes there was substantial_evidence that the patentees product 1 was a commercial_success ; 2 was responsive to a long-felt need ; 3 was copied by others ; 4 had unexpected results ; 5 was accepted by others ; and 6 faced initial_skepticism
maj. op.at 1367
these secondary considerations however were related to the use of the commercial device utilizing the patent for extended_periods to close and completely heal wounds.6 this evidence would clearly be relevant if the patent claims were limited to complete_healing or wound_closure but as discussed above the *1376 claims require only some progress toward healing
there was no substantial_evidence that there were secondary considerations relevant to the invention as set forth in the claims as opposed to the far narrower commercial_embodiment

iv motivation to combine
as the majority describes there is however substantial_evidence that bagautdinov and chariker-jeter treat pus_pockets and fistulae respectively rather than` wounds' and that bagautdinov zamierowski and the chariker-jeter_public_use do not disclose an adequate seal
thus at the very least to find obviousness a person of ordinary_skill would have needed a motivation to combine the treatment of` wounds' by zamierowski with the seal from the chariker-jeter_publications
while motivation to combine may be addressed on summary judgment or jmol in appropriate circumstances see wyers v. master_lock_co. 616_f.3d_1231 1240 fed.cir.2010 it is still a question of fact and the accused infringers have failed to show that there was not substantial_evidence to support a finding of insufficient motivation to combine
in other_words under the assumption that the jury used the correct construction of the` healing' limitations there is substantial_evidence for the jury to have at least found the asserted_claims non-obvious due to insufficient motivation to combine
thus i agree with the majoritys ultimate_conclusion that the district_court erred in granting jmol of obviousness

goodwall does not address this issue however
instead it addresses whether a motion on an issue unresolved by the jury which utilized a rule 49 a special_verdict_form is a motion for judgment under rule 49 a or rule 50 b
991 f.2d at 756-57
we held that it was a motion under rule 49 a
id.at 757
6
to the extent s & n argues that kci waived its right to a jury_trial and agreed to use a rule 39 c 1 jury we find no merit in this argument
waiver of the right to a jury_trial can not be assumed under circumstances in which a party continually requests a jury_trial and the district_court never referenced rule 39 or waiver of the right to a jury_trial when it referred to an` advisory_jury'
see jennings v. mccormick 154_f.3d_542 545 5th cir.1998` the right to jury_trial is too important and the usual procedure for its waiver is too clearly set out by the civil rules for courts to find a knowing and voluntary relinquishment of the right in a doubtful situation'

while the district_court stated that the parties did not contest the content of the prior_art this statement was incorrect
jmol_order at 7
whether the prior_art disclosed the treatment of wounds with negative_pressure was a key dispute between the parties see id.at 21 and the district_court resolved the issue in its jmol order
id.at 25 27-28 33

while the district_court indicated in the jmol_order that it was not sure the claims contained this limitation as explained below they do
see infra p. 1363

this is the same conclusion we reached in blue_sky with respect to the chariker-jeter_references
554 f.3d at 1020` [ w ] e find that the testimony of kcis witnesses was sufficient to allow the jury to reach the conclusion that the chariker-jeter method was not used totreat a wound with negative_pressure as required by the claims`
on this point the evidence presented in this case by wake_forest and kci was just as strong as the evidence presented in blue_sky
we of course base our conclusion on the evidence in the current record
10
this conclusion is consistent with the ptos determination on reexamination that claims of the ¡¬651 and ¡¬081_patent s were patentable in the face of some references at issue here
while this determination is not binding on this court the jury was informed of the results of the reexamination and s & n does not dispute the admissibility of this evidence
1
smith & nephew also raises the argument that` there is a lack of substantial_evidence to support the jurys finding of nexus between the ¡¬ 081 claims and the secondary considerations'
id.at 66
2
the accused infringer appears to agree that this preamble language is a claim limitation
see def.-appellees br
62` the ¡¬081 claims merely require an apparatus that facilitates the healing of wounds`
3
while the patent does mention that the invention includes application of negative_pressure` for a time sufficient to facilitate closure of the wound' id
col. 2_ll._48 -49 it nowhere suggests that` healing' is synonymous with` closure' or that` facilitat [ ing ] closure' requires the application of negative_pressure until closure
as noted the patentee did not challenge the courts construction that there is no time limit in the claims
4
the jury did answer some specific questions in addition to giving a general_verdict of nonobviousness see j.a
65-70 but none of those specific questions is relevant to this issue
5
the majoritys suggestion that zamierowski` failed to disclose maintaining negative_pressure until the wound has progressed to a selected stage of healing' maj. op.at 1363 is thus incorrect ; the majority cites testimony that merely states that zamierowski does not discuss granulation_tissue formation
see j.a
22457:15-19 q
`` it follows from the fact that he does n't mention granulation that hes not stating that he promotes granulation_tissue growth ?'
a
`` well.. he does n't state my device promotes granulation_tissue
`` ; j.a
22669:5-8` [ h ] e really does not talk about the healing maintaining the pressure until the wound has progressed to the selected stage of healing
he does n't talk about granulation_tissue formation promotion of that`
6
for example dr._argenta an inventor on the patents testified that he was surprised when a patient with a serious wound` heal [ ed ] completely` after several months of treatment
j.a
20446:22 emphasis added
another expert testified that when a patient with an ulcer that would not heal was healed after eight weeks of treatment he was` stunned'` [ b ] ecause we had used the best techniques we knew to date to close this wound and none had worked and this technique which was counterintuitive worked'
