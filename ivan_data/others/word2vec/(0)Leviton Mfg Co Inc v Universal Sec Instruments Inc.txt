background
on october 22 2003 leviton filed u.s._patent_application_no._10 /690,776` germain_application' which claims priority to a february 3 2003 provisional application
greenberg_traurig attorneys paul sutton barry magidoff and claude_narcisse filed and prosecuted the germain_application
it lists franz germain and five others as co-inventors
each of these inventors submitted to the u.s._patent and trademark_office` pto' a sworn declaration that he was an original_inventor of the subject_matter which was claimed

six months later on april_19,_2004 leviton filed u.s._patent_application_no._10 /827,093 which later issued as u.s._patent_no._6864,766` the ¡¬766_patent`
the ¡¬766 is a third-generation continuation of u.s._patent_no._6246,558` the ¡¬558_patent`
the application for the ¡¬558_patent was filed on august 20 1999 and leviton has claimed that the ¡¬766_patent is entitled to this priority_date
nicholas disalvo and william_ziegler are named as the inventors of the ¡¬766_patent
both of these inventors also submitted to the pto a sworn declaration that he was an original_inventor of the subject_matter which was claimed

the ¡¬766_patent and the germain_application have no common inventors and neither claims priority to the other
the ¡¬766_patents claimed 1999 priority_date is three and a half_years before germains claimed 2003 priority_date
the ¡¬766_patent and germain have many claims that are nearly identical
for example the only difference between claim 1 of the ¡¬766_patent and claim 31 of the germain_application is that claim 1 recites` at least one moveable bridge' whereas claim 31 recites` a movable_bridge'
and dependent_claims 3 4 13_and_14 of the ¡¬766_patent are identical to germain claims 32 31 43_and_44

meihao and leviton offer different explanations as to the similarity of the claims
meihao contends that narcisse` copied' the claims from the germain_application into the application that matured into the ¡¬766_patent
leviton explains the similarity by stating that several months after narcisse filed the germain_application he met with several leviton engineers including william_ziegler one of the inventors of the ¡¬558_patent
at that meeting narcisse learned that the broad reverse-wiring protection concept he claimed in the germain_application had actually been described in the ¡¬558_patent over three years earlier having already been invented by ziegler and disalvo
afterwards narcisse prepared a continuation of the ¡¬558_patent with claims directed to that feature

during the prosecution of the ¡¬766_patent leviton did not disclose the germain_application or the fact that certain_claims had been copied from germain into the application for the ¡¬766_patent
moreover leviton did not inform the pto that it had previously submitted a sworn declaration in which other individuals the germain inventors claimed to be inventors of subject_matter very similar to that which was now recited in the application for the ¡¬ 766 patent

in june_3,_2005 two months after the ¡¬766_patent issued leviton disclosed the *1357 ¡¬766_patent the ¡¬558_patent and thirty other references during the prosecution of the germain_application
in september 2005 having learned of the substantively identical_claims the pto issued a double-patenting rejection of the germain_application in light of the ¡¬766_patent
leviton cancelled the similar_claims

a reexamination of the ¡¬766_patent was requested on june_6,_2005
leviton did not disclose the germain_application or the related_litigation to the pto during the seven months in which the examiner reconsidered the patentability of the ¡¬766_patent
on february 17 2006 the examiner confirmed all claims of the ¡¬766_patent and the reexamination requestor appealed
leviton filed its appeal brief on june_16,_2006 but did not disclose the germain_application or related_litigations to the pto though it had been aware of inequitable_conduct_allegations for over a year

narcisse first referenced the germain_application and asserted that it was not material_information in a memorandum to the pto dated august 7 2007
although narcisse titled his memorandum` information_disclosure_statement'` ids' it is not formally an ids because it does not meet any of the requirements for an ids
narcisse also submitted several standard pto forms titled` information_disclosure_statement by applicant' that comply with pto rules but these ids forms did not list the germain_application

during the district_court case meihao sought discovery of the facts related to the inequitable_conduct defense
meihao argued that levitons counsel unreasonably and self-servingly tried to avoid discovery of levitons own misconduct
when meihao issued subpoenas to sutton magidoff and narcisse the witnesses did not object did not produce documents and did not appear for their scheduled depositions
leviton belatedly moved to quash primarily on the ground that the witnesses were acting as levitons litigation counsel
in march 2007 greenberg_traurig withdrew and was replaced by nixon vanderhye

narcisse and magidoff subsequently appeared for depositions and levitons new counsel made numerous privileged advice and work_product_objections and repeatedly instructed the witnesses not to answer
during narcisses deposition counsel made 96 privileged advice and work_product_objections and over a third of the time explicitly instructed narcisse not to answer
many of these questions were about the relationship between the germain_application and claim 1 of the ¡¬766_patent or narcisses rationale for failing to disclose the germain_application to the pto
for example narcisse declined to answer the following questions claiming the work-product exception ¡E can you tell me with respect to claim 1 where you got the language for claim 1 ?
¡E so is n't it a fact that claim 1 of the ¡¬766_application was copied from claim 31 of the germain_application ?
¡E can you tell me where you got the phrase` move-able bridge' ?
¡E did you consider disclosing the germain_application to the pto ?
¡E how do you explain the similarity in claim_language ?
magidoff refused to answer similar questions also on advice and objection by counsel
the district_court found that these objections were baseless

another round of briefing ensued with meihao seeking an order compelling narcisse and magidoff to appear for further *1358 deposition and to fully answer meihaos questions and also compelling sutton to appear for deposition
the matter was argued and submitted to magistrate_judge_gauvey on september 17 2007
meihaos motions to compel were still pending when leviton moved to dismiss the case in november 2007 but the magistrate_judge noted that he was about to grant them

on november 28 2007 leviton moved to dismiss the case
leviton asserts that it dismissed the case because it succeeded in forcing meihao to stop selling older-model allegedly infringing products
meihao alleges the real reason leviton moved to dismiss its case was that it wanted to avoid a finding that the ¡¬766_patent is unenforceable
leviton has more than 30 different issued patents and patent_applications that relate to the ¡¬766_patent and levitons counsel of record on the ¡¬766_patent was also counsel of record in the pto on several hundred leviton patents
the district_court dismissed the case with prejudice on december 17 2007 and gave meihao leave to file a motion for fees and costs

the magistrate_judge held a hearing on the motion for fees and costs on september 3 2008 and issued a 128 page memorandum opinion on december 23 2008 in which she found that leviton had committed inequitable_conduct had engaged in a strategy of vexatious_litigation and that an award of fees to meihao was proper
district judge andre m. davis issued an opinion on may_12,_2009 accepting magistrate_judge_gauveys report and recommendations
the district_court entered two money judgments in favor of meihao together totaling $ 1,046,353.10 in costs and reasonable_attorney_fees

discussion
a
attorney fees
the patent act provides` the court in exceptional_cases may award reasonable_attorney_fees to the prevailing party'
35 u.s.c.¡± 285
`` the prevailing party may prove the existence of an exceptional_case by showing inequitable_conduct before the pto ; litigation_misconduct ; vexatious unjustified and otherwise bad faith litigation ; a frivolous suit or willful infringement'
epcon gas sys. inc. v. bauer compressors inc. 279_f.3d_1022 1034 fed.cir.2002
we review a district_courts finding that a case is` exceptional' within the meaning of ¡± 285 for clear_error
forest_labs. inc. v. abbott_labs. 339_f.3d_1324 1328 fed.cir.2003
once a case is determined to be exceptional we review the district_courts decision to award attorney_fees under an abuse of discretion standard
id

the district_court based its grant of attorney_fees on both 1 inequitable_conduct and 2 vexatious_litigation
leviton challenges each of these holdings as we discuss below

b
inequitable conduct
we review the district_courts decision to grant summary_judgment for inequitable_conduct de novo
see eisai co. v. dr. reddys labs. ltd. 533_f.3d_1353 1359 fed.cir.2008
summary judgment may only be granted where there are no genuine_issues of material_fact
anderson v. liberty lobby inc. 477_u.s._242 248 106_s.ct._2505 91_l.ed.2d_202_(1986)
to prevail on inequitable_conduct an accused infringer must show that the applicant` 1 made an affirmative_misrepresentation of material_fact failed to disclose material_information or submitted false_material_information and 2 intended to deceive the [ pto ]'

materiality
under our scattered precedents information may be considered material if *1359 there is a` substantial likelihood that a reasonable_examiner would consider it important in deciding whether to allow the application to issue as a patent'
perseptive biosystems inc. v. pharmacia_biotech inc. 225_f.3d_1315 1321 fed.cir.2000 ; see also digital_control inc. v. charles machine works 437_f.3d_1309 1314 fed.cir.2006 holding that omissions and misstatements are material if` a reasonable_examiner would have considered such [ information ] important in deciding whether to allow the.. application'
information concealed from the pto` may be material even though it would not invalidate the patent'
larson_mfg co. v. aluminart_prods ltd. 559_f.3d_1317 1327 fed.cir.2009 quoting li second family ltd. v. toshiba corp. 231_f.3d_1373 1380 fed.cir.2000
however` a withheld otherwise material reference is not material if it is merely cumulative to or less relevant than information already considered by the examiner'
larson 559 f.3d at 1327

a. germain_application
we agree with meihao and the district_court that levitons failure to disclose the germain_application was material
leviton argues that its failure to disclose germain was not material for any of the reasons cited by the district_court contending that 1 leviton did not` copy' claims under 37 c.f.r.¡± 10.23 c 7 ; 2 the disclosure of germain would not be material to inventorship ; 3 the disclosure of germain would not be material to double_patenting ; and 4 the disclosure of germain would not be material to written description
we consider each of these arguments below

leviton first challenges the district_court statement that` information oncopying of claims is essentially material per se under the pto regulations' citing 37 c.f.r.¡± 10.23 c 7 2004big_token__1_section_10__big_token23 c 7 requires identifying to the pto` a patent or patent_application of another from which one or more claims have been copied'
leviton alleges that ¡± 10.23 c 7s reference to` copying' is only directed to the interference_context because it refers to provisions that address a request for an interference
in this context narcisses interpretation` of another' meant another patent owner and not another inventive entity
leviton further argues the concept of` copying' is a term of art used exclusively in the interference_context

meihao responds that` copying' means` copying' and there is no language that limits it to the interference_context
moreover meihao responds that the rules do not apply solely to interferences involving different patent owners but also explicitly apply to interferences involving different patent_applicants
see 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.41 a` unless the contrary is indicated the wordapplicant when used in these sections refers to the inventor or joint inventors who are applying for a patent
``

we agree with leviton that ¡± 10.23 c 7 is primarily directed to the interference_context
section 10.23 c 7 specifically refers to ¡± 1.604 b and ¡± 1.604 7 c both of which address a request for an interference
leviton did not request declaration of an interference in this case
indeed an *1360 interference generally can not be declared between applications by a single party
thus we agree with leviton that ¡± 10.23 c 7s express prohibition on the` copying' of claims is not applicable to the instant situation

second leviton argues that the germain_application was not material to inventorship
leviton contends that if the ¡¬766 claims are supported by the common specification of the ¡¬766 and ¡¬558_patent s then germain and his coinventors could not have conceived the inventions in the ¡¬766 claims because those inventions were described several_years earlier in the ¡¬558_patent

meihao responds that a reasonable_examiner would want to know if two different_applications had two different_sets of inventors that both claimed to make the same_invention
meihao contends that an examiner would not automatically discount the germain_application in determining inventorship simply because it had a later priority_date because no person may patent an invention that` he did not himself invent'
35 u.s.c.¡± 102 f

we agree with meihao that the germain_application was material to inventorship
even if one application had an earlier_priority_date the examiner would have to evaluate which set of inventors actually conceived of the invention
see invitrogen corp. v. clontech labs. inc. 429_f.3d_1052 1063 fed.cir.2005 conception of an invention is the` formation in the mind of the inventor of a definite and permanent idea of the complete and operative invention as it is hereafter to be applied in practice
`` ; hitzeman v. rutter 243_f.3d_1345 1358-59 fed.cir.2001` [ a ] n inventor who failed to appreciate the claimed inventive features of a device at the time of alleged conception can not use his later recognition of those features to retroactively cure his imperfect conception`
it is not enough for leviton to claim that the earlier_specification does in fact support the claims
neither an inventor nor his counsel may graft claims onto an earlier_specification if those claims do not reflect what the inventor actually invented at the time of the earlier application

the copying of certain_claims from the germain_application with one set of named inventors into the ¡¬766_patent_application with another set of inventors suggests that the named inventors may not have in fact invented the claimed subject_matter
here leviton submitted patent_applications and sworn inventorship declarations from two different_sets of inventors both attesting that they were inventors of the claimed subject_matter
had the examiner been aware that different leviton employees each claimed to be first inventors of the same subject_matter recited in the same_claims it would have raised serious_questions regarding inventorship-an issue that is clearly material to patentability
moreover as we have acknowledged` whether the inventorship of the patents as issued is correct does not determine the materiality of the statements in this case just as whether concealed prior_art would actually invalidate the patent is irrelevant to materiality'
see perseptive 225 f.3d at 1322 ; larson 559 f.3d at 1327
even if the examiner might have ultimately concluded that disalvo and zeigler invented the claimed subject_matter the nearly identical_claims raise a substantial_inventorship_question that would have required additional_investigation by the examiner
thus we hold that levitons failure to disclose the germain_application during the prosecution of the ¡¬766_patent was material

third leviton argues that the district_court erred by considering the germain *1361 patent material to double_patenting
according to leviton the intent of the double-patenting rule is to allow the pto to prevent two patents from issuing at different times with the same_claims
leviton contends that narcisse gave the pto the information to evaluate the double-patenting issue during the prosecution of the later-priority but earlier-filed germain_application
moreover leviton contends that the pto could not use the germain_application to make a double-patenting rejection in the ¡¬766_patent_prosecution because the examiner would have allowed the earlier priority patent to issue if there were no other_rejections remaining

meihao responds that a reasonable_examiner would consider germain material to double_patenting
moreover meihao points out that under manual of patent_examining_procedure` mpep' section 804 the pto_examiner would first issue a provisional double_patenting_rejection to both the application for the ¡¬ 766 patent and the germain_application before withdrawing one of those rejections

we hold that the copying of claims would be material to the issue of double-patenting because a reasonable_examiner would want to consider both applications
although it is unlikely that the examiner would ultimately apply the double_patenting_rejection to the application with an earlier_priority_date the double_patenting issue would typically lead to an immediate provisional rejection as to each application
see mpep section 804
once all other_rejections are resolved the provisional rejection can be withdrawn to one application which will then issue as a patent
while the rejection may be withdrawn as to the application with the earlier filing date it is not required by the mpep guidelines
thus the pto could have rejected the ¡¬766_patent for double-patenting
accordingly we conclude that knowledge of the germain_application during the ¡¬766_patent_prosecution would be material

finally leviton argues that the disclosure of the germain_application during the ¡¬766 prosecution would not have affected the examiners conclusion that the claims were supported by the specification
leviton notes that the examiner stated in the context of the double-patenting issue that the ¡¬766_patent` disclose [ s ] everything claimed [ in germain ] except the use of a latched reset lockout with the interrupting device'
leviton argues that nobody has had trouble recognizing that the claimed` movable_bridge' is described in the ¡¬766 specification as the movable contact arms 50_and_70
leviton argues that the written description issue only concerns whether the description would allow persons of ordinary skill in the art to recognize that the inventor invented that which is claimed

meihao responds that this is improper` but for' argument of what the examiner would have done
meihao argues that in not disclosing germain leviton withheld the very reference that would have caused any reasonable_examiner to question the ¡¬766_patent_applications compliance with the statute

we agree with leviton that the germain_application is not material to the written description_requirement
pursuant to 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
1 the ¡¬766_patent_specification must support its claims
the germain_application does not affect whether the ¡¬766_patent_specification supports its claims and thus should not affect a reasonable_examiners assessment
nevertheless because a reasonable_examiner would want to consider the germain_application with respect to inventorship and *1362 double_patenting the district_court correctly concluded that the failure to disclose the germain_application during the ¡¬766_patent_prosecution was material

b
related_litigation
leviton also challenges the district_courts conclusion that levitons failure to disclose related_litigation during the prosecution of the ¡¬766_patent was material
meihao identified twelve cases filed before the ¡¬766_patent issued involving its parent_patents that meihao contends should have been disclosed during the prosecution of the ¡¬766_patent
leviton does not dispute that the parent_patents of the ¡¬766_patent were litigated in at least a dozen lawsuits filed before the ¡¬766_patent issued
leviton also does not dispute that it was aware of those cases as well as the allegations of invalidity and unenforceability made in many of them
leviton instead argues that the fact that leviton succeeded on the validity of those patents shows that those litigations were not material
we disagree
leviton violated the requirements of mpep_¡± 2001.06 c and this courts precedent by failing to bring these cases to the ptos attention
see nilssen v. osram_sylvania inc. 504_f.3d_1223 1224 fed.cir.2007 holding that the existence of earlier related_litigation itself was material_information
leviton should have disclosed the existence of the cases themselves and material_information from those cases not just invalidating prior_art
mpep_¡± 2006 c expressly notes that defenses raised against validity or charges of inequitable_conduct would be material to patent examination for example the defenses raised against validity of the patent or charges of` fraud' or` inequitable_conduct' in the litigation would normally be` material to the examination' of the reissue_application
it would in most situations be appropriate to bring such_defenses to the attention of the office by filing in the reissue_application a copy of the court papers raising such_defenses
at a minimum the applicant should call the attention of the office to the litigation the existence and the nature of any allegations relating to validity and/or` fraud' or` inequitable_conduct' relating to the original patent and the nature of litigation materials relating to these issues

thus leviton should have disclosed these litigations not merely ones where a patent was invalidated
the failure to disclose such litigations normally would be material and we conclude that they are material here

2
intent to deceive
we next consider whether leviton withheld the germain_application and related_litigation with an intent to deceive the pto
this court has held that the intent to deceive must be` viewed in light of all the evidence..
intent need not and can rarely be proven by direct_evidence
rather intent to deceive is generally inferred from the facts and circumstances surrounding the applicants overall conduct'
impax labs. inc. v. aventis pharmaceuticals inc. 468_f.3d_1366 1374-75 fed.cir.2006 ; see also cargill inc. v. canbra_foods ltd. 476_f.3d_1359 1364 fed.cir.2007` [ b ] ecause direct_evidence of deceptive_intent is rarely available such intent can be inferred from indirect and circumstantial_evidence`
even if the nondisclosed_information is of` relatively high_materiality' however inequitable_conduct can not be found where` [ the patentee ] offer [ s ] a plausible good_faith *1363 explanation for why [ the nondisclosed_information ] was not cited to the pto'
warner-lambert co. v. teva_pharms
usa inc. 418_f.3d_1326 1348 fed.cir.2005
moreover` [ a ] n accused infringer can not carry its threshold_burden simply by pointing to the absence of a credible_good_faith_explanation'
see larson_mfg co. v. aluminart_prods ltd. 559_f.3d_1317 1341 fed.cir.2009 citing star_scientific inc. v. r.j._reynolds_tobacco_co. 537_f.3d_1357 1368 fed.cir.2008
we rarely affirm a grant of summary_judgment of inequitable_conduct and in those cases where we have affirmed the applicants did something other than fail to disclose a commonly owned application or related_litigation
see e.g. paragon_podiatry lab inc. v. klm labs inc. 984_f.2d_1182_(fed.cir.1993) affirming inference of intent to deceive` not simply from the materiality of the affidavits but from the affirmative acts of submitting them their misleading character and the inability of the examiner to investigate the facts'

meihao argues that the district_court properly found that leviton intended to deceive the pto
meihao refers to a number of findings by the magistrate_judge that support its conclusion 1 narcisse failed to provide a credible_explanation for why he did not notify the pto about the` copying' of claim_language from the germain_application ; 2 leviton had a strong motive to deceive because moving the claims from the germain_application to the ¡¬766_patent would allow leviton to avoid several_years of potentially invalidating art ; 3 narcisses experience and knowledge meant that he should have known about his duty to disclose the germain_application ; and 4 there was no evidence of countervailing good_faith in levitons dealings with the pto

leviton counters that the magistrate_judge improperly inferred an intent to deceive
according to leviton at the minimum genuine_issues of material_fact preclude summary_judgment of inequitable_conduct
leviton argues that narcisse offered a reasonable explanation for why he did not inform the pto of the germain_application he did not believe that germain was prior_art because the priority_date of the ¡¬766_patent was at least three years before leviton filed the germain_application

we hold that there are genuine_issues of material_fact which preclude summary_judgment for inequitable_conduct and we remand for an evidentiary_hearing
the district_court inferred an intent to deceive based on narcisses failure to advise the pto of the germain_application and related_litigation which is an omission not an affirmative_misrepresentation
we have not previously affirmed a grant of summary_judgment based on a failure to disclose a commonly owned application or related_litigation and we decline to do so on the facts of this case
see e.g. paragon_podiatry 984_f.2d_1182
while a district_court may make inferences based on the evidence the district_courts inference was not the only reasonable one based on the record
see star_scientific 537 f.3d at 1366` further the inference must not only be based on sufficient_evidence and be reasonable in light of that evidence but it must also be the single most reasonable_inference able to be drawn from the evidence to meet the clear and convincing_standard`
during his deposition narcisse provided a plausible explanation for why he did not disclose the germain_application` [ b ] ecause the germain_application is not a prior_art_reference to the ¡¬766_application'
narcisse further explained` [ the germain_application ] *1364 was not material to the patentability of the ¡¬766_application.. [ i ] t was clear that the ¡¬766_application was prior_art.. to the germain
and so the germain was not prior_art to the ¡¬766 and therefore the germain_application did n't come into the picture at all'
while we conclude that narcisses failure to disclose the germain_application was material we can not agree that narcisses explanation of his thoughts at the time were unreasonable as a matter of law
see warner-lambert 418 f.3d at 1348
thus the district_court could not find narcisses explanation to be implausible without an evidentiary_hearing

meihao correctly points out that narcisse failed to provide any explanation at his deposition for why he did not disclose related_litigation
however the failure to provide an explanation is not independently dispositive of whether a patent_prosecutor intended to deceive the pto
see larson 559 f.3d at 1341
in addition narcisse later submitted a memorandum during ¡¬766 reexamination proceedings disclosing all of the related_litigations and he summarized the inequitable_conduct_allegations that had been made with respect to the germain_application
while this does not necessarily demonstrate good_faith it may be evidence of good_faith
the district_court could not find that leviton intended to deceive the pto by failing to notify the pto of related_litigations without an evidentiary_hearing i.e. as a matter of law

meihao also contends that leviton can not now argue that the magistrate_judge erred by not hearing live_testimony from narcisse because leviton never sought to present live_testimony
see e.g. paterson-leitch co. v. mass
mun
wholesale elec co. 840_f.2d_985 990-91 1st cir.1988 holding that` an unsuccessful party is not entitled as of right to de novo review.. of an argument never seasonably raised before the magistrate [ judge ]'
however in its opposition to meihaos motion for costs and attorney_fees before the magistrate_judge leviton specifically noted` [ t ] o rule on meihaos motion the court would need to reopen discovery and conduct a bench_trial on inequitable_conduct..' 2 leviton repeated this argument before the district_judge in objecting to the magistrate_judges report and recommendation and specifically complained about the lack of live_testimony
thus leviton is entitled to argue that it was denied an evidentiary_hearing

because we hold that genuine_issues of material_fact exist that preclude summary_judgment for inequitable_conduct we vacate the determination of the district_court and remand for a bench_trial

c. vexatious litigation
we also vacate and remand the district_courts decision and fee award with respect vexatious_litigation
we first note that the district_judge and magistrate_judge expressly acknowledged that an attorney_fees award on litigation_misconduct alone would justify only a smaller award and thus we must necessarily remand for a determination of fees
in addition the district_courts vexatious_litigation determination appeared to depend at least in part on the holding of inequitable_conduct which we vacated
for example the district_judge reasoned` the inference is inescapable that the misguided efforts by *1365 levitons counsel to resist discovery on inequitable_conduct arose in significant part because it was members of that firm that had engaged in such conduct'
this appears to tie the analysis of levitons discovery intent to the courts conclusion on inequitable_conduct
thus because we find that the inequitable_conduct holding must be vacated we must also vacate the vexatious_litigation_finding

in addition we are concerned with part of the district_courts analysis related to the work_product_doctrine
pursuant to rule 26 b 3` [ o ] rdinarily a party may not discover documents and tangible things that are prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial by another party or its representative..' fed
r. civ
proc
26 b 3
however this is a qualified immunity and such materials may be discovered if another party shows that it has` substantial_need for the materials to prepare its case and can not without undue_hardship obtain their substantial equivalent by other_means'
id
opinion work product generally remains immune from discovery unless the requesting party demonstrated` substantial_need' and` undue_hardship'
see hickman v. taylor 329_u.s._495 510 67_s.ct._385 91_l.ed._451_(1947)` not even the most liberal of discovery theories can justify unwarranted inquiries into the files and mental impressions of an attorney
`` ; upjohn co. v. united states 449_u.s._383 401-402 101_s.ct._677 66_l.ed.2d_584_(1981)` as rule 26 and hickman make clear such work product can not be disclosed simply on a showing of substantial_need.. [ a ] far stronger showing of necessity and unavailability by other_means would be required than is needed to justify ordinary work product`
as the magistrate_judge acknowledged exceptions to the work product privilege are` very rare' and exist only in` extraordinary_circumstances'
see chaudhry v. gallerizzo 174_f.3d_394 403 4th cir.1999 finding that appellant failed to present the` very rare and extraordinary situation justifying disclosure of opinion work product' ; in re allen 106_f.3d_582 607 4th cir.1997` [ o ] pinion work product enjoys a nearly absolute immunity and can be discovered only in very rare and extraordinary_circumstances`
here the magistrate_judge appears to have found that the work_product_doctrine would generally apply but that meihao satisfied the rare` substantial_need' and` undue_hardship' exceptions
while the magistrate_judge may have ultimately rejected levitons work product arguments based on these exceptions we are not convinced that levitons arguments were frivolous
leviton can not be required to concede that meihao satisfied the` substantial_need' and` undue_hardship' exceptions simply because a defense of inequitable_conduct was raised
moreover leviton could not possibly know in advance that the magistrate_judge was` mere days away' from releasing an opinion granting meihaos motion to compel
thus we conclude that the district_court clearly erred by finding that leviton engaged in vexatious_litigation by raising frivolous work-product objections

conclusion
for the reasons provided above the judgment of the district court is

vacated and remanded

prost circuit_judge dissenting
i respectfully dissent because the majority in my view overlooks the compelling facts presented in this case and suggests *1366 legal_standards contrary to our precedent
although i am cognizant of this courts rightful hesitance to allow a finding of inequitable_conduct on summary_judgment and agree with our precedent establishing that such a finding is reserved for a rare_case i firmly believe that this is that rare_case
see m. eagles tool warehouse inc. v. fisher tooling co. inc. 439_f.3d_1335 1339 fed.cir.2006 ; digital_control inc. v. charles mach

`` ; paragon_podiatry lab. inc. v. klm labs. inc. 984_f.2d_1182 1190 fed.cir.1993` while our precedent urges caution in the grant of summary_judgment respecting a defense of inequitable_conduct summary_judgment is not foreclosed
``

on the facts of this case i would uphold the district_courts finding of inequitable_conduct including its finding of deceptive_intent based on the conduct of one of leviton_manufacturing_company inc.s` levitons' patent_prosecutors claude_narcisse` narcisse'
narcisse a veteran_patent_prosecutor with twelve years of patent prosecution experience drafted claims for a patent_application u.s._patent_application_no._10 /690,776` the germain_application' and filed it with the u.s._patent and trademark_office` pto' on behalf of leviton
within six months he drafted almost indistinguishable_claims for a different patent_application u.s._patent_application_no._10 /827,093` the ¡¬766_patent_application' also owned by leviton
specifically two independent_claims and six dependent_claims in the ¡¬766_patent_application were word-for-word identical to those in the germain_application with the exception of one insignificant phrase
although the ¡¬766_patent_application claimed the same_invention as the germain_application narcisse attributed the ¡¬766_patent_application to a completely different_set of inventors
he proceeded to file the ¡¬766_patent_application with a priority_date three-and-a-half_years earlier than the germain_application expedite the prosecution of the ¡¬766_patent_application and prosecute the ¡¬766_patent_application through issuance as u.s._patent_no._6864,766` the ¡¬766_patent` without informing the pto about the co-pending germain_application
narcisse did not disclose the germain_application even though as he admitted in his deposition_testimony he alone drafted both sets of claims was aware of the near identicality of the claims in the two applications and was familiar with double-patenting rejections which inevitably arise when different_inventive_groups submit indistinguishable_claims in commonly-owned patent_applications
narcisses best explanation for his failure to inform the pto about the germain_application is that he did not think it was material because it was not prior_art
this purported justification is not only entirely incorrect but in my opinion and in that of the district_court incredulous given the many reasons the germain_application should have been disclosed including its obvious importance to inventorship and double-patenting issues

in addition to withholding the germain_application narcisse did not disclose that the parent_patents of the ¡¬766_patent were the subject of twelve litigations before the ¡¬766_patent issued` the related_litigation' eight of which had allegations of invalidity unenforceability or inequitable_conduct pending and unresolved during the prosecution of the ¡¬766_patent
at his deposition narcisse admitted that he knew about the related_litigation that he was aware that some of the litigations involved allegations *1367 of invalidity or unenforceability and that he was actually involved in three of the litigations before the ¡¬766_patent issued
he even admitted that at the time he prosecuted the ¡¬766_patent he was familiar with the specific manual of patent_examining_procedure` mpep' provision mpep_¡± 2001.06 c that mandates disclosure of litigation involving the subject_matter of a patent_application as well as allegations of inequitable_conduct arising in this litigation
nevertheless narcisse provided absolutely no explanation for failing to disclose the related_litigation
by admitting personal knowledge of the related_litigation and familiarity with the mpep_provision requiring its disclosure without providing any justification for withholding this information narcisse all but admitted that he withheld the related_litigation with intent to deceive

under these facts the district_court in my opinion properly found inequitable_conduct on summary_judgment
the majority holds that both the germain_application and the related_litigation were material to the prosecution of the ¡¬766_patent but concludes that the district_court could not infer deceptive_intent on summary_judgment
even under the de novo_standard of review applicable to summary_judgment,1 i disagree with the majoritys refusal to uphold the district_courts inference of intent to deceive
i would affirm the *1368 district_courts finding of intent because an inference of deceptive_intent is not merely the` single most reasonable_inference' star_scientific inc. v. r.j._reynolds_tobacco_co. 537_f.3d_1357 1366 fed.cir.2008 but the only_reasonable_inference permitted under the circumstances presented in this case

i part ways with the majority for a number of reasons
first in holding the germain_application to be merely` material' the majority appears to sidestep our precedent establishing that the germain_application was` highly material' to the prosecution of the ¡¬766_patent based on the possibility that its disclosure could result in a double-patenting rejection of the ¡¬766_patent
second with respect to deceptive_intent the majority seems to overlook narcisses most critical_admissions regarding his recognition of the materiality of the withheld information
specifically the majority is silent as to narcisses awareness that the pto could issue a double-patenting rejection in a situation like the one presented by the commonly-owned germain_application and ¡¬766_patent_application which claimed the identical invention to different_inventive_groups
the majority is also silent regarding narcisses admission that he was familiar with mpep_¡± 2001.06 c which unambiguously required him to disclose the related_litigation as well as the pending inequitable_conduct_allegations in this litigation to the pto

the majority compounds these case-specific problems by suggesting legal_standards for which i believe there is no basis in our precedent
in refusing to meaningfully assess the plausibility of narcisses purported_explanation for withholding the germain_application the majority diverges from our case_law establishing that implausible and specious justifications for withholding_material_information do not raise a genuine_issue of material_fact for summary_judgment_purposes
see majority_op.at 1363-64
further the majority suggests that the belated disclosure in re-examination proceedings of information withheld during the prosecution of a patent may establish good_faith sufficient to avoid a finding of deceptive_intent
id.at 1374
this representation contradicts our precedent which properly recognizes that a delayed disclosure is irrelevant to the inequitable_conduct inquiry an inquiry that focuses exclusively on the patentees intent during the initial_prosecution of the patent
quite simply the standards and reasoning put forward by the majority seem to create an insurmountable burden for an inference of deceptive_intent

i
analysis
a party asserting inequitable_conduct must prove that the patent_applicant` 1 made an affirmative_misrepresentation of material_fact failed to disclose material_information or submitted false_material_information and 2 intended to deceive the [ pto ]'
star_scientific 537 f.3d at 1365
both elements materiality and intent to deceive are questions of fact and at least a threshold_level of each must be proven by clear and convincing_evidence
see id
if the party asserting inequitable_conduct establishes threshold_levels of materiality and intent the court must then weigh the materiality and intent in light of all of the circumstances to determine whether the applicants conduct was egregious enough to warrant a finding of inequitable_conduct

in making this determination` [ t ] he more *1369 material the omission or misrepresentation the lower the level of intent.. required to establish inequitable_conduct'
star_scientific 537 f.3d at 1367

a
the germain_application
1
materiality
the majority` agree [ s ] with meihao and the district_court that.. the germain_application was material' specifically to inventorship and double-patenting in the prosecution of the ¡¬766_patent
majority_op.at 1358-59 1359-62
the district_court however found that the germain_application was not merely` material' but was` highly material' a significant distinction that the majority does not acknowledge.2 summary_judgment_order at 699-700
the district_court found the application` highly material' because 37 c.f.r.¡± 10.23 c 7 required its disclosure and it could have raised concerns regarding inventorship double-patenting and the written description_requirement
id.at 694-700
based on the germain_applications importance to inventorship and double-patenting issues i would uphold the district_courts` high_materiality' finding

as the district_court concluded the germain_application was` highly material' because it` could have conceivably served as the basis of a double_patenting_rejection' of the ¡¬766_patent
dayco prods. inc. v. total containment inc. 329_f.3d_1358 1365 fed.cir.2003 ; akron_polymer container corp. v. exxel container inc. 148_f.3d_1380 1382 fed.cir.1998
the majority properly recognizes that under mpep_¡± 804 disclosure of the co-pending commonly-owned germain_application with nearly identical_claims to the earlier-priority_¡¬766_patent_application would have led to` an immediate provisional [ double-patenting ] rejection' of each application
see mpep_¡± 804 ; majority_op.at 1361 emphasis added
furthermore the pto_examiner would not have been required to withdraw the rejection as to the earlier-priority_¡¬766_patent_application allowing the ¡¬766_patent to issue as opposed to the germain_application
see mpep_¡± 804 ; majority_op.at 1361
instead` the pto could have rejected the ¡¬766_patent for double-patenting'
majority_op.at 1361 ; see dayco prods. 329 f.3d at 1365 ; akron_polymer 148 f.3d at 1382

under our precedent in akron_polymer and dayco products which the majority does not mention or distinguish this potential for a double-patenting rejection is sufficient to make the germain_application` highly material'
in both cases we concluded that a withheld later-priority_application was` highly material' to an earlier-priority_application claiming similar subject_matter because` it could have conceivably served as the basis for a double_patenting_rejection'
dayco prods. 329 f.3d at 1365 ; akron_polymer 148 f.3d at 1382

further under the` reasonable_examiner' standard our main standard for materiality` information is material when a reasonable_examiner would consider it important in deciding whether to allow the application to issue as a patent'
star *1370 scientific 537 f.3d at 1367
applying this standard the germain_applications importance to double-patenting would have made it critical to any examiners evaluation of the ¡¬766_patent
accordingly i would uphold the district_courts determination that based on its importance to double-patenting concerns the germain_application was` highly material'

in addition the germain_application was` highly material' to inventorship_issues in the prosecution of the ¡¬766_patent
`` as a critical requirement for obtaining a patent inventorship is material'
perseptive biosystems inc. v. pharmacia_biotech inc. 225_f.3d_1315 1321 fed.cir.2000
where information is relevant to inventorship` whether the inventorship of the patents as issued is correct does not determine the materiality of the [ information ]'
id.at 1322
as such regardless of whether the inventorship of the ¡¬766_patent is correct the withheld germain_application was` highly material'
a` reasonable_examiner' evaluating the ¡¬766_patent_application would have found the co-pending germain_application which had several nearly identical_claims attributed to an entirely different_set of inventors critical in evaluating patentability
the germain_application would have raised serious concerns regarding whether the asserted inventors actually conceived of the invention claimed in the ¡¬766_patent
without the germain_application however the examiner had no reason to question the asserted inventorship
although the majority properly recognizes that disclosure of the germain_application would have raised` serious_questions regarding inventorship' and` a substantial_inventorship_question that would have required additional_investigation by the examiner' the majority nonetheless holds that the germain_application was only` material'
majority_op.at 1360
in my opinion given how critical the germain_application would have been to triggering these significant inventorship concerns it was` highly material' to inventorship

thus in light of the importance of the germain_application to inventorship and double-patenting issues in the prosecution of the ¡¬766_patent i would affirm the district_courts finding that the germain_application was` highly material'

2
intent
because` direct_evidence of deceptive_intent is rarely available' star_scientific 537 f.3d at 1366 intent to deceive must generally be inferred from circumstantial_evidence m. eagles 439 f.3d at 1341
in other_words`smoking gun evidence is not required.. to establish an intent to deceive'
paragon_podiatry 984 f.2d at 1189
nevertheless the evidence establishing intent` must still be clear and convincing and inferences drawn from lesser evidence can not satisfy the deceptive_intent requirement'
star_scientific 537 f.3d at 1366
even gross negligence is not sufficient
kingsdown med consultants ltd. v. hollister inc. 863_f.2d_867 876 fed.cir.1988

rather to justify an inference of deceptive_intent` the involved conduct viewed in light of all the evidence including evidence indicative of good_faith must indicate sufficient_culpability to require a finding of intent to deceive'
astrazeneca pharms
lp v. teva_pharms
usa inc. 583_f.3d_766 776 fed.cir.2009
the inference of deceptive_intent` must not only be based on sufficient_evidence and be reasonable in light of that evidence but it must also be the single most reasonable_inference able to be drawn from the evidence *1371 to meet the clear and convincing_standard'
larson_mfg co. of s. dakota inc. v. aluminart_prods ltd. 559_f.3d_1317 1340 fed.cir.2009 ; star_scientific 537 f.3d at 1366

because an inference of deceptive_intent is the only_reasonable_inference to be drawn from the facts surrounding narcisses withholding of the germain_application i disagree with the majoritys refusal to uphold the district_courts finding of intent
at the time he prosecuted the ¡¬766_patent narcisse was a seasoned patent attorney having practiced as a patent_prosecutor for approximately twelve years
see j.a.1972-76 ; see also molins_plc v. textron inc. 48_f.3d_1172 1181 fed.cir.1995 upholding finding of inequitable_conduct where the district_court considered the experience of the patent_prosecutor
not surprisingly narcisse admitted in his deposition_testimony that when he prosecuted the ¡¬766_patent he was aware of his duty of disclosure and his understanding that` in cases which are not entirely clear it is better to disclose the information to the [ pto ] and let the [ pto ] decide what is material'
j.a.2014
more specific to the germain_application narcisse acknowledged that he was familiar with the possibility of double-patenting rejections in situations like the one presented in this case where commonly-owned applications with different_inventive_groups claim the same_invention
j.a.1991` q.. [ i ] f two different_inventive_groups tried to submit the same claim in two different_applications but both were owned by leviton that could give rise to a double_patenting_rejection ; is that right ?
... a
yes
q
and you were aware of that when the ¡¬766_patent was prosecuted ?
a
yes
``

narcisse alone drafted the claims in both the germain_application and the ¡¬766_patent_application in the course of just six months
j.a.1983-84 2001
therefore he admittedly knew not only that both co-pending applications existed but also that they had what he described as` very similar' claims
j.a.1998 2021
despite his intimate knowledge of the germain_application and his familiarity with double-patenting rejections narcisse did not disclose the germain_application to the pto
j.a.1998

the district_court properly noted that leviton had a motive to conceal the germain_application with a priority_date three-and-a-half_years later than the ¡¬766_patent during the prosecution of the ¡¬766_patent
see summary_judgment_order at 710
the ptos awareness of the germain_application at a minimum would have delayed the expedited prosecution of the ¡¬766_patent_application arising out of the petition to make special
at worst the germain_application could have prevented the ¡¬766_patent from issuing
further with such an earlier_priority_date the ¡¬766_patent avoided a significant amount of prior_art including the allegedly infringing product in this case which was manufactured after the priority_date of the ¡¬766_patent but before the priority_date of the germain_application
see id

it seems to me that the circumstances surrounding levitons withholding of the germain_application are as egregious as possible short of an explicit admission of intent to deceive the pto
an experienced_patent_prosecutor drafted the claims for two co-pending applications listing entirely different inventors within months of one another and thus was intimately familiar with their nearly indistinguishable_claims
he was also admittedly aware of his duty of disclosure and the potential for a double-patenting rejection in this situation *1372 yet did not disclose the germain_application
in my view these facts undoubtedly` indicate sufficient_culpability to require a finding of intent to deceive'
kingsdown 863 f.2d at 876
as such i believe meihao met its burden to prove a threshold_level of intent to deceive by clear and convincing_evidence

given that meihao met its threshold_burden to prove intent the district_court correctly considered levitons purported good_faith_explanation for withholding the germain_application
`` the patentee need not offer any good_faith_explanation unless the [ party asserting inequitable_conduct ] first carries [ its ] burden to prove a threshold_level of intent to deceive by clear and convincing_evidence'
star_scientific 537 f.3d at 1368
once the party asserting inequitable_conduct meets its threshold_burden however it is` incumbent upon the patentee to rebut the evidence of deceptive_intent with a good_faith_explanation for the alleged misconduct'
id

throughout narcisses deposition he refused to answer many questions about the prosecution of the ¡¬766_patent and his withholding of the germain_application
nevertheless narcisse did put forward two explanations for his failure to disclose the germain_application
first narcisse asserted that he did not disclose the germain_application because it was not prior_art
second narcisse claimed that he did not believe that 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.604 b required disclosure of the germain_application

in considering a patentees good_faith_explanation for withholding information from the pto` merely conclusory statements or completely insupportable specious or conflicting explanations or excuses' do not raise a genuine_issue of material_fact for summary_judgment_purposes
digital_control 437 f.3d at 1314 emphasis added ; paragon_podiatry 984 f.2d at 1190 emphasis added ; see ferring 437 f.3d at 1193
in other_words to create a genuine_issue of material_fact the patentee must put forward a` plausible justification or excuse'
digital_control 437 f.3d at 1314 emphasis added ; paragon_podiatry 984 f.2d at 1191 emphasis added
levitons contention at oral_argument that` for summary_judgment_purposes [ the district_court ] need [ ed ] to take [ narcisse ] at his word [ ; ].. whether its a credible_explanation or not its his explanation' oral_arg.at 19:45-20:01 available at http //oralarguments.cafc.uscourts.gov/mp3/2009-1421.mp3 squarely contradicts this precedent and is therefore wrong as a matter of law
in my opinion the district_court properly rejected narcisses justifications as` implausible' and therefore insufficient to raise a genuine_issue of material_fact
see summary_judgment_order at 710

first narcisse claimed that he did not disclose the germain_application as a result of his belief that the germain_application was not material because it` [ wa ] s not a prior_art_reference to the ¡¬766 [ patent ] application'
j.a.1998-99 2001 2021-22 ; see oral_arg.at 7:24-29 19:15-22 22:25-33` [ narcisses ] testimony is that he did not believe [ the germain_application ] was material because.. it was not prior_art..' 60:24-59

our precedent makes clear that` [ m ] ateriality is not limited to prior_art but [ instead ] embraces any information that a reasonable_examiner would be substantially likely to consider important in deciding whether to allow an application to issue as a patent'
liquid dynamics corp. v. vaughan co. 449_f.3d_1209 1226 fed.cir.2006 emphasis added ; bristol- *1373 myers_squibb_co. v. rhone-poulenc rorer inc. 326_f.3d_1226 1234 fed.cir.2003 ; gfi inc. v. franklin corp. 265_f.3d_1268 1274 fed.cir.2001 ; see critikon 120 f.3d at 1258
thus it is indisputable that narcisses supposed reasoning is entirely incorrect

more importantly the district_court correctly rejected narcisses explanation as implausible
it is implausible that narcisse a veteran_patent_prosecutor and a member of the patent_bar for more than a decade believed that the only material_information that must be brought to the ptos attention is prior_art
this purported justification ignores the broad spectrum of information with which narcisse was admittedly familiar that the mpep and the code of federal regulations require to be disclosed
the most basic patent law treatises in addition to our case_law explain that materiality is not limited to prior_art
see e.g. 4a-15 donald_s._chisum chisum on patents ¡± 15.04 2010` a patent_applicants duty to disclose is not limited to disclosing prior_art
a patent_applicant must disclose any material_information to the pto
`` ; robert a. matthews jr. annotated patent digest ¡± 27:47 2010` just because information may not qualify as prior_art does not necessarily mean it is notmaterial
`` ; see also 3-7 donald_s._chisum chisum on patents ¡± 7.05 ; 4-11 id.¡± 11.03

the patent_bar an examination narcisse passed approximately ten years before prosecuting the ¡¬766_patent requires familiarity with the mpep which obligates patent_applicants to disclose to the pto information other than prior_art
j.a.1976` i became very familiar with the mpep 37 cfr and old or previous patent_bar exams`
in fact narcisse admitted his awareness of mpep_provisions that require the disclosure of information that is obviously not prior_art such as mpep_¡± 2001.06 c which provides where the subject_matter for which a patent is being sought is or has been involved in litigation the existence of such litigation and any other_material_information arising therefrom must be brought to the attention of the [ pto ]
examples of such_material_information include evidence of possible prior public use or sales questions of inventor-ship prior_art allegations offraudinequitable_conduct andviolation of duty of disclosure
another example of such_material_information is any assertion that is made during litigation which is contradictory to assertions made to the examiner
mpep_¡± 2001.06 c emphases added ; j.a.2008` q
could you look at 2001.06 c..
were you aware of that rule or provision at the time you prosecuted the ¡¬766 [ p ] atent [ a ] pplication ?
a
yes i was`
not only does this provision require disclosure of` the existence of.. litigation' involving the subject_matter of a patent_application information that clearly falls outside the realm of prior_art but also the listed examples of material_information show that materiality is not limited to prior_art
rather prior_art is but one example in the list of` examples of such_material_information'
see mpep_¡± 2001.06 c
narcisses rationale for failing to disclose the germain_application is thus inconsistent with mpep_provisions that he admits he was familiar with at the time he prosecuted the ¡¬766_patent
this specific inconsistency together with the fact that it is inconceivable that a patent_prosecutor with more than a decade of experience would equate materiality solely with prior_art leads me to firmly agree with the district *1374 courts conclusion that narcisses purported justification is entirely implausible and insufficient to create a genuine_issue of material_fact
in my view in light of our case_law holding that specious and implausible explanations for withholding_material_information do not raise a genuine_issue of material_fact there is no basis in our precedent for the majoritys refusal to allow the district_court to reject narcisses explanation as` unreasonable' and` implausible' and therefore insufficient to create a genuine_issue of material_fact on summary_judgment
see majority_op.at 1363-64

narcisses second explanation for his failure to disclose the germain_application is based on a technical reading of the language` of another' in 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.604 b
37 c.f.r.¡± 1.604 b provides that` [ w ] hen an applicant presents a claim known to the applicant to define the same patentable invention claimed in a pending application of another the applicant shall identify that pending application..' 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.604 b emphasis added
in his deposition_testimony narcisse admitted that he was familiar with the provision at the time he prosecuted the ¡¬766_patent but claimed that he` did n't think'` d [ id ] n't know' and was` not sure' whether the provision would have applied to applications` owned by the same entity'
j.a.2013-14
yet he never discussed his understanding of the provision with anyone
j.a.2014
even if as the majority holds narcisse was correct that 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.604 b did not mandate disclosure of the germain_application this is a technical argument about a specific disclosure provision
see majority_op.at 1359-60
this purported_explanation does not affect the other obvious reasons why the germain_application should have been disclosed to the pto during the prosecution of the ¡¬766_patent

as previously discussed the germain_application would have been critical to the prosecution of the ¡¬766_patent raising substantial inventorship and double-patenting issues
any patent practitioner never mind one with narcisses level of experience would realize that the co-pending germain_application and the ¡¬766_patent_application claiming the same_invention but attributing it to different people could not both issue as patents
it is obvious that the pto would want to be made aware of the co-pending applications to investigate inventorship_issues and avoid double-patenting
narcisse did not provide any rationale for believing these concerns to be inapplicable to his prosecution of the ¡¬766_patent
instead he admitted that he was aware that the situation that the commonly-owned germain_application and ¡¬766_patent_application presented` could give rise to a double [ - ] patenting rejection'
j.a.1991

levitons proposed inference that narcisse did not disclose the germain_application because he did not believe it was material prior_art and did not think 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.604 b required its disclosure is simply unreasonable
instead given the obvious reasons the application would have been highly important to the prosecution of the ¡¬766_patent as well as narcisses awareness of the substantially similar_claims and that such a situation could lead to a double-patenting rejection the overwhelming circumstantial_evidence suggests that narcisse purposefully withheld the germain_application
in light of these glaring facts an inference of deceptive_intent is the only_reasonable_inference to be drawn from narcisses withholding of the germain_application
see star_scientific 537 f.3d at 1366
i would therefore uphold the district_courts inference of deceptive_intent on summary_judgment.3

*1375 b
related_litigation
it is undisputed that the parent_patents of the ¡¬766_patent were involved in twelve litigations before the ¡¬766_patent issued and that leviton did not disclose any of these litigations to the pto during the prosecution of the ¡¬ 766 patent
a review of the district_court docket for each litigation shows that of these twelve litigations six were filed and four had been pending for almost a year before leviton filed the ¡¬766_patent_application
eight of these litigations had allegations of invalidity unenforceability or inequitable_conduct pending before leviton applied for the ¡¬766_patent four of which involved such allegations for more than eight months before prosecution began

1
materiality
like the majority i would uphold the district_courts finding that the withheld related_litigation was material
see majority_op.at 1362-63 ; summary_judgment_order at 701
as the majority recognized mpep_¡± 2001.06 c explicitly requires the disclosure of the` existence of.. litigation' involving` the subject_matter for which a patent is being sought' as well as` any other_material_information arising' from the litigation including` allegations offraudinequitable_conduct andviolation of duty of disclosure
`` mpep_¡± 2001.06 c
we have held that` [ i ] t is clear from the language of ¡± 2001.06 c that the existence of the litigation itself is material_information that an examiner needs to have
it is important because it signals the examiner that other_material_information relevant to patentability may become available through the litigation proceedings'
nilssen v. osram_sylvania inc. 504_f.3d_1223 1234 fed.cir.2007
thus the existence of the related_litigation as well as the pending allegations of inequitable_conduct and unenforceability was material_information that leviton had a duty to disclose
that leviton ultimately avoided a finding of invalidity or unenforceability in these litigations is irrelevant to whether a reasonable_examiner at the time the ¡¬766_patent was being prosecuted would have found the pending litigations and their inequitable_conduct_allegations important in assessing patentability

2
intent
as with the germain_application i disagree with the majoritys conclusion that the district_court could not infer on summary_judgment that narcisse withheld information about the related_litigation with deceptive_intent
see majority_op.at 1363-64
in light of narcisses critical_admissions during his deposition there is simply no other inference to be drawn from the evidence

*1376 first narcisse admitted that he was aware of the pending related_litigation and that he knew some of these litigations raised allegations of invalidity and unenforceability
j.a.2008-10
he further acknowledged that he was actively involved in three of these litigations before the ¡¬766_patent issued
j.a.2008-10 2020-21
as such there is no question that narcisse knew of the related_litigation

narcisse also admitted that he was familiar with the mpep_provision that mandates disclosure of the related_litigation
specifically narcisse acknowledged his awareness of mpep_¡± 2001.06 c which requires disclosure of the` existence of.. litigation' involving the subject_matter of a patent_application and any allegations of inequitable_conduct in these litigations
mpep_¡± 2001.06 c ; j.a.2008` q
could you look at 2001.06 c..
were you aware of that rule or provision at the time you prosecuted the ¡¬766 [ p ] atent [ a ] pplication ?
a
yes i was
q
and you were aware that this was part of your duty of disclosure ?
a
yes`
narcisse also admitted that he understood that this provision was part of his` duty of disclosure'
j.a.2008
notably the majority_opinion nowhere references this significant admission.4

narcisse further admitted that he did not disclose the existence of the related_litigation
j.a.2010
narcisses admissions as to his knowledge of the related_litigation and of his duty yet failure to disclose the information are more than sufficient for meihao to meet its threshold_burden to show deceptive_intent

leviton has never attempted to rebut this showing by providing a justification for narcisses failure to disclose the related_litigation during the prosecution of the ¡¬766_patent
the majority recognizes narcisses` fail [ ure ] to provide any explanation at his deposition for why he did not disclose [ the ] related_litigation' but goes on to cite larson_manufacturing for the proposition that` the failure to provide an explanation is not independently dispositive of whether a patent_prosecutor intended to deceive the pto'
majority_op.at 1364
larson_manufacturing however states only the familiar rule that` an accused infringer can not carry its threshold_burden simply by pointing to the absence of a credible_good_faith_explanation'
559 f.3d at 1341
in other_words` the patentee is not required to offer evidence of good_faith unless the accused infringer first meets its burden to prove-by clear and convincing_evidence-the threshold_level of deceptive_intent'
id
meihao does not rely on narcisses failure to provide a good_faith_explanation in order to meet its threshold_burden to establish deceptive_intent
narcisses many critical_admissions regarding his withholding of the related_litigation despite knowing of the information and his duty to disclose it are more than sufficient to pass this threshold
once meihao satisfied this burden it became` incumbent upon [ leviton ] to rebut the evidence of deceptive_intent with a good_faith_explanation for the alleged misconduct'
star_scientific 537 f.3d at 1368
yet narcisse has put forward no such explanation
the fact that narcisse has provided *1377 no excuse for his actions is not as the majority implies meihaos only evidence of intent
rather narcisses failure to provide a good_faith_explanation serves only to prevent leviton from rebutting meihaos strong showing of intent to deceive

the majority proceeds to reason that narcisses belated disclosure of the related_litigation in reexamination proceedings more than two years after the ¡¬766_patent had issued and meihao had raised the inequitable_conduct_allegations in this case` may be evidence of good_faith'
majority_op.at 1364
this proposition for which the majority provides no citation conflicts with our precedent
we have held that a patentees disclosure of withheld information in re-examination and re-issuance proceedings is` irrelevant' to whether the patentee committed inequitable_conduct in acquiring the patent an inquiry that centers on the patentees` intent during the prosecution of the original application'
bristol-myers_squibb_co. 326 f.3d at 1241 ; see molins_plc 48 f.3d at 1182` we recognize that [ the withheld references ] were cited eventually to the pto and that the examiner.. passed the reexamination application to issue thereafter
however the references were not cited when they should have been`
thus the majoritys suggestion that leviton may be able to establish good_faith in the prosecution of the ¡¬766_patent by its disclosure of the related_litigation years after the patent issued where narcisse knew of the related_litigation and his duty to disclose it at the time of the initial_prosecution is in my view contrary to our precedent

in sum narcisse all but admitted that he withheld the related_litigation with deceptive_intent
if we do not accept that an inference of deceptive_intent is the` single most reasonable_inference' star_scientific 537 f.3d at 1366 where a patent_prosecutor provides absolutely no explanation good_faith or otherwise for his conduct and admits 1 that he knew of and had personal involvement with the withheld material_information ; 2 that he was familiar with specific mpep_provision that by its express unambiguous terms mandates disclosure of the information ; 3 that he understood this provision to be part of his duty of disclosure to the pto ; and 4 that he still did not disclose the information then i fail to see when an inference of intent on summary_judgment will ever be permissible
the only_reasonable_inference to be drawn from narcisses unexplained failure to disclose the related_litigation despite his admitted knowledge of the pending related_litigation and the mpep_provision that requires its disclosure is that he deliberately withheld information about the litigations from the pto
therefore i would uphold the district_courts inference of deceptive_intent

c. lack of an evidentiary hearing
leviton argues that the district_court should have held an evidentiary_hearing where narcisse could fully explain his conduct and the court could assess his credibility
accepting the majoritys premise that this was a summary_judgment_motion see supra n. 1 leviton had` ample opportunity' to create a genuine_issue of material_fact to avoid summary_judgment
paragon_podiatry 984 f.2d at 1192
yet leviton failed to do so

throughout narcisses deposition he was repeatedly asked about his rationale for withholding both the germain_application and the related_litigation but refused to answer numerous questions on these topics
nevertheless when meihao filed a *1378 motion for summary_judgment leviton chose not to submit an affidavit from narcisse to further explain his decisions to withhold this information
at the oral hearing on meihaos summary_judgment_motion the district_court accepted new evidence from leviton but leviton still did not attempt to supplement the record with oral testimony or affidavits from narcisse or any other witness

`` on summary_judgment in order to create a genuine_issue [ leviton ] bore the burden of submitting an affidavit from [ narcisse ] to contradict [ meihaos ] evidence of intent if [ it ] believed that testimony from [ narcisse ] would establish credible evidence for the withholding'
ferring 437 f.3d at 1192
at oral_argument leviton represented that it did not submit any additional_evidence because it thought it would win on summary_judgment
oral_arg.at 4:14-5:26
this however was a strategic decision for which leviton must suffer the consequences
moreover leviton has not indicated or even suggested that there is additional_evidence or explanation that might change the result
see paragon_podiatry 984 f.2d at 1192
it merely argues that on the record before the court it should have survived summary_judgment
because leviton failed to put forward evidence raising a genuine_issue of material_fact ferring 437 f.3d at 1193 leviton was not entitled to avoid summary_judgment and thus have an evidentiary_hearing
accordingly the district_court properly granted summary_judgment of inequitable_conduct against leviton

ii
conclusion
as the district_court recognized levitons arguments` comprise in the main a jumble of miscitations to legal_standards ; blatant ignoring of other controlling standards ; reliance on arguments that are.. utterly irrelevant to the issues presented ; and a veritable sea of red herrings'
summary_judgment_order at 679
by accepting many of these arguments the majority_opinion arguably creates troubling new standards for intent to deceive
the majority overlooks the disturbing facts of this case in which an experienced_patent_prosecutor withheld critical information with which he was intimately familiar despite his awareness of reasons that the pto would want to be made aware of the information and lack of a credible reason for the omissions
in overturning the district_courts finding of deceptive_intent on these facts the majoritys legal_standards and reasoning take the burden to establish deceptive_intent to an unprecedented level
i can not agree with the majoritys analysis and would affirm the district_courts inequitable_conduct_determination including its finding of deceptive_intent

leviton suggests that the district_court found that meihao committed inequitable_conduct per se based on` copying' the claims
this is incorrect
the district_court concluded that the copying of claims is` essentially material per se` but not inequitable_conduct per se
2
leviton argued that such a bench_trial while necessary to resolve the inequitable_conduct issue would be unjustified because the case was closed and for other reasons stated in the opposition

i would review the district_courts grounds for its` exceptional' case finding both inequitable_conduct and vexatious_litigation under the standard of review applicable to an` exceptional_case' finding under 35 u.s.c.¡± 285 rather than the de novo_standard applicable to summary_judgment

here the district_court determined inequitable_conduct as well as vexatious_litigation as grounds for finding the case` exceptional' in the context of shanghai meihao electric inc.s` meihaos' motion for attorney_fees

yet the majority characterizes the district_courts inequitable_conduct_determination as a summary_judgment and reviews this determination de novo
majority_op.at 1358 1364
the majority proceeds to review the vexatious_litigation_finding the other grounds for the` exceptional_case' finding for` clear_error'
id.at 1375
in so doing the majority_opinion is internally inconsistent and as to the standard of review applicable to the inequitable_conduct_determination incorrect
given that meihao filed this motion after the entire consolidated case had been dismissed there were no claims or counterclaims pending at the time of the inequitable_conduct_determination
thus the inequitable_conduct_determination was clearly not a summary_judgment decision and should not be reviewed as such
nevertheless my disagreement with the majority in no way rests on the standard of review
even under the more rigorous de novo_standard of review i would affirm the district_courts determination of inequitable_conduct in light of the particularly egregious facts of this case
as such i have treated the case under the majoritys premise that the district_court made its inequitable_conduct_determination on summary_judgment
2
the degree of materiality plays a critical role in the intent analysis
the more material the withheld reference the more likely that an inference of deceptive_intent is` the single most reasonable_inference able to be drawn from the evidence'
see star_scientific 537 f.3d at 1365 ; see also cargill inc. v. canbra_foods ltd. 476_f.3d_1359 1366-67 fed.cir.2007 quoting critikon inc. v. becton dickinson vascular access inc. 120_f.3d_1253 1257 fed.cir.1997 ; purdue pharma l.p. v. endo pharms inc. 438_f.3d_1123 1134-35 fed.cir.2006

i am not sure what to make of the majoritys statement that` [ w ] e rarely affirm a grant of summary_judgment of inequitable_conduct and in those cases where we have affirmed the applicants did something other than fail to disclose a commonly owned application or related_litigation'
majority_op.at 1363 ; see id.at 1373-74
the majority appears to be resting at least in part on the idea that we have never faced facts analogous to those presented in this case
i agree with the majority that the striking facts of this case are unusual yet i can not agree that this is a reason not to affirm the district_courts finding of inequitable_conduct
we regularly decide cases involving novel facts by applying our legal_standards to the new factual situation presented
in my view the novelty of the factual situation currently before the court suggests only that the exceptional and egregious conduct in this case is not common amongst practitioners before the pto
4
this is perhaps a result of the parties errors at oral_argument
in arguing that narcisse admitted his awareness of his duty to disclose the related_litigation meihaos counsel cited the wrong page of narcisses deposition_testimony
meihaos counsel cited to j.a.1975 but the proper citation is j.a.2008
see oral_arg.at 43:52-45:55 ; j.a.2008
as such levitons counsel was also incorrect in asserting his belief that there was not` any testimony that [ narcisse was ] aware of this particular provision' namely mpep_¡± 2001.06 c
