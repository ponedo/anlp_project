opinion
schall circuit_judge
this is a patent case
medtronic inc.` medtronic' is a manufacturer of medical_devices
it filed a declaratory_judgment_action in the united_states_district_court for the district of delaware against guidant_corporation guidant_sales_corporation eli_lilly & company` eli_lilly' and mirowski_family_ventures_l.l.c
in the action medtronic alleged that claims 15-26 of u.s. reissue patent no._38119` the rebig_token__¡¬119_patent__big_token` a reissue of u.s._patent_no._4928,688` the ¡¬688_patent` are invalid by reason of violation of the rule against recapturing surrendered subject_matter
the rebig_token__¡¬119_patent__big_token claims a method and a pacemaker_apparatus
both relate to a` procedure for pacing of the heart in a particular way so as to improve its contraction pattern and thereby augment the movement of blood through the heart'
re¡¬ 119 patent col._3,_ll._33-35
mirowski_family_ventures_l.l.c
and eli_lilly are respectively the assignee and exclusive_licensee of the patent
guidant_corporation is a medical device manufacturer that was formed in 1994 when eli_lilly divested certain assets while guidant_sales_corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary of guidant_corporation
for ease of reference we refer to the four defendants as` guidant'

medtronic now appeals from the final judgment of the district_court following a *1365 bench trial that the rebig_token__¡¬119_patent__big_token is not invalid
see medtronic inc. v. guidant_corp. 378_f.supp.2d_503 d.del.2005
we affirm

background
i
a
the heart is made up of four chambers two atria and two ventricles
electrical stimulations depolarizations within the chambers cause contractions within the heart that result in pumping
the electrical_activity arises in the right atrium and is eventually transmitted to the ventricles
the period of time from depolarization of the atria to depolarization of the ventricles is called the` a-v_delay_period'

dr. morton mower is the inventor named on the rebig_token__¡¬119_patent__big_token
his invention involves a method and apparatus for treating ventricular asynchrony a condition in which a person has a defect in his or her heart ventricles
the defect causes the ventricles to contract at different times
this results in the loss of effectiveness in the pumping of blood
the method of the rebig_token__¡¬119_patent__big_token works through a pacemaker device invented by dr._mower which either conditionally or unconditionally paces the two ventricles of the heart to cause simultaneous ventricular contractions
the` conditional_embodiment' of the invention requires sensing a depolarization in a first_ventricle then waiting for a predetermined period of time to sense a depolarization in the second_ventricle
if no depolarization is sensed in the second_ventricle the device stimulates or` paces' the second_ventricle with an electrical pulse
this embodiment of the invention is called` conditional' because the delivery of pacing_pulses depends on the analysis of the cardiac_signals
in the` unconditional_embodiment' depolarization is sensed in either ventricle and as soon as depolarization in one ventricle is sensed both ventricles are immediately paced
in the` unconditional_embodiment' one ventricle will be paced twice once naturally and once by the device

in the inventions conditional_embodiment there are two apparatuses to sense electrical_activity` sensing_electrodes'
there is one sensing_electrode in each ventricle
in addition there is at least one pacing_electrode to pace the second_ventricle
in the unconditional_embodiment there may be only one sensing_electrode as once a depolarization is sensed in one ventricle the other_ventricle is immediately paced
however there are always two pacing_electrodes so that both ventricles may be paced at the same_time

b
in the late 1980s dr._mower asked ron cohn to prepare a patent application for his invention
on october 30 1987 cardiac pacemakers inc. now a wholly owned subsidiary of guidant_corporation where dr._mower was employed forwarded mr._cohns draft_application to attorney thomas nikolai to prepare a final application
on december 3 1987 mr._nikolai asked dr._mower to review the draft_application explaining that he had added the concept of a` window of coincidence' -a delay between sensing and pacing

on august 23 1988 mr._cohn pursuant to instructions from dr._mower forwarded dr._mowers comments to mr._nikolai advising him that the essence of dr._mowers invention was` a bi-ventricular pacer [ that ] continually senses the activity of both the left and right_ventricles and when activity is sensed in either ventricle the device immediately electrically paces the other or both ventricles'
with respect to mr._nikolais concern about a` window of coincidence' mr._cohn stated that to have a delay between sensing and pacing would *1366 undermine the purpose of the invention which he said was to cause a simultaneous_contraction of the ventricles
on august 31 1988 mr._nikolai responded to mr._cohns letter with a letter to dr._mower stating that he was` puzzled' about how the invention could sense the depolarization of one ventricle and then decide whether to pace the other_ventricle without a delay period

on september 9 1988 dr._mower explained to mr._nikolai that while the mechanism would in some cases stimulate a ventricle that was in fact contracting normally that was not a problem because` the artificial stimulus will fall harmlessly into the intrinsic depolarization'
mr._nikolai then amended the specification to include a description of the unconditional_embodiment

c. on january 23 1989 u.s. patent application no._07 /299,895` the ¡¬895_application' was filed with the patent and trademark office for dr._mowers invention
as filed the ¡¬895_application had twenty-two claims including six independent_claims claims 1 7 15-17 and 19
pertinent to this case claims 1 7 15 and 16 of the ¡¬895_application stated 1
a method for improving the hemodynamic_efficiency of a sick heart comprising the steps of a detecting respective_cardiac_signals originating in the left and right_ventricles of the heart ; b analyzing said cardiac_signals and the absence thereof in an electronic_control_circuit ; c providing electrical_pulses from a stimulating circuit controlled by said control_circuit for effecting substantially simultaneous_contraction of both ventricles
7
an atrial-coupled bi-ventricular_pacemaker for implantation or external_use comprising atria and ventricular_sensing_means for detecting cardiac_signals a control_circuit connected to said sensing means to analyze the cardiac_signals and provide a control_signal a stimulating circuit for effecting simultaneous_contraction of both ventricles in response to the control_signal of the control_circuit after a pre-determined a-v_delay_period
15
a method for effecting simultaneous_contraction of both left and right_ventricles of a heart for improving hemodynamic_efficiency comprising the steps of separately sensing cardiac_signals from both left and right_ventricles ; and
stimulating at least one ventricle substantially simultaneously with the contraction of at least one other_ventricle
16
a method of effecting simultaneous_contraction of both left and right_ventricles of a heart for improving hemodynamic_efficiency comprising the steps of sensing the cardiac_signals of the atria and separately sensing the cardiac_signals of both the left and right_ventricles ; and
stimulating at least one ventricle simultaneously with the contraction of at least one other_ventricle after a predetermined a-v_period
the specification included the following language directed towards the unconditional_embodiment it is also contemplated that when a ventricular depolarization signal is sensed in one or the other of the ventricles that a stimulating pulse may also be immediately delivered on an unconditional basis to both ventricles via the implanted leads 13_and_15 thus resulting in a coordinated_contraction of both ventricles

*1367 on june_9,_1989 the examiner issued a first office action allowing claims 15_and_16 but rejecting the remaining twenty claims
independent_claims 1_and_7 and dependent_claims 4-big_token__6_and_12__big_token -14 were rejected as anticipated by u.s._patent_no._4378,020` nappholz'
the examiner asserted that nappholz showed` all of the structure of the above_claims'
at the same_time the examiner rejected dependent_claims 2 3 8 and 9 as obvious in view of nappholz and u.s._patent_no._4774,950` cohen'
the examiner asserted that cohen showed` a means to sense a cardiac signal from the left or right_ventricles
it is deemed to have been obvious to use cohen with the pacemaker in nappholz et_al in order to more efficiently and effectively pace and sense the heart'
the examiner explained however that` [ t ] he prior_art does not show means to sense and stimulate both ventricles in a selective or alternate manner'
the examiner suggested that dependent_claims 10_and_11 and independent_claims 17_and_19 as well as dependent_claims 18_and_20 -22 would be allowed if their form was corrected

mr._nikolai responded on june_16,_1989 by canceling claim 6 by adding several claims and by amending certain_claims
mr._nikolai added independent claim 23 and dependent_claims 24-27 all directed to the pacemaker_apparatus
at the same_time he amended limitation c of claim 1 to read as follows` providing electrical_pulses from a stimulating circuit controlled by said control_circuit to one the other or both ventricles as required for effecting substantially simultaneous_contraction of both ventricles'
( amendment underlined
at the same_time mr._nikolai amended the first clause of claim 7 to read as follows` an atrial-coupled bi-ventricular_pacemaker for implantation or external_use comprising [ atria ] atrial and ventricular_sensing_means for detecting cardiac_signals originating in the atrium and both ventricles
...' amendment underlined removal bracketed
mr._nikolai distinguished the prior_art from independent_claims 1_and_7 and dependent_claims 12-14 by arguing [ i ] t is clear that the method being claimed involves detecting the respective_cardiac_signals originating in the left and the right_ventricles of the heart
after analyzing those cardiac_signals or the absence thereof in an electronic_control_circuit electrical_pulses are provided from a stimulating circuit to one the other or both ventricles for effecting substantially simultaneous_contraction of both ventricles
clearly nappholz does not teach this method
the nappholz_patent describes a.. pacemaker having a single_atrial_electrode and a single_ventricular_electrode..
thus the device of that patent is incapable of picking up ventricular_depolarization_signals from both ventricles
( emphasis in original1 mr._nikolai further argued that claims 7_and_12 -14 of the ¡¬895_application were distinguishable over nappholz because unlike nappholz they called for` sensing cardiac_signals originating in the atrium and in both ventricles and then stimulating both ventricles in a fashion such that simultaneous_contraction of the ventricles occur [ s ] after a predetermined a-v_delay_period'
mr._nikolai argued that dependent_claims 2 3 8 and 9 of the ¡¬895_application were not obvious in light of nappholz and cohen because nappholz disclosed a pacemaker that sensed and selectively paced an atrium and sensed and selectively paced a ventricle while cohen had electrodes in the ventricles that *1368 paced but did not sense
he urged that the two references did not suggest

the idea of placing sensing_electrodes in both the left and right_ventricles and providing a control_circuit capable of detecting the depolarization signals from both the left and right_ventricles and to then provide control_signals to a stimulating circuit that is used to stimulate one the other or both ventricles whereby substantially simultaneous_contraction of both ventricles and improved hemodynamic_efficiency results
( emphasis in original
the examiner responded on september 6 1989 allowing dependent_claims 4_and_15 -22 but rejecting all other pending claims
claims 1-big_token__3_and_5__big_token were rejected as obvious in view of u.s._patent_no._4088,140` rockland' on the ground that the method of claims 1-big_token__3_and_5__big_token would be` within the scope of the skilled artisan when utilizing the rockland..
invention'
claims 7-big_token__9_and_12__big_token -14 were rejected as anticipated in view of rockland on the ground that` rockland.. shows all of the basic structure of the above_claims'
claims 10 23 and 25-27 were rejected as being obvious in view of rockland and u.s. patent no._3937,226` funke' because it would be` an obvious engineering design choice.. to connect the ventricular electrodes in series as shown by funke'
finally claims 11_and_24 were rejected as being obvious in view of rockland and funke and further in view of an additional patent` mccorkle' because` [ i ] t would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art to use mccorkle with rockland et_al and funke in order to more efficiently and accurately pace/sense ventricular depolarizations'

mr._nikolai responded by amending certain_claims and canceling claims 4 7-14 and 25-27
he amended claim 1 to add the following to limitation c of the claim said step of analyzing including providing a control_signal from said control_circuit to said stimulating circuit for producing an electrical_stimulating_pulse to one or both ventricles in response to the absence of a detected_cardiac_signal from one or both ventricles within a time interval which is a small fraction of the pulse width of a detected_cardiac_signal
mr._nikolai contended that after this amendment claim 1 and claims 2 3 and 5 which depended directly or indirectly from claim 1 were allowable
mr._nikolai argued that claim 23 was not obvious in light of rockland and funke because rockland failed` to disclose a pacer apparatus having circuitry for analyzing cardiac_signals originating in the right and left_ventricles for selectively providing stimulating or pacing_pulses only to the right_ventricle if a normal cardiac signal is missing there or to the left_ventricle if the left_ventricle is not producing normal heart activity in the left_ventricle'
because claim 24 depended from claim 23 mr._nikolai asserted that it too was not obvious

on december 5 1989 the examiner and mr._nikolai conducted a telephone interview
after the interview the examiner made an examiners amendment for` minor_wording_changes' to put claims 15 16 and other_claims` in condition for allowance'
the notice of allowability issued on december 11 1989
after the amendment claims 15_and_16 of the ¡¬895_application read as follows 15
a method for effecting simultaneous_contraction of both left and right_ventricles of a heart for improving hemodynamic_efficiency comprising the steps of separately sensing for the presence of cardiac_depolarization_signals from both left and right_ventricles ; determining whether said cardiac_depolarization_signals are simultaneously *1369 present in both the left and right_ventricles ; and stimulating at least one ventricle substantially simultaneously with the contraction of at least one other_ventricle in the event that said cardiac_depolarization_signals are determined not to be simultaneously present in both ventricles
16
a method of effecting simultaneous_contraction of both left and right_ventricles of a heart for improving hemodynamic_efficiency comprising the steps of sensing the cardiac_signals of the atria and separately sensing the cardiac_depolarization_signals of both the left and right_ventricles ; determining whether said cardiac_depolarization_signals are simultaneously present in both the left and right_ventricles ; stimulating at least one ventricle simultaneously with the contraction of at least one other_ventricle after a predetermined a-v_period in the event that said cardiac_depolarization_signals are determined not to be simultaneously present in both ventricles
( examiners amendment emphasized
as can be seen whereas before the examiners amendment claims 15_and_16 claimed dr._mowers unconditional_embodiment after the amendment they claimed only the conditional_embodiment

on may_29,_1990 the ¡¬688_patent issued to dr._mower
claims 1-3 5 and 15-24 of the ¡¬895_application issued as respectively claims 1-14 in the ¡¬ 688 patent

d. on may_29,_1992 pursuant to 35 u.s.c.¡± 251 mr._cohn on behalf of dr._mower sought reissue of the ¡¬688_patent with existing claims 1-14 and new_claims 15-24
claims 15-24 of the application were directed to the unconditional_embodiment
dr._mowers reissue declaration stated that he had` claimed less than [ he ] had a right to claim in the patent' as the claims inadvertently did not include the unconditional_embodiment.2 he suggested that the embodiment was disclosed in the specification that it might be implicitly covered by the claims but that it was not explicitly claimed

on april_8,_1993 the examiner rejected all claims in the reissue_application
the examiner rejected new_claims 15-24 pursuant to 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 first paragraph stating that the specification did not support the invention
he explained that in the specification` it is mentioned that both ventricles are immediately stimulated' but in claims 15-24` it is claimed that one or both ventricles are immediately stimulated'
( underlining in original

mr._cohn amended claims 15 16 19 and 20 to more explicitly claim the unconditional_embodiment and argued that the specification did describe the invention
the examiner then allowed reissue_claims 1-big_token__18_and_20__big_token -24 but rejected claim 19
the examiner asserted that claim 19 was obvious in light of u.s._patent_no._4624,260` baker' and rockland and obvious in light of baker and funke
mr._cohn responded by arguing that claim 19 was not obvious in light of the prior_art because neither baker nor rockland taught pacing in both ventricles followed by an a-v_delay_period
he also added two claims claims 25_and_26 to distinguish baker rockland and funke

the rebig_token__¡¬119_patent__big_token issued on may_20,_2003
the rebig_token__¡¬119_patent__big_token has 26 claims
claims 1-14 of the rebig_token__¡¬119_patent__big_token are identical to claims 1-14 of the ¡¬688_patent
*1370 of the remaining claims which are new claims 15 19 22 and 25 are independent

ii
a
on august 29 2003 medtronic filed a declaratory_judgment_action against guidant alleging that claims 15-26 of the rebig_token__¡¬119_patent__big_token are invalid because the unconditional_embodiment and the embodiment with only one sensing_electrode were improperly recaptured
the unconditional_embodiment appears in claims 15-26
claim 15 of the rebig_token__¡¬119_patent__big_token is representative
it states 15
a method for improving the hemodynamic_efficiency of a heart comprising the steps of detecting a cardiac_depolarization_signal originating from a first_ventricle ; immediately and unconditionally stimulating both ventricles for effecting a coordinated_contraction of both ventricles when a cardiac_depolarization_signal originating from the first_ventricle is detected
rebig_token__¡¬119_patent__big_token claim 15
the embodiment requiring only one sensing_electrode appears in at least claims 15 16 25 and 26 of the rebig_token__¡¬119_patent__big_token3 representative claim 15 for example is broad enough to include a device with one sensing_electrode because it only requires` detecting a cardiac_depolarization_signal originating from a first_ventricle'

medtronic urged that both the unconditional_embodiment and the embodiment with only one sensing_electrode were recaptured because they were claimed in the original_claims and amended during prosecution or they were surrendered via argument during prosecution
specifically medtronic asserted that claims 1 7 15 and 16 of the ¡¬895_application cover the unconditional_embodiment but were amended to cover only the conditional_embodiment
as far as the embodiment with one sensing_electrode was concerned medtronic argued that the embodiment which it asserted appears in claims 15-big_token__18_and_22__big_token -26 of the re¡¬ 119 patent was surrendered during prosecution

in november 2004 the district_court held a three-day bench trial
medtronic argued that there was no error during the prosecution of the ¡¬895_application that would justify reissuing the patent under 35 u.s.c.¡± 251
guidant responded that the error was attorney error resulting from mr._nikolais failure to understand the technology

in its decision rendered after trial the district_court ruled that the re¡¬ 119 patent did not improperly recapture subject_matter that was surrendered during prosecution
medtronic 378_f.supp.2d_503
it rejected medtronics argument that dr._mower surrendered the unconditional_embodiment and any embodiment with only one sensing_electrode agreeing with guidant that the original_claims of the ¡¬895_application did not include the unconditional_embodiment and that dr._mower did not *1371 surrender a device that senses depolarizations in only one ventricle
id.at 515-19

the court first determined that the unconditional_embodiment was not surrendered by amendment
id.at 515-16
the court found that the claims of the ¡¬895_application that originally included the unconditional_embodiment were claim 15 of the ¡¬895_application which became claim 5 of the ¡¬688_patent and claim 16 of the ¡¬895_application which became claim 6 of the ¡¬ 688 patent
id
the court noted that at the end of prosecution the examiner narrowed the two claims to exclude immediate and unconditional_pacing
id.at 516
the court reasoned that neither claim 15_nor_16 of the ¡¬895_application was rejected as anticipated over prior_art and that the addition of the conditional limitation to the claims when they became claims 5_and_6 of the ¡¬688_patent were wording changes as characterized by the examiner so the recapture_rule did not apply to the reissue_claims of the re¡¬ 119 patent that include the unconditional_embodiment-claims 15-26 of the rebig_token__¡¬119_patent__big_token
id

the court next found that the unconditional_embodiment was not surrendered by argument
id.at 517
the court determined first that the distinction over nappholz made by mr._nikolai during prosecution was` directed towards the fact that nappholz only discloses one electrode not whether nappholz immediately and unconditionally paces both ventricles'
id
next the court found mr._nikolai distinguished cohen because cohen` did not have electrodes that could both sense and pace and not because of the way it paced the ventricles'
id
addressing the distinction that mr._nikolai drew over rockland the court stated that` rockland described a device that paced a plurality of sites over a predetermined_time_period' while` the unconditional_embodiment immediately paces the ventricles and therefore has no predetermined_time_period'
id

the court also found that the embodiment with only one sensing_electrode-specifically the embodiment represented by claim 15 of the re¡¬ 119 patent-was not surrendered during prosecution by amendment
id
the court determined that claim 15 of the rebig_token__¡¬119_patent__big_token` claims a device with only one ventricular_sensing_electrode as it requires onlydetecting a cardiac_depolarization_signal originating from a first_ventricle and two pacing_electrodes as it paces both ventricles unconditionally'
id.at 517-18
the claims of the ¡¬895_application which issued in the ¡¬688_patent however did not include an embodiment with only one sensing_electrode` [ a ] ll of the claims of the ¡¬895_application refer to some means of sensing in both the right and left_ventricles'
id.at 517 emphases in original
the court concluded that` [ b ] ecause the claims of the ¡¬895_application did not include an embodiment without two sensing_electrodes the patentee did not surrender subject_matter [ relating to just one sensing_electrode ] via an amendment during prosecution'
id.at 518

finally the district_court determined that the embodiment with only one sensing_electrode which is claimed in claim 15 of the rebig_token__¡¬119_patent__big_token was not surrendered by argument
id
the court first considered arguments made to distinguish the claimed invention over nappholz
id
during prosecution of the ¡¬895_application dr._mower distinguished nappholz on the ground that it did not have two sensing_electrodes and two pacing_electrodes
id
the court noted that in distinguishing nappholz mr._nikolai had stated that` the nappholz_device wasincapable of picking up ventricular_depolarization_signals from both ventricles and for ultimately providing stimulation to both ventricles which *1372 was characteristic of the invention of the ¡¬688_patent'
id
the district_court reasoned that` [ a ] ssuming that these statements are sufficient to surrender subject_matter during prosecution the surrendered subject_matter i.e. a pacemaker with one ventricular_pacing_electrode does not appear in the reissue_claims'
id
the court pointed out that the device of claim 15 of the rebig_token__¡¬119_patent__big_token explicitly requires pacing in both ventricles and that therefore the claim` does not recapture the subject_matter allegedly relinquished to distinguish nappholz as the nappholz_device only allowed for one pacing_electrode'
id
with respect to arguments made over cohen the court explained that cohen was distinguished because it only had electrodes that paced and did not sense depolarizations
id
`` such an embodiment' the court stated` is not included in the reissue_claims which require at least one electrode that can both sense and pace'
id
finally the district_court turned to the argument that was made during prosecution to distinguish rockland
the court noted that mr._nikolai had distinguished rockland from the invention claimed in the ¡¬895_application on the ground that it did not have analyzing circuitry and that it paced the heart over a predetermined_time_period at a plurality of points upon sensing depolarization
id
the court determined that because the reissue_claims require immediate and unconditional_pacing of only the ventricles upon depolarization` they do not include the embodiment disclosed in rockland because they do not include a predetermined_time_period or pacing at more than two points'
id
based upon its analysis the district_court ruled that by claiming an embodiment with only one sensing_electrode the re 119 patent did not recapture material that was surrendered by argument during prosecution of the ¡¬895_application
id

wilder 736 f.2d at 1519

reissue proceedings however can not be used to obtain subject_matter that could not have been included in the original_patent

a. medtronic contends first that claims 15_through_26 of the rebig_token__¡¬119_patent__big_token are invalid because they recapture the unconditional_embodiment
medtronic asserts that this embodiment was surrendered both by amendment and by argument during prosecution of the ¡¬895_application

medtronic argues that claims 1 7 15 and 16 of the ¡¬895_application as filed covered the unconditional_embodiment and that during prosecution their scope was limited to the conditional_embodiment
it argues that claims 15_through_26 of the rebig_token__¡¬119_patent__big_token improperly recapture the unconditional_embodiment
guidant responds that the recapture_rule does not apply to claims 15-26 of the rebig_token__¡¬119_patent__big_token because as filed claims 1 7 15 and 16 of the ¡¬895_application were directed to the conditional_embodiment
it urges that the district_court correctly held that the unconditional_embodiment was not surrendered by amendment

the first_issue is whether the claims at issue in this case claims 1 7 15 and 16 of the ¡¬895_application,4 ever disclosed the *1374 unconditional_embodiment

' a claim of a reissue_application is broader in scope than the original_claims if it contains within its scope any conceivable apparatus or process which would not have infringed the original_patent
a reissue_claim that is broader in any respect is considered to be broader than the original_claims even though it may be narrower in other_respects
`` id.at 1374 quoting tillotson ltd. v. walbro corp. 831_f.2d_1033 1037_n._2_(fed.cir.1987) ; see also pannu 258 f.3d at 1371 stating that a reissue_claim that does not include a limitation present in the original_claims is broader than the original_claim

we agree with the district_court and guidant that independent_claims 1_and_7 of the ¡¬895_application as filed and the claims that depended from them claims 2-big_token__6_and_8__big_token -14 did not disclose the unconditional_embodiment
see medtronic 378 f.supp.2d at 516_n._22
as the district_court recognized these claims as filed required the processing of signals while in the unconditional_embodiment the device does not analyze or process any signals because it immediately and unconditionally stimulates the ventricles
claim 1 of the ¡¬895_application as filed required that the device` analyz [ e ] said cardiac_signals and the absence thereof' while claim 7 of the application as filed was limited to a device with a` control_circuit connected to said sensing means to analyze the cardiac_signals and provide a control_signal'
claims 1_and_7 of the ¡¬895_application never covered the unconditional_embodiment
because claims 1_and_7 of the ¡¬895_application as filed did not include the unconditional_embodiment the recapture_rule does not apply with respect to those claims

we agree with the district_court and medtronic that claims 15_and_16 of the ¡¬895_application as filed did include the unconditional_embodiment
claims 15_and_16 of the ¡¬895_application as filed disclosed a method for effecting simultaneous_contraction of both left and right_ventricles
in claim 15 one step was` stimulating at least one ventricle substantially simultaneously with the contraction of at least one other_ventricle'
claim 15 clearly covered the unconditional_embodiment because it immediately paced
in claim 16 as filed one step was` stimulating at least one ventricle simultaneously with the contraction of at least one other_ventricle after a predetermined a-v_period'
while there was a delay in claim 16 there was no analysis step
both claims described a device that paces at least one ventricle after the contraction of at least one ventricle so the claims as filed were directed to a device that immediately paces the ventricles-i.e. the unconditional_embodiment

because claims 15_and_16 did include the unconditional_embodiment we must consider whether the unconditional_embodiment was surrendered during prosecution
we agree with the district_court and medtronic that after the examiners amendment-characterized as making` minor_wording_changes' -claims 15_and_16 no longer covered the unconditional_embodiment
*1375 after the examiners amendment claim 15 of the ¡¬895_application as issued claim 5 in the ¡¬688_patent had the additional_limitations of` determining whether said cardiac_depolarization_signals are simultaneously present in both the left and right_ventricles ; and stimulating at least one ventricle substantially simultaneously with the contraction of at least one other_ventricle in the event that said cardiac_depolarization_signals are determined not to be simultaneously present in both ventricles'
¡¬688_patent claim 5 examiners amendment emphasized
claim 16 of the ¡¬895_application as issued claim 6 in the ¡¬688_patent had the additional_limitations of` determining whether said cardiac_depolarization_signals are simultaneously present in both the left and right_ventricles ; stimulating at least one ventricle simultaneously with the contraction of at least one other_ventricle after a predetermined a-v_period in the event that said cardiac_depolarization_signals are determined not to be simultaneously present in both ventricles'
id. claim 6 examiners amendment emphasized
with the addition of the language` determining whether said cardiac_depolarization_signals are simultaneously present in both the left and right_ventricles' claims 15_and_16 of the ¡¬895_application as issued no longer covered immediately pacing both ventricles-i.e. unconditional_pacing

while claims 15_and_16 of the ¡¬895_application did cover the unconditional_embodiment as filed and while they were amended so that they no longer covered that embodiment that alone does not mean that the unconditional_embodiment was surrendered
this court has recognized that whether recapture applies`necessarily depends upon the facts in each case and particularly on the reasons for the cancellation
`` mentor 998 f.2d at 995 quoting in re willingham 48_c.c.p.a._727 282_f.2d_353 357 1960
when we consider whether subject_matter was` surrendered' we look at whether there was a deliberate withdrawal or amendment in order to secure the patent as this kind of deliberate action is not the inadvertence or mistake that reissue is meant to remedy
see clement 131 f.3d at 1468-69 ; mentor 998 f.2d at 995

in this case there was no deliberate_surrender of subject_matter to obtain allowance of the claims
as discussed above an attorneys failure to appreciate the full_scope of the invention is a common source of defects in patents and has been found to be sufficient to justify reissuing a patent
see hester 142 f.3d at 1479-80 ; clement 131 f.3d at 1468 ; mentor 998 f.2d at 995 ; scripps 927 f.2d at 1575 ; wilder 736 f.2d at 1519
it is clear from the prosecution_history that neither the examiner nor the prosecuting attorney mr._nikolai considered the unconditional_embodiment a part of the invention
the fact that mr._nikolai thought the claims were directed to the conditional_embodiment alone is demonstrated by his correspondence with the inventor and with the examiner
the fact that the examiner thought that the claim was to the conditional_embodiment alone is demonstrated by the examiners amendment he made to add` minor_wording_changes'
this is the kind of inadvertence or mistake that the reissue doctrine was meant to remedy

further there is no evidence that the unconditional_embodiment could not have been included in the original_patent
there is also no evidence that the unconditional_embodiment was deliberately surrendered in an effort to overcome a prior_art_rejection
in fact there was no prior_art_rejection or any rejection at all
thus the examiners amendment was not prompted by a rejection
we agree with the district_court that because claims 15_and_16 were not amended over prior_art and because the amendments to the claims *1376 were made as clarifying amendments there was no clear admission that the unconditional_embodiment was not patentable
for this reason the reissue rule does not apply with respect to these claims

thus we agree with the district_court that claims 15_through_26 of the re¡¬ 119 patent are not invalid for recapturing the unconditional_embodiment by amendment

2
medtronic also argues that the unconditional_embodiment in claims 15-26 of the rebig_token__¡¬119_patent__big_token was surrendered by argument
guidant responds that medtronic has not shown a clear and unmistakable surrender as hester requires

we agree with the district_court that dr._mower did not surrender the unconditional_embodiment through arguments made during prosecution
mr._nikolai distinguished claims 1_and_7 of the ¡¬895_application and their dependent_claims which were directed to the conditional_embodiment on the ground that nappholz only disclosed a single_atrial_electrode and a single_ventricular_electrode and thus was unable to sense and pace both ventricles which is what is claimed in claims 15_and_16 of the rebig_token__¡¬119_patent__big_token
thus mr._nikolai did not distinguish nappholz one the grounds that nappholz immediately and unconditionally paced both ventricles

mr._nikolai also distinguished the rejected dependent_claims 2 3 8 and 9 of the ¡¬895_application which were directed to the conditional_embodiment from cohen on the ground that cohen had electrodes in the ventricles that paced but did not sense
in the unconditional_embodiment in claims 15-26 of the rebig_token__¡¬119_patent__big_token however there is at lease one sensing_electrode in a ventricle
thus mr._nikolai did not clearly and unmistakably surrender the unconditional_embodiment

medtronic also points to the arguments made by mr._nikolai with respect to rejected claim 23 of the ¡¬895_application in support of its argument that the unconditional_embodiment was surrendered by amendment
mr._nikolai distinguished rockland because it could not selectively analyze and instead described a device that paced over a predetermined_time_interval
the unconditional_embodiment on the other hand may immediately pace after a depolarization is sensed in one ventricle
thus mr._nikolai did not clearly and unmistakably surrender the unconditional_embodiment

thus we agree with the district_court that claims 15_through_26 of the re¡¬ 119 patent are not invalid for recapturing the unconditional_embodiment by argument

b. medtronic argues that claims 15 16 and 22-26 of the rebig_token__¡¬119_patent__big_token are invalid because they recapture the embodiment with only one sensing_electrode
according to medtronic this embodiment was surrendered by amendment and argument during prosecution of the ¡¬895_application

1
medtronic asserts that claim 7 of the ¡¬895_application as filed covered sensing in a single_ventricle as well as sensing in both ventricles and was amended to surrender sensing in only one ventricle
according to medtronic claim 7 covered sensing in a single_ventricle because the term` ventricular_sensing_means' encompassed sensing in either one ventricle or in both ventricles
second it asserts that claims 15 16 and 22-26 of the rebig_token__¡¬119_patent__big_token improperly recapture the embodiment with only one sensing_electrode that was surrendered during prosecution
guidant responds that the district_court correctly held that the embodiment with only one sensing_electrode was not surrendered by amendment *1377 because original_claim 7 required sensing from both ventricles and medtronics arguments do not apply to reissue_claims 22-24 because they require sensing from both ventricles

the first_issue we must address is whether claim 7 of the ¡¬895_application ever disclosed the` sensing of electrical_activity in only one ventricle' embodiment
see n._am
container 415 f.3d at 1349
if it did the second_issue is whether that subject_matter was surrendered during prosecution
id
if it was the final_question is whether reissue_claims were materially narrowed in other_respects so that the claims may not have been enlarged to avoid the recapture_rule
id

we agree with the district_court that claim 7 in the ¡¬895_application as filed did not include an embodiment with only one sensing_electrode
medtronic is incorrect that claim 7 of the ¡¬895_application as filed covered sensing in a single_ventricle as well as sensing in both ventricles
the claim refers to a` bi-ventricular_pacemaker' indicating that sensing is done in both ventricles
the claim uses the term` detecting cardiac_signals' indicating that several sensing_electrodes would be used
while one could argue that the term` signals' as used means signals over time instead of multiple signals at the same_time later in the claim the singular term` signal' is used to describe the control_signal of the control_circuit
if the term` signals' referred to one single source of a signal over time the claim would use` signals' again later when referring to the control_signal
the addition of the language` originating in the atrium and both ventricles' does not narrow the scope of the claim as it was always directed to sensing in both ventricles
in fact the addition of this language after` detecting cardiac_signals' demonstrates even more clearly that there are signals and not a signal which require multiple sensing_electrodes

thus we agree with the district_court that claims 15 16 and 22-26 of the rebig_token__¡¬119_patent__big_token are not invalid for recapturing the embodiment with only one sensing_electrode by amendment

2
medtronic also argues that the embodiment with only one sensing_electrode in the reissue_claims was surrendered by argument
guidant responds that the district_court correctly held that this embodiment was not surrendered by argument

as discussed above if the claims of a reissue_patent violate the recapture_rule the claims are invalid see n._am
container 415 f.3d at 1349 and surrender can occur by way of amendments or arguments see hester 142 f.3d at 1480-81
the district_court held that the embodiment with only one sensing_electrode was not surrendered by argument
medtronic 378 f.supp.2d at 518
with respect to nappholz the court recognized that during prosecution of the ¡¬895_application mr._nikolai distinguished nappholz because nappholz did not have two sensing_electrodes and it also did not have two pacing_electrodes
id
the court determined that` [ a ] ssuming that these statements are sufficient to surrender subject_matter during prosecution' the surrendered subject_matter-a pacemaker with one ventricular_pacing_electrode-did not appear in the reissue_claims because claim 15 of the rebig_token__¡¬119_patent__big_token` explicitly requires pacing in both ventricles'
id
the court concluded that` [ t ] his does not recapture the subject_matter allegedly relinquished to distinguish nappholz as the nappholz_device only allowed for one pacing_electrode
therefore claim 15 is materially narrowed *1378 and would have been patentable over nappholz'
id

we see no error in the district_courts ruling with respect to the arguments made to distinguish nappholz
as the court noted mr._nikolais argument with respect to nappholz was based on the proposition that dr._mowers invention was distinguishable over and narrower than nappholz because it required two sensing_electrodes
as indicated above when a reissue_claim while broader in certain respects than the original_patent claim is materially narrowed in other_respects the recapture_rule does not apply
see n._am
container 415 f.3d at 1349
the district_courts ruling with respect to mr._nikolais arguments relating to nappholz recognizes this rule

moreover further support for the district_courts ruling lies in the fact that the statements regarding nappholz made during prosecution of the ¡¬895_application were not unmistakable_assertions in support of patentability over the embodiment with a single sensing_electrode
mr._nikolai distinguished nappholz from the conditional_embodiment on the ground that nappholz had only a single_atrial_electrode and a single_ventricular_electrode and thus was unable to sense and pace both ventricles.5 in the unconditional_embodiment claimed in the rebig_token__¡¬119_patent__big_token there may be only one sensing_electrode as once a depolarization is sensed both ventricles are immediately paced but there are two pacing_electrodes in the ventricles unlike nappholz
we do not think mr._nikolais statements about nappholzs single_ventricular_sensing_electrode which were made in the context of distinguishing nappholz from dr._mowers conditional_embodiment are unmistakable_assertions in support of patentability distinguishing it from the embodiment with only one sensing_electrode
that is because the statements were not made in the context of distinguishing nappholz and the claimed invention based on the number of sensing_electrodes but rather in the context of distinguishing nappholz from the conditional_embodiment
in other_words we can not say that the statement was an unmistakable_assertion in support of patentability that invalidates the reissue_patent_claims covering the embodiment with only one sensing_electrode

as discussed above mr._nikolai distinguished cohen from his invention of the ground that cohen had electrodes in the ventricles that paced but did not sense
this distinction is not relevant to the embodiment with only one sensing_electrode as cohen can not sense
finally as far as rockland is concerned mr._nikolai distinguished rockland on the ground that it could not selectively analyze and instead described a device that paced over a predetermined_time_interval
this distinction is also irrelevant to the embodiment with only one sensing_electrode as that embodiment does not require a predetermined_time_period

thus we agree with the district_court that claims 15 16 and 22-26 of the *1379 rebig_token__¡¬119_patent__big_token are not invalid for recapturing the embodiment with only one sensing_electrode because that embodiment was previously surrendered by argument

conclusion
in sum we affirm the district_courts determination that claims 15-26 of the rebig_token__¡¬119_patent__big_token are not invalid
we do so because we agree with the district_court that neither the unconditional_embodiment nor the embodiment with only one sensing_electrode both of which were covered by those claims was surrendered by amendment or argument during prosecution of the ¡¬895_application

container 415 f.3d at 1349
in my view the timing and content of mr._nikolais statements regarding claim 23 and of the examiners amendments to claims 15_and_16 lead to the conclusion that medtronic deliberately surrendered the unconditional_embodiment during prosecution of the original_patent

it is clear and the majority agrees that claims 15_and_16 as originally drafted covered the unconditional_embodiment of the invention as well as its conditional_embodiment
it is undisputed that after the examiners amendment to claims 15 *big_token__1380_and_16__big_token those claims no longer covered the unconditional_embodiment
the examiners statements made at the time of the amendment of claims 15_and_16 -characterizing the language changes as` minor_wording_changes' -on their face do not demonstrate a concern with patentability
however it is quite clear that the amendments were not in fact minor_wording_changes and the examiner stated that the amendments were necessary in order to put claims 15_and_16` in condition for allowance'
in light of the prosecution_history the amendments to claims 15-16 in my view were plainly directed to patentability

claim 23 of the ¡¬895_application originally included both the conditional and unconditional_embodiments as did the original language of claims 15_and_16
on september 6 1989 the examiner rejected claim 23 as obvious in light of the rockland and funke prior_art
mr._nikolais statements designed to overcome the rejection of claim 23 were clearly directed towards patentability
in his september 26 1989 response to the examiner mr._nikolai distinguished the prior_art on the basis that rockland could not` analyz [ e ] cardiac_signals' and` selectively.. stimulat [ e ] or pac [ e ]' one ventricle in other_words that the prior_art did not disclose the conditional_embodiment
claim 23 was then amended to add language limiting it to the conditional_embodiment.1 based on these representations as to the prior_art and the amendment limiting the scope of claim 23 to the conditional_embodiment the claim eventually was allowed as claim 13 of the ¡¬688_patent with minor additional language changes

a few weeks after mr._nikolais statements concerning claim 23 and the amendment to that claim on december 5 1989 the examiner similarly amended claims 15_and_16 to require` determining whether.. signals.. are simultaneously present' the very analysis function that mr._nikolai referred to in his claim 23 statement
the language of claims 15_and_16 was also amended as the language of claim 23 had been amended to make clear the conditional nature of the ventricle stimulation
given this sequence of events i think it is clear that the examiners amendment to claims 15_and_16 -which the majority agrees resulted in the elimination of the unconditional_embodiment and the limitation of the those claims to the conditional_embodiment-was made to avoid the same prior_art that had caused claim 23s original rejection
in other_words an objective_observer viewing the prosecution_history would conclude that *1381 the unconditional_embodiment was deliberately surrendered to avoid a prior_art_rejection of claim 23 and an analogous prior_art problem in claims 15_and_16
under these circumstances the recapture of the unconditional_embodiment in the reissue_patent was improper

mr._nikolai distinguished nappholz because
it is clear that the method being claimed involves detecting the respective_cardiac_signals originating in the left and the right_ventricles of the heart
after analyzing those cardiac_signals or the absence thereof in an electronic_control_circuit electrical_pulses are provided from a stimulating circuit to one the other or both ventricles for effecting substantially simultaneous_contraction of both ventricles
clearly nappholz does not teach this method
the nappholz_patent describes a.. pacemaker having a single_atrial_electrode and a single_ventricular_electrode..
thus the device of that patent is incapable of picking up ventricular_depolarization_signals from both ventricles
