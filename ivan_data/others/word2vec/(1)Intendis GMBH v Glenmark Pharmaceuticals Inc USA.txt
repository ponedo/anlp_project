moore circuit_judge
this case arises under the hatch-waxman act,1 and involves glenmark_pharmaceuticals_ltd. and glenmark_pharmaceuticals_inc. usas collectively` glenmark' 2 proposed generic_version of finaceathe_r_gel a topical medication for various skin disorders
glenmark appeals the united_states_district_court for the district of delawares final_judgment entered in favor of intendis_gmbh intraserv_gmbh & co._kg and bayer healthcare pharmaceuticals inc. collectively` appellees'
for the reasons set forth below we affirm

*1359 background
appellee bayer healthcare pharmaceuticals inc. holds approved new drug application` nda' no._21470 for finaceathe_r_gel which contains azelaic_acid as the therapeutically active_ingredient in a concentration of 15 % by weight and is indicated for the topical_treatment of inflammatory_papules and pustules of mild to moderate_rosacea
finaceathe_r_gels inactive_ingredients known as excipients include triglycerides and lecithin
finaceathe_r_gel is manufactured in the form of a` hydrogel' which the district_court construed to mean` a semisolid dosage form that contains water and a gelling agent to form a gel which may contain dispersed particles and/or insoluble liquids'
intendis_gmbh v. glenmark pharm ltd. 117_f.supp.3d_549 567-68 d.del.2015

the food and drug_administrations` fda' approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluation commonly known as the orange book lists u.s. patent no._6534,070` the ¡¬070_patent` as covering finaceathe_r_gel
the ¡¬070_patent entitled` composition with azelaic acid' is assigned to appellee intraserv_gmbh & co. and exclusively licensed to appellee intendis_gmbh
the patent issued in march 2003 and claims priority to a provisional application filed on february 12 1998
sole independent_claim 1 of the ¡¬ 070 patent recites

1
a composition that comprises i azelaic_acid as a therapeutically active_ingredient in a concentration of 5_to_20 % by weight iii at least one triacylglyceride3 in a concentration of 0.big_token__5_to_5__big_token % by weight

( iv propylene glycol and
( v at least one polysorbate in an aqueous phase that further comprises water and salts and the composition further comprises
( ii at least one polyacrylic acid and
( vi lecithin wherein the composition is in the form of a hydrogel
¡¬070_patent col. 6 lines 28-39 emphases added
glenmark_pharmaceuticals_ltd. submitted an abbreviated_new_drug_application` anda' to the fda seeking to market a generic_version of finaceathe_r_gel
the submission included a paragraph iv certification pursuant to 21 u.s.c.¡± 355 j 2 a vii iv asserting that the ¡¬070_patent is invalid and not infringed
unlike finaceathe_r_gel the proposed generic_product substituted isopropyl_myristate for the claimed triglyceride and lecithin
pursuant to 21 u.s.c.¡± 355 j 2 b ii glenmark_pharmaceuticals_inc. usa informed appellees that an anda had been filed
in response appellees filed a complaint against glenmark in the united_states_district_court for the district of delaware alleging that glenmarks submission of the anda infringed the ¡¬ 070 patent under 35 u.s.c.¡± 271 e 2 a

the district_court held a markman_hearing on january 21 2015 and a five-day bench_trial from february 5-11 2015 on the issues of infringement and validity
on july_27,_2015 the district_court issued an opinion concluding that claims 1-12 of the ¡¬070_patent were infringed under the doctrine of equivalents and not invalid

with respect to infringement the central dispute was whether isopropyl_myristate *1360 in glenmarks generic_product met the claim_elements_triglyceride and lecithin under the doctrine of equivalents
the district_court found that it did relying on the function-way-result_test
the district_court rejected glenmarks arguments that infringement under the doctrine of equivalents i would encompass the prior_art and ii was barred by prosecution_history_estoppel

with respect to validity the district_court found that none of the prior_art_references raised by glenmark disclosed every element of independent_claim 1 and rejected glenmarks argument that the claims would have been obvious
prior to finaceathe_r_gel bayer marketed and sold a topical 20 % azelaic_acid cream known as skinorenthe_r which is prior_art to the ¡¬070_patent
the district_court agreed with glenmark that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would pursue a hydrogel_formulation of azelaic_acid because the skinorenthe_r formulation had undesirable qualities such as phase separation of the emulsion whitening effect and spreadability problems
however the district_court determined that glenmark failed to show by clear and convincing_evidence that a person of ordinary_skill would have been motivated to combine the prior_art_references in a manner that would render claim 1 of the ¡¬070_patent obvious
it determined that even if glenmark had glenmark failed to show a reasonable_expectation of success in making such combination
finally the district_court found that the objective_indicia of nonobviousness namely unexpected_results of the claimed formulations and commercial_success of finaceathe_r_gel weighed in favor of nonobviousness

on august 14 2015 the district_court entered a final_judgment in favor of appellees and directed the fda not to approve glenmarks anda until after the november 18 2018 expiration of the ¡¬070_patent
this appeal followed

discussion
on appeal glenmark argues that i the district_court erred in its application of the function_prong of the function-way-result_test for infringement under the doctrine of equivalents ii infringement under the doctrine of equivalents would encompass the prior_art iii appellees expressly disavowed and disclaimed a formulation without lecithin and iv the district_court erred in its obviousness analysis
we address each argument in turn

i
infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
infringement under the doctrine of equivalents is a question of fact that we review for clear_error following a bench_trial
allergan inc. v. sandoz inc. 796_f.3d_1293 1311 fed.cir.2015
even when an accused product does not meet each and every claim_element literally it may nevertheless be found to infringe the claim` if there isequivalence between the elements of the accused product or process and the claimed elements of the patented invention'
warner-jenkinson co. v. hilton davis chem co. 520_u.s._17 21 117_s.ct._1040 137_l.ed.2d_146_(1997) quoting graver_tank & mfg co. v. linde_air_prods co. 339_u.s._605 609 70_s.ct._854 94_l.ed._1097_(1950)
one way to show equivalence is by showing on an element-by-element basis that` the accused product performs substantially the same_function in substantially the same_way with substantially the same_result as each claim_limitation of the patented product' often referred to as the function-way-result_test
crown packaging tech. inc. v. rexam *1361 beverage can co. 559_f.3d_1308 1312 fed.cir.2009
each prong of the function-way-result_test is a factual_determination
in this case neither party objects to employing the function-way-result_test as a means to determine equivalency of these chemical compounds

glenmarks argument on appeal is limited to the district_courts determination that glenmarks isopropyl_myristate performed substantially the same_function as the claimed triglyceride and lecithin
we review the district_courts determination that they perform substantially the same_function a question of fact for clear_error
biovail corp. int l v. andrx pharm. inc. 239_f.3d_1297 1300 fed.cir.2001
to be clear we are not presented with the issue of the substantiality of the differences between the chemical structures of isopropyl_myristate triglyceride and lecithin
this appeal is limited to whether the district_court clearly erred when it determined that triglyceride and lecithin function as penetration_enhancers in the claimed compounds

glenmarks non-infringement argument was based on the claim_elements_triglyceride and lecithin collectively` claimed excipients' which are recited in the sole independent_claim 1
even though glenmarks generic_product did not physically contain triglyceride or lecithin the district_court found that the claimed excipients were met under the doctrine of equivalents
first the court found that isopropyl_myristate in glenmarks generic_product` glenmarks excipient' performs substantially the same_function as the claimed excipients-namely enhancing azelaic_acids penetration of the skin
it reasoned that several experts testified that the claimed excipients could act as penetration_enhancers and that` nothing in the record' indicated they could not
it also reasoned that glenmarks anda included repeated statements that both glenmarks excipient and the claimed excipients function as penetration_enhancers
it noted that glenmark` should not be permitted to liken their product to the claimed composition to support their bid for fda approval yet avoid the consequences of such a comparison for purposes of infringement'
intendis 117 f.supp.3d at 573
second the court found that glenmarks excipient performed in substantially the same_way as the claimed excipients-namely by disrupting the lipids in the skins outermost layer known as the stratum corneum
it based its finding on testimony by various experts as supported by scientific literature
third the court found that glenmarks excipient obtained substantially the same_result as the claimed excipients-namely a therapeutically effective azelaic_acid composition that is able to penetrate the skin in order to deliver the active_ingredient
it relied on data from the ¡¬070_patent glenmarks own patent application a skin penetration study and a clinical trial

on appeal glenmark argues that the district_court erred in its finding regarding the function_prong because appellees failed to prove that the claimed excipients function as penetration_enhancers in the claimed composition
it argues that` [ t ] he ¡¬070_patent itself is silent on the question of whether lecithins or triglycerides function as penetration_enhancers'
intendis 117 f.supp.3d at 572
according to glenmark this absence of support in the patent itself for the notion that the claimed excipients function as penetration_enhancers is fatal to appellees infringement_case
glenmark argues that appellees theory is also contradicted by evidence outside the *1362 patent
it points to appellees fda filings and development reports as such examples which identified the claimed lecithin and triglyceride as an emulsifier and an emollient respectively
it argues that not a single literature reference in evidence identified lecithin or triglyceride as a penetration_enhancer and appellees expert_testimony was rejected by the district_court
according to glenmark the district_court justified its finding that the claimed excipients function as penetration_enhancers on the basis that the evidence did not exclude that possibility despite the lack of any affirmative evidence

we see no clear_error in the district_courts finding of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
as an initial matter we disagree that the lack of disclosure of the claimed excipients as penetration_enhancers in the ¡¬070_patent is fatal to appellees infringement_case
we have never held that a patent must spell out a claim_elements function way and result in order for the doctrine of equivalents to apply as to that element
to the contrary we have held that` [ w ] hen the claims and specification of a patent are silent as to the result of a claim_limitation.. we should turn to the ordinary_skilled_artisan'
stumbo v. eastman outdoors inc. 508_f.3d_1358 1365 fed.cir.2007

certainly a patents disclosure is relevant and can at times be dispositive of the function
glenmark is correct that the proper analysis focuses on the claimed elements function in the claimed composition not a function that element could perform in the abstract divorced from the claimed composition
but glenmark is wrong to the extent that it argues that a determination of the claimed elements function is limited to a review of the intrinsic record
the relevant inquiry is what the claim_elements function in the claimed composition is to one of skill in the art and a fact_finder may rely on extrinsic evidence in making this factual_determination
zenith labs. inc. v. bristol-myers squibb co. 19_f.3d_1418 1425 fed.cir.1994

glenmark argues that the district_court erred in its determination that the claimed excipients function as penetration_enhancers in light of the evidence of record
we see no clear_error in this district_court fact finding
fatal to glenmarks argument is its own anda submission to the fda repeatedly referring to the claimed excipients triglyceride and lecithin as penetration_enhancers
for example glenmark stated in its filing to the fda that` [ i ] sopropyl myristate was selected as [ a ] penetration_enhancer instead of lecithin and medium chain triglyceride' under the heading` selection of penetration_enhancer'
j.a
5865
glenmarks repeated statements to the fda that the claimed excipients function as penetration_enhancers tend to show that one of skill in the art would understand the claimed excipients to function as penetration_enhancers
we see no reason why a district_court acting as a fact_finder should ignore a partys representation to a federal regulatory body that is directly on point
based on this record the district_courts finding regarding the function of the claimed excipients is not clearly erroneous

in a strange turn of events glenmark argued at oral argument to this court that its statements in its fda submissions about the claimed excipients triglyceride and lecithin functioning as penetration_enhancers should be rejected and can not be evidence to support the district_courts finding
it argued that` lecithin and triglycerides are not known to the art as *1363 penetration_enhancers' and that its representation to the fda that they do function as penetration_enhancers was a` guess' and` wrong'
oral argument at 10:49-13:38 intendis_gmbh v. glenmark pharm. inc. no.2015-1902 fed.cir
jan._8,_2016 available at http //oralarguments.cafc.uscourts.gov/default.aspx ? fl=2015-1902.mp3
these seemingly extemporaneous arguments do not persuade us that there is clear_error in the district_courts decision that isopropyl_myristate in glenmarks generic_product and the claimed triglyceride and lecithin perform substantially the same_function
no such arguments were made by glenmark in any of its briefing to this court
and when asked whether glenmark had notified the fda of these purported inaccurate representations to the fda glenmarks counsel was unaware of such notification
id.at 11:53-12:25

the district_court did not clearly err in its findings regarding the doctrine of equivalents

ii
encompassing the prior art
a patentee may not assert` a scope of equivalency that would encompass or ensnare the prior_art'
depuy_spine inc. v. medtronic sofamor danek inc. 567_f.3d_1314 1322 fed.cir.2009 quotation marks omitted
even if an accused element meets the function-way-result_test no equivalent will be found if the scope of equivalency would capture the prior_art
hypothetical_claim_analysis is a practical method to determine whether an equivalent would impermissibly ensnare the prior_art
see ultra-tex surfaces inc. v. hill bros. chem co. 204_f.3d_1360 1364 fed.cir.2000
hypothetical_claim_analysis is a two-step process
the first step is` to construct a hypothetical_claim that literally covers the accused device'
depuy_spine 567 f.3d at 1324
next prior_art introduced by the accused infringer is assessed to` determine whether the patentee has carried its burden of persuading the court that the hypothetical_claim is patentable over the prior_art'
id.at 1325
in short we ask if a hypothetical_claim can be crafted which contains both the literal claim scope and the accused device without ensnaring the prior_art
we review a district_courts conclusion that a hypothetical_claim does not encompass the prior_art de novo and resolution of underlying factual issues for clear_error
id.at 1324

the district_court determined that a proper_hypothetical_claim included the claimed excipients and glenmarks excipient namely the hypothetical_claim includes isopropyl_myristate as an alternative to the claimed triglyceride and lecithin
glenmark argued that finding infringement under the doctrine of equivalents would ensnare a prior_art reference entitled` in vitro permeation of azelaic_acid from viscosized microemulsions'` gasco' which disclosed a microemulsion containing azelaic_acid as the active_ingredient and dmso as a penetration_enhancer
the parties agreed that gasco did not disclose isopropyl_myristate lecithin or triglyceride
the district_court determined that the hypothetical_claim was not anticipated or rendered obvious by gasco and rejected glenmarks argument that finding infringement under the doctrine of equivalents would ensnare gasco
it reasoned based on expert_testimony that a skilled_artisan i would not necessarily have substituted the hypothetical_claim excipient isopropyl_myristate or lecithin and triglyceride for gascos dmso and ii would not have had a *1364 reasonable_expectation of success in doing so

glenmark argues that the district_court erred in determining that the doctrine of equivalents was not precluded by ensnarement
it argues that the district_courts hypothetical_claim was` inexplicably narrower' than appellees range of equivalents
it argues that a proper_hypothetical_claim should have matched appellees theory of infringement and thus included any penetration_enhancer
it argues that a proper_hypothetical_claim would have been anticipated by or obvious over the prior_art and thus the doctrine of equivalents should be precluded

we agree with the district_courts determination that its infringement finding under the doctrine of equivalents did not impermissibly read on the prior_art
hypothetical claims extend the actual claim to literally recite the accused product
the district_court adopted a proper_hypothetical_claim one that includes triglycerides and lecithin or alternatively isopropyl_myristate
it correctly rejected as too broad glenmarks proposed hypothetical_claim which would cover all penetration_enhancers
the district_courts infringement finding was that the excipient in glenmarks product isopropyl_myristate was equivalent to the claimed excipients lecithin and triglycerides ; it was not a finding that any penetration_enhancer would be equivalent to the claimed excipients
see graver_tank & mfg co. v. linde_air_prods co. 339_u.s._605 609 70_s.ct._854 94_l.ed._1097_(1950)` what constitutes equivalency must be determined against the context of the patent the prior_art and the particular circumstances of the case..
in determining equivalents things equal to the same thing may not be equal to each other and by the same token things for most purposes different may sometimes be equivalents`
the district_court properly rejected glenmarks argument that the hypothetical_claim must be constructed to capture all penetration_enhancers
glenmark does not challenge the district_courts determination that the hypothetical_claim as constructed would have been patentable
thus we see no reversible_error in the district_courts conclusion that gasco does not bar the application of the doctrine of equivalents to find glenmarks generic_version to infringe the asserted claims

iii
prosecution history estoppel
we have summarized the doctrine of prosecution_history_estoppel as follows [ p ] rosecution history estoppel limits the broad application of the doctrine of equivalents by barring an equivalents argument for subject_matter relinquished when a patent claim is narrowed during prosecution
we have recognized that prosecution_history_estoppel can occur during prosecution in one of two ways either 1 by making a narrowing amendment to the claim` amendment-based estoppel' or 2 by surrendering claim scope through argument to the patent examiner` argument-based estoppel'
conoco inc. v. energy & envtl
int l l.c. 460_f.3d_1349 1363 fed.cir.2006 citations omitted
with respect to the amendment-based estoppel the supreme court has explained a patentees decision to narrow his claims through amendment may be presumed to be a general disclaimer of the territory between the original claim and the amended claim
there are some *1365 cases however where the amendment can not reasonably be viewed as surrendering a particular equivalent
the equivalent may have been unforeseeable at the time of the application ; the rationale underlying the amendment may bear no more than a tangential relation to the equivalent in question ; or there may be some other reason suggesting that the patentee could not reasonably be expected to have described the insubstantial substitute in question
in those cases the patentee can overcome the presumption that prosecution_history_estoppel bars a finding of equivalence
festo corp. v. shoketsu kinzoku kogyo kabushiki co. ltd. 535_u.s._722 740-41 122_s.ct._1831 152_l.ed.2d_944_(2002)
we review de novo issues relating to the application of prosecution_history_estoppel
schwarz pharma inc. v. paddock labs. inc. 504_f.3d_1371 1375 fed.cir.2007

the district_court rejected glenmarks argument that the ¡¬070_patent applicants surrendered a lecithin-free_composition e.g. glenmarks proposed generic_product as an equivalent during prosecution
during prosecution the examiner noted that two dependent_claims which recited a lecithin` concentration of up to 1 %' and` concentration of up to 3 %' respectively could include zero lecithin
applicants responded that those range limitations clearly did not include zero because they` are only in claims dependent on independent_claims which clearly require [ lecithin ]'
j.a
4386-87 noting that the examiners argument` is not well taken`
regardless applicants amended the two dependent_claims to recite a lecithin` concentration of from more than 0_to_1 %' and` concentration of from more than 0_to_3 %' respectively noting that they were` amended to expressly state what has already been made clear on the record'
the district_court determined that` taken in context' the amendments were for clarification purposes` not to disclaim formulations with zero lecithin'
it noted that glenmark did not dispute that independent_claim 1 always required lecithin and consequently both dependent_claims also always required lecithin

glenmark argues that the district_court erred in determining that prosecution_history_estoppel did not apply to bar the doctrine of equivalents
it argues that applicants expressly disavowed and disclaimed formulations without lecithin

we see no error in the district_courts analysis
the district_court correctly determined that prosecution_history_estoppel did not preclude the capture of glenmarks lecithin-free_composition as an equivalent
argument-based estoppel only applies when the prosecution history` evince [ s ] a clear and unmistakable surrender of subject_matter'
deering precision instruments llc v. vector distrib
sys. inc. 347_f.3d_1314 1326 fed.cir.2003 citation and punctuation omitted
applicants clarifying statement` since the dependent_claims must limit the independent_claims the meaning is clear that zero amounts are not included' j.a
4387 did not clearly and unmistakably disavow claim scope to distinguish prior_art
amendment-based estoppel does not apply because the amendment was not a narrowing amendment made to obtain the patent
rather this record demonstrates that the amendment to the dependent_claims was a clarifying amendment
as dependent_claims can never be broader than the independent_claim from which they depend the dependent_claims as originally written could not have included 0 % lecithin
the amendment was as the comments themselves *1366 make clear a clarifying amendment and it does not give rise to prosecution_history_estoppel
we see no error in the district_courts determination that prosecution_history_estoppel does not apply

iv
obviousness
the district_court determined that the asserted claims would not have been obvious over the previously-marketed skinorenthe_r_cream in combination with i references disclosing formulations containing the claimed excipients` non-azelaic_acid_art' and ii references disclosing formulations containing azelaic_acid` azelaic_acid_art'4 skinorenthe_r_cream contained 20 % azelaic_acid and was marketed for skin conditions
the district_court found that skinorenthe_rs formulation had certain undesirable qualities and that a skilled_artisan would consider developing an alternative to skinorenthe_r in a different dosage form given the market forces and the deficiencies of skinorenthe_r
it also found that a skilled_artisan would have been motivated to pursue a hydrogel_formulation of azelaic_acid based on maru one of the pieces of azelaic_acid_art which the district_court found to disclose a hydrogel_formulation containing azelaic_acid
it found however that the record did not show that the artisan would have been motivated to use the claimed excipients triglyceride and lecithin
it noted that glenmarks only support to combine maru with either of the two references that disclose the claimed excipients was the testimony by glenmarks expert that a skilled_artisan` could have put.. information together from another two publications' to render claim 1 obvious
it reasoned that this cursory statement was insufficient to meet glenmarks burden of showing by clear and convincing_evidence a motivation to combine maru with other prior_art to render the claims obvious
it also found that even if glenmark had presented evidence to show motivation to combine glenmark failed to carry its burden to demonstrate a reasonable_expectation of success in making the combination
it found-based on fact and expert_testimony-that` swapping ingredients in complex chemical formulations is anything butroutine
`` j.a
65
it wrote that glenmark did not present testimony or other evidence regarding an expectation of success
it also determined that the objective_indicia of unexpected_results and commercial_success supported its conclusion of nonobviousness

glenmark argues that the district_court erred in concluding that the asserted claims would not have been obvious
it argues that a skilled_artisan would have known how to` successfully' combine the non-azelaic_acid_art with the azelaic_acid_art
it argues that the objective_indicia do not overcome its` strong' prima facie case of obviousness
according to glenmark the district_court erred in finding that the claimed compositions demonstrated unexpected_results
it also argues appellees` equivocal' evidence concerning commercial_success does not support the district_courts nonobviousness conclusion

the district_court correctly concluded that the asserted claims would not have been obvious
we discern no clear_error in the district_courts finding that a skilled_artisan would not have been motivated to combine the prior_art or in finding no reasonable_expectation of success based on *1367 the evidence of record
moreover we see no clear_error in the district_courts findings with respect to objective_indicia of nonobviousness

conclusion
the district_court did a commendable job in rendering its detailed and thorough opinion
because we see no reversible_error in the district_courts decision that glenmarks generic_product infringed the asserted claims and that the asserted claims are not invalid the district_courts judgment is affirmed

affirmed
