background
the528_patent describes and claims a hand-held convertible_vacuum/blower an implement for yard work that can be used both as a vacuum cleaner for collecting leaves and other_debris and as a blower for dispersing the same
in both modes a centrifugal fan called an impeller rotating in a housing moves air through the device in a constant direction sucking air in through an air_inlet and blowing air out through an air_outlet or exhaust
for use in vacuum cleaner mode the operator connects a vacuum tube and nozzle to the air_inlet and places a collection_bag over the air_outlet
debris is sucked into the impeller where it is mulched by action of the fan and then blown through the air_outlet into the collection_bag
for use as a blower the operator connects a directing tube to the air_outlet and places a protective cover over the air_inlet_opening to keep hands clothing and debris clear of the fan
such devices were known to the prior_art

the528_patent is directed to a vacuum/blower wherein the air velocity is adjusted depending on whether the device is used as a vacuum cleaner or as a blower
the velocity of the air during use as a blower is increased by reducing the size of the air_inlet.2 in vacuum_mode however such reduction of the air_inlet_opening is not desired for twigs and other_debris can more easily clog the inlet thus impeding operation of the device

in the device as claimed in the528_patent the cover is fitted with a ring that restricts the size of the air_inlet in blower_mode and prevents air_spill between the high_pressure_side and the low_pressure_side of the impeller_blades
as illustrated in patent figure 4 this restriction_ring 76 is attached to the air_inlet_cover which itself has apertures through which air passes

fig._4
?
*1298 in blower_mode the air_inlet_cover bearing the restriction_ring is placed on the air_inlet_opening whereby the ring reduces the total air_inlet thus optimizing operation as a blower
in vacuum_mode the air_inlet_cover is removed and replaced by the vacuum_nozzle the inlet having the larger aperture desirable for vacuum_operation
the528_patent emphasizes that by attaching the air_flow_restriction_ring to the air_inlet_cover i.e.` as part of the air_inlet_cover' the ring will always be located precisely where it is needed to automatically restrict the air_flow when the air_inlet_cover is in place

white a manufacturer of similar devices upon toros introduction of its improved model embodying the patented structure attempted to design around the528_patent
in whites design the air_inlet is also restricted by a ring that is present during operation as a blower and absent in vacuum_mode as in the528_patent
but unlike toros vacuum/blower whites restriction_ring is not attached as part of the air_inlet_cover but is a separate_part
whites ring is manually inserted into the air_inlet_opening under the cover during blower operation and removed along with the cover for vacuum_operation
whites restriction_ring is not automatically removed with whites cover but must be separately lifted out
in addition whites cover is not completely separable from the housing but swings open on a hinge
white_states that its overall design does not incorporate the invention of the528_patent and constitutes a successful attempt to design around its claims

toro charged white with infringement of claims 16_and_17 of the528_patent bracketed numerals added 16
a convertible_vacuum-blower comprising [ 1 ] a housing having an air_inlet and an air_outlet ; [ 2 ] a motor supported in said housing
[ 3 ] an impeller having a plurality of impeller_blades supported for rotary motion in said housing in fluid communication with said air_inlet and said air_outlet and rotatably driven by said motor ; [ 4 ] a removable air_inlet_cover for covering said air_inlet said air_inlet_cover having apertures for passage of air through the cover ; [ 5 ] attachment means for removably securing said air_inlet_cover to said housing ; and
[ 6 ] said cover including means for increasing the pressure developed by said vacuum-blower during operation as a blower when air is being supplied to said impeller through said apertured cover
17
a convertible_vacuum-blower in accordance with claim 16 wherein
[ 7 ] said pressure differential increasing means includes a ring carried by said cover and disposed sufficiently close to said impeller to prevent air_spill over between the high_pressure_side and low_pressure_side of said impeller_blades during rotation of said impeller
the district_court construed the claims as mandated by markman v. westview instruments inc. 517_u.s._370 116_s.ct._1384 134_l.ed.2d_577 38_uspq2d_1461_(1996)
the court then granted toros motion for summary_judgment that claim 16 of the528_patent was literally infringed by the accused devices
toro conceded that claim 17 was not literally infringed
the charge of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents was not reached during the summary proceedings

claim construction
white argues that the district_court incorrectly construed the terms` air_inlet_cover' and` attachment means for removably securing' in claim_clause [ 5 ] and` cover including means for increasing the pressure' in clause [ 6 ]
white_states that on this incorrect construction summary_judgment of infringement was improperly granted

*1299 the district_court applied the general rule that words in patent_claims are given their ordinary_meaning in the usage of the field of the invention unless the text of the patent makes clear that a word was used with a special_meaning
see multiform desiccants inc. v. medzam ltd. 133_f.3d_1473 1477 45_uspq2d_1429 1432 fed.cir.1998` it is the person of ordinary skill in the field of the invention through whose eyes the claims are construed
such person is deemed to read the words used in the patent_documents with an understanding of their meaning in the field and to have knowledge of any special_meaning and usage in the field
`` ; hoechst celanese corp. v. b.p
chems ltd. 78_f.3d_1575 1578 38_uspq2d_1126 1129 fed.cir.1996` a technical term used in a patent document is interpreted as having the meaning that it would be given by persons experienced in the field of the invention unless it is apparent from the patent and the prosecution_history that the inventor used the term with a different meaning
`` ; carroll touch inc. v. electro mechanical sys. inc. 15_f.3d_1573 1577 27_uspq2d_1836 1840 fed.cir.1993
in the528 specification no special_meaning in the field of the invention is attributed to the words` cover'` included'` attachment' and` removable'
however words of ordinary usage must nonetheless be construed in the context of the patent_documents
thus the court must determine how a person of experience in the field of this invention would upon reading the patent_documents understand the words used to define the invention

toro and white had each relied on dictionary_definitions of the common_words` cover'` attachment'` removable' and` included' each choosing definitions that favored its position
as this case well illustrates the dictionary_definitions of common_words are often less useful than the patent_documents themselves in establishing the usage of ordinary words in connection with the claimed subject matter
this is not an issue of the richness of language or variety or imprecision in the usage of words
determining the limits of a patent claim requires understanding its terms in the context in which they were used by the inventor considered by the examiner and understood in the field of the invention

in judicial` claim construction' the court must achieve the same understanding of the patent as a document whose meaning and scope have legal consequences as would a person experienced in the technology of the invention
such a person would not rely solely on a dictionary of general linguistic usage but would understand the claims in light of the specification and the prior_art guided by the prosecution_history and experience in the technologic field

a
the district_court relied on the dictionary definition of` cover' as` something that protects shelters or guards ;.. something that is placed over or about another thing' and construed` cover' as it relates to the claimed vacuum/blower as` that which functions to overlay and conceal the air_inlet and serves to guard the impeller'
white does not challenge this definition but argues that its device does not have an` attachment means' whereby its cover is` removably secured' to the housing as required by clause [ 5 ]
white_states that its cover is hinged and latched and thus is different from and not equivalent to the` attachment means for removably securing' the cover shown in the specification as a twist-lock tab and detent_system
white_states that its hinged cover is shown in a prior_art patent to mattson and suggests that the tab and detent_system was adopted by toro in order to differentiate its device from that of mattson
toro agrees that a hinged cover is shown in mattson which is mentioned in column 1 of the528_patent
however toro argues that this reference provides support for viewing the hinge as an equivalent attachment means in terms of112 ?
6

*1300 the district_court construed the` attachment means for removably securing said air_inlet_cover to said housing' of clause [ 5 ] as including the hinge of the white_device whereby the cover when lifted from the air_inlet remains attached to the housing
white points out that the cover in its device is not removable from but remains attached to the impeller housing and argues that the specification of the528_patent shows that the toro inventor did not intend to include such structures which were in the prior_art mattson patent
the district_court held that` white fails to distinguish between the cover and the attachment means
with the use of a hinge and latch the cover is removable from the housing covering the air_inlet even though the attachment means the hinge and latch are still attached to the housing'
the court held that the term` removably securing' does not require that the cover be entirely separated from the housing but simply refers to removal of the cover from the air_inlet

this question can not be decided by a dictionary
dictionaries are useful_additional_sources as is the guidance of technical/scientific experts and other relevant evidence in addition to the patent_documents themselves that may aid the judge in achieving the understanding and viewpoint of a person having experience in the field of the invention
however dictionaries provide general definitions rarely in sufficient detail to resolve close questions in particular contexts

white argues that the attachment means of clause [ 5 ] illustrated in the specification as a tab-and-detent structure does not reach the latch and hinge whereby the cover is attached to the housing and secured to the air_inlet_opening in the white_device
the district_court correctly held that it is irrelevant whether the cover in the accused device is attached to the housing for clause [ 5 ] relates only to the attachment means for removably securing the cover to the air_inlet_opening

applying112 ?
6 the district_court did not clearly err in ruling that the hinge and latch of the accused device is equivalent to the tab-and-detent illustrated in the528_patent
the use of a latch with a hinged cover is shown in the prior_art performing the identical function of securing the cover to the air_inlet during use as a blower using known interchangeable structures
cf rite-hite corp. v. kelley co. 819_f.2d_1120 1124 2_uspq2d_1915 1918 fed.cir.1987 equivalence of rack-and-pinion with ratchet-and-pawl
although white argues that section 112 ?
6 requires that the asserted equivalent is described in the specification that is an incorrect statutory interpretation for such a requirement would render the statutory provision meaningless

the district_courts interpretation of the attachment means of clause [ 5 ] is affirmed

b
white also argues that its pressure increasing means the restriction_ring is not` includ [ ed ]' in the cover as required by claim_clause [ 6 ] because the ring is not attached to the cover but is an entirely separate component
the district_court held that the term` including' correctly construed` suggests the containment of something as a component or subordinate part of a larger whole' and comprehends a separate_restriction_ring that is not part of the cover but is separately inserted and removed
the court construed` cover' to` include' both the flap that closes over the air_inlet and the restriction_ring explaining that each` overlays' and` guards' the impeller
thus the court construed clause [ 6 ] to mean that the cover includes the restriction_ring whether or not the ring is attached to the cover

the dictionary_definitions of` cover' and of` including' do not shed dispositive light on whether the phrase` cover including means for increasing the pressure' is correctly construed as requiring a mechanical attachment between the cover and the restriction_ring
whether clause [ 6 ] requires *1301 that the ring be attached to the cover is not a question of112 ?
6
it is a matter of interpretation of the words` including' and` cover' to determine whether as a matter of law the claim requires that the cover and the ring are attached to each other
the specification and drawings show the restriction_ring as` part of' and permanently attached to the cover
no other structure is illustrated or described
the specification describes the restriction_ring as` buil [ t ].. as part of the air_inlet_cover' and does not suggest that the cover and the ring may be two distinct components to be inserted and removed separately
to the contrary the specification describes the advantages of the unitary structure as important to the invention

the specification shows only a structure whereby the restriction_ring is` part of' the cover in permanent attachment
this is not simply the preferred_embodiment ; it is the only_embodiment
thus although toro argues that it is irrelevant whether the ring and the cover are one part or two in the specification toro stressed that they are one accordingly building the flow_restriction_ring as part of the air_inlet_cover on which it is needed but leaving a similarly shaped ring off the vacuum_nozzle is also advantageous in that it automatically restricts the size of air_inlet depending upon which operation is being conducted without having the operator manually insert or remove a replaceable_ring
'528_patent col. 7_lines_6 -12 citations to drawings omitted
the description of the invention states that the ring is inserted and removed` automatically' when the cover is inserted or removed
thus when the cover is closed for operation in the blower_mode the ring that is` attached to the inside of the air_inlet_cover by a plurality of screws' is thereby put into place
it is inserted simply by closing the cover ; it is removed by opening the cover

the specification does not describe an invention broader than this description of the cover and the restriction_ring` automatically' inserted and removed together
nowhere in the specification including its twenty-one drawings is the cover shown without the restriction_ring attached to it
nor is the restriction_ring shown other than attached to the cover
the specification states that the restricting ring is automatically inserted and removed by the cover to which it is attached and illustrates only this structure in the drawings
see 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.83 a` the drawing in a nonprovisional application must show every feature of the invention specified in the claims
`` ; m.p.e.p
608.02 d complete illustration in drawings
no other broader concept was described as embodying the applicants invention or shown in any of the drawings or presented for examination

the claim word` including' is not construed in a lexicographic vacuum but in the context of the specification and drawings
e.g. united states v. adams 383_u.s._39 49 86_s.ct._708 15_l.ed.2d_572_(1966)` it is fundamental that claims are to be construed in light of the specifications and both are to be read with a view to ascertaining the invention' ; smith v. snow 294_u.s._1 14 55_s.ct._279 79_l.ed._721_(1935)` if the claim were fairly susceptible to two constructions that should be adopted which will secure to the patentee his actual invention' ; abtox inc. v. exitron corp. 122_f.3d_1019 1027 43_uspq2d_1545 1551 fed.cir.1997` because the claim language as interpreted in light of the specification limits the microwave devices to a single gas-confining chamber this court affirms the district_courts grant of summary_judgment'

this is not a case of limiting the claims to a` preferred_embodiment' of an invention that has been more broadly disclosed
it is well established that the preferred_embodiment does not limit broader claims that are supported by the written description
e.g. laitram corp. v. cambridge wire cloth co. 863_f.2d_855 865 9_uspq2d_1289 1299 fed.cir.1988` references *1302 to a preferred_embodiment such as those often present in a specification are not claim limitations`
nor is this a case of limiting claims to immaterial details of a broader invention as set forth in the specification
see e.g. sri international v. matsushita electric corp. 775_f.2d_1107 1118 227_uspq_577 583 fed.cir.1985 method of operation described in specification improperly read into structural claims
no such broader invention is here described
instead the invention is described throughout the specification as it is claimed whereby the cover` includes' the ring so that the ring is inserted by closing the cover and removed by opening the cover` automatically'
there is no basis for construing` including' the ring to mean not including the ring

toro invokes the doctrine of claim_differentiation pointing to claim 17 which is specific to the restriction_ring as` carried by the cover' as supporting a broader scope for the word` including' in claim 16
white responds that there is no support in the body of the specification for such broader meaning of` including' and points out that claim 17 not only replaces` including' with` carried by' but also specifies that the restriction_ring is` disposed sufficiently close to said impeller to prevent air_spillover between the high_pressure_side and low_pressure_side of said impeller_blades'

the doctrine of claim_differentiation can shed light on the proper scope to be afforded a claim limitation for` [ t ] here is presumed to be a difference in meaning and scope when different words or phrases are used in separate claims
to the extent that the absence of such difference in meaning and scope would make a claim superfluous the doctrine of claim_differentiation states the presumption that the difference between claims is significant'
tandon corp. v. united states int l trade comm n 831_f.2d_1017 1023 4_uspq2d_1283 1288 fed.cir.1987
however the doctrine of claim_differentiation does not serve to broaden claims beyond their meaning in light of the specification see multiform desiccants inc. v. medzam ltd. 133_f.3d_1473 1480 45_uspq2d_1429 1434 fed.cir.1998 and does not override clear statements of scope in the specification and the prosecution_history
these documents require that clause [ 6 ] be construed to mean that the restriction_ring is permanently affixed to and included as part of the cover
on this construction the claims can not be literally infringed by a device having a separate_restriction_ring that is inserted and removed as a separate_part

the summary_judgment of literal_infringement is reversed

the doctrine of equivalents
toro argues that even if there is not literal_infringement there is infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
toro states that white has merely separated into two components that which the patentee achieved with one
see e.g. richardson v. suzuki motor co. 868_f.2d_1226 1239 9_uspq2d_1913 1923 fed.cir.1989

the court did not reach the question of whether the use of separate components for cover and ring would nonetheless infringe under the doctrine of equivalents
on this factual question of equivalency material facts were in dispute
we remand for determination of this issue

no costs

reversed and remanded

rader circuit_judge dissenting
the court today determines that the verb` include' in the528_patent requires an` attachment relationship'
however the courts interpretation of` including' can not be justified by examination of the ordinary_meaning of that word or of its accepted use in patent_claims or especially by a careful_reading of the528_patent

it is axiomatic that terms in a claim must be given their ordinary_meaning unless it is apparent that the inventor used them differently in the patent
intellicall *1303 inc. v. phonometrics inc. 952_f.2d_1384 1387 fed.cir.1992
while the court acknowledges that` [ d ] ictionaries are useful_additional_sources' it did not consult one to establish the ordinary_meaning of` include' a procedure suggested by hoganas ab v. dresser indus. inc. 9_f.3d_948 951 fed.cir.1993
when the parties themselves consulted dictionaries both emerged with similar definitions of` include' incorporating the concept of` take in or comprise as a whole'
combining this modern definition with the origin of` include' in the latin inclaudere to shut in confine within or hold as in an enclosure blacks law dictionary 6th ed
( 1990 leaves no doubt that the ordinary_meaning of` include' does not require physical attachment
*

in patent_claims` including' is normally a comprehensive term used in a way similar to` having' or` comprising'
john landis mechanics of patent claim drafting section 7
in a claim element use of the forms` comprising'` having' or` including' commonly means that whatever element is comprised had or included is not necessarily the only element encompassed by the subject of the clause that contains that verb
see robert c. faber the winning mechanical claim 426 pli/p 231 353 1995
`` including' in a claim thus signifies a relationship broader than` attachment'
in the invention of the528_patent the concept of the flow restrictor which allows the user to adjust the air_flow during the blower_mode of operation is original
'528_patent col._2,_ll._29-32
thus the choice of the word` including' was appropriate to give the applicant the broad coverage sought and deserved for his original concept

finally a careful_reading of the528_patent also demonstrates that` including' does not here require attachment
the court mistakenly takes the described embodiment to be unique inferring that the specification teaches that embodiment alone
the court notes that` [ t ] he specification shows only a structure whereby cover and ring are permanently attached to each other
this was not simply the preferred_embodiment ; it was the only_embodiment'
on the contrary the specification does not claim such uniqueness and describes another embodiment specifically one in which the flow_restriction_ring is not permanently attached to the cover
everywhere the word` embodiment' is used to denote what is described in the specification of the528_patent it is used in the phrase` a preferred_embodiment'
more important the inventor contrasts the preferred_embodiment not as the court thinks with disadvantageous prior_art but rather with a less-preferred_embodiment of the invention at hand a blower with a replaceable i.e. non-attached ring
as the inventor states the method of construction of the preferred_embodiment in which the flow_restriction_ring is indeed built into and thus` part of' the air_inlet_cover is advantageous in that` it automatically restricts the size of air_inlet.. without having the operator manually insert or remove a replaceable_ring'
'528_patent col. 7 ll.6-12
but as noted above there is no prior_art for the flow_restriction_ring so that such a ring in any form was part of the invention
in particular an owner-replaceable_ring i.e. one not attached was clearly part of the invention and is described by element [ 6 ] of claim 16 of the528_patent
in short an` included' but definitely not` attached' flow_restriction_ring is a feature of an embodiment of *1304 the invention but not the preferred_embodiment

the term` including' in the context of the528_patent does not imply` attachment' and the claims of this patent should not be limited to the preferred_embodiment with its attached restricting ring
