rader circuit_judge
on summary_judgment the united_states_district_court for the southern_district of ohio found trintec_industries inc.s united states patent no._5818,717 ¡¬717_patent invalid as inherently anticipated
trintec indus
v. top-u.s.a._corp. no
c-2-99-1179 s.d.ohio jun._19,_2001
because the ¡¬ 717 patent is not inherently anticipated this court_vacates and remands

i. trintec is the assignee of the ¡¬717_patent
the inventor brendon g. nunes *1294 filed the ¡¬717_patent application on june_2,_1993
the ¡¬ 717 patent_claims a cost-effective method of producing in low_volume multicolor_faces for watches clocks thermometers and other_instruments
the method includes making a graphic instrument_face in a computer transmitting electronic_signals from the computer to a color_printer or photocopier printing the face on sheet_material cutting it and assembling it into an instrument

top-u.s.a
corporation produces watches and clocks with customized faces and has done so for over eighteen years
initially top created and printed its customized graphics using pad printing engraving silk screening or photography
those methods were expensive and required extensive set-up time
thus these older methods were ill-suited to small-volume custom design and printing
desktop publishings advent in the late 1980s mitigated the design side of this problem but high-resolution color printing remained prohibitively expensive
with color laser printer advances however top was using that technology to make custom watches and clocks by 1995

sweda company llc also is in the customized watch business
in a 1991-92 catalogue sweda_catalogue sweda advertised the availability at an inexpensive price of small-volume multi-color watches produced by` a new computer_laser_printer'
the sweda_catalogue was not before the examiner of the ¡¬717_patent during its prosecution

on november 2 1999 trintec asserted the ¡¬717_patent against top in the district_court
trintec alleged that top infringed independent_claims 3_and_8 and associated dependent_claims 4-5 12 and 13
trintec filed a motion for summary_judgment of infringement intentional infringement and validity
top filed a cross-motion for summary_judgment that the asserted claims either were anticipated or obvious in view of the sweda_catalogue
the district_court found that the sweda_catalogue inherently anticipated the asserted claims and granted summary_judgment of invalidity
having determined that prior_art anticipated the ¡¬717_patent the district_court did not reach obviousness and dismissed the case with prejudice
trintec appeals the district_courts summary_judgment of invalidity
this court has jurisdiction under 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1 2000

ii
this court reviews a district_courts grant of summary_judgment without deference
johns hopkins univ
v. cellpro inc. 152_f.3d_1342 1353 47_uspq2d_1705 1713 fed.cir.1998
this court also reviews without deference questions of claim_construction
cybor corp. v. fas techs. inc. 138_f.3d_1448 1454 46_uspq2d_1169 1174 fed.cir.1998 en banc
novelty or anticipation is a question of fact
akzo n.v. v. united states int l trade comm n 808_f.2d_1471 1_uspq2d_1241_(fed.cir.1986)
therefore a district_court properly may grant summary_judgment on this identity question only when the record discloses no genuine material factual issues

because noveltys identity requirement applies to claims not specifications constant v. advanced micro-devices inc. 848_f.2d_1560 7_uspq2d_1057 1064 fed.cir.1988 the anticipation inquiry first demands a proper claim_construction
claim language defines claim scope
sri int l v. matsushita elec corp. 775_f.2d_1107 1121 227_uspq_577 586 fed.cir.1985 en banc
as a general rule claim_language carries the ordinary meaning of the words in their normal usage in the field of invention
toro co. v. white consol
indus. 199_f.3d_1295 1299 53_uspq2d_1065 1067 fed.cir.1999
nevertheless *1295 the inventor may act as his own lexicographer and use the specification to supply implicitly or explicitly new meanings for terms
markman v. westview instruments inc. 52_f.3d_967 979-80 34_uspq2d_1321 1330 fed.cir.1995 en banc affd 517_u.s._370 116_s.ct._1384 134_l.ed.2d_577_(1996)
thus a construing court may consult as well the written description and if in evidence the prosecution history
id

a single prior_art reference anticipates a patent_claim if it expressly or inherently describes each and every limitation set forth in the patent_claim
verdegaal bros. inc. v. union oil co. 814_f.2d_628 631 2_uspq2d_1051 1053 fed.cir.1987
inherent anticipation requires that the missing descriptive material is` necessarily present' not merely probably or possibly present in the prior_art
in re_robertson 169_f.3d_743 745 49_uspq2d_1949 1950-51 fed.cir.1999 citing continental can co. usa inc. v. monsanto co. 948_f.2d_1264 1268 20_uspq2d_1746 1749 fed.cir.1991

in this case the district_court determined that the sweda_catalogue anticipated or disclosed and enabled each and every element of the claimed invention
the sweda_catalogue advertises three different methods of making customized watches a` full color watch rendering' method a` mock-up sample' method and a` speculative sample' method
the catalogue states that the first two methods use a computer_laser_printer and the` speculative samples' method uses silk-screening hot stamping color process/offset printing etchograph stamping or engraving
the catalogue then shows images of color watch faces made with each of the advertised methods
all three methods require the customer to submit` camera ready color separated artwork' i.e. separate pieces of black and white artwork representing each color in the design

top concedes that the sweda_catalogue does not teach expressly all limitations of the asserted claims
hence the only issue for this court to determine is whether the claim limitations not taught expressly by the sweda_catalogue are nevertheless disclosed inherently
this inherent_anticipation question implicates claims 3_and_8
claim 3 recites in relevant_part 3
a method of constructing a functional_multicolor_element having indicia_thereon utilizing a computer and a color_photocopier comprising the steps of a electronically creating or providing in the computer an electronic_simulation of the desired functional_multicolor_element with indicia_thereon ; b under the control of the computer transmitting electronic_signals from the computer to the photocopier so that the photocopier transforms the electronic_simulation of the desired functional_multicolor_element onto a piece of sheet_material.. col._7,_ll._16-26 emphases added

the district_court construed the term` color_photocopier' to mean a` color_printer'
the district_court noted that the sweda_catalogue expressly advertises` a color picture of your customers custom logo produced by our new advanced computer_laser_printer'
based on this the district_court determined that the sweda_catalogue inherently disclosed a color_printer because` those in the graphic arts industry would have recognized that a color printing device is necessarily present in the catalogues description of a full color rendering produced from acomputer_laser_printer
`` nevertheless a color_printer is not a color_photocopier

the ¡¬717_patent specification teaches that a` major component' of the invention *1296` is a printer preferably a color_photocopier'
col._3,_ll._62-64
at the same time the patent also recognizes that a color_photocopier does more than print in color it copies
specifically the specification teaches` photocop [ ying ] with a color_photocopier such as of the types earlier described'
col._6,_ll._20-21
the undisputed trial testimony of dr. steven j. bares underscores this point` digital color copiers comprise a digital color scanner and a digital_color_laser_printer which are directly connected together so that graphics transformed into digital information through the scanner are transmitted to the digital_color_laser_printer for printing'
as a matter of correct claim_construction therefore a` color_photocopier' requires the ability both to print and photocopy subject matter with color

the difference between a printer and a photocopier may be minimal and obvious to those of skill in this art
nevertheless obviousness is not inherent_anticipation
jones v. hardy 727_f.2d_1524 1529 220_uspq_1021 1025 fed.cir.1984` though anticipation is the epitome of obviousness [ they ] are separate and distinct concepts'
given the strict identity required of the test for novelty on this record no reasonable_jury could conclude that the sweda_catalogue discloses either expressly or inherently a color_photocopier
because claim 3 is not inherently anticipated dependent_claims 4_and_5 also are not anticipated

claim 8 recites in relevant_part 8
a method of producing an instrument_face having functional_indicia_thereon utilizing a computer and printer comprising the steps of a creating the instrument_face with functional_indicia_thereon in the computer in electronic_format.. col._8,_ll._1-5 emphases added
while claim 3 has the broader language` creating or providing' claim 8 recites only` creating'
nonetheless the district_court interpreted both claims to require` creating or providing in a computer a multicolor logo and hour markings to comprise the face of an instrument'
( emphasis added
the district_court found that the sweda_catalogue inherently anticipated` creating or providing' as required by its claim_construction
because claim 8 requires` creating' rather than` creating or providing' the district_court erred in its construction of that claim and in its corresponding determination of inherent_anticipation

the ¡¬717_patent does not define expressly` creating' or` providing'
the two terms however have distinct meanings
each term appears in claim_language
each therefore imparts a different scope to the claim in which it appears
see e.g. unique concepts inc. v. brown 939_f.2d_1558 1562 19_uspq2d_1500 1503 fed.cir.1991` the fact that mitered linear_border_pieces meet to form a right angle corner does not make them right angle corner pieces when the claim separately recites both linear_border_pieces and right angle corner border pieces
``

in its teachings the specification treats the two terms differently
for example with respect to preparing an instrument_face for printing the specification describes a two step process` the artwork.. is created in electronic_format in the computer
information may initially be inputted into the computer for this purpose from a conventional scanner or a cd_rom'
col._4,_ll._7-11 emphasis added
in sum the patent recognizes that information may be provided input into the computer after creation elsewhere or alternatively may be created in the computer from scratch
regarding the creating step the specification further teaches that` commercially available software programs' may be used to` produce almost *1297 any design desired on an instrument_face'
col._4,_ll._11-14 18
in view of these teachings this court construes` creating' to require more than simply using the computer as a conduit to convey information to the printer from a scanner or a cd_rom
creating requires rather a substantive_addition or modification of the artwork in the computer such as when graphics_software adds a design to an instrument_face

the sweda_catalogue discloses as discussed above various printing methods
these printing methods disclose nothing about creating artwork in a computer
for this reason the sweda_catalogue does not inherently anticipate claim 8
specifically the sweda_catalogue may well have created instrument_faces with conventional manual methods
then after manual creation or assembly the sweda_catalogue may have provided those faces to a computer only for printing
indeed the sweda_catalogue required expressly that its customers provide color_separations of their artwork
the record suggests that those of skill in this art use color_separations to create manually a composite_color rendering of the desired image
then a black and white laser printer makes separate transparent color sheets based on the color_separations
finally the artisans overlay the separate color sheets manually to form a composite_color rendering of the desired image
this process requires no substantive_addition or modification of the artwork in the computer-as mandated by a correct reading of the term` create'
in other words the process suggested by the sweda_catalogue combines the color sheets outside of the computer with the computer serving merely as a conduit for printing
it is irrelevant that a skilled artisan might possibly use the computer to create the final desired image from the color_separations
inherency does not embrace probabilities or possibilities
in re_robertson 169_f.3d_743 745 49_uspq2d_1949 1951 fed.cir.1999
in sum no reasonable_jury could find that the sweda_catalogue anticipates either expressly or inherently this claim

cases involving novelty with its strict identity requirement are quite rare
obviousness seems the actual issue here
this court however can not reach that question without a fully developed record
obviousness involves for instance questions of suggestion to combine see e.g. in re rouffet 149_f.3d_1350 47_uspq2d_1453_(fed.cir.1998) and objective indicators of patentability see e.g. graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 17-18 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966)
on appeal this court can not venture into these factual and complex areas without a developed record
accordingly this record requires remand to permit the trial court to apply the obviousness standards in light of the sweda_catalogue and other prior_art as viewed with the knowledge of one of skill in the art at the time of invention

conclusion
because the district_court erred in granting summary_judgment that claims 3-5 8 12 and 13 are inherently anticipated this court_vacates and remands for a determination on the issue of obviousness and other proceedings consistent with this opinion
