opinion
mayer chief_judge
gary e. rhine appeals the judgment of the united_states_district_court for the northern_district of ohio case no._96 cv7524 which granted casio inc. and casio_computer_co. ltd. collectively` casio' summary_judgment of noninfringement
because the court improperly construed the claim we reverse the judgment and remand the case

*1344 background
rhine owns u.s. patent no._4910,652 which is directed to a wrist_watch containing a flashlight having a time_delay_circuit
the time_delay_circuit turns the flashlight off after a set period of time
the only asserted claim claim 1 recites` a time keeping and displaying wrist mountable watch having a flashlight mounted in the case thereof said flashlight comprising a power_supply for supplying electrical power to said flashlight said power_supply electrically connected to at least one light_source and time_delay means for automatically extinguishing said light_source after a time_delay following the energization of said light_source by the electrical deenergization of said light_source'
because casio sells and/or manufactures a wrist_watch whose face illuminates with sufficient brightness to light up an area beyond the watch_face itself rhine sued it for infringement of claim 1

following an initial settlement conference the court ordered rhine to file a motion to construe the claim purporting to follow the procedure suggested by markman v. westview instruments inc. 517_u.s._370 116_s.ct._1384 134_l.ed.2d_577_(1996)
in the statement of claim interpretation submitted to the court rhine argued that claim 1 covers a wrist_watch having 1 a light_source capable of illuminating more than the watch_face and 2 a time-delayed extinguishment of the light_source
rhine also explained that casio infringes the claim so construed
in response casio argued that the claim should be construed to cover only a wrist_watch having two separate and distinct light_sources-one that illuminates the watch_face and one that illuminates an area beyond the face
casio also moved for summary_judgment of invalidity arguing that if claim 1 covers a watch having a single_light_source then it is invalid as obvious because the prior_art discloses 1 a watch whose face_illuminator is bright enough to illuminate more than the watch_face and 2 a time_delay_circuit for face_illuminators

`` because of th [ e ] limiting prior_art' the court construed claim 1` as covering a flashlight that is distinct from the light_source that illuminates the face of the watch in combination with a time_delay device that automatically extinguishes the flashlight'
this limiting prior_art includes a japanese_reference which discloses` a wristwatch having an illumination lamp for lighting a time display unit and for providing illumination outside of the casing'
in addition the patent and trademark office noted during prosecution that` both mounting search lights and flashlights on a users wrist and enabling users to check the time by means of watch dial illumination were known in the prior_art although not in combination'
the court reasoned that because the japanese_reference discloses a single illumination source capable of illuminating both the watch_face and an area surrounding the watch_face the flashlight_limitation of claim 1 could not be construed to cover this type of single_light_source

the court denied casios motion for summary_judgment of invalidity however because there are genuine issues of material fact about whether the claim as construed is obvious over the prior_art
casio then filed a motion for summary_judgment of noninfringement arguing that its light_source was not distinct from the one illuminating the watch_face
based on its claim_construction and the undisputed evidence about the accused products design and operation the court granted casio summary_judgment of noninfringement
this appeal followed

discussion
we review a district_courts decision to grant summary_judgment de novo
see gasser chair co. v. infanti chair mfg
*1345 corp. 60_f.3d_770 773 34_u.s.p.q.2d_1822 1824 fed.cir.1995
`` where the parties do not dispute any relevant facts regarding the accused product.. but disagree over possible claim interpretations the question of literal infringement collapses into [ one of ] claim_construction and is amenable to summary_judgment'
general mills inc. v. hunt-wesson inc. 103_f.3d_978 983 41_u.s.p.q.2d_1440 1444 fed.cir.1997 ; see also athletic alternatives inc. v. prince mfg. inc. 73_f.3d_1573 1578 37_u.s.p.q.2d_1365 1370 fed.cir.1996 the de novo standard applies to our review of claim_construction
see cybor corp. v. fas techs. inc. 138_f.3d_1448 1455-56 46_u.s.p.q.2d_1169 1173-74 fed.cir.1998 en banc

in construing claim 1 the district_court ostensibly applied the familiar axiom that` [ c ] laims should be so construed if possible as to sustain their validity'
carman indus. inc. v. wahl 724_f.2d_932 937_n._5 220_u.s.p.q._481 485 n.5 fed.cir.1983 ; see also acs hosp sys. inc. v. montefiore hosp. 732_f.2d_1572 1577 221_u.s.p.q._929 932 fed.cir.1984
this axiom traces its origins to two supreme court cases turrill v. michigan southern & northern indiana railroad 68 u.s. 1 wall
491 17_l.ed._668_(1863) and klein v. russell 86 u.s. 19 wall
433 22_l.ed._116_(1873)
turrill explains that patents` are to receive a liberal construction and under the fair application of the rule ut res magis valeat quam pereat are if practicable to be so interpreted as to uphold and not to destroy the right of the inventor'
68 u.s. at 510 emphasis added
klein further refines this rule explaining that courts` should proceed in a liberal spirit so as to sustain the patent and the construction claimed by the patentee himself if this can be done consistently with the language which he has employed'
86 u.s. at 466 emphasis added
the court has consistently limited the axiom to cases where the construction is` practicable' and does not conflict with the explicit language of the claim

we too have consistently employed the caveat` if possible' to our instruction that claims should be construed to sustain their validity
see e.g. whittaker corp. v. unr indus. inc. 911_f.2d_709 712 15_u.s.p.q.2d_1742 1744 fed.cir.1990` [ c ] laims are generally construed so as to sustain their validity if possible`
we have also admonished against judicial rewriting of claims to preserve validity
see becton dickinson & co. v. c.r
bard inc. 922_f.2d_792 799 & n. 6 17_u.s.p.q.2d_1097 1102 & n.6 fed.cir.1990
therefore if the only claim_construction that is consistent with the claims language and the written description renders the claim invalid then the axiom does not apply and the claim is simply invalid

in the case before us the court misapplied the axiom and adopted a construction of` flashlight' that is at odds with the clear language of the claim and the written description
in holding that the recited` flashlight.. is distinct from the light_source that illuminates the face of the watch' the court construed the claim to require at least two light_sources-one that illuminates an area beyond the watch_face and one that illuminates only the watch_face a face_illuminator
however claim 1 recites a flashlight comprising` at least one light_source'
( emphasis added
use of the phrase` at least one' means that there could be only one or more than one
see kistler instrumente ag
v. united states 628_f.2d_1303 1318 211_u.s.p.q._920_(ct.cl.1980)` anyone with even the most rudimentary understanding of the english language understandsat least one piezo-electric crystal means lodged within said component means to mean one or more crystals`
therefore the courts construction is contrary to the plain language of the claim

*1346 to give meaning to the phrase` at least one light_source' we must construe claim 1 to cover a device that has only one light_source or a device that has more than one light_source assuming that the` device' is a` flashlight' as that term is used in the claim
according to the written description the flashlight 8 is a light that is bright enough` to illuminate a small room or to otherwise serve satisfactorily as a flashlight'
col._2,_ll._46-53
the face_illuminator 9 in contrast is a light that` enable [ s ] reading the time without turning on [ the flashlight ] 8 if desired'
col._2,_ll._58-62
according to the written description the flashlight 8 and the face_illuminator 9 are different elements
however the written description further explains that light from the flashlight 8 can be used to illuminate the watch_face 4 in the absence of a distinct face_illuminator
see col._2,_ll._49-54` [ t ] he brightness of lamps 8 and the disposition of lamps 8 about case 3 should be arranged to illuminate timepiece face 4 so that the watch hands can be seen in the absence of otherwise provided light and so that the time indicative numbers and dots are also then visible`
therefore properly construed the flashlight_limitation is met by a wrist_watch whose only light_source illuminates both the watch_face and a significant area beyond the watch_face
this definition is consistent with the terms ordinary meaning
see american heritage dictionary 511 2d college ed.1982 defining` flashlight' as a` small portable lamp usually powered by batteries'

casio argues that the claim can not cover a watch without a separate face_illuminator because the preferred embodiment includes one
however` particular embodiments appearing in a specification will not be read into the claims when the claim language is broader than such embodiments'

s.a. v. cooper life sciences 34_f.3d_1048 1054 32_u.s.p.q.2d_1017 1021 fed.cir.1994
because claim 1 does not recite a face_illuminator it is broader than the embodiment referenced by casio
moreover because the written description does not require that the watch include a face_illuminator this` limitation should not be read from the specification into the claim [ ]'
specialty composites v. cabot corp. 845_f.2d_981 987 6_u.s.p.q.2d_1601 1605 fed.cir.1988

casio also argues that under our construction claim 1 is invalid because the recited combination is obvious
this argument is premature
casio can not avoid a full-blown validity_analysis by raising the specter of invalidity during the claim_construction phase
although the court appeared to believe that several pieces of prior_art when viewed in combination disclose all the limitations of claim 1 it did not conduct a validity_analysis
see graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 17-18 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966)
specifically it did not identify any motivation to combine the references see in re fine 837_f.2d_1071 1074 5_u.s.p.q.2d_1596 1598-99 fed.cir.1988 or consider objective evidence of nonobviousness see custom accessories inc. v. jeffrey-allan indus. inc. 807_f.2d_955 960 1_u.s.p.q.2d_1196 1199 fed.cir.1986
moreover rhine alleges that he was denied the opportunity to conduct discovery on the secondary considerations
therefore we remand the case so that discovery can proceed if necessary and the court may fully evaluate the strength of the invalidity case

conclusion
accordingly the judgment of united_states_district_court for the northern_district of ohio is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion
