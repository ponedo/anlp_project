markey chief_judge

) upholding the validity of u.s. patent no._3485,383383 owned by the manitowoc company inc. manitowoc finding the383_patent not infringed by fmc corporation fmc and resolving the issues raised by fmcs claims of inequitable_conduct attorney_fees antitrust violation and unfair_competition in favor of manitowoc
we affirm

background
on september 5 1980 fmc sued for a judgment declaring that its heavy lift cranes did not infringe the383_patent that the patent was invalid and unenforceable and that manitowocs maintenance and threatened enforcement of the patent constituted unfair_competition because fmc was forced to` design around' the patent procured through inequitable_conduct
manitowoc then sued fmc for infringement and fmc counterclaimed alleging violation of the antitrust_laws
the two cases were not formally consolidated but were treated and tried together

proceedings encompassed over six years in the district_court and involved participation for varying periods of two magistrates and four district judges
the case including pretrial skirmishes generated over 1000 entries on 80 docket pages
the record exceeded 17,000 pages

on january 30 1987 after conducting six weeks of trial hearing numerous witnesses and rendering many rulings judge_hart entered a comprehensive 60- *1413 page set of clearly stated findings and conclusions in which he incorporated his evaluations of the evidence and his reasoning and to which he appended drawings admitted as exhibits
fmc_corp. v. manitowoc_co. 654_f.supp._915 2_uspq2d_1969_(n.d.ill.1987)1 the invention the issues and the actions and contentions of the parties in this case are thoroughly set forth in the above-cited reports
familiarity therewith is presumed and discussion here is limited to facts involved in disposition of this appeal

issues
( 1 whether the district_court abused its discretion in denying attorney_fees

( 2 whether the district_court erred in resolving the antitrust issues against fmc

( 3 whether the district_court erred in resolving the unfair_competition issues against fmc

opinion
the appeal
fmc says it appeals from the portions of the judgment that hold the383_patent enforceable deny its request for attorney_fees and reject its unfair_competition and antitrust_claims
though fmc charges the district_court with a niagara of legal_error on a plethora of issues the appeal turns primarily on whether the district_court correctly determined that manitowoc was not guilty of inequitable_conduct when it prosecuted its patent application twenty years ago

manitowoc did not appeal from the portion of the judgment based on the finding of noninfringement and the383_patent has expired
the validity and enforceability issues argued by the parties are thus twice mooted.2 as discussed below fmc can not prevail unless it can show that the district_court erred in determining that it did not carry its burden of proving by clear and convincing_evidence j.p._stevens & co. v. lex tex ltd. 747_f.2d_1553 1559 223_uspq_1089 1092 fed.cir.1984 cert
denied 474_u.s._822 106_s.ct._73 88_l.ed.2d_60_(1985) facts requiring a determination that manitowoc was guilty of inequitable_conduct.3

fmcs brief says` the record suggests that the district_court had difficulty understanding both the technical and legal issues before it'
a study of the full record however indicates that fmc simply failed to carry its burden of persuading the court to adopt the` understanding' fmc sought.4

with no citation of applicable authority fmc insists that judge_hart was bound by earlier_rulings of other judicial officers in the case relating to its charge of inequitable_conduct.5 fmcs initial brief calls those rulings` decisions' and` earlier findings and conclusions'
manitowocs brief correctly points out that 1 the rulings were on motions ; 2 fmcs motion to have them declared` law of the case' was denied ; 3 judge_hart not only did not` ignore' *1414 the earlier_rulings as fmc says he did but warned that the entire case would be tried de novo ; 4 fmc succeeded in discovering documents but failed to carry its burdens of proof in live testimony at trial before an experienced judge ; 5 fmc has not shown how the rulings on motions could be said to require another trial ; 6 no final judgment having been entered before trial judge_hart would not be bound by any earlier_rulings of any kind if he had made them himself ; and 7 it would have been error to have treated discovery orders as summary judgments
in its reply brief fmc simply ignores all that
fmcs argument is specious

fmc attacks no finding as clearly erroneous under rule 52 a fed.r.civ.p
it demands a new_trial because of alleged legal_error in claim_interpretation in considering fewer than all the claims in evaluating the materiality of documents fmc calls` the prior_art' in applying variable standards of enablement in finding the invention not on sale because it was not reduced to practice until after the critical_date and in failing to decide the issue of anticipation
fmc says it` asks for a new_trial because there is prejudicial error in virtually every legal_conclusion the district_court reached' citing w.l
gore & associates inc. v. garlock inc. 721_f.2d_1540 1547 220_uspq_303 308 fed.cir.1983 findings based on error of law may be set aside cert
denied 469_u.s._851 105_s.ct._172 83_l.ed.2d_107_(1984)
fmc nowhere argues that it was denied full opportunity to try its case or was impeded in presenting evidence or was confronted with inadmissible evidence or that the trial was in any other manner unfair

manitowoc says fmc distorts the record and the findings cites only parts of the evidence misrepresents other parts of the evidence assumes facts favorable to fmc mischaracterizes judge_harts findings and conclusions does not even attempt to show that any error was prejudicial fails to show that the evidence would justify a contrary result and has from the beginning made numerous reckless charges many now dropped and others continued without support in the record

having read and re-read the briefs and conducted the record research necessitated by the many issues raised and assertions made this court is led to the realization that the sound and fury characterizing the briefs relates primarily to issues nondispositive of the appeal
hence we need not lengthen this opinion with a discussion of those issues
nor is it necessary that we determine on which if either side the angels reside

( 1 attorney fees
fmc does not mention the district_courts discretion but says its request for attorney_fees should have been granted because a manitowocs infringement_claim was frivolous ; and b manitowoc was guilty of inequitable_conduct when it failed to disclose certain_documents and information to the patent and trademark office pto during prosecution of the application that resulted in the383_patent
neither basis is supported by the record

( a infringement claim
nothing in the record would have supported a finding that manitowoc did not legitimately believe in the merits of its infringement allegation at trial
fmcs motion for partial summary judgment of noninfringement was denied on october 29 1982 indicating that the issue was appropriate for trial
fmcs assertion that manitowocs infringement_claim was frivolous is without merit

( b inequitable conduct
fmc vigorously attacks on what it calls` legal grounds' the district_courts determinations that manitowocs own documents q-1064_proposal and beduhn_speech were conceptual incomplete nonenabling6 and thus not material and that the claimed invention was not` on sale' before the *1415 critical_date
manitowoc cites the record in defense of those determinations
that dispute relates only to materiality and need not here be addressed in detail for a determination of inequitable_conduct requires findings on materiality and intent and the district_court here found the intent element totally absent` even if' the documents were regarded as pertinent_prior_art.7

there is no evidence of any intent to withhold any information from the patent office or to withhold evidence known to be material and controlling even if the documents are regarded as pertinent_prior_art
the record does not support a finding of inequitable_conduct on the part of the inventor or any manitowoc representative
654 f.supp.at 930 2 uspq2d at 1979
( emphasis added
there is no basis for findings of` materiality'` gross_negligence' or` intent to deceive' which would support a conclusion of inequitable_conduct
654 f.supp.at 935 2 uspq2d at 1983
`` inequitable_conduct' is not or should not be a magic incantation to be asserted against every patentee
nor is that allegation established upon a mere showing that art or information having some degree of materiality was not disclosed
to be guilty of inequitable_conduct one must have intended to act inequitably
thus one who alleges a` failure to disclose' form of inequitable_conduct must offer clear and convincing proof of 1 prior_art or information that is material ; 2 knowledge chargeable to applicant8 of that prior_art or information and of its materiality ; and 3 failure of the applicant to disclose the art or information resulting from an intent to mislead the pto
that proof may be rebutted by a showing that a the prior_art or information was not material e.g. because it is less pertinent than or merely cumulative with prior_art or information cited to or by the pto ; b if the prior_art or information was material a showing that applicant did not know of that art or information ; c if applicant did know of that art or information a showing that applicant did not know of its materiality ; d a showing that applicants failure to disclose art or information did not result from an intent to mislead the pto

thus a balancing of overlapping considerations is involved in determining in view of all the circumstances the presence or absence of inequitable_conduct
the level of materiality may be high or low
applicant must be chargeable with knowledge of the existence of the prior_art or information for it is impossible to disclose the unknown
cf
american_hoist & derrick_co. v. sowa & sons inc. 725_f.2d_1350 1362 220_uspq_763 772 fed.cir
( no duty to search cert
denied 469_u.s._821 105_s.ct._95 83_l.ed.2d_41_(1984)
similarly an applicant must be chargeable with knowledge of the materiality of the art or information ; yet an applicant who knew of the art or information can not intentionally avoid learning of its materiality through gross_negligence i.e. it may be found that the applicant` should have known' of that materiality.9

*1416 considerations touching materiality and applicants knowledge thereof overlap those touching applicants intent because of inferences of intent that may be drawn from the former ; yet intent is a question of fact kangaroos u.s.a. inc. v. caldor inc. 778_f.2d_1571 1573 228_uspq_32 33 fed.cir.1985 and an applicant who knew or should have known of the art or information and of its materiality is not automatically precluded thereby from an effort to convince the fact finder that the failure to disclose was nonetheless not due to an intent to mislead the pto ; i.e. that in light of all the circumstances of the case an inference of intent to mislead is not warranted.10 no single factor or combination of factors can be said always to require an inference of intent to mislead ; yet a patentee facing a high level of materiality and clear proof that it knew or should have known of that materiality can expect to find it difficult to establish` subjective_good_faith' sufficient to prevent the drawing of an inference of intent to mislead
a mere denial of intent to mislead which would defeat every effort to establish inequitable_conduct will not suffice in such circumstances
nonetheless when as here the district_court finds on all the evidence that an applicant had no knowledge of materiality that that lack of knowledge was not due to gross_negligence and that applicant had no intent to mislead the pto the burden on an appellant attempting to overturn those findings is not met by mere argument that undisclosed art or information known to the applicant was material

fmc says the district_courts refusal to infer an intent means the court was insisting on a` smoking gun' or an outright confession and despite the courts reference to` gross_negligence' fmc says it did not apply a` should have known' test
the contrary is true
judge_hart cited and applied the guidance on the law set forth in the precedents of this court on the issue and reached his determination only after he found the testimony of fmc witness van de hey incredible ; randolph did give the pto what was understood to be the prior_art ; neither randolph nor beduhn believed the q-1064_proposal and beduhn_speech were` printed publications' describing the invention or that a ringer could be` on sale' before it came into existence ; butterworths deal was not and was not seen as an offer for sale ; and the first ringer was assembled tested and significantly modified after the critical_date

rule 52 a applies to those findings and their correctness is not challenged by fmc
they can not be overturned by merely asserting legal_error in the refusal to infer intent from fmcs own and different version of the documentary and on-sale_evidence or from the opinion of its expert which the district_court who saw and heard the witnesses was entitled to reject in favor of other evidence
anderson v. city of bessemer_city n.c. 470_u.s._564 574-75 105_s.ct._1504 1512-13 84_l.ed.2d_518_(1985)

fmcs effort to sidestep rule 52 a on the intent_issue assumes there were no findings thereon subject to the rule and confuses two quite different things 1 impermissibly using an inference to establish a fact ; and 2 permissibly drawing an inference from an already established fact
see 10 j._moore & h. bendix moores federal practice ¡± 301.03 [ 1 ] 2d ed
1987` from proof of a certain fact or facts it may be logical to conclude that another fact does or does not exist
the conclusion is reached by inference which involves only reason and experience`
fmc would for example have the court infer the ultimate fact that randolph intentionally withheld from the pto a printed publication describing the invention
the district_court determined based on all the testimony at trial that randolph did not believe *1417 the document was a printed publication describing the invention
unable or unwilling to attack that determination as clearly erroneous fmc argues in effect that the law required the court to have drawn from a fact the document a first` inference' that it was what fmcs witnesses said it was i.e. a printed publication under ¡± 102 b ; a second` inference' that randolph knew it was such ; and a third` inference' that randolph intentionally or with gross_negligence withheld it from the pto
an inference can and often must be drawn from established facts and direct proof of wrongful intent is not required but drawing an inference on an inference on an inference is not the role of the fact finder.11

on the intent_issue as on others in its brief fmc misperceives the roles of fact and law in the judicial process
that a finding can not stand if reached through improper application of a legal standard governing the fact finding function pullman-standard v. swint 456_u.s._273 287 102_s.ct._1781 1789 72_l.ed.2d_66_(1982) ; panduit corp. v. dennison manufacturing co. 810_f.2d_1561 1567-68 1_uspq2d_1593 1597 fed.cir
) cert
denied 481_u.s._1052 107_s.ct._2187 95_l.ed.2d_843_(1987) does not mean that a legal_conclusion can exist in a vacuum
established facts undisputed or correctly found lead to legal_conclusions not the other way round.12 moreover findings must be viewed in their entireties
fmcs argument that legal_error occurred in determining that certain_documents were not material prior_art for example is simply irrelevant to the challenge of the above-quoted finding of no intent to deceive which finding was expressly premised on an assumption that the documents were` pertinent_prior_art
`` 13

the district_court committed no error of either fact or law in concluding fmc has failed to demonstrate by clear and convincing_evidence that manitowoc engaged in` inequitable_conduct' in the prosecution of the application for the beduhn383_patent14

654 f.supp.at 935 2 uspq2d at 1983

( 2 antitrust
judge_hart fully delineated his conclusions in respect of fmcs antitrust_claims in segments devoted to 1 section 1 of the sherman act 15 u.s.c.¡±¡± 1-7 act ; 2 walker_process ; and 3 section 2 of the act
fmc abandoned on appeal its ¡± 1 claim
fmcs failure to establish inequitable_conduct precludes a determination that it had borne its greater burden of establishing the fraud required to support its walker_process claim
because the patent was not fraudulently procured fmcs extended attack on judge_harts findings and conclusions on the relevant_market and monopoly_power_elements of a ¡± 2 violation and manitowocs correspondingly extended defense thereof are irrelevant

( a` walker_process' in korody-colyer_corp. v. general_motors_corp. 828_f.2d_1572 1578 4_uspq2d_1203 1207 fed.cir.1987 ; argus_chemical *1418 corp. v. fibre_glass-evercoat_co. 812_f.2d_1381 1384-85 1_uspq2d_1971 1973-74 fed.cir.1987 ; and american_hoist 725 f.2d at 1368 220 uspq at 777 this court noted the distinction between inequitable_conduct that can lead to a declaration of patent_unenforceability and fraud that can lead to antitrust_damages under the walker_process rationale
in korody-colyer 828 f.2d at 1578 4 uspq2d at 1207 those seeking unenforceability were seen as raising a shield and those seeking antitrust_damages as unsheathing a sword
fmc broke its walker_process sword when it failed to establish inequitable_conduct

( b section 2
the parties appear from the briefs to have recognized that the relevant_market and monopoly_power_elements of a ¡± 2 violation would come into play only after it has been determined that manitowoc has knowingly attempted to enforce a fraudulently obtained patent
there is no relationship between the antitrust_laws and manitowocs patent if the patent were valid properly procured and enforced
the parties on appeal devote major segments of their briefs to the ¡± 2 relevant_market and monopoly_power_elements but say nothing of any nonpatent charge of improper nefarious or illegal monopoly-seeking conduct of manitowoc.15 similarly there is no indication in the briefs or the record that the interest sought to be protected by the antitrust_laws i.e. the welfare of the consumer was adversely affected by anything manitowoc did.16 because fmc failed to establish the fraud required by walker_process there is no need to discuss either judge_harts findings and conclusions on the relevant_market and monopoly_power_elements of a ¡± 2 violation or fmcs legal_error assertions and manitowocs refutation of those assertions.17

( 3 unfair competition
having found and concluded that fmc had not prevailed on any theory of federal law judge_hart correctly deemed it unnecessary to discuss fmcs state law claim of unfair_competition
fmc based that claim on patent_invalidity and inequitable_conduct and carried its burden on neither
fmc nonetheless asks this court even if we agree with the district_court on those issues to order a new_trial to determine whether manitowoc unfairly competed` by pursuing its frivolous infringement_charge'
as above indicated the infringement_charge was not frivolous
fmc says remand for new_trial is required because judge_hart never decided whether the infringement_charge was frivolous
the argument fails because judge_hart necessarily made that decision when he denied fmcs request for attorney_fees a request based on the assertion that the infringement_charge was frivolous.18

conclusion
fmc having failed to show error justifying or mandating a new_trial the judgment parts appealed from must be affirmed

affirmed

fmc complains that some findings and conclusions were very like those proposed by manitowoc

fmc does not attribute the same shortcomings to the district_courts understanding in respect of the infringement issue on which fmc prevailed and in relation to which the court applied a claim_interpretation fmc here labels legal_error
5
fmc also asserts and manitowoc disputes that judge_hart erred in not adopting what fmc says was the courts claim_interpretation in american_hoist & derrick_co. v. manitowoc_co. 448_f.supp._1372 197_uspq_677_(e.d.wisc.1978) affd 603_f.2d_629 202_uspq_705_(7th_cir.1979)
the dispute relates to issues now moot and need not be discussed in this opinion

fmc quotes its witness testimony on the q-1064_proposal but ignores that part of the testimony of manitowocs expert shapiro in which he said the device shown therein` would not work'
7
that we deem unnecessary a detailed discussion of the district_courts evaluation of the q-1064_proposal the beduhn_speech and the on-sale_evidence as nonmaterial does not in any sense suggest either the presence or absence of error of either fact or law in that evaluation
though inequitable_conduct involves a balancing of materiality and intent j.p._stevens 747 f.2d at 1560 223 uspq at 1092 and an overwhelming showing of materiality plus applicants knowledge of that materiality may raise an inference of intent so strong as to require a convincing showing of subjective_good_faith to offset it no such overwhelming showing of materiality and knowledge of materiality was made here by fmc
indeed the district_court refused to find either materiality or knowledge of materiality

in j.p._stevens 747 f.2d at 1560 223 uspq at 1092` gross_negligence' was seen as occurring when a reasonable person` should have known of the materiality of a withheld reference'
inequitable_conduct was found but` gross_negligence' alone was not described as mandating a finding of intent to mislead
on the contrary the court was careful to point out that no evidence of subjective_good_faith was adduced to offset gross_negligence
10
in j.p._stevens and in driscoll v. cebalo 731_f.2d_878 221_uspq_745_(fed.cir.1984) applicants unsuccessfully asserted that their failure to disclose was acceptable because it was based on their own particular claim_interpretations which in turn rendered the withheld references nonmaterial
11
fmc says legal_error is evidenced by judge_harts statement that` a determination ofinequitable_conduct may not be based on inferences' 654 f.supp.at 934 2 uspq2d at 1983 yet the statement is absolutely accurate
this court has held that one attempting to establish` inequitable_conduct' must meet a` clear and convincing' standard
j.p._stevens 747 f.2d at 1559 223 uspq at 1092
12
as judge rich said in in re ruscetta 255_f.2d_687 689 118_uspq_101 103 ccpa 1958 [ u ] ndue liberties should not be taken with court decisions which should be construed in accordance with the precise issue before the court and.. a fertile source of error in patent law is the misapplication of a sound legal principle established in one case to another case in which the facts are essentially different and the principle has no application whatsoever
13
fmcs argument that judge_hart erred in not applying inequitable_conduct standards to individual claims is rendered superfluous by the finding of no intent even if the documents were pertinent_prior_art
14
judge_hart decided the present case and hemstreet v. burroughs corp. 2_uspq2d_1001_(n.d.ill.1987) [ available on westlaw 1987_wl_6407 ] on the same day
in the latter he granted summary judgment of patent_unenforceability on the ground of inequitable_conduct applying the law to a different factual foundation
15
fmc says without record citation that even if the patent were not procured by fraud manitowoc asserted it in bad faith after learning that it was invalid
in view of its holding of validity and absence of inequitable_conduct the district_court properly ignored the assertion
16
mere procurement of a patent whatever the conduct of the applicant in the procurement can not without more affect the welfare of the consumer and can not in itself violate the antitrust_laws
see generally r. bork the antitrust paradox 50-51 1978 ; w. bowman patent and antitrust law 1 2-3 14 1973
17
as with other issues not requiring discussion see supra note 7 the absence of discussion suggests neither the presence nor absence of error of either fact or law in the district_courts findings and conclusions on relevant_market and monopoly power
