opinion
newman circuit_judge
this patent_infringement_suit concerns the antihypertension drug having the brand name tarkathe_r
tarkathe_r is a combination of two active ingredients into a single dosage product the angiotensin converting enzyme ace inhibitor trandolapril and the calcium_channel_blocker also called` calcium_antagonist' verapamil_hydrochloride
the combination drug is covered by united_states patent no._5721,244 the ¡¬244_patent and is owned by or exclusively licensed to sanofi-aventis_deutschland_gmbh a company of germany aventis_pharma_s.a. a company of france ; abbott_gmbh a company of germany and abbott_laboratories and abbott_laboratories inc. united_states_companies collectively` plaintiffs'

the new drug application nda for the tarkathe_r_product was approved by the food and drug administration in 1996 and acquired by abbott_laboratories in 2001
in 2007 the defendants glenmark pharmaceuticals inc. and glenmark_pharmaceuticals_ltd. collectively` glenmark' filed an abbreviated new_drug_application anda for the generic counterpart of this product
since the ¡¬ 244 patent had not expired glenmark filed a hatch-waxman` paragraph_iv_certification' leading to the filing by plaintiffs of this infringement suit

launch of glenmarks generic_product was stayed for 30 months as the statute *big_token__1357_provides._21__big_token u.s.c.¡± 355 j 5 b iii
after the stay expired in 2010 plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction which the district_court denied
in june 2010 glenmark launched its generic_product` at-risk' while this litigation proceeded in the district_court

trial was to a jury
glenmark admitted infringement and the jury held that the ¡¬244_patent had not been proved invalid
the jury awarded $ 15,200,000 in lost profits and $ 803,514 in price erosion damages
post-trial motions were denied and judgment was entered on the verdict
the district_court retained authority to assess post-verdict damages if this court sustained the judgment on appeal

glenmark does not appeal the quantum of damages but argues 1 that the ¡¬ 244 patent is invalid 2 that glenmark is entitled to a new_trial based on a prejudicial jury instruction on evidence spoliation and 3 that no damages should be awarded due to lack of standing of the abbott_united_states_companies
plaintiffs defend the judgment and also state that this court lacks jurisdiction to entertain this appeal because the district_courts judgment was not final

we conclude that jurisdiction is proper and affirm the district_courts judgment and related rulings.1

i
jurisdiction
within 30 days after the district_court denied glenmarks post-verdict motions glenmark filed a notice of appeal
plaintiffs state that this appeal is premature because the district_court did not issue a document entitled` final_judgment' and retained authority to award post-judgment damages ; thus plaintiffs argue that there is no appellate jurisdiction

glenmark responds that on september 30 2011 the district_court entered an order that disposed of every pending claim and defense except the final calculation of damages
the order 1 denied glenmarks pre-verdict rule 50 a motion 2 denied glenmarks motions for post-verdict judgment as a matter of law on the issues of standing and double patenting and 3 granted plaintiffs request for an injunction
ecf no._379
glenmark timely filed a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law under rule 50 b which the district_court denied
ecf no._410
glenmark appealed within 30 days of that denial

glenmark points out that 28 u.s.c.¡± 1292 c 2 recognizes finality for purposes of appeal although the accounting of damages may not be complete
the statute assigns the federal_circuit jurisdiction of ¡± 1292 c 2 -an appeal from a judgment in a civil action for patent_infringement which would otherwise be appealable to the united_states_court of appeals for the federal_circuit and is final except for an accounting
in robert bosch llc v. pylon mfg corp. 719_f.3d_1305 1317 fed.cir.2013 en banc this court reiterated that` an accounting' includes the determination of damages

the jury found the damages for the period covered by the evidence at trial
the district_courts issuance of an order closing the case with provision for an accounting of any additional damages that *1358 may accrue if the decision is affirmed on appeal does not negate finality of a judgment that meets the terms of ¡± 1292 c 2
no` magic words' are needed to confer final_judgment
see local union no._1992 of int l bhd
of elec
workers v. okonite co. 358_f.3d_278 285 3d cir.2004` the orders denomination as anorder rather than ajudgment does not mean that it fails to satisfy the separate document requirement' of the final_judgment rule
) ; hill v. potter 352_f.3d_1142 1144 7th cir.2003` the test for finality is.. whether the district_court has finished with the case`
glenmark is correct that the judgment was final and ripe for appeal and that this court is properly exercising jurisdiction

ii
patent validity
glenmarks principal challenge to validity is on the ground of obviousness

the tarkathe_r_product is a combination of two hypertension medications trandolapril and verapamil_hydrochloride
the combination is stated to provide longer-lasting control than previously known treatments
the product is stated to have significant advantages including improved kidney function and improved blood vessel structure without the need for multiple daily doses
there was evidence that these benefits were not known for prior_art hypertension treatments

patent validity on the ground of obviousness is a question of law based on underlying facts
graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 17-18 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966)
the factual components include the scope and content of the prior_art the differences between the prior_art and the claimed invention the level of skill in the art and any objective evidence of nonobviousness
id.at 17 86_s.ct._684
when the question of obviousness is tried to a jury on appeal we ascertain whether the jury was correctly instructed on the law whether there was substantial_evidence in support of factual_findings necessary to the verdict and whether the verdict was correct on the supported facts
the court must` accept implicit factual_findings upon which the legal conclusion is based when they are supported by substantial_evidence'
kinetic concepts inc. v. smith & nephew inc. 688_f.3d_1342 1359 fed.cir.2012

in suit is claim 3 of the ¡¬244_patent shown with claim 1 from which it depends 1
a pharmaceutical composition comprising a an angiotensin-converting enzyme_inhibitor ace_inhibitor.. and b a calcium_antagonist or a physiologically acceptable_salt thereof ; wherein said ace_inhibitor and said calcium_antagonist are present in said composition in amounts effective for treating hypertension ;.. 3
a composition according to claim 1 wherein said ace_inhibitor is trandolapril [ formula omitted ] or a physiologically acceptable_salt thereof or quinapril [ formula omitted ] or a physiologically acceptable_salt thereof
the jury was instructed on the presumption of validity and that invalidity must be proved by clear and convincing_evidence
the jury found that claim 3 had not been proved invalid on the ground of obviousness
glenmark argues that the verdict can not stand as a matter of law on the premise that if a combination of classes of components is already known all selections within such classes are obvious to try as a matter of law
glenmark argues that it is irrelevant that the combination is ultimately found to have unpredicted or superior properties if those properties though unknown in the prior_art could be *1359 attributed to one of the prior_art components of the combination

a
the trandolapril ace_inhibitor in the tarkathe_r_product is distinguished from the class of previously known ace_inhibitors in that trandolapril is a` double-ring' compound whereas the prior_art had studied primarily` single-ring' compounds
at the time the ¡¬244_patent_application was filed in 1986 the single-ring_ace_inhibitors enalapril and captopril were the only ace_inhibitors approved by the fda and both of these drugs had a short duration of action
captopril was typically dosed three or more times per day and enalapril was dosed twice per day
the dosage requirements of these drugs were unchanged in prior_art studies involving combinations with calcium_channel_blockers

glenmark argued at trial and repeats on this appeal that the tarkathe_r_product simply substituted one known ace_inhibitor for another
the plaintiffs responded that there were hundreds if not thousands of potential combinations of ace_inhibitors and calcium_antagonists in 1986 and that none of the available information pointed directly at the combinations claimed
the plaintiffs pointed out that nothing in the art suggested the combination of the double-ring trandolapril with verapamil_hydrochloride or suggested that this combination would provide the previously unavailable extended and improved efficacy

at trial glenmarks expert agreed that quinapril and trandolapril are of the class of double-ring_ace_inhibitors and that neither of these double-ring compounds was suggested for use in combination with a calcium_channel_blocker in any prior_art reference
he opined that the number of rings on the ace_inhibitor was not an important consideration for his analysis
this view was challenged by the testimony of plaintiffs expert who testified that persons skilled in this field at the time of the patent generally believed that double-ring_ace_inhibitors were not more effective than single-ring_inhibitors to control hypertension because single-ring_structures were believed to fill the` pocket' of the ace enzyme to inhibit the enzymes activity and that the double-ring_inhibitors would not fit in the pocket as effectively
plaintiffs expert also explained that as a mode of treatment combination therapy was not favored in 1986 as compared to` stepped care' in which physicians were instructed to use one drug at a time

glenmarks expert disagreed as to whether persons of ordinary_skill in 1986 would have had different perceptions of the single-ring and double-ring_ace_inhibitors and different expectations as to combination products
however there was not disagreement that the previously tested combinations of ace_inhibitors and calcium_channel_blockers required more than once daily dosing and that the longer-lasting effectiveness of the tarkathe_r combination along with its improved kidney and blood_vessel_function were not provided by or predicted or suggested by the prior_art

glenmark argues that claim 3 is nonetheless invalid as a matter of law
glenmark argues that it is not controlling whether any double-ring product had previously been evaluated or suggested for combination with calcium_antagonists for all combinations were obvious as a matter of law
glenmark argues that because the single-ring_inhibitors had been tested in combination with calcium_antagonists it was` obvious to try' every combination of effective ace_inhibitor and calcium_channel_blocker
glenmark_br.at 35` it is not invention merely to select something from a list of items in the prior_art
``

*1360 glenmark argues that since it was` obvious to try' the double-ring_inhibitors in combination with calcium_channel_blockers as a matter of law patentability is not available even if the combination is later found to possess unexpected or advantageous properties
glenmark states that the jury_verdict was based on incorrect law and that the ¡¬244_patent is invalid

in ksr international co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 421 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007) the court explained that` obvious to try' may apply when` there are a finite number of identified predictable solutions' to a known problem
the court explained that when the path has been identified and` leads to the anticipated success it is likely the product not of innovation but of ordinary_skill and common sense'
id
this court has elaborated that the identified path must` present a finite and small in the context of the art number of options easily traversed to show obviousness'
ortho-mcneil pharm. inc. v. mylan labs. inc. 520_f.3d_1358 1364 fed.cir.2008
as illustrated in in re o'farrell 853_f.2d_894 903 fed.cir.1988 it would not be` obvious to try' when` the prior_art gave either no indication of which parameters were critical or no direction as to which of many possible choices is likely to be successful'

glenmark argues that the inventors selection of the double-ring_ace_inhibitors for testing in combination with calcium_antagonists is of itself evidence that it was obvious to try this combination
patentable invention does not require that inventors work from ignorance
technologic advance flows from knowledge experience insight-perhaps hunch or curiosity
patentability does not turn on how the invention was made but on whether it would have been obvious to a person of ordinary_skill in the field
in eisai co. v. dr. reddys laboratories ltd. 533_f.3d_1353_(fed.cir.2008) the court observed that in the medical arts` potential solutions are less likely to be genuinely predictable' id.at 1359 as compared with other arts such as the mechanical devices in ksr

glenmark also argues that later-discovered benefits can not be considered in an obviousness analysis here referring to the improved kidney and blood_vessel_function that were observed after the patent_application was filed
that is incorrect ; patentability may consider all of the characteristics possessed by the claimed invention whenever those characteristics become manifest
see e.g. knoll pharm co. v. teva pharm
usa inc. 367_f.3d_1381 1385 fed.cir.2004 holding that` [ t ] here is no requirement that an inventions properties and advantages were fully known before the patent_application was filed or that the patent_application contains all of the work done in studying the invention in order for that work to be introduced into evidence in response to litigation attack
`` ; genetics inst. llc v. novartis vaccines & diagnostics inc. 655_f.3d_1291 1307 fed.cir.2011 holding that inventors may rely on advantages appearing after the patent_application was filed
see also in re khelghatian 53_ccpa_1441 364_f.2d_870 876 1966 reliance on an unexpected property not disclosed in the application may be entitled to weight if` directed to that which would inherently flow from what was originally disclosed'

glenmark states that its position that this combination was obvious to try is supported by this courts rulings in merck & co. v. biocraft laboratories inc. 874_f.2d_804_(fed.cir.1989) and richardson-vicks inc. v. upjohn co. 122_f.3d_1476_(fed.cir.1997)
the plaintiffs respond that those cases conform to the criteria in ksr 550 u.s. at 417 127_s.ct._1727 that when the components provide only their known *1361 properties to produce results shown or predicted in the prior_art the combination may be obvious to try

in merck v. biocraft the claimed combination of amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide was specifically named in the prior_art and had no` unexpectedly good' properties compared with the separate components 874 f.2d at 808-09 ; thus the court held that it was obvious to try this combination
in richardson-vicks the patent claimed the combination of pseudoephedrine and ibuprofen in a single pill ; no unexpected properties were asserted for this combination of known products and the court held that the combination was` clearly suggested by the prior_art'
122 f.3d at 1477 1484
in both of these cases the drug combinations were deemed obvious to try for reasons in conformity with the courts explication in ksr

the plaintiffs contrast those cases with the courts ruling in pozen inc. v. par pharmaceutical inc. 696_f.3d_1151 1165 fed.cir.2012 where on facts analogous to the case at bar the court sustained a patent on a combination of the known compounds naproxen and sumatriptan for treatment of migraine headaches for this combination was not previously known or suggested and was found to have longer-lasting efficacy than either component separately
the plaintiffs stress that there was no prior knowledge that the combination of a double-ring ace_inhibitor with calcium_antagonists would be longer lasting than the hypertension treatments at the time

the jury could reasonably have relied on the testimony of the plaintiffs expert that persons skilled in the art in 1986 would not have predicted the longer-lasting hypertension control demonstrated by the double-ring_structures of quinapril and trandolapril in combination with calcium_antagonists because of the widespread belief that double-ring_inhibitors would not fit the pocket structure of the ace
although glenmark disputed every aspect there was substantial_evidence to support findings that in turn support the verdict that obviousness had not been proved by clear and convincing_evidence
the district_courts review of the evidence and confirmation of the jury_verdict manifests no error of law
the judgment that invalidity had not been proved is affirmed

iii
spoliation
the district_court concluded that glenmark had violated its duty to preserve relevant_evidence when litigation is planned or reasonably foreseen
the court denied the plaintiffs motion for default but instructed the jury that it was permitted to draw an adverse_inference that the electronic documents that glenmark deleted in 2005_and_2006 would have been unfavorable

glenmark does not dispute that in 2005_and_2006 it had in place a policy whereby all emails and related electronic documents were retained for only one month and that this policy continued as glenmark was proceeding with production of the generic_product and preparation of the anda in 2006
in response to plaintiffs discovery requests on filing of this hatch-waxman suit glenmark produced three emails from 2005 and twenty-two email chains from 2006 although other evidence such as the work_product log showed activity in preparation for litigation

the district_court applied third circuit law under which spoliation occurs when` the evidence was in the partys control ; the evidence is relevant to the claims or defenses in the case ; there has been actual suppression or withholding of evidence ; and the duty to preserve the evidence was *1362 reasonably foreseeable to the party'
bull v. united parcel serv. inc. 665_f.3d_68 73 3d cir.2012

the district_court found that litigation became` reasonably foreseeable' to glenmark no later than the date asserted for` work_product' in its privilege_log
spoliation op.at 9
the privilege_log contained entries for` work_product' as early as february 2006
the court observed that` [ a ] party claiming work-product immunity bears the burden of showing that the materials in question wereprepared in the course of preparation for possible litigation
`` id
( quoting holmes v. pension plan of bethlehem steel corp. 213_f.3d_124 138 3d cir.2000

the district_court exercised its discretion and gave the jury a permissive instruction as follows you may make an adverse_inference in this case against glenmark
in this case i have determined that glenmark systematically overwrote the emails on its email server between february 23 2006 and mid-2007 and that some of these documents were relevant to the claims in suit
an adverse_inference permits you the jury to infer that the destroyed emails and attached documents might or would have been unfavorable to the position of glenmark
however you are not required to draw such an inference and the weight to be given such an inference is your decision
jury instructions ecf no._366 at 16 ll.1-13

glenmark argues that the district_courts instruction was improper and prejudicial citing hill v. laeisz 435_f.3d_404 420 3d cir.2006 for the statement that prejudice occurs when` there is a reasonable possibility' that the error affected the result
glenmark argues that the plaintiffs did not show that any deleted emails contained relevant_evidence
the plaintiffs respond that the content of the emails is unknown because they were destroyed and point to glenmarks decision to produce and follow the anda procedure for a generic_version of tarkathe_r in 2005 and glenmarks claim of litigation work_product protection starting in february 2006 as indirect evidence of relevance of the destroyed documents
a spoliation sanction` may rely on circumstantial evidence to suggest the contents of destroyed evidence'
beaven v. u.s. dep't of justice 622_f.3d_540 555 6th cir.2010

glenmarks witnesses stated that email was a mode of communication used during the relevant time frame
terrance coughlin glenmarks president and ceo stated that he communicated by email with dr._soni vice president of intellectual property and mr. dutra head of marketing when they were unable to meet in person
dr._soni testified that he communicated with the research and development department in india concerning the decision to develop a generic_version of tarkathe_r and acknowledged that glenmark used email to communicate with the team in india during the development
it was pointed out to the district_court that attorney work_product claims were made relative to this period before glenmarks later institution of a litigation hold
it was reasonable for the district_court to infer that some destroyed emails related to issues for which litigation was expected by glenmark
see gumbs v. int l harvester inc. 718_f.2d_88 96 3d cir.1983` the unexplained failure or refusal of a party to judicial proceedings to produce evidence that would tend to throw light on the issues authorizes under certain circumstances an inference or presumption unfavorable to such party
``

the destroyed records were from the period that was acknowledged to include *1363 discussion of the generic drug marketing in the united_states preparation of the anda and the paragraph_iv_certification challenging the patent
glenmark did not negate the reasonable inference that the destroyed emails related to relevant issues
see brewer v. quaker state oil ref corp. 72_f.3d_326 334 3d cir.1995` when the contents of a document are relevant to an issue in a case the trier of fact generally may receive the fact of the documents nonproduction or destruction as evidence that the party that has prevented production did so out of the well-founded fear that the contents would harm him`
absent any reasonable negation of this inference the district_courts finding that the documents were likely to be relevant was not clearly erroneous and informing the jury of the destruction program was not an abuse of discretion
see fujifilm corp. v. benun 605_f.3d_1366 1370 fed.cir.2010 the district_court abuses its discretion only` if its determinations are based on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence
``

although the district_court declined to impose the sanction of forfeiture as requested by plaintiffs the court was well within its discretion in informing the jury that it may draw an inference that the destroyed documents may have been unfavorable to glenmark
the courts are not required to tolerate acts in derogation of the integrity of judicial_process
chambers v. nasco inc. 501_u.s._32 45 111_s.ct._2123 115_l.ed.2d_27_(1991)` a primary aspect of that discretion is the ability to fashion an appropriate sanction for conduct which abuses the judicial_process`
the destruction of documents in the course of preparation for litigation has no entitlement to judicial protection and need not be concealed from the jury
a new_trial on this ground is not warranted

iv
standing
glenmark challenges the standing of abbott_laboratories and abbott_laboratories inc. ali as co-plaintiffs in the instant suit
glenmark argues that these united_states_companies do not have exclusive_licenses to the ¡¬ 244 patent as glenmark states is required for entitlement to damages for their lost profits and price erosion due to infringement

it is not disputed that sanofi-aventis as the owner by assignment of the ¡¬ 244 patent and aventis_pharma as exclusive_licensee of the ¡¬244_patent have standing in this action
aventis_pharma in turn granted the` irrevocable sole and exclusive_right' to abbott_gmbh to make use and sell the trandolapril-verapamil combination product under the ¡¬244_patent
abbott_laboratories has since 2001 been the owner of the fda-approved nda for this product and ali is the exclusive united_states distributor for abbott_laboratories

the plaintiffs state that abbott_laboratories and ali have exclusive_rights to market this product under the ¡¬244_patent through express and implied licenses
the plaintiffs provided the district_court with evidence of the agreements and understandings related to the exclusive_rights in the united_states
the plaintiffs provided a` confirmatory_agreement' executed in 2010 describing the various transfers of rights

the district_court found that the abbott arrangements constituted express and implied exclusive_rights and licenses to the united_states plaintiffs
the court also found that abbott_laboratories 2001 acquisition of the nda and alis exclusive distributor agreement` indicate intent of the parties to provide abbott_laboratories and ali with an exclusive_license'
*1364 standing op.at 8
as held in kalman v. berlyn corp. 914_f.2d_1473 1481 fed.cir.1990` an exclusive vendor of a product under a patent could be a co-plaintiff in an action for patent_infringement'
see also weinar v. rollform inc. 744_f.2d_797 807 fed.cir.1984 holding that an oral_contract is sufficient to confer co-plaintiff standing when the acts of infringement injured all of the plaintiffs and when` [ m ] ultiple recoveries are neither recoverable nor here involved'

glenmark argues that the district_court erred in relying on abbott_laboratories ownership of the nda since 2001 because abbott_germanys exclusive_license is dated 2004
glenmark states that abbott_laboratories could not make ali the exclusive distributor under a patent in which abbott_laboratories had no rights
glenmark argues that the 2010 confirmatory_agreement could not cure these defects and also is` void for lack of consideration'
glenmark_br.at 55-56

the district_court penetrated these complexities
the courts finding that any necessary licenses existed expressly or impliedly has not been shown to be incorrect in law or clearly erroneous in fact
see atacs corp. v. trans world commc'ns inc. 155_f.3d_659 665 3d cir.1998` this issue of contract formation invokes a mixed standard of appellate review
the district_courts factual_findings especially with respect to the parties intentions will not be reversed unless the record demonstrates that they are clearly erroneous
`` ; aspex eyewear inc. v. miracle optics inc. 434_f.3d_1336 1344 fed.cir.2006` determining whether there was an implied license.. prior to the filing of the complaint may involve a factual determination
``

the district_court found that abbott_laboratories and ali had exclusive_rights to the patented product in the united_states based on abbott_laboratories ownership of the nda and the relationships and agreements among the plaintiffs
glenmark argues that this reasoning is flawed because the agreements and the nda were not consonant in time pointing out that abbott_laboratories owned the nda before abbott_germany obtained the exclusive_rights to the ¡¬244_patent in the united_states
the district_court held that in determining patent and license rights in complex transfers the standard is whether the evidence as a whole convinces the trier of fact of mutual intent to transfer and vest exclusive_rights
see weinar 744 f.2d at 807 oral_contract sufficient to confer co-plaintiff standing when` all of the evidence presented at trial taken together supports the inference of an exclusive_right'
here all entities in the license chain joined in the suit such that there is no danger of multiple suits for infringement
id
(` multiple recoveries are neither recoverable nor here involved
``

glenmark relies on rite-hite which held that nonexclusive independent sales organizations who served as distributers for rite-hite do not have standing as coplaintiffs in a patent suit when they do not have` any right to exclude others under the patent'
rite-hite corp. v. kelley co. 56_f.3d_1538 1553 fed.cir.1995
here abbott_laboratories and ali have fully exclusive_rights in the united_states
although glenmark argues that abbott_laboratories ownership of the nda has no bearing on patent exclusivity the issue before the district_court was whether the plaintiffs intended to grant exclusive_rights to abbotts united_states_companies and did so grant
abbott_laboratories exclusive ownership of the nda conforms to that intent and is reflected in the entirety of the commercial relationships as the district_court recognized

*1365 abbott_laboratories acquisition of the tarkathe_r_nda comports with the license to abbott_germany and the confirmation of the exclusive_license to abbotts united_states_companies for the united_states patent rights applicable to the tarkathe_r_nda
see 21 u.s.c.¡± 355 a` no person shall introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any new drug unless an approval of an application filed pursuant to subsection b or j of this section is effective with respect to such drug`
the district_court did not clearly err in finding that the plaintiffs intended that the abbott_united_states_companies have exclusive_rights in the united_states under the ¡¬244_patent

we affirm that abbott_laboratories and ali have the exclusive_rights to the tarkathe_r_product in the united_states
as established in kalman 914 f.2d at 1481 these united_states entities have standing to participate in this suit and to recover damages for their injury due to glenmarks infringement
glenmark does not appeal the amount of damages

conclusion
the rulings and judgment of the district_court are affirmed
we remand to the district_court for the reserved accounting of any post-verdict damages
