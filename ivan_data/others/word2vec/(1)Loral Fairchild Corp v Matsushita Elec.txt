opinion
michel circuit_judge
this appeal requires our determination of whether the patentee submitted sufficient evidence to preclude summary_judgment of invalidity for obviousness over an article published prior to the filing_date of the patent_application
oral argument was heard on july_12,_2001
because we hold that the patentee raised a genuine_issue as to whether its reduction to practice preceded the publication of the article we reverse the grant of summary_judgment and remand for further_proceedings

background
in 1991 loral sued numerous japanese electronics manufacturers and their u.s. distributors for infringement of claim 1 of its united states patent no._3931,674 the ¡¬674_patent which claims a process for manufacturing a charge-coupled device` ccd'
a ccd is an important component in electronic cameras that produces an electrical signal representing the image that is focused upon it
this signal can then be processed and displayed on a video monitor
in august 1995 the district_court severed and stayed lorals claims against the non-manufacturing_defendants leaving six manufacturing_defendants sony sanyo toshiba hitachi nec and oki
the court ordered separate trials for each

sony was the first and only defendant to go to trial
over the course of five weeks in 1996 loral and sony tried the issues of validity and infringement to a jury
on february 14 1996 the jury returned a verdict finding that sony did not prove invalidity of the asserted claims and that loral had proven infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
sony then moved for judgment as a matter of law` jmol' or alternatively for a new trial

the district_court granted sonys motion for jmol holding that no reasonable_jury could find that sony infringed
see loral_fairchild_corp. v. victor_co. of japan 931_f.supp._1014_(e.d.n.y.1996) loral_ii
one basis for the courts decision was that sonys accused process could not infringe under the doctrine of equivalents because it had been disclosed in a journal article authored by dr. darrel erb` the erb_reference' and published on december 3 1973 prior to the february 8 1974 filing_date of the application that issued as the *1361 ¡¬674_patent
id.at 1030 citing wilson sporting goods co. v. david geoffrey & assoc. 904_f.2d_677 683-85 14_uspq2d_1942 1948-49 fed.cir.1990 patentee may not assert a range of equivalents for infringement purposes that includes the prior_art
although the jury had returned a special verdict form indicating that it found that the erb_reference did not qualify as prior_art against the ¡¬674_patent the district_court concluded that no reasonable_jury could have done so
loral_ii 931 f.supp.at 1031

on appeal we affirmed the grant of jmol but solely on the ground that lorals allegations of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents were barred by prosecution history estoppel ; our decision did not address whether the erb_reference is prior_art with respect to the ¡¬674_patent
loral_fairchild_corp. v. sony corp. 181_f.3d_1313 1316_n._3 50_uspq2d_1865 1876_n._3_(fed.cir.1999) loral_iii
in response loral maintained its actions against only those of the remaining manufacturing_defendants that it believed were literally infringing the ¡¬674_patent -toshiba and nec

on april_10,_2000 toshiba and nec each moved for summary_judgment that claim 1 is invalid as obvious in view of the erb_reference which was asserted to be prior_art under ¡± 102 a
the district_court held a two-day hearing on the motions
the court then issued a final judgment and an unpublished decision granting the motions holding that there was no genuine_issue as to the status of the erb_reference as prior_art and that claim 1 was obvious in light of it
loral_fairchild_corp. v. victor_co. of japan nos._92-0128 & 91-5056 e.d.n.y
june_21,_2000 toshiba i
loral filed a timely notice of appeal and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

discussion
summary judgment is proper only when no` reasonable_jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party'
anderson v. liberty lobby inc. 477_u.s._242 255 106_s.ct._2505 2510 91_l.ed.2d_202_(1986)
in determining whether a genuine_issue of material fact exists the trial_court must assume that the evidence presented by the non-movant is credible and draw all justifiable inferences therefrom in the non-movants favor
id.at 255 106 s.ct.at 2513
because of the statutory presumption of patent validity 35 u.s.c.¡± 282 at trial_toshiba and nec would bear the burden of proving by clear and convincing_evidence that the erb_reference was published prior to lorals reduction to practice
mahurkar v. c.r
bard inc. 79_f.3d_1572 1578 38_uspq2d_1288 1291 fed.cir.1996` bard must persuade the trier of fact by clear and convincing_evidence that the cook_catalog was published prior to dr._mahurkars invention_date`
of course loral would bear a burden of production to present_evidence of its asserted_actual_reduction to practice prior to the filing_date of its patent_application
id.at 1576-77 79_f.3d_1572 38 uspq2d at 1290` had dr._mahurkar not come forward with evidence of an earlier_date of invention the cook_catalog would have been anticipatory prior_art under section 102 a because dr._mahurkars invention_date would have been the filing_date of his patent`
because loral does not argue for conception plus diligence to establish a date of invention prior to the publication_date of the erb_article but only an actual_reduction to practice we address only lorals actual_reduction to practice of the invention

the proceedings in the sony_litigation are relevant to this appeal only because toshiba and nec relied exclusively upon evidence submitted during the sony *1362 trial in support of their motions for summary_judgment
loral however relied upon both evidence submitted during the sony_trial and new_evidence to oppose the motions
critically the district_court applied neither issue preclusion nor collateral estoppel against loral when ruling on the motions by toshiba and nec
rather the district_court permissibly regarded its earlier_findings on the prior_art status of the erb_reference merely as a non-preclusive starting point allowing the parties here both to submit new_evidence and rely upon evidence submitted during the sony_trial
toshiba i slip op.at 9
the trial_courts earlier_findings are not law of the case and we do not understand the court to have so treated them when it ruled upon both the old and the new_evidence

in opposition to toshibas and necs motions for summary_judgment loral argued both that the erb_reference does not render the asserted claim obvious and that it does not constitute prior_art
loral submitted evidence that the inventor named in the ¡¬674_patent dr. gilbert amelio conceived of the invention and actually reduced it to practice prior to the publication of the erb_reference
dr._amelios conception of the invention prior to the publication of the erb_reference is not disputed
thus the critical question in this appeal is whether the evidence submitted by loral was sufficient to raise a genuine_issue as to whether dr._amelios actual_reduction to practice occurred prior to the publication of the erb_reference
if so then the grant of summary_judgment must be reversed

i
the evidence relied upon by loral in opposition to summary judgment
a
the amelio_affidavit
loral referred the district_court to several items of evidence tending to indicate that the invention was actually reduced to practice prior to december 3 1973
the only item not previously considered by the trial_court during the sony_trial was an affidavit executed on april_14,_2000 by dr._amelio` the amelio_affidavit' in which he states that the invention was reduced to practice shortly after september 14 1973 but no later than mid-october 1973-when loral` had initial_production-quality_devices'
because dr._amelio was employed by one of lorals competitors during the sony_litigation he was not available to testify at that time
he subsequently ended that employment and was retained by loral for the purpose of submitting an affidavit in this case

the district_court granted the motions for summary_judgment holding that` claim 1 of the ¡¬674_patent is obvious in light of the erb_reference and therefore invalid'
toshiba i slip op.at 12
in its opinion the district_court concluded that` dr._amelio claims no more than that he wasworking on reducing to practice from june 1973through mid-march 1974'
id.at 11
the amelio_affidavit however undermines that conclusion
in the affidavit dr._amelio asserts a reduction to practice in september 1973 albeit with commercialization efforts continuing through mid-march 1974 stating emphasis added i and those at fairchild under my direction were diligently working on reducing to practice and commercializing the ¡¬674_process throughout the period of time from no later than june 1973 through the introduction of the commercial ccd110 product in mid-march 1974
`` no later than september 14 1973 fairchild produced working devices and established that the ¡¬674_process would work for its intended_purpose'
the underlined sentence was not addressed in the district_courts opinion

once the invention has been shown to work for its intended_purpose reduction *1363 to practice is complete
mahurkar 79 f.3d at 1578 38 uspq2d at 1291
further efforts to commercialize the invention are simply not relevant to determining whether a reference qualifies as prior_art against the patented_invention
the district_court concluded that lorals evidence was insufficient to avoid summary_judgment because the amelio_affidavit contains` no statement asserting that he actually fabricated and demonstrated by testing the device claimed in the ¡¬674_patent before march 1974'
toshiba i slip op.at 11
this conclusion is also not supported by the amelio_affidavit
the ¡¬674_patent claims a process for producing ccds and in his affidavit dr._amelio states that he and others at loral had optimized the claimed process by making iterative changes to its parameters and then evaluating each change by examining the ccds produced
he further states that` by mid-october 1973 we had initial_production-quality_devices' i.e. the claimed process had been demonstrated to work for its intended_purpose
thus in the amelio_affidavit the inventor alleged a reduction to practice prior to publication of the erb_reference
the court may not assess the credibility of testimony when granting summary_judgment ; thus to the extent that the district_court assessed credibility in reaching its conclusions regarding the amelio_affidavit those conclusions were improper
thus because the amelio_affidavit asserts reduction to practice prior to publication of the erb_reference the issue then becomes whether loral submitted independent_evidence sufficient to corroborate this assertion

b. lorals evidence to corroborate the amelio_affidavit
`` in order to establish an actual_reduction to practice an inventors testimony must be corroborated by independent_evidence'
cooper v. goldfarb 154_f.3d_1321 1330 47_uspq2d_1896 1903 fed.cir.1998
the sufficiency of such corroborating evidence is evaluated under a` rule of reason' considering all of the pertinent_evidence
id
(` the rule requires an evaluation of all pertinent_evidence when determining the credibility of an inventors testimony..
in order to corroborate a reduction to practice it is not necessary to produce an actual over-the-shoulder observer
rather sufficient circumstantial evidence of an independent nature can satisfy the corroboration_requirement
``

to corroborate the amelio_affidavit loral relied inter alia upon evidence that had been presented during the sony_trial including the trial testimony of one of dr._amelios co-workers at loral dr. david wen
dr._wen had testified that loral received custom-fabricated lithographic masks necessary for practicing the invention on or about september 14 1973 the date stamped on the masks
dr._wen further testified that` as soon as we receive the masks which are the stencils we would actually start manufacturing the device'
loral also submitted copies of the actual masks which had been submitted into evidence during the sony_trial

other than that of dr._wen loral offered no testimony to corroborate dr._amelios alleged_reduction to practice
loral did however refer the court to other evidence that had been submitted during the sony_trial
in november 1973 loral submitted to the united states air force a responsive proposal to provide ccds produced using the claimed process
in the proposal loral stated that the claimed process` is already showing reliable performance and high yield'
in his declaration amelio stated that he` was ultimately responsible for preparation of the proposal and personally participated in its preparation'
to bolster the credibility of the statement however loral points *1364 out that the air_force_proposal was prepared under a general statutory obligation of truthfulness
see 18 u.s.c.¡± 1001

in loral_ii the district_court afforded the lithographic masks little relevance` at best as recognized by [ lorals ] dr._wen the mask overlay set demonstrates [ loral ] researchers had performed some design work
the overlays do not show that dr._amelio had run the process claimed in the ¡¬ 674 patent and knew it would work for its intended_purpose'
loral_ii 931 f.supp.at 1028
while we agree that by themselves the masks do not prove when the reduction to practice occurred they were necessary for a reduction to practice and dr._wen testified that loral possessed the masks beginning on or about september 14 1973
further dr._wen testified that the masks support that loral employees` had completed the design of the device and were about to begin manufacturing'
this is entirely consistent with and corroborates the timing of the events constituting the reduction to practice alleged in the amelio_affidavit
it also gives rise to a reasonable inference which must be made in favor of non-movant loral that on or about september 14 1973 loral began production_efforts using the claimed process with subsequent_reduction to practice once process_performance had been demonstrated
the air_force_proposal indicates that process_performance was established by november 1973 prior to publication of the erb_reference in december

in cooper 154 f.3d at 1330 47 uspq2d at 1903 we held that reduction to practice had been proven by the inventors testimony corroborated by testimony of his co-workers that he had told them of his reduction to practice and that they had seen him obtain materials of the type necessary to practice the invention
we so held even though` no direct evidence supported goldfarbs testimony that he measured fibril length and observed tissue ingrowth'
id
(` we agree with the board that circumstantial evidence provided sufficient corroboration
`` ; see also lacotte v. thomas 758_f.2d_611 613 225_uspq_633 634 fed.cir.1985 affirming finding of reduction to practice stating` [ t ] he testimony of thomas the inventor and the written evidence of his reduction to practice in his notebook are corroborated by independent circumstantial evidence of his withdrawal of supplies to practice the invention as well as independent corroborating testimony of his associate lee
``

here dr._amelios alleged_reduction to practice to be sure is not corroborated by documentary_evidence of test_results confirming process_performance
it is however corroborated by the testimony of dr._wen the delivery date of the masks necessary to practice the invention and the air_force_proposal
as in both cooper and lacotte loral has presented corroborating testimony by a co-worker of the inventor and has demonstrated that material necessary to practice the invention was obtained prior to the alleged_reduction to practice
and more the district_courts insistence upon` documentary_evidence' to corroborate test_results of dr._amelios claimed reduction to practice was erroneous as a matter of law
toshiba i slip op.at 10` [ t ] o meet the corroboration_requirement loral at a minimum would need to produce documentary_evidence such as signed laboratory notebooks or test_results or activities to show priority'
( emphasis added
under the` rule of reason' the inventors testimony must be sufficiently corroborated by independent_evidence but not necessarily documentary_evidence
rather` [ t ] he rule requires an evaluation of all pertinent_evidence when determining the credibility of an inventors testimony'
*1365 cooper 154 f.3d at 1330 47 uspq2d at 1903 emphasis added
furthermore it is not surprising that loral has been unable to submit documents showing production test_results considering that the events at issue occurred almost 30 years ago

to avoid summary_judgment loral needed only to show that dr._amelio asserted reduction to practice prior to the publication of the erb_article and to provide the corroborating evidence required under this courts precedent.1 it did so

conclusion
in view of the evidence submitted by loral the grant of summary_judgment was improper because that evidence raised a genuine_issue as to whether those at loral reduced the claimed invention to practice prior to the publication of the erb_article
given that we have no occasion to consider lorals other arguments on appeal including the correctness of the district_courts conclusion that the claimed invention is obvious in view of the erb_reference
we therefore reverse the grant of summary_judgment and remand for further_proceedings

reversed and remanded

pauline newman circuit_judge concurring in the judgment
i agree that it is appropriate to reverse the grant of summary_judgment
i write separately lest the majoritys opinion be taken as new law with respect to the requirements for antedating a publication that would otherwise be a reference under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102

antedating a reference
the courts opinion states that a reference can be antedated only by prior reduction to practice stating` of course loral would bear the burden of production to present_evidence of its asserted_actual_reduction to practice prior to the filing_date of its patent_application'
the opinion also states that` at trial_toshiba and nec would bear the burden of proving by clear and convincing_evidence that the erb_reference was published prior to lorals reduction to practice'
however the opinion correctly quotes precedent that the inventor` had tocome forward with evidence of an earlier_date of invention
`` the date of invention is the date of conception not the date of reduction to practice
pfaff v. wells electronics inc. 525_u.s._55 60 119_s.ct._304 142_l.ed.2d_261 48_uspq2d_1641 1644 1998` the primary meaning of the wordinvention in the patent act unquestionably refers to the inventors conception rather than to a physical embodiment of that idea
`` ; id. at 66 119_s.ct._304 142_l.ed.2d_261 48 uspq2d at 1646` petitioners argument *1366.. does not persuade us that it is necessary to engraft a reduction to practice element into the meaning of the terminvention as used in ¡± 102 b' ; burroughs wellcome co. v. barr laboratories inc. 40_f.3d_1223 1227-28 32_uspq2d_1915 1919 fed.cir.1994` conception is the touchstone of inventorship the completion of the mental part of invention'

loral had to show that before the publication_date of the erb_article the inventor dr._amelio had either a reduction to practice or conception of the invention plus diligence to actual or constructive reduction to practice
this is well-established law in the patent office as in the courts 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.131 b the showing of facts shall be such in character and weight as to establish reduction to practice prior to the effective_date of the reference or conception of the invention prior to the effective_date of the reference coupled with due diligence from prior to said date to a subsequent_reduction to practice or to the filing of the application..
the defendants readily concede that dr._amelio had conceived the patented_invention before the publication_date of the reference
also the evidence of activity constituting reduction to practice was not disputed by the defendants ; their arguments were directed solely to the issues of corroboration and the position that the erb date to be overcome was not the date of the articles publication but the date when the underlying work was conceived and done
the interest of clarity of precedent and efficiency on remand require a more positive statement than has been made by my colleagues on this panel
further with the correction of the ruling that the work underlying the erb_article sets the date that must be antedated by lorals reduction to practice there is no longer a disputed issue of fact that requires resolution on remand

corroboration
the court sets requirements of corroboration of the inventors testimony based on the law governing patent office interference practice citing cooper v. goldfarb 154_f.3d_1321 47_uspq2d_1896 fed.cir.1998 and lacotte v. thomas 758_f.2d_611 225_uspq_633 fed.cir.1985 both pto interferences whose detailed and highly formalistic corroboration of the inventors work is traditionally required in order to establish priority between competing inventors
that is not at issue here
here the issue is solely a matter of antedating a publication where the probative value of the inventors testimony is as for any factual question the weight and value of the evidence is determined with due consideration to the issue to be decided as well as any contrary evidence and the burden of proof
the evidentiary standard for antedating a reference is not the same as the pto requirement for establishing priority in an interference contest
inventors affidavits have always been admissible to antedate a reference
the regulations are explicit that evidence to antedate a reference may be provided by the inventor 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.131 a 1 when any claim of an application or a patent under reexamination is rejected [ on reference to ] a printed publication the inventor of the subject matter of the rejected claim.. may submit an appropriate oath or declaration to overcome the patent or publication
the oath or declaration must include facts showing a completion of the invention in this country.. before the date of the printed publication
antedating a reference is a common occurrence governed by a stable and non-controversial jurisprudence
let us not add uncertainties to this law

*big_token__1367_the_102__big_token g issue
the district_court had required that loral show an actual_reduction to practice before the date of the underlying work of the erb_article invoking ¡± 102 g
see loral_fairchild_corp. v. victor_co. of japan no._92-0128 e.d.n.y. june_21,_2000 slip op.at 8` this court comparing the erb_work with the invention of the ¡¬674_patent previously determined that the erb_work was prior_art to the ¡¬674_patent
`` ; id
(` beyond its finding of a lack of diligence however this court also determined that messrs. erb and su conceived the invention before dr._amelio the inventor of the ¡¬674_patent
thus the erb/su conception date predated publication of their article by more than a year
`` ; id.at 10` loral has not proffered any new_evidence to overcome this courts finding based on earlier reduction to practice that the erb_work was prior_art under 35 u.s.c.¡±¡± 102 a and 102 g'
see also loral_fairchild_corp. v. victor_co. of japan 931_f.supp._1014 1032 e.d.n.y.1996` [ t ] he record shows that drs
erb and su actually reduced their process to practice at the end of september 1973.. because dr._amelio can not show reasonable diligence from before this date to his filing_date the erb/su work stands as prior_art
``

the record reflects a kind of inter partes interference proceeding with the authors of the erb paper who testified as to their work and when it was done
there is a specific statutory authorization for conducting an interference in the district_court but this does not apply when there is not an adverse claimant to a patent
reliance on either the date of the erb_publication or the date of the work underlying the publication is mentioned in an ambiguous footnote 1 in this courts opinion which flags the issue but does not lay it to rest
much mischief can flow if we open this door whereby a publication is effective as a reference as of the date the authors did the underlying work
it is our obligation as the reviewing court to act to assure clarity in the law

while loral also argues that the research activities of dr._erb which culminated in the erb_reference do not qualify as prior_art under ¡± 102 g it is not necessary for us to address this issue because the district_court held only that the asserted claim was` obvious in light of the erb_reference'
toshiba i slip op.at 12
throughout the trial_courts jmol decision in the sony case the phrase` the erb_reference' is used to refer exclusively to the erb_publication not the underlying_research_activities
see loral_ii 931 f.supp.at 1027-31
in that same opinion the phrase` the erb_work' is used to refer exclusively to the underlying_research_activities and not the published article
id.at 1031-34
in the decision on review in the instant appeal the district_court stated that` [ t ] his court previously found that the erb_reference and the work underlying that article antedates the ¡¬674_patent'
toshiba i slip op.at 6 emphasis added
thus it seems clear that the court held claim 1 invalid solely on the basis of the erb_article applying it as prior_art under ¡± 102 a
further the issue of validity in view of the underlying research efforts by dr._erb which might qualify as prior_art under ¡± 102 g is nowhere addressed in the motions for or opposition to summary_judgment submitted by the parties to the district_court
