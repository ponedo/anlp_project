opinion
rader circuit_judge
at the close of evidence the united_states_district_court for the northern_district of ohio granted judgment as a matter of law jmol that acromed corporations acromeds u.s._patent_no._4696,290290_patent is not invalid for improper_inventorship
the jurys verdict found that sofamor_danek_group inc. and danek_medical inc. collectively danek literally infringed the claims of the ¡¬290_patent and acromeds u.s._patent_no._4854,311311_patent
the jury further found the claims of the ¡¬311_patent not invalid
because the district_court correctly found insufficient_evidence to invalidate the ¡¬290_patent and correctly upheld the jury_verdict that the claims of the ¡¬311_patent were infringed and not invalid this court affirms

i. acromed is assignee of the ¡¬290_patent which names dr. arthur d. steffee as its sole inventor
the ¡¬290_patent discloses a plate for surgical implantation onto a patients spinal column
the spine_plate straightens a spine misshapen by disc degeneration or fracture
this invention can thus alleviate pain and restore a patients mobility

in his first spine straightening operations dr._steffee hooked and wired rods to patients spines
this early method straightened spines somewhat but the rods would later slip thereby undercutting the effectiveness of the operation
to prevent slippage dr._steffee began to use a plate-and-screw_system similar to that described in the ¡¬290_patent

dr._steffees first plate-and-screw_system used a long plate with fixed location_screw_holes
dr._steffee implanted this type of plate-and-screw_system by drilling or tapping holes into a patients vertebrae aligning the vertebral holes with holes in the plate and then attaching the plate with bone_screws
dr._steffee typically installed two such plates one on each side of the spine
these systems fixed the vertebrae more rigidly than wire and rod systems
the plates with holes in fixed locations however were difficult to install and adapt *1375 to different patients because the holes were rarely spaced identically to pedicle distances between a patients vertebrae

dr._steffee thus improved his plate-and-screw_system in 1982 while working at a hospital in cleveland
he conceived of headless screws that would permit him to first optimally locate such screws in each vertebral pedicle and then attach the spine_plate to the installed screws
dr._steffee took his regular_bone_screws to the cleveland research institute cri hospital machine shop and asked frank janson a machinist to cut the heads off of the screws
without screw heads dr._steffee needed to find another means to attach the plate to the screws in the spine
he conceived of using a tapered conical_nut from a hagie pin a pin commonly used by orthopedists to fix broken hips in children

next dr._steffee recognized that he would need to modify the fixed location_screw_holes in the plate to facilitate attachment at different pedical distances between vertebrae
dr._steffee looked to another well-known device-a small slotted eggers plate which orthopedic surgeons use to fix long bone fractures
dr._steffee asked mr._janson to make a bigger eggers plate to accommodate a spine

dr._steffees final problem was that the slots in the plate could slide along the screws and defeat proper fixation of the plate to the spine
to solve this problem dr._steffee told mr._janson that he needed a plate designed so that the hagie pin nut` sinks in and stays right there'
mr._janson responded to this instruction by putting nests in the slots
the ¡¬290_patent claims the resulting combination

?
the disclosed spine_plate 30 has a series of elongated_slots 52 configured with a series of nests or arcuate_recesses 116
claim 1 of the ¡¬290_patent recites an apparatus for use with fasteners for maintaining vertebrae in a desired relationship said apparatus comprising an elongated_plate for connecting at least two vertebrae.. *1376 said elongated_plate also having at least one elongated_slot extending there through.. said slot being capable of receiving a fastener therein.. and
said slot being defined by opposed_slot_surfaces extending longitudinally of said elongated_plate and arcuate_recesses in said opposed_slot_surfaces and spaced there along the recesses in one of said opposed_slot_surfaces being aligned with the recesses in the other of said opposed_slot_surfaces to define said plurality of locations said recesses comprising means for blocking sliding movement of [ s ] aid elongated_plate relative to the fastener and of said elongated_plate relative to the vertebrae when the fastener is located in a pair of aligned recesses
( emphasis added

dr._steffee also improved the headless bone_screw
the ¡¬311_patent discloses a bone_screw with an elongated shank to e.g. fasten the plate of the ¡¬290_patent to a spine connect broken bones or connect prostheses to bones in any part of the body
the ¡¬311_patent describes the bone_screw as having three identifiable segments 1 a first externally threaded portion 142 for receiving a connecting member such as a nut ; 2 a cylindrical_body_portion for projecting into and engaging the bone_opening surface 182 ; and 3 a second threaded portion for attaching the screw to the bone 144

bones have a hard outer shell called cortical_bone and a spongy center called cancellous bone
cancellous bone contains blood vessels
thus once a hole is drilled or

?
tapped into a bone effluence blood and other bodily fluids may leak into the hole
this effluence can corrode and weaken the screw
according to the ¡¬ 311 patent the claimed bone_screw has a cylindrical_body_portion and a shoulder_portion 184 that act as a sort of stopper blocking effluence from leaking out of the bone
claim 5 of the ¡¬311_patent recites a bone_screw for connecting a bone_portion with a bone connecting member said bone_screw comprising an elongated shank having a longitudinal central axis a first externally threaded portion for receiving an internally threaded nut and a second externally threaded portion for threaded engagement with a surface defining an opening in the bone_portion to attach the bone_screw to the bone_portion ; and
means integral with said shank and having a transverse cross-section at least equal to the transverse cross-section of the opening in the bone_portion for projecting into the opening and for engaging a portion of the surface defining the opening in the bone_portion to restrict movement of said bone_screw relative to the bone_portion in a direction transverse to the longitudinal *1377 central axis of said shank and to block effluence from the opening in the bone_portion said means being located intermediate said first externally threaded portion and said second externally threaded portion

dr._steffee and another colleague founded acromed in 1983
dr._steffee assigned all of his rights in the ¡¬290 and ¡¬311_patent s to acromed
in 1988 cri disbanded and mr._janson went to work at acromed
when mr._janson began working for acromed he completed an employment agreement requiring him to disclose any pre-existing invention in which he had an interest
mr._janson checked the box marked` employee has no such property' and signed that agreement

mr._janson worked as a machinist at acromed until 1992 and then continued as a consultant for acromed until june 1994
in june 1994 mr._janson met with daneks counsel on two occasions
later that year acromed requested mr._janson to sign a declaration and power of attorney to add him as a co-inventor of the ¡¬290_patent
acromed also requested mr._janson to assign his rights in the ¡¬290_patent if he signed the declaration
mr._janson declined to sign either the declaration or the assignment
instead on january 25 1995 mr._janson signed an agreement with danek to assign his` patent rights' to danek for $ 150,000

acromed first sued danek for infringement of the ¡¬290_patent by daneks` luque' system in 1988
the luque was a semi-constrained plate-and-screw_system without a way to hold the screws completely rigid to the plate
in march 1989 the parties entered a settlement agreement whereby acromed granted danek a limited license under the ¡¬290_patent
in return danek paid acromed a license fee until 1996

in 1992 danek changed its technology into a constrained system
danek developed several constrained systems including the` dyna-lok' and` z-plate' systems
in june 1993 acromed again filed suit claiming that daneks dyna-lok z-plate and various other spine_plate systems infringe the ¡¬311 and ¡¬ 290 patents
danek counterclaimed that acromeds ¡¬290_patent is invalid for failure to name mr._janson as an inventor
danek further counterclaimed that acromeds ¡¬311_patent is invalid due to anticipation by united_states_patent_no._3554,193 to ilias konstantinou konstantinou_patent

as depicted below the konstantinou_patent discloses a hip-pinning device for repair of hip fractures
the device uses a lag_screw to attach a bone_plate to the upper region of a femur
the lag_screw has a rounded_head_portion 38 that permits the screw to be angularly displaced within a hole in a bone_plate
a surgeon can thus vary the angle at which he attaches the screw to the bone while maintaining the plate in a desired location

*1378. ?
after a ten-day jury trial the district_court judge granted acromeds motion for jmol that the ¡¬290_patent was not invalid for improper_inventorship
the jury returned a verdict that daneks dyna-lok and z-plate spine_plates infringed the asserted claims of the ¡¬290_patent
the jury further found that daneks dyna-lok and z-plate 5.5 mm bone bolts infringed claims 5 10 14 and 16 of the ¡¬311_patent and that daneks dyna-lok and z-plate larger diameter bone bolts infringed claims 5 10 12 13 14 and 16
the jury additionally found all asserted claims of both the ¡¬290 and ¡¬311_patent to be neither anticipated nor obvious over prior_art
the jury awarded acromed $ 32,913,444 in damages and found that danek had willfully infringed the ¡¬290_patent

after the jury_verdict danek renewed its motions for jmol that the ¡¬290_patent is invalid for omitting an inventor that its spine_plates and screws do not infringe the ¡¬311_patent and that the konstantinou_patent anticipates the ¡¬311_patent
the district_court denied all of these motions
the district_court then increased the damages to $ 47,806,701 to account for post-verdict damages and prejudgment interest
danek appealed

danek asserts that mr._janson conceived the arcuate_recesses recited in claim 1 of the ¡¬290_patent
danek argues that mr._jansons testimony that he invented the arcuate_recesses and the conical_nut is sufficient_evidence of conception and contribution
the record however contains no evidence to corroborate this assertion

mr._janson testified that he conceived of a conical_nut and arcuate_recesses to prevent sliding movement of a spine_plate *1380 before dr._steffee ever mentioned problems with plate sliding
mr._janson further testified that he was the first to conceive of a spine_plate with slots and the first to conceive of transforming regular_bone_screws into machine-threaded screws to accept a slotted_plate
in other words according to mr._janson he conceived of the entire plate-and-screw combination
danek however was not able to put forth other witnesses dated drawings or any other evidence to verify mr._jansons assertions
in fact mr._janson himself admitted that he did not communicate his conceptions to anyone

on appeal danek argues that dr._steffees own testimony corroborates mr._jansons claims of conceiving the arcuate_recesses
in particular danek quotes the following deposition testimony made by dr._steffee i have always said frank_jansen [ sic ] was the one who put the nests in the slots thats the only thing that frank_jansen [ sic ] did
and i was right there when he asked me if he could do it

.
.
.
.
.
he and i were standing there together he asked me if he could put the drill press down and put those nest in and i said fine it sounds like a good idea lets do it

acromed concedes that mr._janson cut the arcuate_recesses into the spine_plate
countersinking the slots in the spine_plate however was not an inventive_conception
the record in context supports the district_courts conclusion that dr._steffee alone conceived the invention
specifically dr._steffee testified that when he brought the slotted_plate and conical_nut to mr._janson he explained` when i drive the nut down i have to have it so it sinks in and stays right there'
dr._steffee thus instructed mr._janson to design the plate according to his conception
mr._jansons work of putting arcuate_recesses in the slots` was simply the exercise of the normal skill expected of an ordinary' machinist
sewall 21 f.3d at 416
danek having had the burden of proof at trial did not present adequate evidence to suggest otherwise
as explained by the district_court` danek could have countered this by producing testimony at trial concerning what would or would not be obvious to one ordinarily skilled in the art of making plates
danek never did'

danek argues that the prosecution history of the ¡¬290_patent provides clear and convincing_evidence that the arcuate_recesses were an inventive_conception
during prosecution of the ¡¬290_patent at the united states patent and trademark office the patent examiner rejected claim 1 as obvious over prior_art
in its response acromed explained that the prior_art did not` disclose or suggest an elongated_plate with an elongated_slot therein having arcuate_recesses in the slot'
acromed further explained that the prior_art plates actually permitted sliding movement instead of the` blocking' it as recited in claim 1
contrary to daneks contentions acromed did not assert that the arcuate_recesses alone rendered claim 1 patentable
rather acromed observed that the combination of an elongated_plate with slots having arcuate_recesses blocked sliding movements

danek further argues that the arcuate_recesses are the sole feature that makes claim 1 patentable over prior_art cited during trial to invalidate the ¡¬ 290 patent for obviousness
these prior_art_references however do not provide substantial_evidence that mr._jansons countersinking *1381 of the elongated_slots was more than the work of an ordinarily skilled machinist following instructions

claim 1 of the ¡¬290_patent is a combination claim
this court has long established that` [ c ] ombination claims can consist of new combinations of old_elements.. for it may be that the combination of the old_elements is novel and patentable'

virtually all inventions are combinations and virtually all are combinations of old_elements`
in fact all of the elements in claim 1 appear in the prior_art
for example the ¡¬290 spine_plate was modeled after the eggers plate a plate with elongated_slots
a patent cited by danek great britain patent no._780652 discloses plates for spinal fixation that are designed to prevent relative movement between fastening bolts and the plates
in fact united_states_patent_no._3596,656 cited by the examiner during prosecution shows that arcuate_recesses or countersinking around a hole in a plate appeared in prior_art as early as the 1960s
claim 1 however combined these various old features to produce a new and nonobvious invention
the entire combination not the arcuate_recesses alone renders claim 1 patentable

without corroborating evidence danek did not present clear and convincing_evidence at trial that mr._jansons countersinking of the elongated_slots was an inventive_conception
thus the record contains sufficient_evidence to support the judgment that the ¡¬290_patent withstood challenges to its validity based on excluding mr._janson as an inventor

infringement
the district_court interpreted claim 5 of the ¡¬311_patent as a means-plus-function_claim
the district_court next construed the` means integral' as the body_portion and tapering_shoulder_portion of the screw
the trial_court then defined` engaging' as` fitting together'
danek argues that the district_courts claim_construction is incorrect and that under the correct claim_construction four of the five allegedly infringing screws do not infringe

danek asserts that` engaging' requires the narrow construction that the body_portion of the screw forces cancellous bone tissue forward and radially outward into the thread space left behind by the screw thread or the tap
according to danek its four screws with a thread diameter larger than 5.5 mm can not push bone with their body_portions during insertion because this screw thread diameter is larger than the diameter of the screw body_portion
daneks expert dr. pope testified that these screws would not` ram in' and` displace material upwards and outwards' as described in the ¡¬311_patent

the word` engage' means` to interlock' or` mesh'
websters ii new riverside university dictionary 433 1988
this meaning matches the district_courts construction that` engage' means to` fit together'
the written description of the ¡¬311_patent does not depart from or narrow this meaning
the ¡¬311_patent uses` engage' to define three interfaces 1 threaded engagement of the screw threads with the bone_opening` to attach the bone_screw to the bone' col. 2 ll.1 68-69 ; claims 1 5 10 15_and_16 ; 2 engagement *1382 of the body_portion with a portion of the surface defining the bone_opening` to restrict movement of the bone_screw' and to block` fluid flow from the opening of the bone' col._3,_ll._8-12 ; claims 4 5 15_and_16 ; and 3 engagement of the seat_portion top plane of the screws body_portion with the connecting member e.g. the spine_plate` to establish the axial location of the connecting member along the bone_screw' col._3,_ll._19-21 ; claims 14_and_16
these three uses of the term require a meaning broad enough to apply to each of these interfaces
digital biometrics inc. v. identix inc. 149_f.3d_1335 1345 fed.cir.1998` [ t ] he same word appearing in the same claim should be interpreted consistently
`` ; fonar corp. v. johnson & johnson 821_f.2d_627 632 3_uspq2d_1109 1113 fed.cir.1987 holding that the meaning of a term in a claim must be consistent with its appearance in other claims in the same patent

contrary to daneks assertion` engage' can not mean only` to push material forward and outward'
in engaging a connecting member one of the uses of the term the seat_portion of the screw does not push any part of the connecting member forward and outward
accordingly the interpretation` fitting together' best accommodates the various usages of the term in the patent
thus the seat_portion of the screw has a flat surface that` fits together' with a spine_plate to axially locate the spine_plate along the bone_screw
likewise the body_portion and tapering_shoulder_portions` fit together' with the surrounding bone to restrict movement of the bone_screw and to block effluence from the opening in the bone_portion

further contrary to daneks assertions construing` engage' as` fit together' does not impede the function of the claims
even if the body_portion does not completely block all of the thread gaps left in the bone by the threaded portion the tapered_shoulder_portion of these screws is wider in diameter and does block the bone_opening thereby restricting effluence

danek also argues that the asserted claims require a screw with a body_portion having a diameter equal to or greater than the crest_diameter of the threaded portion because such a screw is disclosed in the written description
the written description does disclose a screw with a body_portion` having a diameter d1 which is substantially equal to the crest_diameter d2 of the threaded portion.. and thus is larger than [ the root diameter of the tap ]'
col._8,_ll._19-23

in construing a means-plus-function limitation a court must identify both the claimed function and the corresponding structure in the written description for performing that function
micro chem. inc. v. great plains chem co. 194_f.3d_1250 1258 52_uspq2d_1258 1263 fed.cir.1999
under 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
6 a court may not import into the claim structural limitations from the written description that are unnecessary to perform the claimed function
id
in this case the district_court correctly identified` blocking effluence and restricting transverse_movement' as the recited functions
the trial_court then correctly concluded that the body_portion 182 and the shoulder_portion 184 perform these two functions together
to limit the body_portion to a diameter at least as large as the crest_diameter of the second externally threaded portion would be to impermissibly import into the claim limitation specific dimensions of a preferred embodiment that are unnecessary to perform the claimed function of blocking effluence and restricting transverse_movement
*1383 this court will not limit a patent to its preferred embodiments in the face of evidence of broader coverage by the claims

``

danek seeks to avoid infringement by attacking the trial_courts claim_construction
because the district_courts claim_construction is correct this court finds sufficient_evidence for the jury to find infringement of the ¡¬ 311 patents claims by all of the accused bone_screws

anticipation
danek argues that if the asserted claims of the ¡¬311_patent cover a body_portion with a diameter less than the diameter of the thread a reasonable_jury would have found that the lag_screw disclosed in the konstantinou_patent anticipates the claims of the ¡¬311_patent
in particular danek asserts that the shank portion 92 and the head portion 90 of the konstantinou_screw are the` means integral' recited in the claims of the ¡¬311_patent
danek further argues that the konstantinou_screw would perform the` engaging' function as recited in the ¡¬311_patents claims

normally to invalidate a patent by anticipation a prior_art_reference needs to disclose each and every limitation of the claim

claim 5 recites that the` means integral' has the function of both projecting into the bone_opening and engaging a portion of the bone_opening surface
the district_court construed` means integral' as including both the body_portion and the tapered_shoulder of the screw
to anticipate the konstantinou_patent must disclose either directly or inherently a body_portion and a tapered_shoulder that project into the bone_opening restrict movement of the bone_screw and block effluence
konstantinou does not disclose these functions
danek therefore had the burden of putting forth evidence that made` clear that the missing descriptive matter is necessarily present in the..

while the long shank in the konstantinou_screw may serve as a body_portion this shank directly abuts the rounded_head_portion without a tapering_shoulder
danek urges that the lower half of the konstantinou_screw head meets the written description of the shoulder_portion in the ¡¬311_patent` [ a ] tapering circular surface with a diameter which increases as the shoulder_portion extends in a direction from the body_portion toward the seat_portion'
acromed however put forth evidence of figures in the konstantinou_patent itself as well as the testimony of its expert dr. katz to show that the konstantinou_screw does not have a tapering_shoulder

furthermore the record does not show that the rounded head of the konstantinou_screw could act as a shoulder to necessarily *1384 project into the bone_opening or play any role in restricting screw movement or blocking effluence
acromed actually put forth expert testimony and the konstantinou_patent itself to demonstrate that the head of the konstantinou_screw remains outside of the cortical_bone
without sufficient record evidence for the jury to find that the konstantinou_patent disclosed the` means integral' as recited in the claims of the ¡¬311_patent the district_court did not err in declining to grant jmol that the konstantinou_patent anticipates the ¡¬311_patent

conclusion
this court affirms all of the district_courts judgments in the present case
