reyna circuit_judge
*1016 plaintiffs-appellants_teva_pharmaceuticals_usa inc. teva_pharmaceutical_industries ltd. teva_neuroscience inc. and yeda_research and development_co. ltd. appeal the decision of the united_states_district_court for the district of delaware invalidating all asserted_claims of patents directed to copaxonethe_r_40mg/ml a product marketed for treatment of patients with relapsing forms of multiple_sclerosis
because the district_court correctly held the asserted_claims invalid as obvious under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 we affirm.1

background
i
patents at issue
yeda_research & development_co. ltd. is the assignee of u.s._patent_nos._8232,250 8,399,413 8,969,302 and 9,155,776 the250413302 and776_patent respectively all entitled` low frequency glatiramer_acetate therapy'
the patents collectively referred to as the` copaxone_patents' share a common specification and claim priority to the same two provisional applications
j.a
57-69
the earliest priority_date of the copaxone_patents is august 20 2009
j.a
23

*1017 the copaxone_patents describe and claim copaxonethe_r_40mg/ml a treatment for relapsing-remitting multiple_sclerosis` rrms'
rrms is a form of multiple_sclerosis an autoimmune disorder that causes the bodys immune_system to attack the central nervous system
rrms is characterized by unpredictable relapses followed by periods of remission with no new signs of disease_activity

the active ingredient in copaxonethe_r_40mg/ml is glatiramer acetate` ga' a synthetic mixture of polypeptides
ga is also known as` copolymer 1' or` cop
1'
copaxonethe_r_40mg/ml is supplied as a single-dose prefilled syringe
broadly the treatment consists of the injection of 40mg of ga three times a week abbreviated` 40mg_ga_3x/week'
relevant to this appeal side_effects of ga injections include injection-site reactions` isrs' and immediate post-injection_reactions` ipirs'
isrs are physical symptoms at the injection_site such as swelling or itchiness
ipirs are reactions immediately following an injection such as flushes sweating or palpitations

prior to copaxonethe_r_40mg/ml in 1996 the food and drug administration` fda' approved copaxonethe_r 20mg/ml a regimen consisting of the daily injection of 20mg_ga. daily ga injections were known to subject patients to discomfort including side_effects in the form of isrs and ipirs
j.a
20692

for analyzing the obviousness of the copaxone_patents in this case a key limitation of the asserted_claims is the administration of a 40mg_ga_dose in three subcutaneous_injections over seven days
claim 1 of the250_patent is representative 1
a method of alleviating a symptom of relapsing-remitting multiple_sclerosis in a human_patient_suffering from relapsing-remitting multiple_sclerosis or a patient who has experienced a first_clinical_episode and is determined to be at high_risk of developing clinically definite_multiple_sclerosis_comprising administering to the human_patient a therapeutically effective_regimen of three subcutaneous_injections of a 40 mg_dose of glatiramer acetate over a period of seven days with at least one day between every subcutaneous_injection the regimen being sufficient to alleviate the symptom of the patient
'250_patent col. 16_ll._35 -45

apart from claim 1 of the302_patent2 all asserted in-dependent_claims require at least one day between doses
'250_patent col. 16_ll._35 -45 col. 17_l._25 -col. 18_l._6 ;413_patent col. 16_ll._26 -36 col. 18_ll._14 -28 ;302_patent col. 17_ll._4 -12 ;776_patent col. 16_ll._35 -50 col. 16_l._61 -col. 17_l._19 col. 17_ll._37 -54 col. 17_l._65 -col. 18_l._22
certain dependent_claims of the250413 and776_patent s further require improved tolerability and/or reduced_frequency of injection_reactions in the claimed regimen as compared to a 20mg_ga daily regimen
see e.g.250_patent col. 17_ll._21 -24 col. 18_ll._7 -15 ;413_patent col. 16_ll._51 -54 ;776_patent col. 16_ll._51 -54 col 17_l._65 -col. 18_l._25

the776_patent contains additional limitations namely the requirement that the 40mg_ga_3x/week_regimen` reduce [ ] severity of injection_site_reactions' compared to a 20mg_daily_regimen as seen in claim 1 *1018 1
a method of treating a human_patient_suffering from a relapsing form of multiple_sclerosis while inducing reduced_severity of injection_site_reactions in the human_patient relative to administration of 20 mg of glatiramer acetate s.c. daily the method consisting of one subcutaneous_injection of 1 ml of a pharmaceutical_composition comprising 40 mg of glatiramer acetate on only each of three days during each week of treatment with at least one day without a subcutaneous_injection of the pharmaceutical_composition between each day on which there is a subcutaneous_injection wherein the pharmaceutical_composition is in a prefilled syringe and wherein the pharmaceutical_composition further comprises mannitol and has a ph in the range 5.big_token__5_to_7__big_token0 so as to thereby treat the human_patient with reduced_severity of injection_site_reactions relative to administration of 20 mg of glatiramer acetate s.c. daily

prior art references
the first clinical_trial for using ga to treat multiple_sclerosis took place in 1987 by dr. bornstein et al
(` bornstein'3 which was followed by a teva phase iii clinical_trial in 1995
both bornstein and the phase_iii_trial tested 20mg_ga daily
j.a
20378-84 20464-20782
since ga was developed in an expedited manner under orphan drug status in the united_states at a time when no other disease modifying multiple_sclerosis treatments were available the 20mg/day dose was selected without performing conventional optimal-dose-finding studies
j.a
24967

the bornstein study showed that ga administered subcutaneously for two years at a daily dose of 20mg` produced clinically important and statistically significant beneficial effects'
j.a
20383
participants in both bornstein and the phase_iii_trial reported isrs and ipirs as side_effects
j.a
20383 20480
the phase_iii_trial noted` adverse experience' as the main reason contributing to patient dropout and` [ t ] he most common adverse event associated with dropout was injection_site reaction'
j.a
20480
a phase_iii_trial reviewer made recommendations for future researchers to explore dose-response and dose-ranging studies asking` is 20 mg the optimum dose ?
are daily_injections necessary ?'
j.a
20502

in 1996 following both bornstein and the phase iii clinical_trial fda approved tevas new drug application` nda' for copaxonethe_r 20mg 20mg_ga injected daily
in its 1996 summary basis of approval` sboa' fda recommended that teva` evaluate the necessity of daily [ ga ] injections as opposed to more infrequent intermit-tent administration of the drug' because the daily_dosing_regimen` seems like it would subject the patient to an excessive amount of discomfort if it is not necessary to maintain efficacy'
j.a
20692

a 2002 study by flechter et al.4` flechter' evaluated the treatment of rrms with 20mg of ga administered every other_day
j.a
20436-40
flechter concluded that` alternate-day treatment with copolymer 1 is safe well tolerated and probably as effective as daily copolymer 1 in reducing relapse_rate and slowing neurologic *1019 deterioration'
j.a
20440
flechter also noted that patient dropout rates decreased when ga was administered every other_day as opposed to daily
j.a
20440` it should be stressed that the dropout rate was lower in the alternate-day_group than in the daily-injection regime 39.7 % versus 60.3 % p < 0.01
``

cohen,5 published in 2007 was a` double-blind dose-comparison study of glatiramer acetate in relapsing-remitting ms.' j.a
20388-95
cohen compared daily_subcutaneous_injections of 20mg and 40mg_ga dosages and concluded that the 40mg_dose may be` more effective' than the 20mg_dose` in reducing mri_activity and clinical_relapses'
j.a
20389
cohen also noted that the onset of action of the 40mg_dose is more rapid compared to 20mg
j.a
20394
isrs were the most frequent adverse event for both doses occurring at roughly equal rates
j.a
20392-93
ipirs occurred more frequently in the 40mg_group than the 20mg_group
id
cohen thus concluded that the overall safety and side effect profile of the 40mg_dose was` similar' to the 20mg_dose but` was associated with a greater incidence of certain adverse effects'
j.a
20394

tevas own prior_art patent application international patent application no
wo 2007/081975 method of treating multiple_sclerosis` pinchasi' was published shortly after the cohen study
j.a
20925-56
pinchasi discloses a 40mg_ga every other_day dosing_regimen for the treatment of rrms
pinchasi cites to the data from cohen to conclude that` [ t ] he increased efficacy observed with 40 mg/day ga in reducing mri-measured disease_activity and relapse_rate indicates that it is well tolerated and can improve the treatment of rrms patients
the improvement in efficacy however is not accompanied by a corresponding_increase of adverse_reactions which would be expected upon a doubling of the administered dose'
j.a
20944

the forte_study,6 published in 2008 evaluated the safety tolerability and efficacy of 40mg_ga compared to 20mg_ga. j.a
20411 20414-22
forte concluded that both the 40mg and 20mg_doses` were equally effective in reducing clinical_relapses and mri_activity' and that the 40mg_dose has a` safety profile similar to that observed in previous studies of 20mg_ga.' j.a
20411
forte also confirmed cohens finding that the 40mg_dose provided an earlier onset of action
j.a
20422 noting a` [ t ] rend for an earlier effect of high [ 40mg ] dose on mri_activity'

a 2008 study by omar khan and others7` khan 2008' compared the effect of daily versus every other_day_administration of 20mg_ga subcutaneous_injections for the treatment of rrms
j.a
20883
the study_abstract noted that although the recommended dose for treating rrms is daily 20mg_ga injections` the optimal_dose remains unknown' and that there is` considerable_interest in alternate dosing_regimens of ga' because daily_injections` can be challenging for long-term patient *1020 compliance'
j.a
20883
thirty patients were randomly assigned to receive 20mg_ga_dosed daily or every other_day
after two years there were` no differences' between the two groups in relapse_rate or disease progression
j.a
20883
additionally after the first two years elapsed patients in each group were given the option to continue or switch groups and were monitored for an additional two years
every patient in the daily_group opted to switch to every other_day_administration
after four years there was no difference between the crossover group and the group that was always dosed every other_day
the caon reference,8 published in 2009 reports the same data from the khan 2008 study but further noted that` [ i ] njection related lipoatrophy was significantly less' in the every other_day_group
j.a
20386

state of the art references
there are two additional references relevant to this appeal a 2009 study by omar khan9` khan 2009' and tevas own glatiramer_acetate low-frequency administration` gala' phase_iii_trial of 40mg_ga administered three times per week
j.a
23904-05 j.a
8246-8417
khan 2009 and gala were both published after august 20 2009 the priority_date of the asserted patents and thus do not qualify as statutory_prior_art

the district_court admitted the khan 2009 reference for the limited_purpose of showing the state of the art at the time of the invention
in re copaxone_consolidated_cases no._14-1171-_gms 2017_wl_401943 at *14 d. del
jan._30,_2017
khan 2009 was published three weeks after august 20 2009 the priority_date of the copaxone_patents but the study began two years earlier
j.a
23904-05
the study_abstract noted that` [ t ] here is considerable_interest in studying a more patient friendly dosing_regimen of ga that may be as efficacious and better tolerated than daily ga.' j.a
23904
following the results of khan 2008 which showed that alternate day administration of ga appears to be as effective as daily administration khan 2009_compared_20 mg_ga administered twice a week to 20mg_ga administered daily in a pilot prospective randomized and rater-blinded two-year study
j.a
23904

concerning gala the district_court recognized that the gala trial protocol does not qualify as prior_art
in re copaxone 2017_wl_401943 at *20
instead the district_court admitted gala as an admission by teva to inform on the motivations of those having ordinary_skill in the art at the time of the invention
in its submission to fda teva explained that after the forte_study demonstrated that the 40mg_dose was equally effective as the 20mg_dose` the natural next step [ was ] to reduce the dosing_regimen of ga and find the optimal regimen that [ would ] improve the convenience of treatment and reduce the burden and adverse_events associated with daily_subcutaneous_injections'
j.a
8266
citing the small-scale studies with 20mg_ga in the prior_art such as khan 2008 gala noted that results` demonstrated effects in relapse_rate reduction which were comparable to daily_injections *1021 of ga 20mg suggesting a lower injection frequency can be considered'
j.a
8266 8352
the gala_protocol selected a dosing_regimen of 40mg_ga_3x/week in part because` the subjects will receive approximately the same_weekly_dose given by 3 subcutaneous_injections instead of with a daily injection frequency of 7 injections'
j.a

iv
proceeding below
this appeal arises out of five consolidated district_court cases
the defendants-appellees in this case are generic_drug_manufacturers who prior to the expiration of the copaxone_patents submitted abbreviated new drug applications` andas' to fda for approval to engage in the manufacture and sale of generic versions of copaxonethe_r_40mg administered 3 times per week

appellants_teva_pharmaceuticals_usa inc. teva_pharmaceutical_industries ltd. teva_neuroscience inc. and yeda_research and development_co. ltd. collectively` teva' sued appellees in the united_states_district_court for the district of delaware alleging that their respective anda filings infringed claims 1 5 13-17 of the250_patent claims 1 7 15 and 20 of the413_patent claims 1 10 and 11 of the302_patent and claims 1 2 5 6 9 12 16 and 17 of the776_patent
id

following a markman hearing the district_court entered a claim_construction_order
in re copaxone 40 mg no._14-1171-_gms 2016_wl_873062 at *1-2 mar._7,_2016` claim_construction_order'
relevant to this appeal the district_court construed the250 and413_patent s` sufficiency' 10 terms and the776_patents` reduced_frequency of relapses' 11 and` effectiveness' 12 terms as non-limiting statements of intended effect
id.at *1 & nn.1-2

the district_court held a seven-day bench trial during which it considered the invalidity of the asserted_claims of the copaxone_patents
the district_court found that a 40mg_ga_dose was explicitly disclosed in references that predate the copaxone_patents specifically cohen pinchasi and forte
in re copaxone 2017_wl_401943 at *14
the court rejected tevas arguments that cohen and forte taught away from a 40mg_dose and that a person of ordinary_skill in the art` posita' would have thought that 20mg was the optimal_dose
id.at *14-15
the district_court also found that as of the priority_date positas knew that daily_injections were difficult to tolerate based on the 1996 fda_sboa flechter and khan 2008
id.at *15-16
relying in part on trial_testimony the district_court found that positas were familiar with the adverse_reactions pain and treatment_adherence_problems associated with daily_injections and would have been motivated to pursue less frequent dosing with a reasonable probability of success
id.at *16
the district_court found that pinchasi is the closest_prior_art because it discloses a dosing_regimen that differs from the claimed regimen by only one dose every two weeks
id.at *17

in light of these factual_findings the district_court concluded that a 40mg_ga_3x/week dosage would be obvious to try *1022 noting that there were only two tested dosage_amounts in the prior_art-20mg and 40mg-and that researchers were pursuing less frequent_dosing_regimens while recognizing there are a limited_number of days in a week on which to test frequency
see id.at *19
the court recognized that obvious-to-try logic is not always appropriate but found that` [ h ] ere there was market_pressure to solve a known problem-the fact that many ms patients could not tolerate daily_injections-and there were a finite_number of predictable_solutions that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have good_reason to pursue'
id
the district_court cited to khan 2009 tevas gala study and trial_testimony as evidence of the motivations of positas at the time of the invention and noted evidence and testimony supporting the proposition that a dosing schedule based on three predetermined days each week is preferable for patients over an every other_day schedule
id.at *20
the district_court highlighted testimony from dr._green that a regimen of injections on three pre-determined days of each week is more convenient for patients and has better patient_adherence than an every other_day_regimen in which the days on which patients inject differ depending on the week
id
the district_court also noted a study showing that rebifthe_r an injectable ms treatment dosed three times a week has increased patient_adherence compared to the daily 20mg_ga_regimen
id

in light of additional testimony that a posita would expect the number of isrs to decrease as the number of injections per week decreased as well as disclosures in flechter khan 2008 and caon the district_court held obvious the dependent_claims of the250 and413_patent s requiring that the 40mg_ga_3x/week_regimen reduce the frequency of isrs and ipirs as compared to a 20mg/day_regimen
id.at *17-18
the district_court also found obvious claim 15 of the250_patent which requires the claimed method improve tolerability as compared to a 20mg/day_regimen
id.at *17
the court further determined the claims of the776_patent to be obvious in light of caon and expert evidence presented at trial
id.at *22-23
finally the court considered objective_indicia of nonobviousness and concluded that none of them war-ranted a finding of nonobviousness of the copaxone_patents
id.at *25

following its analysis the district_court held all asserted_claims of the copaxone_patents invalid as obvious under ¡± 103
teva appeals the district_courts claim_construction and obviousness decisions
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

discussion

claim construction
claim construction seeks to ascribe the` ordinary and customary meaning' to claim terms as a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have understood them at the time of invention

cir
2005 en banc citing vitronics corp. v. conceptronic inc. 90_f.3d_1576 1582 fed
cir
1996
where the district_courts claim_construction relies only on intrinsic evidence as is the case here the construction is a legal determination reviewed de novo

2016 citing teva pharm usa inc. v. sandoz inc. -- - u.s. -- -- 135_s.ct._831 841 -- - l.ed.2d -- -- 2015

teva contends that the district_court erroneously construed certain claim terms as non-limiting and disregarded them for nonobviousness purposes
teva points to the` sufficiency' terms of the250 and413_patent s as being limiting
claim 1 of *1023 the250_patent recites` a method of alleviating a symptom of relapsing-remitting multiple_sclerosis.. comprising administering to the human_patient a therapeutically effective_regimen.. the regimen being sufficient to alleviate the symptom of the patient'
'250_patent col. 16_ll._35 -45 emphasis added
similarly claims 1_and_20 of the413_patent both recite` [ a ] method.. comprising administering to the human_patient a therapeutically effective dosage regimen.. the regimen being sufficient to reduce the frequency of relapses in the patient'
'413_patent col. 16_ll._26 -36 col. 18_ll._14 -27 emphasis added
teva also contests the district_courts construction of the` reduced_frequency of relapse' terms and` effectiveness' terms in the776_patent as non-limiting
for example claim 5 of the776_patent describes` a method for reducing the frequency of relapses' ; claims 6 16 and 17 contain similar_limitations
'776_patent col. 16_ll._61 -65 col. 17_ll._20 -22 65-66 col. 18_ll._23 -25
claim 12 describes` [ a ] method for improving the tolerability of glatiramer acetate treatment of a human_patient_suffering from a relapsing form of multiple_sclerosis which is as effective as administration of 20 mg of glatiramer acetate s.c. daily' and claims 16_and_17 contain similar_limitations
id
col. 17_ll._36 -40 emphasis added col. 17_l._65 -col. 18_l._5 col. 18_ll._23 -25

the district_court construed these terms to be non-limiting statements of intended effect holding that those terms are` strikingly similar to those in the patents in bristol-myers squibb co. v. ben venue laboratories inc. 246_f.3d_1368_(fed._cir._2001)'
claim_construction_order 2016_wl_873062 at *2 n.2
in bristol-myers the court held that certain terms were non-limiting because they` merely express [ ed ] a purpose' and` only state [ d ] an intended result of the claimed method'
246 f.3d at 1374-75
the court stated that express dosage_amounts are material claim limitations but statements of intended results from their administration such as` an antineo-plastically effective amount'` does not change those amounts or otherwise limit the claim'
id.at 1375
claim language without any bearing on the claimed methods should be deemed non-limiting when it does not result in` a manipulative_difference in the steps of the claim'
id.at 1376

we see no meaningful difference between the claims in bristol-myers and those at issue here
the phrase` the regimen being sufficient to reduce the frequency of relapses in the patient' does not change the express dosing amount or method already disclosed in the claims or otherwise result in a manipulative_difference in the steps of the claims
the claims are clear that the dosing has to be` therapeutically effective_regimen' ; the addition of` the regimen being sufficient to' be therapeutically effective is superfluous does not change the claimed method or require any additional required structure or condition for the claims and is therefore non-limiting

teva argues that the`sufficiency terms were added during prosecution to overcome rejections'
appellants opening_br
74
teva overstates the intrinsic record
claim 1 of the250_patent was amended to overcome a ¡± 112 rejection based on the examiners read of the claims prior to amendment as permitting only a single seven-day_period of administration rather than an ongoing treatment regimen

we address each argument in turn

*big_token__1025_a._40__big_token mg_ga_3x/week dosing regimen
teva contends that the district_court erred in finding the claimed 40mg_ga_3x/week_dosing_regimen obvious
specifically teva argues that the district_court impermissibly relied on hindsight and an improper` obvious to try' analysis and analyzed the obviousness of individual claim elements rather than the invention as a whole
teva further maintains that the district_courts decision is at odds with this courts decision in in re cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsule patent litigation 676_f.3d_1063_(fed._cir._2012)

we first address tevas contention that the district_court engaged in an impermissible` obvious to try' analysis
in ksr the supreme court endorsed the use of an` obvious to try' analysis in certain cases when there is a design need or market_pressure to solve a problem and there are a finite_number of identified predictable_solutions a person of ordinary_skill has good_reason to pursue the known options within his or her technical grasp
if this leads to the anticipated success it is likely the product not of innovation but of ordinary_skill and common_sense
in that instance the fact that a combination was obvious to try might show that it was obvious under ¡± 103
ksr int l co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 421 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007)

we have previously identified two categories of impermissible` obvious to try' analyses that run afoul of ksr and ¡± 103 when what was` obvious to try' was a to vary all parameters or try every available option until one succeeds where the prior_art gave no indication of critical parameters and no direction as to which of many possibilities is likely to be successful ; or b to explore a new technology or general approach in a seemingly promising field of experimentation where the prior_art gave only general guidance as to the particular form or method of achieving the claimed invention
see in re kubin 561_f.3d_1351 1359 fed
cir
2009 quoting in re o'farrell 853_f.2d_894 903 fed
cir
1988

this case falls into neither of the two impermissible categories
here the prior_art focused on two critical variables dose size and injection frequency and provided clear direction as to choices likely to be successful in reducing adverse side_effects and increasing patient_adherence
as of the priority_date only two ga dose sizes had been shown to be effective safe and well-tolerated 20mg and 40mg
concerning frequency the 1996 fda_sboa flechter and khan 2008 all encouraged positas to pursue a less frequent than daily_dosing_regimen ; these references indicated that less frequent_injections of ga were just as effective as daily_injections and less frequent_injections improved patient_adherence and reduced adverse_reactions
the district_court also properly relied on khan 2009 not as statutory_prior_art but for the fact that positas were interested in pursuing less frequent_dosing_regimens
in re copaxone 2017_wl_401943 at *14

given this motivation a posita had only a limited_number of permutations of dose and frequency to explore that were not already disclosed in the prior_art
because a thrice-weekly 40mg injection would result in a total_weekly_dose very close to that in the already-approved daily 20mg injection-120mg/week versus 140mg/week-the district_court found a posita would have had a reasonable_expectation of success in pursuing the thrice-weekly dose frequency in terms of effectiveness patient_adherence and fda_approval

cir
2013` the potential for fda_approval also may properly be considered as it was here in determining whether one of ordinary_skill would be motivated to develop a drug product and whether there was skepticism regarding the efficacy of such a product'
)
the district_court gave appropriate weight to the testimony of dr._green regarding patient compliance with thrice-weekly administrations and the rebifthe_r regimen noting that` [ e ] ven though rebifthe_r is a different ms drug with a different mechanism of action.. those in the art would still be motivated to try dosing ga three times a week based on the higher rates of patient_adherence to the rebifthe_r_therapy'
id.at *20

teva faults the district_court for` narrowing the universe' of possible ga regimens and using hindsight and the gala_protocol to reach its obviousness_conclusion
appellants opening_br
42 arguing the district_court limited a posita to` two dosing options 40mg and 20mg two regimens 1x/week and 3x/week and one form injections'
we disagree ; the district_court had ample evidence besides hindsight and the disclosures in gala on which to find a thrice-weekly dosing_regimen of 40mg_ga obvious to try
see in re copaxone 2017_wl_401943 at *17-22
although the universe of potential ga doses is theoretically unlimited the universe of dosages in the prior_art that had clinical support for being effective and safe consisted of only two doses 20mg and 40mg
even if there were multiple injection frequencies not yet tested in the prior_art-1x 2x 3x a week etc.-these still represent a limited_number of discrete permutations

this is not a situation where the prior_art gave no direction in how to reach a successful result ; the prior_art clearly indicated that less frequent_doses should be explored i.e. moving away from the daily` 7x/week' dose towards less frequent_doses and that higher_doses while maintaining the same_weekly_dose i.e. moving from 20mg daily to 40mg every other_day could increase efficacy while not affecting adverse_reactions
further-more the district_court made factual_findings specifically in support of thrice-weekly injections
e.g. id.at *19 total_weekly_dose of 40mg_ga_3x/week is very close to the total_weekly_dose for the approved daily 20mg_ga_regimen ; id.at *20` [ a ] skilled_artisan would be motivated to try regimens close in total milligrams per week to the regimens already approved by the fda and known to be effective
`` ; id
( finding motivation to pursue a 3x/week_regimen based on patient_adherence rates in the rebifthe_r_therapy
and contrary to tevas argument that the court assumed without support that ga must be injected the district_court did not err in not considering other forms of ga
evidence considered by the district_court reveals that an oral version of copaxone was proven to be ineffective by 2005
id.at *23 ; j.a
4016
we recognize that the prior_art did not conclusively teach that a regimen of 40mg_ga_3x/week would be effective
however` [ c ] onclusive proof of efficacy is not necessary to show obviousness
all that is required is a reasonable_expectation of success'

cir
2014 ; see also in re o'farrell 853 f.2d at 903` obviousness does not require absolute predictability of success
``

nor do we find merit in tevas argument that the district_court separately analyzed the 40mg_dose limitation and the 3x/week limitation without considering them together` except to conclude that the mash-up would be obvious to try'
appellants opening_br
55
we note that the district_court spent considerable time discussing why the combination of a 40mg *1027 dose administered 3x/week would be obvious to try
see in re copaxone 2017_wl_401943 at *19
and while` [ t ] he determination of obviousness is made with respect to the subject_matter as a whole not separate pieces of the claim' sanofi-synthelabo v. apotex inc. 550_f.3d_1075 1086 fed
cir
2008 this court has previously employed the same frequency-and-dosage-amount approach to obviousness used by the district_court here
in hoffmann-la_roche 748 f.3d at 1329 the court considered whether it would have been obvious at the time of invention to select a once a month oral dosing_regimen of 150mg of ibandronate to treat osteoporosis
the court first discussed how the prior_art taught that infrequent dosing such as monthly dosing was preferred
id.at 1329-31
the court then separately discussed why a posita would have selected a 150mg_dose before considering the limitations together and concluding that` [ a ] t the very least the 150mg_dose was obvious to try'
id.at 1331-33
teva makes no convincing argument why a similar approach is inappropriate here

teva makes numerous challenges to factual_findings by the district_court none of which we find persuasive
for instance teva argues that cohen and forte teach away from using 40mg_ga
the district_court however found that the decision to include 40mg in the later forte_study indicates that cohen did not teach away from trying 40mg
in re copaxone 2017_wl_401943 at *15
the district_court further noted although the forte_study ostensibly` failed' at meeting its stated goal of establishing that 40mg/day was 30 % more effective than 20mg/day forte still found that 40mg was equally effective with` no unexpected adverse effect' and thus did not teach away
id
we see no clear_error in these findings
see galderma labs. l.p. v. tolmar inc. 737_f.3d_731 738 fed
cir
2013` a reference does not teach away however if it merely expresses a general preference for an alternative invention but does not criticize discredit or otherwise discourage investigation into the invention claimed`
nor are we swayed by tevas arguments that the district_court misread khan 2008 and caon in suggesting that patients in the 20mg/day_group switched to 20mg every other_day to reduce discomfort associated with daily_injections
the district_court cited extensive testimony clearly showing that positas` were familiar with the adverse_reactions pain and treatment_adherence_problems associated with daily_injections
`` 14 in re copaxone 2017_wl_401943 at *16
given the evidence presented the district_courts finding that patients wanted to switch to the every other_day_regimen to reduce discomfort associated with daily_injections is a reasonable conclusion and not clearly erroneous

teva further contends that the district_court erred in relying on flechter for its finding that a posita would have been motivated to pursue a less than daily_dosing_regimen
we do not reach this argument given that the district_court correctly found similar motivations in other references such as the sboa and khan 2008
*1028 teva also takes issue with the district_courts use of the pinchasi reference
although the court noted that` pinchasi is the closest_prior_art' id.at *17 this observation is not improper ; courts are required to determine` the scope and content of prior_art' and the` differences between prior_art and claims'
par pharm. 773 f.3d at 1193 emphasis added
contrary to tevas assertion that the district_court gave no reason why a person of ordinary_skill would have started with pinchasi the district_court in fact addressed pinchasi fourth in its discussion on the thrice weekly dosing limitation after the sboa flechter and khan 2008/caon references
see in re copaxone 2017_wl_401943 at *15-17
teva raises additional arguments regarding factual_findings made by the district_court none of which we find persuasive

finally this courts decision in in re cyclobenzaprine 676 f.3d at 1063 does not warrant a different outcome
teva argues that prior to the invention higher_doses of ga were not necessarily known to be more effective gas pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic` pk/pd' profile was and remains unknown gas mechanism of action is still unknown and the cause of patients reactions to injections of ga is unknown
teva contends that the unpredictable nature of ga categorically precludes the obvious-to-try analysis employed by the district_court
appellants opening_br
50

in cyclobenzaprine we held that bioequivalence alone could not establish obviousness because` skilled_artisans could not predict whether any particular pk profile including a bioequivalent one would produce a therapeutically effective_formulation'
676 f.3d at 1070
the court applied traditional motivation and reasonable-expectation-of-success analysis reasoning that` [ w ] hile it may have been obvious to experiment with the use of the same pk profile [ from an immediate-release_formulation ] when contemplating an extended-release_formulation there [ wa ] s nothing to indicate that a skilled_artisan would have had a reasonable_expectation that such an experiment would succeed in being therapeutically effective'
id
in cyclobenzaprine there were no prior_art clinical studies to suggest what would be a therapeutically effective_formulation

we do not read cyclobenzaprine as establishing a rig-id rule categorically precluding obviousness findings without pk/pd_data
further cyclobenzaprine is distinguishable in that there the obviousness proof relied entirely on the bioequivalence of certain pharmacokinetic profiles
bioequivalence is not argued here ; instead obviousness is proven through human clinical studies establishing the safety efficacy and tolerability of ga at doses and dose frequencies similar to the claimed regimen
in this case the evidence shows that pk/pd_data was largely irrelevant to the invention
numerous clinical studies in the prior_art describe ga and its effects on the human body
although the precise mechanism of ga is not known it is known to be immunomodulating-i.e. it changes the immune_system-and is not necessarily measurable in the bloodstream and its levels are not indicative of efficacy
see in re copaxone 2017_wl_401943 at *21-22 ; j.a
3998-99 4886-87
testimony was given at trial that pharmacokinetic_studies for drugs like ga are less appropriate than for small molecule drugs such as those at issue in cyclobenzaprine
j.a
4886-87
ga was also known to be` forgiving' in that occasional missed doses would not reduce efficacy and that fact gave positas further confidence in eliminating one dose every two weeks
j.a
4848-49 ; 4884-85 ; 4732
higher doses were clinically shown to be at least as effective as lower doses ; cohen shows at the very least that 40mg *1029 is as effective and well-tolerated as 20mg but with a more rapid onset of action
finally teva itself in its 1996 application to fda indicated that pharmacokinetic_studies` would be of limited value'
j.a
20689

in light of the foregoing we hold that the 40mg_ga_3x/week_regimen is obvious in light of the prior_art and find no clear_error in the conclusion that a posita would be motivated to combine the 40mg_ga_dose which had proven efficacy with a 3x/week frequency which was desirable because the prior_art indicated that less frequent administration increased patient_adherence while maintaining efficacy

b
improved tolerability and reduced frequency limitations
claims 14 16 and 17 of the250_patent and claim 7 of the413_patent require that the 40mg_ga_3x/week_regimen reduce the frequency of isrs and ipirs relative to the daily 20mg_ga_regimen
claim 15 of the250_patent on which claims 16_and_17 depend requires that the claimed regimen improve tolerability as compared to the daily 20mg_regimen

teva argues that the prior_art did not lead positas to expect improved tolerability and reduced_frequency of injection_reactions from the claimed regimen compared to 20mg_ga daily
we disagree and find no clear_error in the district_courts findings regarding khan 2008 caon and flechter all of which demonstrate that improved tolerability and less frequent injection_reactions were expected from the claimed less frequent regimen as compared to 20mg daily
see in re copaxone 2017_wl_401943 at *17-18
caon for example disclosed that the frequency of a severe injection-site reaction lipoatrophy was` significantly less' for the every-other-day patient group than for the daily_group
j.a
20386
pinchasi recognized that a 40mg_ga_dose resulted in increased efficacy` not accompanied by a corresponding_increase of adverse_reactions'
j.a
20944
the court also relied upon testimony from dr._green that reducing the frequency of injections was expected to reduce the number of injection-related reactions

teva finds fault with the district_courts reference to` common_sense' in its reliance on dr._greens testimony
during trial appellees expert dr._green testified that a posita would expect reducing the frequency of injections to be associated with enhanced overall tolerability of the regimen
j.a
4911
in its post-trial briefing teva argued that dr._greens testimony was conclusory and unsupported by the prior_art
the district_court rejected this characterization noting that` it is simply common_sense that if a patient experiences adverse_reactions from an injection reducing the number of injections they receive would reduce the number of times they have a reaction'
in re copaxone 2017_wl_401943 at *17
the district_court went on to identify additional evidence in the record to support dr._greens statement including evidence in the khan 2008/caon and flechter studies and testimony from dr. wolinksy tevas own expert who testified that he had prescribed copaxonethe_r 20mg for use every other_day off-label use for his patients who were` doing extremely well on the drug but [ were ] having trouble with injection_site problems'
id
we see no error in what is essentially a credibility determination where the district_court credited dr._greens expert testimony supported by other_evidence in the record that a reduction in the number of injections would result in less frequent reactions
see j.a
4857

teva also argues that the district_court erred by relying on tevas gala_protocol
*1030 the district_court did not use gala as invalidating prior_art but instead as evidence of a positas motivations and expectations when reading the prior_art at the time of the invention
in re copaxone 2017_wl_401943 at *20
with respect to the sufficiency limitations the district_court used gala only for that limited_purpose noting tevas statement to fda that` one may certainly expect a reduction in the frequency of such reactions with this new dose regimen further enhancing subject adherence to treatment'
id.at *18 emphasis added quoting j.a
8267
the district_courts reliance on gala merely as confirmation of how a posita would understand forte which is prior_art is not erroneous

c. reduced severity claims of the776_patent
the asserted_claims of the776_patent contain additional limitations requiring that the 40mg_ga_3x/week_regimen` reduce [ s ] severity of injection_site_reactions' compared to a 20mg_daily_regimen
see e.g.776_patent col. 17_ll._37 -54 ; col. 17_l._65 -col. 18_l._22
the parties stipulated that` severity' means` the intensity of a patients isrs and/or ipirs'
j.a
1994
`` severity' appears in the specification of the776_patent only once in connection with injection_site_reactions in the definition of` tolerability' which means` associated with the frequency and severity of post injection_reactions and injection_site_reactions'
'776_patent col._7,_ll._37-42 emphasis added
`` tolerability influences the period that a patient can follow ga treatment'
id

after reviewing the prior_art the district_court concluded that the776_patents claims directed to reducing the severity of injection_site_reactions would have been obvious
in re copaxone 2017_wl_401943 at *22
the district_court broadly relied on two different types of evidence in reaching this conclusion evidence and testimony relating to lipoatrophy and evidence relating to tolerability

concerning the evidence relating to lipoatrophy the district_court pointed to trial_testimony establishing that lipoatrophy the loss of subcutaneous fat at the injection_site is a severe_isr and caons disclosure that` [ i ] njection related lipoatrophy was significantly less' on the 20mg every other_day_regimen than on the daily 20mg_regimen
id
the court also relied on tevas expert dr._fox who testified that` if there is a decrease in the frequency of lipoatrophy there would by definition then also be a decrease in the severity of the adverse_events'
id
we agree with the district_court that this evidence` provides a reasonable_expectation to those skilled in the art that reducing the number of injections per week may also reduce the severity of injection_site_reactions'
id

in addition to the evidence regarding lipoatrophy the district_court also pointed to a press release issued by teva summarizing forte which admitted that the 40mg_dose` maintained the favorable safety and tolerability profile of copaxonethe_r 20mg' and testimony from the named inventor dr._klinger that` if a 40 mg three-times-a-week_regimen improves patient tolerability then it inherently has to reduce the frequency and severity of injection_site_reactions'
id.at *23
citing dr._klingers testimony the district_court correctly concluded that` it follows that the forte_study showed that administering 40mg of ga daily to patients did not increase the frequency or severity of injection_site_reactions'
id

teva contends that the district_court erroneously conflated frequency with severity and that evidence of reduced_frequency of isrs can not prove reduced_severity of isrs
while we agree that the *1031 two concepts are distinct we conclude that the district_court did not err
frequency and severity of isrs are not interchangeable but dr._foxs testimony established that in certain instances they are related q
doctor is severity the same thing as frequency ?
a
no theyre related but they are separate topics
q
how do they relate to one another ?
a
there as i mentioned before.. there are some events like lipoatrophy that would be considered to be more severe
so if there is a decrease in the frequency of lipoatrophy there would by definition then also be a decrease in the severity of the adverse_events
q
so do you consider these two concepts to be mutually exclusive ?
a
no they are not
they are related
j.a
5523

caon showed that reducing the frequency of injections from daily to every other_day resulted in` significantly less lipoatrophy' a severe_isr
this statement in caon can be read as indicating either that lipoatrophy occurred less frequently with less frequent_injections-which according to dr._foxs testimony` by definition' means reduced_severity-or the expression of the lipoatrophy itself was less severe
it was not unreasonable for the district_court to conclude from this evidence that a posita would think it obvious that the 40mg_ga_3x/week_regimen with its less frequent_injections would result in reduced_severity of at least one isr lipoatrophy particularly given dr._foxs testimony endorsing the same
see hoffmann-la_roche 748 f.3d at 1331 holding that prior_art references need only demonstrate` a reasonable_expectation of success' not` conclusive proof of efficacy'

teva also disputes the district_courts reliance on the forte press release
however given that the findings made by the district_court in reaching its obviousness_conclusion based on the other_evidence relied on by the court were not clearly erroneous we do not reach this argument

conclusion
in light of the foregoing we conclude that the district_court did not err in invalidating all asserted_claims of the copaxone_patents as obvious
