lourie circuit_judge
new_idea farm equipment corporation new_idea appeals from a judgment entered by the united_states_district_court for the northern_district of illinois no._84- c-10665 january 28 1987 holding sperry corporation and new_holland inc. collectively sperry not liable for infringement of u.s
patents 3,868,811811 and 4,018,036036 owned by new_idea
the case was tried to a jury which returned a special_verdict under rule 49 a fed.r.civ.p. on which a judgment of invalidity under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 a and 102 g was based

i
background
a
development of the inventions and the prior art
new_idea and sperry manufacture and sell harvesters windrowers and mower_conditioners for the farm industry.1 in the late 1960s and early 1970s international_harvester ih and hesston corporation hesston both farm equipment manufacturers were active in developing a tractor-drawn mower_conditioner that would operate` outboard' of the tractor to avoid the tractors running over the crop
in developing this harvester the companies also wanted to have a machine that would have flexibility of movement and efficient cutting patterns similar to self-propelled harvesters but less expensive

in 1968_and_1969 hesston performed a study to begin developing a tractor-drawn harvester which utilized a tongue arched over the header to pull the harvester
merle burkhart hesstons engineer who continued the study envisioned an arched tongue attached to the frame of the harvester in several locations including the center
it was not until the fall of 1972 that hesston under the direction of burkhart finally built and operated a harvester utilizing an arched tongue attached to the center of the harvester frame that embodied the inventions claimed in the patents in suit
during this development period on october 21 1971 burkhart filed an application for a patent on a pull-type hydraulically-powered forage harvester having a tongue arched over the header and pivoted on the rear frame adjacent to one side referred to by the parties as a` side-pivot' harvester
this machine is illustrated by figs
1_and_2 of u.s. patent 3,832,837837 reproduced below

*1563. ?
-- -- -

a prototype of this machine was being field tested by hesston near phoenix arizona on may_8,_1972
george cicci and guy tufts employees of ih saw and inspected the machine and its operation during the field test and conceived the idea of putting the arched tongue in the middle of the harvester so that the harvester could be operated fully outboard on both sides of the tractor
on that spring day in arizona cicci and tufts made a sketch of their invention
application for a patent on the invention was eventually filed on april_20,_1973 from which two patents issued the811 and036_patent_s2 these patents were later purchased from ih by a predecessor of new_idea

the cicci811_patent covers a harvester which utilizes an arched tongue i.e. an elongated beam attached on both ends pivotally to hitch the harvester to the tractor so that the harvester can be moved to operate on either side of the tractor
the036_patent covers a method of harvesting adjacent rows of standing crops by using the harvester
this harvester and its operation are illustrated in figs
1_and_2 of the811_patent reproduced below

*1564. ?
the811_patent contains seven claims ; claim 1 is the broadest 1
a crop harvester adapted to be pulled by a tractor having wheels on either side comprising a frame ; a pair of ground wheels supporting said frame ; harvesting apparatus forwardly mounted on said frame and adapted to receive and harvest crops ; an arched hitching tongue having one end pivotally mounted to said frame about an axis located proximate to the transverse center of said frame a distal end adapted for pivotal connection to a tractor hitch and an intermediate portion capable of passing over said harvesting *1565 apparatus said harvesting apparatus remaining in a forward orientation said tongue being of sufficient length to permit said harvester to be operated with said harvesting apparatus outboard of said tractor wheels on either side thereof and substantially perpendicular to the path of travel ; and
control means connecting said frame to said tongue to determine the relative angular position thereof to selectively permit placement of said harvester on either side of said tractor

the fundamental difference between the structure disclosed in the burkhart837_patent and that claimed in ciccis811_patent is the location of the pivot attachment to the frame of the harvester
as indicated above ciccis036_patent is directed to the method of operating the harvester fully outboard of either side of the tractor

district court proceedings
on december 13 1984 new_idea sued sperry alleging infringement of the811 and036_patent_s. sperry defended on grounds of patent invalidity under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 a and g3 at the close of this portion of the trial the jury deliberated and returned a verdict in the form of answers to six special_verdict interrogatories on anticipation

1
do you find that hesston was first to conceive the invention ?
answer yes
2
do you find that hesston reduced the invention to practice prior to april_20,_1973 ?
answer yes
3
do you find that hesstons arched tongue center-pivot_machine was known to anyone besides hesston_employees prior to april_20,_1973 ?
answer yes
4
do you find that hesstons arched tongue center-pivot_machine was used by anyone besides hesston_employees prior to april_20,_1973 ?
answer yes
5
do you find that hesston did not abandon the invention after it reduced the invention to practice ?
answer yes
6
do you find that international_harvester did not use reasonable diligence in filing its patent application with the united states patent office ?
answer no
based on the jurys answers the judge concluded that all of the claims of the811 and036_patent_s were invalid as anticipated under sections 102 a and 102 g and entered judgment accordingly
new_ideas post-trial motions for jnov and new_trial were denied

ii
discussion
the issue before us is whether the district_court erred in denying new_ideas motions for jnov and new_trial
when considering a motion for jnov a district_court must consider all the evidence drawing all reasonable inferences in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party without determining credibility or substituting its choice for that of the jury in deciding between conflicting evidence
the moving party is entitled to a jnov only when the district_court is convinced on the record before the jury that reasonable persons could not have reached a verdict for the nonmoving party

) cert
denied 469_u.s._871 105_s.ct._220 83_l.ed.2d_150_(1984)
as an alternative to jnov a court in its discretion may grant a motion for a new_trial if prejudicial error occurred or if the verdict is against the weight of the evidence
shatterproof_glass_corp. v. libbey-owens ford co. 758_f.2d_613 626 225_uspq_634 643 fed.cir.1985

to achieve reversal of the district_courts denial of the motion for jnov new_idea *1566 must convince this court that the jurys findings are not supported by substantial_evidence or that those findings can not support the legal_conclusions drawn by the jury or the judge
see senmed inc. v. richard-allan medical indus. 888_f.2d_815 817 12_uspq2d_1508 1510 fed.cir.1989
the district_courts denial of the motion for a new_trial will be reversed only if the trial_judge abused his discretion
shatterproof_glass_corp. 758 f.2d at 626 225 uspq at 643

a
section 102 g section 102 g provides that a person is entitled to a patent unless` before the applicants invention thereof the invention was made in this country by another who had not abandoned suppressed or concealed it'
new_idea argued in its motion for a directed verdict and in its motion for jnov that the prior invention of another can not be used to invalidate a patent in an infringement action

while more commonly applied to interferences section 102 g is indeed applicable to prior invention situations other than in the context of an interference
see e.i
du pont de nemours & co. v. phillips petroleum co. 849_f.2d_1430 7_uspq2d_1129_(fed.cir.) cert
denied 488_u.s._986 109_s.ct._542 102_l.ed.2d_572_(1988)
thus the dates of burkharts conception and reduction to practice are relevant in determining whether his inventive activity was prior to and therefore invalidates ciccis patent under section 102 g
the jury in special_verdict one found that hesston i.e. burkhart4 was first to conceive the invention claimed by cicci
new_idea challenges burkharts conception by arguing that special_verdict one is not supported by substantial_evidence and that the testimony of burkhart was not corroborated
the record shows that hesston performed a study in 1968_and_1969 concerning the arched tongue feature of the invention
burkhart testified that during the study hesston engineers began working on an arched tongue pull-type harvester designed with a center pivot
this testimony was supported by sketches of design concepts made during the study
burkhart also testified that in late 1970 he built a mock-up of an arched tongue_harvester with the tongue attached to the center of the harvester
a drawing by a hesston draftsman of an arched tongue assembly dated january 28 1971 also indicates that the tongue would be attached to the center of the harvester
burkharts testimony further showed that in early 1971 a prototype harvester was built with an arched tongue and a center pivot connection to the harvester
the various sketches and drawings made by people other than burkhart provide adequate corroboration of burkharts testimony
this activity was further corroborated by hesstons meeting minutes of july_14,_1971 concerning the side-pivot arched tongue_harvester
the minutes state` put the pivot in the center and cut back and forth'
substantial evidence thus supports the jurys conclusion that burkhart conceived a center pivot version of its prototype and knew of its advantages before cicci and tufts inspected the hesston side-pivot prototype in the spring of 1972 and conceived the patented center pivot invention

the jury found and new_idea concedes that hesston was first to reduce the center pivot invention to practice i.e. that hesston reduced the invention to practice before ciccis filing date.5 this reduction to practice occurred in august 1972 on the burkhart farm
the hesston prototype center-pivot_machine was then shipped to a farmer near turon kansas where it was publicly used on several farms

it is well established that in a priority contest the party first to conceive and first *1567 to reduce to practice prevails
see generally 3 d. chisum patents ¡± 10.03 [ 1 ] at 10-20 1990
since burkhart was first on both counts it necessarily follows that in the context of section 102 g` before the invention thereof [ by cicci ] the invention was made in this country by another [ burkhart ] who had not abandoned suppressed or concealed it
`` 6 therefore we affirm the district_courts judgment of invalidity under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 g7

b
other issues
two additional issues were raised that merit addressing
first new_idea contends that even if this court does not reverse the judgment below and grant its jnov the judgment should be vacated and a new_trial granted because the judge improperly instructed the jury over new_ideas objection on the issue of conception
specifically new_idea contends as it did at trial that the court failed to tell the jury that the inventors testimony on conception must be corroborated

a new_trial on the ground of erroneous instructions is permissible only when it is clear that an error in instructions as a whole was such as to have misled the jury
railroad_dynamics inc. v. a._stucki_co. 727_f.2d_1506 1518 220_uspq_929 939 fed.cir.1984
we review this denial of new_ideas motion for a new_trial under an abuse of discretion_standard
orthokinetics inc. v. safety travel chairs inc. 806_f.2d_1565 1581 1_uspq2d_1081 1092 fed.cir.1986
the portion of the courts instructions to the jury which relate to conception are as follows you are the sole judges of the credibility of the witnesses and of the weight to be given to the testimony of each of them..
in determining the credit to be given to the testimony of a witness you may take into account.. the reasonableness of his testimony considered in the light of all the evidence in the case..
the term conception or conceive refer to the mental part of making an invention the time at which the inventor first pictures the complete invention in his mind.. clear and convincing_evidence means evidence which produces in your mind a firm belief or conviction as to the matter sought to be established..
the first question is` do you find that hesston was the first to conceive the invention'
now let me translate that question..
translated what that means is do you find by clear and convincing_evidence that hesston was the first to conceive the invention
j._app
3540-3544

although these instructions do not explicitly require that the inventors testimony on conception must be corroborated they do instruct the jury to consider testimony or other pieces of evidence in light of all the evidence and to seek clear and convincing_evidence of conception
in view of these instructions as a whole and the evidence of record we do not believe that the jury was confused on the issue of corroboration

second the trial_judge in his november 1989 supplemental judgment order awarded sperry one-half its attorney_fees based on fed.r.civ.p
11_and_37 c because new_idea wrongfully refused to admit certain_facts during discovery
the judge further stated in that order should the court of appeals agree with the defendants that they were not required to prove that burkhart was the first to conceive the invention then of course 100 percent of the reasonable cost of proving the` hesston facts' should be awarded
*1568 new_idea_farm_equipment_corp. v. sperry_corp. no._84- c-10665 slip op.at 4 1989_wl_152288_(n.d.ill._november_6,_1989)

sperry now contends that it was not necessary to prove burkharts conception which new_idea should have admitted during discovery ; sperry therefore claims that it is entitled to the other_half of its attorney_fees
we disagree
an award of attorney_fees under rules 11_or_37 is subject to our review under an abuse of discretion_standard
see national hockey league v. metropolitan hockey club inc. 427_u.s._639 642 96_s.ct._2778 2780 49_l.ed.2d_747 751 1976
no such abuse was shown
moreover the outcome of the case could not have been nearly as clear at trial as hindsight might now indicate
finally proof of burkharts conception was relevant and necessary for sperry to prevail
we see no abuse of the trial_judges discretion in not awarding the other_half of the attorney_fees to sperry

we have considered all the other points raised by new_idea but find no reversible error

iii
conclusion
as indicated by its denial of new_ideas post-trial motions the district_court was not convinced by the record before the jury that a reasonable person could not have reached a verdict for sperry or that the jury was misled
we are equally unpersuaded
new_idea has not convinced us that the jurys findings are not supported by substantial_evidence that those findings can not support the legal_conclusions drawn by the jury or the judge or that the judge abused his discretion in denying new_ideas motion for a new_trial or for jnov
therefore the judgment is affirmed

affirmed

harvesters are farm machinery for cutting forage crops-green hay and grass-type crops used primarily as animal feed
a mower_conditioner is a particular type of harvester that cuts or mows a crop and conditions it in some way before laying it on the ground as a flat ribbon
a windrower is a mower_conditioner that gathers the cut crop into a row that is narrower than the swath the width of the cut made by the harvester
2
neither the jury nor the district_court made any distinction between these patents one of which claims the apparatus and the other the method
the briefs make no such distinction
we assume the parties have treated the patents similarly because the operative facts apply to both of them
in any event we will also not treat them separately

cicci can only rely on his filing date for reduction to practice as he does not allege an actual reduction to practice
6
as special_verdicts 2-5 are not in dispute the question of whether hesston burkhart abandoned suppressed or concealed the invention is not at issue
7
because we affirm the district_court judgment based on 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 g we need not address the issues relating to 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 a
moreover ciccis allegation of diligence is irrelevant because he was not the first to conceive the invention
