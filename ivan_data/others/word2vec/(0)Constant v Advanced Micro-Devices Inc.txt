davis circuit_judge
appellant_constant has raised a large number of separate and diverse issues on appeal
the appealed decisions and rulings of the united_states_district_court for the central_district of california are all affirmed

discussion
in january 1985 appellant james constant sued a large_group of high_technology_companies for infringements of his united_states patents nos._3950,635 the635_patent and 4,438,491 the491_patent
the complaint also contained nine counts involving other theories of recovery and included challenges to the constitutionality of 35 u.s.c.¡± 282 and of federal funding of research and development
the district_court hon
pamela a. rymer dismissed all counts except the infringement claim count v for failure to state claims upon which relief could be granted and later denied several motions by constant attempting to revive the dismissed claims

the defendants filed counterclaims for declaratory_relief asking to have the patents declared invalid unenforceable and not infringed
the case was transferred to the hon
steven v. wilson on december 16 1985
in august 1986 judge_wilson with the agreement of all parties appointed a special_master robert e. hillman to make recommendations to the court concerning motions for summary_judgment on issues of patent invalidity
after the special_master issued recommendations concluding that the patents are invalid constant moved to disqualify the special_master and to strike his report
the court ruled against these motions after hearings during which constant was given a special opportunity to question the master
the court independently determined that there were no material issues of contested facts and entered a summary_judgment declaring the claims of the two patents to be invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡±¡± 102 b and 103

constant now appeals the judgments of invalidity the dismissal of his constitutional claims the appropriateness of a summary_judgment the role and conduct of the special_master and several procedural rulings of the district_court
because of appellants earnest efforts to support his positions we deal with them in greater detail than their merits deserve

i
constitutional issues
appellant challenges the constitutionality of 35 u.s.c.¡± 282 which among other things permits the federal_courts to adjudicate the validity of patents when invalidity is raised as an affirmative_defense in infringement_suits [ 1 ]1
his argument is based on the wording of the patent and copyright_clause of the constitution u.s. const
art
i ¡± 8 cl
8 which states that *1564 congress shall have the power to` promote the progress of.. useful_arts by securing for limited_times to..
inventors the exclusive right to their..
discoveries'
appellant construes the word` securing' to require that a patent issued by the patent and trademark office pto must be` secure' i.e
conclusively valid and unchallengeable

this novel interpretation is obviously erroneous
since the adoption of the first patent act in 1790 congress has permitted judicial_review of the validity of patents.2 the courts the interpreters of the meaning of the constitution have consistently construed the patent and copyright_clause to permit judicial_review of patents
see graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 8-10 86_s.ct._684 689-90 15_l.ed.2d_545 148_uspq_459 462-64 1966 ; slawson v. grand street r.r
107_u.s._649 652 2_s.ct._663 666 27_l.ed._576_(1882) ; mast foos & co. v. stover mfg co. 177_u.s._485 488-89 20_s.ct._708 710 44_l.ed._856_(1900)
public policy requires that only inventions which fully meet the statutory standards are entitled to patents
this policy is furthered when the validity of a patent which was originally obtained in ex parte proceedings in the pto can be challenged in court
lear inc. v. adkins 395_u.s._653 670 89_s.ct._1902 1911 23_l.ed.2d_610 162_uspq_1 8 1969

`` within the limits of the constitutional grant the congress may.. implement the stated purpose of the framers by selecting the policy which in its judgment best effectuates the constitutional aim'
graham 383 u.s. at 6 86 s.ct.at 688 148 uspq at 462
accord united_states v. dubilier condenser corp. 289_u.s._178 189 53_s.ct._554 558 77_l.ed._1114 17_uspq_154 158 1933
thus congress has broad discretion on how to implement the conditions and tests for patentability
id
; mcclurg v. kingsland 42 u.s. 1 how
202 206 11_l.ed._102_(1843)
nowhere does the constitution require that the determination of patent_validity be vested solely in the pto or even that there be a pto
congress was fully within its constitutional power when it delegated power to the courts in 35 u.s.c.¡± 282 to adjudicate the validity of patents in infringement_suits.3 congress was also within its constitutional powers when it created a reexamination procedure as an additional mechanism for the review of patents
the creation of reexamination did not divest the courts of any power to review patent_validity
see 35 u.s.c.¡± 306 ; patlex corp. v. mossinghoff 758_f.2d_594 601-02 225_uspq_243 248-50 fed.cir.1985 ; in re etter 756_f.2d_852 857-58 225_uspq_1 3-4 fed.cir.1985
the district_court thus had jurisdiction to review the validity of the635 and491_patent s

appellant also argues that government_sponsorship of research and development is unconstitutional [ 5 ]
he objects particularly to government_sponsorship of the research reported in an article by allen and westerfield which was found to be prior_art against his patents
he advances two constitutional_arguments
first he argues that government_sponsorship of research and development offends the` science clause' 4 of the constitution *1565 which he construes to mean that the only constitutionally permissible means for the government to promote science is by securing the rights of inventors and authors
this interpretation is likewise erroneous
art
i ¡± 8 cl
8 does not state that the government may promote the progress of the useful_arts only through the patent and copyright system
ample constitutional power for government funding of research and development can be found in art
i ¡± 8 cl
1 provide for the common defense and general welfare cl
3 commerce cl
12 army cl
13 navy and cl
18 necessary and proper clause
it is also settled that art
i. ¡± 8 authorizes congress to spend money to promote the` general_welfare' and that the definition of the general_welfare and decisions concerning how to promote it are within the discretion of congress
helvering v. davis 301_u.s._619 640 57_s.ct._904 908 81_l.ed._1307_(1937) ; buckley v. valeo 424_u.s._1 90-91 1976
government support for research and development is well within this discretionary power

appellant charges that he has been deprived of liberty and property without due_process in violation of his 5th and 14th amendment rights in several contexts [ 5 7 10 11 ]
he fails to point to any legally recognized liberty interest of which he has been deprived
the court below has invalidated his patent property interest but the legal proceedings in which he participated fully provided the constitutionally required degree of due_process
there may be debate as to the full meaning of` due_process' and the courts have struggled to define its boundaries and requirements within the context of nonjudicial governmental action
e.g. mathews v. eldridge 424_u.s._319 96_s.ct._893 47_l.ed.2d_18_(1976)
however it is unambiguously clear that federal judicial proceedings with their extensive notice opportunity to be heard and procedural protections satisfy the constitutional requirement of procedural due_process required for the invalidation of a patent
constant has failed to demonstrate any legally cognizable deprivation of due_process
on the contrary the district_court went to great_lengths to give his claims a full and fair hearing

appellant tried to reargue these constitutional_arguments in his motions for declaratory judgment [ 11 ]
the district_court properly dismissed these motions for procedural defects
plaintiff should understand that had these motions been considered on the merits he would have lost for the reasons stated in this opinion

ii
dismissal of noninfringement claims
the district_court dismissed counts i-iv and vi-x for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to fed.r.civ.p
12 b 6 [ 10 ]
these counts alleged a variety of causes of action including deprivation of civil_rights constitutional rights and antitrust violations
the dismissals were correct on several grounds
a dismissal for failure to state a claim is proper where it appears beyond doubt that plaintiff can prove no set of facts which would entitle him to relief
conley v. gibson 355_u.s._41 45-46 78_s.ct._99 102 2_l.ed.2d_80_(1957) ; stanspec co. v. american chain & cable co. 531_f.2d_563 566 189_uspq_420 422 ccpa 1976
appellants objections appear to center mainly on his assertions that he can and is entitled to prove the facts asserted in the complaint
however the court found that those facts even if true would not entitle appellant to relief from the court
the court determined that each of his claims lacks some element that would be necessary to entitle him to legal relief
we have considered the reasoning for the dismissal of each count set forth in the tentative ruling appended to the courts order of july_2,_1985 and see no legal_error

there are also numerous additional legal grounds supporting dismissal
for example appellant cites *1566 united brotherhood of carpenters v. scott 463_u.s._825 103_s.ct._3352 77_l.ed.2d_1049_(1983) to argue that his count ii` civil rights/patent law' meets the criteria for a cause of action under 42 u.s.c.¡± 1985 3` conspiracy to interfere with civil_rights'
on the contrary the holding in that case is that conspiracies based on economic or commercial animus like those which appellant alleges are beyond the reach of ¡± 1985 3
id.at 839 103 s.ct.at 3361
the district_court correctly noted that appellant also failed to establish the requisite state action or class-based discriminatory animus

in addition to the defects requiring the dismissal of individual counts appellant has conceded that each of the nine dismissed counts depends inextricably on his theories concerning the unconstitutionality of 35 u.s.c.¡± 282 and of federal support for research and development
since these constitutional theories are without merit appellant could not prevail on any cause of action that depends upon them even if the facts stated in the complaint were true
thus dismissal of the nine counts under rule 12 b 6 was warranted

iii
the special_master
appellant argues that the use of a special_master deprived him of his right to a jury_trial [ 2 ]
he also challenges the qualifications of the special_master and charges that the latter` suppressed' and misinterpreted evidence [ 3 ]
constant contends that the district_court erred in refusing to grant his motions to disqualify the master and strike the masters recommendations

the federal_courts have the inherent_power to appoint persons unconnected with the court to aid judges in the performance of specific duties
ex parte peterson 253_u.s._300 312 40_s.ct._543 547 64_l.ed._919_(1920)
see ruiz v. estelle 679_f.2d_1115 1161_n._240_(5th_cir.1982)
although here the parties agreed to the appointment of a master the court has the power to appoint masters without the consent of the parties
peterson 253 u.s. at 312-14 40 s.ct.at 547-48
reference of issues to a master even compulsory reference does not violate the 7th amendment right to trial by a jury to which a masters findings may be read under rule 53 e 3
crateo inc. v. intermark inc. 536_f.2d_862 868 9th cir
) cert
denied 429_u.s._896 97_s.ct._259 50_l.ed.2d_180_(1976) ; peterson 253 u.s. at 309-12 40 s.ct.at 546-47
masters can properly aid the court in evaluating issues of patent_validity and infringement in the context of motions for summary_judgment and have often done so
milliken research corp. v. dan river inc. 739_f.2d_587 222_uspq_571_(fed.cir.1984) ; d.l
auld co. v. chroma graphics corp. 714_f.2d_1144 219_uspq_13_(fed.cir.1983)
see williams & thierstein use of masters in litigation 12 aipla q.j
227 237-43 1984

the powers and conduct of special_masters are generally governed by fed.r.civ.p
53 and the specific powers of the master are defined by the order of reference in each particular case
rule 53 c
judge_wilsons order of may_16,_1986 empowered the master to review the submissions of the parties hold hearings and make recommendations on the motions for summary_judgment as to the issues of invalidity and non-infringement that were before the court
all actions of the master were properly within the limits of that order of reference

appellant agreed to the appointment of the master and participated in hearings and presentation of evidence to the master
it was only after the master issued recommendations unfavorable to the appellant that the latter objected to the use of the master
a party can not wait to see whether he likes a masters findings before challenging the use of a master
failure to object in a timely fashion constitutes a waiver
spaulding v. univ
of wash. 740_f.2d_686 695 9th cir.1984 ; hill v. duriron co. 656_f.2d_1208 1213 6th cir.1981 ; hayes v. foodmaker inc. 634_f.2d_802_(5th_cir.1981)
there was no abuse of discretion in the district_courts denial of appellants motion to disqualify the master
macri v. united_states 353_f.2d_804_(9th_cir.1965)
the court also acted within its discretion in refusing to allow the appellant to attack the qualifications of the master during a special hearing that was held to *1567 allow the appellant to question the master on the merits of the recommendations

we also note that from the record mr. hillman appears to be very well qualified to serve as a master in this case
appellant_constant is wrong in presuming that a master need have the same expertise in the technology as the inventor
where complicated issues of patent law are involved the appointment of an experienced patent attorney is quite appropriate
the charges that the master misinterpreted and suppressed evidence are wholly unjustified

iv
summary judgment
appellant complains that the summary_judgment against him impermissibly shifted the burden of proof by requiring him to come forward during discovery with evidence of validity [ 8 ] thus depriving him of the procedural advantage that derives from the presumption of validity in 35 u.s.c.¡± 282
stratoflex inc. v. aeroquip_corp. 713_f.2d_1530 218_uspq_871_(fed.cir.1983)
on the contrary appellees met their burden of proceeding first and their burden of persuasion in connection with their motions for summary_judgment
appellees were entitled to use of discovery of the appellant in support of their motion for summary_judgment and this did not shift the burden of first-proceeding to constant

appellant failed to create a summary_judgment record that raised any genuine_issue of material_fact that would render summary_judgment inappropriate

v. validity of the491_patent
the purpose of the invention in the491_patent is to provide integrated circuit chips that can be interconnected in a computer with fewer wires leads
the wires that interconnect chips must be attached at bonding pads which are metallic areas on the chip that take up a relatively large amount of space that might otherwise be used for logic circuitry
the invention is based on eliminating some prior_art pads and leads and using the areas vacated to incorporate on-chip means for transmitting and receiving signals transceivers
for example the patent states that the receiver means can be implemented on the chip as an analog-to-digital a/d converter and that the transmitter means can be implemented on the chip as a digital-to-analog d/a converter
the interconnections between chips may then be reduced because a single analog voltage on a single wire can represent the same value that would require several wires to transmit in digital_form as binary os and 1s

the491_patent contains thirty claims
many of the claims differ from others only in using different kinds of transceivers instead of a/d converters e.g
modems light emitting diode/photodetector or in using different means instead of wires for interconnecting the chips e.g. optical acoustical electromagnetic
these transceiver and interconnecting means are all in the prior_art as are the monolithic i.e. on a single chip integrated circuits used in the invention
the claimed novel invention is the use of transmitter and receiver means on a chip in order to transform incoming and outgoing signals so as to reduce the number of pads on a chip and the number of interconnecting leads between chips

appellant sued appellee intel corporation intel charging that intels 2920 ic chip infringed the491_patentbig_token__5_the_2920__big_token is *1568 a single chip microcomputer in which an on-chip a/d converter converts an incoming analog signal into digital_form processes the digital data using programmable on-chip digital processors and then transforms it into an analog output signal through an on-chip d/a converter
( the 2920 also has additional capabilities such as sample-and-hold circuits for the input and output

appellant filed his application for the491_patent with the pto on october 14 1980
therefore the critical_date for purposes of a 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b statutory bar via prior description use or being on sale is october 14 1979
there is uncontroverted_evidence and constant has conceded that the 2920 was on sale before the critical_date
intel moved for a summary_judgment on the basis that these earlier sales anticipate and invalidate the asserted claims under ¡± 102 b

constant apparently conceded that the 2920 embodied the other elements of the claims in the patent but defended that the preamble of the claims was not anticipated by the 2920
the preamble of claims 1 18 and 23_through_28 is in jepson format and reads` in a computer with monolithic ic chips interconnected for data transfers the improvement to reduce the number of interconnections between chips including [ remaining claim elements ]'
constants argument was that sales of the 2920 before the critical_date did not anticipate the claimed invention since the chips were not sold interconnected with other chips in a computer

intel responded that the jepson format preamble should not be considered to be part of the claims and that sale of the 2920 chips alone was anticipatory
intel also submitted publications about the 2920 that had been distributed to the public before the critical_date-arguing that these publications anticipated all of the involved491 claims including the preamble
the district_court decided for purposes of the motion for summary_judgment to resolve all doubts in favor of constant and to assume that anticipation of the preamble was necessary and that the sale of 2920 chips alone did not anticipate the preamble
the court therefore examined the publications to determine whether they fully anticipated the claims in issue including the preamble
the court also considered in light of the materials submitted whether the claims in issue or any of the remaining claims in the patent would have been obvious under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103
the special_master was appointed to assist the court in reviewing submissions and to issue recommendations on these questions

the court held that certain publications submitted by intel fully anticipated all elements of claims 1 7 8 9 16 18 21 22_and_23 of the491_patent including the preamble and that those claims were therefore invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b
the court determined that all remaining claims of the491_patent which involved substitution of different transceiver or interconnection means would have been obvious to one having ordinary_skill in the art and were thus invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103

the court found that the claims 1 7 8 9 16 18 21 22_and_23 including their preambles were fully anticipated by exhibit 5 which is a specification sheet for the 2920 that was distributed to the public by intel in september 1979
appellant argues that exhibit 5 was not a printed publication for purposes of the ¡± 102 b bar [ 4 ] because there is no evidence in the record to prove that it was actually received by the public before october 14 1979
the statutory phrase` printed publication' has been interpreted to mean that before the critical_date the reference must have been sufficiently accessible to the public interested in the art ; dissemination and public accessibility are the keys to the legal determination whether a prior_art reference was` published'
in re hall 781_f.2d_897 899 228_uspq_453 455 fed.cir.1986 ; in re wyer 655_f.2d_221 226-27 210_uspq_790 794-95 ccpa 1981
intel presented extensive *1569 uncontroverted_evidence of business practice that was sufficient to prove that exhibit 5 was widely available and accessible to the interested public before october 14 1979
evidence of routine business practice can be sufficient to prove that a reference was made accessible before a critical_date
in re hall 781 f.2d at 899 228 uspq at 455
accessibility goes to the issue of whether interested members of the relevant public could obtain the information if they wanted to
if accessibility is proved there is no requirement to show that particular members of the public actually received the information

a printed publication must also be enabling
in re donohue 766_f.2d_531 533 226_uspq_619 621 fed.cir.1985
constant argues that exhibit 5 was not enabling [ 4 ] because it does not describe a computer_program to make the 2920 operational
he contends that in 1979_the_2920 was a novel sophisticated chip which required a new hardware and software package to program and argues that one having only ordinary_skill in the art would not be able to program and use the 2920
however intel has presented uncontroverted_evidence that the sp20 kit for programming the 2920 chip was available to the public and on sale before the critical_date
moreover specific_computer_programs are irrelevant to the claimed invention
the specification of the491_patent does not disclose any specific_computer_programs and does not suggest that a computer_program is part of the invention
such programs are not elements of the claims of the491_patent
the claims all concern hardware configurations
the disclosure in exhibit 5 is at least at the same level of technical detail as the disclosure in the491_patent
if disclosure of a computer_program is essential for an anticipating reference then the disclosure in the491_patent would fail to satisfy the enablement requirement of 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 first ?

constant also argues that exhibit 5 fails explicitly to disclose a reduction in the number of interconnections between chips as required by the preamble of the claims
the district_court found that reduction in the number of interconnections is inherent in the descriptions of applications for the 2920 described in exhibit 5
in sum there was no error in the district_courts conclusion that exhibit 5 was an enabling printed publication

the court concluded that all remaining claims of the491_patent would have been obvious to one having ordinary_skill in the art under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103
in analyzing obviousness the court considered the factors required by graham
see custom accessories inc. v. jeffrey-allan indus inc. 807_f.2d_955 958 1_uspq2d_1196 1197 fed.cir.1986
the court relied on the publications submitted by intel and also on constants own statements submitted to the pto during prosecution to the effect that all of the substitutions` can be made without undue experimentation by the routineer' with the help of prior_art references that he cited
constants main argument is that because the 2920 was so novel and sophisticated the level of skill needed to program it and to substitute transceiver and interface means was so high that it was beyond the ordinary_skill in the art
however constants own admission during prosecution that this could be accomplished by the routineer is strong_evidence to the contrary and is binding upon him
the district_courts findings were not erroneous and the conclusion that the remaining claims would have been obvious is not incorrect

vi
validity of the635_patent
the635_patent describes a digital signal processor for comparing two electrical signals either as a correlator where both signals are changing or as a matched_filter where one of the signals is a fixed reference signal stored in a memory device
correlators and matched_filters that used shift_registers to store the input and reference_signals were known in the prior_art
appellants invention uses random_access_memory ram devices instead of shift_registers to store the input and reference_signals
appellant conceded in the specification of the635_patent that everything described in the patent was prior_art *1570 technology except the use of rams with the required associated circuitry for addressing the memory instead of shift_registers
a statement in a patent that something is in the prior_art is binding on the applicant and patentee for determinations of anticipation and obviousness
in re nomiya 509_f.2d_566 571_n._5 [ sic ] 184_uspq_607 611_n._4_(ccpa_1975)

constant filed an application for the635_patent on june_17,_1974 and the patent issued on april_13,_1976
prior art publications submitted by the appellees included an article by allen and westerfield published in 1964 and u.s. patent no._3295,107 issued in 1966 the stalcup_patent
the court found that each of these references individually disclosed all of the elements in claims 1 2 6 8 9 and 11-14 of the635_patent and that the allen and westerfield_article also disclosed each and every element of claim 7
these claims were therefore held to be invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b

the court also examined whether any claims of the635_patent would have been obvious under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103
an article published by springer in september 1973 suggested using rams in place of shift_registers in a variety of applications
the springer_article falls short of disclosing the subject matter of claim 1 only in that while it recommends the general substitution of a ram for a shift register it does not specifically disclose a correlator or matched_filter
constant admitted that he read the springer_article and that it taught him to substitute rams for shift_registers and led him to conceive the inventions in the635_patent

the district_court examined the factual considerations required by graham 383 u.s. at 17-18 86 s.ct.at 694 148 uspq at 467 based on undisputed material_facts
the scope and content of the prior_art and the differences between the claims at issue and the prior_art were ascertained using the submitted documents
judge_wilson accepted constants own statement that the level of ordinary_skill in the art would be an individual having a ph.d. in electrical engineering or physics
the court concluded that there was no objective evidence of nonobviousness sufficient to create a genuine_issue of material_fact
sweats fashions inc. v. pannill knitting co. 833_f.2d_1560 1562-63 4_uspq2d_1793 1795-96 fed.cir.1987
the court then considered the claimed invention as a whole and found that all of the claims in the635_patent would have been obvious to one having that level of skill in the art-considering the springer_article the allen and westerfield_article and the stalcup_patent
the court ruled that obviousness had been established by clear and convincing evidence sufficient to overcome the presumption of validity attaching to a patent under 35 u.s.c.¡± 282

appellant raises a variety of objections concerning the invalidation of the635_patent [ 4 ]
his argument that the publications are not prior_art borders on the frivolous since the alan and westerfield_article and the stalcup were published about eight years before constant applied for his patent and constant has admitted that he read the springer_article before conceiving the invention
appellant also argues that the anticipating references lack various elements of his claimed invention
a claim is anticipated only if each and every element as set forth in the claim is found either expressly or inherently described in a single prior_art reference
kalman v. kimberly clark corp. 713_f.2d_760 771 218_uspq_781 789 fed.cir.1983 cert
denied 465_u.s._1026 104_s.ct._1284 79_l.ed.2d_687_(1984)
constant points to a number of features of his invention which he says are not found in the anticipating references
for example he argues that the random_access_memory in the claims was defined and must be understood to be a` semiconductor ram with log2n_address_lines connecting the ram through a decoder'
the allen and westerfield_article and stalcup_patent both use magnetic core memories instead of semiconductors
the court found that magnetic core memory is a type of ram
the limitations on which the appellant relies i.e. semiconductor log2n_address_lines connection through a decoder are not stated in the claims
other limitations that he *1571 tries to read from the specifications into the claims are also absent from the claims with the exception of the multiplier discussed below
it is the claims that define the claimed invention
uniroyal inc. v. rudkin-wiley corp. 837_f.2d_1044 1053 5_uspq2d_1434 1440 fed.cir.1988
and it is claims not specifications that are anticipated
although the embodiments in the specification involve semiconductor_rams and log2n_address_lines these limitations are not found anywhere in the claims
appellant is apparently invoking his rights as an inventor to be his own_lexicographer arguing that he defined random_access_memory in the specification in a way that requires these limitations to be read into the term
although a patentee may be his own_lexicographer the patent specification must support his asserted definition
fonar corp. v. johnson & johnson 821_f.2d_627 632 3_uspq2d_1109 1113 fed.cir.1987 cert
denied 484_u.s._1027 108_s.ct._751 98_l.ed.2d_764_(1988)
constant did not explicitly define terms anywhere in the specification in ways that support his current assertions
the text does not implicitly suggest that the words should be interpreted to convey the restricted interpretation that he now asserts
rather the patent states that the random_access_memory` may be any one of a number of types the exact type to be determined by the application'
col. 4 lines 15-17

appellant misinterprets the principle that claims are interpreted in the light of the specification
loctite corp. v. ultraseal ltd. 781_f.2d_861 867 228_uspq_90 93 fed.cir.1985
although the specification may aid the court in interpreting the meaning of disputed language in the claims particular embodiments and examples appearing in the specification will not generally be read into the claims

constants asserted limitations concerning semiconductor_rams and log2n_address_lines should not be read into the claims
his similar arguments concerning storing of words in a single location in memory connection of elements as disclosed in the figures and pulse compression also fail for similar reasons
although these elements are found as examples or embodiments in the specification they were not claimed explicitly
nor were the words that are used in the claims defined in the specification to require these limitations
a reading of the specification provides no evidence to indicate that these limitations must be imported into the claims to give meaning to disputed terms

all of the claims do specify` multiplier_means'
constant argues that this element is lacking in the references which disclose only exclusive-or gates
however an exclusive-or gate is a type of multiplier and the embodiment of the invention disclosed in the specification explicitly shows an exclusive-or gate used as a multiplier for comparison of signals in his invention
35 u.s.c.¡± 112 sixth ? provides that means-plus-function language in a claim shall be construed to cover the structure described in the specification and equivalents thereof
thus` multiplier_means' must be construed to cover the exclusive-or gates in allen and westerfield and the comparator in the stalcup_patent can reasonably be classified an equivalent thereof
there is no error in the district_courts decision that the specified claims were anticipated and are therefore invalid

in objecting to the finding of the obviousness of all claims appellant protests that the court did not consider the prior_art that was before the examiner in the patent office and complains that the anticipating references have not been shown to be more pertinent than the prior_art that was considered by the examiner
there is no legal authority for the view that the court must first determine that prior_art in an evaluation of obviousness is more pertinent than the prior_art considered *1572 by the pto.6 it is of course self-evident that any reference that fully anticipates claims of the patent or that was the source of ideas used by the inventor when he conceived his invention is relevant and can be considered on the issue of obviousness
if an invention would have been obvious in the light of certain prior_art references it is irrelevant that it would not have been obvious from other references

appellant protests that the court failed to consider objective indicia of nonobviousness as required by graham which must always be considered when available
stratoflex inc. v. aeroquip_corp. 713 f.2d at 1538 218 uspq at 879
however most of his purported evidence consisted only of argument and conclusory statements rather than factual evidence
thus he has failed to meet his burden to produce specific facts showing that on this issue there is a genuine_issue of material_fact for trial

obviousness is a question of law based on factual inquiries

this court can thus review a determination of obviousness for legal_error
even if we were to give the appellant the benefit of the doubt concerning his asserted objective indicia of non-obviousness in the context of this motion for summary_judgment we would find no error
appellees have established a strong prima facie case of obviousness that would not be overcome by the particular objective considerations advanced by the appellant
thus constants purported objective evidence of nonobviousness does not pose a genuine_issue of material_fact that would preclude summary_judgment

other issues
appellant has raised other issues on appeal concerning rulings of the district_court on evidentiary matters [ 7 ] discovery and joinder [ 9 ]
we have examined the rulings of the district_court on these matters and find no legal_error
in addition if there had been any legal_errors in these rulings they would have been harmless error that would not justify reversal

appellant has had an extensive opportunity to litigate his claims

two federal_courts have now fully and fairly considered appellants claims and determined that the491 and635_patent s are invalid and that his various other claims are without merit
in the past the appellant has repeatedly attempted to reassert or revive claims and theories after they have been properly dismissed with prejudice by the district_court
appellant is hereby cautioned that if he persists by trying to raise again the same issues that have been finally decided by the district_court or by this court he could be sanctioned under fed.r.civ.p

constant wrote intel stating that the 2920 signal processor infringed claims 1 7 8 9 16 18_and_23 of the491_patent and demanding that intel take a license
it is these claims plus claims 21_and_22 that were later found to be invalid because of anticipation by the allegedly infringing 2920 chip and its related publications

this notion appears to have been borrowed from the case law on the duty of candor before the pto where a patentee is obligated to call to the attention of the pto references more pertinent than those already known to the examiner
any relevant evidence whether more or less pertinent can be considered in an analysis of obviousness
