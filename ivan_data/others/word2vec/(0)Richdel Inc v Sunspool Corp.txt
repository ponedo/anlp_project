synopsis
plaintiff appealed from a judgment of the united_states_district_court for the northern_district of california holding a patent claim by plaintiff invalid and unenforceable
the court of appeals rich circuit_judge held that 1 it was error for the trial_court to have shifted the burden of proof and so require plaintiff to prove facts necessary to a conclusion of nonobviousness and 2 the evidence was sufficient to sustain the finding that claim one of patent no._4191,166 relating to a solar_water_heater_system was obvious to one of ordinary_skill in the art at the time the invention was made and thus the claim was invalid

opinion
rich circuit_judge
this appeal is from the october 22 1982 judgment of the united_states_district_court for the northern_district of california holding claim 1 of u.s._patent_no._4191,166 the166_patent owned by appellant richdel inc. richdel invalid and unenforceable and dismissing the suit
we affirm

jurisdiction in this court is under 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1 the above judgment being a` final decision'

background
the166_patent entitled` solar heat system' was granted march_4,_1980 to saarem et al
on an application filed december 27 1977
figure 1 thereof is reproduced below

*1575. ?
the figure is a schematic representation of one embodiment of the claimed invention
shown in the drawing are solar collector 10 valve_module 20 pump module 12 storage_tank 16 and control_module 32
solid lines represent fluid flow pathways and evenly broken lines show electrical connections
the dot-and-dash lines encompass the module elements
also shown in the drawing are temperature sensors 34_and_36 disposed to sense the temperatures of the water in the collector and storage_tank respectively

the sensors control_module and valve_module cooperate to perform several functions most notably to shut the system down and drain the collector when it is so cold outside that the water would otherwise freeze in and damage the collector
the sensors detect the dangerously cold condition and the control_module responds causing valve 28 to close and valves 22_and_26 to open thereby draining the collector
this feature is sometimes referred to as automatic_drain-down
the other functions performed are prevention of excessively hot water and shut down when the sensors indicate that no solar heat is available

claim 1 the only claim on appeal in numbered paragraphed form stipulated to by the parties reads as follows in a solar_water_heater_system which includes a collector a storage_tank a circulating pump and pipeline means intercoupling the collector storage and circulating pump to enable the pump to circulate a fluid through the collector to be heated therein and returned to the storage_tank said pipeline means including a supply_line extending from the pump to the collector and a return_line extending from the collector to the storage_tank ; the combination of *1576 1 a drain_line 2 an electrically energized valve_module coupling the pipeline means to the drain_line and
( 3 a control_module connected to the valve_module for selectively establishing the valve_module in an energized_operating_condition in which a circulating path for the fluid is established from the pump through the collector to the storage_tank and for selectively establishing the valve_module in a de-energized_operating_condition in which the fluid in the collector is discharged through the drain_lines ; said valve_module including a electrically activated means for selectively establishing the valve_module in its energized_operating_condition in response to an electric signal from the control_module and
( b spring_means for establishing the valve_module in its de-energized_operating_condition in the absence of such electrical signal and said valve_module further including
( c a first_valve interposed in the supply_line said first_valve being set to an open operating position by said electrically activated means when said valve_module is in its energized_operating_condition and said first_valve being set to a closed operating position by said spring_means when said valve_module is in its de-energizing operating condition and
( d said valve_module including a pair of valves respectively coupling the supply_line and the return_line to the drain valve said pair of valves being set to a closed position by said electrically activated means when said valve_module is in its energized_operating_condition and said pair of valves being set to an open position by said spring_means when said valve_module is in its de-energized_operating_condition

figure 6 of the166_patent shows the type of valve disclosed
while the valve_module figures prominently in the claim the claim appears to be directed to a sub-combination in a solar heater system not to the valve_module per se
realistically read the claimed combination includes practically all the elements of the entire system

?
the figure on the left shows the valve which richdel describes as a multi-port disc_valve in an open or normal operating position in which the disc 68 is held in turned position by a stalled motor
in this position port_v_communicates with central port d. to drain the system the motor is de-energized and a biasing spring turns disc 68 to the position shown in the right hand figure
in this position port_v_communicates with port p and ports c1 and c2 with port d. ports c1 and c2 correspond to valves 22_and_26 in fig._1
valve 28 in fig._1 is a diaphragm valve with an actuating chamber containing port v. this means that valve 28 is open or closed according to whether port v is open or closed
a valve such as valve 28 which is controlled by the flow of fluid through a smaller associated valve is called a pilot-operated valve and the smaller valve is called the pilot_valve

*1577 the prior_art relied upon by the district_court includes u.s._patent_no._4119,087 to cook
the cook_system is shown in fig._1 of his patent reproduced below

?
the cook_system has a solar energy collector 10 solenoid_valves 20 24 25 and 26 a solar circulator or pump 17 storage_tank 1 control_box 27 and sensor 19
the figure does not show that the control_box 27 sensor 19 and the solenoid_valves are electrically interconnected to effect freeze protection

the other prior_art is a system manufactured by sunsav inc. a valve_package manufactured by heliotrope_general and u.s._patent_no._4061,132 to ashton et al
the sunsav system is similar to the cook_system except that it uses a pair of three-way solenoid_valves rather than three separate valves
the heliotrope_general valve_package comprises a pair of solenoid_valves
it was designed to be used with an existing solar_water_heating_system and when used with a separately available control system implemented automatic_drain-down in that system
the ashton patent discloses a solar swimming pool heater which drains automatically *1578 when the sunlight is not heating the water

the type of valve used in all of these prior_art_systems is a pilot-operated solenoid valve
in such a valve the flow through the pilot_valve is controlled by a rod inserted into the hollow center of a cylindrical coil
the rod moves according to the presence or absence of a solenoidal magnetic field created by the flow of electrical_current through the coil
in this fashion fluid flow can be controlled by controlling the electrical_current
the record indicates that these valves proved unsatisfactory for drain-down applications for several reasons they are noisy ; they consume large amounts of power ; and as pilot-operated valves they depend on flow through small orifices which easily become clogged with particulate contaminants commonly found in water supplies

none of the prior_art relied on by the district_court was cited by the patent and trademark office pto during the course of prosecution of the166_patent

richdel alleged contributory infringement under 35 u.s.c.¡± 271 c by defendant sunspool based upon its manufacture use and sale of` drain valves embodying the invention of' the166_patent
sunspool manufactures a multi-port spool valve which it bills as` the reliable drain-down valve for solar collector freeze protection'
this spool valve has a thermosensitive actuator which contracts or expands along its length according to its temperature
the actuator is disposed in close proximity to an electrically resistive element
the amount of current through the element controls its temperature and thereby controls the length of the actuator
sunspools valve is described in its literature as a` direct acting spool mechanism for positive flow control' and is therefore not a pilot-operated valve
richdels vice president of engineering one of the166_patent ees testified that richdel redesigned the commercial_embodiment of its solar_water_heating_system to include spool valves instead of the disc-type valve described in the166 specification after complaints about performance of the latter

trial court findings and conclusions
after hearing the case without a jury the court apparently adopted sunspools 41 proposed findings of fact and 14 proposed conclusions of law in their entirety
among the salient findings of fact were findings that the commercial_embodiment of the system described in the166_patent had enjoyed a certain amount of commercial_success but that there had been no showing that` the patented_improvement had contributed to the commercial_success' and that prior_art_systems had had problems but that it had not been shown that the subject_matter claimed in the166_patent had solved those problems

the factual_determinations duly included those ordained in graham v. john_deere 383_u.s._1 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966) when deciding the obviousness issue under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 on the scope and content of the prior_art the differences between the claimed invention and the prior_art and the level of skill in the art
as to the differences the court found that the term` module' refers to an assembly of components connected together to form a functional package that` module' is so used in the166_patent in referring to the control_module and that the166 specification does not limit the` valve_module' recited as part of the claimed combination to the single integrated valve operated by a single electrically energized actuating element shown in fig._6 supra
the court therefore concluded that` at best the only difference between the prior_art and the claimed subject_matter is that the patentees have combined into one integrated unit that which was previously constructed from separate elements and then packaged in an integrated form'

the court adopted conclusions of law including the following richdel has not shown that any of the four prior_art references has been considered by the pto wherefore richdel the patentee had the burden of proving nonobviousness
`` the *1579 ultimate question however is one of law are the differences [ between the claimed invention and the prior_art ] of such magnitude that they would not have been evident at the time of invention to one possessed of ordinary_skill in the art'
the166_patent is a so-called` combination patent' that is a patent which claims a new combination of known elements wherefore a` searching and thorough inquiry' is called for because` patentable_invention is less likely to be found in a combination of old_elements'
the claimed invention would have been obvious ;` while there may be innovation in the claimed combination innovation is not invention'
this conclusion is buttressed by the absence of any unusual or surprising results and by the fact that key elements of the invention had been contemporaneously and independently developed by others
the proffered evidence of commercial_success is not persuasive because first` where a patent is obvious it can not be saved from invalidity by resorting to secondary_factors' and second because there has been no showing that the patented_improvement contributed to the commercial_success

the court accordingly concluded correctly even if for wrongly articulated reasons that claim 1 of the166_patent is invalid and unenforceable and also disposed of the infringement issue by saying` an invalid patent can not be infringed'

appellants contentions
richdel attacks the district_courts decision by emphasizing claim 1s recitation of a` valve_module' as part of the claimed combination
richdel contends that this term does not read on a package of separate_solenoid_valves such as those disclosed in the prior_art
a valve_module according to richdel is a single_valve_unit comprising separate_valve_components driven by a single actuator
richdel contends that its valve_module overcame problems with separate_solenoid_valves which made them unsuitable for drain-down applications and argues that the evidence establishes that the disc_valve disclosed in the166_patent used but a fraction of the power of solenoid_valves
it says the district_court should have taken judicial notice of the fact that the disc_valve avoided problems of clogging and excessive noise
richdel maintains that it does not matter that the prior_art relied on by the trial_court was not before the examiner because the examiner nevertheless had the best art before him cited it and still allowed the application

opinion
although we agree with the district_courts decision we note several errors of law in the analysis contained in the sunspool-proposed conclusions of law which it adopted

it was error for the trial_court to have implicitly required richdel to prove that the prior_art herein had been considered by the pto ; rather the burden was on sunspool to show that that prior_art had not been considered
see solder removal co. v. itc 65_c.c.p.a._120 582_f.2d_628 633_n._9 199_uspq_129 133_n._9_(1978)

it was error for the trial_court to have shifted the burden of proof and so require richdel to prove facts necessary to a conclusion of nonobviousness
35 u.s.c.¡± 282 permanently places the burden of proving facts necessary to a conclusion of invalidity on the party asserting such invalidity
stratoflex inc. v. aeroquip corp. 713_f.2d_1530_(fed.cir.1983) ; solder removal supra 582 f.2d at 633 199 uspq at 133

it was error for the district_court to assert that the differences between the claimed invention and the prior_art had to be nonobvious ; it is the claimed subject_matter as a whole which ¡± 103 says must be nonobvious not the differences

it was error for the district_court to derogate the likelihood of finding patentable_invention in a combination of old_elements
no species of invention is more suspect as a matter of law than any other
attempted categorization for the purpose of determining varying` rules' detracts from what should be the sole question whether the claimed invention would have *1580 been obvious within the meaning of ¡± 103
most if not all inventions are combinations and mostly of old_elements
stratoflex supra 713 f.2d at p. 1540

it was also error for the district_court to assert that` innovation is not invention'
the terms are at least since the 1952 patent act legally synonymous
innovation is always invention ; it may not be patentable_invention
`` invention' since the advent of ¡± 103 is no longer the prerequisite to patentability which it was prior to 1952
graham v. john_deere

the district_court erred in saying` where a patent [ emphasis ours ] is obvious it can not be saved from invalidity by resorting tosecondary_factors'
patents can not be obvious only inventions
much confusion has resulted from confusing patents government grants with the inventions disclosed therein
the issue is the obviousness of the claimed invention and that issue can be resolved only after all relevant evidence of nonobviousness including so-called` secondary considerations' if any has been taken into account
stratoflex at p. 1538 ; in re sernaker 702_f.2d_989 217_uspq_1_(fed.cir.1983)

notwithstanding these errors supplied to the court by counsel for the winning party we hold based on factual_determinations made by the district_court which were not clearly erroneous that it nevertheless reached the proper conclusion of obviousness
the noted errors were not prejudicial to the plaintiff
28 u.s.c.¡± 2111
*

we hold that the trial_court was correct in asserting that the system disclosed in the cook patent disclosed every feature of the system claimed in the166_patent with the exception of the` valve_module'
we do not read this term as richdel urges that is as a` single_valve_unit comprising separate_valve_components driven by a single valve actuator'
nothing in the166_patent warrants such a reading nor did any evidence adduced at trial
indeed there is testimony which amply supports the factual conclusion of the trial_court that` valve_module' is synonymous with a package of valves
thus claim 1 is broad enough to read on a solar heating system such as disclosed in cook which includes a valve_package such as that offered by heliotrope_general
such a system would have been obvious to one of ordinary_skill so that claim 1 reads on obvious subject_matter and is therefore invalid

in reaching our conclusion we have also considered the evidence offered in support of the assertion that richdels system was a commercial_success and solved problems which plagued prior_art_systems
we agree with the trial_court however that richdel failed to show that such commercial_success as its marketed system enjoyed was due to anything disclosed in the patent in suit which was not readily available in the prior_art
richdel has not even shown that the marketed system corresponds to the system disclosed in its patent as embodying the claimed invention

for the foregoing reasons we agree that claim 1 of the166_patent in suit would have been obvious to one of ordinary_skill in the art at the time the invention was made
the claim being invalid there is nothing to be infringed
similarly the holding of` unenforceability' is justified only for the reason that claim 1 is invalid no other ground-such as patent misuse-having been asserted

the judgment of the district_court is affirmed
