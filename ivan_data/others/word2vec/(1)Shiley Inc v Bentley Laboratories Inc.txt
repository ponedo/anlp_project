in action for infringement of patents relating to high_efficiency_heat_exchanger designed for use with blood_oxygenator the united_states_district_court for the central_district of california 601_f.supp._964 a wallace tashima j. entered injunction permanently enjoining manufacturer from further infringing patent claims
on subsequent motion for stay of injunction pending appeal on the merits the united_states_district_court for the central_district of california denied the motion
the court of appeals 782_f.2d_992 dismissed an appeal
on appeal on the merits court of appeals baldwin circuit_judge held that 1 the evidence supported jurys findings that patent_owner had made no misrepresentations or omissions in dealing with patent and trademark_office ; 2 record supported finding of willful_infringement and award of double_damages and attorney_fees ; 3 manufacturer was not entitled to new_trial ; and 4 jurys finding that no misrepresentation or omission was made in dealings with patent and trademark_office by patent_owner attorney or agent was supported by substantial_evidence so that questions on materiality and intent did not arise

opinion
baldwin circuit_judge shiley inc. shiley sued bentley_laboratories inc. bentley for infringement of u.s. patent nos._4065,264264 and 4,138,288288
bentley counterclaimed for a declaration of invalidity unenforceability and non-infringement
the action was tried to a jury and resulted in a verdict for plaintiff on all issues
the special verdict included jury_findings that none of the claims in suit was invalid that plaintiff was entitled to recover its lost profits in the amount of $ 17,528,000 that a reasonable royalty is twelve percent 12 % of the selling price of the accused device that plaintiff did not commit inequitable_conduct before the united states patent and trademark_office pto and that defendants infringement was willful
the court denied defendants motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict jnov treated the jury_finding of willful_infringement as merely advisory made an independent finding of willful_infringement and awarded double_damages attorney_fees prejudgment_interest and a permanent injunction
a final amended judgment in the amount of $ 44,248,137 was entered against bentley on march_13,_1985
shiley inc. v. bentley_laboratories inc. 601_f.supp._964 225_uspq_1013_(c.d.cal.1985)

bentley appeals from the trial_courts entry of judgment on the jury_verdict and charges the district_court with abuse of discretion in calculating the damage_award based on the issuance date of the264_patent in doubling the damage_award based on the finding of willful_infringement and in denying bentleys motion for new_trial based on prejudicial_error
we affirm

background
the patents in suit relate to a high_efficiency_heat_exchanger designed for use with a blood_oxygenator the` lung' portion of the heart-lung machine employed during open_heart_surgery
the heat_exchanger is used to lower the temperature of the blood prior to and during surgery and then to rewarm the blood to normal temperature
the cooled blood induces a condition called hypothermia characterized by slowed functioning of the vital organs and overall reduced oxygen consumption by the patient
hypothermia gives the surgeon time to perform a surgical procedure and enhances the patients likelihood of survival

the heat_exchanger of this invention can be formed from tubing which has a hollow helical spiral rib along its length
the tubing is wrapped around a cylinder and then encased in a tight-fitting shell
heated or cooled water flows through the inside of the tubing while the blood flows along the outside

*1565. ?
*1566 the combination of the rib and the surfaces of the cylinder and shell confines blood flow to a number of small long paths
temperature control is very efficient due in part to the large heat exchange surface contacted by a relatively small volume of blood

the helically ribbed tubing known by the trade name turbotec is made of metal
the shiley patent specifications referred to u.s. patent nos
re24 783_and_3015,355 for methods and apparatus for manufacture of such tubing
both aluminum and stainless steel are mentioned in the shiley_patents as possible materials for construction of the tubing
stainless steel is compatible with a blood environment but is expensive and has poor heat conductivity
aluminum is toxic to human blood but has good heat conductivity and is relatively inexpensive
the shiley_patents disclosed that the toxic properties of aluminum may be overcome by application of a thin coating of polyurethane

an alternative form of the tubing may have a series of individual ring-like ribs
the claims that refer to this type of tubing are 7 8 19_and_24 of the288_patent and are referred to as the bellows_claims
the district_court held that these claims were not in suit because no evidence was presented that defendant was making an oxygenator according to these claims

the heat_exchanger may be mounted within a blood chamber separate from the blood_oxygenator or incorporated within the oxygenator
the preferred embodiment of both shiley_patents the shiley product s-100 and bentleys accused device bos-10 all have the heat_exchanger located within the mixing chamber of a bubble_blood_oxygenator
a bubble_blood_oxygenator uses a device such as a sparge tube to introduce fine bubbles of oxygen and other gases into the blood
what actually travels through the heat_exchanger is blood foam not ordinary blood and a subsequent defoaming step is required
during prosecution of the shiley_patents the applicant demonstrated to the satisfaction of the examiner that the placement of this particular heat_exchanger within the mixing tank of a bubble oxygenator results in enhanced blood-gas transfer

issues
the issues before this court are whether the district_court erred in denying defendants motion for jnov and denying defendants motion for new_trial as well as issues relating to damages

judgment non obstante veredicto jnov inequitable_conduct
bentley argues that it is entitled to jnov because the jury_finding that shiley made no misrepresentation or omission in dealing with the pto is clearly erroneous not supported by substantial_evidence and contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence
this argument is based on the ground of nondisclosure to the pto of 1 advertisements for the turbotec_tubing used in the shiley patent and 2 a drawing of a bubble_blood_oxygenator with a heat_exchanger in the form of a helical_coil as employed by dr._frank_gollan a pioneer in the field of cardiac surgery

bentley argues that because the turbotec_ads contained a drawing of tubing that formed a helical_coil the jury_finding of no omission was erroneous as a matter of law
the jury was presented evidence from the file wrapper that the patents for the turbotec_tubing were considered by the examiner and that the pto viewed the turbotec patents as disclosing a heat_exchanger design identical to that claimed but that the applicant had made a sound case for patentability based on unexpectedly efficient gas interchange resulting from the specific design of the device
we conclude that a reasonable_jury could have found that no omission or misrepresentation occurred with respect to the turbotec_ads and that the district_court did not err in denying jnov on this ground

*1567 bentleys argument with respect to the drawing is similarly without merit
the drawing was published by dr._frank_gollan in his book physiology of cardiac surgery 1959
it is a schematic drawing applicable to several oxygenators designed and tested by dr._gollan which employed a heat_exchanger in the form of a helical_coil to simultaneously oxygenate and regulate the temperature of the blood
bentley claims this information was never presented to the pto
dr._gollan is well recognized in the field of blood hypothermia
his work has been described in other publications presented to the jury by bentley dr. pierre m. gallettis book heart-lung_bypass 1962 ; and dewall et_al.` theme and variations on blood oxygenators' surgery december 1961

research on the use of hypothermia for surgical procedures has been conducted since the 1950s
a number of different_types of heat_exchangers have been reported and applicant in both patent applications cited` heart-lung_bypass' by pierre m. galletti m.d
et_al. pp
165-170 1962 for a comparison of different_types of heat_exchangers
the following text appears on page 167 use has been made of this [ heat transfer by conduction ] with different geometrical configurations coils cylinders or plates
each of these three types feature advantages and drawbacks

( 1960_b._1961 astutely thought of a long stainless steel spiral wound in the helix settling chamber of the dewall-lilleher bubble oxygenator fig._59 c
* * *
[ emphasis added ]
the citation to figure` 21
a' refers to page 70 of that same text and to a drawing of the gollan_oxygenator
applicant did not cite directly to page 70 of` heart-lung_bypass' an omission that is the substantive basis for bentleys contention that shiley engaged in inequitable_conduct before the pto

the jury was presented considerable evidence on the issue of whether an omission had been made
it heard evidence that the gollan_oxygenators were used in pioneer work on open_heart_surgery in animals
it heard further evidence that the pto had reviewed more current prior_art including patent no._3437,450 to greenwood which bentley admitted on appeal does disclose simultaneous temperature control and oxygenation of the blood
the jury watched a film of a gollan_oxygenator in operation showing how it operates differently from the invention claimed in the patent in suit and that it has areas of stagnation a potentially deadly flaw

the jury was presented voluminous evidence during trial before reaching its conclusion that no omission had been made
substantial evidence supports the jury_findings
bentleys argument which selectively presents what favorable evidence may exist does not warrant reversal of that fact finding

willfulness
bentley argues that the district_court should have granted bentleys jnov_motion on willful_infringement because the undisputed facts establish that bentley did not willfully infringe as a matter of law
in this case the jury found willful_infringement and the judge independently found willful_infringement
see shiley inc. v. bentley_laboratories inc. 601_f.supp._964 968 225_uspq_1013 1016 c.d.cal.1985
the findings are in agreement and *1568 are amply supported by the record
the trial_court exercised its discretion to award double_damages based on its finding of willful_infringement
we find no abuse of discretion in this award see kori corp. v. wilco marsh buggies and draglines inc. 761_f.2d_649 656-57 225_uspq_985 989-90 fed.cir
) cert
denied 474_u.s._902 106_s.ct._230 88_l.ed.2d_229_(1985) or in the award of attorney_fees on this basis see rosemount inc. v. beckman instruments inc. 727_f.2d_1540 1547-48 221_uspq_1 8-9 fed.cir.1984

the trial_court apparently deemed it necessary to label as` advisory' one of the jurys fact_findings on willful_infringement and to make its own finding of fact to enable it to exercise the courts statutory discretion to award increased damages
35 u.s.c.¡± 284
* that step was neither appropriate nor necessary
all fact_findings of a jury are non-advisory unless made in an area expressly removed from jury_verdict
the first sentence of ¡± 284 deals with actual damages which if not found by the jury must be found by the court
the second sentence deals with increasing damages which is assigned to the court whether the facts of willful_infringement justifying an increase are found by a jury or by a court in a non-jury trial
thus if a jury_finding of willful_infringement is not overturned on a motion for jnov the court has discretion to award increased damages on the basis of the jurys finding ; if the jury_finding is that willful_infringement did not occur and that finding is not overturned on a motion for jnov no basis for assessing increased damages for willful_infringement exists ; if the jury_finding is that willful_infringement did not occur and the court does overturn that finding on a motion for jnov because no reasonable_jury could on all the facts find an absence of willful_infringement the court may increase damages within its discretion under ¡± 284

bentley argues that since it began to market its infringing device a month before any of shileys patents issued its infringement can not be willful as a matter of law under state industries inc. v. a.o
smith corp. 751_f.2d_1226 224_uspq_418_(fed.cir.1985)
we disagree
state does not as bentley contends hold that a finding of willful_infringement can not stand whenever manufacture of an accused device begins prior to the issuance of a patent
on the contrary state is in harmony with our prior and subsequent case law which looks to the` totality of the circumstances presented in the case' central soya co. v. george a. hormel & co. 723_f.2d_1573 220_uspq_490_(fed.cir.1983)

obviousness/manner of making invention
bentley argues that the district_court should have granted bentleys jnov_motion because the inventions of the shiley_patents would have been obvious as a matter of law
it argues that john lewin the inventor was a mechanical engineer who had no work experience with blood or blood_oxygenators and that he necessarily had less than ordinary skill in the art ; that he saw a turbotec_tubing ad and immediately conceived the successful design to obtain a known result
extensive evidence on these and related factual issues pertinent to obviousness was presented to the jury who were correctly instructed that patentability of an invention does not depend on how the invention was made
35 u.s.c.¡± 103
we see no reversible error in the district_courts refusal to grant jnov on the basis of bentleys argument

motion for new trial
denial of declaratory judgment counterclaim
bentley argues on appeal that its motion for new_trial should have been granted *1569 because the district_court refused to try its declaratory_judgment_counterclaim with respect to claims 6 7 19 and 24 bellows_claims of the288_patent
bentley asserts 1 it presented evidence to the trial_court that a bellows_oxygenator was being made by bentley at that time ; 2 it was prepared to prove that shiley had engaged in inequitable_conduct in its dealings with the pto by concealing an on-sale_bar with respect to these claims ; and 3 the district_court refused to admit evidence with respect to the allegedly inequitable_conduct
these assertions are not supported by the record

one month prior to trial bentleys counsel sought declaratory judgment of non-infringement with respect to the bellows_claims
shiley objected because bentley had successfully prevented discovery with respect to its experimental bellows_oxygenators by raising the attorney/client privilege
the trial_court attempted to determine what effect denial of the counterclaim would have on bentleys rights
in response to the trial_courts statement that it did not know how the doctrine of res judicata applied in patent cases i.e. whether a defendant could later proceed against unadjudicated claims of a patent and an invitation to counsel to comment counsel for bentley stated mr. lyon there is one problem that worries me your honor
that is if after this trial we decided to make a bellows-type device will we be precluded from asserting invalidity of those claims in view of the proceedings today ?
if your ruling is such that that might be preserved to us then we have no objection to your honor so ruling
contrary to bentleys appellate brief bentley presented no evidence to the trial_court that the bellows_oxygenator was being made
instead bentley stated only that they might be made in the future and did not object to the courts ruling

bentleys second assertion that it was prepared to prove that shiley engaged in inequitable_conduct in its dealings with the pto by concealing an on-sale_bar with respect to the bellows_claims is not supported by evidence
the evidence consists of two documents written by bentleys counsel and a proposed issue of fact for the jury
one document is defendants exhibit 298 a copy of a memorandum to file containing a statement that` discovery has established that the s-100 was on sale in public use and illustrated in printed publications more than a year prior to that date' without elaboration
the other document is defendants exhibit 297 a letter which contains no mention of the on-sale_bar
the proposed jury question of course is not evidence

even if these documents could have raised the issue of an on-sale_bar bentley is unable to argue prejudice from the district_courts refusal to admit them because these exhibits were offered and accepted into evidence

bentley also argues that the district_courts denial of the declaratory_judgment_counterclaim allowed shiley to narrow the scope of the adjudicated claims during trial thereby precluding bentley from asserting certain prior_art against the claims in issue
bentleys argument with respect to its allegedly invalidating prior_art falls because the prior_art was offered and accepted into evidence at trial

jury interrogatories/inequitable_conduct
bentley argues that shiley engaged in inequitable_conduct by concealing material prior_art from the pto during prosecution of its patents and that it is entitled to a new_trial because the jury made no findings of materiality and intent
the issue was submitted to the jury as follows

*1570 objection to the form of all the questions presented to the jury was made by both parties

the special verdict form presented to the jury was accompanied by clear and complete instructions
this approach is not error
see weinar v. rollform inc. 744_f.2d_797 223_uspq_369_(fed.cir.1984) cert
denied 470_u.s._1084 105_s.ct._1844 85_l.ed.2d_143_(1985)
had the jury found that a misrepresentation or omission had been made then questions of materiality and intent would arise
since the jury answered no to interrogatory 9 a supra and this finding was supported by substantial_evidence no further inquiry was necessary

inflammatory statement
bentley argues that its motion for new_trial should have been granted because the district_court committed prejudicial_error by allowing shileys counsel to cross examine mr._bentley and elicit an admission that his company had been adjudged a willful infringer in prior litigation with a third party
as shiley points out bentley neglects to mention that it laid the groundwork for shileys questions during its own direct examination
mr._bentley testified on direct examination that bentley had not copied the shiley s-100 that he had not seen the s-100 prior to the production of the bos-10 that he was president chief executive officer and chairman of the board of bentley and that he was intimately involved in the development of bentley devices
he also testified as to his integrity and personal involvement in avoiding` conflict' with other patents

bentley had made a pre-trial admission that it had possession of four models of the s-100 prior to the development of the bos-10
mr._bentleys credibility was squarely placed in issue by his direct testimony
he stated on cross-examination that he personally maintained a policy of avoiding infringement of other firms patents
the district_court over timely objection permitted shiley to impeach the witness using a detailed recitation of mr._bentleys activities as recorded in the opinion in deknatel inc. v. bentley sales inc. 173_uspq_129_(c.d.calif.1971)
we find no error in the judges ruling under these circumstances
fed.r.evid
608_and_611

jury instruction/damages
bentley argues it is entitled to a new_trial because the district_courts instruction *1571 on damages over objection asked the jury to assess damages from december 27 1977 the issue_date of the264 product patent
bentley claims that shiley did not prove marking of the s-100 with notice of the264_patent and pursuant to 35 u.s.c.¡± 287 shiley may only rely upon february 6 1979 the issue_date of the288 method patent as the commencement date for any damages
an examination of the record reveals that the objection bentley made was to` all parts of the verdict form' [ emphasis ours ]
this objection does not conform to the requirements of fed.r.civ.p
51 and is insufficient to preserve this type of error on appeal
further it appears from the record that marking of the s-100 was not in issue at trial

we have considered bentleys arguments with regard to prejudgment_interest and find them without merit

we have carefully considered bentleys other arguments and citations to precedent and the record
we find them devoid of merit
the judgment appealed from is affirmed
