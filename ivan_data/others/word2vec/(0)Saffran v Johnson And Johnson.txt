johnson & johnson and cordis_corporation collectively` cordis' appeal from the final judgment of the united_states_district_court for the eastern_district of texas in favor of dr. bruce n. saffran` saffran' in which the district_court held cordis liable for infringing claims 1-3 6 8 9 11 13 15 and 17 of saffrans u.s._patent 5,653,760 the` ¡¬760_patent`

mar._31,_2011 ecf no._326` final_judgment`
we conclude that the district_court erroneously construed the claims of the ¡¬760_patent and that under the correct_construction cordis is entitled to a judgment of noninfringement as a matter of law
accordingly we reverse

i
background
saffran is the owner and sole named inventor of the ¡¬760_patent which is entitled` method and apparatus for managing macromolecular distribution' and concerns` the treatment of injured tissues within human or animal_bodies specifically.. the way injured tissues are joined and the way_macromolecules are directed to promote healing'
¡¬760_patent_col. 1_ll._21 -24
in particular the ¡¬760_patent discloses methods and devices for treating injured tissues by sequestering particles and macromolecules in a defined space using a selectively permeable barrier

the specification primarily describes the invention in terms of a strategy for treating serious bone_fractures known as complex or comminuted fractures where the bone has been shattered into numerous fragments
in such cases standard treatment may involve surgical intervention to align the bone fragments and affix a stabilizing device across the fracture_site in order to enable new bone to form between and eventually unite the fragments during healing
the specification teaches that such complex fractures often heal poorly requiring repeated operations and leading to permanent disability
see id
col. 1_l._43 -col. 2_l._16

the specification describes several cellular and molecular processes that may influence clinical outcomes following a complex fracture
for one cells at the site of injury secrete growth-promoting proteins growth_factors into the interfragmentary_spaces where those proteins can in sufficient concentrations stimulate cellular proliferation and the assembly of a` scaffolding' matrix between fragments that serves as a prelude to new bone formation
if the local concentration of growth_factors is too low the scaffolding process does not occur-small bone fragments instead remain isolated and are eventually absorbed by the body leaving persistent and ever-larger gaps between the major fragments
in addition when bone_growth_factors diffuse away from the fracture_site and into adjacent soft tissues they can spur calcification *552 and heterotopic bone growth within the muscles which can permanently limit the patients range of motion
id
col. 2_ll._17 -64

to improve the treatment of such injuries the ¡¬760_patent discloses` a unique_method of fracture_stabilization and a means to restrain interfragmentary_macromolecules using a single flexible minimally porous_sheet'
id
col. 7_ll._34 -36
for purposes of the ¡¬760_patent substances larger than about 500 daltons1 e.g. proteins and many drugs are considered macromolecules
id
col. 8_ll._3 -6
the single-layered sheet serves as a selective barrier that blocks macromolecules and larger particles such as tissue fragments and cells yet contains micropores sized to allow free passage for small molecules e.g. water
see id
col. 13_ll._39 -57
other sheets might be designed to screen molecules according to properties such as ionic charge or hydrophobicity rather than size
id
col. 8_ll._15 -24
once selected and cut to the desired size and shape the sheet 1 is wrapped around or affixed to the fracture_site for example with staples 6 as shown below

?
¡¬760_patent fig._4 a ; see also id
col. 16_ll._13 -47
because of the inventions barrier properties the growth_factors and other macromolecules 8 produced by the injured tissues at the fracture_site are restrained and concentrated within the interfragmentary_spaces 4 as illustrated in a cross-sectional diagram of the device after implantation

?
*553 ¡¬760_patent fig._4 b
in addition to pre-formed sheets the specification also discloses that` the invention can be applied to the site of injury as a spray.. such that it is deposited as a thin_film on the tissue.. to maximize the surface area being treated while minimizing the need to dissect and staple'

col. 18_ll._29 -47

fig._6 b

in addition to its above-described properties the sheet can also be configured to deliver a drug or other therapeutic agent a` treating material' to the treatment site
in such embodiments the ¡¬760_patent teaches that the treating material` is affixed directly to one surface of the minimally-porous_sheet'
id
col. 8_ll._3 1-32
in particular the ¡¬760_patent describes affixing a treating material 12 to one side of the sheet 1 through a hydrolyzable_chemical_bond 24 which in the preferred_embodiment can be severed to release the treating material by means of water molecules present at the treatment site.2 id
col. 14_ll._65 -67
figure 3a of the ¡¬760_patent represents a sheet configured for drug delivery as described above

¡¬760_patent fig._3 a. lysis of the bonds occurs at a constant rate releasing a steady dose of treating material
id
col. 14_l._43 -col. 15_l._20 col. 22_ll._4 -17
*554 moreover because the released treating material 10 is too large to pass through the minimally porous_sheet the disclosed device can deliver such therapeutics in a spatially directed manner-generally the treating material is delivered from and then maintained adjacent to the side of the sheet facing the injured tissue as illustrated in the ¡¬ 760 patent

?
¡¬760_patent fig._3 b

as another use for the invention the ¡¬760_patent also describes intravascular_stents incorporating the disclosed technology
see id
col. 20_l._9 -col. 21_l._3
according to the specification vascular plaques form in response to microscopic injuries to a blood_vessel_wall` when the vessel attempts to heal neighboring cells [ secrete ] a series of macromolecules topatch the defect
if the macromolecules are not kept substantially in place they will be swept away by moving blood.. [ t ] he sooner the injury is repaired the smaller the resulting plaque will be'
id
col. 20_ll._14 -21
in this regard the ¡¬760_patent criticizes prior_art_stents consisting of an open wire mesh because the holes 27 in the mesh between adjacent stent struts 29 are so large that` both cells and macromolecules [ 8 ] are free to move through them' and into the blood_vessel_lumen 38 id
col. 20_ll._34 -38 as illustrated below

¡¬760_patent fig._8 c. the specification notes prior_art u.s._patent 5,383,928` scott' as an improvement to the traditional open mesh_stent design incorporating a` sheath that can cover the metallic_mesh of a porous stent thereby somewhat limiting its *555 porosity'
¡¬760_patent_col. 20_ll._38 -45 ; see also id
fig._8 d. the ¡¬760_patent also observes that scott described embedding a drug within the sheath for local delivery but explains that scott` does not have means to restrain macromolecules between their sheath and the vessel_wall' and therefore can not provide`directional_drug_delivery means necessary to restrain the medicine that their sheath delivers'
id
col. 20_ll._42 -58

in contrast the minimally porous_sheet of the ¡¬760_patent` provides the means to restrain the macromolecules elaborated by the healing tissue as well as the ability to restrain any number of medicines in the space adjacent to the injured blood_vessel_wall'

the drawings show the disclosed minimally porous_sheet 1 wrapped around a mesh_stent and positioned inside a partly occluded blood vessel containing an atherosclerotic plaque 18
the sheet has treating material 12 bound to one side facing the blood_vessel_wall 39

the specification of the ¡¬760_patent concludes with 18 claims reciting devices and methods for treating damaged tissues using the disclosed minimally porous devices
independent_claims 1_and_8 are representative 1

on october 9 2007 saffran filed suit against cordis alleging infringement of the ¡¬760_patent
according to the complaint cordis infringed by making using and selling drug-eluting stents marketed under the brand name cypherthe_r
briefly the accused stents comprise a metallic_mesh with a microscopic layer of polymer that coats the surface of each strut
the coating applied to the cordis_stents contains two polymers mixed with the macromolecular drug sirolimus,3 which diffuses out of *557 the device in a controlled fashion after implantation gradually escaping through gaps in the polymer_matrix over a 90-day period
the holes between the coated struts remain open as shown in images of the accused products

?
the district_court conducted markman proceedings to construe several disputed claim_limitations
saffran v. johnson & johnson 740_f.supp.2d_899 e.d.tex.2010` claim_construction_order`
the district_court first addressed the term` device' which it viewed as non-limiting preamble language that` merely gives a descriptive_name to the set of limitations in the body of the claim'
id.at 911
accordingly the district_court construed` device' as used in the claims of the ¡¬760_patent to mean` a device having the limitations called out by the body of the claim'
id
the district_court also interpreted the language` minimally porous to macromolecules' as meaning` substantially impermeable to macromolecules' in view of the phrases ordinary_meaning and the ¡¬760_patents specification
id.at 913-14
finally the district_court concluded that the language` means for release of at least one treating material in a directional_manner' is a means-plus-function_limitation governed by 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
6.4 accordingly the district_court held that the function of the claimed` means for release' is` to release a drug preferentially toward the damaged tissue' and defined the corresponding_structures disclosed in the ¡¬760_patents specification as` chemical_bonds and linkages'
id.at 914-19

the case proceeded to trial and the jury returned a verdict in favor of saffran on january 28 2011
specifically the jury found that the ¡¬760_patent was not proven invalid ; that cordis had willfully infringed the ¡¬760_patent through the manufacture use and sale of its accused stent_products ; and that saffran was entitled to damages totaling $ 482,000,000
saffran v. johnson & johnson no._207-cv-451 2011_wl_1299607 at *1 e.d.tex
mar._31,_2011
after the verdict cordis moved for judgment as a matter of law on invalidity infringement willfulness and damages
the district_court held that sufficient evidence supported the jurys conclusions as to invalidity infringement and damages denying cordiss motions on those grounds
id.at *2-8 *10-11
regarding willfulness however the district_court determined that saffran had not satisfied the objective prong of the willfulness test and therefore granted cordiss motion for judgment as a matter of law on that issue
id.at *8-9
having upheld the jurys calculation of damages the district_court awarded an additional $ 111,364,281 in prejudgment interest bringing the total award to $ 593,364,281

discussion
claim construction is an issue` exclusively within the province of the court'
markman v. westview instruments inc. 517_u.s._370 372 116_s.ct._1384 134_l.ed.2d_577_(1996)
we apply regional circuit law in assessing the grant or denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law
summit tech. inc. v. nidek co. 363_f.3d_1219 1223 fed.cir.2004
the fifth circuit reviews orders granting or denying a motion for judgment as a matter of law without deference applying` the same standard to review the verdict that the district_court used in first passing on the motion'
hiltgen v. sumrall 47_f.3d_695 699 5th cir.1995
accordingly judgment as a matter of law is appropriate if` the facts and inferences point so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of one party that the court concludes that reasonable jurors could not arrive at a contrary verdict'
bellows v. amoco oil co. 118_f.3d_268 273 5th cir.1997

on appeal cordis disputes inter alia the district_courts construction of the claim_limitations` device' and` release means for release of an at least one treating material in a directional_manner'
under the correct_constructions according to cordis its products can not be found to infringe the ¡¬760_patent as a matter of law
we will consider those arguments as set forth below

a
claim construction
1
device
the term` device' appears in every claim of the ¡¬760_patent -in the preamble and body of independent_claim 1 in the bodies of independent_claims 8_and_15 and at least by reference in each of the dependent_claims
in its claim_construction_order the district_court nonetheless concluded that as used in the ¡¬760_patent the term` device' serves only as non-limiting preamble language that does not require a sheet and` merely gives a descriptive_name to the set of limitations in the body of the claim that set forth the invention'
740 f.supp.2d at 911

cordis argues that the term` device' should be construed to mean a continuous_sheet
according to cordis the specification of the ¡¬760_patent consistently and exclusively describes the device of the invention as a sheet
furthermore cordis asserts the ¡¬760_patent highlights the sheets ability to sequester macromolecules near an injury as a` critical' feature of the invention while criticizing stents with uncovered mesh holes as unable to prevent tissue_macromolecules from escaping
cordis also contends that during prosecution of the ¡¬760_patent saffran defined the claimed` device' as a sheet in attempting to overcome cited prior_art and that he therefore can not now assert a broader meaning in litigation
finally cordis argues that the district_court erroneously relied on certain embodiments described in the ¡¬ 760 patent as disclosing alternatives to rather than forms of a sheet

saffran responds that the district_court correctly declined to limit the term` device' to require a sheet
saffran accuses cordis of limiting the claims to certain preferred_embodiments while ignoring other disclosures
furthermore saffran contends that cordis misunderstands the inventions macromolecular restraint function arguing that the disclosed device need not restrain all macromolecules from all injured tissue
instead according to saffran the device must simply be capable of restraining at least one type of macromolecule at locations where the stent strut contacts the blood_vessel_wall
finally saffran asserts that the prosecution_history of the ¡¬760_patent evinces no clear and unambiguous_disavowal of claim_scope and *559 instead supports a broad reading of the asserted claims

we conclude that saffrans statements during prosecution of the ¡¬760_patent limit` device' to a continuous_sheet
on multiple occasions during prosecution saffran sought to distinguish prior_art by representing to the examiner that` [ t ] he device used is a sheet rather than a pre formed chamber gaskill'
j.a
1100 1119 1127
saffran contends that his statements merely disclaimed the rigid pre-formed chambers disclosed in u.s._patent 4,911,717` gaskill' without further limiting the invention to a sheet
while saffran surely disclaimed preformed chambers during prosecution we disagree that his statements have such limited import

saffrans arguments to the examiner presented two bases for distinguishing gaskill i that his device is a sheet and ii that his device is not a pre-formed chamber
even if as saffran suggests the examiner had relied only on the latter that would not annul the remainder of his statement
`` rather as we have made clear an applicants argument that a prior_art_reference is distinguishable on a particular ground can serve as a disclaimer of claim_scope even if the applicant distinguishes the reference on other grounds as well'
andersen corp. v. fiber composites llc 474_f.3d_1361 1374 fed.cir.2007
furthermore the record before us makes clear that the examiner shared saffrans stated view of the claimed device as a continuous_sheet
in recording his reasons for allowance the examiner noted that` [ t ] he claimed invention embodies a unique_method of [ macromolecular restraint ] using a single flexible minimally porous_sheet layer'
j.a
530

to be sure a prosecution_disclaimer requires` clear and unambiguous_disavowal of claim_scope' storage_tech corp. v. cisco sys. inc. 329_f.3d_823 833 fed.cir.2003 but applicants rarely submit affirmative disclaimers along the lines of` i hereby disclaim the following..' during prosecution and need not do so to meet the applicable standard
in this case saffrans unqualified assertion that` the device used is a sheet' extends beyond illuminating` how the inventor understood the invention' phillips v. awh_corp. 415_f.3d_1303 1317 fed.cir.2005 en banc to provide an affirmative definition for the disputed term
given such definitive statements during prosecution the interested public was entitled to conclude that the` device' recited in the claims of the ¡¬760_patent is a continuous_sheet

saffrans arguments alleging that the ¡¬760_patent contains contrary embodiments are not persuasive
saffran first contends that the` spray' embodiment disclosed in the ¡¬760_patent does not yield an unbroken_sheet but forms a layer only where it contacts bone or some other solid surface such as the struts of a stent
but the record belies that assertion
the figures illustrating the spray_embodiment show a spray nozzle depositing a continuous unbroken_sheet that spans open gaps between individual bone fragments
¡¬760_patent_figs
6a-b ; see also id
col. 12_ll._21 -22
more fundamentally and as saffran acknowledged during trial the ¡¬760_patent never mentions spraying the device onto a stent or any other support substrate except the injured tissue itself
see e.g. id
col. 1big_token__8_ll._3__big_token 0-32 explaining that the spray` is deposited in a thin_film on the tissue` emphasis added
on that very basis in fact saffran attempted to distinguish his spray_embodiment from a prior_art vascular graft disclosed in u.s._patent 5,152,782` kowligi' that was subjected to spray coating before implantation` the critical difference here is that kowligi disclose [ s ] a way to make their device while i *560 disclose a way to deploy mine'
j.a
385
the ¡¬760_patents spray_embodiment thus concerns depositing a continuous_sheet of material onto injured tissue not preparing a support structure such as a stent for later implantation into a patient

the specification supports this conclusion
throughout its specification the ¡¬760_patent consistently describes the disclosed` device' as a sheet whether wrapped around a stent affixed to a fractured bone or applied as a spray
see e.g. ¡¬760_patent at [ 57 ]` the device is composed of a single_sheet of material..' ; id
col. 7_ll._35 -37` the invention is a unique_method.. to restrain interfragmentary_macromolecules using a single flexible minimally porous_sheet
`` ; id
col. 13_l._39_(stating_that_''[t]he_device,_1,_is_composed_of_a_single_sheet_of_material'') ; id
col. 14_ll._34 -42` attachment of a treating material to the device of the invention i have found unexpectedly that medicine or other treating materials can be attached directly to the flexible minimally-porous_sheet..' ; see id
col. 16_ll._8 -47 using the terms` device'` sheet' and` the invention' interchangeably
in addition every drawing in the ¡¬760_patent depicts the claimed device as a sheet
e.g. id
figs
4a 5a 8e ; see also id
col. 12_ll._21 -22 defining reference numeral 1 which appears in every figure depicting the invention,5 as a` [ s ] ingle-layered flexible minimally-porous_sheet having macromolecular restrainment means'
extensive consistent usage in the specification therefore suggests that the claimed` device' should be understood as a sheet which rather than confining the term to a single embodiment would accord with every embodiment and description presented in the ¡¬760_patent not to mention the prosecution_history

furthermore the ¡¬760_patent emphasizes macromolecular containment as a key_feature of the invention and in the specific context of vascular_stents expressly relies on the sheet to distinguish the claimed device from prior_art open mesh_stents
the specification describes the devices ability to restrain tissue_macromolecules near the site of injury as a` cardinal' and` exceedingly important' feature of the invention
¡¬760_patent_col. 7_ll._38 -46 col. 20_ll._49 -51
the specification also criticizes prior_art_stents as unable to restrain macromolecules between the stent and the vessel_wall ; according to the ¡¬760_patent prior_art_stents` are porous meshes' characterized by holes so large that` both cells and large macromolecules are free to move through them'
id
col. 20_ll._22 -48 ; compare id
fig._8 c showing tissue_macromolecules 8 passing through the holes 27 between the struts 29 of a prior_art open-mesh_stent and into the vessel lumen with id
fig._8 e showing sheet 1 covering holes 27 and containing tissue_macromolecules 8 between the device and the vessel_wall
in short the specification makes clear that restraining tissue_macromolecules is not only a key_feature of the invention but also one that open mesh_stents can not provide
therefore reading the claim_term` device' to both require a sheet and exclude stents having open_mesh_holes` most naturally aligns with the patents description of the invention'
ormco corp. v. align tech. inc. 498_f.3d_1307 1313 fed.cir.2007 quoting phillips 415 f.3d at 1316

finally saffran relies on an alleged` stent coating' embodiment in the specification
but that` embodiment' is no more *561 than an isolated phrase taken out of context ; the cited passage occurs in a section summarizing potential uses of the previously described sheet-wrapped vascular_stents within the biliary or digestive systems
see id
col. 21_ll._5 -37` the stent coating properties of this device are not limited to use within the vascular system
`` ; see also id
figs
9a-b
the cited passage is consistent with interpreting the device as a continuous_sheet

in summary we reverse the district_courts claim construction and construe the term` device' as used in the claims of the ¡¬760_patent to mean a continuous_sheet and to exclude stents having open_mesh_holes
while the district_court was clearly correct that the term` device' must possess all the` limitations in the body of the claim' the term itself requires construction beyond those limitations as we have indicated above

release_means
cordis also disputes the district_courts construction of the` release means' limitation recited in each independent_claim of the ¡¬760_patent
the claims require a` means for release of an at least one treating material in a directional_manner' ¡¬760_patent_col. 22_ll._4 1-43,6 and the district_court construed that language as a means-plus-function_limitation governed by 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
6
the district_court identified the claimed function as` to release a drug preferentially toward the damaged tissue' and the corresponding_structure as` chemical_bonds and linkages'
claim_construction_order 740 f.supp.2d at 916-19
on appeal cordis and saffran agree that the disputed claim_language should be analyzed as a means-plus-function_limitation pursuant to ¡± 112 ?
6 ; neither side disputes the district_courts definition of the claimed function
the parties differ however as to the district_courts identification of corresponding_structures disclosed to carry out that function

cordis argues that the district_court erred in identifying the corresponding_structures disclosed in the ¡¬760_patent
according to cordis the district_courts generic construction is overbroad erroneously sweeping undisclosed types of` chemical_bonds and linkages' into the scope of the claims
cordis contends that the correct structure is a hydrolyzable_bond-the only type of bond identified in the ¡¬760_patent for performing the claimed directional drug release_function

in contrast saffran defends the district_courts construction as correct under ¡± 112 ?
6 arguing that the ¡¬760_patent broadly discloses` chemical_bonds and linkages' as a clear category of structures that would be readily understood by one of ordinary_skill in the art as suitable for performing the claimed function

we conclude that although the district_court correctly identified the claimed function as` to release a drug preferentially toward the damaged tissue' it erred in identifying the corresponding_structure disclosed in the specification
the claimed structure for the` release means' limitation is correctly construed as a hydrolyzable_bond

under ¡± 112 ?
6 a means-plus-function claim` shall be construed to cover the corresponding_structure material or acts described in the specification or equivalents thereof'
35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
6 *562 2006 emphasis added
we have held that` structure disclosed in the specification iscorresponding structure only if the specification or prosecution_history clearly links or associates that structure to the function recited in the claim
this duty to link or associate structure to function is the quid pro quo for the convenience of employing ¡± 112 ?
6'
b. braun med. inc. v. abbott_labs. 124_f.3d_1419 1424 fed.cir.1997

applying those standards we agree with cordis that the types of bonds set forth in the ¡¬760_patent as corresponding to the claimed release_function are limited to hydrolyzable_bonds
the specification repeatedly describes the linkage between treating materials and the sheet as a hydrolyzable_bond
e.g. ¡¬760_patent_col. 8_ll._3 7-43` [ i ] f one wishes to release medicine.. at different rates one simply has to manufacture the device with bonds that become hydrolyzed at a different rate`
moreover the specification distinguishes the invention over the prior_art based on the use of hydrolyzable_bonds a surprising new feature of this device is the improvement in the medicine release kinetics compared to the prior_art
whereas [ prior_art devices ] rely on the random diffusion of medicine from micropores i have found that i can achieve a prolonged duration and much more stable rate of efflux from the device when medicine is attached using a hydrolyzable_bond
id
col. 14_ll._53 -61
at a minimum it is thus clear that the specification sets forth hydrolyzable_bonds as at least one structure linked to the release_function of the claims

the ¡¬760_patent does not however link any additional structures to the release_function with sufficient_specificity to satisfy ¡± 112 ?
6
in arguing otherwise saffran again relies on fragmentary statements taken out of context from the specification
for example saffran points to a statement in the ¡¬760_patent that` the linkages can be made of any suitable_bond'
but the full passage states` in the preferred_embodiment these linkages are hydrolyzable by the water within the interfragmentary space ; however the linkages can be made of any suitable_bond e.g. a bond that requires a particular enzyme for hydrolysis'
id
col. 14_l._65 -col. 15_l._2
read in context` suitable' bonds may thus include hydrolyzable_bonds that unlike the preferred_embodiment can not be broken by water alone and may also require for example an enzyme to trigger hydrolysis
no non-hydrolyzable_bonds are discussed or suggested
similarly saffran stresses another isolated passage from the specification suggesting that one of the figures shows a medicine` affixed to the invention by means of a chemical_bond'
id
col. 14_ll._43 -45
elsewhere in the specification however the specific description of that same figure clarifies that it depicts a hydrolyzable_chemical_bond` this drawing shows an embodiment in which a treating material has been affixed to the invention
in this example medicine is attached to the invention using a hydrolyzable_chemical_bond'
id
col. 10_ll._10 -13
in another instance saffran mischaracterizes the specifications disclosure that certain sheet materials may restrain macromolecules by physical properties such as charge or hydrophobicity rather than size ; that portion of the specification relates to the sheets ability to block macromolecules from passing and does not as saffran suggests concern drug delivery let alone affirmatively disclose ionic or so-called` hydrophobic' bonds between a treating material and the sheet as structures that correspond to the` release means' limitation
see id
col. 8_ll._15 -24
accordingly we are not persuaded that the specifications scattered use of the generic phrase` chemical_bonds' *563 conveys additional specific corresponding_structures separate and apart from hydrolyzable_bonds

in urging otherwise saffran has expended considerable effort arguing that given the claimed function a person of ordinary_skill would` understand the range of chemical_bonds and linkages that could be used'
appellees br
60 2012_wl_2375038
as we have explained however` [ a ] patentee can not avoid providing specificity as to structure simply because someone of ordinary_skill in the art would be able to devise a means to perform the claimed function'
blackboard inc. v. desire2learn inc. 574_f.3d_1371 1385 fed.cir.2009
under ¡± 112 ?
6 the question is not what structures a person of ordinary_skill in the art would know are capable of performing a given function but what structures are specifically disclosed and tied to that function in the specification

saffran also argues that limiting the disclosed corresponding_structures to hydrolyzable_bonds would make dependent_claim 3-which specifies drug release` by lysis of a chemical_bond' -broader than claim 1 citing wenger manufacturing inc. v. coating machinery systems inc. 239_f.3d_1225_(fed.cir.2001)
in wenger the district_court had construed the means-plus-function term` air_circulation means' in an independent_claim to require structures for both circulating and recirculating air even though the recirculation function was recited separately in a dependent_claim and the specification disclosed distinct structures for performing the two functions
239 f.3d at 1232-35
in that case we held that claim_differentiation supported the conclusion that` air_circulation means'` should not be interpreted as requiring structure capable of performing the additional function of recirculation' that was entirely absent from the independent_claim
id.at 1234 emphasis added
but that is not the case before us
here claims 1_and_3 concern the same function and the only structure disclosed in the ¡¬760_patent for performing that function is a hydrolyzable_bond
in such circumstances we have long held that a patentee can not rely on claim_differentiation to broaden a means-plus-function_limitation beyond those structures specifically disclosed in the specification
laitram corp. v. rexnord inc. 939_f.2d_1533 1538 fed.cir.1991
saffrans claim_differentiation arguments are therefore unavailing and we conclude that hydrolyzable_bonds are the sole type of chemical_bond linked to the claimed` release means' function in the specification

in view of the foregoing we conclude i that the` release means' limitation recited in the claims of the ¡¬760_patent is a means-plus-function_limitation governed by ¡± 112 ?
6 ; ii that the recited function is` to release a drug preferentially toward the damaged tissue' ; and iii that` hydrolyzable_bonds' constitute the corresponding_structures disclosed in the ¡¬760_patent s specification.7

b
infringement
as described above we agree with cordis that the district_court misconstrued the` device' and` release means' limitations of the asserted claims
cordis further contends that applying the correct_constructions it is entitled to a judgment of noninfringement as a matter of law
*564 specifically cordis argues that its accused stents both lack a sheet covering the open_mesh_holes between their struts and lack a drug affixed to their surfaces via hydrolyzable_bonds and therefore can not infringe the asserted claims
we agree

1
device
under the correct_construction of the term` device' cordis can not infringe the asserted_apparatus or method_claims unless its accused stent_products include a continuous_sheet and lack uncovered holes in the stent mesh
the accused cordis_stents all exhibit a metallic_mesh structure their struts coated with a thin layer comprising polymer and sirolimus
but that layer is akin to paint on a chain link fence not a continuous_sheet wrapped around the mesh and open holes remain between the struts of the accused devices-as saffran has acknowledged
therefore no reasonable jury could conclude that cordiss accused stents infringe the asserted claims of the ¡¬760_patent and cordis is entitled to a judgment of noninfringement as a matter of law

2
release_means
in addition our construction of the` release means' limitation provides a separate and independent basis for a judgment of noninfringement
as construed each of the asserted_apparatus and method_claims requires a treating material attached to the substantially impermeable sheet via hydrolyzable_bonds or an equivalent thereof 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
6 but the sirolimus provided by the cordis products is not attached by hydrolyzable_bonds
it is instead embedded within the polymer layer and held in place by intermolecular` hydrophobic' interactions that facilitate its slow diffusion through the polymer_matrix
saffran has not argued otherwise
moreover saffran stipulated before trial that he would not pursue any infringement arguments representing that so-called` hydrophobic' interactions are equivalent to hydrolyzable_bonds and he is therefore precluded from doing so now
see saffran v. johnson & johnson no._207-cv-451 e.d
tex
dec._1,_2010 cordis motion in limine ecf no._185 ; saffran v. johnson & johnson no._207-cv-451 e.d.tex
jan._13,_2011 order granting stipulated motion ecf no._2 69
accordingly cordis is also entitled to a judgment of noninfringement because its accused products do not satisfy the properly construed` release means' limitation

3
remaining arguments
because we hold that cordis does not infringe the asserted claims of the ¡¬ 760 patent as correctly construed we need not reach cordiss additional contention that its products are not` minimally porous to macromolecules' as further required by the claims

iii
conclusion
the district_court erred in construing the asserted claims of the ¡¬760_patent ; because the accused products do not satisfy those claims as correctly construed cordis is entitled to a judgment of noninfringement as a matter of law
we therefore reverse the judgment of the district_court

reversed

moore circuit_judge concurring-in-part
i join judge_louries opinion except for parts_ii-a-2 and ii-b-2
respectfully i conclude that the district_court adopted the correct claim construction of` release means'
the only issue in dispute is the identification of the corresponding_structure for the release means
the district_court concluded that the corresponding *565 structure was` chemical_bonds and linkages'
i agree
the specification is clear` [ t ] he rate of healing can be.. accelerated by attachment of a treating material either mechanically or by chemical_bond to the inner surface of the device' which includes a` method of medicine release by chemical_bond'
¡¬760_patent col. 22_l._4 -7
this passage directly associates the claimed` release means' with the chemical_bond structure which is sufficiently specific to satisfy ¡± 112 ?
6
see e.g. med
inst
& diagnostics corp. v. elekta ab 344_f.3d_1205 1213-14 fed.cir.2003 explaining that ¡± 112 ?
6 requires only` some link between a generic structural reference and a claimed function' understandable to a person of skill in the art
i simply can not fathom what more the patentee must do` to link or associate structure to function' so as to provide` sufficient_specificity'
op.at 561-62
by limiting the structure to` hydrolyzable_bonds' my colleagues punish the patentee for providing a detailed description of his preferred_embodiment

my colleagues erroneous construction of the` release means' limitation is all the more puzzling because it is unnecessary to resolve this case
as parts_ii-a-1 and ii-b-1 convincingly explain the clear prosecution_disclaimer of` devices' other than` sheets' mandates reversal of the infringement verdict
parts_ii-a-2 and ii-b-2 are thus entirely dicta
for these reasons i decline to join parts_ii-a-2 and ii-b-2

o'malley circuit_judge concurring in part
i concur in the result my colleagues reach today because i agree that under the proper construction of the` release means' limitation cordis does not infringe the asserted claims of u.s._patent_no._5653,760` the ¡¬760_patent` or` the patent'
i disagree however with my colleagues construction of the term` device'
accordingly i do not join parts_ii-a-1 or ii-b-1 of the majority_opinion

i
construction of` device' the majority construes` device' to mean a continuous_sheet that excludes stents with open_mesh_holes
majority_op.at 557-61
upon review of the intrinsic_record i do not agree
the claim_language is broad and the written description while focused on the treatment of fractured_bones with a sheet discloses a host of other_embodiments and treatment applications
several of those embodiments can not fairly be characterized as sheets
and i find no clear and unambiguous disclaimer of those embodiments in the prosecution_history
accordingly i would affirm the district_courts construction of` device' as something which comprises the limitations set out in the body of the claim

turning first to the claim_language it does not limit the claimed` device' to a` sheet'
it only describes three characteristics of the` device' it comprises a layer ; it is` capable of being shaped in three dimensions by manipulation by hands ;' and it is` capable of substantially restricting the through passage of at least one type of macromolecule_therethrough'
¡¬760_patent_col. 22_ll._29 -47
as my colleagues recognize` device' is a generic term majority_op.at 558 that under its common usage is not limited to devices in the form of a sheet
accordingly the proper inquiry before us is whether the meaning of` device' as it appears in the asserted claims is narrowed by the written description or prosecution_history
in my opinion it is not

to find a special_definition mandated by the written description a term must be` clearly' redefined and an` express_intent' to do so must be evident from the *566 patent
see elekta instrument s.a. v. o.u.r
scientific int l inc. 214_f.3d_1302 1307 fed.cir.2000` while we have held many times that a patentee can act as his own_lexicographer to specifically define terms of a claim contrary to their ordinary_meaning the written description in such a case must clearly redefine a claim_term so as to put a reasonable competitor or one reasonably skilled in the art on notice that the patentee intended to so redefine that claim_term
absent an express_intent to impart a novel meaning claim_terms take on their ordinary_meaning'
( citations and internal_quotation_marks omitted ; see also edwards lifesciences llc v. cook inc. 582_f.3d_1322 1329 fed.cir.2009` similarly we will adopt a definition that is different from the ordinary_meaning when the patentee acted as his own_lexicographer and clearly set forth a definition of the disputed claim_term in either the specification or prosecution_history'
( internal_quotation_marks omitted ; cannon rubber ltd. v. the first years inc. 163_fed.appx._870 875 fed.cir.2005` these two cited instances however do not clearly indicate that the patentee intended to assign a more narrow definition to the phrasein the body than it would otherwise possess`
in my view the patent contains no clear definition of` device' or express_intent to narrow its meaning

admittedly in many instances the patent includes descriptions of the invention being composed of a sheet,1 accomplishing certain functionality using a sheet,2 or being provided as a sheet.3 those statements standing alone could conceivably impart a special_definition to` device' by implication.4 when read as a whole however the written description detracts from the notion that` device' has a special meaning
although it focuses on the treatment of fractured_bones with a sheet the written description discloses numerous other physical forms which the patented invention can take some of which decidedly are not sheets
it describes a sheet as one possible embodiment
see e.g. ¡¬760_patent_col. 7_ll._57 -60` according to one embodiment a single_sheet that is flexible in three dimensions and minimally porous to macromolecules is wrapped around or affixed to a fractured_tissue
`` ; id
col. 13_l._66 -col
14_l._2_(``the_principal_embodiment_of_the_present_invention_is_a_sheet_with_the_same_characteristics_as_the_malleable,_minimally-porous_anchoring_component,_3,_of_the_malleable_fracture_stabilization_device_with_micropores.``)
it is almost unnecessary to restate that` although the specification often describes very specific embodiments of the invention we have repeatedly warned against confining the claims to those embodiments'
phillips v. awh_corp. 415_f.3d_1303 1323 fed.cir.2005 en banc

*567 a close look at the written description reveals the breadth of its disclosure
the written description begins with a` background of the invention' section with a` field of the invention' subsection stating the` invention relates to the treatment of injured tissues within human or animal_bodies specifically to the way injured tissues are joined and the way_macromolecules are directed to promote healing'
¡¬760_patent_col. 1_ll._21 -24
this statement seemingly refers to embodiments relating to the treatment of fractured_bones
but the field of invention_section goes on to say that` [ a ] lthough i [ the inventor ] will frame this invention initially in terms of traumatic injuries i will also discuss this invention in the treatment of many other conditions including metastases infections metabolic_conditions such as osteoporosis primarily neoplasms and vascular_disease'
id
col. 1_ll._27 -32
this statement significantly broadens the scope of the disclosure as does the text that follows

the background section proceeds to discuss the state of the art in the field of bone_fracture_fixation in a subsection titled` description of prior art'
id
col. 1_l._33 -col. 6_l._10
but the patent notes that other injuries are also implicated by the invention` many tissues are commonly fractured in traumatic injury e.g. the liver the kidney the bowel the bladder the spleen and the testicle perhaps the most often injured tissues are the bones'
id
col. 1_ll._39 -42
returning to bone_fractures the patent discusses techniques used to treat bone_fractures problems arising when bone_fractures are treated and different fixation devices used on bone_fractures including compressions plates intramedullary rods porous substrates bone chips implantable gels injectable cements polymer coated sheets non-porous grafts and saffrans microporous device disclosed in u.s._patent application ser
no._08 /11,745 which issued as u.s._patent_no._5466,262` the ¡¬262_patent`
id
col. 2_l._43 -col. 6_l._10
still within the background of the invention_section the patent describes the present invention calling it an improvement of the device disclosed in the ¡¬ 262 patent and discussing it specifically in the context of bone_fracture_fixation
id
col. 6_ll._11 -62
but in a subsection entitled` objectives of the present invention' the patent moves beyond bone_fractures and discloses features of the invention touching upon other medical applications i.e. the invention provides` a unique_method and apparatus that can be deployed via endoscope catheter or open surgical procedure that can serve both to preferentially direct endogenous macromolecules and release treating materials while also providing structural support to hollow_viscera solid_organs or blood_vessels'
id
col. 7_ll._20 -26.5

the next subsection entitled` summary of the invention' focusing again on bone_fractures states that` [ t ] he invention is a unique_method of fracture_stabilization and way to restrain interfragmentary_macromolecules using a single flexible minimally porous_sheet'
id
col. 7_ll._34 -36
it goes on to describe aspects of the patented invention such as its one-layer construction its ability to selectively restrain macromolecules and the option of affixing treating material to its surface
id
col. 7_l._38 -col. 9_l._11
although up to now this section seems limited to bone fracture_applications the patent next states that the invention can` be introduced into the medullary cavity blood vessel and hollow_viscera using a percutaneous delivery system'
*568 id
col. 9_ll._12 -14
it discusses embodiments in which the invention is rolled up and deployed via catheter or introducer needle manufactured as a stent or deployed via endoscope
id
col. 9_ll._15 -30
these embodiments the patent explains can be used to treat the inner walls of bones blood_vessel_walls hollow_viscera lumen abscess cavities medullary cavities solid_organs e.g. the liver biliary system or hollow_organs e.g. the esophagus allowing for the treatment of inflammatory conditions or metabolic_conditions such as osteoporosis
id

after sections describing the drawings and figures of the patent a section entitled` description of the preferred embodiments' elaborates on the numerous applications for the claimed invention
this section first describes the structure of the claimed device the attachment of treating material to its surface via chemical_bond the construction material for the device and the various treating materials that can be used
id
col. 13_l._48 -col. 16_l._6
regarding potential treating materials the patent states that` [ a ] lthough originally engineered to deliver bone_growth_factors the device can deliver any of a number of treating materials including but not limited to bone morphogenetic proteins nerve growth_factors extracellular matrix components e.g. fibronectin and laminin connective tissue growth_factors such as fibroblast growth_factors antibiotics vitamins cofactors a growth factor a glycosaminoglycan a bioactive ion nuclear or ionic radiation radiofrequency a molecule produced by fractured_tissue a pharmaceutical a hormone and living cells-either wild-type or genetically engineered'
id
col. 15_l._63 -col. 16_l._6
next in a subsection entitled` operation of the invention' the patent returns to bone fracture_applications
id
col. 16_ll._7 -64
but the patent proceeds in separate subsections to discuss` several new and unexpected applications' of the inventions
id
col. 17_ll._2 -3
the invention can be used for example` to treat metastases' id
col. 17_ll._16 -46 by delivering chemotherapeutic medicines` to treat osteomyelitis' id
col. 17_ll._47 -59 to treat herniated disks id
col. 19_ll._21 -23 to treat osteoporosis id
col. 19_ll._27 -37 to treat intraabdominal abscesses resulting from diverticulitis and inflammatory bowel disease id
col. 19_l._46 -col. 20_l._7 to treat cystic tumors and aneurysms id
col. 19_ll._7 -8` to treat vascular_disease' id
col. 20_ll._9 -67` to treat mycotic aneurysms' id
col. 21_ll._1 -3 to treat malignant biliary strictures cause by pancreatic head tumors id
col. 21_l._6 -11 and to` deliver radiofrequency energy or radioactivity directed to the tumor' id
col. 21_ll._38 -47

and the invention can take many forms being applied for example` within a fenestrated im [ intramedullary ] rod' id
col. 17_l._63` as a thin_film to the surface of a solid_rod' id
col. 18_ll._12 -13 as a solid rigid krishner wire used to treat finger_fractures id
col. 18_ll._21 -29 as a spray` such that it is deposited in a thin_film on the tissue' id
col. 1big_token__8_ll._3__big_token 1-32 as a rolled up sheet id
col. 19_ll._5 -20 and as a coating for vascular and biliary stents id
col. 20_l._9 -col. 21_l._47
most pertinently when discussing the use of the invention as a coating for stents the written description states that the` device can be manufactured with any stent' id
col. 20_l._65 and has` stent coating properties' and the stents are described as` invention-coated' id
col. 21_ll._5 -7
in its final section entitled` ramifications and scope' the patent describes the device again in the context of bone_fractures id
col. 21_ll._49 -59 but then mentions applications in` the medullary canal hollow_organs and blood_vessels' id
col. 21. ll
66-67 and states that` the device and method provided is *569 not only a major advance in bone fracture treatment over the prior_art but is also a significant advance in the treatment of other seemingly unrelated soft tissue pathology' id
col. 22_ll._18 -22

in sum while long-winded and rambling at times the written description provides a broad_disclosure touching upon several medical applications and physical structures
its primary focus is the treatment of bone_fractures with a minimally-porous_sheet but it also discloses a laundry list of other_embodiments
following this broad_disclosure the patent contains several claims that are limited to no specific medical application
instead they are directed generally to devices that` promote healing of a damaged tissue' id
col. 22_l._30 methods` of treating damaged tissue to promote repair' id
col. 23_ll._14 -15 and methods` of treating tissues in human or veterinary medicine' id
col. 24_ll._13 -14
with this broad_disclosure in mind i turn to the present claim construction dispute

given the host of medical applications disclosed for the claimed device and the various structural forms the invention can take i am unable to limit the broadly worded claims to any particular embodiment or application
the term` device' provides no vehicle for doing so
it is not possible moreover to describe some of the disclosed embodiments as` sheets'
for example one would not describe a thin_film on the surface of a solid_rod see id
col. 18_ll._12 -14 or wire-like structures used to treat finger_fractures see id
col. 18_ll._21 -29 as` sheets'
this is so even if one can stretch the spray and stent-coating embodiments so as to call them sheets
see majority_op.at 559-61
additionally the patent indicates that it is the claimed` layer' as opposed to the claimed` device' that is a sheet ; it makes several references to the` minimally porous_sheet' and it is the` layer' that according to the claims is` minimally porous'
compare_¡¬760_patent_col. 22_ll._32 -34 claim 1 indicating that the` layer' is made` of flexible_material that is minimally porous to macromolecules' with id
col. 8_l._4_(``minimally-porous_sheet'') and id
col. 8_ll._3 3` the minimally-porous_sheet'
i simply can not agree that the written description clearly redefines` device' as a` sheet'
see elekta instrument 214 f.3d at 1307

the portion of my colleagues construction excluding` stents having open_mesh_holes' is unnecessary moreover
see majority_op.at 560
it is true that the patent distinguishes u.s._patent_no._5383,928` scott' because the sheath-covered stent disclosed in scott` does not have means to restrain macromolecules between their sheath and the vessel_wall' and` can not have thedirectional_drug_delivery means necessary to restrain the medicine that their sheath delivers'
¡¬760_patent_col. 20_ll._46 -55
but the claims themselves already require that` the device be [ ] capable of substantially restricting the through passage of at least one type of macromolecule_therethrough' and that` the layer hav [ e ] material_release means for release of an at least one treating material in a directional_manner..' id
col. 22_ll._4 0-41 45-47
by focusing on the stent embodiments my colleagues construction loses sight of the various other_embodiments disclosed in the written description

perhaps aware of the weakness of their position under standard claim construction principles my colleagues resort to the concept of prosecution_history disclaimer to justify reversing the district_courts construction of this claim_language
indeed they take the unusual step of beginning with a discussion of the prosecution_history elevating it to a prominence it does not deserve under phillips
as noted by this *570 court en banc` because the prosecution_history represents an ongoing negotiation between the pto and the applicant rather than the final product of that negotiation it often lacks the clarity of the specification and thus is less useful for claim construction purposes'
phillips 415 f.3d at 1317
the majority does not heed the hierarchy counseled in phillips and instead begins by finding disclaimer and then searches the specification for disclosures consistent with their take away from the prosecution_history
i can not agree with either the structure or the result of their analysis

as my colleagues concede prosecution_disclaimer requires` clear and unambiguous_disavowal of claim_scope'
storage_tech corp. v. cisco sys. inc. 329_f.3d_823 833 fed.cir.2003
the burden to show prosecution_disclaimer is high because` [ c ] laim terms are entitled to a heavy presumption that they carry their ordinary and customary meaning to those skilled in the art in light of the claim_terms usage in the patent specification'
elbex video ltd. v. sensormatic elecs corp. 508_f.3d_1366 1371 fed.cir.2007 internal_quotation_marks omitted
in this vein we have` consistently rejected prosecution_statements too vague or ambiguous to qualify as a disavowal of claim_scope'
omega_eng g inc. v. raytek corp. 334_f.3d_1314 1325 fed.cir.2003
instead` we have required the alleged disavowing statements to be both so clear as to show reasonable clarity and deliberateness and so unmistakable as to be unambiguous evidence of disclaimer'
id.at 1325 citations omitted
i see no such unambiguous deliberate disavowal in the relevant exchanges with the examiner

during prosecution saffran admittedly distinguished u.s._patent no._4911,717` gaskill' by stating that` [ t ] he device is a sheet rather than a pre formed chamber gaskill'
see a1100 ; a119 ; a1127
this statement no-doubt clearly and unambiguously disclaims the embodiments disclosed in gaskill ; i.e. pre-formed chambers
but this statement does not unambiguously limit to` sheets' all forms which the claimed device can take
there was no need to do so to differentiate the claims at issue here from what was disclosed in gaskill
gaskill was not about stents or treating bone_fractures
gaskill is addressed to an` intravascular emplaced'` artificial organ'` having a cell_culture_chamber adapted to receive living cells or tissue'
gaskill col. 3_ll._54 -58
in context the point of saffrans disclaimer over gaskill was that preformed chambers such as the disclosed` cell_culture_chamber' were not even within the scope of his claims
instead saffrans claims cover either chambers that are not pre-formed-because they are formed by the physician using a sheet6-or embodiments both with and without sheets that do not involve chambers at all
it would make no sense for saffran to disclaim multiple embodiments in his own specification that have nothing to do with pre-formed chambers when a far narrower disclaimer was sufficient to differentiate his invention from gaskill as the district_court found

although saffran made this supposedly damning disclaimer when discussing a prior_art_reference dealing with pre-formed chambers-not sheets-my colleagues feel that his disclaimer is sufficient to notify the public that saffran definitively and unambiguously redefined` device' as a` sheet'
see omega_eng g 334 f.3d at 1325` to balance the importance of public notice and the right of patentees to seek broad patent coverage we have thus consistently rejected prosecution_statements *571 too vague or ambiguous to qualify as a disavowal of claim_scope`
to find so they must not only take saffrans statement out of the context of the actual negotiation with the examiner but disregard the multiple other_embodiments disclosed in the patent
what saffran unambiguously clearly and deliberately disclaimed were pre-formed chambers
i can not find from this very directed exchange regarding gaskill that saffran unambiguously intended to disclaim such a substantial number of the embodiments disclosed in the written description

because a special_definition of` device' is not mandated by either the written description or the prosecution_history i do not join parts_ii-a-1 or ii-b-1 of the majority_opinion
i would instead affirm the district_courts construction of this term

ii
construction of` release means' limitation
as stated above i join judge_louries decision regarding the construction of the` release means' limitations
i write separately on this term only to note that since this is a means-plus-function element construed under 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
6 the scope of the term is inherently narrowed by the disclosure
therefore unlike our task when construing` device' we are not required to examine the intrinsic_record for a clear and unmistakable disavowal of claim_scope when construing the` release means' limitation.7 limiting the scope of the` release means' limitation is analytically distinct from limiting the meaning of the term` device'
while had saffran chosen not to use a means-plus-function_limitation i might hesitate to limit the scope of the` release means' term the outcome i reach today flows from his drafting choice

while not controlling here we also note that the united states patent and trademark office` pto' arrived at a similar definition during an ex parte reexamination of the ¡¬760_patent reexamination control no._90 /009,795 limiting even its broadest reasonable interpretation of the` release means' limitation to require hydrolyzable_bonds
the pto ultimately confirmed the patentability of each reexamined claim in that proceeding
