mar._10,_1998 unocal_i
in their jmol_motion the atlantic richfield company and other appellant_refiners asserted that union oil company of californias unocal united_states patent no._5288,393393_patent is invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡±¡± 102_and_112_(1994)
the district_court also held that unocal did not commit inequitable_conduct before the u.s. patent and trademark office pto
see union_oil_co. of cal
v. atlantic_richfield_co. 34_f.supp.2d_1208 1222 c.d.cal.1998 unocal_ii
because the appellant_refiners did not show a reversible flaw in the jurys verdict this court affirms the district_courts denial of jmol on ¡±¡± 102_and_112 issues
similarly this court affirms the trial_courts discretionary judgment of no inequitable_conduct.1

i. unocal owns the393_patent which claims automotive_gasoline_compositions that reduce automobile_tailpipe_emissions
unocals original_patent_application contained 82 claims
as is often the case during the course of prosecution the inventor added and canceled many claims
ultimately 155 claims issued but unocal later disclaimed all but the forty-one at issue in this case claims 20 53 54 56 57 71-75 78 79 81 112-16 117 multiply dependent on claims 53 73 78 112 116 and 125 claim 120 multiply dependent on claims 55 78 79 and 124 claim 121 dependent on claim 120 and therefore multiply dependent on claims 55 78 79_or_124 125-27 133-35 137 153 and 155
each claim appears in dependent or multiple *992 dependent form and has from four to six limitations describing ranges for several of the fuel_characteristics
each claim effectively begins either with the preface` [ a ] n unleaded gasoline_fuel suitable for combustion in an automotive_engine' or` [ a ] n unleaded gasoline_fuel suitable for combustion in a spark_ignition_automotive_engine'
as an example claim 117 as dependent upon claim 116 states:2

117
[ an unleaded gasoline_fuel suitable for combustion in an automotive_engine said fuel having a reid vapor pressure no greater than 7.0 psi and a 50 %_d-86_distillation_point no greater than 200¢X_f. and a 90 %_d-86_distillation_point no greater than 300¢X_f. and a paraffin_content greater than 85 volume_percent and an olefin_content less than 4 volume_percent ] wherein the maximum 10 % distillation point is 158¢X_f 70¢X c.
'393_patent col._24,_ll._24-27
as illustrated above the claims do not describe each gasoline_product in terms of molecular structures or lists of ingredients
instead the claims specify the chemical_properties of the gasolines reflecting the way oil_refiners formulate gasoline
when oil_refiners formulate new gasoline_products they do so by mixing petroleum stocks
different stocks have different properties that are known to oil_refiners
the record shows that oil_refiners of ordinary_skill in the art change the chemical_properties of gasoline by varying the proportions of different petroleum stocks
thus the claims which define the invention in terms of various_characteristics also inform those of skill in the art of the composition of the claimed gasoline_fuels

unocal researched extensively the production of automotive_gasoline with reduced combustion emissions
unocals scientists drs
jessup and croudace ultimately filed a patent_application based on their findings
their research taught ways to produce cleaner gasoline by varying the following chemical_properties in automotive_gasolines reid vapor pressure rvp t10 t50 t90 olefins paraffins aromatics,3 and octane

rvp measures the partial pressure of a gasoline_sample when heated to 100¢X_f in a sealed container
see id.at col._18,_ll._43-47
t10 t50 and t90 are abbreviations for percentage distillation points as measured according to an industry standard procedure called` d-86'
each corresponds to the temperatures at which a given percentage of the gasoline_sample enters a gaseous phase under specific experimental conditions
thus t10 is the 10 %_d-86_distillation_point ; tbig_token__50_the_50__big_token %_d-86_distillation_point ; and tbig_token__90_the_90__big_token %_d-86_distillation_point
the olefins value describes the percentage of the gasoline comprised of olefins measured by volume
olefins otherwise known as alkenes are open-chain_hydrocarbons that contain at least one double bond
the paraffins value describes the percentage of the gasoline comprised of paraffins measured by volume
paraffins otherwise known as alkanes are open-chain_hydrocarbons that contain only single bonds
the aromatics value describes the percentage of the gasoline comprised of aromatics measured by volume
aromatics are compounds whose properties resemble those of 6-carbon ring molecules that have an average of three intra-ring carbon-carbon double bonds i.e. benzene
octane as used in the393_patent describes the knocking or detonation characteristics of a gasoline_sample as compared with a reference fuel
the octane value is derived by testing gasoline in a special engine under specified experimental conditions and comparing those results to identically tested reference blends of isooctane and n-heptane

*993 drs
jessup and croudace sought to reduce the levels of carbon monoxide co nitrous oxide nox and hydrocarbons hc emitted from automobile tailpipes
after considerable experimentation drs
jessup and croudace discovered relationships between the various petroleum characteristics described above and tailpipe_emissions
drs
jessup and croudace then patented their innovative fuel_compositions describing the new compositions by their characteristics

the specification of the393_patent describes relationships among automotive_gasoline characteristics and fuel emissions including the following 1
decreasing rvp is of primary_importance and decreasing t10 and olefin_content are of secondary importance for reducing nox_emissions
see393_patent col._2,_ll._21-29
2
decreasing t50 is of primary_importance for reducing co and hc_emissions
see id.at ll
7-11
3
increasing paraffin_content and decreasing t50 are most effective for reducing co emissions
see id.at col._6,_ll._12-28
4
decreasing both olefin_content and rvp are most effective for reducing nox_emissions
see id.at ll
28-31
5
hc_emissions are most practically reduced by decreasing olefins and/or t50
see id.at ll
46-50
6
any combination of the eight characteristics can be increased or decreased as described and that the greater any individual characteristic is changed in the directions indicated the better the result
see id.at col._15,_ll._20-28
the specification also provides specific numerical ranges for each characteristic
for example the specification teaches 1
co and hc_emissions can be minimized by reducing tbig_token__50_below_215__big_token ¢X_f preferably below 195¢X_f. see id.at col._2,_ll._7-20
2
nox_emissions can be minimized by a decreasing rvp to 8.0 psi or less preferably below 7.0 psi ; b decreasing olefins below 15 % preferably to essentially zero ; or c decreasing tbig_token__10_below_140__big_token ¢X_f. see id.at ll
21-34
3
the best nox reductions are obtained when the olefins are below 15 % rvp is 7.5 psi or less and t10 is below 140¢X_f. see id.at ll
44-50
4
all three pollutants are reduced when tbig_token__50_is_215__big_token ¢X_f or less and rvp is 8.0 psi or less with greater_reductions when olefins are below 10 % or t10 is below 140¢X_f and still greater_reductions when both olefins and t10 are reduced
see id.at ll
54-64
5
further pollution reductions are possible when t50 is below 195¢X > f olefins are below 5 % preferably at essentially zero t10 is below 120¢X_f and/or when rvp is below 7.0 psi
see id.at l. 64-big_token__col._3 _l._3__big_token
elsewhere the specification describes the optimal_ranges for five of the eight fuel_characteristics in similar_terms

the specification also states that the gasolines are preferably unleaded have an octane rating of at least 90 and fall most preferably within one or more of five volatility classes in american society for testing and materials astm publication d4814-89 included in table 1 of the patent
see id.at col._4,_l._66- col. 5. l. 13
beyond the optimal_ranges for individual_characteristics the393_patent also discloses preferred fuel mixtures
in sum the393 disclosure describes with detail the benefits and methods of varying gasoline characteristics
the specification describes 1 the relationships among the eight individual_fuel_characteristics and co nox and hc_emissions 2 characteristics most important for emissions and 3 specific desirable ranges for rvp t10 t50 olefins paraffins and aromatics

*994 the appellant_refiners originally sued unocal in district_court seeking a declaratory_judgment to invalidate the393_patent
unocal counterclaimed alleging willful_infringement of the393_patent
the district_court then construed the claims of the393_patent effectively converting the refiners declaratory_judgment_action into an infringement_defense
then the district_court tried those invalidity issues to a jury
during forty-nine days of trial the jury heard the testimony of numerous witnesses and considered hundreds of exhibits and demonstrations
see unocal_i slip op.at 6
at the close of all evidence the district_court properly instructed the jury on the law and presented the jury with a special_verdict_form
the verdict_form required the jury to decide validity under ¡± 102 and ¡± 112 separately for each of the forty-one asserted claims
with respect to the ¡± 112 questions the trial_court asked the jury to consider the393_patents specification including the original_claims of the application as filed
see northern telecom inc. v. datapoint corp. 908_f.2d_931 938 15_uspq2d_1321 1326 fed.cir.1990` the original_claims as filed are part of the patent_specification`
in total the trial_courts special_verdict_form asked the jury 223 individual questions
after thirteen days of deliberation the jury returned and answered affirmatively that sufficient written description supported each of the forty-one asserted claims and that none was anticipated under ¡± 102

the appellant_refiners then moved the district_court to overturn the jurys verdict with a motion for jmol based on anticipation obviousness and lack of written description
after reviewing arguments of both parties and the record the district_court found that` substantial_evidence exists in the record regarding the written description to support the verdict that drs
jessup and croudace had possession of the claimed subject_matter'
unocal_i slip op.at 6
the district_court similarly considered and rejected appellant_refiners arguments on anticipation and obviousness
see id.at 3-5

the appellant_refiners also argued that the393_patent was unenforceable for inequitable_conduct
the district_court tried that issue itself and held that the refiners did not meet their burden of showing inequitable_conduct by clear and convincing_evidence
see unocal_ii 34 f.supp.2d at 1222
the district_court found the case exceptional and therefore also awarded attorney_fees to unocal under 35 u.s.c.¡± 285 1994

the appellant_refiners now appeal the district_courts denial of jmol on anticipation and written description
they also appeal the district_courts inequitable_conduct decision

ii
this court reviews the district_courts jmol ruling after a jury verdict by reapplying the district_courts own standard
see applied med resources corp. v. united_states surgical corp. 147_f.3d_1374 1376 47_uspq2d_1289 1290 fed.cir.1998
thus to prevail on appeal the appellant_refiners must show that substantial_evidence does not support the jurys factual_findings or that the district_court erred in applying the law
see id

a district_court may overturn a jurys verdict on a motion for jmol only if upon the record before the jury reasonable persons could not reach the verdict returned by that jury
see perkin-elmer corp. v. computervision corp. 732_f.2d_888 893 221_uspq_669 673 fed.cir.1984
this court must consider the evidence of record in the light most favorable to unocal drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor without disturbing the jurys credibility determinations or substituting this courts resolutions of conflicting evidence for those of the jury
see applied med. 147 f.3d at 1376-77

a
this court requires that a party seeking to invalidate a patent under ¡± 102 *995 show that the allegedly invalidating prior_art contains` each and every element of [ the ] claimed invention'
lewmar marine inc. v. barient inc. 827_f.2d_744 747 3_uspq2d_1766 1767 fed.cir.1987
to prevail on anticipation at trial the refiners had to prove their case by clear and convincing_evidence
see verdegaal bros. v. union_oil_co. 814_f.2d_628 631 2_uspq2d_1051 1052-53 fed.cir.1987
the law imposes this high burden because unocals patent like any issued patent enjoys a presumption of validity
see id

this court reviews a finding of anticipation as a question of fact
see in re graves 69_f.3d_1147 1151 36_uspq2d_1697 1700 fed.cir.1995
therefore on appeal this court must affirm the district_courts denial of jmol on anticipation if substantial_evidence supports the jurys verdict that the cited prior_art did not anticipate the claims

`` the first step in any invalidity.. analysis is claim_construction'
see rockwell int l corp. v. united_states 147_f.3d_1358 1362 47_uspq2d_1027 1029 fed.cir.1998
claim construction is a question of law which this court reviews without deference
see georgia-pacific corp. v. united_states gypsum co. 195_f.3d_1322 1330 52_uspq2d_1590 1597 fed.cir.1999
`` in claim_construction the words of the claims are construed independent of the accused product in light of the specification the prosecution_history and the prior_art.. [ t ] he construction of claims is simply a way of elaborating the normally terse claim_language [ ] in order to understand and explain but not to change the scope of the claims'
scripps clinic v. genentech inc. 927_f.2d_1565 1580 18_uspq2d_1001 1013 fed.cir.1991 internal_quotation_marks omitted

the claims of the393_patent recite either` [ a ] n unleaded gasoline suitable for combustion in an automotive_engine' or` [ a ] n unleaded gasoline_fuel suitable for combustion in a spark_ignition_automotive_engine'
thus the393_patent_claims compositions of matter
the scope of these composition_claims can not as the appellant_refiners argue embrace only certain_uses of that composition
see in re spada 911_f.2d_705 708 15_uspq2d_1655 1657 fed.cir.1990
otherwise these composition_claims would mutate into method claims
the district_court correctly applied this principle refusing to narrow the scope of the claimed compositions to specific uses

the district_court read each claim in light of the specification and concluded that the claims cover` fuels that will regularly be used in autos not that conceivably could be'
union_oil_co. of cal
v. atlantic_richfield_co. no
cv-95-2379-kmw slip op.at 7 c.d.cal
may_19,_1997 unocal_iii
the district_court thus construed the claims to cover only a narrow class of fuel_compositions namely only standard automotive_gasoline
the district_court correctly excluded from claim scope a broader class of petroleum formulations such as aviation fuels or racing_fuels
the claim_language confirms the district_courts reading of the claims to cover mass market automotive_gasoline
the claim_language specifies fuels for an` automotive_engine' not an aviation engine
see e.g.393_patent col._18,_l._65
moreover the explicit reference to` unleaded gasoline' again invokes standard automotive fuels rather than specialized fuels
see e.g. id.at col._18,_l._64

the district_courts interpretation also finds extensive support in the specification
the patentees described the problem that their invention addressed one of the major environmental problems confronting the united_states and other countries is atmospheric pollution i.e.` smog' caused by the emission of gaseous pollutants in the exhaust gases from automobiles
this problem is especially acute in major metropolitan areas such as los angeles calif. where the atmospheric conditions and the great number of automobiles account for aggravated air pollution
*996 id.at col._1,_ll._9-16
similarly the patentees describe their testing procedures and results in the specification
specifically the patentees used ordinary passenger automobiles in their tests
the393_patent records the results of testing certain fuels in a 1989 oldsmobile calais a 1988_oldsmobile_98 a 1985 ford tempo a 1990 lincoln a 1984 chevrolet caprice a 1988 honda accord a 1989 ford taurus a 1990 plymouth shadow a 1985 chevrolet suburban and a 1990 toyota camry
see id.at fig._9
none of these are aviation or racing vehicles

similarly another passage provides context for the trial_courts claim_construction
the patentees describe their choice of test vehicles as follows a total of 22 different unleaded gasoline_fuels was tested in a 1988 oldsmobile regency 98 automobile equipped with a 3800 cc v-6 engine
this automobile was selected because it represented a high sales volume product with close to the current state-of-the-art emission technology
id.at col._7,_ll._61-6
the patentees tailored their research and their patent to ordinary fuels for use in standard passenger cars
thus the claim_language further informed by the specification shows that the district_court correctly read the claims to cover ordinary automotive fuel

because the393_patent covers only standard automotive fuel the district_court correctly determined that specialty fuels within other limitations of the claims do not anticipate under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102
in other_words the aviation and racing_fuels that allegedly invalidate the393 claims do not anticipate because they do not contain each and every limitation of the claims
see verdegaal 814 f.2d at 631
specifically this alleged prior_art does not include the limitation of being a standard automotive fuel composition

moreover the record does not show that the aviation and racing_fuels otherwise have the claimed characteristics of the particular standard automotive fuels recited in the393_patent
while the record shows that some properties of the aviation and racing_fuels coincide with the properties of the393_patents claims the record does not show the presence of each and every limitation
an expert for the refiner appellants stated that the allegedly anticipatory phillips b-35 racing fuel` is very different from typical [ automotive fuel ]'
tr.at 4782
when asked` is unocal unleaded racing gasoline very different from typical_motor_gasoline ?
`` the expert again answered` yes'
id.at 5047
this expert similarly answered` yes' when questioned about whether the asserted aviation fuels were` very different' from typical_motor_gasoline
see id.at 5060

the district_court did not err in construing the claims of the393_patent
furthermore the record does not show each and every element of the asserted claims of the393_patent present in any single prior_art reference
therefore this court affirms the district_courts denial of jmol on anticipation

b
the first paragraph of ¡± 112 states that` the specification shall contain a written description of the invention and of the manner and process of making and using it in such full clear concise and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains or with which it is most nearly connected to make and use the same'
35 u.s.c.¡± 112
in written description_cases` [ t ] he primary consideration is factual and depends on the nature of the invention and the amount of knowledge imparted to those skilled in the art by the disclosure'
in re wertheim 541_f.2d_257 262 191_uspq_90 96 ccpa 1976 emphasis added
this court reviews a jurys factual_findings for substantial_evidence
see b. braun med. inc. v. abbott labs. 124_f.3d_1419 1423 43_uspq2d_1896 1899 fed.cir.1997

*997 the written description_requirement does not require the applicant` to describe exactly the subject_matter claimed [ instead ] the description must clearly allow persons of ordinary_skill in the art to recognize that [ he or she ] invented what is claimed'
in re gosteli 872_f.2d_1008 1012 10_uspq2d_1614 1618 fed.cir.1989 citations omitted
thus ¡± 112 ?
1 ensures that as of the filing date the inventor conveyed with reasonable clarity to those of skill in the art that he was in possession of the subject_matter of the claims
see vas-cath inc. v. mahurkar 935_f.2d_1555 1563-64 19_uspq2d_1111 1117 fed.cir.1991

in the course of the lengthy jury trial the district_court heeded this courts counsel to use special verdicts in complex cases
see comark communications inc. v. harris corp. 156_f.3d_1182 1189_n._1 48_uspq2d_1001 1006_n._1_(fed.cir.1998)
the district_court presented the jury with a verdict_form asking it to decide separately whether each of the claims met the written description_requirement
following these instructions the jury returned its verdict answering affirmatively forty-one separate times that sufficient written description supported each of the asserted claims

after the jurys verdict the appellant_refiners renewed their motion for jmol to overturn the jurys verdict
see fed.r.civ.p
50 b
the district judge then reconsidered the patent_documents independently in light of all the evidence and denied the jmol_motion thus upholding the jurys verdicts
like the district_court this court must accord deference to the jury findings on written description
this court will not substitute its judgment for that of the fact finder
see general electro music corp. v. samick music corp. 19_f.3d_1405 1412 30_uspq2d_1149 1155 fed.cir.1994

on the record in this appeal substantial_evidence amply supports the jurys findings and the trial_judges jmol ruling
the393_patent teaches the effects of varying the properties of automotive_gasolines to reduce harmful tailpipe_emissions
in the art of gasoline_production skilled_refiners obtain raw petroleum products and mix them together to achieve a desired product
each product is the mixture of many chemicals in varying proportions
the393_patent teaches that changes in the proportions of different hydrocarbon-containing streams mixed to produce gasoline with specific properties reduces the amount of nox co and hydrocarbons emitted from an automobile engine
varying one or more properties in turn affects other properties of a gasoline_product
therefore the patent_claims its inventive products in terms of ranges of chemical_properties which work in combination with ranges of other chemical_properties to produce a gasoline that reduces emissions

appellant_refiners assert that the specification does not describe the exact chemical component of each combination that falls within the range claims of the393_patent
however neither the patent_act nor the case_law of this court requires such detailed disclosure
see in re hayes microcomputer prods. inc. 982_f.2d_1527 1533 25_uspq2d_1241 1245` [ the applicant ] does not have to describe exactly the subject_matter claimed
`` ; vas-cath 935 f.2d at 1566` ranges found in applicants claims need not correspond exactly to those disclosed in [ the specification ] ; issue is whether one skilled in the art could derive the claimed ranges from the [ ] disclosure`
rather the patent_act and this courts case_law require only sufficient description to show one of skill in the refining art that the inventor possessed the claimed invention at the time of filing

drs
jessup and croudace described their invention in terms of ranges
that form of description does not offend ¡± 112 ?
1
in fact this invention lends itself to description in terms of ranges and variance of those ranges to achieve particular properties of the gasoline_products
the inquiry for adequate written description *998 simply does not depend on a particular claim format but rather on whether the patents description would show those of ordinary_skill in the petroleum refining art that the inventors possessed the claimed invention at the time of filing

in this case the patent teaches one of ordinary_skill that reducing t50 progressively reduces co and hydrocarbons ; reducing olefins progressively reduces nox and hydrocarbons ; increasing paraffins progressively reduces co and nox ; and so forth with several other relationships
then the patent_claims ranges for these properties that provide cleaner gasoline emissions
the background and abstract portions of the specification discuss thoroughly the claimed ranges and the combinations of multiple properties

for example the written description supporting a single claim - claim 117-follows:4

?
the specification further guides the skilled artisan in combining the above properties` it will also follow that one can increase or decrease any combination of the eight properties listed above i.e. at least two at least three at least four etc. of the properties can be increased or decreased in the direction indicated above as well as all eight'
'393_patent col._15,_ll._20-25
the record of the trial contains testimony and exhibits showing in similar_terms the written description and support for each of the forty-one claims

to reiterate this court supplies the written description supporting another claim claim 125 as follows

*999. ?
beyond this evidence from the patent itself skilled_refiners testified that the specification taught them that the inventor possessed the emission-reducing gasolines at the time of filing
for example when questioned richard stellman an expert in the field stated q does the patent teach one of ordinary_skill in the art such as yourself to alter two or more of the properties in a particular - in the prescribed fashion in order to affect all three of the criteria pollutants ?
a yes it does
q and does the patent set forth values from which one of ordinary_skill in the art can practice the invention ?
a yes it does
tr.at 2515

the patent unmistakably informs skilled_refiners to increase or decrease the various_components to arrive at preferred combinations
in fact the written description usually labels both preferred and most preferred levels within each range
skilled refiners testified that they knew the composition of the claimed combinations based on this written description
contrary to appellant_refiners arguments to this court the record shows that refiners of ordinary_skill understood and applied the393_patents teachings
in sum the record shows that the inventors possessed the claimed invention at the time of filing in the assessment of those of ordinary_skill in the petroleum refining art.5 moreover the jury in this case reached the same conclusion as a matter of fact-a proposition that this court can not disturb on this record which supplies substantial_evidence to support that finding

the appellant_refiners attempt to rescue their written description argument by focusing on the t90_levels cited in claims 74 81 116 117 and 127
appellant_refiners allege that the` specification provides no specific t90 values.. [ and that a ] lthough five of the original_application claims recited combinations including a t90 limitation they bear no resemblance to the remaining claims with t90_limitations'
appellants br.at 46
appellant_refiners misapprehend the teachings of t90_levels
the *1000393_patent teaches that lowering the t90 distillation point below prior_art standards for automotive_gasolines creates the desired effect
see393_patent col._2,_l._1
the standards set forth in table 1 of the393_patent describe the astm_standards for gasolines that have t90_distillation_points between 365_and_374 ¢X_f. the t90_distillation_points in the originally filed claims were less than or equal to either 315_or_300 ¢X_f thus substantially lower than in the prior_art gasolines
the claimed ranges of the originally filed claims are the same as those set forth in the six claims of the issued393_patent that contain t90_limitations
in other_words the disclosure at the time of filing taught one of skill in the art that the inventors possessed the subject_matter of the later claims
even if appellant_refiners argument were correct that analysis only addresses the validity of five claims leaving the remaining thirty-six claims

appellant_refiners argue that in re ruschig 54_c.c.p.a._1551 379_f.2d_990 154_uspq_118_(ccpa_1967) supports their argument
this courts predecessor discussed in ruschig whether a claim for a particular pharmaceutical compound copied into a patent_application for the purposes of provoking an interference was adequately supported by the written description of a class of compounds
ruschig is different than this case for several reasons
first the ruschig case involved a copied claim another inventors claim copied into ruschigs application which did not find support in ruschigs application because ruschig had invented and disclosed a broad set of the compounds that was similar but not entirely within the scope of the claim
because another inventor not ruschig drafted the claim at issue to fit another specification it is not surprising that the disputed claim did not find support in ruschigs specification even though the inventions were similar
in this case however the claims although amended in the course of prosecution were drawn to the inventions of jessup and croudace who drafted the claims with support from their own specification

second as this courts predecessor explained in distinguishing ruschig in another case involving ranges if lack of literal support alone were enough to support a rejection under ¡± 112 then the statement of in re lukach.. that` the invention claimed does not have to be described in ipsis verbis in order to satisfy the description_requirement of ¡± 112' is empty verbiage
wertheim 541 f.2d at 265
as in this case in wertheim the asserted claims covered a range` solids level of at least 35 %' id.at 258 whereas the specification disclosed a broader range` concentrated.. until a concentration of 25_to_60 % solid matter is reached' id.at 262 internal_quotation_marks omitted
in wertheim the ccpa held that the specification supported the claimed range even though the precise range of the claim was not repeated verbatim in the specification as the dissent in this case would appear to require
in so holding the court cautioned that it would` let form triumph over substance' if it allowed the written description_requirement to eviscerate claims that are narrowed during prosecution simply because the patent applicant broadly disclosed in the original_patent_application but then narrowed his claims during prosecution
see id.at 263
additionally wertheim reiterates the often cited rule that written description questions are intensely factual and should be dealt with on a case-by-case_basis without the application of wooden rules
see id.at 262
thus wertheim fully supports the result in this case and limits the applicability of ruschig

our predecessor court in ruschig expressed concern over the extent to which the patentee relied on variables in describing structures leading that court to explain that rather than blaze_marks on trees the patentee had simply provided the public with a forest of trees
artisans skilled in petroleum refining in contrast *1001 are aware of the properties of raw petroleum sources and know how to mix streams of such sources to achieve a final product with desired characteristics
thus the patentee in this case taught the desired characteristics of the final automotive fuels realizing that those of skill in this art know that those characteristics define the claimed products

a closer case for assessing the facts of written description in these forty-one verdicts-one which dealt with ranges and combinations-is ralston_purina_co. v. far-mar-co inc. 772_f.2d_1570 1575 227_uspq_177 179 fed.cir.1985
in ralston a case in which this court applied the less deferential clear error standard appropriate for this courts review of bench verdicts this court noted that the ranges in applicants claims need not correspond exactly to those disclosed in the parent application
see id.at 1575
rather this court clarified that the issue is whether one of skill in the art could derive the claimed ranges from the parents disclosure
see id
; see also vas-cath 935 f.2d at 1566 holding that the district_court erred in` applying a legal standard that essentially required the drawings of the081 design application to necessarily exclude all diameters other than those within the claimed range`
because of the fact-sensitive nature of the written description inquiry this court has often warned against misapplication of precedents in this area
see vas-cath 935 f.2d at 1562 citing in re driscoll 562_f.2d_1245 1250 195_uspq_434 438 ccpa 1977
this case illustrates the reason for that warning
ralston governs this case

the written description_requirement does not require identical descriptions of claimed compounds but it requires enough disclosure in the patent to show one of skill in this art that the inventor` invented what is claimed'
vas-cath 935 f.2d at 1563
on this precise question the jury received many days of testimony heard from skilled_refiners reviewed graphs and claim charts and examined the patent_documents as guided by those skilled in the art
indeed the district_court which also heard all the evidence from those of skill in the art stated` [ t ] he court finds that substantial_evidence exists in the record regarding written description to support the verdict that drs
jessup and croudace had possession of the claimed subject_matter'
unocal_i slip op.at 6
this court agrees
because the record shows substantial_evidence of adequate written description for each claim as the jury found this court affirms

iii
applicants for u.s. patents and their representatives before the pto are subject to a duty of candor good_faith and honesty in their prosecution of patent_applications
see 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 1999
`` a breach of this duty constitutes inequitable_conduct'
molins plc v. textron inc. 48_f.3d_1172 1178 33_uspq2d_1823 1826 fed.cir.1995
if a court determines that a patentee has engaged in inequitable_conduct the court must consider whether as a matter of equity the patent should be deemed unenforceable
see labounty mfg. inc. v. itc 958_f.2d_1066 1070 22_uspq2d_1025 1028 fed.cir.1992
because as the name suggests inequitable_conduct is an equitable issue this court reviews such determinations for an abuse of discretion
see kingsdown med consultants ltd. v. hollister inc. 863_f.2d_867 876 9_uspq2d_1384 1392 fed.cir.1988 en banc in relevant part
moreover this court will not disturb the district_courts factual determinations of materiality and intent without a` definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed'
id

in this case the district_court issued a thorough and well reasoned opinion that shows consideration of the fundamental issues of inequitable_conduct
specifically the district_court noted that the allegedly withheld test data would not have been material to the patentability of the claims
*1002 see molins 48 f.3d at 1179
the district_court also found no intent to deceive by withholding the disputed test records but instead determined that unocal acted in good_faith during the prosecution
this court detects no clear error in these findings and no abuse of discretion in the district_courts determination of no inequitable_conduct

iv
because the record contains substantial_evidence to support the jurys verdicts of no anticipation and sufficient written description this court affirms the district_courts denial of jmol
similarly this court affirms the district_courts inequitable_conduct determination

costs
each party shall bear its own costs

affirmed

lourie circuit_judge dissenting in part
because the jurys verdict that the claims are not invalid for lack of written description is not supported by substantial_evidence i would reverse the district_courts denial of the motion for jmol hold the relevant claims to be invalid and vacate the damages and attorney_fees awarded to unocal
because the district_court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that unocal did not engage in inequitable_conduct i would affirm that decision
i would not reach the anticipation issue

unocals393_patent is directed to specific gasoline compositions albeit compositions defined by ranges of properties
no matter how an invention is claimed it must be described in the specification
the claimed compositions were not so described
the majority supports its affirmance of the denial of the jmol using enablement reasoning
it points to the numerous_references in the specification to teachings of the various ways one may obtain particular combinations of properties for the fuels
these are general_descriptions of how to make fuel_compositions not descriptions of the claimed compositions
they may also constitute descriptions of processes for obtaining various_characteristics of fuel_compositions but it is specific_compositions that are claimed here not processes
there are written descriptions of other particular compositions in the specification but they are not written descriptions of the inventions claimed here
it is in fact undisputed that the specification discloses no distinct embodiments corresponding to any claim at issue

the majority supports its decision in part with two charts purporting to show detailed support in the specification for claims 117_and_125
however the description that the majority provides with commendable thoroughness shows the weakness of its conclusion
the claimed compositions do not appear in the specification as such
the charts were synthesized by pulling together various directions in the specification in order to constitute the claimed compositions
note the references to different parts of the specification for the various_components
the patent does not contain such complete descriptions of those compositions ; they were presumably prepared after the grant of the patent for purposes of litigation by unocal
erroneously they were accepted by the jury the trial_judge and the appellate majority

unocals original_application contained 82 claims
during the course of prosecution 161 claims were added and 47 canceled
ultimately 196 claims issued but unocal later disclaimed all but the 41 at issue in this case
none of these claims were in the original_application ; all were added by amendment

the written description_requirement ensures that at the time a patent_application is filed the inventor has possession of the invention claimed
see vas-cath v. mahurkar *1003 935_f.2d_1555 1563 19_uspq2d_1111 1116 fed.cir.1991
it also serves the obvious purpose of telling the public what it is that has been invented
possession of the invention at the time of filing is best shown by a precise description in the text of the patent_specification of all of the aspects of the claimed invention
it is well-established that each claim in a patent constitutes a separate invention see e.g. jones v. hardy 727_f.2d_1524 1528 220_uspq_1021 1024 fed.cir.1984 ; thus a written description of the invention of each claim as such must be provided if the statutory requirement is to be met as to that claim

it is true that a patent need not describe the claimed subject_matter in precisely the same_terms as used in the claims see vas-cath 935 f.2d at 1563-64 19 uspq2d at 1116 ; however it must still describe the invention with all its claimed limitations in some manner see lockwood v. american airlines inc. 107_f.3d_1565 1572 41_uspq2d_1961 1966 fed.cir.1997 ; in re wertheim 541_f.2d_257 262 191_uspq_90 96 ccpa 1979
`` precisely how close the original description must come to comply with ¡± 112 must be left to case-by-case development'
vas-cath 935 f.2d at 1561 19 uspq2d at 1116 citing in re smith 59_c.c.p.a._1025 458_f.2d_1389 1395 173_uspq_679 683 ccpa 1972

it is clear beyond peradventure that there is no written description of any of the claimed compositions as such
there surely is a description of most of the particular claim_limitations of the various claims but that is not the same as a description of a specific composition described by a particular selection of those characteristics
if the written description does not use precisely the same_terms used in a claim the question then is whether the specification directs or guides one skilled in the art to the subject_matter claimed
see e.g. fujikawa v. wattanasin 93_f.3d_1559 1570 39_uspq2d_1895 1904 fed.cir.1996
one of our predecessor_courts analogized the requirement that the written description direct one to the claimed subject_matter to` blaze_marks' on specific trees that mark a trail through a forest
see in re ruschig 54_c.c.p.a._1551 379_f.2d_990 994-95 154_uspq_118 122 ccpa 1967
it found that a broad generic disclosure failed to constitute a description of a specific claimed compound
we have subsequently stated that without such specific direction a general disclosure will not be sufficient to support narrowly claimed subject_matter
see fujikawa 93 f.3d at 1571 39 uspq2d at 1905` in the absence of [ ] blazemarks [ that the claimed compounds were of special interest ] simply describing a large genus of compounds is not sufficient to satisfy the written description_requirement as to particular species or subgenuses`
that direction must be expressed in` full clear concise and exact' language
see fields v. conover 58_c.c.p.a._1366 443_f.2d_1386 1391 170_uspq_276 280 ccpa 1971 ; in re ahlbrecht 58_c.c.p.a._848 435_f.2d_908 911 168_uspq_293 296 ccpa 1971 ; ruschig 379 f.2d at 996 154 uspq at 123

each of the claims at issue here recites a fuel having a specific combination of different fuel_characteristics
although the specification separately describes most of the individual_characteristics of the combinations it is undisputed that none of the claims at issue is matched in the specification by the combination of characteristics required by that claim
a reasonable_juror could not find that the application shows possession of those combinations of characteristics by blazing a clear trail to them

unocal points to descriptions of individual_fuel_characteristics at column 14 of the specification as well as to the prosecution_history
however column 14 simply outlines the range of variation of t10 and t50 olefin_content and rvp in order to obtain emission reductions
this is an enablement disclosure not a description of particularly claimed compositions
describing these individual_fuel_characteristics in broad terms is not the same as describing *1004 an invention reciting specific_combinations of fuel_characteristics
the question is not whether each of the claim_limitations finds support in the specification but whether the inventions claimed fuels having specific_combinations of characteristics finds such support
the simple direction to adjust more than one fuel characteristic at a time does not direct one to and thus does not show possession of any of the claimed combinations of fuel_characteristics
one must pick and choose among eight different types of fuel_characteristics broadly described in order to arrive at any of the claimed combinations

for example as indicated earlier to arrive at one of the combinations described in claim 117 unocal had to pick through the specification to find the claimed limitations
four of the limitations-the t50 rvp olefin and paraffin limitations-fell within ranges broadly described but there is no direction to a composition having all of these limitations in the particular ranges claimed
furthermore no specific t90 ranges are described anywhere in the specification except in table 1 which recites only certain general astm_standards
unocal had to point to an original canceled claim to support the t90 value chosen but that characteristic was part of a composition no longer claimed and no longer part of the specification
lastly the specification repeatedly describes fuels with a t10 less than 140¢X_f but the claim recites a fuel with a maximum tbig_token__10_of_158__big_token ¢X_f. the specifications only recitation of a fuel with a tbig_token__10_of_158__big_token ¢X_f is one of the astm_standards in table 1 not a part of a described embodiment of the invention
by picking and choosing one can thus find all of the limitations but the specification gives no direction let alone the` full clear concise and exact' direction required to the claimed combination
the same picking and choosing is required to arrive at all of the claims asserted
when one has to pick and choose among a wide range of variables to construct a claim the subject_matter of that claim has not been described as required by the statute ; possession has not been demonstrated

unocal makes numerous_references to what the specification teaches
it does so by referring to general_descriptions of the possible variables
the specification does in fact contain a written description of methods for lowering auto emissions
it also teaches how to make various types of compositions and methods but does not contain a written description of the specifically claimed compositions
it is well settled that the enablement_requirement is separate and distinct from the written description_requirement of ¡± 112 ?
1 see vas-cath 935 f.2d at 1563 19 uspq2d at 1117 and that a specification may enable one skilled in the art to make and use an invention and yet still not describe it see id.at 1562 935_f.2d_1555 19 uspq2d at 1115
whether the specification fulfills the enablement_requirement by teaching how to make the claimed combinations is not before us ; the fact remains that it does not describe any one of the claimed compositions
in fact the extensive recitation of differing ranges and preferences for particular characteristics is in stark contrast to the lack of any specific_description of a composition particularly a composition set forth in the current claims

unocals reference to the broad ranges of the characteristics of the various gasolines also may be an adequate written description of a generic group of gasolines defined broadly by those characteristics
however such a generic claim is not before us
we only have claims defining compositions by a specific set of claim_limitations none of which compositions finds a specific_description in the patent_specification
in ruschig the court of customs and patent appeals held that a general formula containing variables that each include a number of possible groups does not describe each composition within its scope
the court stated that` [ s ] pecific claims to single compounds require reasonably specific supporting disclosure..' *1005 ruschig 379 f.2d at 994 154 uspq at 122
the same applies to the specific_compositions here
the court in ruschig found certain alleged` guides' in the specification inadequate stating that` we are looking for blaze_marks which single out particular trees
we see none'
id.at 995 54_c.c.p.a._1551 379_f.2d_990 154 uspq at 122
the court distinguished the written description_requirement from enablement which it considered might have been satisfied by the specification
see id
ruschig is directly pertinent to the present case and the fact that unocals patent_claims multiple species of compositions in no way lessens the force of ruschig as relevant precedent here
each of the claims in the393_patent suffers from the same defect

attempting to distinguish ruschig the majority asserts that this is a ralston purina case but the ralston purina opinion itself states that written description_cases must be decided on a case-by-case_basis
see ralston_purina_co. v. far-mar-co inc. 772_f.2d_1570 1575 227_uspq_177 179 fed.cir.1985
in finding satisfaction of that requirement it distinguishes a number of cases in which the requirement was not met` due to a number of different factors'
see id
the case-by-case analysis advocated in ralston purina leads in this case to the reality that the requirement has not been satisfied

i recognize that this is a jury trial and that the written description_requirement is a question of fact concerning which we owe considerable deference
however jury_verdicts are not irreversible if substantial_evidence is lacking
substantial_evidence is that minimum quantum of evidence from which a reasonable_jury might afford relief
see anderson v. liberty lobby inc. 477_u.s._242 249-50 106_s.ct._2505 91_l.ed.2d_202_(1986) holding that` merely colorable' or` not significantly probative' evidence is insufficient to meet the substantial_evidence standard ; consolidated edison co. v. nlrb 305_u.s._197 229 59_s.ct._206 83_l.ed._126_(1938)` substantial_evidence is more than a mere scintilla
it means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion`
if a reasonable_jury could not have found the facts necessary to support a verdict the trial_judge or reviewing court should reverse

this is a highly complicated case involving a patent that is difficult to fathom
one needs to analyze these claims the way one plans a trip with a road map in detail on paper
multiple claim dependencies and multiple claim_limitations make the task difficult
the complexity of the case is further increased by the way in which the patent_application was prosecuted with wholesale cancellation and addition of claims seemingly irrespective of whether their subject_matter was properly disclosed
it is easy to see how one could go astray

a reasonable_juror is one who has done his or her homework as described above in order to determine what each claim covers and where in the specification there is support for such claims
the result here speaks for itself
when such analysis is performed here it is plain that the claimed compositions are not described in the patent
no reasonable_jury carefully reading and examining the patent_specification could conclude otherwise i.e. that the patent_specifications descriptions of individual_fuel_characteristics or the teachings that multiple fuel_characteristics can be varied in particular ways constitutes a sufficient written description of the compositions of any of the claims
i therefore respectfully dissent from the conclusion of the majority that the claims have not been shown to be invalid

one of this courts predecessor_courts clarified that disclosure in an originally filed claim satisfies the written description_requirement

the dissent contends that the specification does not show that the inventors possessed the amended claims at the time of filing
in its arguments the dissent discounts the skill in this art which the jury found knows the composition of gasolines from the specifications description of characteristics
further the dissent discounts the jurys role in finding as a matter of fact that the inventor satisfied the written description_requirement preferring instead its own` findings' about the knowledge of skilled artisans and about the sufficiency of the disclosures
