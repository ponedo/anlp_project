i
a` bundle_breaker' is a machine used to separate stacked sheets of corrugated board
the ¡¬566_patent claims an improvement over the traditional bundle_breaker by providing` compliance_structures' which allow a bundle_breaker to simultaneously break multiple stacks of corrugated board logs of different_heights

the assembly line in corrugated board manufacturing plants typically includes a number of machines that prepare stacks of corrugated board or bundles

first a rotary die cutter scores a single sheet of corrugated board creating a series of` weakened lines' so that the board can be separated later into individual boxes
next a stacker collects multiple sheets and stacks them into a` log'
the stacker aligns the sheets weakened lines so that each log contains a series of` weakened_planes'
the bundle_breaker then separates a log into individual bundles by` breaking' the log along the weakened_planes
finally a load former puts the bundles onto pallets

the ¡¬566_patent filed on august 28 2002 and issued on december 2 2003 shows a bundle_breaker separating a log 4 into separate bundles 2_and_3

*1297. ?
a typical_bundle_breaker as essentially shown in this figure 14 has an upstream conveyor belt 10 and a downstream_conveyor belt 13 separated by a gap
when the weakened_plane 9 of a log straddles the gap or` breaking line' the conveyor_belts are stopped and independent clamps 16_and_17 are lowered to hold the log in position
the downstream_portion of the bundle_breaker then pivots about an axis 103 to break off a bundle
unlike the bundle_breaker shown above a typical_bundle_breaker might transfer the separated bundle off of the downstream_conveyor before advancing the remaining portion of the log to continue the breaking process
bundle breakers of this sort were well known in the art when the application for the ¡¬566_patent was filed
the ¡¬566_patent specification describes one prior_art bundle_breaker the pallmac_machine as one that would feed two or more_logs through its bundle_breaker side by side in order to speed production
as described in the ¡¬566_patent however this multiple-log approach came with problems
specifically if one or more of the side-by-side_logs were higher than the others due perhaps to a miscount in the number of sheets the rigid clamps used to hold the logs in position while breaking would exert a different amount of pressure on each log
the ¡¬566_patent describes the result of unequal pressure [ m ] ore pressure is exerted on the taller logs which can damage compressible material like corrugated cardboard
if the logs are not compressible then insufficient pressure is placed on the shorter logs and shifting of the logs can occur when the bundles are broken off from the log..
in the industry this problem is called alack of compliance problem ; i.e. the force on all the side by side_logs is not substantially equal
¡¬566_patent col.2 ll.16-31

the inventors of the ¡¬566_patent merrill martin and daniel talken came up with an improved clamp structure to solve the lack of compliance problem which they called a` compliance_structure'
an example of the inventors compliance_structure is shown most clearly in figure 20 of the patent

*1298. ?
the compliance_structure 20 includes a fluid-pressurized structure 21 that is connected to a plurality of rigid_members 46-55 -which the parties call` platens' -through a flexible_member 22
the ¡¬566_patent describes two identical compliance_structures on both the upstream and downstream clamps
when each clamp is lowered during operation the platens will contact the taller log 4 first
the fluid-pressurized structure will then deform the flexible_member and allow the clamp to continue to lower until the platens contact the shorter log 4
the fluid pressurized structure allows every platen that touches a log to exert an equal amount of pressure on that log regardless of its height

claim 1 of the ¡¬566_patent the only independent claim appears in jepson_form
in other_words the preamble describes prior_art bundle_breakers and then claims the compliance_structure mounted on each upper clamp as an improvement
see the manual of patent examining procedure` mpep' ¡± 2129 ?
iii 8th ed. rev.8 july 2010 explaining jepson claims
claim 1 recites emphasis added an improvement in a bundle_breaker for separating bundles from a log having a generally planar_top_surface said log including a plurality of sheets each having a generally planar_top_surface and each sheet is formed with at least one weakened line said weakened lines are vertically aligned in said log forming a weakened_plane in said log said bundle_breaker including a first_conveyor for conveying said log and having an upstream_end for receiving said log and a downstream_end and a second_conveyor having an upstream_end positioned immediately adjacent to said downstream_end of said first_conveyor providing a gap therebetween defining a bundle breaking plane said bundle_breaker including first_clamp means mounted for vertical_reciprocating_movement above said first_conveyor and second_clamp means mounted above said second_conveyor for vertical_reciprocating_movement in relation to said second_conveyor and said second_conveyor and said second_clamp means mounted for conjoint pivotal movement in relation to said bundle breaking plane for progressively breaking a bundle from said log along said weakened_plane in said log said improvement_comprising a. a first compliance_structure mounted on said first_clamp means including 1 a first fluid pressurized structure having a first flexible_member presenting a first engagement area for operative_engagement with an upstream portion of said generally planar_top_surface of said log and on the upstream side of said weakened_plane in said log ; and
b. a second compliance_structure mounted on said second_clamp means including 1 a second fluid pressurized structure having a second flexible_member presenting a second engagement area for operative_engagement with a downstream_portion *1299 of said generally planar_top_surface of said log and on the downstream side of said weakened_plane in said log

the dependent claims add various limitations that are in accordance with the description provided above
for example claim 2 requires that each conveyor have` a width sufficient to simultaneously transfer and support a plurality of logs in side by side_relation'
claim 3 further requires that the fluid pressurized structures engage the plurality of logs where` at least one log [ has ] a height greater than at least one other log'
claim 4 requires the flexible_members to extend` substantially the width of said logs' in the proximity of the weakened_plane
claim 7 requires each flexible_member to have a plurality of` closely spaced rigid_members.. for engaging said logs'
claim 13 claims an indexing capability which means that the downstream_conveyor can` receive and hold at least two bundles broken successively' before discharging them from the conveyor
and claim 14 adds the same indexing improvement to a bundle_breaker capable of breaking two or more_logs simultaneously meaning that the downstream_conveyor is able` to receive and hold at least two or more rows of bundles broken successively from a plurality of logs in side by side_relation'

plaintiff the martin family trust the` trust' is the assignee of the ¡¬566_patent
plaintiff george m._martin_co.` martin' sells the quik-break nicked bundle separator the` quik-break' which incorporates the invention claimed in the ¡¬566_patent
martin began offering the quik-break for sale in 2002 and has sold approximately 60 bundle_breakers

martin has been in the stacker business for a great deal longer than the bundle breaking business-since 1960-and has sold nearly 2,900 stackers in north america alone
in all martin has about 90 percent of the stacker_market

defendant alliance_machine systems international llc` alliance' is martins main competitor in the market for bundle_breakers that break multiple_bundles having uneven_heights
alliance typically sells between 10-15 bundle_breakers per year

the trust and martin sued alliance in february of 2007 alleging that alliances bundle_breaker infringed the ¡¬566_patent
as a part of its defense alliance alleged that martin lacked standing to sue because martin did not have a sufficient license to the ¡¬566_patent
although the trusts and martins interests are aligned as to liability alliance sought to dismiss martin because plaintiffs only sought damages based on martins lost profits as opposed to damages based on a reasonable royalty for the ¡¬566_patent
the district_court held a bench trial solely on the issue of standing ruling afterwards from the bench that martin had a` binding exclusive license [ to the ¡¬566_patent ] implied from the course of dealing between the trust and.. the company' and that therefore martin was` entitled to sue for lost profits in the case'

the district_court then held a two-week trial on invalidity infringement and damages
following four days of deliberation however the jury announced that it could not reach a unanimous verdict
in response each side filed renewed motions for judgment as a matter of law jmol on all issues
the district_court granted alliances jmol_motion on the issue of invalidity ruling that under the supreme_courts decision in ksr international co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007)` [ t ] he evidence on primary considerations and on *1300 secondary_considerations is so lop-sided in favor of obviousness that.. judgment [ must ] be entered as a matter of law in favor of [ alliance ]'
jmol_opinion 634 f.supp.2d at 1040
the court denied the remaining jmol_motions as moot
id

the trust and martin filed a timely notice of appeal arguing to this court among other things that the district_court erred in its validity_ruling
alliance cross appeals the district_courts determination that martin has standing to sue for lost_profit_damages
this court has jurisdiction under 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

this court reviews the grant of a jmol_motion without deference ericsson inc. v. harris corp. 352_f.3d_1369 1373 fed.cir.2003 applying the law of the regional circuit riverwood int l corp. v. r.a. jones & co. 324_f.3d_1346 1352 fed.cir.2003
`` a jurys inability to reach a verdict does not necessarily preclude a judgment as a matter of law'
headwaters forest defense v. county of humboldt 240_f.3d_1185 1197 9th cir.2000 vacated on other grounds 534_u.s._801 122_s.ct._24 151_l.ed.2d_1_(2001)
the test in the ninth circuit is` whether the evidence construed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party permits only one reasonable conclusion..' white v. ford motor co. 312_f.3d_998 1010 9th cir.2002 internal_quotation_marks omitted

under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a a patent is invalid` if the differences between the [ claimed ] subject_matter.. and the prior_art are such that the subject_matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary_skill in the art to which said subject_matter pertains'
whether a patent is invalid as obvious is ultimately a determination of law based on underlying determinations of fact
monarch knitting mach corp. v. sulzer morat gmbh 139_f.3d_877 881 fed.cir.1998
those underlying determinations of fact relate to` the scope and content of the prior_art the differences between the prior_art and the claimed invention the level of ordinary_skill in the art and any relevant secondary_considerations such as commercial_success long-felt need and the failure of others'
lucent techs. inc. v. gateway inc. 580_f.3d_1301 1310 fed.cir.2009 internal_quotation_marks omitted
thus this court will affirm a district_courts judgment on obviousness as a matter of law if` the content of the prior_art the scope of the patent claim and the level of ordinary_skill in the art are not in material dispute and the obviousness of the claim is apparent in light of these factors'
ksr 550 u.s. at 427 127_s.ct._1727

a
alliance asserts three bundle-breaking machines as prior_art the pallmac_machine the visy_machine and the tecasa_machine
this opinion will discuss the relevant attributes of each machine in turn

- the pallmac machine
a company called pallmac began shipping its first bundle_breaker in the united_states in 1995
originally the pallmac_machine featured springs and closely spaced wooden grippers or slats which would allow the machine to clamp simultaneously several logs with different_heights
a series of narrow` conveyor_ropes' positioned below the logs would move the logs through the machine
when the logs reached the breaking line the conveyor_ropes would stop and` rigid_members' would rise up from in between the conveyor_ropes in order to press the logs against the spring-cushioned slats

pallmac redesigned its bundle_breaker in 1998 by eliminating the springs and *1301 slats which required constant maintenance and replacing them with a fixed wooden plate
in order to allow for variation in log height pallmac modified the bottom_clamp so that the rigid_members rested on an elongated air_bag or` fire hose' that extended the entire width of the machine
in the modified pallmac_machine the rigid_members` float' along the top of the airbag
this later version of the pallmac_machine was first installed at a customer site in late 1998

the ¡¬566_patent itself describes pallmacs air_bag solution but describes the following problem with the` lifting' approach` as the lifting members lower the log [ after breaking ] a shifting of the individual sheets within the log can occur which changes the position of the weakened_plane and can result in failure to break the [ next ] bundle cleanly from the log or produce poorly formed bundles'
col.2 ll.50-55
the trust highlights this lifting approach as the primary difference between the pallmac_machine and the claimed invention
in other_words while the pallmac_machine clamped incoming logs with a compliance_structure from the bottom the claimed invention does so from the top

- the visy_machine
visy board` visy' is an australian corrugated board manufacturer
in july 1995 visy and a u.s. company thermoguard equipment inc.` tei' agreed that tei would provide visy with a bundle_breaker having a compliance_structure able` to accommodate up to a 1/2 [ inch ] height difference between multiple_bundles being broken simultaneously'
as early as october of 1996 tei sold a number of bundle_breakers to visy with an` air_bag clamping' feature
that feature included steel u-shaped grippers attached to the visy_machines upper clamping mechanism with air_bags located inside the grippers

the trust does not contest the district_courts description of how the visy_machine was supposed to work
according to the district_court flexible air tubing connected all of the air_bags so as to allow the air pressure to equalize and to apply the same downward force across all grippers
logs of uneven height would then come onto the conveyor_belts the grippers would lower and as the grippers engaged the logs air would be pushed in and out of the air_bags in proportion to the pressure on each so as to redistribute and more equalize the pressure
jmol_opinion 634 f.supp.2d at 1029
described as such the trust stipulated at trial that the visy_machine contains the` fluid-pressurized structure' and` flexible_member' limitations of independent claim 1

notwithstanding the theory behind the visy_machine however the trust argues that it would not have rendered the asserted claims obvious because it did not contain a working compliance_structure
the trust points to testimony from the on-site project engineer at visy mr._fankhauser who stated that the visy_machine was never able to consistently break multiple_bundles having uneven_heights and even that` the machine was allergic to breaking multiple logs'
thus mr._fankhauser testified that visy ultimately removed the air_bag clamping feature because it did not work i.e. it did not` commercially produce products.. at speeds that the factory was built to achieve'

the problems with the visy_machine were caused in part by the spacing of the grippers in the visy_machine
according to mr._fankhauser` pressure is just force divided by area so.. in a straightforward way.. if you reduce the area [ covered by the grippers ] you have to increase the pressure to attain a force'
*1302 because the grippers in the visy_machine covered a relatively small area on the surface of the logs mr._fankhauser testified that they needed to exert a large pressure in order to create enough force to hold the logs in place during breaking
this pressure tended to` bruise or damage the product' that the visy_machine was trying to break

- the tecasa machine
another competitor in the corrugated board industry independently made a machine called the tecasa bundle_breaker
at trial the parties stipulated that the tecasa_machine met every limitation of every asserted claim of the ¡¬ 566 patent and that it was first known in the united_states as of june 2002 almost three months before the filing date of the ¡¬566_patent
the trust attempted to swear behind the tecasa_machine at trial by arguing that it reduced its invention to practice before june 2002
specifically the trust presented evidence that messrs. martin and talken conceived of their invention in 1999 reduced it to practice in 2001 and offered it for sale in early 2002
the district_court assumed that the inventors of the ¡¬566_patent had reduced their claimed improvement to practice in time to eliminate the tecasa_machine as prior_art
nevertheless the district_court relied on the tecasa_machine as` plainly show [ ing ]simultaneous_invention as an indicia of obviousness'
jmol_opinion 634 f.supp.2d at 1036

b
the district_court correctly concluded as a matter of law that the differences between the prior_art and the claimed improvement were minimal
for instance the record contains a statement by the trusts expert dr. albert karvelis that there were only a discrete number of possible design options for choosing the location of the compliance_structure the top clamp the bottom_clamp or both clamps
this record evidence discredits the trusts argument that the difference between the bottom-up approach in the pallmac_machine and the top-down approach in the ¡¬566_patent creates a genuine issue of fact
bottom versus top is exactly the type of` finite number of identified predictable solutions' that justifies a legal conclusion that the result when expected is` the product not of innovation but of ordinary_skill and common sense'
ksr 550 u.s. at 421 127_s.ct._1727

the trust relies on the testimony of alliances own director of research and development that` from an engineering standpoint' one can not simply take the pallmac design and flip it from bottom to top
that testimony however is irrelevant to the obviousness_analysis
with one exception discussed below the claims themselves do not recite engineering details but merely require that the compliance_structures be mounted to clamps that are` above' the conveyor_belts
indeed alliances witness did testify that flipping the pallmac_machine was simple` from [ a ] concept point of view'
moreover to the extent that engineering obstacles did stand in the way to constructing a machine that used a top-down approach the visy_machine demonstrated that such obstacles could be overcome

as noted the trust attacks the visy_machine as prior_art alleging that the machine did not work for its intended_purpose
the district_court appropriately rejected that argument
under an obviousness_analysis a reference need not work to qualify as prior_art ;` it qualifies as prior_art regardless for whatever is disclosed therein'
amgen inc. v. hoechst marion roussel inc. 314_f.3d_1313 1357 fed.cir.2003
`` even if a reference discloses an inoperative device it is prior_art for all that it teaches'
beckman_instruments *1303 inc. v. lkb produkter ab 892_f.2d_1547 1551 fed.cir.1989

the trust concedes that the visy_machine teaches the` fluid pressurized structure' and` flexible_member' limitations ; the main dispute on appeal that the court can discern is whether visy teaches a` compliance_structure'
the record however definitively warrants the trial_courts conclusion that the visy_machine teaches a` compliance_structure'

the district_courts construction of` compliance_structure' which is not at issue on appeal is` a structure that deforms to allow a more uniform_distribution of force'
geo
m._martin_co. v. alliance_mach
sys
int l llc no._07-00692 2007_wl_4105832 *4 nov._16,_2007 emphasis added
inventor talken martins corporate representative at trial ran tests on a visy replica machine that showed that the visy_machine provided a distribution of force across logs of differing heights that was about 267 % more uniform than a visy_machine with immovable flat platens
thus the trusts own tests clearly and convincingly establish that the visy_machine contains a structure that` deforms to allow a more uniform_distribution of force'
in sum the visy_machine discloses a` compliance_structure'

the trust also appears to argue that because the claims are to an` improvement in a bundle_breaker' an accused infringer must show that any prior_art must contain an improvement over and above the improvement recited in the body of the claim
as applied to this case the trust argues that the prior_art must provide`reliable_breaking of multiple_bundles of uneven_heights while avoiding thelack of compliance problems found in the prior_art namely damage to the boards caused by excessive pressure and inconsistent breaking due to inadequate pressure'

this argument fails because it reads too much into the word` improvement'
although` the fact that the patentee has chosen the jepson_form of the claim evidences the intention to use the preamble to define in part the structural elements of his claimed invention' epcon gas sys. inc. v. bauer compressors inc. 279_f.3d_1022 1029 fed.cir.2002 internal_quotation_marks omitted the extent of the claimed` improvement' is defined only by the body of the claim
after all the transition of the claim contains the phrase` said improvement_comprising'
`` comprising' is a term of art that indicates that only what follows is essential
genentech inc. v. chiron corp. 112_f.3d_495 501 fed.cir.1997
thus if the patentee intended to claim an improvement that included a structure for` reliable_breaking' measured against some kind of commercial production standard it should have explicitly done so or argued on appeal for a construction of` compliance_structure' that contains such a standard
the record shows that the trust did neither

to be clear prior_art must teach a person of ordinary_skill to make an apparatus that works for its intended_purpose
beckman_instruments 892 f.2d at 1551
if the visy_machine did not do so on its own alliance would have needed to establish that a person of ordinary_skill would have nonetheless been able to make a working apparatus
in this case however the record shows that the visy_machine did work insofar as it was able to do what the preamble of claim 1 required namely` separate [ ] bundles from a log'
even mr._fankhauser testified that the visy_machine was able to break bundles without denting the top box of a stack if the bundles were` sufficiently small'
the visy_machine simply did not work at` production speed'
as discussed however the claims do not require a threshold throughput or commercial speed

*1304 the one design specification contained in the asserted claims can be found in the dependent claim 7 requirement that the platens be` closely spaced'
the district_court held that the` simple solution' of enlarging the surface area of the platens would have been apparent to one having ordinary_skill in the art based on the` fundamental and basic principle of physics' that force = pressure x area
jmol_opinion 634 f.supp.2d at 1037
this court again agrees with the district_court
the trust argues that if the solution were so simple someone at visy or alliance would have suggested it
the record only shows that visy and alliance employees tried to troubleshoot or repair the visy_machine not redesign it
thus their failure to suggest a redesign does not create a reasonable_dispute
indeed visys mr._fankhauser testified that the relationship between pressure and area was` straightforward'

finally on appeal the trust does not take issue with the district_courts invalidity holding on dependent claims 13_and_14 both of which relate to` indexing'
thus this court need not address those points

c. secondary considerations of non-obviousness must be considered when present
sud-chemie inc. v. multisorb techs. inc. 554_f.3d_1001 1008 fed.cir.2009
as the supreme_court recently reaffirmed` [ s ] uch secondary_considerations as commercial_success long felt but unsolved needs failure of others etc. might be utilized to give light to the circumstances surrounding the origin of the subject_matter sought to be patented
`` ksr 550 u.s. at 406 127_s.ct._1727 quoting graham v. john deere co. of kansas city 383_u.s._1 17-18 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966)
in some rare instances the secondary_consideration of simultaneous_invention might also supply` indicia ofobviousness
`` ecolochem inc. v. s. cal
edison co. 227_f.3d_1361 1376 fed.cir.2000 quoting graham 383 u.s. at 17-18 86_s.ct._684

here the trust argues that a number of secondary_considerations of non-obviousness preclude a conclusion that the asserted claims are obvious as a matter of law
the district_court held that the trusts secondary_considerations could not overcome` the fact that nearly every single person or entity who encountered the lack of compliance problems in the industry came up with the same general hydraulic design to manage it'
jmol_opinion 634 f.supp.2d at 1039
upon review this court agrees that the record shows the evidence of secondary_considerations in this case do not create a reasonable_dispute as to obviousness

the commercial_success of a product is relevant to the non-obviousness of a claim only insofar as the success of the product is due to the claimed invention
ormco corp. v. align tech. inc. 463_f.3d_1299 1312 fed.cir.2006
here alliance conclusively established that much of george martins commercial_success was due to martins pre-existing market_share in the stacker_market which according to martins president gave it a` huge advantage' in selling other products because it allowed martin to sell a` single-source system'
thus this factor carries little weight

evidence of a long-felt but unsolved need provides another secondary_consideration of non-obviousness
ecolochem 227 f.3d at 1376-77
where the differences between the prior_art and the claimed invention are as minimal as they are here however it can not be said that any long-felt need was unsolved
martin presented evidence that its quik-break worked better than any prior_art system because for example it could simultaneously *1305 break three bundles or more
the record shows however that this` need' had been met by prior_art machines such as the pallmac and the visy that could break more than one bundle at a time

the trusts evidence of failure of others is similarly insufficient
while a jury might have credited the trusts evidence that other machines such as the visy_machine did not work as well as the quik-break everything indicates that the quik-breaks superiority was due to its enhanced throughput over and above the claimed ability to handle a` plurality of logs'

industry praise must also be linked to the patented invention
power-one inc. v. artesyn techs. inc. 599_f.3d_1343 1352 fed.cir.2010
the only_evidence of industry_praise on which the trust reasonably relies-as opposed to self-serving statements by martins president that the patented feature offers` increased productivity and increased profitability' -is an internal alliance email in which an alliance employee reports a customers statement that` the martin breaker is the cats meow'
but that same email notes that the customer also chose the martin quik-break because` [ t ] he interface between the stacker and the breaker will be handled by a single vendor'
as with the commercial_success factor this reference to martins market_share in the stacker_market reduces the impact that this evidence could have in establishing industry_praise

finally the trust points to evidence that alliance copied the claimed invention namely alliances internal` bundle breaker action plan' wherein alliance analyzed the` geo martin concept' notes that the design is patented and then proposes adding its own` floating platens capability' to its bundle_breaker
this court has noted however` that a showing of copying is only equivocal evidence of non-obviousness in the absence of more compelling objective indicia of other secondary_considerations'
ecolochem 227 f.3d at 1380
the trusts evidence is hardly compelling here where the same internal memorandum suggested that alliances proposed design was the` same [ as the ] pallmac platen concept' but` flipped'
thus this evidence does not provide much help to the trust

independently made simultaneous_inventions made` within a comparatively short_space of time' are persuasive evidence that the claimed apparatus` was the product only of ordinary mechanical or engineering skill'
concrete appliances co. v. gomery 269_u.s._177 184 46_s.ct._42 70_l.ed._222_(1925)
but see lindemann maschinenfabrik gmbh v. am
hoist & derrick co. 730_f.2d_1452 1460 fed.cir.1984` because the statute 35 u.s.c.¡± 135 establishing and governing interference practice recognizes the possibility of near simultaneous_invention by two or more equally talented inventors working independently that occurrence may or may not be an indication of obviousness when considered in light of all the circumstances`
the trust takes issue with the district_courts reliance on the invention of the tecasa_machine as a simultaneous_invention
according to the trust martin and talken reduced their claimed invention to practice as early as 2001 whereas the parties stipulated that the tecasa_machine was first known in the united_states in june 2002
the trust argues that this timing can not constitute` contemporaneous' invention as a matter of law
the trusts argument would have more force if the tecasa_machine provided the only_evidence of simultaneous_invention
the existence of the pallmac and visy_machines however shows that the tecasa_machine was invented within a` comparatively short_space of time'
as *1306 discussed the evidence reveals that the relevant pallmac_machine was first installed in 1998 and the visy_machine was first sold in 1996 approximately three and five years respectively before the trust alleges its invention was reduced to practice
the district_court was therefore correct to conclude that the invention of the tecasa_machine occurring only a year later than the earliest possible reduction-to-practice date of the claimed invention qualified as a simultaneous_invention
as such`though not determinative of statutory obviousness [ it is ] strong_evidence of what constitutes the level of ordinary_skill in the art
`` ecolochem 227 f.3d at 1379 quoting the int l glass co. v. united_states 187_ct.cl._376 408_f.2d_395 405 1969

balancing all of the secondary_considerations this court agrees with the district_court that in light of the strong_evidence of obviousness based on the pallmac and visy prior_art coupled with the near-simultaneous_invention of the tecasa_machine the trusts objective evidence of non-obviousness even if fully credited by a jury would fail to make a difference in this case

iv
the parties raise a number of other issues including martins standing with respect to damages the district_courts denial of the trusts rule 50 b motion on infringement and the district_courts ruling as a matter of law that the trust failed to establish willful infringement
because the asserted claims of the ¡¬566_patent are invalid those remaining issues are moot
the district_courts judgment is affirmed

affirmed
