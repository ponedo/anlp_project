michel circuit_judge
ching-rong wang` wang' appeals from the judgment of the united_states_district_court for the district of columbia overturning the decision of the united states patent and trademark_office board of patent_appeals and interferences the` board' in an interference and holding that the inventions of claims 2_and_4 of u.s._patent_no._4935,047` the047_patent` and claims 9-11 of u.s. patent app
no._07 /478,411` the411 application' would not have been obvious in light of the cited prior_art
see winner_int l_royalty_corp. v. wang 11_f.supp.2d_18 48_uspq2d_1139_(d.d.c._june_12,_1998)
the047_patent issued to jinn wu` wu' and the411 application are owned by winner_international_royalty_corp.` winner'
the district_court had jurisdiction pursuant to 35 u.s.c.¡± 146 1994 because wu filed suit there after an adverse ruling by the board in an interference between himself and wang
winner as owner of wus patent superseded wu as plaintiff
the board held the wu patent and application claims invalid as obvious
see 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 1994
other litigation including suit against wang in which winner alleges infringement of its047_patent and asserts several related claims has been stayed in the central_district of california pending the outcome of this appeal
the district_court first denied wangs motion to transfer this action to the district_court for the central_district of california
see winner_int l_royalty_corp. v. wang 45_uspq2d_1864 1998_wl_268279 d.d.c
jan.20 1998
then it conducted a 7 day_bench_trial
on appeal wang challenges 1 the denial of the transfer ; 2 rulings as to the admission of evidence despite its similarity to that before the board ; and 3 the holding of non-obviousness that revived the047_patent
this case was submitted for our decision following oral_argument on august 2 1999
because the district_court did not clearly err in any of its factual_findings relating to obviousness did not err in its ultimate_determination of non-obviousness and did not abuse its discretion either in admitting the challenged documentary_evidence and testimony or in refusing to transfer the case we affirm

background
in addition to the047_patent winner also owns u.s._patent_no._4738,127` johnson' the commercial embodiment of which is the original steering_wheel anti-theft device known as` the club'
wu the principal in the taiwanese manufacturer of the original_club is named as the inventor in the047_patent commercial_embodiments of which are known as` the super_club'` the ultra_club' and` the club_gl'
the047_patent discloses an automobile *1343 anti-theft device that is mounted across the steering_wheel and is locked in place by use of a self-locking ratcheting mechanism
like all versions of the club when locked in place the commercial_embodiments of the047_patent prevent theft by blocking the steering_wheel from turning
the ratcheting mechanism is different from the dead-bolt used in johnson and so the047_patent may be thought of as an improvement over johnson
while johnsons dead-bolt system is more secure it is not as convenient as the ratcheting mechanism claimed in the047_patent because a key is required to lock the johnson device in place while the047_patent discloses a device that locks itself without use of a key.1

wang also manufactures similar anti-theft devices in taiwan and exports them to the u.s. where he sells them through his united states distributor
wangs device is known commercially as` the gorilla grip'
wang filed a patent_application directed to his gorilla grip device and was issued u.s._patent_no._4887,443` the443_patent`

in 1990 wu discovered that the device disclosed in wangs443_patent was very similar to the subject matter of his then-pending application which later issued as the047_patent and decided to provoke an interference by filing a divisional application and submitting a claim identical to the broadest claim in the443_patent
on august 8 1991 an interference was declared and a proceeding began to determine which party wu or wang had priority of invention
the claims of the047_patent and an additional wu application the411 application were eventually added to the count in the interference

during the interference_proceeding wang filed a preliminary motion alleging that the interference count and hence both parties claims was unpatentable as obvious in light of certain prior_art under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 1994
wang apparently acknowledging that his claim to priority over wus047_patent was questionable ultimately conceded that his443_patent was invalid and sought to prove that wus047_patent was also invalid

after a final_hearing the board in a split decision held all affected claims invalid except for claims 1_and_3 of the047_patent
wu then filed both an appeal to this court pursuant to 35 u.s.c.¡± 141 1994 and an action in the district_court for the district of columbia pursuant to 35 u.s.c.¡± 146 while wang filed a section 146 action in the district_court for the central_district of california
in wus section 141 appeal from the decision of the board this court determined that the section 146 suit would proceed pursuant to wus complaint in the district_court for the district of columbia
see wu v. wang 129_f.3d_1237 44_uspq2d_1641_(fed.cir.1997)
because wu filed his appeal first and responded in timely fashion to wangs notice of election by filing a section 146 action in the district_court for the district of columbia wus choice of forum governed
see id.at 1242-43 44 uspq2d at 1645-46
we then dismissed the section 141 appeal as superseded by the section 146 action
see id.at 1238 44 uspq2d at 1642

after the first appeal to this court wang filed a motion in the district_court to transfer the action to the central_district of california
the district_court denied the motion
see winner 45_uspq2d_1864
after a seven-day_bench_trial the district_court held that the inventions of claims 2_and_4 of the047_patent would not have been obvious in light of the cited prior_art
see winner 11_f.supp.2d_18 48_uspq2d_11392 at trial winner presented testimony on each of the four principal factual issues underlying an obviousness *1344 determination as well as affidavits
wang presented one expert witness to testify as to his opinion regarding obviousness and the underlying factual determinations
the record before the board was also admitted into evidence before the district_court

the focus of the trial was on four prior_art_references that wang alleged before the court as he had before the board rendered the invention of the047_patent obvious
these references were johnson mentioned above u.s. patent no._3462,982` moore' taiwan patent app
no._74210,699` wuroc' and french patent app
no._2566,398` grimaldi'
winner also introduced evidence of the commercial_success of its super_club_line of products
this evidence had not been presented to the board

like the device disclosed in the047_patent the mechanism of johnson immobilizes the steering_wheel by the user inserting it within the steering_wheel telescoping its arms outward so that hooks on the end of the arms engage the steering_wheel and then locking the arms in place
as stated earlier unlike the047_patent which discloses a self-locking ratcheting mechanism johnson uses a dead-bolt to lock the device in place which requires the user to turn a key after putting the device on the wheel
moore discloses a steering_wheel lock that unfolds into a` y' shape and utilizes a self-locking ratcheting mechanism which does not require a key
wuroc discloses a wheel and brake_pedal locking device with a versatile locking core that can accommodate either a dead-bolt or a self-locking ratcheting mechanism but it does not disclose either of these locking mechanisms
grimaldi discloses a two-piece mechanism for locking a clutch or brake_pedal to the floorboard or firewall of a car and its figures appear to show a rod and pawl mechanism that locks it into place

the key issue tried was the presence or absence of sufficient proof of a motivation to combine the four prior_art_references
the board had found that one skilled in the art 1` would have considered johnsons dead-bolt-type locking device to be disadvantageous compared to the moore and wuroc devices to the extent that johnson requires a key for setting in position and adjusting the device' and 2` would have been motivated to make johnson easier to use albeit less secure by replacing the dead-bolt_mechanism' of johnson with a suitable self-locking ratcheting mechanism
the district_court found that these factual_findings were` clearly erroneous' and found that adequate motivation to combine the references was not shown
see winner 11 f.supp.2d at 23-24 48 uspq2d at 1143-44
the district_court also found that winner established commercial_success resulting from the improvement claimed in the047_patent even though it held such a finding immaterial in light of wangs failure to establish a prima_facie_case of obviousness
see id
accordingly the district_court held that on this record the inventions of claims 2_and_4 of the047_patent would not have been obvious and overturned the boards decision as to those claims
see id.at 25 48 uspq2d at 1145

wang appeals contending that the district_court should have applied a substantial evidence standard of review on factual issues rather than as it said it was doing review for clear_error
wang asserts that the district_court incorrectly concluded that the invention of the claims would not have been obvious and abused its discretion in admitting the challenged documentary_evidence and testimony as duplicative of evidence in the board_record and in denying wangs motion to transfer the case to the central_district of california
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 3 c 1994

discussion
i
standard of review
we review the district_courts factual_findings for clear_error and its *1345 conclusions of law de novo as with any bench_trial
see gould v. quigg 822_f.2d_1074 1077 3_uspq2d_1302 1303-04 fed.cir.1987 affirming district_courts reversal of board decision with respect to enablement
it is not as clear however what degree of deference inheres in the standard of review the district_court was required to apply to the boards decision
the parties agree that the district_court was to reassess the boards ultimate conclusion as to obviousness de novo but they disagree over the degree of deference if any the district_court was required to give to the boards factual_findings
wang argues that under the supreme_courts decision in dickinson v. zurko 527_u.s._150 119_s.ct._1816 144_l.ed.2d_143_(1999) the district_court was required to review the boards factual_findings only for substantial evidentiary support
in its decision which issued before zurko was decided the district_court applied the traditional clearly erroneous standard of review to the boards findings of fact.3 winner argues first that the district_court was entitled to conduct an entire trial de novo and second even if deference were required that the district_court properly reviewed the boards factual_findings for clear_error because zurko and the administrative procedure act` apa' standards of review do not apply as the board proceeding is` subject to' a trial de novo in a district_court

wu brought this action pursuant to 35 u.s.c.¡± 146 which allows a party to an interference dissatisfied with an adverse decision of the board to file a complaint in a district_court
unlike a direct appeal to this court pursuant to 35 u.s.c.¡± 141 the parties before the district_court are not limited to the evidentiary record before the board in such suits the record in the patent and trademark_office shall be admitted on motion of either party.. without prejudice to the right of the parties to take further_testimony
the testimony and exhibits of the record in the patent and trademark_office when admitted shall have the same effect as if originally taken and produced in the suit
35 u.s.c.¡± 146 emphasis added
because the record before the district_court may include the evidence before the board as well as evidence that was not before the board we have often described the district_court proceeding as` a hybrid of an appeal and a trial de novo'
estee_lauder inc. v. l'oreal s.a. 129_f.3d_588 592 44_uspq2d_1610 1612 fed.cir.1997 ; see also general instrument corp. v. scientific-atlanta inc. 995_f.2d_209 212 27_uspq2d_1145 1147 fed.cir.1993` [ a ] party may proceed to a district_court for a hybrid appeal/trial de novo proceeding in which the pto record is admitted on motion of either party but it may be supplemented by further_testimony
35 u.s.c.¡± 146
`` ; case v. cpc int l inc. 730_f.2d_745 752 221_uspq_196 202 fed.cir.1984` [ a ] n action under 35 u.s.c.¡± 146 has the hybrid nature of an appeal and a trial de novo`
we have so stated even though section 146 uses neither the term` de novo' nor` appeal'
see conservolite inc. v. widmayer 21_f.3d_1098 1102 30_uspq2d_1626 1629 fed.cir.1994

the issue before us is whether the scope of the evidence admitted by the district_court was sufficient to require a complete trial de novo or whether the district_court was instead required to give deference to some or all of the boards findings of fact
although our precedent makes clear that a de novo_trial is appropriate in some circumstances in actions under both section 146 and the parallel provisions in 35 u.s.c.¡± 145 it does not make clear exactly what those circumstances are
the statutory provisions themselves offer little guidance-section 146 only refers to` further_testimony' which may be offered in the district_court while section 145 is completely silent about evidence
see 35 u.s.c.¡± 146 ; 35 u.s.c.¡± 145
in zurko the supreme_court in passing noted the settled law that in a section 145 action a disappointed applicant may present evidence *1346 that it did not present to the board and that the` presence of such new or different evidence makes a factfinder of the district judge'
119 s.ct.at 1824 emphasis added
interpreting both sections we have referred to the ability to present` new_testimony' or` proffered testimony' or` additional_evidence'
conservolite 21 f.3d at 1102 30 uspq2d at 1629` new_testimony' ; case 730 f.2d at 752 221 uspq at 202 finding that section 146` authorizes the district_court to accept all proffered testimony on issues raised by the parties during the proceedings below or by the boards decision
`` ; gould 822 f.2d at 1079 3 uspq2d at 1305` [ a ] dditional evidence is permitted in a civil action under section 145 allowing the district_court to make de novo fact findings
`` ; fregeau v. mossinghoff 776_f.2d_1034 1038 227_uspq_848 851 fed.cir.1985 using` additional_evidence' and` new evidence' interchangeably ; cf
newman v. quigg 877_f.2d_1575 1579 11_uspq2d_1340 1343 fed.cir.1989` a district_court action under 35 u.s.c.¡± 145 is a de novo determination of patentability
it is not limited to the record before the pto`
it is not clear from these cases however when evidence is` new or different' or` additional' so that trial de novo is required

here winner introduced evidence on the issue of commercial_success that was not before the board specifically a survey and a witness
such documentary_evidence and testimony are certainly` further_testimony' as the board had neither before it in any form
however winner also presented live_testimony in the district_court on each factual issue before the board namely the other three sets of underlying factual determinations typically at issue in an obviousness_determination
see graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 17-18 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966)
wang argues that this latter testimony was not adequate to trigger a de novo_trial because it is the same or similar to testimony given by the same witnesses before the board
we reject this argument

in the context of a section 145 action in which the board has conducted an ex parte_proceeding we have noted that the admission of live_testimony at trial requires the factfinder to make its own findings
see burlington_indus. inc. v. quigg 822_f.2d_1581 1584 3_uspq2d_1436 1439 fed.cir.1987
the rationale is that the applicant was at least partly unable to present the live_testimony in the ex parte_proceeding before the board
see id
in burlington_industries the commissioner argued that` the district_court can not reach a different_conclusion on the same evidence that was before the pto'
id
( emphasis added
we rejected the commissioners argument
although the import of the evidence before the board and the district_court might be the same in many or all ways the form in which it is presented is fundamentally different
as we noted in burlington_industries in its evaluation of the evidence on which this conclusion was based the district_court had a powerful_advantage over the patent examiner and the board an advantage characteristic of section 145 appeals in that the court heard and saw witnesses testifying under examination and cross-examination and had the benefit of extensive discussion and argument
id.at 1582 3 uspq2d at 1437-38 emphasis added
the fact that the district_court heard live_testimony gave more weight to some witnesses than to others and came to a different_conclusion than that reached by the board was not improper this trial before the district_court partook of the quality that is available only with the examination and cross-examination of live witnesses
...
if the evidence adduced before the district_court led to a decision different from that reached by the pto that is not contrary to the legislative purpose of section 145 de novo review
indeed it is in fulfillment of that purpose
id.at 1584 3 uspq2d at 1439 emphasis added
thus after a` full_trial of the issues' the district_court was free to come *1347 to its own` independent conclusion' contrary to the argument by the commissioner
id
; see also gould 822 f.2d at 1079 3 uspq2d at 1305` [ o ] nce a full_trial on the issue occurred.. the district_court reached a distinct and more informed conclusion..'

in the context of a section 146 action such as the instant case in which the board has conducted an inter partes interference_proceeding the matter is less clear because more evidentiary opportunities are available to parties in an interference than to an applicant in an ex parte_examination and appeal to the board
see in re epstein 32_f.3d_1559 1565-66 31_uspq2d_1817 1821 fed.cir.1994 noting lack of rules of evidence and inability to cross-examine witnesses in an ex parte_proceeding
in an interference unlike an ex parte_proceeding the federal rules of evidence apply
see 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.671 b 1998
in addition both sides can submit testimony initially in the form of affidavits unless the testimony must be compelled
see 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.672
a party may` cross-examine' an affiant through oral deposition
see 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.672 d
discovery at least against the party opponent is also available
see 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.687
however although the parties` will be given an opportunity to appear before the board to present oral_argument at a final_hearing' 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.654 at no point in the interference_proceeding is a party allowed to present live_testimony before the board
the board reviews testimony only in the form of affidavits and transcripts of depositions and other_facts in the form of responses to interrogatories and requests for admissions
see 37 c.f.r.¡±¡± 1.653 a 1.677 a
thus although the proceeding before the board in an interference differs from that following an ex parte_examination the two proceedings are the same in at least one important respect-in no case is live_testimony given before the board which would allow the board to observe demeanor to hear the witnesses rebut one anothers testimony in response to questioning from the parties and the judges and thus to determine credibility
as we have stated before because the district_court may observe witnesses under examination and cross-examination it can have a` powerful_advantage' over the board which can never receive testimony in such a manner
burlington_indus. 822 f.2d at 1582 3 uspq2d at 1437

we hold that the admission of live_testimony on all matters before the board in a section 146 action as in this case makes a factfinder of the district_court and requires a de novo_trial.4 thus although the live_testimony before the district_court might be the same or similar to testimony before the board in the form of affidavits and deposition_transcripts a district_court should still make de novo factual_findings while treating the record before the board when offered by a party` as if [ it was ] originally taken and produced' in the district_court
35 u.s.c.¡± 146
accordingly because winner submitted live_testimony on all matters before the board the entire district_court proceeding should have been a trial de novo based both on the board_record and the district_court evidence.5

our holding comports with the notion that` [ t ] he credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony and the other evidence in the record.. is a matter for the trier of facts'
gyromat corp. v. champion spark plug co. 735_f.2d_549 552 222_uspq_4 6 fed.cir.1984
further our holding also establishes *1348 a clear rule that live_testimony admitted on all matters that were before the board triggers a de novo_trial
if our holding were otherwise it might be difficult to administer
for example if the test for determining whether de novo adjudication is appropriate were based on exactly what the witness said in the district_court and whether it was truly` new or different' than what was disclosed in affidavits and deposition_transcripts of the same or other witnesses before the board then the district_court and this court on appeal would be required to search nearly line-by-line through the respective records as to each witness and issue to determine which standard applied
aside from being difficult such a test would provide scant guidance for a prospective litigant attempting to discern which standard would apply should it file a section 146 action

ii
obviousness
a. obviousness is a question of law based on underlying factual inquiries including 1 the scope and content of the prior_art ; 2 the level of ordinary_skill in the art ; 3 the differences between the prior_art and the claimed invention ; and 4 extent of any objective indicia of non-obviousness
see monarch knitting mach corp. v. sulzer morat gmbh 139_f.3d_877 881 45_uspq2d_1977 1981 fed.cir.1998
the ultimate_determination of obviousness by a district_court is reviewed by this court de novo while the underlying factual inquiries are reviewed for clear_error
see weatherchem corp. v. j.l
clark inc. 163_f.3d_1326 1331 49_uspq2d_1001 1006 fed.cir.1998
we hold that this is so as much in a section 146 action as on review of the judgment in an infringement suit

the dispute here focuses on the combinability of the prior_art
when an obviousness_determination is based on multiple prior_art_references there must be a showing of some` teaching suggestion or reason' to combine the references
gambro_lundia_ab v. baxter healthcare corp. 110_f.3d_1573 1579 42_uspq2d_1378 1383 fed.cir.1997 also noting that the` absence of such a suggestion to combine is dispositive in an obviousness_determination'
whether motivation to combine the references was shown we hold a question of fact
see in re dembiczak 175_f.3d_994 1000 50_uspq2d_1614 1617 fed.cir.1999` [ p ] articular factual_findings regarding the suggestion teaching or motivation to combine serve a number of important purposes..' emphasis added ; monarch knitting 139 f.3d at 881-83 886 45 uspq2d at 1982 1985 treating motivation to combine issue as part of the scope and content of the prior_art and holding that genuine issues of fact existed as to whether one of ordinary_skill in the art would have been motivated to combine the references in question

evidence of a suggestion teaching or motivation to combine prior_art_references may flow inter alia from the references themselves the knowledge of one of ordinary_skill in the art or from the nature of the problem to be solved
see dembiczak 175 f.3d at 999 50 uspq2d at 1617
although a reference need not expressly teach that the disclosure contained therein should be combined with another see motorola inc. v. interdigital tech corp. 121_f.3d_1461 1472 43_uspq2d_1481 1489 fed.cir.19976 the showing of *1349 combinability in whatever form must nevertheless be` clear and particular'
dembiczak 175 f.3d at 999 50 uspq2d at 1617

b
like the district_courts opinion the arguments of both parties on appeal focus on whether one of ordinary_skill would have been motivated to combine the four references
the key references at issue were johnson which discloses virtually all aspects of the invention claimed in the047_patent except ratcheting and moore which did disclose a self-locking ratcheting mechanism.7 if there was no motivation or suggestion to combine johnson with the ratcheting mechanism of moore one of ordinary_skill in the art would not have viewed the invention of the047_patent as obvious
see in re dance 160_f.3d_1339 1343 48_uspq2d_1635 1637 fed.cir.1998 ; gambro_lundia_ab 110 f.3d at 1579 42 uspq2d at 1383` the absence of such a suggestion to combine is dispositive in an obviousness_determination
``

wang argues that the prior_art should be combinable merely because the board properly found that the relevant field was very broad and included lock design art in general and all of the prior_art here was clearly within that field
wang further argues that moore is combinable with johnson because they both deal with locking steering_wheels even though moores ratcheting mechanism is possibly not as strong or as tamper resistant as the dead-bolt_mechanism of johnson partly because the grooves of the ratcheting mechanism are at least somewhat exposed

the district_court found that there was no motivation to combine johnson with the ratcheting mechanism of moore because 1 there was no apparent disadvantage to the dead-bolt_mechanism of johnson and therefore the motivation to combine would not stem from the` nature of the problem' facing one of ordinary_skill in the art because no` problem' was perceived ; and 2 johnsons written description taught away from the use of moore
see winner 11 f.supp.2d at 23 48 uspq2d at 1143-44
`` what a reference teaches and whether it teaches toward or away from the claimed invention are questions of fact'
in re bell 991 f.2d at 784 26 uspq2d at 1531

first although there was conflicting evidence before the district_court on whether one would see the trade-off between using a dead-bolt and using a ratcheting mechanism and conclude that the more secure dead-bolt should be replaced with the more convenient ratcheting mechanism the district_court did not clearly err in finding that one of ordinary_skill in the art would not have reasonably elected trading the benefit of security for that of convenience
trade-offs often concern what is feasible not what is on balance desirable
motivation to combine requires the latter.8

second if johnson did in fact teach away from moore then that finding *1350 alone can defeat wangs obviousness claim

a` reference will teach away if it suggests that the line of development flowing from the references disclosure is unlikely to be productive of the result sought by the applicant'
in re gurley 27_f.3d_551 553 31_uspq2d_1130 1131 fed.cir.1994

the passage of johnson relied on by the district_court and winner includes the following another problem with such devices is that they appear susceptible to being overcome by physical force or manipulation
the locking mechanisms of [ moore ] and mitchell et al u.s. pat
no._4103,524 are exposed and include pry points thereabout in which a crowbar may be inserted in an attempt to overcome such mechanism
irrespective of whether such device can be overcome by physical manipulation they present prospective thieves with the appearance of being breakable
johnson col. 1 lines 38-48
because the mitchell reference cited in the quote above actually does not utilize a ratcheting mechanism wang argues that johnson does not teach away from using ratcheting mechanisms ; rather it was merely distinguishing prior_art devices on the basis that unlike johnson they had exposed mechanisms
however that fact does not undermine the district_courts finding that johnson did teach away from the ratcheting mechanism of moore which does have exposed grooves
while we regard this as a close factual issue we hold that the district_court did not clearly err in finding that johnson taught away from moore and therefore was not shown to be combinable with moore
because the district_court did not clearly err in finding that one of ordinary_skill would not be motivated to combine johnson and moore the district_court correctly concluded that wang did not establish a prima_facie_case of obviousness by clear and convincing evidence
see in re dance 160 f.3d at 1343 48 uspq2d at 1637

if wang had succeeded in establishing a prima_facie_case of obviousness based on the first three obviousness factors the burden of production would have shifted to winner
see in re huang 100_f.3d_135 139 40_uspq2d_1685 1689 fed.cir.1996 ; burlington_indus. 822 f.2d at 1582-83 3 uspq2d at 1437-38 reviewing a section 145 decision and holding that district_court correctly concluded that applicant had successfully rebutted commissioners prima_facie_case of obviousness
relevant to that inquiry would have been such objective indicia of non-obviousness as the evidence of commercial_success submitted by winner
see id
because wang failed to establish a prima_facie_case of obviousness however winner was not required to establish commercial_success
thus we need not review the district_courts finding that commercial_success was established

assuming arguendo prima facie proof of obviousness we do not believe the district_court clearly erred in finding commercial_success or that it erred in concluding that it overcame the other graham factors
it is presumed that winner established a nexus between its commercial sales of the super_club the club_gl and ultra_club and the patented features because they embody the disclosure of the047 improvement_patent
j.t
eaton & co. v. atlantic paste & glue co. 106_f.3d_1563 1571 41_uspq2d_1641 1647 fed.cir.1997` when a patentee can demonstrate commercial_success usually shown by significant sales in a relevant market and that the successful product is the invention disclosed and claimed in the patent it is presumed that the commercial_success is due to the patented_invention`
moreover the survey introduced at the district_court by winner established that a statistically significant percentage of customers viewed the self-locking ratcheting mechanism of the047_patent as being of more value to them and reported that the self-locking ratchet was the very reason they purchased the device as opposed to *1351 those requiring key-locking and was the reason they were willing to pay more for such a lock than for one without it such as the original_club
when such evidence was introduced it became wangs burden to show that it should not be given weight
see id
(` if a patentee makes the requisite showing of nexus between commercial_success and the patented_invention the burden shifts to the challenger to prove that the commercial_success is instead due to other factors extraneous to the patented_invention such as advertising or superior workmanship
`` ; demaco corp. v. f. von langsdorff licensing ltd. 851_f.2d_1387 1394 7_uspq2d_1222 1227 fed.cir.1988` a patentee is not required to prove as part of its prima_facie_case that the commercial_success of the patented_invention is not due to factors other than the patented_invention`
given the evidence before the district_court it did not clearly err in finding that the survey showed the nexus between the patented features especially the keyless self-locking ratcheting mechanism of the super_club_line of products and the reasons the consumers bought the products
nor did wangs evidence overcome the proof of nexus

iii
evidentiary issues
a district_courts decision to admit or exclude evidence at trial is reviewed for abuse of discretion
see conservolite 21 f.3d at 1103 30 uspq2d at 1630 fed.cir.1994
wang argues that the district_court abused its discretion by allowing winner to present 1 late-disclosed witnesses and 2 documents and testimony pertaining to the nexus required to show commercial_success namely a survey and foundational witnesses for the survey
wang admits that the commercial_success_issue was raised before the board but argues that the subsidiary nexus_issue was not and therefore winner could not raise the issue before the district_court as it must be deemed waived

winner points out that wang never even identifies which witnesses should not have been allowed to testify as` late-disclosed'
with respect to the evidence of commercial_success winner argues that the nexus evidence was clearly admissible because commercial_success was at issue before the board and therefore by implication the nexus_issue was as well

we agree with winner that the district_court did not abuse its discretion in allowing allegedly late-disclosed witnesses to testify
such witnesses were never even identified by wang in his opening brief and after winner pointed this out in its response brief wang still failed to identify the witnesses in his reply brief
under such_circumstances we will not search the record on the chance of discovering which witnesses wang was complaining of and then determine whether the district_court abused its discretion
thus whichever witnesses wang was alluding to admission of their testimony can not be said to be an abuse of discretion based on the vague arguments made by wang on appeal

we also agree with winner that the district_court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the new_testimony and survey report regarding the nexus between commercial_success and the patentably distinct_feature of the claimed invention
wangs argument based on a distinction between the issues of commercial_success and nexus is flawed
the evidence showing a nexus between large sales and the patentable features of the invention of the047 improvement_patent is at least relevant to the issue of commercial_success before the board
see estee_lauder 129 f.3d at 592 44 uspq2d at 1613` [ d ] istrict court did not abuse its discretion in allowing estee_lauder to introduce evidence of the [ tests not before the board ] insofar as this evidence was relevant to its reduction to practice'
( emphasis added
indeed establishing such a nexus is required in order to establish commercial_success
see gambro lundia 110 f.3d at 1579 42 uspq2d at 1384` of course *1352 the record must show a sufficient nexus between this commercial_success and the patented_invention'
thus here raising the commercial_success_issue necessarily raised the nexus_issue as well
accordingly the district_court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the testimony and documents relating to the nexus required to show commercial_success

iv
motion to transfer
a district_court may transfer an action to another district_court for the` convenience of parties and witnesses in the interest of justice'
28 u.s.c.¡± 1404 a 1994
our review of the district_courts denial of wangs motion to transfer as a procedural matter is governed by the law of the regional circuit in which it sits here the united_states_court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit
see stewart org. inc. v. ricoh corp. 487_u.s._22 32 108_s.ct._2239 101_l.ed.2d_22_(1988) classifying section 1404 a as a procedural rule ; regents of the univ
of cal
v. eli lilly and co. 119_f.3d_1559 1565 43_uspq2d_1398 1403 fed.cir.1997 applying regional circuit law
in that circuit the burden of persuasion on the transfer issue was on wang and the district_courts denial of wangs motion is reviewed for an abuse of discretion
see securities and exchange comm n v. savoy_indus. inc. 587_f.2d_1149 1154 d.c.cir.1978

wang argues that the district_court should have granted his motion to transfer this action to the district_court for the central_district of california where several_other_cases have been stayed pending the outcome of the interference and this action because to do so would be convenient to the parties and in the interests of justice
winner argues however that it was just as convenient for the parties to litigate in washington d.c. as in california and that the interests of justice actually favored litigation in washington d.c. because this aspect of the litigation will be resolved years before it would have been if the motion to transfer were granted

we discern no abuse of discretion in the district_courts denial of wangs motion to transfer
even though there are several related pending cases in the central_district of california it is not clear that it would be a more convenient location for the parties to litigate
persons scheduled to testify at trial for the parties lived in pennsylvania ; the experts lived in connecticut virginia and california ; and the attorneys were from virginia and new_york
with parties witnesses and attorneys coming from such varied locations several of which are closer to washington d.c. than california it could not easily be said that it would be more convenient to try the case in the central_district of california
in addition the interests of judicial economy were well served because the section 146 action was tried and result obtained in just six months after the motion to transfer was denied-presumably much more quickly than would have been the case if this action were transferred to the central_district of california where several_other_cases were pending
see savoy_indus. 587 f.2d at 1156 considering the delay that would have been encountered if the motion to transfer were granted as a factor weighing in favor of denying the motion
under such_circumstances the district_court did not abuse its discretion in denying wangs motion to transfer

v. conclusion
the district_court did not clearly err in its findings of fact with respect to its obviousness analysis and did not err in concluding that the invention of the047_patent would not have been obvious
in addition the district_court did not abuse its discretion in admitting testimony and documents or in refusing to transfer the *1353 case
accordingly the judgment of the district_court is

affirmed

that standard of review was correct under our case_law at the time

as this case involved further_testimony relating to everything in issue before the board we express no opinion on whether testimony relating solely to some facts or issues results in other_facts or issues being reviewed deferentially based solely on the fact findings of the board
indeed we do not decide whether a given dispute could be parsed into discrete` issues' or facts so that such a determination could be made or if it could how a court would draw the line between such facts or issues

the trial courts failure to apply the de novo standard if error was harmless error for surely the result would have been the same under non-deferential review

wang correctly points out that the district_court misstated our case_law on the test for the` motivation to combine' issue when it stated that` there must have been some explicit teaching or suggestion in the art to motivate one of even ordinary_skill to combine such elements so as to create the same invention'
winner 11 f.supp.2d at 24 48 uspq2d at 1144 emphasis added
however this misstatement could not have affected its analysis because its finding of a lack of a motivation to combine was based on` teaching away' and the nature of the problem confronting one of ordinary_skill in the art not what a reference failed to explicitly disclose
the district_court also stated the law on this issue correctly in other portions of the opinion so this one isolated misstatement hardly shows that the district_court misunderstood the law
7
wuroc which disclosed a chamber capable of accepting either a dead-bolt or a ratcheting mechanism may have informed one of ordinary_skill in the art that both mechanisms would work but it did not specifically disclose any such mechanisms and did not suggest that one should be replaced with the other
grimaldi disclosed a rod and pawl design that was an anti-theft device attached to the clutch rather than a steering_wheel
the district_court did not clearly err in finding that` wuroc and grimaldi in and of themselves would certainly not provide much guidance as to how to construct the wu047 device' and that if johnson was not combined` with some form of a ratchet mechanism then the fact that wu047 may have borrowed some elements from wuroc and grimaldi becomes irrelevant'

the fact that the motivating benefit comes at the expense of another benefit however should not nullify its use as a basis to modify the disclosure of one reference with the teachings of another
instead the benefits both lost and gained should be weighed against one another
