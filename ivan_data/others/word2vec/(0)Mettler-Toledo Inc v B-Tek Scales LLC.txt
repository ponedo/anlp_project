opinion
moore circuit_judge mettler-toledo inc. mettler filed suit accusing b-tek_scales llc b-tek of infringing claims of u.s. patent nos._4815,547 ¡¬547_patent and 4,804,052 ¡¬052_patent
after the district_court construed the claims a jury determined that the claims of the ¡¬547_patent were not infringed and that the claims of the ¡¬052_patent were both not infringed and invalid
mettler appeals the district_courts denial of judgment as a matter of law jmol for each of these determinations
because the district_court correctly construed the claims of the ¡¬547_patent and because substantial_evidence supports the jurys verdict of invalidity of the ¡¬052_patent we affirm

cross-appellant b-tek appeals the district_courts denial of sanctions for alleged withholding and destruction of relevant documents
because the district_court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the documents were not highly relevant and that there was little harm to b-tek we affirm

background
the ¡¬547 and ¡¬052_patent s relate to technology for weighing_objects such as large_commercial_trucks
the ¡¬547_patent describes an individual load_cell that is one of several cells used in a scale
the cell produces an electrical signal in response to being deformed by an external force such as an object to be weighed
the ¡¬052_patent describes a system and method for measuring the weight of moveable objects on a scale
specifically the patent discloses a system for correcting weight measurements based on the location of objects on a scale
for example an object placed at one end of a scale may exert more pressure on the weight sensors positioned at that end than an identical object *1294 placed in the center
the ¡¬052_patent describes correcting for this load_position so that the same total weight will be determined regardless of the placement of the object

mettler sued b-tek alleging infringement of certain claims of the ¡¬547 and ¡¬ 052 patents
the district_court construed the claims and the case proceeded to trial where the jury found that b-tek did not infringe any of the asserted claims of the ¡¬547 and ¡¬052_patent s. the jury also determined that the asserted claims of the ¡¬052_patent would have been obvious
mettler filed a motion for jmol on both the infringement and invalidity issues which the court denied
mettler appeals the district_courts denial of its motion for jmol for both patents
b-tek cross appeals the district_courts denial of sanctions
we have jurisdiction under 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

i. ¡¬547_patent
the ¡¬547_patent describes a load_cell for measuring a force
¡¬547_patent col.1 ll.51-53
the cell utilizes a counterforce attached to a circuit board illustrated in figure 5

?
*1295 the circuit includes strain gauges 75 76 79_and_80 which via a bridge circuit create an analog electrical signal related to an objects weight
id
col.4 ll.62-66
this analog signal is converted to a digital_signal by` multiple_slope integrating analog-to-digital a/d converter 100'
id
col.5 ll.1-2
this digital_signal is then sent to microprocessor 105
id
col.5 ll.9-15
claim 1 is illustrative of the asserted claims weighing apparatus comprising a counterforce transducer means mounted on said counterforce circuit_means associated with said counterforce said circuit_means being responsive to external_control and including means for producing digital_representations of loads applied to said counterforce means for applying at least one correction factor to said digital_representations and means for transmitting said digital_representations means providing a sealed enclosure for said transducer means and said circuit_means means providing a path through said enclosure means for external communication with said circuit_means
the district_court construed a number of the means-plus-function claim terms including the terms in dispute` circuit_means associated with said counterforce said circuit_means being responsive to external_control'` means for producing digital_representations of loads applied to said counterforce' and` means for transmitting said digital_representations'
it held that for each of these terms the associated structure in the specification includes the multiple_slope integrating a/d_converter and equivalents thereof
for example for the term` means for producing digital_representations of loads applied to said counterforce' the district_court held that the corresponding structure was` a multiple_slope integrating analog-to-digital a/d converter and equivalents thereof'
mettler-toledo inc. v. fairbanks scales inc. 551_f.supp.2d_576 598 e.d.tex.2008
in the accused products the a/d_converter is a delta-sigma_a/d_converter
the jury determined that the accused products did not infringe either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents
in its jmol motion mettler argued that the delta-sigma_a/d_converter is equivalent to the multiple_slope integrating a/d_converter
the district_court held that substantial_evidence supported the jurys verdict that they were not equivalent pointing to trial testimony by b-teks expert and a corporate representative from another defendant that there are substantial differences between the two types of converters

on appeal mettler limits its arguments to a single claim construction issue whether the district_court improperly construed the relevant claim terms to require a multiple_slope integrating a/d_converter rather than any generic_a/d_converter
mettler argues that the district_court erred by importing the structure of only the preferred_embodiment or best_mode of the disclosure into the claim
it contends that a/d_converters are well-known in the art and that there was no reason to limit the structure to only the multiple_slope integrating a/d_converter
it further points to figure 5 that illustrates an` analog to digital converter 100'
it argues that this shows that the specification discloses generic_a/d_converters as well as the more specific multiple_slope integrating embodiment
mettler contends that the abstract by mentioning a generic_a/d_converter supports its broad construction
finally mettler points out that the district_court applied a different_construction for the ¡¬052_patent holding that a generic_a/d_converter is included in the claim terms *1296 construction
it argues that the two patent_specifications are very similar and both disclose a generic_a/d_converter linked to the claimed functions

citing medical instrumentation & diagnostics corp. v. elekta ab 344_f.3d_1205 1211 fed.cir.2003 b-tek responds that the patent never links a generic_a/d_converter to the claimed functions
it points out that the a/d_converter shown in figure 5 is only referred to in the specification as` multiple_slope integrating analog-to-digital a/d converter 100'
¡¬547_patent col.5 ll.1-2
it argues that every mention of a converter in the specification refers back to this specific type of converter

we agree with the district_court that the appropriate_structure for the disputed means-plus-function_claim_elements in the ¡¬547_patent is the multiple_slope integrating a/d_converter and equivalents thereof
our case law is clear that a means-plus-function_claim_limitation is limited to the structures disclosed in the specification and equivalents
med
instrumentation & diagnostics 344 f.3d at 1210
a court must look to the specification to determine the structures that correspond to the claimed function
`` [ s ] tructure disclosed in the specification iscorresponding structure only if the specification or prosecution_history clearly links or associates that structure to the function recited in the claim'
b. braun med inc. v. abbott labs. 124_f.3d_1419 1424 fed.cir.1997
if a patentee chooses to disclose a single_embodiment then any means-plus-function_claim_limitation will be limited to the single disclosed structure and equivalents thereof
see nomos corp. v. brainlab u.s.a. inc. 357_f.3d_1364 1368 fed.cir.2004

the ¡¬547_patent discloses a single_embodiment for the claimed invention that uses a multiple_slope integrating a/d_converter
in every instance where the specification refers to an` a/d_converter' see e.g. ¡¬547_patent col.5 l.14 it is referring to the preferred_embodiment which only includes the multiple_slope integrating a/d_converter 100
although generic_a/d_converters were known in the art the patentee chose to use means-plus-function language which limits it to the disclosed embodiments and equivalents
while mettler argues that the district_court erred by limiting it to the` best_mode' the best_mode was also the only structure disclosed in the specification

we are not persuaded that the single statement in the abstract regarding an` a/d_converter' requires a different result
this disclosure is not linked to any claimed function as required by our precedent and therefore does not support a broader construction
b. braun med. 124 f.3d at 1424
further the district_courts different_construction in the ¡¬052_patent is not at odds with its construction in the ¡¬547_patent
while the two patent_specifications are very similar the ¡¬052_patent differs in an important way in the summary of the invention the ¡¬052_patent mentions a generic_a/d_converter and links it to the claimed function
¡¬052_patent col.2 ll.21-24
mettler relied on this language in its claim construction argument for the ¡¬052_patent
the district_court correctly held that the ¡¬052_patent linked a generic_a/d_converter to the claimed function
in contrast the ¡¬547_patent does not include this language and is thus limited to the only a/d_converter that it discloses-the multiple_slope integrating a/d_converter
the district_court correctly held that the multiple_slope integrating a/d_converter was the only converter disclosed by the ¡¬547_patent and linked to the claimed functions
therefore we affirm the district_courts denial of jmol of infringement

*1297 ii
¡¬052_patent
the ¡¬052_patent teaches a system and method for correctly measuring the weight of an object regardless of where that object sits on the scale
¡¬052_patent col.6 ll.28-42
this system is particularly useful when measuring the weight of trucks or other large equipment because the load will rarely be positioned identically from one measurement to the next
the system includes a number of load_cells like the one described in the ¡¬547_patent arranged around a scale
depending on the location of the load to be weighed these cells will indicate different weights
the system is calibrated to create an equation that allows for correction for the differing load_positions so that regardless of the load_position the same weight will be measured
id
col.6 ll.52-60

the jury found that the ¡¬052_patent was both invalid for obviousness and not infringed
the district_court denied mettlers jmol motions on both issues
claim 1 is illustrative weighing apparatus comprising a plurality of load_cells load_receiving_means supported by said load_cells means associated with said load_cells for providing a digital_representation of a load on each load_cell means for storing a mathematical_expression for load corrected for load_position and
means for applying said mathematical_expression to said digital_load_representations to produce a digital_representation of the total load on said load_receiving_means corrected for load_position
claim 7 is a similar method drawn to` compensating a multiple_load_cell_scale for load_position'

the jury returned a verdict that the asserted claims would have been obvious
on appeal mettler argues that jmol should have been granted because gb 1,462,808 avery does not teach correcting for load_position which is a limitation of each asserted claim

what is disclosed by a prior art reference is a question of fact
uniloc usa inc. v. microsoft corp. 632_f.3d_1292 1323 fed.cir.2011 ; upjohn co. v. mova pharm corp. 225_f.3d_1306 1310 fed.cir.2000
and given the jury verdict of obviousness we must presume that the jury found the facts that support its determination
upjohn 225 f.3d at 1310
we conclude that substantial_evidence supports the jury_determination that avery teaches correcting for load_position

avery discloses a system using several transducers to measure a single load
j.a
7861 ll.52-61
using calibration_data which may be an equation the system corrects for an` unevenly loaded' scale
id
this is sufficient for a jury to find that it discloses correcting for a load_position
moving a load to one end of a scale rather than the center would amount to` uneven_loading'
further b-teks expert testified that avery disclosed this feature thus providing more evidence on which the jury could rely

referring only to claim 7 mettler argues another factual issue-whether avery teaches away from the claimed invention
spectralytics inc. v. cordis corp. 649_f.3d_1336 1343 fed.cir.2011 holding that whether the prior art teaches away from the claimed invention is a questions of fact
mettler contends that claim 7 of the ¡¬052_patent explicitly requires` compensating a multiple_load_cell_scale' but the avery reference teaches away from the claimed invention stating` because the transducer signals are corrected or adjusted individually.. the combined output need not be corrected to compensate *1298 for uneven_loading'
j.a
7862 ll.69-74

read in context there is substantial_evidence for the jurys conclusion that avery does not teach away
claim 7 requires` compensating a multiple_load_cell_scale'
while avery states that it eliminates the need to` compensate for uneven_loading' it is clearly discussing the timing and location of any adjustments or corrections
in avery each individual transducer or load_cell is individually corrected for` uneven_loading'
this means that when each transducer measurement is considered together there is no need for additional compensation
claim 7 of the ¡¬052_patent clearly covers this type of correction
it requires 1 determining a mathematical_expression 2 interrogating each load_cell or transducer in avery to receive a` digital load representation' and 3` applying said mathematical_expression to said digital_load_representations'
this encompasses correcting each individual reading or an overall reading
thus avery does not teach away from the claimed invention.1 mettler also argues that avery fails to teach moving a weight around the scale to calibrate the system
because the claims do not require moving a weight around the scale avery need not expressly teach this particular calibration technique
we affirm the district_courts denial of jmol on the nonobviousness of the ¡¬052_patent

iii
cross-appeal
b-tek cross-appeals the district_courts denial of sanctions for alleged discovery_abuses by mettler
we apply the law of the regional_circuit when considering the denial of sanctions
clearvalue inc. v. pearl river polymers inc. 560_f.3d_1291 1304 fed.cir.2009
fifth circuit precedent requires that we review the district_courts order for an abuse of discretion
id
a district_court abuses its discretion when its` ruling is based on an erroneous_view of the law or on a clearly erroneous_assessment of the evidence'
id
fact findings are not clearly erroneous unless` the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed'
anderson v. city of bessemer city 470_u.s._564 573 105_s.ct._1504 84_l.ed.2d_518_(1985)

in order to develop its case rebutting lost profits damages b-tek requested documents related to mettlers manufacturing_capacity
mettler stated that it had no such documents
during trial a mettler employee admitted that certain documents existed-a production_schedule and a plant diagram-and that some of these documents had been destroyed
further mettler admitted that it provided some of these documents to its own damages expert during the preparation of its case showing that mettler appreciated the documents relevance
b-tek moved for sanctions including attorneys fees
the district_court denied the motion
it noted that mettler did not hide the documents because mettlers representative in a deposition spoke about manufacturing capability and mentioned the production_schedule
further the district_court found that the documents were not particularly relevant stating *1299 production schedules are as the court understands them merely an ever-changing real-time representation of mettler-toledos backlog and unlikely to provide much if any relevant information about manufacturing_capacity
nor does the court see how a physical layout diagram of the masstron facility would be relevant
j.a
170
the district_court also noted that b-tek could not show the requisite harm or prejudice because` [ b-tek ] ultimately prevailed at trial on the issue of infringement' so it did not have to rely on its damages case
id
thus the court held` assuming there was a discovery violation at all which is somewhat doubtful it does not rise to the level of sanctionable behavior under rule 37'
id

we hold that the district_court did not abuse its discretion
it correctly considered the relevance of the documents and any harm to b-tek due to the withholding
the district_court determined that the documents in question were at best only somewhat relevant
the court also concluded that there was no harm to b-tek
b-tek can not point to any` erroneous_view of the law or [ ] a clearly erroneous_assessment of the evidence' and thus we affirm
clearvalue 560 f.3d at 1304

affirmed

b-tek responds to an argument that mettler did not put forth in its opening brief-that avery fails to disclose the equation from the ¡¬ 052 patent that the court construed to be a part of a means-plus-function limitation
avery discloses that` [ t ] he calibration_data may for example be in the form of factors to be multiplied and/or algebraically summated with the respective transducer output'
avery p. 2 ll.45-50
this amounts to substantial_evidence because it is simply a prosaic description of the equation disclosed in the ¡¬052_patent
