because we conclude that the district_court properly granted summary_judgment of noninfringement we affirm

*1352 background
bai is the inventor and owner of the076_patent directed to a` target_game'
he asserted that wingss magic_catch target_game infringes claim 1 of his patent
magic_catch is similar to the invention of claim 1 but has one primary difference
while the patent discloses and claims a` hemispherical' glove as shown below

?
the magic_catchs glove is saucer- or frisbee_the_r-shaped
in other words the plastic backside of the magic_catch_glove is largely flat in the middle but curved on the ends
at issue in this case is whether the limitation` hemispherical' excludes wingss largely flat product

the patent application as originally filed had the following three claims that are relevant here 1
a target_game including a glove ; a sheet of fabric_material mounted on the glove and extending across the front_face thereof to constitute a target for a missile thrown thereagainst
2
the target_game defined in claim 1 in which the glove is formed of a rigid plastic material and has a dish_shape
3
the target_game defined in claim 2 in which the sheet of fabric_material is mounted on the glove in spaced relationship therewith so as to present a resilient_surface which is deflectable inwardly when struck by the missile

the examiner rejected all the claims particularly dependent claim 3 on obviousness grounds over a combination of four patents muchnick u.s._patent 3,953,030 ; craig u.s._patent 1,633,926 ; lemelson et al. u.s._patent 3,857,566 ; and hartel u.s._patent 3,378,260
specifically the examiner stated that it would have been obvious to combine the dish-shaped structure disclosed in the hartel_patent with the` target' disclosed in the lemelson patent and that because the lemelson_target is hand-held it is a kind of glove that can be substituted for the gloves disclosed in the muchnick and craig patents
in response bai canceled claims 2_and_3 and amended claim 1 to incorporate the claim 2_and_3 limitations and to add the limitation that the glove was` hemispherical
`` 1 bai remarked that he was amending claim 1 to` specifically and expressly recite the structural_details' of his invention noting its` particular_configuration'
he distinguished the gloves disclosed in muchnick and craig as having different structures and functions from the amended claim and distinguished the lemelson_target as not having a glove
bai did not address the hartel_patent but summarily stated that he believed the other references cited by the examiner were irrelevant
the examiner then allowed amended claim 1 which reads as follows

1
a target_game including a glove formed of a hemispherical dish-shaped rigid plastic_member a strap mounted *1353 on the rear_side of the plastic_member to enable the glove to be held on the palm of the hand of a player ; a sheet of fabric_material mounted on the glove and extending across the front_face of the dish-shaped rigid plastic_member to constitute a target for a missile thrown thereagainst said sheet of fabric_material being mounted on the plastic_member in spaced relationship with the inner surface thereof so as to present a resilient_surface which is deflectable inwardly when struck by the missile
( emphasis added
bai filed suit against wings for patent infringement
the parties filed cross-motions for summary_judgment on the question of infringement focusing in their briefs on the term` hemispherical' and also addressing the prosecution_history_estoppel presumption established by the supreme_court in warner-jenkinson v. hilton davis chem co. 520_u.s._17 117_s.ct._1040 137_l.ed.2d_146 41_uspq2d_1865_(1997)
in its opinion the district_court construed the term` hemispherical' to include structures that are` less than a sphere but.. nevertheless a part of a sphere' apparently because the glove pictured in figure 2 is close to a hemispherical shape although it is not exactly hemispherical
see bai 1997_wl_527870 at *2
the district_court concluded that the magic_catchs` perceptibly flattened surface' did not meet the claim_limitation` hemispherical' and thus did not literally infringe claim 1
bai 1997_wl_527870 at *2
the court also concluded that bai added the term` hemispherical' in response to the ¡± 103 rejection and that bai did not establish that this amendment was unrelated to patentability
see id. 1997_wl_527870 at *4-*5
the court thus concluded that prosecution_history_estoppel limited_bai to products that are hemispherical in shape and accordingly held that magic_catch did not infringe claim 1 under the doctrine of equivalents
see id. 1997_wl_527870 at *5
this appeal followed
we have jurisdiction under 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1 1994

discussion
we review a district_courts grant of summary_judgment de novo
see conroy v. reebok int l ltd. 14_f.3d_1570 1575 29_uspq2d_1373 1377 fed.cir.1994
summary_judgment is proper` if the pleadings depositions answers to interrogatories and admissions on file together with the affidavits if any show that there is no genuine_issue as to any material_fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law'
fed.r.civ.p
56 c
summary_judgment is improper` if the evidence is such that a reasonable_jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party'
anderson v. liberty lobby inc. 477_u.s._242 248 106_s.ct._2505 91_l.ed.2d_202_(1986)
when ruling on a motion for summary_judgment all of the nonmovants evidence is to be believed and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in its favor
see id.at 255 106_s.ct._2505

determining whether a patent claim has been infringed involves two steps 1 claim_construction to determine the scope of the claims followed by 2 determination whether the properly construed claim encompasses the accused structure
see e.g. cole v. kimberly-clark corp. 102_f.3d_524 528 41_uspq2d_1001 1004 fed.cir.1996
the first step claim_construction is a matter of law which this court reviews de novo
see cybor corp. v. fas techs. inc. 138_f.3d_1448 1455 46_uspq2d_1169 1173 fed.cir.1998 en banc
the second step determination of infringement whether literal or under the doctrine of equivalents is a question of fact
see e.g. north am vaccine inc. v. american cyanamid co. 7_f.3d_1571 1574 28_uspq2d_1333 1335 fed.cir.1993
thus a literal_infringement issue is properly decided upon summary_judgment when no genuine_issue of material_fact exists in particular when no reasonable_jury could find that every limitation recited in the properly construed claim either is or is not found in the accused device
see generally cole 102 f.3d at 532 41 uspq2d at 1007 defining literal_infringement standard

a claim of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents may be decided on summary_judgment
as the supreme_court recently stated where the evidence is such that no reasonable_jury could determine two elements to *1354 be equivalent [ the ] district_court [ is ] obliged to grant partial or complete_summary_judgment.. of course the various legal limitations on the application of the doctrine of equivalents are to be determined by the court.. [ i ] f prosecution_history_estoppel would apply or if a theory of equivalence would entirely vitiate a particular claim element partial or complete_summary_judgment should be rendered by the court as there would be no further material issue for the jury to resolve
warner-jenkinson 520 u.s. at -- -- n. 8 117 s.ct.at 1053_n._8 41 uspq2d at 1875_n._8_(1997)
furthermore whether prosecution_history_estoppel applies to limit the doctrine of equivalents is a question of law that we review de novo
see e.g. southwall techs inc. v. cardinal ig co. 54_f.3d_1570 1579 34_uspq2d_1673 1679 fed.cir.1995
thus when deciding whether summary_judgment of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents is proper we may first determine whether prosecution_history_estoppel applies i.e. whether an aspect of the originally claimed subject_matter was surrendered by the amendment and is thus outside the range of equivalents to which the patentee is entitled
see e.g. wang labs. inc. v. mitsubishi elecs. 103_f.3d_1571 1578 41_uspq2d_1263 1269 fed.cir.1997
if we conclude that prosecution_history_estoppel does not apply we may then determine whether a reasonable_jury could find that the accused device contains elements that are equivalent to each of the properly construed claim_limitations
see warner-jenkinson 520 u.s. at -- -- 117 s.ct.at 1049 41 uspq2d at 1871

appellant bai does not essentially challenge the courts claim_construction
the only issues the parties dispute are whether the district_court improperly concluded that claim 1 does not encompass the magic_catch either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents

bai argues that the district_court erred in granting summary_judgment of no literal_infringement
bai maintains that the court adopted a construction of the term` hemispherical' that encompasses devices that are` concave and symmetrical about their center [ s ]' and that no reasonable_jury could find that magic_catch was not so constructed
wings responds that bai misquotes the district_courts construction of the term` hemispherical' and that no reasonable_jury could find that magic_catch literally infringed under the district_courts construction

we agree with wings
while the court did quote bais description of the claimed glove as` concave and symmetrical about its center' the court did not adopt this language as part of its claim_construction
see bai 1997_wl_527870 at *big_token__2_n._3__big_token
instead the court clearly construed the term` hemispherical' to mean` less than a sphere but nevertheless part of a sphere' a construction with which we do not disagree
in addition it is clear from the record that no reasonable fact-finder could describe the shape of the magic_catch_glove as` less than a sphere but nevertheless part of a sphere'
although the magic_catch_glove is round it is uncontested that it is predominately flat with curved edges like a saucer or a frisbee_the_r and is therefore in no sense hemispherical
because no reasonable_jury could find that the magic_catch literally meets the` hemispherical' limitation we conclude that the district_court correctly granted summary_judgment of no literal_infringement
see sage prods. inc. v. devon indus. inc. 126_f.3d_1420 44_uspq2d_1103_(fed.cir.1997)

bai next argues that the district_court erred in granting summary_judgment of noninfringement under the doctrine of equivalents
bai contends that magic_catch infringes the076_patent under the doctrine of equivalents and that prosecution_history_estoppel does not apply
bai maintains that he added the` hemispherical' limitation merely to clarify the structure of the invention
bai argues in the alternative that the warner-jenkinson_presumption does apply and was rebutted by a subsequent interference proceeding in which the interference_examiner determined that the term` hemispherical' was immaterial to the count and thus unrelated to patentability

wings responds that bai clearly added the term` hemispherical' to overcome the prior_art_rejection based on the hartel reference not for clarification
wings argues that bai could not have added that term for clarification because it actually misdescribes the preferred embodiment which does not disclose a half-spherical glove
wings contends that *1355 the interference proceeding is not part of the prosecution_history because the interference was terminated and in any case would not effect the conclusion that bai added the term` hemispherical' to overcome prior_art because the interference_examiner never decided the scope of claim 1

when determining whether prosecution_history_estoppel applies to limit the doctrine of equivalents a court must examine the reason why an applicant amended a claim
see warner-jenkinson 520 u.s. at -- -- 117 s.ct.at 1049 137_l.ed.2d_146 41 uspq2d at 1872
if such examination indicates that a patent_applicant has made a substantive change to his claim that clearly responds to an examiners rejection of that claim as unpatentable over prior_art prosecution_history_estoppel applies to that claim ; only the question of the scope of the estoppel remains
no presumption needs to be applied in such a case because the reason for the amendment is clear
warner-jenkinson did not change this aspect of prosecution_history_estoppel
see warner-jenkinson 520 u.s. at -- -- 117 s.ct.at 1049-50 41 uspq2d at 1871-72 citing with approval five supreme_court cases invoking prosecution_history_estoppel where the applicant narrowed his claims in order to overcome a prior_art_rejection

what warner-jenkinson did address was the situation in which the prosecution_history fails to disclose a reason for a claim amendment
in that case the patent_applicant responded to a prior_art_rejection by adding a ph range to his claim
because the examiner cited prior_art relevant to the higher but not the lower end of the range the addition of the upper ph limit clearly responded to the prior_art_rejection but the addition of the lower_ph_limit did not
thus the record did not disclose the reason for the addition of the lower_ph_limit
see warner-jenkinson 520 u.s. at -- -- 117 s.ct.at 1050 137_l.ed.2d_146 41 uspq2d at 1872
the court held that even in the absence of such a disclosed reason it nonetheless should be presumed that the lower_ph_limit was included for a reason related to patentability and thus that prosecution_history_estoppel applied to that claim_limitation unless the patentee could establish that the amendment was not related to patentability
see id. 520 u.s. at -- -- 117 s.ct.at 1051 41 uspq2d at 1873
the meaning of the word` patentability' was not made clear but the context of the courts discussion was patentability over the prior_art

in this case the reason for the` hemispherical' amendment is clear from the record
the examiner made only one rejection ; he stated that the prior_art specifically referring to the hartel_patent which discloses a dish-shaped glove rendered obvious the combination of a target a glove and a dish_shape
bai responded inter alia by adding the limitation` hemispherical' to the glove element
thus the term` hemispherical' was clearly an attempt by bai to differentiate his invention over the hartel_patent
that bai did not specifically address the hartel_patent in his remarks to the examiner does not alter our conclusion because it is clear that the` hemispherical' limitation directly addressed the citation of this reference

bais boilerplate remark to the examiner that he amended his claims to` specifically and expressly recite the structural_details' of his invention does not affect our conclusion
bais assertion that this language somehow conveys to the examiner his intent to add the term` hemispherical' for clarity purposes is unpersuasive
there is no evidence and bai does not argue that there is such evidence that clarity was a problem with his claims
there was no lack of clarity and no rejection under section 112
prior art was the problem
moreover bais remark to the examiner that he amended his claim to recite a` particular_configuration' buttresses our conclusion that the` hemispherical' amendment was a narrowing amendment that served to distinguish that` particular_configuration' over the prior_art
because we conclude that the prosecution_record clearly shows that the reason behind the addition of the` hemispherical' limitation was to overcome prior_art prosecution_history_estoppel conclusively applies
the warner-jenkinson_presumption does not apply because the reason for amendment was readily apparent from the prosecution_record
consequently bais arguments attempting to rebut the application of prosecution_history_estoppel are irrelevant to our analysis

bais argument that the deletion of the term` hemispherical' from the interference *1356 count indicates that the earlier insertion of that term into the claim was not made to overcome a rejection on the ground of unpatentability of the claim is also not persuasive
as indicated above it is clear to us that the term` hemispherical' was inserted to overcome the prior_art_rejection
the subsequent action of the examiner in the interference did not undo that fact
it merely responded to the motion by the opposing party to broaden the count not the claim for purposes of the interference presumably to enable the opponent to present proof of priority with respect to subject_matter broadly defined to encompass interfering subject_matter including that which was not hemispherical
the reformulation of the interference count was therefore not a determination that bais claim was allowable over the prior_art without the term` hemispherical'

bai also argues that the amendment could not have been made to overcome prior_art because it was not necessary to overcome the prior_art_rejection
we disagree
it is now too late in the game for us to analyze whether bais addition of the term` hemispherical' was necessary to gain allowance of his claim
when an applicant disagrees with the examiners prior_art_rejection and fails to prevail by argument he has two choices either to amend the claim or to appeal the rejection
he may not both make the amendment and then challenge its necessity in a subsequent infringement action on the allowed claim
bai made his choice and amended the claim
see warner-jenkinson 520 u.s. at -- -- n. 7 117_s.ct._1040 1051_n._7 41 uspq2d at 1872-big_token__73_n._7_` we_do_not_suggest_that _where_a_change_is_made_to_overcome_an_objection_based_on_the_prior_art _a_court_is_free_to_review_the_correctness_of_that_objection_when_deciding_whether_to_apply_prosecution_history_estoppel.._ [ s ] uch_concerns_are_properly_addressed_on_direct_appeal_from_the_denial_of_a_patent _and_will_not_be_revisited_in_an_infringement_action' __big_token
a patentee does not have a second chance to relitigate the merits of a prior_art_rejection that caused an amendment to be made to gain allowance of the claims
we therefore refuse to speculate as to whether the examiner would have found claim 1 to be allowable over the prior_art if bai had not added the term` hemispherical' to the claim
whether or not the` hemispherical' limitation was superfluous the prosecution_record clearly reveals that bai made this amendment to overcome prior_art
see american permahedge v. barcana 105_f.3d_1441 1446 41_uspq2d_1614 1618 fed.cir.1997` [ c ] lear assertions made during prosecution in support of patentability whether or not actually required to secure allowance may create an estoppel
``

the remaining issue is the scope of estoppel
the district_court concluded that prosecution_history_estoppel limited_bai to products that are hemispherical in shape and held that magic_catch thus did not infringe claim 1
see bai 1997_wl_527870 at *5
we agree with the district_court that magic_catch does not fall within any scope of equivalents to which bai is entitled under the076_patent
a patentee is estopped from recovering through equivalency that which was deemed unpatentable in view of prior_art
see litton sys. inc. v. honeywell inc. 140_f.3d_1449 1462 46_uspq2d_1321 1330 fed.cir.1998
an applicant who responds to an examiners prior_art_rejection by narrowing his claim can not later assert that the surrendered subject_matter is an equivalent of the amended limitation
see id
the saucer-shaped subject_matter surrendered by insertion of the term` hemispherical' is precisely that which bai needs to recover in order to encompass the magic_catch within the instant claim
bai is thus estopped from asserting that magic_catch infringes under the doctrine of equivalents
because prosecution_history_estoppel precludes bais application of the doctrine of equivalents we affirm the district_courts holding that the magic_catch does not infringe claim 1 of the076_patent under that theory

conclusion
because the trial court properly granted summary_judgment of noninfringement we

affirm
