opinion
clevenger circuit_judge
this is a patent infringement suit brought by amazon.com inc.` amazon' against barnesandnoble.com inc. and barnesandnoble.com llc together` bn'
amazon moved for a preliminary_injunction to prohibit bns use of a feature of its web_site called` express_lane'
bn resisted *1347 the preliminary_injunction on several grounds including that its express_lane_feature did not infringe the claims of amazons patent and that substantial_questions exist as to the validity of amazons patent
the united_states_district_court for the western_district of washington rejected bns contentions
instead the district_court held that amazon had presented a case showing a likelihood of infringement by bn and that bns challenges to the validity of the patent in suit lacked sufficient merit to avoid awarding extraordinary preliminary injunctive relief to amazon
the district_court granted amazons motion and now bn brings its timely appeal from the order entering the preliminary_injunction
we have jurisdiction to review the district_courts order under 28 u.s.c.¡± 1292 c 1 1994

after careful review of the district_courts opinion the record and the arguments advanced by the parties we conclude that bn has mounted a substantial_challenge to the validity of the patent in suit
because amazon is not entitled to preliminary injunctive relief under these circumstances we vacate the order of the district_court that set the preliminary_injunction in place and remand the case for further_proceedings

i
this case involves united_states_patent_no._5960,411` the ¡¬411_patent` which issued on september 28 1999 and is assigned to amazon
on october 21 1999 amazon brought suit against bn alleging infringement of the patent and seeking a preliminary_injunction

amazons patent is directed to a method and system for` single_action' ordering of items in a client/server_environment such as the internet
in the context of the ¡¬411_patent a client/server_environment describes the relationship between two computer systems in which a program executing on a client_computer_system makes a service_request from another program executing on a server_computer_system which fulfills the request
see col._1,_ll._10-31 ; col._3,_ll._31-33 ; col._5,_l._56 to col._6,_l._21 ; fig._2
typically the client_computer_system and the server_computer_system are located remotely from each other and communicate via a data communication network

the ¡¬411_patent describes a method and system in which a consumer can complete a purchase_order for an item via an electronic network using only a` single_action' such as the click of a computer mouse button on the client_computer_system
amazon developed the patent to cope with what it considered to be frustrations presented by what is known as the` shopping_cart_model' purchase system for electronic commerce purchasing events
in previous incarnations of the shopping_cart_model a purchaser using a client_computer_system such as a personal computer executing a web browser program could select an item from an electronic catalog typically by clicking on an` add to shopping_cart' icon thereby placing the item in the` virtual' shopping_cart
other items from the catalog could be added to the shopping_cart in the same manner
when the shopper completed the selecting process the electronic commercial event would move to the check-out counter so to speak
then information regarding the purchasers identity billing and shipping addresses and credit payment method would be inserted into the transactional information base by the soon-to-be purchaser
finally the purchaser would` click' on a button displayed on the screen or somehow issue a command to execute the completed order and the server_computer_system would verify and store the information concerning the transaction

as is evident from the foregoing an electronic commerce purchaser using the shopping_cart_model is required to perform *1348 several actions before achieving the ultimate goal of the placed_order
the ¡¬411_patent sought to reduce the number of actions required from a consumer to effect a placed_order
in the words of the written description of the ¡¬411_patent the present_invention provides a method and system for single-action_ordering of items in a client/server_environment
the single-action_ordering system of the present_invention reduces the number of purchaser_interactions needed to place an order and reduces the amount of sensitive_information that is transmitted between a client_system and a server_system
col._3,_ll._31-37
how one may ask is the number of purchaser_interactions reduced ?
the answer is that the number of purchaser_interactions is reduced because the purchaser has previously visited the sellers web_site and has previously entered into the database of the seller all of the required billing and shipping_information that is needed to effect a sales transaction
thereafter when the purchaser visits the sellers web_site and wishes to purchase a product from that site the patent specifies that only a single_action is necessary to place the order for the item
in the words of the written description` once the description of an item is displayed the purchaser need only take a single_action to place the order to purchase that item'
col._3,_ll._64-66

ii
the ¡¬411_patent has 26 claims 4 of which are independent
independent claims 1_and_11 are method claims directed to placing an order for an item while independent_claim 6 is an apparatus_claim directed to a client_system for ordering an item and independent_claim 9 is an apparatus_claim directed to a server_system for generating an order
amazon asserted claims 1-3 5-12 14-17 and 21-24 against bn
although there are significant differences among the various independent and dependent claims in issue for purposes of this appeal we may initially direct our primary focus on the` single_action' limitation that is included in each claim
this focus is appropriate because bns appeal attacks the injunction on the grounds that either its accused method does not infringe the` single_action' limitation present in all of the claims that the` single_action' feature of the patent is invalid or both

we set forth below the text of the claims pertinent to our deliberations i.e. claims 1 2 6 9 and 11 with emphasis added to highlight the disputed claim terms 1
a method of placing an order for an item_comprising under control of a client_system displaying information identifying the item ; and in response to only a single_action being performed sending a request to order the item along with an identifier of a purchaser of the item to a server_system ; under control of a single-action_ordering component of the server_system receiving the request ; retrieving additional_information previously stored for the purchaser identified by the identifier in the received request ; and generating an order to purchase the requested item for the purchaser identified by the identifier in the received request using the retrieved additional_information ; and fulfilling the generated order to complete purchase of the item whereby the item is ordered without using a shopping_cart_ordering_model
2
the method of claim 1 wherein the displaying of information includes displaying information indicating the single_action

.
.
.
.
.
6
a client_system for ordering an item_comprising an identifier that *1349 identifies a customer ; a display_component for displaying information identifying the item ; a single-action_ordering component that in response to performance of only a single_action sends a request to a server_system to order the identified_item the request including the identifier so that the server_system can locate additional_information needed to complete the order and so that the server_system can fulfill the generated order to complete purchase of the item ; and
a shopping_cart ordering component that in response to performance of an add-to-shopping-cart action sends a request to the server_system to add the item to a shopping_cart

.
.
.
.
.
9
a server_system for generating an order comprising a shopping_cart ordering component ; and
a single-action_ordering component including a data storage medium storing information for a plurality of users ; a receiving component for receiving requests to order an item a request including an indication of one of the plurality of users the request being sent in response to only a single_action being performed ; and
an order placement component that retrieves from the data storage medium information for the indicated user and that uses the retrieved information to place an order for the indicated user for the item ; and an order_fulfillment_component that completes a purchase of the item in accordance with the order placed by the single-action_ordering component

.
.
.
.
.
11
a method for ordering an item using a client_system the method comprising displaying information identifying the item and displaying an indication of a single_action that is to be performed to order the identified_item ; and
in response to only the indicated single_action being performed sending to a server_system a request to order the identified_item
whereby the item is ordered independently of a shopping_cart_model and the order is fulfilled to complete a purchase of the item

the district_court interpreted the key` single_action' claim_limitation which appears in each of the pertinent claims to mean the term` single_action' is not defined by the patent_specification.. as a result the term` single_action' as used in the ¡¬411_patent appears to refer to one action such as clicking a mouse button that a user takes to purchase an item once the following information is displayed to the user 1 a description of the item ; and 2 a description of the single_action the user must take to complete a purchase_order for that item
with this interpretation of the key claim_limitation in hand the district_court turned to bns accused ordering system
bns short-cut ordering system called` express_lane' like the system contemplated by the patent contains previously entered billing and shipping_information for the customer
in one implementation after a person is presented with bns initial web_page referred to as the` menu_page' or` home page' the person can click on an icon on the menu_page to get to what is called the` product_page'
bns product_page displays an image and a description of the selected product and also presents the person with a description of a single_action that can be taken to complete a purchase_order for the item
if the single_action described is taken for example by a mouse click the person will have effected a *1350 purchase_order using bns express_lane_feature

bns express_lane thus presents a product_page that contains the description of the item to be purchased and a` description' of the single_action to be taken to effect placement of the order
because only a single_action need be taken to complete the purchase_order once the product_page is displayed the district_court concluded that amazon had made a showing of likelihood of success on its allegation of patent infringement

in response to bns contention that substantial_questions exist as to the validity of the ¡¬411_patent the district_court reviewed the prior_art_references upon which bns validity_challenge rested
the district_court concluded that none of the prior_art_references anticipated the claims of the ¡¬ 411 patent under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 1994 or rendered the claimed invention obvious under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 1994

iii
the grant or denial of a preliminary_injunction under 35 u.s.c.¡± 283 1994 is within the sound discretion of the district_court

`` an abuse of discretion may be established by showing that the court made a clear_error of judgment in weighing relevant_factors or exercised its discretion based upon an error of law or clearly erroneous_factual_findings'

as the moving party amazon is entitled to a preliminary_injunction if it can succeed in showing 1 a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits ; 2 irreparable_harm if an injunction is not granted ; 3 a balance of hardships tipping in its favor ; and 4 the injunctions favorable impact on the public interest

`` this presumption derives in part from the finite term of the patent grant for patent expiration is not suspended during litigation and the passage of time can work irremediable harm'
id

our case law and logic both require that a movant can not be granted a preliminary_injunction unless it establishes both of the first two factors i.e. likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable_harm

in order to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits amazon must show that in light of the presumptions and burdens that will inhere at trial on the merits 1 amazon will likely prove that bn infringes the ¡¬411_patent and 2 amazons infringement_claim will likely withstand bns challenges to the validity and enforceability of the ¡¬411_patent
genentech inc. v. novo_nordisk a/s 108_f.3d_1361 1364 42_uspq2d_1001 1003 fed.cir.1997
if bn raises a substantial_question concerning either infringement or validity i.e. asserts an infringement or invalidity defense that the patentee can not *1351 prove` lacks substantial merit' the preliminary_injunction should not issue
id

of course whether performed at the preliminary_injunction_stage or at some later stage in the course of a particular case infringement and validity_analyses must be performed on a claim-by-claim basis
see e.g. bayer ag v. elan pharm
research corp. 212_f.3d_1241 1247 54_uspq2d_1711 1715 fed.cir.2000` literal infringement requires the patentee to prove that the accused device contains each limitation of the asserted claim s'
( citations omitted ; ortho pharm corp. v. smith 959_f.2d_936 942 22_uspq2d_1119 1124 fed.cir.1992 concluding that all grounds of invalidity must be evaluated against individual claims as required by the plain_language of 35 u.s.c.¡± 282 1994
therefore in cases involving multiple patent claims to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits the patentee must demonstrate that it will likely prove infringement of one or more claims of the patents-in-suit and that at least one of those same allegedly infringed claims will also likely withstand the validity_challenges presented by the accused infringer

both infringement and validity are at issue in this appeal
it is well settled that an infringement_analysis involves two steps the claim scope is first determined and then the properly construed claim is compared with the accused device to determine whether all of the claim_limitations are present either literally or by a substantial equivalent
see e.g. young dental mfg co. v. q3 special prods. inc. 112_f.3d_1137 1141 42_uspq2d_1589 1592 fed.cir.1997
conceptually the first_step of an invalidity_analysis based on anticipation and/or obviousness in view of prior_art_references is no different from that of an infringement_analysis
`` it is elementary in patent law that in determining whether a patent is valid and if valid infringed the first_step is to determine the meaning and scope of each claim in suit'
lemelson v. gen. mills inc. 968_f.2d_1202 1206 23_uspq2d_1284 1287 fed.cir.1992
`` a claim must be construed before determining its validity just as it is first construed before deciding infringement'

only when a claim is properly understood can a determination be made whether the claim` reads on' an accused device or method or whether the prior_art anticipates and/or renders obvious the claimed invention
see id
because the claims of a patent measure the invention at issue the claims must be interpreted and given the same meaning for purposes of both validity and infringement analyses

the court must properly interpret the claims because an improper claim construction may distort the infringement and validity_analyses

iv
bn contends on appeal that the district_court committed legal errors that undermine the legitimacy of the preliminary_injunction
in particular bn asserts that the district_court construed key_claim_limitations one way for purposes of its infringement_analysis and another way when considering bns validity_challenges
*1352 bn asserts that under a consistent claim_interpretation its express_lane_feature either does not infringe the ¡¬411_patent or that if the patent is interpreted so as to support the charge of infringement then the claims of the patent are subject to a severe validity_challenge
when the key_claim_limitations are properly interpreted bn thus asserts it will be clear that amazon is not likely to succeed on the merits of its infringement_claim or that bn has succeeded in calling the validity of the ¡¬411_patent into serious question
in addition bn asserts that the district_court misunderstood the teaching of the prior_art_references thereby committing clear_error in the factual predicates it established for comprehension of the prior_art_references

amazon understandably aligns itself with the district_court asserting that no error of claim_interpretation and no clear_error in fact-finding has occurred that would undermine the grant of the preliminary_injunction
we thus turn to the legal gist of this appeal

v. it is clear from the district_courts opinion that the meaning it ascribed to the` single_action' limitation includes a temporal consideration
the` single_action' to be taken to complete the purchase_order according to the district_court only occurs after other events have transpired
these preliminary events required pursuant to the district_courts claim_interpretation are the presentation of a description of the item to be purchased and the presentation of the single_action the user must take to complete the purchase_order for the item

amazon defends this temporal interpretation based on statements made by the applicant during prosecution of the patent
these statements set forth below are significant because they were made at the point in the file_history where the claims were amended to include the single_action_limitation

in remarks accompanying an amendment dated february 26 1999 amazon provided the following comments not limited to specific claims to explain proposed amendments to the claims and to` clarify that the claimed single-action_ordering_technology is different from the shopping_cart metaphor' applicants single_action_ordering_technology facilitates electronic ordering of items by reducing the number of purchaser_interactions needed to place an order and reducing the amount of sensitive_information that is transmitted between a client computer and a server computer when placing an order
to order an item using single-action_ordering_technology the purchaser first locates the item by browsing through a catalog of items by searching for the item by selecting a link to the item or by using any other_means for locating the item
once the item is located the purchaser need only perform a single_action to generate an order for the item and to fulfill that generated order
the single_action may be for example the selecting of a button that is displayed on the web_page or the speaking of a command
because information e.g. billing and shipping about the purchaser has been saved e.g. from a previous purchase that information can be combined with the identification of the located item to generate and fulfill an order when the single_action is performed

on its face this passage from the file_history establishes that once a purchaser has located an item by any means only a single_action is required to generate an order for the item
amazon however would put a special reading on the concept of a purchaser locating an item by any means
in amazons view of the file_history a purchaser has not located the item for the purpose of counting the number of steps thereafter to generate the order until the purchaser has made the decision to *1353 purchase the item
as applied to the present case amazon argues that display of information about an item on bns menu_page does not indicate an item located with an intent to place the order ; only after one moves from bns menu_page to its product_page has one` located' the item for purposes of placing the order by a single_action
since it only takes a single_action on bns product_page to place the order amazon contends that bn likely infringes the ¡¬411_patent

amazons reading of the key passage from the file_history injects subjective notions into the infringement_analysis
for example if a would-be purchaser has made the decision to purchase an item before coming to bns menu_page and there the purchaser sees the item displayed amazon would have to concede that no single_action taken after the item display would achieve placement of the order
instead the purchaser would need to take a first action to advance from the menu_page to the product_page and then a second_action to place the order
we are not prepared to assign a meaning to a patent claim that depends on the state of mind of the accused infringer
we thus reject amazons special meaning for the location of an item to be purchased

however as we now discuss in detail we ultimately agree with amazon and construe all four independent_claims i.e. claims 1 6 9 and 11 to call for the single_action to be performed immediately after a display of information about an item and without any intervening action but not necessarily immediately after the first_display or every display

our analysis begins with the plain_language of the claims themselves
the term` single_action' appears in the independent_claims of the ¡¬411_patent in the following forms` in response to only a single_action being performed' claims 1_and_9` single-action_ordering component' claims 1 6 and 9` in response to performance of only a single_action' claim 6` in response to only the indicated single_action being performed' claim 11 and` displaying an indication of a single_action that is to be performed to order the identified_item' claim 11

in claims 1 6 and 11 the context of the claim makes it clear that the single_action is performed after some information about the item is displayed
claim 1 provides for` displaying information identifying the item' and then immediately recites that` in response to only a single_action being performed' a request to purchase the item is sent to a server_system
claim 6 provides for` a display_component for displaying information identifying the item' and then immediately recites` the single_action_ordering component that in response to performance of only a single_action' sends a request to purchase the item to a server_system
claim 11 provides for` displaying information identifying the item and displaying an indication of the single_action' and then immediately recites that` in response to only the indicated single_action being performed' a request to purchase the item is sent to a server_system
the context also indicates that the single_action is performed or is capable of being performed after information about the item is displayed without any intervening action
nothing suggests however that the single_action must be performed after every display or even immediately after the first_display of information
claim 9 does not explicitly provide for displaying information
it merely recites that a request to order an item is` sent in response to only a single_action being performed'
however although claim 9 does not recite` displaying' the written description defines the claim 9 language of` single_action being performed' to require that information has been displayed

the ordinary_meaning of` single_action' as used in the various claims is straightforward *1354 but the phrase alone does not indicate when to start counting actions
therefore we must look first to the written description of the ¡¬411_patent for further guidance

the written description supports a construction that after information is` displayed' single-action_ordering is an option available to the user and the counting falls within the scope of the claim when single-action_ordering is actually selected by the user
to the extent that the claims are considered ambiguous on this point the written description defines` single_action' to require as much
in the summary of the invention the written description describes an embodiment that` displays information that identifies the item and displays an indication of an action.. [ and ] [ i ] n response to the indicated action being performed' orders the item
col._2,_ll._54-59
similarly in the detailed_description of the invention the written description states that` [ o ] nce the description of an item is displayed the purchaser need only take a single_action'
col._3,_ll._65-66
this is consistent for all of the disclosed embodiments

therefore neither the written description nor the plain meaning of the claims require that single_action_ordering be possible after each and every display of information or even immediately after the first_display of information
the plain_language of the claims and the written description require only that single_action_ordering be possible after some display of information
indeed the written description allows for and suggests the possibility that previous displays of information will have occurred before the display immediately preceding an order

the detailed_description of the invention describes the first figure fig.1a by stating that` this example web page [ containing a summary description of the item ] was sent.. when the purchaser requested to review detailed_information about the item'
col._4,_ll._7-9 emphasis added
given that the written description earlier described on-line purchasing as involving` browsing' col.1 l.55 it is reasonable to conclude that some less detailed_information about the item has already been displayed

this passage also allows for the possibility that the purchaser sees a display of the less detailed_information on an item decides to browse elsewhere then ultimately returns to obtain more detailed_information on the item and to finally order it
thus there could be intermittent displays of information on an item in addition to successive displays of information on an item and each and every display need not have single_action_ordering capability

the above passages indicate that the written description is not concerned with what happens on every display of information or even immediately after the first_display but only that there be some display from which single_action_ordering can be performed

the prosecution_history of the ¡¬411_patent also supports the above claim construction
in response to an office action in the passage from the prosecution_history cited earlier in this opinion the patentee stated` a purchaser first locates the item [ 1 ] by browsing through a catalog of items [ 2 ] by searching for the item [ 3 ] by selecting a link to the item or [ 4 ] by using any other_means for locating the item
once the item is located the purchaser need only perform a single_action to generate an order' enumeration added
this enumeration of the various ways an item may be located allows for information on the item to be displayed prior to single_action_ordering being enabled
this is seen most clearly in the third enumerated method` selecting a link to the item'
if it is to serve as` a link to the item' emphasis added then there must be some display of *1355 information on the item either in the link or around the link
thus information on the item may sometimes be displayed before` locating' the item and hence before single_action_ordering is enabled

likewise the first enumerated method browsing is explained in the written description to entail requesting` detailed_information' about an item before single_action_ordering is enabled
this presumes that` un-detailed' or general information was previously displayed
similarly the second enumerated method searching commonly entails first_displaying information on various items that match a search string such as a list of all books written by a particular author or dealing with a particular subject
the purchaser than typically selects one of these items to receive more detailed_information at which point the selected item is presumably` located' and single_action_ordering is enabled

vi
a
when the correct meaning of the single_action_limitation is read on the accused bn system it becomes apparent that the limitations of claim 1 are likely met by the accused system
the evidence on the record concerning the operation of bns` express_lane' feature is not in dispute
at the time that the ¡¬411_patent was issued bn offered customers two purchasing options
one was called` shopping_cart' and the other was called` express_lane'
the shopping_cart option involved the steps of adding items to a` virtual' shopping_cart and then` checking out' to complete the purchase
in contrast the express_lane option allowed customers who had registered for the feature to purchase items simply by` clicking' on the` express_lane' button provided on the` detail page' or` product_page' describing and identifying the book or other item to be purchased
the text beneath the express_lane button invited users to` buy it now with just 1 click !'

bns allegedly infringing web_site thus may be characterized as having` page 1' the` menu' page which displays a catalog listing several items but which does not contain an` order' icon and` page 2' the` product' or` detail' page which includes information on one item and also shows an order icon
someone shopping at this web_site would look at the catalog on page 1 and perform a first click to go to page 2
once at page 2 a second click on the ordering icon would cause the order_request to be sent
under the claim construction set forth herein bn likely infringes claim 1 because on page 2 the item is there displayed meeting_step 1 of the claim and only a single_action thereafter causes the order_request to be transmitted meeting_step 2
the method implemented on page 1 of the bn web_site does not infringe but the method on page 2 does
this has nothing to do with the state of mind of the purchaser but simply reflects the ordinary_meaning of the words of the claim in the context of the written description and in light of the prosecution_history

we recognize that under this construction claim 1 would appear to read on the prior_art shopping_cart_model because the final page of a shopping_cart_model both displays the item to be purchased in a list of selected products and sends the order_request signal in response to the single next action of clicking on the` confirm purchase' icon
however the shopping_cart_model is expressly excluded from claim 1 by the whereby clause at the end of the claim

we note that the district_court concluded that` [ b ] arnesandnoble.com infringes claims 1 2 3 5 11 12 12 14 15 16 17 21 22 23 [ and ] 24' and` also infringes claims 6-10 of the ¡¬411_patent'
however the relevant determination at *1356 the preliminary_injunction_stage is substantial_likelihood of success by amazon of its infringement_claims not a legal conclusion as to the ultimate issue of infringement
we therefore interpret the district_courts conclusions as determining that amazon had demonstrated a substantial_likelihood of establishing literal infringement of the enumerated claims

b
according to the plain_language of claim 2 the point of reference from which to start` counting clicks' does not begin until` information indicating the single_action' to be performed is displayed i.e. when the` express lane' or` buy now' button is displayed
amazon is thus correct in its assertion that only a single_action is required after that point to send a request to order an item using bns express_lane_feature
for this reason we can not say that bn raised a substantial_question of noninfringement of claim 2 in the ¡¬ 411 patent with respect to the` single_action' limitation at this stage in the litigation

we point out that bn mounted an additional_noninfringement_argument with respect to claims 1 2 and 11 based on the term` shopping_cart_model' in the` whereby' clause of those claims
claims 1_and_2 require that the item be ordered` without using a shopping_cart_model'
similarly claim 11 requires that the item be ordered` independently of a shopping_cart_model'
thus according to bn even if an ordering system accused of infringement used the claimed` single_action' technology it would still not infringe claims 1 2 or 11 so long as the single_action_technology was used within the paradigm of a` shopping_cart_model'

accordingly bn argues that even if its express_lane_feature is said to use single_action_technology within the scope of the claims in the ¡¬411_patent the express_lane_feature is nevertheless a` shopping_cart_model' because according to the written description` shopping_cart_model' should be construed to include models in which checkout happens automatically when an item is selected for purchase
in fact the written description of the ¡¬411_patent does mention alternative prior_art shopping_cart_models having the feature that` when a purchaser selects any one item then that item ischecked out by automatically prompting the user for the billing and shipment information'
col._2,_ll._24-27
thus bn argues that its express_lane system does not infringe because it is an embodiment of such an alternative shopping_cart_model admitted to be prior_art in the written description of the ¡¬411_patent

the district_court construed` shopping_cart_model' to mean` a method for on-line ordering in which a user selects and accumulates items to be purchased while browsing a merchants site and then must proceed to one or more checkout or confirmation_steps in order to complete the purchase'
bn argues that this interpretation contradicts the written description of the ¡¬411_patent because it allegedly excludes the alternative_shopping_cart_models mentioned in the written description
however we discern no error with the district_courts interpretation of` shopping_cart_model' because it is consistent with the written description and with the comments made by amazon discussing the term during prosecution of the ¡¬411_patent as discussed earlier with reference to the` single_action' limitation
the district_courts interpretation does not improperly exclude the alternative_shopping_cart_models mentioned by bn because although an item may be checked out automatically when using these alternative_shopping_cart_models the written description states that the user must still provide billing and shipping_information unless the information is` pre-filled' with information that was provided by the user when placing a previous *1357 order
additionally regardless of whether the` purchaser-specific order information' is pre-filled or not the user must still perform at least one confirmation_step once the purchaser is presented with the order web_page to complete the purchase
see col._2,_ll._24-36
it follows then that bns noninfringement argument based on characterizing its express_lane_feature as a` shopping_cart_model' fails because once a purchaser clicks on the` express_lane' ordering button no additional checkout or confirmation_steps are required before a request to order the item is sent to the server_system

having considered and rejected bns alternative noninfringement arguments we find that amazon has carried its merits burden with respect to likely infringement of claim 2
we note there is some redundancy between claims 1_and_2 under the claim_interpretation set forth herein
however the two claims are not identical in scope
for example claim 2 would not read on a method where the first page of a web_site includes a textual message such as` click directly on the picture of any item displayed on any of the following pages to place an order'
under such a method there would never be a page where both the item and the single_action to be taken to order the item would be displayed
claim 2 would not be infringed by such a system but claim 1 would

c. we note further that amazon has also made out its likelihood of success case with respect to infringement of claim 11
claim 11 is similar to claim 2 because it also includes the limitation requiring` displaying an indication of a single_action that is to be performed'
for the reasons noted above with respect to claim 2 the district_court was correct in concluding that bn had not raised a substantial_question of noninfringement regarding claim 11

d. in view of our interpretation of` single_action' we find that the district_court correctly concluded that bn had not raised a substantial_question of noninfringement regarding claims 6_and_9 with respect to the` single_action' limitation

however we note that bn also mounted an additional_noninfringement_argument with respect to claims 6_and_9 based on the terms` fulfill' and` fulfillment' in those claims
claim 6 requires that the server_system have the capability to` fulfill the generated order to complete purchase of the item'
similarly claim 9 requires that the single_action_ordering component of the server_system must include` an order_fulfillment_component that completes a purchase of the item'
bn argues that` fulfill' and` fulfillment' refer to all of the steps required to pick the product from a warehouse_shelf pack it for shipment and ship it to the customer
presumably bn believes that such an interpretation would lead to noninfringement of claims 6_and_9 at least under a theory of direct infringement

the district_court ruled that the various forms of` fulfill' throughout the claims refer to order fulfillment_application_software executing on the server_system as opposed to the physical steps of handling or packing tangible items
we discern no error with this interpretation
as bn admits the plain_language of claims 6_and_9 require that the fulfillment steps be capable of being performed by the server_system as in claim 6 and that the order_fulfillment_component be part of the server_system as in claim 9
obviously a server_system as the term is used in the ¡¬411_patent to refer to a computer system see e.g. col._1,_ll._15-16 is incapable of picking a product from a warehouse_shelf packing it for shipment and shipping it to the customer
therefore the terms` fulfill' and its cognates are properly limited to *1358 refer to order fulfillment_application_software executed on the server_system

e. after full review of the record before us we conclude that under a proper claim_interpretation amazon has made the showing that it is likely to succeed at trial on its infringement case
given that we conclude that amazon has demonstrated likely_literal_infringement of at least the four independent_claims in the ¡¬411_patent we need not consider infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
the question remaining however is whether the district_court correctly determined that bn failed to mount a substantial_challenge to the validity of the claims in the ¡¬411_patent

vii
the district_court considered but ultimately rejected the potentially invalidating impact of several prior_art_references cited by bn
because the district_court determined that bn likely infringed all of the asserted claims it did not focus its analysis of the validity_issue on any particular claim
instead in its validity analysis the district_court appears to have primarily directed its attention to determining whether the references cited by bn implemented the single_action_limitation

at the preliminary_injunction_stage of the litigation the district_court sits to deliver an equitable determination and issues of fact naturally play into the final judgment of the district_court
for example in an invalidity_analysis the district_court must assess the meaning of the prior_art_references cited to support the validity_challenge
however what a reference teaches is a question of fact
in re beattie 974_f.2d_1309 1311 24_uspq2d_1040 1041-42 fed.cir.1992
consequently the district_court necessarily makes fact-findings explicitly or implicitly concerning the meaning of the asserted references
on the basis of the district_courts reading of the references it makes judgments as to the validity of the patent in suit
we review the district_courts assessment of the prior_art_references for clear_error
see id
; novo_nordisk 77 f.3d at 1367 37 uspq2d at 1775 fed.cir.1996 stating that an abuse of discretion in granting a preliminary_injunction may be established by showing that the court made a clear_error of judgment in weighing relevant_factors or exercised its discretion based upon an error of law or clearly erroneous_factual_findings

in this case we find that the district_court committed clear_error by misreading the factual content of the prior_art_references cited by bn and by failing to recognize that bn had raised a substantial_question of invalidity of the asserted claims in view of these prior_art_references

validity challenges during preliminary_injunction_proceedings can be successful that is they may raise substantial_questions of invalidity on evidence that would not suffice to support a judgment of invalidity at trial
see e.g. helifix ltd. v. blok-lok ltd. 208_f.3d_1339 1352 54_uspq2d_1299 1308 fed.cir.2000 holding that the allegedly anticipatory_prior_art_references sufficiently raised a question of invalidity to deny a preliminary_injunction even though summary_judgment of anticipation based on the same references was not supported
the test for invalidity at trial is by evidence that is clear and convincing
wms gaming inc. v. int l game tech. 184_f.3d_1339 1355 51_uspq2d_1385 1396-97 fed.cir.1999
to succeed with a summary_judgment_motion of invalidity for example the movant must demonstrate a lack of genuine dispute about material facts and show that the facts not in dispute are clear and convincing in demonstrating *1359 invalidity
robotic vision sys. inc. v. view eng g inc. 112_f.3d_1163 1165 42_uspq2d_1619 1621 fed.cir.1997
in resisting a preliminary_injunction however one need not make out a case of actual invalidity
vulnerability is the issue at the preliminary_injunction_stage while validity is the issue at trial
the showing of a substantial_question as to invalidity thus requires less proof than the clear and convincing showing necessary to establish invalidity itself
that this is so is plain from our cases

when moving for the extraordinary relief of a preliminary_injunction a patentee need not establish the validity of a patent beyond question
atlas powder co. v. ireco chems. 773 f.2d 1230 1233 227_uspq_289 292 fed.cir.1985
the patentee must however present a clear_case supporting the validity of the patent in suit
see nutrition 21 v. united_states 930_f.2d_867 871 18_uspq2d_1347 1349 fed.cir.1991
such a case might be supported for example by showing that the patent in suit had successfully withstood previous validity_challenges in other proceedings
further support for such a clear_case might come from a long period of industry acquiescence in the patents validity
see 7 donald s. chisum chisum on patents ¡± 20.04 [ 1 ] [ c ] at 20-big_token__673_to_20__big_token -693 1998 citing cases
neither of those considerations benefit amazon in this case however because the ¡¬411_patent has yet to be tested by trial and it was issued only a few weeks before the start of this litigation

in helifix we recently confronted the situation in which a district_court had granted a motion of summary_judgment of invalidity based on allegedly anticipatory_prior_art_references and shortly thereafter denied a motion for a preliminary_injunction based on a validity_challenge using the same prior_art_references
208 f.3d at 1344-45 54 uspq2d at 1302
on appeal the patentee sought reversal of the summary_judgment and claimed entitlement to a preliminary_injunction
we held that the summary_judgment could not stand because disputed issues of material fact on invalidity remained for resolution at trial
id.at 208_f.3d_1352 54_uspq2d_1308
nonetheless we expressly held that the quantum of evidence put forth-while falling short of demonstrating invalidity itself-was sufficient to prevent issuance of the preliminary_injunction
id
particularly instructive for purposes of this case is the treatment of the anticipation issue in helifix
a particular reference which did not on its face disclose all the limitations of the claim in suit was argued to be anticipatory even though there was a conflict in the testimony as to whether the reference would have taught one of ordinary_skill in the art the claim_limitations not expressly stated on the face of the reference
although insufficient to demonstrate invalidity for the purposes of the summary_judgment_motion the reference was enough to prevent issuance of the preliminary_injunction
id.at 208_f.3d_1351 -52 54 uspq2d at 1307-08

the situation before us is similar
here we have several references that were urged upon the court as invalidating the asserted claims
the district_court dismissed those references for purposes of its invalidity_analysis because it did not perceive them to recite each and every limitation of the claims in suit
as we explain below in our review of the asserted prior_art in this case each of the asserted references clearly teaches key limitations of the claims of the patent in suit
bn argued to the district_court that one of ordinary_skill in the art could fill in the gaps in the asserted references given the opportunity to do so at trial

when the heft of the asserted prior_art is assessed in light of the correct legal standards we conclude that bn has *1360 mounted a serious_challenge to the validity of amazons patent
we hasten to add however that this conclusion only undermines the prerequisite for entry of a preliminary_injunction
our decision today on the validity_issue in no way resolves the ultimate question of invalidity
that is a matter for resolution at trial
it remains to be learned whether there are other references that may be cited against the patent and it surely remains to be learned whether any shortcomings in bns initial preliminary validity_challenge will be magnified or dissipated at trial
all we hold in the meantime is that bn cast enough doubt on the validity of the ¡¬411_patent to avoid a preliminary_injunction and that the validity_issue should be resolved finally at trial

a
one of the references cited by bn was the` compuserve trend system'
the undisputed_evidence indicates that in the mid-1990s compuserve offered a service called` trend' whereby compuserve subscribers could obtain stock_charts for a surcharge of 50 cents per chart
before the district_court bn argued that this system anticipated claim 11 of the ¡¬411_patent
the district_court failed to recognize the substantial_question of invalidity raised by bn in citing the compuserve_trend_reference in that this system appears to have used` single_action_ordering_technology' within the scope of the claims in the ¡¬411_patent

first the district_court dismissed the significance of this system partly on the basis that` [ t ] he compuserve system was not a world wide web application'
this distinction is irrelevant since none of the claims mention either the internet or the world_wide_web with the possible exception of dependent claim 15 which mentions html a program commonly associated with both the internet and the world_wide_web
moreover the ¡¬411_patent_specification explicitly notes that` [ o ] ne skilled in the art would appreciate that the single-action_ordering techniques can be used in various environments other than the internet'
col._6,_ll._22-24

more importantly one of the screen shots in the record reproduced below indicates that with the compuserve_trend_system once the` item' to be purchased i.e. a stock_chart has been displayed by typing in a valid_stock_symbol only a single_action i.e. a single mouse click on the button labeled` c_hart $50' is required to obtain immediate electronic delivery i.e.` fulfillment' of the item
once the button labeled` c_hart $50' was activated by a purchaser an electronic version of the requested stock_chart would be transmitted to the purchaser and displayed on the purchasers computer screen and an automatic process to charge the purchasers account 50 cents for the transaction would be initiated
in terms of the language of claims 2_and_11 in the compuserve_trend_system the item to be ordered is` displayed' when the screen echoes back the characters of the stock_symbol typed in by the purchaser before clicking on the ordering button

*1361. ?
the evidence before us indicates that the billing_process for the electronic_stock_chart would not actually commence until the client_system sent a message to the server_system indicating that the electronic_stock_chart had been received at the client_system
in its brief amazon argues that this feature of the compuserve_trend_system amounts to an additional` confirmation_step necessary to complete the ordering process' and that the compuserve_trend_system therefore does not use` single_action' technology within the scope of the claims in the ¡¬411_patent
however all of the claims only require sending a request to order an item in response to performance of only a single_action
in the compuserve_trend_system this requirement is satisfied when a purchaser performs the single_action of` clicking' on the button labeled` c_hart $50'
the claims do not require that the billing_process for the item must also be initiated in response to performance of the single_action
furthermore in the compuserve_trend_system the` action' of sending a message from the client_system to the server_system confirming successful reception of the electronic_stock_chart is performed automatically without user intervention

at oral argument amazons counsel articulated three differences between the compuserve_trend_system and the claimed invention
first amazons counsel repeated the district_courts reasoning and asserted that the compuserve_trend_system is not on the internet or the world_wide_web
as mentioned above the ¡¬ 411 patent_specification indicates that this distinction is irrelevant

second amazons counsel claimed that the compuserve_trend_system was different from the claims of the ¡¬411_patent because it required a user to` log in' at the beginning of each session and therefore would not send the claimed` identifier' along with a request to purchase each item
however claim 11 does not require transmission of an identifier along with a request to order an item
this requirement *1362 is found only in claims 1 6 and 9 and their respective dependent claims

on its face the compuserve_trend_reference does not mention transmission of the claimed identifier along with a request to purchase each item
nor does the evidence in the record at this stage indicate that the compuserve_trend_system transmitted such an identifier
bn has therefore not demonstrated that the compuserve_trend_reference anticipates the asserted claims of the ¡¬411_patent requiring transmission of such an identifier with the degree of precision necessary to obtain summary_judgment on this point
however as noted above validity_challenges during preliminary_injunction_proceedings can be successful on evidence that would not suffice to support a judgment of invalidity at trial
see helifix 208 f.3d at 1352 54 uspq2d at 1308
the record in this case is simply not yet developed to the point where a determination can be made whether the compuserve_trend_system transmits the claimed identifier along with a request to order an item or whether this limitation is obvious in view of the prior_art
for example united_states_patent_no._5708,780` the ¡¬780_patent` a reference cited by bn which is discussed more fully below describes` forwarding a service_request from the client to the server and appending a session_identification sid to the request and to subsequent_service_requests from the client to the server within a session of requests'
see ¡¬780_patent col._3,_ll._12-16

moreover the ¡¬411_patent_specification itself dismisses the distinction between ordering systems in which an identifier is transmitted along with each request to order an item and systems in which a user logs in once at the beginning of each session
see ¡¬411_patent at col._10,_ll._6-10` [ t ] he purchaser can be alternatively identified by a unique customer identifier that is provided by the customer when the customer initiates access to the server_system and sent to the server_system with each message
``

the final distinction drawn by amazons counsel between the claimed invention and the compuserve_trend_system was that-according to amazon-the only reason that a purchaser would` call up' the screen would be to actually order an electronic_stock_chart and that therefore an earlier action taken by a purchaser to invoke the screen should count as an extra purchaser action
according to this argument the compuserve_trend_system would not meet the` single_action' limitation because at least two actions would need to be taken to order an item one action to invoke the ordering screen and a second_action to click on the ordering button
however as the screen shot plainly indicates a purchaser could use the display screen for purposes other than to order an electronic_stock_chart e.g. to` l ookup' a stock_symbol
furthermore to the extent that amazon argues that the compuserve trend fails to meet the` single_action' limitation due to the` click' necessary to activate the stock_chart ordering screen in the first place amazon also admits that bns express_lane_feature fails to meet the same limitation because of the` click' required to proceed from a menu_page to a product_page when using the express_lane_feature

as the compuserve trend stock_chart ordering screen indicates we note that once a purchaser types in a valid_stock_symbol the screen displays both` information identifying the item' i.e. the stock_symbol identifying the desired electronic_stock_chart and an indication of the` single_action' to be performed to order the identified_item i.e. clicking on the button labeled` c_hart $50'
therefore the substantial_question of invalidity raised by the compuserve_trend_reference is the same regardless of whether one considers claims explicitly requiring that both of *1363 these pieces of information be displayed i.e. claims 2_and_11 or claims requiring that only the` information identifying the item' be displayed i.e. claims 1 6 and 9

in view of the above we conclude that the district_court erred in failing to recognize that the compuserve_trend_reference raises a substantial_question of invalidity
whether the compuserve_trend_reference either anticipates and/or renders obvious the claimed invention in view of the knowledge of one of ordinary_skill in the relevant art is a matter for decision at trial

b
in addition to the compuserve_trend_system other_prior_art_references were cited by bn but ultimately rejected by the district_court
for example bns expert dr._lockwood testified that he developed an on-line ordering system called` web_basket' in or around august 1996
the web_basket_system appears to be an embodiment of a` shopping_cart ordering component' it requires users to accumulate items into a virtual shopping basket and to check these items out when they are finished shopping
because it is an implementation of a shopping_cart_model web_basket requires several confirmation_steps for even pre-registered users to complete their purchases

however despite the fact that web-basket is an embodiment of a shopping_cart_model it is undisputed that web-basket implemented the internet engineering task force` ietf' draft` cookie' specification and stored a customer identifier in a cookie for use by a web server to retrieve information from a database
in other words when a user first visited the web-basket site a cookie i.e. a file stored by the server_system on the client_system for subsequent use was used to store an identifier on the users computer
the first_time that a user purchased an item on the web_basket site the information entered by the user necessary to complete the purchase e.g. name address would be stored in a database on the server_system indexed by an identifier stored in the cookie on the client_system
on subsequent_visits the cookie could be used to retrieve the user identifier which would serve as the key to retrieve the users information from the database on the server_system

at the preliminary_injunction_stage based on dr._lockwoods declaration and testimony during the hearing bn argued that the web_basket_reference-combined with the knowledge of one of ordinary_skill in the art at the relevant time-renders obvious the claimed invention.1

the district_court concluded that the web_basket_system was` inconsistent with the single-action requirements of the ¡¬411_patent` because` it requires a multiple-step_ordering_process from the time that an item to be purchased is displayed'
however as discussed earlier the undisputed_evidence demonstrates that the accused bn express_lane_feature also requires a multiple-step_ordering_process i.e. at least two` clicks' from the time that an item to be purchased is first_displayed on the menu_page yet the district_court concluded that bns express_lane_feature infringed all of the asserted claims of the ¡¬411_patent
the district_courts failure to recognize the inconsistency in these two conclusions was erroneous

moreover the district_court did not address the` cookie' aspects of the web_basket_reference and failed to recognize *1364 that a reasonable_jury could find that the step of storing purchaser data on the server_system for subsequent retrieval indexed by an identifier transmitted from the client_system was anticipated and/or rendered obvious by the web_basket_reference

the district_court dismissed bns obviousness defense apparently based on an alleged` admission' by bns expert
in a section of its opinion entitled` summary of prior art' the district_court stated on the question of obviousness the court finds that the differences between the prior_art_references submitted by defendants and the ¡¬411_patent claims are significant
moreover there is insufficient evidence in the record regarding a teaching suggestion or motivation in the prior_art that would lead one of ordinary_skill in the art of e-commerce to combine the references
the court finds particularly telling dr._lockwoods admission that it never occurred to him to modify his web_basket program to enable single-action_ordering despite his testimony that such a modification would be easy to implement
this admission serves to negate dr._lockwoods conclusory statements that prior_art_references teach to one of ordinary_skill in the art the invention of the ¡¬411_patent
thus the district_court apparently based its conclusion of nonobviousness on dr._lockwoods` admission' that he personally never thought of combining or modifying the prior_art to come up with the claimed` single_action' invention
this approach was erroneous as a matter of law
whatever dr._lockwood did or did not personally realize at the time based on his actual knowledge is irrelevant
the relevant inquiry is what a hypothetical ordinarily skilled_artisan would have gleaned from the cited references at the time that the patent_application leading to the ¡¬411_patent was filed
see kimberly-clark corp. v. johnson & johnson 745_f.2d_1437 1453 223_uspq_603 612-14 fed.cir.1984 discussing the origin and significance of the hypothetical ordinarily skilled_artisan in detail

c. bn also presented as a prior_art_reference an excerpt from a book written by magdalena yesil entitled creating the virtual store that was copyrighted in 1996
before the district_court bn argued that this reference anticipated every limitation of claim 11
before this court bn also alleges that many other claim_limitations are disclosed in the reference but that there was insufficient time to prepare testimony concerning these limitations given the district_courts accelerated briefing and hearing schedule at the preliminary_injunction_stage

in general terms the reference apparently discusses software to implement a shopping_cart_ordering_model
however bn focuses on the following passage from appendix f of the book instant buy option
merchants also can provide shoppers with an instant buy button for some or all items enabling them to skip check out review
this provides added appeal for customers who already know the single item they want to purchase during their shopping excursion
the district_court dismissed the significance of this passage stating that` [ r ] ead in context the few lines relied on by defendants appear to describe only the elimination of the checkout review step leaving at least two other required steps to complete a purchase'
however the district_court failed to recognize that a reasonable_jury could find that this passage provides a motivation to modify shopping_cart ordering software to skip unnecessary steps
*1365 thus we find that this passage viewed in light of the rest of the reference and the other_prior_art_references cited by bn raises a substantial_question of validity with respect to the asserted claims of the ¡¬ 411 patent

d. another reference cited by bn a print-out from a web_page describing the` olivers market' ordering system generally describes a prior_art multi-step shopping_cart_model
bn argued that this reference anticipates at least_claim 9
the reference begins with an intriguing sentence a single click on its picture is all it takes to order an item
read in context the quote emphasizes how easy it is to order things on-line
the district_court failed to recognize that a reasonable_jury could find that this sentence provides a motivation to modify a shopping_cart_model to implement` single-click' ordering as claimed in the ¡¬411_patent
in addition the district_court failed to recognize that other passages from this reference could be construed by a reasonable_jury as anticipating and/or rendering obvious the allegedly novel` single_action_ordering_technology' of the ¡¬411_patent
for example the reference states that` [ o ] ur solution allows one-click ordering anywhere you see a product picture or a price'
the reference also describes a system in which a users identifying information e.g. username and password and purchasing information e.g. name phone number payment method delivery address is captured and stored in a database` the very first_time a user clicks on an item to order' and in which a corresponding cookie is stored on the client_system
in this system the stored information may be retrieved automatically during subsequent_visits by reading the cookie
all of these passages further support bns argument that a substantial_question of validity is raised by this prior_art_reference either alone or in combination with the other cited references

e. the final reference considered by the district_court is the ¡¬ 780 patent entitled` internet server access control and monitoring systems'
based on a patent_application filed in the united_states before the application that matured into amazons ¡¬411_patent the ¡¬780_patent qualifies as prior_art pursuant to 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 e 1994
before the district_court bn argued that this reference anticipated at least_claim 1 of the ¡¬411_patent

in the preferred embodiment described in the ¡¬780_patent a user browses the web conventionally and a content_server provides web documents to the user and determines when the user seeks access to` controlled' content i.e. web_pages for which the user needs authorization to browse
¡¬780_patent col._7,_ll._35-38
the ¡¬780_patent describes a system in which controlled pages are returned to the users browser when an authorized request is received by the content_server
we note that the ¡¬780_patent describes` forwarding a service_request from the client to the server and appending a session_identification sid to the request and to subsequent_service_requests from the client to the server within a session of requests'
id.at col._3,_ll._12-16

we conclude that the district_court failed to recognize that a reasonable_jury could find that such` items' i.e. controlled pages fall within the scope of the claimed invention and that delivery of these controlled pages based on receiving an authorized request from a users browser may constitute a` single_action_ordering component' within the meaning of the claims in the ¡¬411_patent
therefore the ¡¬780_patent is yet another prior_art_reference cited by bn which tends to raise a substantial *1366 question of validity either alone or in combination with the other cited references

the district_court also cited certain` secondary considerations' to support its conclusion of nonobviousness
specifically the district_court cited 1` copying of the invention' by bn and other e-commerce retailers following amazons introduction of its` 1-clickthe_r' feature and 2` the need to solve the problem of abandoned shopping_carts'
first we note that evidence of copying amazons` 1-clickthe_r' feature is legally irrelevant unless the` 1-clickthe_r' feature is shown to be an embodiment of the claims
to the extent amazon can demonstrate that its` 1-clickthe_r' feature embodies any asserted claims of the ¡¬411_patent under the correct claim_interpretation evidence of copying by bn and others is not sufficient to demonstrate nonobviousness of the claimed invention in view of the substantial_question of validity raised by the prior_art_references cited by bn and discussed herein

with respect to the abandoned shopping_carts this problem is not even mentioned in the ¡¬411_patent
moreover amazon did not submit any evidence to show either that its commercial success was related to the` 1-clickthe_r' ordering feature or that single-action_ordering caused a reduction in the number of abandoned shopping_carts
therefore we fail to see how this` consideration' supports amazons nonobviousness argument

conclusion
while it appears on the record before us that amazon has carried its burden with respect to demonstrating the likelihood of success on infringement it is also true that bn has raised substantial_questions as to the validity of the ¡¬411_patent
for that reason we must conclude that the necessary prerequisites for entry of a preliminary_injunction are presently lacking
we therefore vacate the preliminary_injunction and remand the case for further_proceedings

costs
vacated and remanded

on appeal bn asserts that a defense of anticipation had been raised based on the web_basket_system by dr._lockwoods claim charts
however our review of the record indicates that dr._lockwood admitted that at least one claim_limitation in each of the independent_claims may not have been anticipated by the web_basket_system
therefore at this stage we address only the obviousness issues related to the web_basket_system
