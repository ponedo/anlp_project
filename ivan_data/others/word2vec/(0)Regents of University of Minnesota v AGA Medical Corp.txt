background patentee filed action against competitor alleging infringement of patents directed to medical_devices for repairing heart_defects
the united states district court for the district of minnesota patrick j. schiltz j. 660_f.supp.2d_1037 construed disputed terms partially granted competitors motion for summary_judgment of noninfringement 2011_wl_13943 and then granted competitors motion for summary_judgment of invalidity
patentee appealed

holdings the court of appeals dyk circuit_judge held that

phrase` first and second_occluding_disks' meant physically distinct and separate first and second_occluding_disks ;

patent had not been infringed by accused product ;

prior_art that contained two umbrella-shaped parts oriented like umbrellas joined at their tips anticipated claims of patent ;

patentees disclaimer during prosecution of prior patent applications regarding use of radial_frame as equivalent of peripheral_frame for medical device for repairing heart_defects did not carry forward to means-plus-function_language used in subsequent_application that contained different_claim_limitation than its predecessors and captured different_subject_matter ;

phrase` at least a substantial_portion of the central_portion of the first_member' be` in communication with at least a substantial_portion of the second_member' required that substantial_portions of central_portions of members communicated` movement' ;

patentee waived any objection to aspect of district_courts construction on claim of anticipation that allegedly wrongly allowed translational_movement communicated between prior_arts members to satisfy` in communication with' claim_limitation ; and

patentee was barred from making argument on appeal that` central_portion' of each member in patent directed to medical_devices for repairing heart_defects had to fill septal_defect and that prior_arts hub did not satisfy that requirement

opinion
dyk circuit_judge
appellant regents of the university of minnesota` the university' owns u.s._patent_no._6077,281` the ¡¬281_patent` and u.s._patent_no._6077,291` the ¡¬291_patent` which are directed to medical_devices for repairing heart_defects
the university accused aga_medical corporation` aga' of infringing both patents
after claim_construction the district_court granted summary_judgment that the ¡¬291_patent was not infringed and that the asserted_claims of the ¡¬281_patent were invalid as anticipated
the university appeals arguing that the district_court erred in its construction of the claims of the ¡¬291_patent and in finding the ¡¬281_patent anticipated by a prior_art_device
we affirm

background
the ¡¬291 and ¡¬281_patent s are directed toward` septal_occluders' which are medical_devices used to block holes in a thin wall of muscle and tissue a` septum' dividing two chambers of the heart
`` transcatheter' septal_occluders can be delivered to the heart and positioned in a septal_defect using a catheter threaded through a vein
in 1975 king and mills received a patent on the first transcatheter septal occluder` the king_device'
u.s._pat
no._3874,388 filed feb._12,_1973

in 1992 the university filed patent application no._07 /822,951` the ¡¬951_application' claiming a transcatheter septal occluder invented by dr. gladwin das
four patents eventually issued from successive *933 divisions of the ¡¬951_application including u.s._patent no._5334,217` the ¡¬217_patent` issued in april 1994 another patent not at issue here and the ¡¬291 and ¡¬281_patent s which were both issued in june 2000
the patents have different_claims but generally share the same specification
the` summary of the invention' explains that the claimed device has` first and second_occluding_disks which are attached to one another' centrally
¡¬291_patent_col. 3_ll._7 -8 ; ¡¬281_patent_col. 3_ll._11 -12
each disk comprises a membrane and a frame and can be` collapsed' to fit in a catheter
¡¬291_patent_col. 3_ll._8 -12
the device is delivered through the catheter to the heart where it is positioned with one disk on each side of the defective_septum
as the catheter is withdrawn the disks expand covering both sides of the defective_septum and blocking the hole
see id.at col. 3_ll._10 -14
the patents shared specification acknowledges prior_art septal_occluders with expandable membranes including the patented king_device and a device described in an article by dr. james lock` the lock_device'
the lock and king_devices both have` umbrella-like' structures mounted on radial_frames
the specification of the patents-in-suit disparages prior_art radial_frame devices as` mechanically complex and requir [ ing ] a great deal of remote manipulation for deployment' ¡¬ 291 patent_col. 2_ll._44 -45 ; ¡¬281_patent_col. 2_ll._48 -49 and because the` single point or pivot' connecting the two umbrella structures can drift within the septal_defect allowing the device to become decentered
¡¬291_patent_col. 2_ll._52 -56 ; ¡¬281_patent_col. 2_ll._56 -60

in 2007 the university filed suit against aga alleging infringement of the ¡¬291 and ¡¬281_patent s. agas accused septal_occluders are one-piece devices made from tubes of wire mesh
the mesh is molded into a preset_shape with two large flat regions separated by a narrow_waist
the device can be compressed into an elongated shape to fit in a catheter
upon deployment from the catheter inside the heart the device spontaneously springs back to the preset_shape and blocks the septal_defect

at the parties request the district_court held a markman hearing and construed various disputed terms in the ¡¬291 and ¡¬281_patent s. see regents of the univ
of minn. v. aga_med corp. 660_f.supp.2d_1037 d.minn.2009
in january 2011 the court partially granted agas motion for summary_judgment of noninfringement ruling that no reasonable_jury could find that agas one-piece mesh device infringed the ¡¬291_patent

in december 2011 the court granted agas motion for summary_judgment of invalidity with respect to asserted_claims 1 4 and 5 of the ¡¬281_patent regents of the univ
of minn. v. aga_med corp. 835_f.supp.2d_711_(d.minn.2011) finding that all three claims were anticipated by the prior_art lock_device id.at 723-26.1 the district_court dismissed agas remaining counterclaims as moot
id.at 713-14.2 the university *934 timely appealed and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1
although the patents in this case are related they present distinct legal issues on appeal so we discuss them separately

discussion
i
the ¡¬291_patent
a
claim_construction
the dispute as to the ¡¬291_patent turns almost entirely on claim_construction
claim_construction is a question of law markman v. westview instruments inc. 52_f.3d_967 976-80 fed.cir.1995 en banc affd 517_u.s._370 116_s.ct._1384 134_l.ed.2d_577_(1996) which we review without deference cybor corp. v. fas techs. inc. 138_f.3d_1448 1454-55 fed.cir.1998 en banc

representative claim 1 of the ¡¬291_patent describes a septal occluder with two occluding disks` affixed' to one another at their centers to` define a conjoint_disk' 1
a septal_defect_closure_device comprising first and second_occluding_disks each disk comprising a flexible biologically compatible_membrane capable of being collapsed for passage through a catheter and elastically returning to a predetermined shape for tautly holding a portion of the membrane against a septum ; a central_portion of the membrane of the first_disk being affixed to a central_portion of the membrane of the second_disk to define a conjoint_disk.. ¡¬291_patent_col. 17_ll._54 -61 emphases added

as shown in figures 3_and_4 a preferred_embodiment of the claimed invention comprises two membrane_disks 20 30 each having a jointed pentagonal frame 24` attached to and desirably extend [ ing ] substantially around the periphery of the membrane'
¡¬291_patent_col. 5_ll._5 -6
the flexible frames can be compressed to allow the device to pass through a catheter for delivery to the heart
as the catheter is withdrawn and the device is released the frames expand to pull the membrane_disks taut
figure 3 depicts a side view of the device with the two membrane_disks fully expanded 22 32 and the smaller` conjoint_disk' 40 between them

?
*935 ¡¬291_patent figs

figure 4 illustrates how in this preferred_embodiment the two membrane_disks are` sewn to one another.. with the stitching defining the shape and size of the conjoint_disk' 40
¡¬291_patent_col. 7_ll._55 -57
an appropriately sized conjoint_disk is positioned inside the septal_defect while the expanded frames which are larger than the defect rest against either side of the septum to hold the device in place
with respect to the ¡¬291_patent one issue of claim_construction is disputed on appeal whether the district_court correctly construed the patent to require two discrete disks
all independent claims of the ¡¬291_patent relate to a device with` first and second_disks' or` first and second_occluding_disks'
regents 660 f.supp.2d at 1042
the two disks are described as` affixed' claims 1 4 23 24 30` joined' claims 17 24 25 or` connected' claim 28 to one another forming a` conjoint' structure claims 1-5 9 11 12 14 15 23 25-27
as the district_court noted` [ t ] he parties.. agreed to treat the termsaffixedjoined andconnected as essentially synonymous'
id.at 1041
nor does either party dispute that throughout the ¡¬291_patent the term` conjoint' is used to denote the affixed joined or connected portions of the disks
the district_court concluded that` a person of ordinary skill in the art.. would read the ¡¬ 291 patent as covering only a device made up of two physically separate_disks that are attached to one another' and therefore construed the phrase` first and second [ occluding ] disks' to mean` physically distinct and separate_disks'
id.at 1045
the court reasoned that` one does not ordinarily speak of the parts of a unitary structure as beingaffixed orjoined orconnected to each other' id.at 1044 and concluded that this` clear implication.. should be made explicit' in its claim_construction by requiring that the disks had been originally separate id.at 1043
the court` reached this decision in part based on how the phraseconjoint_disk is used throughout the patent' that is to describe a structure formed by affixing joining or connecting the two disks
id.at 1044 ; see also id.at 1056
a subsequent order elaborated that` [ t ] he worddisks in the phrasesfirst and second_occluding_disks andfirst and second_disks meansdisks that before being affixed joined or connected exist separately as individual physically distinct disks
`` regents 2011_wl_13943 at *2
it is undisputed that this construction excludes agas device which is molded from a single tubular piece of mesh

on appeal the university argues that the district_courts construction improperly imported limitations from outside the claims and is unsupported by the specification or prosecution_history
we disagree

the claim_language fully supports a requirement of separateness
independent_claim 1 explains that the` conjoint_disk' is formed by` affix [ ing ]' the membranes of the` first and second_occluding_disks' to one another
¡¬291_patent_col. 17_ll._54 -64
dependent method claim 23 describes the occluder as having` a central_portion of the flexible_structure of the first_disk being affixed directly to a central_portion of the flexible_structure of the second_disk to define [ a ] conjoint_disk'
id.at_col. 19_ll._16 -19
both dependent claims 11_and_12 describe a` conjoint_disk'` compris [ ing ] a piece of another material disposed between the first and second_disks' further supporting the conclusion that the two disks must be discrete structures.3 id.at_col. 18_ll._23 -29

*936 the separateness requirement is also fully supported by the specification which is` the single_best_guide to the meaning of a disputed term'
phillips v. awh_corp. 415_f.3d_1303 1315 fed.cir.2005 en banc quoting vitronics corp. v. conceptronic inc. 90_f.3d_1576 1582 fed.cir.1996
the ¡¬291 specification never teaches an embodiment constructed as a single piece
quite the opposite` every single embodiment disclosed in the ¡¬291_patents drawings and its written description is made up of two separate_disks'
regents 660 f.supp.2d at 1044
the ¡¬291_patent explains that
[ t ] he present_invention provides a simple reliable device for effectively occluding a septal_defect
the instant closure device includes first and second_occluding_disks which are attached to one another.. a central_portion of the membrane of each disk is affixed to a corresponding portion of the membrane of the other disk thereby attaching the two disks directly to one another at their centers
the affixed central_portion of the two membranes define [ ] a central` conjoint_disk' of the device.. ¡¬291_patent_col. 3_ll._5 -20
`` when a patent thus describes the features of thepresent_invention as a whole this description limits the scope of the invention'
verizon servs corp. v. vonage holdings corp. 503_f.3d_1295 1308 fed.cir.2007 ; see also tivo inc. v. echostar commc'ns corp. 516_f.3d_1290 1300 fed.cir.2008

the specification discloses various methods of affixing the two disks to one another including gluing bonding fusing and sewing
it warns that` [ t ] he adhesion between the two central membrane portions should be strong enough to ensure that the two disks will not become separated from one another' ¡¬291_patent_col. 7_ll._50 -53 indicating that the membrane_disks forming the conjoint_disk are structurally distinct and thus prone to` separate' rather than` tear'
all conjoint_disks described or pictured in the specification are structurally consistent with two discrete surfaces adhered together in various ways
see e.g. ¡¬291_patent fig.12 ; col. 9_ll._15 -20 ; col. 7_ll._62 -66 ; col. 8_ll._60 -63
moreover the specification discloses that` the conjoint_disk may include another piece of material' that is` desirably disposed between the two membranes and sewn or otherwise bonded to the two membranes in defining the conjoint_disk' -a configuration that can only make sense if the disk membranes are separate physically distinct structures

the district_courts construction is further buttressed by the prosecution_history
during the prosecution of the ¡¬951_application the predecessor to the ¡¬291_patent4 the pto_examiner rejected the relevant claims as anticipated by kings prior_art septal occluder which also possessed two flexible occluding disks
the king_device comprised two membranes supported by *937 umbrella-like_radial_frames which were individually delivered through a catheter
once inside the heart they were connected at a central` hub' and the umbrellas were opened to block the septal_defect
j.a
1671
the university in its response to the ptos office action argued that kings umbrella-like structures had to be` attached to one another after they are deployed in a patients beating heart' using a` complex multi-component hub' while the` two disks' of the universitys device` each formed of a membrane and a frame' were advantageously assembled prior to insertion in the catheter and the assembly was simplified by` attach [ ing ] the membranes of the two disks essentially directly to one another' to form a` conjoint_disk'
j.a
1706-08

although the ¡¬951_application was abandoned a division of that application produced the predecessor ¡¬217_patent
like the ¡¬951_application the ¡¬217_patent requires` a central_portion of the membrane of the first_disk being affixed to a central_portion of the membrane of the second_disk to define a central conjoint_disk' ¡¬217_patent_col. 18_ll._37 -39 ; j.a
5227 which is claim_language substantially identical to that of the ¡¬ 291 patent
the examiners supplemental notice of allowability indicated that` [ t ] he primary reason for the allowance of the [ ¡¬217_patents ] claims [ wa ] s the inclusion in all the claims of the limitation that.. a first membrane is connected to a central_portion of a second membrane to form a conjoint_disk'
j.a
5274 emphasis added5 thus the prosecution_history supports the district_courts construction of the claims

finally the district_courts construction is faithful to the ordinary_meaning of the language of claim 1
according to dictionaries predating the 1996 filing of the ¡¬291_patent the word` affix' means 1. to fasten join or attach usually fol
by to to affix stamps to a letter
2 to put or add on ; append to affix a signature to a contract
3 to impress a seal or stamp
4. to attach blame reproach ridicule etc
random_house unabridged dictionary 34 2d ed.1993 or 1 to attach physically as by nails or glue fasten.. 2 to attach in any way connect with add subjoin.. 3 impress.. websters third_new_international_dictionary 36 1993
the ordinary_meaning of` conjoint' is` joined together ; united ; combined ; associated' or` pertaining to or formed by two or more in combination ; joint' random_house unabridged dictionary 430 emphasis added and according to the note on synonyms of` join' in websters third` conjoin usu [ ally ] emphasizes both the togetherness of a joining and the separateness of the things joined'
websters third_new_international_dictionary 1219 emphasis added
as further explained by websters third *938 [ a ] lthough they are used to signify a more specific union link connect join and conjoin in their nonphysical_application may suggest a bringing or coming together as general and unspecified as that implied by relate or associate but tend more esp [ ecially ] in physical_application to signify a junction of some kind often an inseparable junction as by a chain or by bonding
connect is the most general of these four and suggests a loose attachment esp [ ecially ] one that preserves the identity of the elements and the evidence of the connection.. link suggests a slightly closer coupling [ ] esp [ ecially ] in the physical_application of the word in which is implied inseparability but of still clearly identifiably separate elements.. join usu [ ally ] suggests strongly the idea of physical or moral contact or junction or the making of a continuity of two or more things.. id
( emphases added
the dictionary definitions support the conclusion that when a physical object is described as having been` affixed'` joined'` connected' or` conjoin [ ed ]' to another object it means that those objects were previously separate

the university argues that the district_court improperly imported process_limitations into the construed claims
we disagree
words like` affixed' or` conjoint' which when` read in context describe [ ] the product more by its structure than by the process used to obtain it' are product limitations not process_limitations see e.g. hazani v. u.s. int l trade comm n 126_f.3d_1473 1479 fed.cir.1997 citing in re moore 58_ccpa_1042 439_f.2d_1232 1236 1971 and are` commonly and by default interpreted in their structural sense' 3m innovative props co. v. avery dennison corp. 350_f.3d_1365 1371 fed.cir.2003 ; see also in re garnero 56_ccpa_1289 412_f.2d_276 278-79 1969` [ i ] ntermixedground in placepress fittedetched andwelded all.. at one time or another have been separately held capable of construction as structural rather than process limitations`
when a patentee chooses to use these words they should be given their ordinary_meanings with respect to the claimed products structure
see e.g. vanguard prods corp. v. parker hannifin corp. 234_f.3d_1370 1372-73 fed.cir.2000 ; hazani 126 f.3d at 1479
in miken composites l.l.c
v. wilson sporting goods co. 515_f.3d_1331 1337 fed.cir.2008 we rejected the patentees contention that the district_court impermissibly imported a process_limitation into a product_claim concluding that the ordinary_meaning of the word` insert' required a particular relationship between the` insert' and a surrounding frame to contend.. that it does not matter whether an insert is placed into a pre-existing frame or whether a frame is built around it ignores that ordinary and customary meaning.. as for [ the patentees ] contention that the district_court impermissibly imported a process_limitation into a product_claim we disagree
as we have discussed the district_court merely adopted an ordinary_meaning of the terminsert
id
similarly in vanguard we` agree [ d ] with the district_court that the wordintegral describes the relationship between the elastomeric layers not the means of joining them' and held that`integral is used here in its ordinary sense to mean formed as a unit with another part' because` the term was used to describe the product and not as a designation of a specific manufacturing process'
234 f.3d at 1371-72
our reading of the ¡¬291_patent is fully consistent with the approach used in our previous cases

*939 in sum the ¡¬291_patents claims` consistently use the term [ s ]' affixed and conjoint` in the sense of [ their ] ordinary_meaning [ s ]' miken 515 f.3d at 1337 indicating that the disks are discrete structures
the specification` the single_best_guide to the meaning of a disputed term' vitronics 90 f.3d at 1582` comports with the plain_language of the claims fully supporting the conclusion' that the disks are separate see becton dickinson & co. v. tyco healthcare grp. 616_f.3d_1249 1255 fed.cir.2010
finally the prosecution_history shows that the university described the innovative aspect of the claimed device as an improved way of connecting the two disks
we conclude that the district_court properly construed the ¡¬291_patent as requiring two physically separate_disks

b
infringement
on appeal the university argues that agas mesh tube devices infringe even under the district_courts claim_construction because agas sales literature describes them as having two` disks'
however agas sales descriptions neither expand the ¡¬291_patent nor bring agas device within its scope
it is undisputed that agas accused occluders are not constructed from two physically separate_disks
regents 2011_wl_13943 at *9
agas devices are made from lengths of mesh tubing ; the tubing is molded into two flattened end portions separated by a narrow_waist
the wires of the mesh run continuously from one end of the device to the other
at no point are two halves of the tube` affixed' to one another and no structure resembling a` conjoint_disk' is present between them
the district_court thus correctly determined that no reasonable_jury could find that agas devices infringe the ¡¬291_patent
id
we therefore affirm the district_courts grant of summary_judgment of non-infringement to aga with respect to the ¡¬ 291 patent

ii
the ¡¬281_patent
like the ¡¬291_patent the ¡¬281_patent is directed to a transcatheter septal occluder device
claim 1 of the ¡¬281_patent describes the device as comprising two` members' each having a` self-expanding structure' 1
a septal_defect_closure_device comprising a first_member and a second_member each comprising a self-expanding structure exhibiting a spring-like_behavioural_component for moving the member between a compressed_orientation for passage through a medical_instrument having an inner_diameter and an expanded orientation having an enlarged_diameter for tautly holding at least a portion of the closure device against a septum the enlarged_diameter of the member being greater than the inner_diameter of the medical_instrument ; each of the first and second_members also including a central_portion at least a substantial_portion of the central_portion of the second_member being in communication with at least a substantial_portion of the central_portion of the first_member
¡¬281_patent_col. 18_ll._11 -24 emphases added
the specifications of the two patents are generally the same including the description of the preferred_embodiment with a jointed wire frame which was discussed above
see ¡¬281_patent figs
3 4

the district_court held that the ¡¬281 claims reference to` members' did not require separateness and thus a reasonable_jury could conclude the claims were infringed by agas devices
regents 2011_wl_13943 at *9
however the court held that the asserted_claims of the ¡¬281_patent were anticipated
regents 835 f.supp.2d at 723-26
like an infringement analysis an anticipation analysis *940 has two parts first the disputed claim_terms are construed then the construed claims are compared to the prior_art
in re aoyama 656_f.3d_1293 1296 fed.cir.2011
a patented invention is anticipated by a prior_art_reference if that reference discloses all elements of the claimed invention including means-plus-function structures or their equivalents
see e.g. kegel co. v. amf bowling 127_f.3d_1420 1430 fed.cir.1997
`` while anticipation is a question of factit may be decided on summary_judgment if the record reveals no genuine dispute of material_fact` a decision that we review de novo

whether the prosecution_history imposes a limitation on the range of equivalents is a legal determination reviewed de novo
j & m corp. v. harley-davidson inc. 269_f.3d_1360 1366 fed.cir.2001

in this case the question is whether the prior_art_device described in the lock article anticipated claims 1 4 and 5 of the ¡¬281_patent
independent_claim 1 set forth in full above states in relevant part 1
a septal_defect_closure_device comprising a first_member and a second_member each comprising a self-expanding structure exhibiting a spring-like_behavioural_component for moving the member between a compressed_orientation.. and an expanded orientation.. at least a substantial_portion of the central_portion of the second_member being in communication with at least a substantial_portion of the central_portion of the first_member
¡¬281_patent_col. 18_ll._11 -24 emphasis added
dependent_claim 4 states 4
the device of claim 1 wherein the first_member in its compressed_orientation extends primarily distally from the second_member and the second_member in its compressed_orientation extends primarily proximally from the first_member each member in its expanded orientation extending primarily radially outward from its central_portion
id.at_col. 18_ll._31 -36
dependent_claim 5 states 5
the device of claim 1 wherein each of the first and second_members comprises a flexible fabric disk
id.at_col. 18_ll._37 -38
the district_court determined that although the prior_art king_device anticipated claims 1_and_5 king did not satisfy claim 4 because of the orientation of its umbrella-like_radial_frames
regents 835 f.supp.2d at 717-22
however the district_court determined that all three claims were anticipated by the lock_device which like king used umbrella-like_radial_frames
id.at 723-26
the university agrees that the lock_device has all the limitations of the three asserted_claims with the exception of the following two elements 1 a structure satisfying the means-plus-function_limitation and 2 structures` in communication with' each other and having` at least substantial_portions of the [ ir ] central_portion [ s ]' in communication with one another

a
the means-plus-function_limitation
although claim 1 of the ¡¬281_patent was not drafted in standard means-plus-function_language the court determined and the parties now agree that the portion reading a self-expanding structure exhibiting a spring-like_behavioural_component for moving the member between a compressed_orientation.. and an expanded orientation
is a means-plus-function_element ¡¬281_patent_col. 18_ll._11 -16 with the function of` moving the member from a compressed *941 orientation to an expanded orientation' regents 660 f.supp.2d at 1051
under section 112 ?

section 112 f a means-plus-function claim_limitation includes both the corresponding_structures disclosed by the specification as means of performing the function and the equivalents of those structures
see mettler-toledo inc. v. b-tek scales llc 671_f.3d_1291 1296 fed.cir.2012
here the district_court concluded that the specification disclosed two corresponding_structures` a frameless membrane made of a thin piece of a superelastic material' and` a flexible elastically deformable_frame carried around the periphery of the member' the` peripheral_frame_structure'
regents 660 f.supp.2d at 1050-52
the parties do not dispute the identification of these structures

neither party argues that the lock_device has a frameless superelastic membrane or a peripheral_frame
however the district_court concluded that locks radial umbrella-like frame was an equivalent of the peripheral_frame_structure in the claimed device
for purposes of section 112 f an equivalent of the disclosed structure performs the same_function as the disclosed structure in substantially the same_way with substantially the same_result
see e.g. jvw enters
v. interact accessories inc. 424_f.3d_1324 1333 fed.cir.2005
aga presented expert evidence accepted by the district_court that locks` springy' radial_frame performed the same_function as the peripheral_frame_structure-' mov [ ing ] [ the device ] from a compressed to an expanded orientation' -in substantially the same_way with substantially the same_result
regents 835 f.supp.2d at 720

the university argues that the district_court was wrong to treat this issue as undisputed because there was conflicting expert testimony as to equivalence
the district_court disagreed determining that there was no conflicting expert testimony because` on the question of equivalence [ the universitys expert ] o'laughlin.. fail [ ed ] to offer any evidence or analysis'
id.at 725
the district_court correctly found o'laughlins testimony on equivalence to be` a conclusion supported by no explanation or reasoning' and therefore inadequate
id.at 720
`` conclusory expert assertions can not raise triable issues of material_fact on summary_judgment'
sitrick v. dreamworks llc 516_f.3d_993 1001 fed.cir.2008 citing dynacore holdings corp. v. u.s. philips corp. 363_f.3d_1263 1278 fed.cir.2004

this leads us to the universitys primary argument that during prosecution it disclaimed the use of a radial_frame as an equivalent of the peripheral_frame
the university argues that this disclaimer took place during prosecution of the ¡¬951_application which was the predecessor to the patents-in-suit
independent_claim 1 of the ¡¬951_application stated 1
a septal_defect_closure_device comprising first and second_occluding_disks each disk comprising a flexible biologically compatible_membrane having a periphery and an elastically deformable_frame carried about the periphery of the membrane.. j.a
1625 emphasis added
the claim did not include a means-plus-function_element
the pto_examiner rejected the claim as anticipated by king explaining that king disclosed features including` occluding disks' and` frames carried about the periphery of the disks by sutures'
j.a
1671

the university criticized and distinguished king arguing inter alia that unlike king the claimed device did not have an umbrella-like radial_frame but rather a frame` extend [ ing ] along the periphery of the membrane' of each disk
j.a
1706- *942 08
the university also submitted an amendment which it described as expressly limiting the claim_language to` a frame which extends along the periphery of the disk something which kings radial_arms simply do not do'
j.a
1707
the amendment replaced` carried about' with` extending along and attached adjacent to'
j.a
1698 1707
after the amendment the ¡¬ 951 claim_language read 1
a septal_defect_closure_device comprising first and second_occluding_disks each disk comprising a flexible biologically compatible_membrane having a periphery and an elastically deformable_frame extending along and attached adjacent to the periphery of the membrane.. see j.a
1625 original language ; j.a
1698 1707 explaining the relevant substitution in language emphasis added
( the university and examiner apparently never discussed the lock_device in connection with any of the patents in the family although lock was mentioned in the specification and at least one article describing the lock_device was before the examiner
claim 1 was subsequently allowed.6

when an applicant tells the pto that a prior_art_reference lies outside the scope of his claim he is bound by that argument
southwall techs. inc. v. cardinal ig co. 54_f.3d_1570 1579-80 fed.cir.1995
in this case no one disputes that the university effected a clear and unambiguous disclaimer of kings radial_frame with respect to the language describing the` elastically deformable_frame' in amended claim 1 of the ¡¬951_application
nor is there any apparent dispute that the universitys disclaimer of kings radial_frame is also applicable to the similar radial_frame disclosed by lock
the question is whether the universitys disclaimer carries forward to the means-plus-function_language used in claim 1 of the ¡¬281_patent

our law makes clear that` [ j ] ust as prosecution_history estoppel may act to estop an equivalence argument under the doctrine of equivalents positions taken before the pto may bar an inconsistent position on claim_construction under ¡± 112 ?
6'
alpex computer corp. v. nintendo co. 102_f.3d_1214 1221 fed.cir.1996
thus prosecution_history disclaimer may limit the range of equivalent structures that fall within the scope of a means-plus-function_limitation
see e.g. j & m 269 f.3d at 1367
we have also held that a disclaimer made during the prosecution of a patent application may operate as a disclaimer with respect to later patents of the same family
verizon 503 f.3d at 1306

*943 the problem for the university is that this limitation of the ¡¬951_application was not carried forward to the ¡¬281_patent
after the ¡¬951_application was abandoned in 1993 successive divisions produced the ¡¬281_patent which issued in 2000.7 over the course of four divisional_applications and seven years of prosecution the amended claim_limitations disappeared from the ¡¬281_patent to be replaced with the means-plus-function_limitation

1
a septal_defect_closure_device comprising a first_member and a second_member each comprising a self-expanding structure exhibiting a spring-like_behavioural_component for moving the member between a compressed_orientation.. and an expanded orientation.. ¡¬281_patent_col. 18_ll._11 -24 emphasis added
there is no mention of a frame peripheral or otherwise in any claim of the ¡¬281_patent
we have explained that` [ w ] hen the purported disclaimers [ made during prosecution ] are directed to specific claim_terms that have been omitted or materially altered in subsequent_applications rather than to the invention itself those disclaimers do not apply'
saunders_grp. inc. v. comfortrac inc. 492_f.3d_1326 1333 fed.cir.2007
in general a prosecution disclaimer will only apply to a subsequent patent if that patent contains the same claim_limitation as its predecessor
see e.g. ventana med
sys
v. biogenex labs. inc. 473_f.3d_1173 1182 fed.cir.2006` [ p ] rosecution disclaimer generally does not apply when the claim_term in the descendent patent uses different language
`` ; invitrogen corp. v. clontech labs. inc. 429_f.3d_1052 1078 fed.cir.2005` [ t ] he prosecution of one claim_term in a parent_application will generally not limit different_claim_language in a continuation application
`` ; resqnet.com inc. v. lansa inc. 346_f.3d_1374 1383 fed.cir.2003` prosecution history is irrelevant to the meaning of [ a ] limitation [ if ] the two patents do not share the same claim_language
`` ; biogen inc. v. berlex labs. inc. 318_f.3d_1132 1141 fed.cir.2003` when the applicant is seeking different_claims in a divisional_application estoppel generally does not arise from the prosecution of the parent
``8

thus our cases establish that the two patents must have the same or closely related claim_limitation language
if the language of the later limitation is significantly different the disclaimer will not apply
for example this court recently concluded in digital-vending that an inventors arguments with respect to certain *944 claim_limitations in a parent should not apply to significantly different_claim_limitations in a divisional_application
digital-vending servs
int l llc v. univ
of phoenix inc. 672_f.3d_1270 1277 fed.cir.2012
the court explained that` in light of the language of the later issued claims' and the fact that` the inventors never argued' that the disclaimer applied` when pursuing the divisional_application that gave rise to the [ patent-in-suit ]' application of the disclaimer to the divisionals claims would be improper
id

although the ¡¬281_patents claims do not include a peripheral_frame limitation the university argues that the peripheral_frame_structure described in the specification satisfies the same language requirement
as amended claim 1 of the ¡¬951_application required` an elastically deformable_frame extending along and attached adjacent to the periphery of the membrane'
see j.a
1698 emphasis added
the structure corresponding to the means-plus-function_limitation in claim 1 of the ¡¬281_patent has` [ a ] frame.. [ that ] is attached to and desirably extends substantially around the periphery of the membrane'
¡¬281_patent_col. 5_ll._7 -8 emphasis added

the university is mistaken
the proper inquiry is whether the scope of the claim_limitation is substantially the same in the subsequent_application as it was in the earlier application
see e.g. advanced cardiovascular sys. inc. v. medtronic inc. 265_f.3d_1294 1305 fed.cir.2001 prosecution_history may be relevant if` it addresses a limitation in common with the patent in suit' ; elkay mfg co. v. ebco mfg co. 192_f.3d_973 980 fed.cir.1999` [ t ] he prosecution_history regarding a claim_limitation.. applies with equal force to subsequently issued patents that contain the same_limitation`
in disclaiming claim coverage in light of certain prior_art the applicant does not thereby act as a lexicographer redefining individual words
the appropriate focus is on the scope of the claim element not the meaning of particular words in isolation
this is why our cases evaluate the similarity between the earlier and later claim_limitations carrying disclaimer forward if there are only immaterial differences see e.g. elkay 192 f.3d at 979-80 carrying disclaimer forward where` [ t ] he relevant portion of claim 1 of the [ later ] patent is identical to the above-quoted limitation in claim 1 of the [ first ] patent' except for a single word ; see also invitrogen 429 f.3d at 1078 amendment` to a related limitation in the parent_application' is relevant to` a later though differently worded limitation' and declining to extend disclaimer to a subsequent limitation that contained` materially' different_claim_language see saunders_grp. 492 f.3d at 1333 ; see also medtronic inc. v. advanced cardiovascular systems inc. 248_f.3d_1303 1315 fed.cir.2001` [ n ] one of the claims of the [ earlier ] patent contain the same_limitation that we are construing from the [ later ] patent' and` [ a ] ccordingly we decline.. to consider the [ earlier ] patents prosecution_history for the purpose of construing the limitation in question
``

our requirement that the patents share` limitations in common' is not a mere technicality it is necessary to support the inference that the patentees earlier arguments are also applicable to the claim_limitations of the patent-in-suit
see e.g. digital-vending 672 f.3d at 1277
without claim_language that makes that linkage clear neither the pto_examiner nor the patentees competitors would be on notice as to the true scope of the later patents claims
we have held that it is permissible for a patentee to take a different approach to claiming an invention in subsequent patents either by adding limitations *945 or by altering the claims format
when the patentee does so however we can not rely on the dubious argument that dissimilar claims present equivalent issues of validity or that the applicants disclaimer with respect to one claim would be equally applicable to another claim

here the basis for distinguishing prior_art in the second_application is not the same as in the first
the amended ¡¬951 claim_language` [ a ] septal_defect_closure_device comprising first and second_occluding_disks each disk comprising.. an elastically deformable_frame extending along and attached adjacent to the periphery of the membrane' see j.a
1625 1698 1707 was not carried over to the later_application which gave rise to the ¡¬281_patent
the later_application instead used the language` [ a ] septal_defect_closure_device comprising a first_member and a second_member each comprising a self-expanding structure' ¡¬281_patent_col. 18_ll._11 -24 and disclosed two corresponding_structures in the specification one of which contained a peripheral_frame_structure
the scope of claim 1 in the second_application is plainly not the same as it was in the first_application and it would be inappropriate to import the first_applications limitations into the different context of the second_application
`` although statements in a file history may of course be used to explain and potentially limit the meaning of claim_limitations' they` can not be used to add an entirely new limitation to the claim'
serrano v. telular corp. 111_f.3d_1578 1584 fed.cir.1997 ; see also markman 52 f.3d at 980` although the prosecution_history can and should be used to understand the language used in the claims it.. can notenlarge diminish or vary the limitations in the claims`
it is likewise inappropriate to apply a narrowing disclaimer to limitations that are materially different from the limitation to which it originally applied

in other words claim 1 of the ¡¬281_patent contains a different_claim_limitation than its predecessors and captures different_subject_matter
from the examiners perspective prior_art_devices like king and lock are relevant in different ways to the ¡¬951_applications literal` frame carried about the periphery' requirement and the ¡¬281 claims functional` self-expanding structure' requirement
during the prosecution of the first_application the university never told the pto_examiner that a radial_frame was ineffective at expanding a devices occluding disks ; instead the university criticized the king_device as being too difficult to assemble and keep in position
it does not follow that the university found the radial_frame unacceptable for use in performing the claimed expanding function in the redrafted ¡¬281_patent
thus the original disclaimer does not carry over to limit the range of equivalents here and does not negate the district_courts anticipation finding.9

`` in communication with' and` at least a substantial_portion' the universitys remaining two challenges to the district_courts anticipation analysis pertain to the requirement that` at least a substantial_portion of the central_portion of the first_member' be` in communication with at least a substantial_portion of the second_member'
see regents 835 f.supp.2d at 716
the district *946 court construed this claim to require that substantial_portions of the central_portions of the members communicated` movement'
see id.at 721
the university styles its arguments as challenges to the district_courts application of this claim_construction but they are essentially indirect objections to the claim_construction itself which the university did not raise to the district_court

first the university contends that the district_court wrongly allowed translational_movement communicated between locks members to satisfy the claim_limitation
the university argues that the members are required to communicate expansion or contraction_movement not translational_movement
but the district_court correctly stated that its claim_construction placed no restriction whatsoever on the type of movement required by the claim
id
(` [ t ] he courts claim_construction says nothing aboutexpansion or contraction_movement ; it refers tomovement plain and simple`
we agree with the district_court that the universitys interpretation of the claim_limitation is inconsistent with the district_courts construction
if the university objected to that construction it should have presented its objection and its alternative_construction to the district_court
but the universitys claim_construction briefs including supplemental briefs directed specifically to the phrase` in communication with' never argued that the correct construction required a particular type of movement
the university has therefore waived any objection to this aspect of the district_courts construction and can not advance a new reading of the claim_language indirectly on appeal
see e.g. digital-vending 672 f.3d at 1273

the universitys second argument fares no better
the universitys argument appears to be that the` central_portion' of each member must fill the septal_defect and that locks hub does not satisfy this requirement
however the plain_language of the asserted_claims does not support this reading and the district_courts claim_construction does not require it
despite multiple opportunities to offer briefing on this limitation the university never objected to this aspect of the district_courts construction or argued for an alternative_construction including this requirement ; it is therefore barred from making this argument on appeal.10 we conclude that the district_court did not err in finding that the lock_device satisfied all limitations of the asserted_claims

because the district_court properly concluded that lock anticipates the asserted_claims 1 4_and_5 of the ¡¬281_patent we affirm the district_courts grant of summary_judgment of invalidity to aga with respect to those claims

affirmed

during prosecution of the european counterpart to the patents-in-suit the university distinguished a prior_art russian device by asserting that a device` made in one piece with a tubular part.. does not comprise two disks with a central_portion of a first_disk being affixed to a central_portion of the second_disk'
regents 660 f.supp.2d at 1045
the university contends that its position on appeal is not inconsistent with those representations because` [ i ] t was the absence of occluding disks joined i.e. affixed in the area of their respective central_portions-not the unitary or non-unitary construction.. that was being discussed'
appellants br
29
while we do not find it necessary to rely on the european proceedings the position taken by the university in those proceedings only supports the conclusion that as a matter of common sense a device defined as two disks affixed together to form a conjoint_disk can not also be a one-piece tubular structure

the prosecution_history establishes unequivocally that the university understood the amendment to claim 1 to have effectively traversed the rejection over king
in response to the next office action which rejected claims 18_and_27 as anticipated by king the university amended those claims in the same_way as it had amended claim 1 as noted above applicant has.. amended claims 18_and_27 to replace the phrase` carried about the periphery' with` extending along and attached adjacent to the periphery'
aside from a myriad of other distinctions in the use and structure of these devices applicant respectfully submits that the radially extending arms employed by king do not extend about the periphery of the` membrane' taught therein

the sole exception is when the disclaimer is directed to the scope of the invention as a whole not a particular claim
see e.g. ormco corp. v. align tech. inc. 498_f.3d_1307 1314-15 fed.cir.2007 the patentees statements` w [ ere ] not associated with particular language from [ the ] claims' but were instead directed to the` present_invention' and the` overall method' claimed
in circumstances closely analogous to this case this court has held that` the alleged disclaimer distinguishing the prior_art focused on a particular claim_limitation.. and was not directed to the invention as a whole'
saunders_grp. 492 f.3d at 1333
in this case the universitys statements and amendments were directed to specific claims pertaining to the framed embodiments not to the overall invention
the university does not contend that its representations restricted the scope of its invention` as a whole'
9
the university also argues that the specification of the ¡¬281_patent disclaims locks radial_frame
but the ¡¬281 specification only expresses concern about using radial_arms to hold the expanded device in place against the septum of the beating heart
it does not disavow the use of a radial_frame to move the device from a compressed_orientation to an expanded orientation upon deployment
10
the university also seems to suggest that in the lock_device the area of attachment between the two members is too small to be a` substantial_portion'
but the district_court rightly rejected this argument because the claim_construction only requires that the members` transmit movement [ ] between a substantial_portion of their central_portions' and` a reasonable_jury would have to find that [ locks ] umbrellas communicate by way of their central attachment point over a substantial_portion of their central_portions'
