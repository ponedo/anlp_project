aventis_pharmaceuticals inc. and albany_molecular_research inc. amri collectively` appellants' appeal a stipulated judgment of noninfringement entered by the u.s. district court for the district of new_jersey
the parties stipulated to noninfringement following the district_courts markman_opinion of january 13 2011 which consolidated numerous patent infringement cases and construed terms of amris u.s._patent_no._5750,703` the ¡¬703_patent` among others.1 because we conclude that the district_courts markman_opinion misinterpreted claim_terms of the ¡¬ 703 patent we reverse and remand

i
background
this case concerns the processes used to make various piperidine_derivatives which are commonly used as active_ingredients in *1366 antihistamines
dr. thomas e. d'ambra amris president found the prior_art_processes for making piperidine_derivatives inefficient
because one goal of dr._d'ambras work was to obtain substantially pure piperidine_derivative_compounds-ultimately required for pharmaceutical-grade_end_products ; that is end_products with greater than 98 %_purity-he recognized that the reduced purity achieved through known teachings meant additional purification steps were required after the piperidine_derivative was fully formed leading to low yields
the prior_art_processes in short were costly and time consuming

dr._d'ambras invention overcame the deficiencies in the prior_art by synthesizing piperidine_derivatives using piperidine and cyclopropylketone` cpk' intermediates at an earlier_stage in the reaction
the processes developed by dr._d'ambra have the stated advantage of more readily separating out a substantially pure piperidine_derivative_end_product if desired
dr._d'ambra claimed these novel methods in his ¡¬703_patent2 fexofenadine a specific piperidine_derivative can be synthesized using these methods
see ¡¬703_patent_col. 26_ll._17 -33 claim 7

dr._d'ambra eventually assigned the ¡¬703_patent to amri.3 sanofi-aventis u.s. the exclusive licensee uses the patented_processes to produce large quantities of fexofenadine which is the active_ingredient in its antihistamines marketed under the brand name allegrathe_r and allegra-dthe_r 24 hour
the issues relevant to this appeal gravitate around claims 1 6 and 7 of the ¡¬703_patent

a
technical background
1
independent claim 1 of the ¡¬703_patent
a
the patented process generally
as its title suggests the ¡¬703_patent describes processes for synthesizing piperidine_derivatives
see supra note 2
claim 1 of the ¡¬703 the only independent claim in suit describes a process of preparing a piperidine_derivative using a cpk_intermediate and a piperidine intermediate
the structure of the piperidine_derivative to be prepared as an end_product is provided in claim 1 of the ¡¬703_patent as

?
¡¬703_patent_col. 23_ll._47 -61
in the above depiction r1 is a hydrogen or hydroxyl group r2 is a hydrogen group,4 r3 is a -cooh carboxylic acid or -coor4 carboxylic acid ester group and r4 is a hydrocarbon chain with one-to-six carbon_atoms
?
*1367 with a cpk_intermediate of the general structure
?
where a r1 r2 and r3 are defined as described for the piperidine_derivative_product
see e.g. ¡¬703_patent_col. 24_ll._10 -17 22-34
the cpk_intermediate exists in one of two predominant regioisomeric states:5 either para-cpk or meta-cpk.6 the para-cpk_intermediate_regioisomer has the two aromatic_ring_substituents located on carbons 1_and_4 on directly opposite sides of the aromatic_ring
the meta-cpk_intermediate_regioisomer has the two aromatic_ring_substituents located on carbons 1_and_3 in a nonlinear orientation
the different regioisomeric forms are depicted below

?
the difference between these regioisomeric arrangements of constituents on both the cpk_intermediate and piperidine_derivative_product appears slight but is biologically significant-the piperidine_derivative produced using the para-cpk_structure is biologically active while the piperidine_derivative produced using the meta-cpk_structure is biologically inactive
the ¡¬703_patent extensively criticizes the prior_art_processes because each stage of the synthesis yields an impure mixture of meta- and para-regioisomers
but the new process invented by dr._d'ambra using a cpk_intermediate means that the para/meta cpk regioisomeric mixture is more readily separable to obtain para-cpk resulting in a substantially pure_para-piperidine_derivative_end_product

b
`` substantially pure' claim 1 of the ¡¬703_patent reads in its entirety 1
a process of preparing a piperidine_derivative_compound of the formula

?
*1368 wherein
r1 is hydrogen or hydroxyl ; r2 is hydrogen ; or r1 and r2 taken together form a second bond between the carbon_atoms bearing r1 and r2 ; r3 is -cooh or -coor4 ; rbig_token__4_has_1__big_token to 6 carbon_atoms ; a b and d are the substituents of their aromatic_rings each of which may be different or the same and are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen halogens alkyl hydroxyl alkoxy or other substituents said process comprising ; providing a substantially pure_regioisomer of the following formula ?
converting the substantially pure_regioisomer to the piperidine_derivative_compound with a piperidine compound of the formula ?
¡¬703_patent_col. 23_l._45 to col. 24_l._35_(claim_1) emphases added
there are two notable features of claim 1 of the ¡¬703_patent
first the piperidine_derivative_end_product synthesized through the claimed process covers a broad range of potential piperidine_derivatives as components a b and d-substituents of the aromatic_rings-that can be selected from groups such as hydrogen halogens alkyl hydroxyl alkoxy or other groups
¡¬703_patent_col. 23_ll._45 to col. 24_l._6
second and more importantly the ¡¬ 703 patent refers to a` substantially pure_regioisomer' of a specific formula
¡¬703_patent_col. 24_l._8
notwithstanding the term` substantially pure' is not defined anywhere in the specification as noted by the district_court

c. the` providing' and` converting' steps
the` providing' and` converting' steps of the method in claim 1 of the ¡¬ 703 patent are illuminated by dependent_claims 2 3 4 and 5 as well as the patent_specification
the dependent_claims and the specification *1369 examples teach multiple methods for` providing' the para-cpk_intermediate both as a substantially pure_para-cpk product or as a mixture of para-cpk and meta-cpk products
see e.g. ¡¬703_patent_col. 12_l._65 to col. 19_l._35_(specification) ; col. 24_l._35 to col. 25_l._62_(claims_2-5)
for example dependent_claims 2_and_3 describe an acylation and purification process that results in the recovery of the para-cpk_intermediate from a` second_mixture of regioisomers'
¡¬703_patent_col. 24_l._35 to col. 25_l._53_(claims_2-3)
example 2 of the specification on the other hand describes another` providing' teaching producing a` crude product' that is a mixture of para-cpk and meta-cpk that could be further purified to predominantly para-cpk
¡¬703_patent_col. 19_l._65 to col. 20_l._19
example 2 however never requires further regioisomeric purification to a specific_level
see id
in fact nowhere in the specification is any numeric value attached to the purity of the cpk_intermediate

`` converting' is the coupling reaction of the para-cpk to azacyclonol to create the end-product piperidine_derivative
again the specification describes multiple processes for performing the claimed step of` converting' the cpk_intermediate to a piperidine_derivative_compound
see ¡¬703_patent_col. 16_l._31 to 18_l._67
as with` providing' the cpk_intermediate the` converting' step does not indicate that the cpk_intermediate must be in a substantially pure_form or even provide any required level of purity

2
claim 6 of the patents-in-suit
while claim 1 describes a process for producing piperidine_derivatives through use of a cpk_intermediate generally claims 6_and_7 further specify the piperidine_derivative_end_product synthesized by the patented_process
dependent_claim 6 describes 6
a process according to claim 1 further comprising reducing the piperidine_derivative under conditions effective to form a hydroxylated piperidine_derivative of the formula

?
¡¬703_patent_col. 25_l._63 to col. 26_l._15_(claim_6)

3
claim 7 of the patents-in-suit
dependent_claim 7 further specifies the type of hydroxylated piperidine_derivative_end_product of claim 6-fexofenadine 7
a process according to claim 6 wherein the hydroxylated piperedine derivative has the formula

?
¡¬703_patent_col. 26_ll._16 -33 claim 7
thus claim 7 of the ¡¬703_patent produces an important active pharmaceutical ingredient and was the claim asserted against the generic manufacturers accused antihistamines

4
prior art processes
the background section of the ¡¬703_patent discusses in detail the prior_art_processes for making piperedine derivatives
*1370 the patented_process claimed in the ¡¬703_patent represented a significant improvement over these prior_art_processes in particular the method taught in u.s. patent no._4254,129` the ¡¬129_patent` which issued on march_3,_1981

the process disclosed in the ¡¬129_patent used a` friedel-crafts' reaction to arrive at a piperidine_derivative
see ¡¬703_patent_col. 2_ll._27 -41
the friedel-crafts reaction produced a statistical admixture termed the` second_mixture of aromatic_regioisomers' by the ¡¬703_patent containing 67 %_meta-isomer of the piperidine_derivative_end_product and 33 %_para-isomer of the piperidine_derivative_end_product:7

?
see e.g. ¡¬703_patent_col. 2_l._42 to col. 4_l._25
the` second_mixture of aromatic_regioisomers' could then be converted to a` third_mixture of regioisomers' of the following formula

?
¡¬703_patent col. 3_l._65 to col. 4_l._25

dr._d'ambra discovered in the course of attempting to replicate the teaching of the ¡¬129_patent that it was practically impossible to completely separate the para-isomer of the piperidine_derivative_product to pharmaceutical purity when using the ¡¬129_patents process
in order to improve the regioisomeric_purity more easily at an earlier_stage in the reaction d'ambra developed the patented_process discussed above ; in particular he discovered the novel use of the para-cpk_intermediate
by using his unique starting material a purer regioisomeric form of the cpk_intermediate the regioisomeric_purity of the end_product could be much higher than the 33 %_para-cpk produced by the ¡¬129_patents process
dr._d'ambra discovered a different process of synthesizing a piperidine_derivative_product to higher_regioisomeric_purity ; then by using recrystallization and other purification techniques he could attain pharmaceutical-grade fexofenadine at a much lower expense

*1371 b
procedural background
the larger procedural history is complex involving dozens of parties in twenty cases
it suffices to limit the discussion to defendant-appellees amino_chemicals_ltd. dipharma_francis sr.l. and dipharma_spa collectively` appellees'
appellees are generic_drug_manufacturers
amino chemicals had filed a drug master file that was referenced in abbreviated new drug applications` andas' of two former parties mylan pharmaceutical inc. and teva_pharmaceuticals_usa inc. which had sought food and drug administration` fda' approval to market antihistamines containing fexofenadine
similarly dipharma_francis and dipharma_spa are bulk-manufacture suppliers of mylan and teva
upon submission of the andas to the fda appellants timely brought several suits against the generic_drug_manufacturers in the new_jersey district_court alleging inter alia infringement of the ¡¬703_patent

the district_court performed a tentative_claim_construction in connection with a september 20 2005 motion for a preliminary_injunction filed after teva began marketing a generic fexofenadine drug
judge greenaways january 30 2006 opinion denied the preliminary_injunction request and set forth an initial claim_construction of the ¡¬703_patents disputed claim_term` substantially pure'
see aventis_pharms. inc. v. barr labs. inc. 411_f.supp.2d_490 509 d.n.j.2006
the district_court found that the ¡¬703_patents specification used the phrase` substantially pure' to describe both the piperidine_derivative_end_products and the cpk_intermediate
id.at 498-99
the district_court also relied on statements from the prosecution_history regarding the purity of the piperidine_derivative_end_products to reach a tentative_claim_construction that the phrase` substantially pure' in the asserted claims of the ¡¬703_patent means` of greater than 95 %_purity'
id.at 502-03
the court extended this to describe not only the purity_level necessary of end_products but also the cpk_intermediate_compound
id
in declining to institute a preliminary_injunction based on the ¡¬703_patent the district_court did not reach the issue of whether` substantially pure' describes overall chemical purity as to everything in the compound or whether the term is limited to regioisomeric_purity i.e. the purity only of the para-isomer relative to unwanted meta-isomer
id.at 508

the parties thereafter filed opening and responsive claim_construction briefs and on november 10 2010 a markman hearing was held before chief judge brown
the markman opinion issued on january 13 2010 construing two terms from the ¡¬703_patent relevant here
joint_app x 41 ; see also aventis_pharms. inc. v. impax labs. inc. nos._02-1322 03-1179 03-1180 03-5108 03-5829 04-1075 04-1076 04-1077 04-1078 04-2305 04-3194 05-4255 06-5463 07-5054 07-5180 09-0325 09-4638 09-5179 10-1471 2011_wl_2175928 at *1 d.n.j
jan._31,_2011 publically available markman_opinion

from claim 1 of the ¡¬703_patent the district_court construed the terms` substantially pure_regioisomer of the following formula

?
and` substantially pure'
the district_court held that neither the claims nor the specification give sufficient specific guidance as to the meaning of either claim_term
the trial court found however that the specification` indiscriminately' equates the purity of the intermediates and final_products to such an extent that there is no *1372 justification to differentiate between` substantially pure' para-cpk_intermediates and` substantially pure' piperidine_derivative_end_products
according to the court` [ b ] ecause the specification uses the same_term consistently for both intermediates and derivatives the court finds that whatsubstantially pure means when it modifies the piperidine_derivative applies equally to its context in the claimssubstantially pure_regioisomer of the formula
`` joint_app x 49 ; see also aventis 2011_wl_2175928 at *5

regarding what` substantially pure' actually means when applied to both the cpk_intermediate and piperidine_derivative_end_product the district_court was forced to rely on the prosecution_history of the ¡¬703_patent as well as the prosecution_history of the related_u.s._patent_no._5578,610 filed june_24,_1993` the ¡¬610_patent` which is another divisional descended from the parent 08/083,102 application
the district_court determined through the prosecution_history that` the inventor understood the termsubstantially pure to mean 98 %_purity and that the inventor clearly and unambiguously disavowed any other claim scope'
joint_app x 52 ; see also aventis 2011_wl_2175928 at *7

to arrive at this particularly high level of purity the district_court cited to a statement made by dr._d'ambra during the ¡¬610_patent interference in 1997
there dr._d'ambra allegedly stated several times that` substantially pure' meant pharmaceutical-grade or 98 % purity of end_products for consumption
from this-despite acknowledging that the statements were likely only describing end-products-the district_court concluded that` it is clear that bysubstantially pure the patentee meant pharmaceutical-grade_purity which requires an impurity_level no greater than 2 %
these statements both explain the meaning the patentee assigned tosubstantially pure and represent a clear disclaimer of patent scope for his patent'
joint_app x 54 ; see also aventis 2011_wl_2175928 at *8
thus by virtue of the specifications nondiscrimination between intermediates and end_products a 98 %_purity requirement was extended to the para-cpk_intermediate as well

finally with regard to` substantially pure' the court held that 98 %_purity refers to chemical impurities of any kind present in the product not just regioisomeric impurity
joint_app x 55` the plain_language of the termsubstantially pure is relative to all impurities-a solution of 25 %_para-cpk 0.2 %_meta-cpk and 74.8 %_dirt would not be substantially pure
`` ; see also aventis 2011_wl_2175928 at *8

in sum the district_court construed the relevant terms at issue from the ¡¬ 703 patent so that 1` substantially pure' means` at least 98 %_purity with respect to all impurities' and 2` providing regioisomer of the following formula

?
means` the regioisomer having the structure shown in the formula is present in at least 98 %_purity with respect to all impurities'
joint_app x 65 ; see also aventis 2011_wl_2175928 at *13
in light of this claim_construction appellants stipulated that they could no longer prove infringement and the district_court entered final_judgment in favor of appellees in both cases
appellants timely appealed the disputed claim_construction of the ¡¬703_patent to this court
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

discussion
claim construction is an issue of law since markman v. westview instruments *1373 inc. 52_f.3d_967 981 fed.cir.1995 en banc affd 517_u.s._370 116_s.ct._1384 134_l.ed.2d_577_(1996)
this court reviews district_court claim_constructions de novo
cybor corp. v. fas techs. inc. 138_f.3d_1448 1456 fed.cir.1998 en banc

`` it is a bedrock principle of patent law that the claims of a patent define the invention to which the patentee is entitled the right to exclude'
phillips v. awh corp. 415_f.3d_1303 1312 fed.cir.2005 en banc internal quotation marks omitted
there is a heavy presumption that claim_terms are to be given their ordinary and customary_meaning
id.at 1312-13 ; vitronics corp. v. conceptronic inc. 90_f.3d_1576 1582 fed.cir.1996
courts are required therefore to` look to the words of the claims themselves.. to define the scope of the patented invention'
id
; see also toro co. v. white consol
indus. inc. 199_f.3d_1295 1299 fed.cir.1999

claims however must be construed in light of the appropriate context in which the claim_term is used
see toro 199 f.3d at 1299
the written description and other parts of the specification for example may shed contextual light on the plain and ordinary_meaning ; however they can not be used to narrow a claim_term to deviate from the plain and ordinary_meaning unless the inventor acted as his own lexicographer or intentionally disclaimed or disavowed claim scope
id.at 1316 ; cf
markman 52 f.3d at 980` [ t ] he written description part of the specification itself does not delimit the right to exclude
that is the function and purpose of claims`
the prosecution_history too as part of the intrinsic_record has an important role in claim_construction by supplying context to the claim language
while the prosecution_history` lacks the clarity of the specification and thus is less useful for claim_construction purposes' phillips 415 f.3d at 1317 it still provides evidence of how the inventor intended the term to be construed
see lemelson v. gen. mills inc. 968_f.2d_1202 1206 fed.cir.1992

a
`` substantially pure' claims 1 6 and 7 of the ¡¬703_patent explicitly include the term` substantially pure_regioisomer'
the district_court construed this language to require` at least 98 %_purity with respect to all impurities'
this construction however conflates the purity required for the piperidine_end_product with that of the cpk_intermediate

1
cpk intermediate versus piperidine end product
we agree with both parties that the claims themselves are insufficient to define the term` substantially pure'
therefore we must turn to other sources of intrinsic_evidence to determine` what the inventors actually invented and intended to envelop with the claim'
renishaw plc v. marposs societa per azioni 158_f.3d_1243 1250 fed.cir.1998
the specification provides the` best source' for construing a claim_term and determining the inventors intent regarding use
multiform dessicants inc. v. medzam ltd. 133_f.3d_1473 1478 fed.cir.1998 ; see also vitronics 90 f.3d at 1582

in this case the specification does not provide an explicit definition of the term` substantially pure' or` substantially pure_regioisomer'
the district_court determined that because the term` substantially pure' is used indiscriminately with regards to the cpk_intermediate and the piperidine_derivative_end_product throughout the specification` substantially pure' should have only one construction throughout the patent
the` one construction throughout the patent' rule adopted by the district_court is incorrect

*1374 we have previously held that the same_claim_term can have different_constructions depending upon the context of how the term is used within the claims and specification
see microprocessor_enhancement_corp. v. tex
instruments inc. 520_f.3d_1367 1375 fed.cir.2008 holding that while there is a presumption that a claim_term will be construed consistently when used throughout the claims there is no requirement that a claim_term be construed uniformly particularly if it would lead to a` nonsensical reading'
in epcon gas systems inc. v. bauer_compressors inc. 279_f.3d_1022_(fed.cir.2002) for example we construed the term` substantially' to have different_interpretations based on a` subtle but significant difference' in context and usage
id.at 1030-31

while` substantially pure' refers to both the cpk_intermediate and the piperidine_derivative_end_product in the specification the term` substantially pure' is used only in reference to the cpk_intermediate in relevant_claims 1 6 and 7
and unlike other patents in the family there is no explicit` substantially pure' limitation placed on the piperidine_derivative_end_product in the relevant_claims of the ¡¬703_patent
the lack of any` substantially pure' limitation on the piperidine_derivative_end_products in claims 1 6 and 7 obviates any explicit requirement to apply a construction of` substantially pure' that is consistent for both the cpk_intermediate and the piperidine_derivative_end_product

further a person of ordinary_skill in the art would recognize that an intermediate of the claimed chemical reaction would not be required to have the same purity as the end_product
as mentioned in the specification both in reference to the prior_art ¡¬129_patent and also throughout the examples various crystallization and purification processes are available to purify the piperidine_derivative_end_product to reach pharmaceutical-grade_purity after synthesis
the ¡¬703_patent represents an improvement over the prior_art_processes
the improvement was not that the patented_technique could guarantee a piperidine_derivative of pharmaceutical purity absent further purification ; the improvement was that the patented_technique could provide a piperidine_derivative_end_product of higher_regioisomeric_purity requiring less extensive purification than the end_product derived by the process of the ¡¬129_patent8 reading` substantially pure' to require a consistent construction for the cpk_intermediate and piperidine_derivative_end_product ignores the distinct contexts in which these terms are used

appellees argue that reading a common term to have different_meanings in different_contexts does not apply here to the interpretation of` substantially pure'
they distinguish epcon and microprocessor because the patents in those cases contained intrinsic_records which clearly and expressly supported multiple interpretations for a single claim_term
appellees maintain that no such clear and express support is found in the ¡¬703_patent_specification at issue
but this ignores that we must always construe the specification in light of the knowledge of one of ordinary_skill in the art
phillips 415 f.3d at 1313
through basic knowledge of chemical reactions and purification schemes a skilled artisan would recognize that the purity of an intermediate_compound in a reaction is often not equivalent to the purity of the end_product especially when further common physical purification steps may be *1375 necessary
interpreting this specification in light of the knowledge of a person of ordinary_skill in the art we hold that a proper construction requires different_interpretations of` substantially pure' when applied to the cpk_intermediate and piperidine_derivative_end_product

the` one-size-fits-all' construction adopted by the district_court incorrectly construes` substantially pure' separate from the very next word-' regioisomer'
the district_courts artificial truncation of the claim_term for the expediency of a single_interpretation across different_contexts was error
outside of the description of the prior_art process from the ¡¬129_patent the specification almost exclusively uses the term` regioisomer' to refer to the cpk_intermediate
further the full term` substantially pure_regioisomer' is used only in reference to the cpk_intermediate
see ¡¬703_patent_col. 5_ll._11 -12 23 40-41 ; col. 12_ll._32 -33 43 62-66 ; col. 13_ll._55 -56 ; col. 13_l._67 to col. 14_ll._37 -38 51 53 ; col. 15_ll._13 -14 51-52 54 ; col. 16_ll._21 -22 25-26 31-32 34-35 49 ; col. 18_ll._4 -5 7-8
such uniform use of` substantially pure_regioisomer' taken as a whole exposes the error of the district_court by decoupling the modifier` substantially pure' from` regioisomer' for purposes of claim_construction the district_court imposed a single_interpretation even though that context requires separate definitions of` substantially pure' when applied to the cpk_intermediate as opposed to the piperidine_derivative_end_product
we thus conclude that the district_court erred in requiring that` substantially pure' have the same interpretation when applied to the cpk_intermediate and the piperidine_derivative_end_product

construction of` substantially pure regioisomer' although it was error for the district_court to limit the construed term to encompass both the cpk_intermediate and the piperidine_derivative_end_product the proper term to construe` substantially pure_regioisomer' still requires claim_construction
the presumption is that claim_terms should be given their` ordinary and customary_meaning' vitronics 90 f.3d at 1582 and not a restrictive construction unless there is clear evidence to support it in the intrinsic_evidence or a broader meaning is specifically disclaimed during prosecution
see saunders grp. inc. v. comfortrac inc. 492_f.3d_1326 1331 fed.cir.2007
a court can look to the prosecution_history of related patents for guidance in claim_construction
see ormco corp. v. align tech. inc. 498_f.3d_1307 1314 fed.cir.2007

the district_court interpreted` substantially pure' in isolation to mean` at least 98 %_purity with respect to all impurities' based in large part on the prosecution_history of the related_¡¬610_patent
the district_court looked to statements made during the ¡¬610_patents interference_proceedings before the u.s. patent and trademark office pto where the patentee stated that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would understand` substantially pure' in claims 1-17 to refer to pharmaceutical-grade_purity
claims 1-17 include claims such as claim 12 where` substantially pure' modifies only the cpk_intermediate
on that basis the district_court concluded here that` substantially pure' as applied to the cpk_intermediate required` at least 98 %_purity with respect to all impurities'

in analyzing the claims of the ¡¬703_patent we find statements made in the ¡¬610_patents interference_proceedings of little help
the patentee and the pto both explicitly noted that the focus of the ¡¬610_patents interference was limited to interpreting the claims in reference to the piperidine_end_product
even the statements *1376 made by dr._d'ambra9 were made specifically in regards to the` subject_compound' of the interference which was only the end_product
at most the construction of` substantially pure' derived from the ¡¬610_patents interference applies to the piperidine_derivative_end_product not the cpk_intermediate at issue in this case
since we have found that` substantially pure' has different_constructions when applied to the cpk_intermediate and the piperidine_end_product in the ¡¬703_patent there is no justification for applying the definition of` substantially pure' from the ¡¬610_patents interference to` substantially pure_regioisomer' in the ¡¬703_patent

in determining the scope of the claim_term` pure' the district_court further assumed that` substantially pure' must apply to all impurities present in solution not just regioisomeric_purity
the district_court reasoned that the plain_language of` substantially pure' must involve all impurities because` a solution of 25 %_para-cpk 0.2 %_meta-cpk and 74.8 %_dirt would not be substantially pure'
joint_app x 55 ; see also aventis 2011_wl_2175928 at *8
this flawed analysis again does not consider the appropriate frame of reference for claim_construction
a person of ordinary_skill in the art would recognize that the ¡¬703_patent improved the regioisomeric_purity of the end_product that results from the claimed reaction as compared to the friedel-crafts acylation disclosed in the ¡¬129_patent
for example in the district_courts hypothetical mixture` of 25 %_para-cpk 0.2 %_meta-cpk and 74.8 %_dirt' the patented reaction could very well produce 25 %_para-piperidine_derivative_end_product 0.2 %_meta-piperidine_derivative_end_product and 74.8 %` dirt'
the` dirt' could then be removed through simple purification processes such as crystallization leaving 99.2 %_para-piperidine_derivative_end_product and 0.8 %_meta-piperidine_derivative_end_product
such an end_product mixture would arrive at the standard for pharmaceutical-grade_purity even though the` dirt' represented a substantial impurity in the early stages of the reaction
again the weakness in the ¡¬129_patent was its inability to produce an end_product with a 125:1 ratio10 of para- to meta-piperidine_derivative or even anything approaching such a ratio
it was this inherent deficiency of the ¡¬ 129 patents process in regioisomeric_purity that the ¡¬703_patent improved upon
further the processes disclosed in the ¡¬129 andbig_token__¡¬703_patent__big_token s consider the need for further purification steps after the claimed reactions
while these purification steps will help improve the ratio of para- to meta-piperidine product they will also remove other reaction impurities
therefore the general purity of other reaction components in the cpk-mixture is largely irrelevant at the intermediate stage
the district_court actually recognized this point to a lesser extent noting that` with respect to all impurities' does not include` intended elements of solutions such as solvents catalysts and other_compounds'
we hold that the modifier` substantially pure' when construed in light of a person of ordinary_skill in the art and in view of the claimed improvements over the prior_art only applies regioisomeric_impurities not all impurities

*1377 3
appellants construction
with no explicit construction of the term` substantially pure' in the claims specification or prosecution_history we apply the` ordinary and customary' definition to the claim_term
in other contexts this court has interpreted` substantially' as a non-specific term of approximation that avoids a numerical_boundary
see e.g. playtex prods. inc. v. procter & gamble_co. 400_f.3d_901 907 fed.cir.2005 ; liquid dynamics corp. v. vaughan co. 355_f.3d_1361 1368 fed.cir.2004` the termsubstantial is a meaningful modifier implyingapproximate rather thanperfect
`` ; cordis_corp. v. medtronic_ave inc. 339_f.3d_1352 1360 fed.cir.2003 ; ecolab inc. v. envirochem inc. 264_f.3d_1358 1366-67 fed.cir.2001

in the context of` substantially pure' as applied to a cpk_intermediate` substantially' would also not be amenable to a numerical_boundary
the ¡¬703_patent implies that the regioisomeric_purity should be greater than 67 % ¡¬703_patent_col. 4_ll._15 -25 but the patent_specification tellingly does not list any necessary minimum purity for the cpk_intermediate in order to produce a desired piperidine_derivative_end_product with pharmaceutical-grade_purity
as described in the patent a piperidine_derivative_end_product with a regioisomeric_purity below 98 % can be purified through crystallization or other physical techniques to reach pharmaceutical-grade_purity showing that the cpk_intermediate does not itself need to be at a regioisomeric_purity of 98 % or higher
¡¬703_patent_col. 13_l._55 to col. 14_l._14

appellants propose that` substantially pure_regioisomer of the following formula' should be construed as` largely but not wholly the para_regioisomer of the intermediate of the structure shown as compared to the meta isomer'
appellants br
10
this construction of` substantially' was previously applied with approval in ecolab 264 f.3d at 1366 noting that websters ninth new collegiate dictionary 1176 9th ed
1983 defines` substantially' to mean` largely but not wholly that which is specified'
`` largely but not wholly' is consistent with a flexible approach to regioisomeric_purity for an intermediate is faithful to the specifications silence regarding numerical precision and most importantly is not arbitrarily tied to the fda standard for pharmaceutical-grade_end_products
no one ingests the intermediate_compound so there is no reason to impose end-product purity on it
therefore we adopt the appellants proposed construction of` substantially pure_regioisomer of the following formula' as used in the ¡¬703_patent and construe the term to mean` largely but not wholly the para_regioisomer of the intermediate of the structure shown as compared to the meta isomer'

bryson circuit_judge dissenting
the majority concludes that the district_court erred in its construction of the term` substantially pure' in claim 1 of u.s._patent_no._5750,703` the ¡¬703_patent` and therefore reverses the district_courts judgment
i would uphold the district_courts construction of that term and i therefore respectfully dissent

i
the district_court construed the term` substantially pure' to mean` at least 98 % *1378 purity with respect to all impurities'
in arriving at that construction the court first determined that` substantially pure' has the same_meaning whether it refers to the piperidine_derivative_end_product or the para-cpk_intermediate
the court noted that the` inventor uses the phrasessubstantially pure andsubstantially pure_regioisomers indiscriminately to refer to both final_products and intermediates
there is no evidence that the inventor intended the term to mean different_things'
based on the prosecution_histories of the ¡¬703_patent and related_u.s._patent_no._5578,610` the ¡¬610_patent`1 the court then held that the term` substantially pure' refers to pharmaceutical_grade_purity i.e. 98 % pure
finally the court determined that the required purity_level was to be measured with respect to all impurities not just the unwanted meta-cpk except that the 98 %_purity_level did not include` intended elements of solutions such as solvents catalysts or other_compounds that are not considered impurities'

aventiss primary argument on appeal is that the term` substantially pure' should be given a different_meaning when it refers to the para-cpk_intermediate which the claim describes as a` substantially pure_regioisomer' of cpk than when it refers to the piperidine_derivative_end_product
aventis essentially concedes that if the term at issue were` substantially pure end_product' 98 %_purity with respect to all impurities would be an accurate construction
but since the term` substantially pure' is used in claim 1 to refer to the` substantially pure_regioisomer' -i.e. the para-cpk_intermediate-aventis argues that a different construction is required
aventis contends that the evidence relied upon by the district_court pertained only to the purity of the end_product and that the term` substantially pure' has a different_meaning when used to refer to intermediates than when used to refer to end_products
as used in reference to the regioisomer aventis argues that the term` substantially pure' means` largely but not wholly [ para-cpk ] as compared to [ meta-cpk ]'

the majority embraces aventiss proposed construction holding that the patent gives the term` substantially pure' different_meanings when referring to the terms` substantially pure_regioisomer' and` substantially pure_piperidine_derivative'
as the district_court ruled however the intrinsic_evidence does not distinguish between the way` substantially pure' is used with respect to those two terms and for that reason i would uphold the district_courts claim_construction

in seeking to distinguish between the meaning of the term` substantially pure' when it is applied to the intermediate regioisomer as opposed to when it is applied to the piperidine_derivative_end_product aventis relies on the argument that one of ordinary_skill in the art would know that the purity of intermediates may be different from the purity of end_products and it offers expert_testimony in support of that proposition
but even if a person of ordinary_skill in the art would not necessarily regard purity as meaning the same_thing for an intermediate as for an end_product the analysis does not end there

in at least two places the intrinsic_record uses the term` substantially pure' in the same way with regard to the regioisomer and the end_product
first the specification states although the second_mixture of regioisomers [ an intermediate ] and the third_mixture of regioisomers [ the final piperidine *1379 derivative product ] can be analyzed by hplc experiments a practical separation to obtain gram quantities of substantially pure_regioisomers has not been achieved
each mixture including the first [ also an intermediate ] would be expected to contain 33 % of the para isomer and 67 % of the meta isomer
since these components are inseparable it has not been possible to obtain either of the regioisomers in each [ first second and third ] mixture in substantially pure_form
¡¬703_patent at col. 4_ll._16 -24 emphasis added
second in an interference involving the related_¡¬610_patent the patentee wrote when read in light of the specification one skilled in the art would have understood that the phrase` substantially pure' as used in claims 1-17 of the d'ambra patent [ the ¡¬610_patent ] to mean that the subject_compound has pharmaceutical_grade_purity and is in a form purer than that attained by the prior_art e.g. u.s. patent nos._4254,129 4,254,130 4,285,957 and 4,285,958 to carr collectively` the carr_patents'
as demonstrated infra those skilled in the art recognized that pharmaceutical_grade_purity requires an impurity_level no greater than 2 % and the carr_patents were unable to achieve such purity

importantly that response refers to claims 1-17 of the ¡¬610_patent ; one of those claims claim 12 recites` a piperidine_derivative_compound produced by a process comprising providing a substantially pure_regioisomer..' emphasis added

aventis concedes that in the first passage the patentee failed to distinguish between the use of` substantially pure' as applied to an intermediate and to an end_product but it claims that the passage is irrelevant because it concerns the prior_art carr process
in fact however both the discussion of the prior_art and the discussion of the claimed invention use the term` substantially pure' when referring to regioisomers ; one of the` mixture [ s ]' referenced in the second paragraph is cpk while another is the piperidine_end_product
thus the patentee fails to distinguish between` substantially pure_regioisomer' and` substantially pure [ end_product ]' and in fact affirmatively suggests that the meaning of` substantially pure' does not turn on whether it modifies` regioisomer' or` piperidine_derivative [ end_product ]'

regarding the second reference aventis argues that it is clear in context that the passage concerns the purity of the end_product
aventis also argues that the` subject_compound' described in that passage is the end_product making clear that the discussion of` substantially pure' in that passage applies only to the end_product
the problem with aventiss position is that the quoted language expressly refers to`substantially pure.. as used in claims 1-17' and claim 12 of the ¡¬610_patent refers to a` substantially pure_regioisomer'
thus`substantially pure.. as used in claims 1-17' unequivocally includes` substantially pure_regioisomer'
that reference thus rebuts aventiss claim that the patentee was careful to distinguish between` substantially pure_regioisomer' and` substantially pure_piperidine_derivative [ end_product ]'
the patentee could have written`substantially pure_piperidine_derivative.. as used in claims 1-17' but it chose not to referring only to`substantially pure.. as used in claims 1-17'
those two examples show that the patentee did not intend for the term` substantially pure' to have a different_meaning depending on whether it was describing an intermediate or an end_product

beyond those two passages the intrinsic_record provides little else of help in construing *1380 the term` substantially pure'
however general principles of claim_construction are instructive here
`` [ w ] e presume unless otherwise compelled that the same_claim_term in the same patent or related patents carries the same construed meaning'
omega_eng g inc. v. raytek corp. 334_f.3d_1314 1334 fed.cir.2003 ; see also paragon solutions llc v. timex corp. 566_f.3d_1075 1087 fed.cir.2009` we apply a presumption that the same_terms appearing in different_portions of the claims should be given the same_meaning unless it is clear from the specification and prosecution_history that the terms have different_meanings at different_portions of the claims`
starting with the presumption that` substantially pure' means the same_thing when describing` regioisomer' as it does when describing` piperidine_derivative' it is clear that aventis has not put forth` compell [ ing ]' evidence to the contrary.2 indeed as noted above the intrinsic_record supports the district_courts finding that` substantially pure' has the same_meaning throughout the patent and aventis has pointed to nothing compelling in the record to suggest otherwise.3 aventiss reliance on expert_testimony that one of ordinary_skill in the art would know that` substantially pure' can mean different_things when describing intermediates than when describing end_products is not enough to overcome the persuasive intrinsic_record in this case
see kara tech inc. v. stamps.com inc. 582_f.3d_1341 1348 fed.cir.2009` while helpful extrinsic sources like expert_testimony can not overcome more persuasive intrinsic_evidence
``

aventiss expert_testimony does not indicate that` substantially pure_regioisomer' is a term of art that connotes a specific_level of purity relative to that of the end_product
thus although` substantially pure' certainly could have different_meanings in different_contexts there is no evidence indicating that it must mean something different when used to describe a regioisomer as opposed to an end_product
the majority bases its construction of the term` substantially pure_regioisomer' on the general definition of the term` substantially' which is taken from an unrelated case that in turn cites a general dictionary definition
that appeal to extrinsic evidence from outside the art underscores the fact that aventis has offered nothing in the intrinsic_record or even in the state of the art to define the term that is the focus of the parties dispute
instead of resorting to extrinsic evidence as to the general meaning of the term` substantially' standing on its own we should interpret the claim_term that aventis did define` substantially pure'

there is no basis for ignoring the intrinsic_record and the presumption that` substantially pure' is a discrete claim_term with a consistent meaning throughout the *1381 patent
aventis apparently believes that for` substantially pure' to be construed to have the same_meaning each time it is used in the patent the patentee would have to explicitly` link' the purity of the para-cpk_intermediate to that of the end_product
but aventis has it backwards if the patentee wanted` substantially pure' to have different_meanings when applied to different elements it needed to explicitly` unlink' them

ii
aventiss other arguments are easily disposed of
it is clear and essentially undisputed that` substantially pure' means` at least 98 % pure' when describing end_product
in the prosecution_history of the ¡¬703_patent the applicant equated substantially pure_piperidine_derivative with` a purity_level suitable for pharmaceutical use'
the district_court found that` [ i ] t is essentially undisputed that pharmaceutically acceptable purity is 98 %'
the patentees statements made in the course of an interference_proceeding involving the ¡¬610_patent also support the district_courts conclusion that the term` substantially pure' as used in the ¡¬906_patent and its relatives means` at least 98 % pure'
in that interference_proceeding the patentee equated the term` substantially pure' with` pharmaceutical_grade_purity' and expressly agreed that` pharmaceutical_grade_purity requires an impurity_level no greater than 2 %'
the prosecution_histories also support the district_courts conclusion that the required purity_level referred to purity with respect to all impurities not just with respect to a single other component such as meta-cpk

aventis argues that this evidence is irrelevant because it pertains to the purity_level of the end_product
but because the patent does not distinguish between the meaning of` substantially pure' as applied to an end_product and as applied to an intermediate it follows that if a` substantially pure [ end_product ]' means a product that is at least 98 % pure with respect to all impurities then the same_meaning attaches to` substantially pure [ para-cpk ]'

the cases that aventis cites in support of its position are unhelpful to it
aventis cites several cases for the proposition that the term` substantially' need not have a strict numerical_boundary
e.g. playtex prods. inc. v. procter & gamble_co. 400_f.3d_901 907 fed.cir.2005 ; anchor wall sys
v. rockwood retaining walls inc. 340_f.3d_1298 1310-11 fed.cir.2003 ; cordis_corp. v. medtronic_ave inc. 339_f.3d_1352 1360 fed.cir.2003 ; ecolab inc. v. envirochem inc. 264_f.3d_1358 1366 fed.cir.2001
those cases have no application here however because in this case the intrinsic_evidence establishes that the term` substantially pure' was given a strict numerical meaning as the district_court found

in sum i conclude that` substantially pure' means` at least 98 %_purity with respect to all impurities' and that it has that meaning with respect to both regioisomers and the end_product
i would therefore affirm the district_courts judgment
