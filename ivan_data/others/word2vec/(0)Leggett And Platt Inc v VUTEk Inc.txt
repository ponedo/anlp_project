plaintiffs-appellants leggett & platt inc. and l & p property management co. collectively` l & p' sued defendant-appellee vutek inc.` vutek' alleging that certain of vuteks large-scale printers infringe claims 1-3 7 9-10 and 19 of l & ps u.s._patent_no._6755,518 the` ¡¬518_patent`
vutek filed a motion for summary_judgment alleging that the asserted claims of the ¡¬518_patent are invalid
the district_court granted vuteks motion finding claims 1 9 10 and 19 of the ¡¬518_patent to be anticipated by a prior vutek patent and claims 2 3 and 7 to be obvious in light of a combination of two prior vutek patents

dec. 26 2006` summary_judgment_order'
because we conclude that the district_court properly granted summary_judgment of invalidity we affirm

i
the ¡¬518_patent entitled` method and apparatus for ink jet printing on rigid panels' describes a method and apparatus for printing ink on a rigid deformable_substrate without causing the substrate to deform even temporarily
a deformable_substrate is a material that has a tendency to bend ripple warp or otherwise deform when it is exposed to radiant_energy such as heat or infrared` ir' radiation
to print on such a substrate the ¡¬518_patent describes the use of a` uv curable' ink-which can be cured i.e. dried by exposure to ultraviolet` uv' radiation-and a *1351` cold_uv' radiation_source
where some` hot' sources of uv_radiation will emit non-uv_radiation that can heat and deform the substrate a` cold_uv' radiation_source can substantially cure the ink without deforming the substrate
the ¡¬518_patent also teaches that shortly after the uv_curable_ink is deposited on the substrate the cold_uv_radiation_source` freezes' the ink in place to prevent the ink from spreading wicking or otherwise moving on the substrate
because the height of the substrate may vary the ¡¬518_patent also provides techniques for maintaining a constant distance between the ink_jets printheads and the substrate

in may 2005 l & p filed suit in the united_states_district_court for the eastern_district of missouri alleging that vuteks pressvu uv printers infringe l & ps ¡¬518_patent
specifically l & p alleged that vutek was infringing independent_claims 1_and_10 and dependent_claims 2 3 7 9 and 19 of the ¡¬518_patent
independent claim 1 is representative of these claims for the purposes of this appeal
it recites a method of ink_jet printing uv_curable_ink from an ink_jet printhead onto a rigid substrate formed of a material that has a tendency to at least temporarily deform in the direction of printhead if exposed to radiant curing energy while at a printing_station the method comprising moving a printhead carriage having an ink_jet printhead thereon approximately parallel to a substrate at a printing_station ; jetting ink from the head onto the surface of a substrate ; providing at least one cold_uv curing assembly on the carriage adjacent to and moveable with the printhead and oriented to direct_uv_energy onto the surface of the substrate at the printing_station sufficiently close to where ink is being jetted onto the surface to freeze dots of the jetted_ink on the surface ; and
the cold_uv_assembly being effective to impinge sufficient_uv_light on the ink to substantially cure the ink without impinging radiation that would heat the substrate so as to deform it even temporarily while at the printing_station
¡¬518_patent col.9 ll.6-25 emphases added

the district_court held a markman hearing in april 2006 and subsequently issued an order construing the disputed terms and phrases of the ¡¬518_patent
leggett & platt inc. v. vutek inc. no._405-cv-788 2006_wl_1479537_(e.d.miss._may_25,_2006)` markman_order'
three of these claim constructions are at issue on appeal 1 cold_uv 2 freeze dots of the jetted_ink and 3 substantially cure
first the district_court construed the claim term` cold_uv' to mean` an ultraviolet light source which i employs selected wavelengths to limit ; or ii has been adapted to selectively reduce the amount of ; radiation and thus heat that impinges upon a substrate'
id.at **2-3 *12
next the district_court ruled that the phrase` freeze dots of the jetted_ink' means` to sufficiently cure the dots of ink such that they will not spread wick or otherwise move on the substrate'
id.at *7 *12
finally the district_court construed the phrase` substantially cure' to mean` cured to a great_extent or almost completely cured'
id.at **7-8 *12

in october 2006 the parties filed cross motions for summary_judgment on the issue of infringement and vutek filed a motion for summary_judgment of invalidity
the district_court granted vuteks motion on invalidity and deemed the remaining motions moot
summary_judgment_order at 23-24
in its motion vutek asserted that claims 1-3 7 9-10 and 19 of the ¡¬518_patent are invalid because they are anticipated or obvious indefinite and lack written description
see *1352 id.at 1-2
the district_court found the asserted claims to be invalid on two of these grounds
id.at 2
first the district_court first concluded that claims 1 9 10 and 19 of the ¡¬518_patent are invalid as anticipated by vuteks u.s._patent_no._6457,823 the` ¡¬823_patent` and claims 2 3 and 7 are invalid as obvious in light of a combination of the ¡¬823_patent and vuteks u.s._patent_no._6616,355 the` ¡¬355_patent`
id.at 5-18
`` alternatively' the district_court` reluctantly' agreed that these claims are invalid as indefinite because the terms` deform deforming and deformation' which are present in each claim` are not capable of being construed in a way that meets the definiteness requirement of [ 35 u.s.c ] ¡± 112'
id.at 18-23

for these reasons the district_court granted vuteks motion for summary_judgment of invalidity
id.at 23
the district_court then entered final_judgment declaring claims 1-3 7 9-10 and 19 of the ¡¬518_patent invalid

as noted above the district_court found 1 claims 1 9 10 and 19 of the ¡¬518_patent to be anticipated by vuteks ¡¬823_patent and 2 claims 2 3 and 7 to be obvious in light of a combination of vuteks ¡¬823_patent and vuteks ¡¬355_patent
summary_judgment_order at 2 5-18
l & p appeals both findings
we turn first to whether the district_court erred in concluding that claims 1 9 10 and 19 are anticipated as a matter of law

as noted above claim 1 is representative for the purposes of l & ps arguments on appeal
it requires` at least one cold_uv curing assembly' that is` adjacent to and moveable with the printhead'
¡¬518_patent col.9 ll.15-16
it specifies that this cold_uv curing assembly is` oriented to direct_uv_energy.. to freeze dots of the jetted_ink' and` effective to impinge sufficient_uv_light on the ink to substantially cure the ink'
id.at col.9 ll.17-22
l & ps argument on appeal is that vuteks ¡¬823_patent fails to disclose these claimed aspects and thus can not anticipate

the ¡¬823_patent describes a printer_carriage that includes one or more inkjet printheads and one or more uv_radiation_sources for setting ink after it has been deposited onto a substrate
¡¬823_patent col.3 ll.59-66 col.4 ll.60-64
these uv_radiation_sources may be light emitting diodes` leds' id.at col.2 ll.4-12 which the parties agree qualify as` cold_uv' see summary_judgment_order at 7
the ¡¬823_patent teaches that these uv_radiation_sources should emit enough energy to` set' the deposited ink when the carriage is operating at the fastest possible speed i.e. 50 watts per inch1 ¡¬823_patent col.5 ll.3-16
deposited ink is` set' or pre-cured *1353` so that the ink does not spread or ball up even though it is still in a quasi-fluid state'
id.at col.1 ll.50-53
the parties equate setting the ink in the ¡¬823_patent and freezing the ink in the ¡¬518_patent

in order to ensure that deposited ink is not underexposed the uv sources will emit radiation over an area that is wider than the printheads
id.at col.5 ll.20-34
as a result some regions of ink will be exposed to radiation twice
id
if the various different colors of inkjet printheads are configured in a desirable way some overlap regions will be exposed to the uv_radiation five times
id.at col.5 ll.35-46
while it may appear that these regions will receive an excessive amount of energy if the carriage is operating as the slowest_speed the ¡¬823_patent_clarifies that effect of multiple_passes is not linearly additive.2 id.at col.5 ll.47-57
as the ¡¬823_patent shows in figures_7a & 7b reproduced below when ink is exposed to the uv_radiation five separate times at the slowest_carriage_speed the radiant_energy only penetrates the ink to a depth d3.3 id.at fig._7 b col.5 ll.58-67
while this depth d3 is more than the depth required to set the ink d2 it is still less than the depth required to cure the ink d1
id
; see id.at fig._7 a
to fully cure the ink the radiant_energy must penetrate the ink with depth` t' to the substrate 32
id.at col.5 ll.58-63

?
figures 7a & 7b
vutek asserts that this disclosure in the ¡¬823_patent anticipates the disputed *1354 portion of claim 1-a cold_uv curing assembly that is` oriented to direct_uv_energy.. to freeze dots of the jetted_ink' and` effective to impinge sufficient_uv_light on the ink to substantially cure the ink'
¡¬518_patent col.9 ll.17-22
the parties agree that the uv_radiation_source disclosed by the ¡¬823_patent consists of leds that leds are` cold_uv' and that these leds are` oriented to direct_uv_energy.. to freeze dots of the jetted_ink'
l & p however asserts that this disclosure fails to teach that the leds are` effective to impinge sufficient_uv_light on the ink to substantially cure the ink'

as noted above the district_court construed the term` substantially cure' to mean` cured to a great_extent or almost completely cured
`` 4 markman_order at *12
thus the relevant portion of claim 1 simply requires a cold_uv source e.g. leds that is` effective to impinge sufficient_uv_light on the ink' to cure the ink to a great_extent or almost completely cure it
moreover because the claim is written with functional rather than structural language-it requires the cold_uv_assembly to be` effective to' substantially cure rather than requiring ink to be substantially cured-the claim_limitation will be anticipated so long as the leds disclosed in the ¡¬823_patent are able to cure the ink to a great_extent
see in re schreiber 128_f.3d_1473 1478 fed.cir.1997 explaining a risk of functional claiming is that the functional limitation may be an inherent characteristic of the prior_art
against this backdrop we turn to our analysis

figure_7b shows that the leds will cure the ink 75-80 % as indicated by line d3 when the printer_carriage is operating at the slowest_speed and passes over the ink five times
¡¬823_patent fig._7 b col.5 ll.64-67 ; see j.a
2192 testimony from l & ps expert that dbig_token__3_represents_75__big_token -80 % cured
a reasonable mind might well find 75-80 % cured to be` substantially cured' and thus would conclude that the disclosed leds are effective to cure the ink to a great_extent
to grant summary_judgment however we must conclude` that even if all material_factual inferences are drawn in favor of the nonmovant there is no reasonable basis on which the non-movant can prevail'
scripps clinic & research found
v. genentech inc. 927_f.2d_1565 1576 fed.cir.1991
under this strict standard we can not say that as a matter of law 75-80 % cured is` cured to a great_extent or almost completely cured'

we can however conclude as a matter of law that the ¡¬823_patent inherently discloses leds that are` effective to impinge sufficient_uv_light on the ink to' cure the ink to a great_extent
`` under the principles of inherency if the prior_art necessarily functions in accordance with or includes the claims limitations it anticipates'
perricone v. medicis pharm corp. 432_f.3d_1368 1376 fed.cir.2005 quoting in re cruciferous sprout litig. 301_f.3d_1343 1349 fed.cir.2002
`` thus a prior_art reference may anticipate when the claim_limitation or limitations not expressly found in that reference are nonetheless inherent in it'
mehl/biophile int l_corp. v. milgraum 192_f.3d_1362 1365 fed.cir.1999
in other words the ¡¬ 823 patent will anticipate by inherency if its leds necessarily are` effective to impinge sufficient_uv_light on the ink to substantially cure the ink'

in figures_7a & 7b and the associated discussion the ¡¬823_patent teaches that if *1355 a uv_radiation_source is passed over the ink at a slower speed and/or multiple times the degree to which the ink is cured will increase
see ¡¬823_patent figs
7a-7b col.5 ll.58-67 comparing a full_cure d1 with one pass at high speed d2 with five passes at low speed d3
one of ordinary skill in the art reading this disclosure could only conclude that more passes and/or a slower carriage speed would result in an increasing degree of cure albeit not linearly increasing
as the district_court noted vuteks expert testified that multiple_passes would result in a substantial_cure and l & ps expert even acknowledged that there is some cumulative effect to multiple_passes
moreover the ¡¬823_patent later expressly discloses that` leds.. [ can be ] used to cure and/or set the ink'
id.at col.6 ll.25-30
thus while the ¡¬823_patent may not expressly disclose that the leds cure the ink to a great_extent it inherently discloses leds that are` effective to' do so
see in re schreiber 128 f.3d at 1478 concluding that prior_art inherently taught the patents requirement that the claimed device` allows several kernels of popped popcorn to pass through at the same time' while` permit [ ting ] the dispensing of only a few kernels' at a time

l & p fails to raise a disputed issue of material_fact with regard to whether the ¡¬823_patent anticipates
it argues for example that the ¡¬823_patent does not inherently disclose leds that are able to substantially cure the ink because leds were unable to do so at the time
in support l & p relies on its experts testimony that` leds were not capable of emitting sufficient radiation to cure'
we are not persuaded however by l & ps repeated efforts to conflate` substantially cure' and simply` cure'
the claim speaks of substantially curing not fully curing and vuteks expert asserts that the difference is significant
l & ps expert also asserts that the power output by a 290 nanometer` uv semiconductor optical device [ ]' was insufficient to cure the ink even two years after the ¡¬823_patent was filed
the disclosure of the ¡¬823_patent however is directed to multiple leds emitting at a 365 nanometer wavelength and it expressly states that this uv_radiation_source emits 50 watts per inch which is significantly more_energy than the 290-nanometer semiconductor optical device referenced by l & ps expert
¡¬823_patent col.5 ll.8-12 uv_radiation_sources emit 50 watts per inch id.at col.6 ll.4-16 uv_radiation_sources are 365-nanometer leds
finally l & p points to the testimony of vuteks expert who admitted leds were not` practical' for use in printers at the time because they were too expensive
the fact that a technology may be impractical does not undermine an otherwise anticipatory disclosure
celeritas techs. ltd. v. rockwell int l_corp. 150_f.3d_1354 1361 fed.cir.1998` the fact that a modem with a single carrier data signal is shown to be less than optimal does not vitiate the fact that it is disclosed`
moreover we have previously rejected` the contention that inherent anticipation requires recognition in the prior_art'
schering corp. v. geneva pharm. inc. 339_f.3d_1373 1377 fed.cir.2003
accordingly l & ps proffered evidence does not refute vuteks experts testimony that multiple_passes by the disclosed leds would eventually result in a substantial_cure
as a result l & p fails to create a question of fact sufficient to survive summary_judgment

l & ps other arguments are also unpersuasive
first l & p notes that the ¡¬823_patent_clarifies that` the energy the ink receives is sufficient to set the ink but not to cure it' which allegedly shows that the ¡¬ 823 patent does not teach leds effective to substantially cure the ink
¡¬ 823 patent col.6 ll.1-3 emphasis added
as we noted above however the difference *1356 between substantial_cure and full_cure is not insubstantial
l & p also argues that the reference does not anticipate because it repeatedly discusses using the leds to set and a downstream curing station to subsequently cure the ink
this argument relies on the erroneous assumption that the disclosure of multiple examples renders one example less anticipatory
see perricone 432 f.3d at 1376 rejecting the argument that one example` can not anticipate because it appears without special emphasis in a longer list' because a` disclosure is prior_art to the extent of its enabling disclosure'
l & p also argues that the ¡¬823_patent expressly teaches away from using leds to substantially cure the ink but` teaching away' is irrelevant to anticipation
celeritas techs. 150 f.3d at 1361` [ t ] he question whether a referenceteaches away from the invention is inapplicable to an anticipation_analysis`
finally l & p repeatedly compares the purpose of the ¡¬823_patent to the purpose of the ¡¬518_patent but we fail to see how this comparison proves that the latters claim is not anticipated by the formers disclosure

l & p also asserts that the district_court erred by allegedly concluding that the ¡¬823_patent inherently taught the disputed aspects because` the patent reveals the possibility which is all that is necessary'
see summary_judgment_order at 11
our law is clear-the fact that a claim_limitation may be present in a reference does not establish that the reference inherently discloses that limitation
mehl/biophile 192 f.3d at 1365
after reviewing the context of this statement however we understand that the district_court found that the reference disclosed the limitation as a` possibility' in the sense that an embodiment is one of the possibilities or examples disclosed by a patent
we conclude that this analysis in its entirety does not run afoul of our basic rule

accordingly we conclude that the district_court did not err in finding claims 1 9 10 and 19 of the ¡¬518_patent to be anticipated by vuteks ¡¬823_patent
while l & p also appeals the district_courts finding that dependent_claims 2 3 and 7 are rendered obvious by a combination of vuteks ¡¬823_patent and vuteks ¡¬355_patent l & ps only argument is that the obviousness finding is based on the allegedly erroneous anticipation finding
so because we perceive no error in the anticipation finding we conclude that the district_court did not err in finding claims 2 3 and 7 to be obvious in light of a combination of vuteks ¡¬823_patent and vuteks ¡¬355_patent

iii
for the above reasons we affirm the district_courts grant of summary_judgment that claims 1-3 7 9-10 and 19 of the ¡¬518_patent are either anticipated by the ¡¬823_patent or rendered obvious in light of the ¡¬823_patent and the ¡¬355_patent
because we affirm the district_courts original basis for granting vuteks motion for summary_judgment of invalidity-i.e. that claims 1-3 7 9-10 and 19 of the ¡¬518_patent are invalid for anticipation and obviousness-we need not address l & ps appeal of the courts alternative basis for granting this motion-i.e. that these claims are invalid for indefiniteness
accordingly we affirm the district_courts final_judgment and declaration that claims 1-3 7 9-10 and 19 of the ¡¬518_patent are invalid

in its brief vutek challenged the district_courts construction of the term` substantially cure'
at oral argument however vutek conceded that this issue is not properly before us because vutek does not contend that the anticipation_analysis depends upon the construction of this term
