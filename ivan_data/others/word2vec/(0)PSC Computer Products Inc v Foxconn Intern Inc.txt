gajarsa circuit_judge
psc_computer_products inc.` psc' appeals the final judgment of the united_states_district_court for the central_district of california granting foxconn international inc. and hon hai precision industry co. ltd. collectively` foxconn' summary_judgment of non-infringement of u.s. patent no._6061,239 the` ¡¬239_patent`
psc computer prods. inc. v. foxconn int l no._01- cv-6414
because psc dedicated plastic_clips to the public by explicitly claiming only clips made of metal while specifically disclosing that the prior_art included clips made of plastic we affirm

background
the united_states patent and trademark_office` pto' issued the ¡¬239_patent for a` cam-type retainer clip for heat sinks for electronic integrated circuits'
the ¡¬239_patent was assigned to psc
the ¡¬239_patent covers a small but significant component of a complex technology product-the microchip
like many electronic *1355 components an operating microchip generates heat
a microchip generates heat as electrons flow through the` logic_gates' that enable it to compute the desired outputs from its given inputs
an operating microchip generates heat proportional to the number of logic_gates on that chip
because modern chips generate enough heat to risk becoming self-destructive system designers need to include heat_sinks to dissipate the heat
this heat dissipation extends the useful life of both the microchip and adjacent heat sensitive components

the ¡¬239_patent describes an invention for securing a heat_sink to a chip using a cam-type_retainer_clip
claim 1 of the ¡¬239_patent claims in a heat_sink_assembly providing cooling to an electronic semiconductor device wherein the device is mounted in a module the module having means for engagement with a retainer_clip and the heat_sink having a generally flat bottom surface and heat conducting engagement with the semiconductor device upper_surface and a plurality of fins on the upper_surface defining at least one channel the improvement comprising a heat_sink retainer_clip including an elongated resilient_metal_strap received in one of the channels of the heat_sink having holding means at each end engaging the engagement means on the module the center_portion of the strap spaced a predetermined distance above the upper_surface of the heat_sink base when the strap is not in tension ; and
a cam-type latch pivotally mounted in the center_portion of the strap and including a cam with a bearing surface the distance from the pivot_access to the bearing surface of the cam being greater than the distance between the pivot_access and the upper_surface of the base of the heat_sink when said strap is not in tension and an arm fixedly mounted to said cam said arm when rotated causing said bearing surface of said cam to be forced against the surface of the base of the heat_sink placing the strap in tension so as to force the heat_sink into heat conducting engagement with the module
'239_patent col._6,_ll._6-31 emphasis added

the strap and the latch are the only two parts of a cam-type_retainer_clip for a heat_sink_assembly as implied by claim 1
one way that vendors can differentiate their products is by manufacturing these clip parts out of different materials
the choice of materials for the retainer_clip lies at the heart of this dispute
psc and foxconn sell competing cam-type_retainer_clips for heat_sink assemblies
pscs clip is made of metal while foxconns clip is made of plastic
psc filed suit in the united_states_district_court for the central_district of california alleging that foxconns clip infringed the ¡¬ 239 patent
psc conceded that foxconns clip did not literally infringe the ¡¬239_patent because claim 1 covers clips containing` an elongated resilient_metal_strap' and foxconns clip was made of plastic but maintained nonetheless that foxconns plastic_clip infringes the ¡¬239_patent under the doctrine of equivalents
foxconn in turn argued that psc had dedicated clips with plastic_parts to the public and moved for summary_judgment of non-infringement on that ground

the district_court reviewed the ¡¬239_patents claims and written description and agreed with foxconn that psc had dedicated plastic_clips to the public
in granting summary_judgment to foxconn the district_court relied on our recent decision in johnson & johnston associates v. r.e
service co. 285_f.3d_1046_(fed.cir.2002) en banc where we held that a patent_applicant who discloses but does not *1356 claim subject_matter has dedicated that matter to the public and can not reclaim the disclosed matter under the doctrine of equivalents
id
we had previously outlined this rule in maxwell v. j. baker inc. 86_f.3d_1098_(fed.cir.1996) where we similarly held that a patent that disclosed subject_matter in its written description without claiming it dedicated that subject_matter to the public and that use of the dedicated_matter did not infringe the patent
the district_court here determined that because the written description of the ¡¬239_patent disclosed clips made of plastic_parts without claiming plastic it had dedicated plastic_clips to the public
foxconn therefore could not infringe the ¡¬239_patent by equivalents because its plastic_clips used materials in the public_domain

in reaching that conclusion the district_court noted the specific language in the written description stating that` [ t ] he elongated strap [ ] is made of a resilient metal such as stainless_steel although other_resilient_materials may be suitable for the strap' ¡¬239_patent col._4,_ll._49-51 emphasis added and that` [ o ] ther_prior_art_devices use molded plastic and/or metal_parts that must be cast or forged which again are more expensive_metal forming operations'
id. col. 2. ll
39-41 emphasis added

according to the district_court these passages demonstrate that at the time that the inventor applied for the ¡¬239_patent he knew that other materials including plastic could be used to make` parts' of his invention and that the inventor asserted the metal design of the ¡¬239_patent as an improvement over the prior_art
the ¡¬239_patent however does not claim plastic_parts but instead includes an explicit` metal' limitation
the district_court applied johnson to conclude that the disclosure of unclaimed materials in the ¡¬ 239 patents written description dedicated those materials to the public
this dedication prevented psc from using the doctrine of equivalents to extend the scope of its patent claims to include plastic

the district_court found further support for this conclusion in scimed life systems v. advanced cardiovascular systems 242_f.3d_1337_(fed.cir.2001) where we explained that where the specification makes clear that the invention does not include a particular feature that feature is deemed to be outside the reach of the claims of the patent even though the language of the claims read without reference to the specification might be considered broad enough to encompass the feature in question
id.at 1341
having specifically identified criticized and disclaimed [ a specific ] configuration the patentee can not now invoke the doctrine of equivalents to` embrace a structure that was specifically excluded from the claims'
id.at 1345 citation omitted

based upon these precedents the district_court determined that psc had disclosed and dedicated the use of non-metallic resilient materials specifically including plastic and could not now invoke the doctrine of equivalents to embrace specifically disclosed materials that had not been claimed
the district_court granted foxconn summary_judgment of non-infringement
psc timely appealed
we have jurisdiction of this appeal pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

discussion

standard of review
this court reviews the grant of summary_judgment de novo

summary judgment is appropriate when there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law

a determination of patent infringement requires a two-step analysis
the court must first interpret the claims to determine their scope and meaning
cybor corp. v. fas techs inc. 138_f.3d_1448 1454 fed.cir.1998 en banc
it must then compare the properly construed claims to the allegedly infringing device
id
the first step claim_construction is a matter of law that we review de novo
id.at 1451
the second step is a factual question that we review following a trial for clear error
bai v. l & l wings inc. 160_f.3d_1350 1353 fed.cir.1998
when conducting a de novo review of a district_courts grant of summary_judgment however we construe the facts in the light most favorable to the non-movant
mazzari v. rogan 323_f.3d_1000 1005 fed.cir.2003
to prove infringement the patentee must show that the accused device meets each claim limitation either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents
deering precision instruments l.l.c
v. vector distrib
sys. 347_f.3d_1314 1324 fed.cir.2003

b
the disclosure-dedication rule
although an infringement analysis typically begins with claim_construction cybor 138 f.3d at 1454 the district_court here did not construe the claims of the ¡¬239_patent because their meaning is not disputed
the district_court turned immediately to the factual comparison of the ¡¬239_patents claim_language to foxconns plastic_clip see bai 160 f.3d at 1353 to determine infringement
we do likewise

psc who bears the burden of proving infringement either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents see deering 347 f.3d at 1324 concedes that foxconns clip does not literally infringe the ¡¬239_patent
the entire infringement analysis turns on whether psc can claim plastic_clips under the doctrine of equivalents despite having disclosed in its written description that plastic_parts were used in the prior_art and having failed to include plastic in its claims
a patentee may not write narrow claims for allowance by the pto and subsequently attempt to broaden the claims in court by using the doctrine of equivalents
autogiro co. of am
v. united_states 181_ct.cl._55 60 384_f.2d_391_(1967)` courts can neither broaden nor narrow the claims to give the patentee something different than what he has set forth
``

the issue to be resolved by this court is the scope of our ruling in johnson
psc argues that this case differs from johnson in that the johnson_disclosure was clear and specific while the psc disclosure is not
in johnson u.s. patent no._5153,050 the` ¡¬050_patent` related to the manufacture of printed circuit boards
though the ¡¬050_patents claim_language specifically claimed a sheet of aluminum its written description explained that` [ w ] hile aluminum is currently the preferred material.. other metals such as stainless_steel or nickel alloys may be used'
johnson 285 f.3d at 1050 citing ¡¬050_patent
the accused infringing product was made of stainless_steel
id
we held that the ¡¬050_patent dedicated the alternative material stainless_steel to the public and that the defendants stainless_steel product could therefore not infringe the ¡¬050_patent as a matter of law
id

similarly in maxwell u.s. patent no._4624,060 the` ¡¬060_patent` claimed a system for attaching mated shoes together for *1358 display in a retail environment
the ¡¬060_patent disclosed in the written description but did not claim that` the tabs may be stitched into a lining_seam of the shoes at the sides or back of the shoes' maxwell 86 f.3d at 1106 citing ¡¬ 060 patent
the accused product stitched the tabs into a lining_seam of the shoes
id
we held that the ¡¬060_patent had dedicated the alternative method of keeping mated shoes together by stitching tabs into a lining_seam of the shoes at the sides or back of the shoes to the public and that the defendants product employing that alternative could therefore not infringe the ¡¬060_patent as a matter of law
id

according to psc the johnson written description clearly dedicated_matter to the public because of the precision and clarity of its disclosure
here psc argues that the disclosure of plastic in the written description of the ¡¬ 239 patent was neither precise nor clear and should not constitute a dedication to the public

we must answer two questions 1 how specific must a disclosure in a written description be to dedicate matter to the public ?
and 2 was the ¡¬239 written description sufficiently specific to dedicate plastic_parts to the public ?

psc is correct in noting that johnson like maxwell involved a clear precise disclosure
anyone reading the patents would have recognized both the johnson_disclosure of stainless_steel and the maxwell disclosure of tabs stitched into a lining_seam of the shoes as explicit alternatives to the inventions claimed in the ¡¬050 and ¡¬060_patent s respectively
psc argues that only language as clear as the johnson or the maxwell disclosures is sufficient to dedicate matter to the public and that because the ¡¬239_patents disclosure of prior_art made of plastic is oblique and incidental plastic_clip_parts were never dedicated to the public

we disagree
pscs disclosure that the prior_art included clips with plastic_parts was both precise and clear
one important purpose of the written description is to provide notice to the public as to the subject_matter of the patent while the claim provides notice as to the scope of the invention
the ¡¬239_patents claim_language placed the public on notice that metal_clip_parts would infringe
its written description served notice that plastic had been used as an alternative to metal in the prior_art and that the future use of plastic would therefore not infringe

to appreciate the two aspects of this notice function it is important to recall that claims and written descriptions are both integral parts of a patent under 35 u.s.c.¡± 112
the supreme_court long ago explained that accurate description of the invention is required by law for several important purposes 1
that the government may know what is granted and what will become public_property when the term of the monopoly expires
2
that licensed persons desiring to practice the invention may know during the term how to make construct and use the invention
3
that other inventors may know what part of the field of invention is unoccupied
bates v. coe 98_u.s._31 39 25_l.ed._68_(1878)
these fundamental precepts of patent_law have remained unchanged for more than a century and a quarter ; we reiterated them in johnson 285 f.3d at 1052` both the supreme_court and this court have adhered to the fundamental principle that claims define the scope of patent protection..
the claims give notice both to the examiner at the u.s. patent and trademark_office during prosecution and to the public at large including potential competitors after the patent has issued'
( citations omitted

*1359 the relationship between a patents claim and its written description has also long been understood while the claims of a patent limit the invention and specifications can not be utilized to expand the patent monopoly burns v. meyer 100_u.s._671 672 25_l.ed._733_(1879) ; mccarty v. lehigh valley r. co. 160_u.s._110 116 16_s.ct._240 40_l.ed._358_(1895) it is fundamental that claims are to be construed in the light of the specifications and both are to be read with a view to ascertaining the invention seymour v. osborne 11_wall._516 547 20_l.ed._33_(1871) ; schriber-schroth co. v. cleveland trust co. 311_u.s._211 61_s.ct._235 85_l.ed._132_(1940) ; schering corp. v. gilbert 153_f.2d_428_(1946)
united_states v. adams 383_u.s._39 48-49 86_s.ct._708 15_l.ed.2d_572_(1966)

by thus limiting the invention id. claims serve the important notice function of informing the public that anyone who makes uses or sells the claimed invention infringes the patent
35 u.s.c.¡± 271 a
our predecessor court captured this point in a nutshell` the use of the specification as a concordance for the claims is accepted by almost every court and is a basic concept of patent_law'
autogiro 181 ct.cl.at 63 384_f.2d_391

in essence the written description can at times assist the public in understanding the notice given in the claims by explaining which portions of the relevant art the patent does not cover
scimed 242 f.3d at 1341
to quote an oft-repeated phrase` specifications teach
claims claim'
sri int l v. matsushita elec corp. 775_f.2d_1107 1121_n._14_(fed.cir.1985)
`` consistent with its scope definition and notice functions the claim requirement presupposes that a patent_applicant defines his invention in the claims not in the specification
after all the claims not the specification provide the measure of the patentees right to exclude'
johnson 285 f.3d at 1052

suitable notice to the public however requires that the public understand the language of both the claims and the written description
we have repeatedly explained that in the absence of a compelling_reason to do otherwise claims must be interpreted as one of ordinary_skill in the art would understand them
see e.g. apex inc. v. raritan computer inc. 325_f.3d_1364 1371 fed.cir.2003` in analyzing the intrinsic evidence we start with the language of the claims and engage in astrong presumption that claim_terms carry their ordinary meaning as viewed by one of ordinary_skill in the art
`` ; bj servs co. v. halliburton energy servs. 338_f.3d_1368 1372 fed.cir.2003` the question becomes whether one of ordinary_skill in the art would understand what is claimed when the claim is read in light of the specification
`` ; dow chem co. v. sumitomo chem co. 257_f.3d_1364 1372 fed.cir.2001` as a starting point we give claim_terms their ordinary and accustomed meaning as understood by one of ordinary_skill in the art`
it thus follows as a matter of simple logic that in the absence of a compelling_reason to do otherwise the written description must also be interpreted according to the understanding of one of ordinary_skill in the art

taken together then one of ordinary_skill in the art should be able to read a patent to discern which matter is disclosed and discussed in the written description and to recognize which matter has been claimed
`` the presumption is and such is generally the fact that what is not claimed was not invented by the patentee but was known and used before he made his invention
but whether so or not his own act has made it public_property if it was not so before'
*1360 mahn v. harwood 112_u.s._354 112_u.s._354 361 28_l.ed._665_(1884)
the ability to discern both what has been disclosed and what has been claimed is the essence of public notice
it tells the public which products or processes would infringe the patent and which would not
were the patentee allowed to reclaim some specifically-disclosed-but-unclaimed_matter under the doctrine of equivalents the public would have no way of knowing which disclosed matter infringed and which did not
see festo corp. v. shoketsu kinzoku kogyo kabushiki co. 344_f.3d_1359 1369-70 fed.cir.2003 en banc
such a reclamation would eviscerate the public notice function of patents and create uncertainty in the law
id

we thus hold that if one of ordinary_skill in the art can understand the unclaimed disclosed teaching upon reading the written description the alternative matter disclosed has been dedicated to the public
this` disclosure-dedication' rule does not mean that any generic reference in a written specification necessarily dedicates all members of that particular genus to the public
the disclosure must be of such specificity that one of ordinary_skill in the art could identify the subject_matter that had been disclosed and not claimed

c. disclosure-dedication in the ¡¬239_patent
the passages that the district_court identified in the ¡¬239 written description illustrate both generic and specific disclosures
we agree with psc that the generic disclosure that` other_resilient_materials may be suitable for the strap' ¡¬239_patent col._4,_ll._50-51 did not dedicate all resilient materials other than stainless_steel to the public
we agree with the district_court however that the specific disclosure that` [ o ] ther_prior_art_devices use molded plastic and/or metal_parts that must be cast or forged which again are more expensive_metal forming operations' id. col. 2. ll
39-41 dedicated the alternative use of plastic_parts to the public
a reader of ordinary_skill in the art could reasonably conclude from this language in the written description that plastic_clip_parts could be substituted for metal_clip_parts
psc was thus obliged either to claim plastic_parts in addition to metal_parts and to submit this broader_claim for examination or to not claim them and dedicate the use of plastic_parts to the public
the ¡¬239_patents claims and written description thus combined to put the public on notice that clips made of metal_parts would infringe while those made of plastic_parts would not
the district_court in essence concluded that that one of ordinary_skill in the art would be compelled to read the written description to establish that plastic_parts may serve as an alternative to the metal_parts in the claim

the disclosure-dedication_rule requires an inventor who discloses specific matter to claim it and to submit the broader_claim for examination
otherwise that matter is dedicated to the public and may not be recaptured under the doctrine of equivalents
the use of plastic_parts in the manufacture of cam-type_retainer_clips for heat_sinks was therefore dedicated to the public and foxconns plastic_clips could not infringe as a matter of law

d. pscs equitable and public policy concerns
psc raises a number of important issues of equity and of public policy concerning the disclosure-dedication_rule
psc contends that the` metal' limitation of the ¡¬239_patent was inadvertent and that it is thus unfair to dedicate plastic to the public
the supreme_court recently noted that` [ t ] he patentee as the author of the claim_language may be expected to draft claims encompassing readily known equivalents' festo corp. v. shoketsu kinzoku *1361 kogyo kabushiki co. 535_u.s._722 741 122_s.ct._1831 152_l.ed.2d_944_(2002)
this expectation follows as a matter of course from the supreme_courts much earlier observation` every day that passes after the issue of the patent adds to the strength of [ the publics right to use unclaimed_matter ] and increases the barrier against subsequent expansion of the claim by reissue under a pretense of inadvertence and mistake'
mahn 112 u.s. at 361 5_s.ct._174
the patentee rather than the public must bear the burden of inadvertent errors in the patent-including inadvertent dedications.1

as a matter of policy psc argues that a disclosure-dedication_rule broad enough to encompass its own disclosure of plastic will motivate future patentees to draft sparse written descriptions to ensure that they are not inadvertently dedicating anything to the public
we disagree
we expect the disclosure-dedication_rule to motivate patentees to draw the broadest claims that they consider to be patentable and to submit these broad claims to the pto for examination
the disclosure-dedication_rule as specified today should thereby serve the important public notice function of patents-the mechanism whereby the public learns which innovations are the subjects of the claimed invention and which are in the public_domain
johnson 285 f.3d at 1052
the disclosure-dedication_rule is thus both equitable and in the public interest

conclusion
because the district_court correctly concluded that the ¡¬239_patent disclosed the use of plastic_parts but did not claim it we affirm its summary_judgment of non-infringement

affirmed
