continental can company usa and continental pet technologies collectively` continental' appeal the partial_summary_judgment of the united_states_district_court for the southern_district of ohio holding that united_states patent no._4108,324 the conobase or324_patent is invalid.1 final judgment was entered on this issue for the purpose of appeal

summary judgment
an issue may be decided on motion for summary_judgment when there is no genuine_issue of material_fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law

the movants burden is to show that no fact material to the issue is in dispute that even if all material_factual inferences are drawn in favor of the non-movant the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law

summary judgment is as available in patent cases as in other areas of litigation

while facilitating the disposition of legally meritless suits when summary_judgment *1266 is improvidently granted the effect is to prolong litigation and increase its burdens
this is of particular concern in patent disputes where the patent property is a wasting asset and justice is ill served by delay in final resolution
in the case at bar although some issues could be resolved on the law and undisputed facts other_issues require trial

the patented invention
the324_patent entitled` ribbed bottom structure for plastic container' inventors suppayan m. krishnakumar siegfried s. roy john f.e
pocock salil k. das and gautam k. mahajan is directed to a plastic_bottle whose bottom_structure has sufficient flexibility to impart improved impact_resistance combined with sufficient rigidity to resist deformation under internal pressure
the patented bottle is said to provide a superior combination of these properties
the bottom_structure is illustrated as follows

?
-- -- - claim 1 is the broadest claim of the324_patent 1
a container having a sidewall and a bottom_structure closing the container at an end portion of the sidewall the outer_surface of the bottom_structure comprising a central_concavity a convex heel surrounding the concavity and merging therewith and with the sidewall end portion the lowermost points of the heel lying in a common plane and a plurality of ribs interrupting the outer_surface of the concavity and distributed in a symmetrical array each rib extending longitudinally in the direction of the heel and downwardly from an inner portion of the concavity whereby the outer end portion of each rib is lower than the inner end portion thereof characterized by the feature that the ribs are hollow
claims 2_through_5 include additional limitations described as contributing to the structures rigidity flexibility or both
claim 2 specifies the ratios of thickness of the walls of the bottom_structure to the thickness of the sidewall end portions
claim 3 specifies that the margins of each rib merge smoothly with adjacent portions of the bottom_structure
claim 4 specifies that each rib is convex relative to the bottom_structure
claim 5 specifies that each rib is of fusiform a gently tapered shape at the ends configuration
each claim carries an independent presumption of validity *1267 35 u.s.c.¡± 282 and stands or falls independent of the other claims
altoona publix theatres inc. v. american tri-ergon corp. 294_u.s._477 487 55_s.ct._455 459 79_l.ed._1005_(1935)

continental brought suit for patent infringement against monsanto company and monsantos successor in this business hoover_universal inc. and hoovers parent company johnson_controls collectively` monsanto'
monsanto moved for partial_summary_judgment based on issues of validity under 35 u.s.c.¡±¡± 102_and_103

i
35 u.s.c.¡± 102 a the statutory requirement that a patented invention be` new' is tested in accordance with 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 a which provides that ¡± 102
a person shall be entitled to a patent unless- a the invention was known or used by others in this country or patented or described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country before the invention thereof by the applicant for patent..
the district_court found that all the claims of the324_patent were anticipated by u.s._patent_no._3468,443 the marcus_patent
we conclude that the district_court erred in claim interpretation and also found disputed facts adversely to the nonmovant thus inappropriately deciding the issue summarily

anticipation under ¡± 102 a requires that the identical invention that is claimed was previously known to others and thus is not new
scripps_clinic 927 f.2d at 1576 18 u.s.p.q.2d at 1010 ; titanium metals corp. of am
v. banner 778_f.2d_775 780 227_u.s.p.q._773 777-78 fed.cir.1985 ; lindemann maschinenfabrik gmbh v. american hoist and derrick co. 730_f.2d_1452 1458 221_u.s.p.q._481 485 fed.cir.1984
when more than one reference is required to establish unpatentability of the claimed invention anticipation under ¡± 102 can not be found and validity is determined in terms of ¡± 103

it was monsantos burden to show that every element of the several claims of the324_patent was identically described in the asserted anticipating reference the marcus_patent
the district_court focused on the term` characterized by the feature that the ribs are hollow' which limits all of the324_patent claims
continental argues that the district_court incorrectly construed this term as a matter of law and that the marcus_patent shows ribs that are not hollow as that term is used in the324_patent
continental also points to other differences between the324 claims and the description in the marcus_patent

the marcus_patent rib structure is illustrated in figure 5 and in cross-section in figure 6

?
-- -- - *1268 the marcus_patent does not state that its ribs are` hollow' or use a similar term
continentals witnesses testified by deposition that the marcus_patent shows solid not hollow ribs
a witness adomaitis had stated in an internal memorandum written at continental in 1969 well before this litigation arose that` the ribs of their [ marcus ] web can be made of solid beams only'
another witness324 co-inventor pocock testified that it seems evident to me that he [ marcus ] was trying to produce some kind of container integrity by the production of essentially solid_ribs on the bottom of the bottle
it seems to go to great length here to illustrate them as such
krishnakumar another co-inventor testified that it` is very obvious the ribs are shown solid' and that figures 5_and_6 as well as figures 7_through_12 of the marcus_patent all show solid_ribs
however marcus testifying for monsanto testified that his ribs were hollow and that conventional blow molding would inherently produce hollow_ribs

the district_court defined` hollow' as meaning that` the inside contour of the ribs generally follows the outside contour thereof' a definition on which the parties agreed
continental 11 u.s.p.q.2d at 1764
see the courts opinion 11 u.s.p.q.2d at 1764-68 for various sketches made by the witnesses
continental states that the district_court erred in construing` hollow' and that the phrase` characterized by the feature that the ribs are hollow' must be construed in terms of the patent in which it appears
see e.g. tandon corp. v. united_states int l trade comm n 831_f.2d_1017 1021 4_u.s.p.q.2d_1283 1286 fed.cir.1987
the324_patent explicitly distinguished the marcus_patent teachings stating that the324 ribs are unlike marcus not filled with plastic
the324 specification uses the term` hollow' as do the prosecution_history and the claims for this purpose
the324_patents usage of` hollow' is illustrated in the rib cross-section in figure 5a

?
-- -- - the marcus_patents rib structure thus was explicitly differentiated by the term` hollow' as used in the324 specification drawings and prosecution_history
since the claim_term must be construed as used by the patentee the district_court erred in its construction of the324 claim_term` hollow'
on correct claim construction the factual question of anticipation must be decided

monsantos argument is that hollow_ribs were inherently produced by marcus
monsanto thus argues that anticipation lies because the marcus_patents ribs are` inherently' hollow regardless of how they are shown in the marcus_patent
monsanto argues that because the marcus_ribs are formed by injection blow molding which is the same process described for the conobase324 ribs hollow_ribs are inherently disclosed in the marcus_patent

to serve as an anticipation when the reference is silent about the asserted inherent characteristic such gap in the reference may be filled with recourse to extrinsic evidence
such evidence must make clear that the missing descriptive matter is necessarily present in the thing described in the reference and that it would be so recognized by persons of ordinary_skill
in re oelrich 666_f.2d_578 581 212_u.s.p.q._323 326 ccpa 1981 quoting hansgirg v. kemmer 102_f.2d_212 214 40_u.s.p.q._665 667 ccpa 1939 provides *1269 inherency however may not be established by probabilities or possibilities
the mere fact that a certain thing may result from a given set of circumstances is not sufficient
[ citations omitted ]
if however the disclosure is sufficient to show that the natural result flowing from the operation as taught would result in the performance of the questioned function it seems to be well settled that the disclosure should be regarded as sufficient
this modest flexibility in the rule that` anticipation' requires that every element of the claims appear in a single reference accommodates situations where the common knowledge of technologists is not recorded in the reference ; that is where technological facts are known to those in the field of the invention albeit not known to judges
it is not however a substitute for determination of patentability in terms of ¡± 103

continental does not dispute the applicability of the injection blow molding process
however continental disputes the material_fact of whether this process necessarily produced` hollow' ribs in the marcus base structure as the term` hollow' is used in the324_patent
resolution of this disputed fact adversely to continental was improper on summary_judgment
the grant of summary_judgment of anticipation under ¡± 102 a is vacated
the issue requires trial

ii
35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b the district_court also held that the marcus_bottle was on sale 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b
section 102 b bars entitlement to a patent when b the invention was.. in public use or on sale in this country more than one year prior to the date of the application for patent in the united_states..
the marcus_bottle was developed some ten years before the filing date of the324_patent during a project wherein marcus employer admiral_plastics or apl corporation entered into agreements with the coca-cola company for the development of a suitable plastic_bottle
the agreements provided that admiral_plastics would make and coca-cola would test the bottles and that if a satisfactory_bottle was developed it would be manufactured by admiral and purchased by coca-cola
minimum commercial quantities and maximum commercial prices were stated in an agreement and costs were a matter of discussion
admiral produced a variety of bottle shapes including the marcus_bottle
the project was terminated after about two years because the` mechanical performance' requirements were not met as coca-cola wrote at the time

the district_court reasoned that this project` called for the eventual marketing of the marcus_bottles once all technical_difficulties were resolved' continental 11 u.s.p.q.2d at 1766 and on this basis held that the marcus_bottles were on sale
this holding was in error for the` on sale' bar of ¡± 102 b does not arise simply because the intended customer was participating in development and testing
see great northern corp. v. davis core & pad co. 782_f.2d_159 164-65 228_u.s.p.q._356 358 fed.cir.1986
in baker oil tools inc. v. geo vann inc. 828_f.2d_1558 1563-65 4_u.s.p.q.2d_1210 1213-15 fed.cir.1987 this court summarized various factors pertinent to the` on sale' bar when there is an issue concerning the relationship between the patentee and the customer for example whether there was a need for testing by other than the patentee ; the amount of control exercised ; the stage of development of the invention ; whether payments were made and the basis thereof ; whether confidentiality was required ; and whether technological changes were made
all of the circumstances attending the relationship must be considered in light of the public policy underlying ¡± 102 b

denied 484_u.s._1025 108_s.ct._748 98_l.ed.2d_761_(1988)

the district_court acknowledged that all technical_difficulties were not resolved and that no sales were ever made
*1270 although admiral_plastics hope was surely commercial sales and the record shows that prices and quantities were discussed this does not of itself place the subject_matter` on sale' in the sense of ¡± 102 b
the marcus_bottle was part of a terminated development project that never bore commercial fruit and was cloaked in confidentiality
while the line is not always bright between development and being on sale see generally umc electronics supra in this case the line was not crossed
the` on sale' bar is measured by` the time the public came into possession of the invention' id.at 655 2 u.s.p.q.2d at 1471 quoting in re foster 343_f.2d_980 987-88 145_u.s.p.q._166 173 ccpa 1965 cert
denied 383_u.s._966 86_s.ct._1270 16_l.ed.2d_307_(1966)` what starts the period running is clearly the availability of the invention to the public through the categories of disclosure enumerated in 102 b..' emphasis in original
we conclude that the district_court erred in holding that the circumstances that here existed placed the marcus_bottles` on sale' in terms of ¡± 102 b
we therefore reverse and direct that on remand judgment on this issue shall be entered in favor of continental as a matter of law

iii
35 u.s.c.¡± 103
obviousness 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 is reviewed as a legal conclusion based upon underlying facts of four general categories viz
the scope and content of the prior_art the differences between the prior_art and the claimed invention the level of ordinary_skill at the time the invention was made and any objective considerations that may be present
graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 17 86_s.ct._684 693-94 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966) ; interconnect planning corp. v. feil 774_f.2d_1132 1137-38 227_u.s.p.q._543 547 fed.cir.1985

the parties agreed that the scope and content of the prior_art was adequately represented by four references the marcus_patent discussed in part i ante a patent to colombo u.s._patent_no._3403,804 and two patents owned by continental u.s._patent_no._3598,270 the petaloid_patent and no._3935,955 the decaloid patent
they agreed on little else
in granting summary_judgment of invalidity for obviousness the district_court found certain disputed material_facts and misapplied certain precepts of law
we conclude that the issue was not amenable to summary resolution
although it is not entirely clear how the references were combined by the court we shall review the references briefly in order to explain our conclusion

the petaloid patent
the district_court referred to the deposition_testimony of siegfried roy one of the co-inventors of the324_patent that the petaloid_base inverted was similar to the conobase
continental points out that neither roy nor any other deponent suggested that the petaloid_base could be or should be inverted or that inversion would provide an improved base structure
in in re gordon 733_f.2d_900 902 221_u.s.p.q._1125 1127 fed.cir.1984 this court held that although a prior_art device could have been turned upside down that did not make the modification obvious unless the prior_art fairly suggested the desirability of turning the device upside down

continental points out that the petaloid description differs in several other ways from the324 invention
in the324 structure the outer end of each rib is lower than the inner end whereas in the petaloid structure the outer ends of the ribs are higher than the inner ends ; that is the ribs in the petaloid_base extend upward from the center to the sidewall
the petaloid bottle is supported on feet extending between the ribs such feet being the locations for stress_concentrations
the following drawing is from the petaloid_patent

*1271. ?
-- -- - continental states that the324 conobase is not only different but avoids the stress_concentrations of the petaloid device thus enhancing impact_resistance
monsanto argues that continental simply used the petaloid hollow_ribs in combination with the marcus_patent
this requires determination of whether there was something in the prior_art as a whole to suggest the desirability and thus the obviousness of making the combination in a way that would produce the324 structure
see e.g. uniroyal inc. v. rudkin-wiley corp. 837_f.2d_1044 1051 5_u.s.p.q.2d_1434 1438 fed.cir
) cert
denied 488_u.s._825 109_s.ct._75 102_l.ed.2d_51_(1988)
continental argues that it is not apparent even with hindsight how any combination of the petaloid and marcus_patents or other references lead to the324 base
the petaloid_patent shows concave ribs that extend all the way to the sidewall while the marcus_ribs extend` from the heel' toward an annular central ring
the petaloid_base has wide petal-like open ribs while marcus shows narrow beam-like ribs
the deposition_testimony was in conflict as to the inferences drawn from the references

on this disputed issue drawing reasonable inferences in favor of the non-movant it has not been established that one skilled in the art would be motivated to select and combine features from each source in order to make the324 base
interconnect planning 774 f.2d at 1143 227 u.s.p.q.at 551` when prior_art_references require selective_combination by the court to render obvious a subsequent invention there must be some reason for the combination other than the hindsight gleaned from the invention itself'

the decaloid patent
the district_court also referred to combination of the decaloid_base with the marcus base
the decaloid_base has ten hollow_ribs that extend to the sidewall and ten feet between the ribs

*1272. ?
-- -- - monsanto does not explain and we can not discern how the combination with marcus would have led a person of ordinary_skill to the324 base
the courts summary holding of obviousness based on these references separately or in combination can not be sustained

the colombo patent
the colombo base like the petaloid and decaloid_bases has hollow_ribs that extend to the sidewall in a still different structure from that of marcus and also from that of the324_patent
colombo describes his ribs as inverted u-shapes concave located on the outer_surface of the central_concavity

?
-- -- - again drawing reasonable factual inferences in favor of continental and in the absence of any suggestion or motivation in the prior_art as a whole to make a selective_combination of the colombo and marcus *1273 structures along with other changes needed to obtain the324 structure summary_judgment of obviousness was inappropriate

the district_court found that there was no substantial_difference between the324 invention and the combined teachings of the prior_art as obviousness can be established on the basis of the combined teachings of references we think it is clear that simple_enhancements of existing prior_art i.e
inverting the270 petaloid base do not constitute a substantial_difference between the subject_matter claimed in the324_patent and that of the prior_art
thus the facts of this case reveal no substantial_difference between324 and the prior_art
continental 11 u.s.p.q.2d at 1769 citation omitted
however as we have discussed the criterion of ¡± 103 is not whether the differences from the prior_art are` simple_enhancements' but whether it would have been obvious to make the claimed structure

objective indicia
the district_court concluded that the structure in suit is simply a variation on known themes
it is in such circumstance that the objective_indicia-the so-called secondary_considerations-are most useful to the decision-maker
the significance of a new_structure is often better measured in the marketplace than in the courtroom

thus when differences that may appear technologically minor nonetheless have a practical impact particularly in a crowded field the decision-maker must consider the obviousness of the new_structure in this light
such objective_indicia as commercial_success or filling an existing need illuminate the technological and commercial environment of the inventor and aid in understanding the state of the art at the time the invention was made
see in re piasecki 745_f.2d_1468 1475 223_u.s.p.q._785 790 fed.cir.1984 secondary_considerations` often establish that an invention appearing to have been obvious in light of the prior_art was not' quoting stratoflex inc. v. aeroquip corp. 713_f.2d_1530 1538-39 218_u.s.p.q._871 879 fed.cir.1983

continental licensed the324 counterpart japanese patent to a japanese company yoshino that we are told had been unable to develop a plastic_bottle for hot-fill_applications
a witness for toyo seikan another japanese licensee testified that the conobase` sustains itself in higher temperatures and it does not cause buckling after you fill [ the bottle ]' as compared with previously available plastic_bottles
continental asserts that monsanto had been unable to develop a satisfactory_bottle for hot-fill_applications and had therefore obtained this technology from yoshino

the district_court acknowledged the commercial_success of the conobase but stated that` we are not convinced that the conobase alone accounts for any of the success'
11 u.s.p.q.2d at 1770 emphasis in original
the court suggested that the commercial_success in japan was due to the market strength of the japanese licensees and held that there is no nexus between the merits of the product and its commercial_success
it is not necessary however that the patented invention be solely responsible for the commercial_success in order for this factor to be given weight appropriate to the evidence along with other pertinent factors
see generally demaco corp. v. f. von langsdorff licensing ltd. 851_f.2d_1387 1392-94 7_u.s.p.q.2d_1222 1226-28 fed.cir

monsanto also states that the conobase is different from the324 invention so that even were the conobase successful this does not inure to the benefit of the324_patent
it is apparent that the factual issues surrounding the objective_indicia were disputed and material

in view of the material_facts requiring resolution the issue of obviousness was not properly decided on motion for summary *1274 judgment
we vacate the grant based on 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 and remand for trial of this issue and the other_issues remaining in the case
