canton_bio-medical inc.` canton' appeals the decision of the united_states_district_court for the northern_district of new_york,1 granting the motion of integrated_liner_technologies inc.` ilt' for summary_judgment of non-infringement of cantons united states patent no._4499,148 under the doctrine of equivalents
the judgment is affirmed

the patented invention
both ilt and canton manufacture septa which are small disks used as closures for liquid-containing vessels
these septa have perforation and self-sealing properties whereby a needle may be inserted and withdrawn from the vessels without significant contamination or fluid loss
the septa made by ilt and canton are formed from plastic laminations of a layer of an elastomer such as a silicone_rubber and one or more layers of a polyolefin
the *1369 ¡¬ 148 patent is directed to the process by which these materials which are generally inert and difficult to bond are laminated to form septa having the desired properties

the ¡¬148_patent describes and claims a four-step process wherein the polyolefin_surface is treated with a corona_discharge primed with a specified primer_solution bonded to an uncured elastomer and cured by application of heat while applying pressure to the laminate
by this process a firm bond or` chemical_bridge' is formed between the polyolefin and the elastomer
claim 1 is the only claim in suit 1
a method of chemically bonding elastomeric materials to chemically inert polyolefins the method comprising [ a ] exposing a chemically inert polyolefin_surface to a corona_discharge_treatment [ b ] applying to the corona_discharge treated surface of the polyolefin a primer_solution of ethyl silicate ethyl orthosilicate and tetra butyl titanate in an organic solvent [ c ] placing the treated and primed surface of polyolefin in contact with the surface of an uncured elastomeric_compound of molecular weight above 61,000 with a minimum elongation modulus of fifty percent ; and [ d ] applying heat to the composite material to cure the elastomeric_compound while pressing the polyolefin elastomeric_compound article firmly together whereby upon curing of the elastomeric material the polyolefin will be firmly and securely bonded thereto

in the accused ilt_process the polyolefin_surface is also treated with a corona_discharge primed and laminated to an elastomer by treating with heat and application of pressure
ilt states that the patented and the accused processes differ in two ways
first ilt contends that it uses a different chemical primer_solution from that of step [ b ]
second ilt argues that the bonded elastomeric_compound in ilts process is not` uncured' as stated in step [ c ] before the treatment with heat and pressure in accordance with step [ d ]

because of the different chemicals used in the step [ b ] primer_solution canton agreed that ilts process does not literally infringe claim 1
the district_court held by summary_judgment that there was no infringement under the doctrine of equivalents based primarily on prosecution_history_estoppel
we affirm

the doctrine of equivalents
the determination of equivalency vel non is a question of fact
see pall corp. v. micron separations inc. 66_f.3d_1211 1218 36_uspq2d_1225 1229-30 fed.cir.1995
thus summary_judgment may be granted when no material_fact is in dispute or when no reasonable trier of fact could find facts whereby the nonmoving party could prevail even when all justifiable factual inferences are drawn in favor of the nonmovant
see anderson v. liberty lobby inc. 477_u.s._242 248 255 106_s.ct._2505 91_l.ed.2d_202_(1986)
the district_courts grant of summary_judgment receives plenary review on appeal see emi group n
am. inc. v. intel corp. 157_f.3d_887 891 48_uspq2d_1181 1184 fed.cir.1998 as does the courts ruling on the issue of prosecution_history_estoppel

processes are equivalent in terms of the law of patent infringement when there is no substantial difference between the patented_process and the accused process
see warner-jenkinson co. v. hilton davis chem co. 520_u.s._17 39-40 117_s.ct._1040 137_l.ed.2d_146 41_uspq2d_1865 1875 1997 also discussing the` function way result' criteria for determining equivalency but recognizing that this formula may provide a` poor *1370 framework' for analyzing chemical processes
infringement of process inventions is subject to the` all-elements_rule' whereby each of the claimed steps of a patented_process must be performed in an infringing process literally or by an equivalent of that step with due attention to the role of each step in the context of the patented invention
see id.at 29 40 520_u.s._17 117_s.ct._1040 137_l.ed.2d_146 41 uspq2d at 1871 1875
however even when technological equivalency is present the patentee is estopped from enforcing the patent against an equivalent process if the inventor surrendered during prosecution of the patent application claim scope which included the now-asserted element or its equivalent
see id.at 30-33 520_u.s._17 117_s.ct._1040 137_l.ed.2d_146 41 uspq2d at 1871-72

a. cantons claimed step [ b ] requires the application to a corona_discharge treated polyolefin_surface of a primer_solution containing ethyl silicate ethyl orthosilicate and tetrabutyl_titanate
the accused ilt_process also applies a primer to a corona_discharge treated polyolefin_surface
however the ilt primer_solution differs from cantons in that it is a solution of the compound n- 2-aminoethyl -3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane of the formula ch3o 3si ch2 3nhch2ch2nh2
canton states that ilts primer_solution containing this single_molecule is the chemical equivalent of cantons primer_solution containing three molecules based on insubstantial differences in the primers chemical and physical properties and functions including the identity or equivalency of their chemical functional groups their recognized interchangeability as bonding agents and their identical property of catalytic bonding when used as a primer for sealing silicone elastomer to corona_discharge treated polyolefin
canton argues that all of these considerations taken together provide factual support of equivalency sufficient to raise questions of material_fact as to equivalency and to defeat the grant of adverse summary_judgment

cantons expert submission showed that the ilt_primer_compound is a known silane coupling agent with known use in bonding silicone_elastomers to various_substrates
explaining the mechanism of the chemical interchangeability cantons expert testified that the methoxysilane portion of ilts compound functions in the same_way as the ethyl silicate and ethyl orthosilicate of the claimed primer in that the alkoxy groups of these molecules react with the hydroxyl groups on the corona_discharge treated resin surface to create a chemical_bridge of covalent bonds
he stated that this chemical behavior was well known for these compounds

cantons expert also stated that the diamino portion of the ilt compound functions in the same_way as the tetrabutyl_titanate of the canton composition in that both serve to catalyze the coupling reaction
he stated that this catalytic behavior was also well known
he explained that the only difference is that ilts primer contains the catalyst and coupling functions within a single_molecule while cantons primer uses three molecules to perform these same functions
the expert concluded as one skilled in the relevant field that the difference is` insubstantial'

no contrary evidence was presented by ilt although ilt now argues that the reaction mechanisms are different and that the diamine group of the ilt compound is involved in the chemical bonding and is not simply a catalyst
ilt concedes interchangeability of the primer_solutions but also argues that they are not equivalent as a matter of law citing the` all-elements_rule'
additionally ilt argues that the primers are not equivalent in fact because of their differences in chemical structure
*1371 finally ilt raises the issue of estoppel and states that it is practicing the prior_art

b
the district_court ruled that prosecution_history_estoppel bars liability under the doctrine of equivalents
ilt points out that its primer compound was included in a prior_art reference that canton distinguished in order to overcome the examiners objections to patentability of its process

during prosecution of the ¡¬148_patent application the examiner rejected all of the claims of cantons application on the ground of obviousness citing several reference patents that described alkoxysilane primers for bonding silicone_elastomers to various_substrates viz
u.s._patent_no._3667,993 stevenson u.s._patent_no._3794,556 young u.s. patent no._2976,185 mcbride us
patent no._3632,386 hurst and u.s. patent no._4332,844 hamada
the stevenson patent shows primer compositions containing various silicon compounds used in bonding silicone_rubbers to pretreated substrates
the young patent shows primers including ethyl silicates and tetrabutyl_titanate for adhering silicone_elastomers to substrates such as epoxy resins and polyurethanes
mcbride describes the bonding of polyolefins to silicones using a silicone-type primer to improve adhesion
hurst shows the corona_discharge_treatment of elastomers or polyolefins to increase adhesion and the use of a primer to facilitate bonding of elastomer to polyolefin
hamada describes two- and three-component primers for bonding silicone_elastomers to various_substrates using various combinations of silicates organotitanates and organohydrogen silicon compounds
among the specific compounds named by hamada are two of the components of cantons three-component primer the ethyl silicate and tetrabutyl_titanate as well as the specific trimethyoxyaminosilane used by ilt

in response to the examiners rejection canton argued that its invention was a` particular primer_solution' distinguished by its use of these three specific components from the extensive cited prior_art that included the ilt_primer_compound
in consideration of this argument the examiner withdrew the rejection
canton is thus estopped from asserting equivalency of the specific_primers in the cited references
although canton now argues that its invention is the combination of process steps and not solely the specific_primer claimed in step [ b ] the prosecution record shows that patentability was premised in significant part on this specific_primer and its distinction from the other primers described in the cited references

canton also argues that it did not amend its claims as to the primer
however amendment is not essential when argument is made and relied on to distinguish the claimed subject matter from the prior_art
see e.g. wang laboratories inc. v. mitsubishi elec
america inc. 103_f.3d_1571 1578 41_uspq2d_1263 1269 fed.cir.1997 arguments made to distinguish prior_art give rise to estoppel
canton is estopped from now reaching ilts prior_art primer under the doctrine of equivalents
on this ground the district_courts judgment is affirmed

c. in view of our affirmance of the judgment of non-infringement based on prosecution_history_estoppel we do not reach the other questions of equivalency
nor do we reach cantons objection to the district_courts denial of the discovery requested under fed.r.civ.p
56 f for the discovery was unrelated to the dispositive issue of the prosecution_history

affirmed
