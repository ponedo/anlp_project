i
background
the800_patent for an archery_bow_sight_assembly issued to carella on january 30 1968 on an application filed in the united states patent and trademark office pto on august 7 1967
it contains ten claims with claim 1 the only independent claim reading as follows an archery_bow_sight_assembly comprising support_means adapted for attachment generally parallel to the length of an archery_bow and a plurality of independent sights respectively connected to and each independently adjustable longitudinally along said support_means each of said sights defining a longitudinal_distance different from the longitudinal_distance defined by any one of the other sights so that said assembly may be attached to an archery_bow and each sight independently positioned relative to said support_means for properly aiming the bow by moving the bow to view a target at a distance from the bow through the respective sights until the apparent vertical height of the target equal the longitudinal_distance defined by one of said sights thereby properly aiming the bow for the particular_target
the carella bow sight has independently adjustable rings of calibrated sizes and a mount that permits overlapping of the rings
these features allow the carella bow sight to be used for simultaneous_range_finding and aiming

pro_line is in the business of the manufacture distribution and sale of archery related products including bow sights
starlight is a customer of pro_line but has also been a customer of carella

pro_line approached carella in 1973 and again in 1978 for a license to produce the carella bow sight but carella refused
pro_line sought advice from patent counsel in 1978_and_1980 on the validity of the carella800_patent
thereafter pro_line manufactured and sold its model m-525rf pro_line range finder hunting sight and m-5096rf pro_line range finder pins
the pro_line bow sight comprises a bracket with a single slot and a plurality of sight elements made from standard sight pins to which wire rings are threaded

on may_6,_1981 carella filed suit against starlight alleging that starlight had infringed the800_patent by selling pro_line sights and pro_line sight pins
pro_line intervened as a party defendant and filed counterclaims seeking a declaration of patent_invalidity and noninfringement damages and injunctive relief

in their answer and counterclaims appellants alleged the800_patent was invalid because 1 the claimed invention was anticipated by u.s._patent_no._3056,206206 issued to moore and by the schneider_rite-flite sight 2 the claimed invention was obvious in view of prior_art not considered by the pto during prosecution of the800_patent and 3 carella procured the800_patent by inequitable_conduct consisting of his failure to disclose to the pto the settlement of perkins v. carella civil no._3 1581 e.d.mich
august 5 1968 a declaratory judgment action and material prior_art
appellants also asserted that even if the800_patent were enforceable they had not infringed the patent and if they had infringed treble_damages and attorney fees were not warranted

the district_court held the800_patent infringed and not invalid and ordered pro_line to pay to carella $ 60,466.00 in lost profits together with $ 1,663.06 in costs and prejudgment_interest ; enjoined appellants from further_acts of infringement of the800_patent ; and dismissed pro_lines counterclaims
the court declined to award treble_damages and attorneys fees
it also denied appellants motion for reconsideration

ii
validity
the statutory presumption of patent validity imposes the burden of persuasion on one who attacks the validity of a patent
35 u.s.c.¡± 282
facts establishing anticipation or underlying a determination of obviousness must be proven by clear and convincing_evidence
rca corp. v. applied digital data systems inc. 730_f.2d_1440 1444 221_uspq_385 388 fed.cir.1984

a
anticipation
appellants contend that the claims of the800_patent are anticipated in accordance with the provisions of 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 by the moore206_patent
anticipation under section 102 requires` the presence in a single prior_art disclosure of all elements of a claimed invention arranged as in that claim'
panduit_corp. v. dennison manufacturing co. 774_f.2d_1082 1101 227_uspq_337 350 fed.cir.1985 quoting connell v. sears roebuck & co. 722_f.2d_1542 1548 220_uspq_193 198 fed.cir.1983

the district_court found that no single_prior_art_reference disclosed each and every element of the claimed invention
this court can not set aside the district_courts findings of fact unless persuaded that they are clearly erroneous
fed.r.civ.p
52 a
seattle box co. v. industrial crafting & packing inc. 731_f.2d_818 823 221_uspq_568 572 fed.cir.1984

with regard to the206_patent the district_court found that it did not teach or suggest use of circular sights for simultaneous_range_finding and aiming
based on this the court found no anticipation apparently determining that calibrated sights were necessary to simultaneous_range_finding and aiming in the manner claimed by carella
in other words taken in conjunction with the previous finding that no single_prior_art_reference discloses each and every element of the claimed invention we hold that the district_court was not clearly erroneous in finding that the206_patent did not clearly disclose a structure having` independently positioned' sights for simultaneous_range_finding and aiming i.e. a structure that enabled` properly aiming the bow for the particular_target'

appellants also claim anticipation under ¡± 102 a and b by the schneider_rite-flite_sight
they say it was known or used in this country and was described in printed publications a magazine and a mailer prepared by the wisconsin bow hunter association wbha prior to the invention date
in addition they say that it was on sale more than one year before carellas filing date

although in some circumstances unsupported oral testimony can be sufficient to prove prior knowledge or use it must be regarded with suspicion and subjected to close scrutiny
miner v. t.h
symington co. 250_u.s._383 386 39_s.ct._542 543-44 63_l.ed._1045_(1919) ; lockheed aircraft corp. v. united states 213_ct.cl._395 553_f.2d_69 75 193_uspq_449 455 1977

consistent with these principles the district_court explicitly rejected much of mr._schneiders deposition testimony given in the perkins v. carella case finding that only the following three relevant facts were established an advertisement for the rite-flite_sight appeared in a wbha mailer that was mailed on august 17 1966 ; mr._schneider began to sell his rite-flite_sight to the public after the mailing ; and an advertisement for the rite-flite_sight appeared in the july/august 1967 issue of bow & arrow magazine
in view of its *139 findings regarding carellas development of his invention the district_court concluded that these facts standing alone did not establish anticipation

the statutory language` known or used by others in this country' 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 a means knowledge or use which is accessible to the public
in re bass 474_f.2d_1276 1296 177_uspq_178 193 ccpa 1973 baldwin j. concurring ; in re borst 345_f.2d_851 854 145_uspq_554 556 ccpa 1965 ; see also kimberly-clark corp. v. johnson & johnson 745_f.2d_1437 1453 223_uspq_603 614 fed.cir.1984
here the court determined there was no credible evidence in the record indicating the rite-flite_sight was known or used by or was otherwise accessible to the public until after the mailing of the wbha advertisement on august 17 1966
one of our predecessor courts has stated that
one who wishes to characterize the information in whatever form it may be as a` printed publication' * * * should produce sufficient proof of its dissemination or that it has otherwise been available and accessible to persons concerned with the art to which the document relates and thus most likely to avail themselves of its contents
in re wyer 655_f.2d_221 227 210_uspq_790 795 ccpa 1981 quoting phillips electronics & pharmaceutical industries corp. v. thermal & electronic industries inc. 450_f.2d_1164 1171 171_uspq_641 646 3d cir.1971 ; in re bayer 568_f.2d_1357 196_uspq_670_(ccpa_1978) ; see also protein foundation inc. v. brenner 260_f.supp._519 520 151_uspq_561 562 d.d.c.1966 a magazine is effective as a printed publication under ¡± 102 on the date it reaches the addressee not on the date of mailing
no evidence was presented as to the date of receipt of the mailer by any of the addressees
similarly there was no evidence credited by the trial court of any sale that would cause a statutory bar

we conclude that the district_court was correct in holding there was no anticipation by the206_patent or rite-flite_sight

b. obviousness
appellants argue that the inventions set forth in the claims of the800_patent would have been obvious within the meaning of 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 in view of prior_art including the` v' sight the adjusta_sight u.s._patent_no._2991,556 issued to wilchek the moore206_patent and u.s._patent_no._2332,080 issued to howe

the test for determining obviousness was set forth in graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545 148_uspq_459_(1966) and requires the following factual inquiries under ¡± 103 the scope and content of the prior_art are to be determined ; differences between the prior_art and the claims at issue are to be ascertained ; and the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art resolved
against this background the obviousness or nonobviousness of the subject_matter is determined
such secondary considerations as commercial success long felt but unsolved need failure of others etc. might be utilized to give light to the circumstances surrounding the origin of the subject_matter sought to be patented
as indicia of obviousness or nonobviousness these inquiries may have relevancy
383 u.s. at 17-18 86 s.ct.at 694

the district_courts findings of fact relating to these inquiries must be accepted unless clearly erroneous
fed.r.civ.p
52 a ; carman industries inc. v. wahl 724_f.2d_932 938 220_uspq_481 486 fed.cir.1983

appellants point to certain language in the district_court opinion which they contend demonstrates that the court misapplied the graham test
they contend that the district_court compared a commercial_embodiment of carellas sight to the prior_art instead of the claims of the800_patent
although one finding of the court refers to a specific implementation of carellas concept other findings compare to the claims of the800_patent and we find no error resulting from the reference to a commercial_embodiment

*140 appellants also argue that the district_courts finding that` [ t ] he broad concept of simultaneous_range_finding and aiming taught by the carella patent was unknown to the prior_art' is clearly erroneous
the district_courts conclusion that the carella patent is not invalid due to obviousness is amply supported by the findings
the court acknowledged that use of vertical height for range_finding use of multiple elements on a sight and use of circular_apertures were each known in the art but concluded that the prior_art lacked any teaching or suggestion to combine the separate features in a manner permitting use of circular_apertures for simultaneous_range_finding and aiming
obviousness can not be established by combining the teachings of the prior_art to produce the claimed invention absent some teaching suggestion or incentive supporting the combination
acs hospital systems inc. v. montefiore hospital 732_f.2d_1572 1577 221_uspq_929 933 fed.cir.1984
here there was none and thus appellants are urging only hindsight_reconstruction

the court found that the adjusta_sight differs structurally from the carella_sight and that it requires adjustment for range_finding
although the` v' sight provides for simultaneous_range_finding and aiming a different_result on the issue of obviousness would not follow in view of the district_courts finding that the` v' sight uses a completely different structure from the carella_sight
furthermore the` v' sight like the adjusta_sight teaches away from use of multiple sights

we do not find the appellants arguments regarding howe or the contemporaneous developments in respect of moore schneider and perkins to be persuasive since they too represent hindsight_reconstruction or were fully considered by the district_court

for this court to reverse the judgment of the district_court we must be convinced not only that the district_court engaged in a faulty analysis in applying the law to the facts but also that a correct application of the law to those facts would bring a different_result
appellants have failed to convince us that under the ¡± 103 standard as interpreted by this court a different_result should follow on the issue of obviousness

iii
inequitable conduct and unenforceability
accusing carella of inequitable_conduct in failing to disclose the moore patent and the settlement in perkins v. carella to the pto appellants argue that the district_court erred in concluding that the800_patent was enforceable

inequitable conduct requires inter_alia proof by clear and convincing_evidence of a threshold degree of materiality of the nondisclosed information
atlas powder co. v. e.i
dupont de nemours & co. 750_f.2d_1569 1577-78 224_uspq_409 414-15 fed.cir.1984
the pertinency of information withheld from the examiner by an applicant is a question of fact and as such is subject to review under the clearly erroneous standard
american_hoist & derrick co. v. sowa & sons 725_f.2d_1350 220_uspq_763_(fed.cir.1984)

with regard to the moore_reference the district_court concluded that it added little to what was considered by the pto and found no inequitable_conduct on that basis
the district_court as we have previously indicated properly concluded that the moore_reference neither anticipated nor in combination with other references rendered obvious carellas claims
in view of this its evaluation of the materiality of the moore_reference is not clearly erroneous

citing precision instrument mfg co. v. automotive maintenance machinery co. 324_u.s._806 818-20 65_s.ct._993 999-1000 89_l.ed._1381 65_uspq_133 138-40 1945 and moog inc. v. pegasus lab. inc. 521_f.2d_501 504 187_uspq_279 281-82 6th cir.1975 appellants also say that failure to disclose the settlement in the perkins v. carella suit should have rendered carellas patent void ab initio
we have considered this argument but are unpersuaded
*141 the cited cases are inapposite because they deal specifically with failure to disclose in the context of an interference proceeding before the pto which is not present in this case

iv
damages
on the basis of the four-part test for recovery of lost profits set forth in panduit_corp. v. stahlin bros. fibre works inc. 575_f.2d_1152 197_uspq_726_(6th_cir.1978) * appellants assert that the district_courts award of lost profits was without support in the record
they argue that the court failed to make any findings as to carellas production and marketing capacity to meet demand for the sight and improperly placed the burden of proof on one element of the panduit_test the absence of acceptable non-infringing substitutes on them
appellants also assert that carella failed to provide detailed computations and supporting documentation on the amount of lost profits

this court accepted the panduit guidelines in central soya co. v. geo
a. hormel & co. 723_f.2d_1573 1578 n. 5 220_uspq_490 494 n. 5 fed.cir.1983 as a permissible way to establish entitlement to lost profits
it is not however the exclusive standard for determining entitlement to lost profits
bio-rad laboratories inc. v. niolet instrument corp. 739_f.2d_604 616 n. 222_uspq_654 663 n. fed.cir.1984

carella testified that his sight was unique
after extensive consideration of the prior_art the district_court found that only carellas sight and the infringing pro_line sight provided a similar combination of range_finding and aiming functions in a single element for instantaneous shooting
from this the number of sales by appellants was properly treated as an element in the computation of lost profits to carella
it was unnecessary for carella to negate every possibility that the purchasers might have bought another product
american_hoist & derrick co v. sowa & sons inc. 725 f.2d at 1365 220 uspq at 772

finally regarding the adequacy of the computation of lost profits mrs._carella testified as to the minimum profit made by carella on the sale of his complete sight assembly
obviously the amount of detailed testimony and documentation regarding computations of the patentees lost profits will vary with the size and complexity of the patentees company and with the extent to which that information is challenged or contradicted by the infringer
mrs._carellas testimony was unchallenged and uncontradicted
we therefore find no basis for concluding that the district_courts acceptance of this testimony was erroneous

conclusion
for the reasons stated above we affirm the district_court finding that the800_patent was infringed and not invalid
we also affirm its award of lost profits

affirmed
