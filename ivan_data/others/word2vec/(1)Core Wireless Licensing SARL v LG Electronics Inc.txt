background
the476 and020_patent s disclose improved display interfaces particularly for electronic_devices with small_screens like mobile_telephones
'020_patent 1_at_114-24
the improved interfaces allow a user to more quickly access desired data stored in and functions of applications included in the electronic_devices
id.at 2:20-44
an application_summary_window_displays` a limited_list of common_functions and commonly accessed stored data which itself can be reached directly from the main_menu listing some or all applications'
id.at 2:55-59
the application_summary_window can be reached in two steps` first launch a main_view which shows various_applications ; then launch the appropriate_summary_window for the application of interest'
id.at 2:61-64
the patents explain that the disclosed application_summary_window` is far faster and easier than conventional navigation approaches' particularly for devices with small_screens
id.at 2:64-65

core_wireless_licensing_s.a.r.l
(` core_wireless' sued lg alleging lg infringed dependent_claims 8_and_9 of the476_patent and dependent_claims 11_and_13 of the020_patent
claims 8_and_9 of the476_patent depend from claim 1 which recites emphases added 1
a computing_device comprising a display_screen the computing_device being configured to display on the screen a menu listing one or more_applications and additionally being configured to display on the screen an application_summary that can be reached directly from the menu wherein the application_summary displays a limited_list of data offered within the one or more_applications each of the data in the list being selectable to launch the respective_application and enable the selected data to be seen within the respective_application and wherein the application_summary is displayed while the one or more_applications are in an un-launched state
*1360 claims 11_and_13 of the020_patent depend from claim 1 which recites emphases added 1
a computing_device comprising a display_screen the computing_device being configured to display on the screen a main_menu listing at least a first_application and additionally being configured to display on the screen an application_summary_window that can be reached directly from the main_menu wherein the application_summary_window_displays a limited_list of at least one function offered within the first_application each function in the list being selectable to launch the first_application and initiate the selected function and wherein the application_summary_window is displayed while the application is in an un-launched state

lg moved for summary_judgment of invalidity of the asserted claims under 35 u.s.c.¡± 101 which the court denied
the district_court found claim 1 of the476_patent representative for the purposes of evaluating patent_eligibility
it held that the claims are not directed to an abstract_idea because even crediting lgs characterization of the claims as directed to` displaying an application_summary_window while the application is in an un-launched state' the concepts of` application'` summary_window' and` unlaunched_state' are specific to devices like computers and cell phones
j.a
9561
the court explained` lg identifie [ d ] no analog to these concepts outside the context of such devices'
id
it further noted even` if claim 1 were directed to an abstract_idea it would still be patent eligible at least because it passes the machine-or-transformation test'
j.a
9562

the case proceeded to trial and the district_court after hearing initial testimony determined` an o2 micro situation' existed with respect to the claim_terms` un-launched state' and` reached directly' and afforded both sides an opportunity to argue constructions of these terms
j.a
10277-78 ; see o2 micro int l ltd. v. beyond innovation tech co. 521_f.3d_1351 1362 fed
cir
2008` when the parties present a fundamental dispute regarding the scope of a claim_term it is the courts duty to resolve it`
the district_court ruled that` un-launched state' means` not displayed' and` reached directly' means` reached without an intervening step'

the jury found all asserted claims infringed and not invalid
lg moved for judgment as matter of law of noninfringement arguing in part that a correct_construction of` un-launched state' means` not running' and that under this construction no reasonable_jury could have found infringement
lg also argued that the` reached directly' limitation required user interaction with the main_menu and no reasonable_jury could have found infringement under such a construction
the district_court declined to revisit claim_construction noting lg did not preserve its claim_construction arguments in a rule 50 a motion
the district_court further denied lgs motion for judgment as a matter of law of noninfringement based on the courts adopted constructions because evidence was presented at trial from which the jury reasonably could have found that the application_summary_window in the accused devices could be reached directly from the main_menu

the district_court also denied lgs motion for judgment of a matter of law of anticipation by blanchard
although core_wireless elected not to call an expert to testify in rebuttal to lgs validity expert the district_court noted that the jury was not required to credit lgs expert_testimony and concluded` lg failed to overcome the presumption of validity accorded to the476 and020_patent s by clear and convincing_evidence'

patent eligibility
anyone who` invents or discovers any new and useful process machine manufacture or composition of matter or any new and useful improvement thereof' may obtain a patent
35 u.s.c.¡± 101
because patent protection does not extend to claims that monopolize the` building_blocks of human ingenuity' claims directed to laws of nature natural_phenomena and abstract_ideas are not patent eligible
alice corp. pty
v. cls bank int l -- - u.s. -- -- 134_s.ct._2347 2354 189_l.ed.2d_296_(2014)
the supreme court instructs courts to distinguish between claims that claim patent_ineligible_subject_matter and those that` integrate the building_blocks into something more'
id
first we` determine whether the claims at issue are directed to a patent-ineligible concept'
id.at 2355
if so we` examine the elements of the claim to determine whether it contains aninventive concept sufficient totransform the claimed abstract_idea into a patent-eligible application'

thales visionix inc. v. united states 850_f.3d_1343 1347 fed
cir
2017
although there is` difficulty inherent in delineating the contours of an abstract_idea' visual_memory 867 f.3d at 1259 we must be mindful that` all inventions at some level embody use reflect rest upon or apply laws of nature natural_phenomena or abstract_ideas'
mayo 566 u.s. at 71 132_s.ct._1289
we also ask whether the claims are directed to a specific_improvement in the capabilities of computing_devices or instead` a process *1362 that qualifies as anabstract_idea for which computers are invoked merely as a tool'
enfish llc v. microsoft_corp. 822_f.3d_1327 1336 fed
cir
2016

we previously have held claims focused on various improvements of systems directed to patent_eligible_subject_matter under ¡± 101
for example in enfish we held claims reciting a self-referential_table for a computer database eligible under step one because the claims were directed to a particular improvement in the computers functionality
822 f.3d at 1336
that the invention ran on a general-purpose computer did not doom the claims because unlike claims that merely` add [ ] conventional computer components to well-known business practices' the claimed self-referential_table was` a specific type of data structure designed to improve the way a computer stores and retrieves data in memory'
id.at 1338-39
in thales we held claims reciting an improved method of utilizing inertial sensors to determine position and orientation of an object on a moving platform not directed to an abstract_idea or law of nature
850 f.3d at 1349
we noted that even though the system used conventional sensors and a mathematical equation the claims specified a particular configuration of the sensors and a particular method of utilizing the raw data that eliminated many of the complications inherent in conventional methods
id.at 1348-49
in visual_memory we held claims directed to an improved computer memory system with programmable operational characteristics defined by the processor directed to patent-eligible subject matter
867 f.3d at 1259
the claimed invention provided flexibility that prior_art processors did not possess and obviated the need to design a separate memory system for each type of processor
id
and most recently in finjan inc. v. blue coat systems inc. we held claims directed to a behavior-based virus scanning method directed to patent_eligible_subject_matter because they` employ [ ] a new kind of file that enables a computer security system to do things it could not do before' including` accumulat [ ing ] and utiliz [ ing ] newly available behavior-based information about potential threats'
879_f.3d_1299 2018_wl_341882_(fed._cir._jan._10,_2018)
the claimed behavior-based scans in contrast to prior_art systems which searched for matching code enabled more` nuanced virus filtering' in analyzing whether` a downloadables code.. performs potentially dangerous or unwanted operations'
id.at 1304 2018_wl_341882 at *3
we held the claims` therefore directed to a non-abstract improvement in functionality rather than the abstract_idea of computer security writ large'
id.at 1305 2018_wl_341882 at *4

the asserted claims in this case are directed to an improved_user_interface for computing_devices not to the abstract_idea of an index as argued by lg on appeal.3 although the generic idea of summarizing information certainly existed prior to the invention these claims are directed to a particular_manner of summarizing and presenting information in electronic_devices
claim 1 of the476_patent requires` an application_summary that can be reached directly from the menu' specifying a particular_manner by which the summary_window must be accessed
the claim further requires the application_summary_window list a limited_set of data` each of the data in the list being selectable to launch the respective_application and enable the selected data to be seen within the respective_application'
this claim_limitation *1363 restrains the type of data that can be displayed in the summary_window
finally the claim recites that the summary_window` is displayed while the one or more_applications are in an un-launched state' a requirement that the device applications exist in a particular state
these limitations disclose a specific manner of displaying a limited_set of information to the user rather than using conventional user interface methods to display a generic index on a computer
like the improved systems claimed in enfish thales visual_memory and finjan these claims recite a specific_improvement over prior systems resulting in an improved_user_interface for electronic_devices

the specification confirms that these claims disclose an improved_user_interface for electronic_devices particularly those with small_screens
it teaches that the prior_art_interfaces had many deficits relating to the efficient functioning of the computer requiring a user` to scroll around and switch views_many_times to find the right_data/functionality'
'020_patent at 1:47-49
because small_screens` tend to need data and functionality divided into many_layers or views' id.at 1:29-30 prior_art_interfaces required users to drill down through many_layers to get to desired data or functionality
id.at 1:29-37
that process could` seem slow complex and difficult to learn particularly to novice users'
id.at 1:45-46

the disclosed invention improves the efficiency of using the electronic_device by bringing together` a limited_list of common_functions and commonly accessed stored data' which can be accessed directly from the main_menu
id.at 2:55-59
displaying selected data or functions of interest in the summary_window allows the user to see the most relevant data or functions` without actually opening the application up'
id.at 3:53-55
the speed of a users navigation through various views and windows can be improved because it` saves the user from navigating to the required application opening it up and then navigating within that application to enable the data of interest to be seen or a function of interest to be activated'
id.at 2:35-39
rather than paging through multiple screens of options` only three steps may be needed from start up to reaching the required data/functionality'
id.at 3:2-3
this language clearly indicates that the claims are directed to an improvement in the functioning of computers particularly those with small_screens

because we hold that the asserted claims are not directed to an abstract_idea we do not proceed to the second_step of the inquiry
the claims are patent eligible under ¡± 101

ii
anticipation
the blanchard reference teaches a display_screen for mobile phones that` provides an arrangement for dynamically varying how space on a small display is allocated for presentation of various types of user information'
j.a
13097_at_153-57
it discloses hierarchical menu screens displaying a series of selectable sub-level menu choices through which a user can cycle
the display changes dynamically as the user makes selections ; for example selecting a function such as` phone book' will display options related to that function such as` add entry'

lg argues it established by clear and convincing_evidence that blanchard discloses each element of the asserted claims
it first submits that core_wireless based its arguments distinguishing the asserted claims from blanchard during closing argument and post-trial briefing on elements not recited by the asserted claims
it further submits that because it presented a prima facie case of anticipation and core_wireless failed to present any affirmative *1364 evidence in rebuttal it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law that blanchard anticipates the asserted claims
we disagree

a patent is presumed valid and the burden of establishing invalidity of a claim rests on the party asserting invalidity by clear and convincing_evidence
35 u.s.c.¡± 282 ; microsoft_corp. v. i4i ltd. p'ship 564_u.s._91 95 131_s.ct._2238 180_l.ed.2d_131_(2011)
an alleged_infringer asserting a defense of invalidity also has` the initial burden of going forward with evidence to support its invalidity allegation'
titan tire corp. v. case new holland inc. 566_f.3d_1372 1376 fed
cir
2009
once that evidence has been presented the` burden of going forward shifts to the patentee to present contrary evidence and argument'
id.at 1376-77
ultimately however the outcome of an alleged_infringers invalidity defense at trial depends on whether the alleged_infringer` has carried its burden of persuasion to prove by clear and convincing_evidence that the patent is invalid'
id.at 1377
because the burden rests with the alleged_infringer to present clear and convincing_evidence supporting a finding of invalidity granting judgment as a matter of law for the party carrying the burden of proof is generally` reserved for extreme cases' such as when the opposing partys witness makes a key admission

1968` [ w ] hen the party moving for a directed verdict has such a burden the evidence to support the granting of the motion must be so one-sided as to be of over-whelming effect
``

this is not one such extreme case
while lg presented the testimony of dr._rhyne the only expert who testified regarding anticipation core_wireless cross-examined dr._rhyne illuminating for the jury reasons why dr._rhynes opinion was incorrect
for example dr._rhyne testified that blanchard discloses the` limited_list' of data and functions recited in the asserted claims because blanchard figure 3 displays only three of the five functions of the phone_book_application
but on cross-examination when asked if all five functions were` available through this menu' dr._rhyne admitted that all five functions of the phone_book_application were available through blanchards disclosed menus` you can reach all of them-you can bring them all to the face of the screen if thats what you mean'
j.a
10741
viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict we can not say that this is a case in which the evidence points so strongly and overwhelming in favor of lg that reasonable_jurors could not arrive at any contrary_conclusion
a reasonable_jury could have heard the cross-examination of dr._rhyne and concluded blanchard did not disclose the` limited_list' limitation in the claims because a user could access the additional functions in blanchard by keying down within the summary display window
core_wireless had the right to choose to use its limited trial clock for other purposes where it believed-perhaps at its own risk-that lgs evidence had been adequately impeached
and the jury was entitled to evaluate dr._rhynes testimony and determine whether lg clearly and convincingly established that blanchard anticipates the claims

the district_court in denying lgs motion for judgment as a matter of law did not hold that the presumption of validity` saved' the claims in the face of unrebutted evidence
the court merely made the unremarkable observation that the jury was not required` to give full credit and acceptance to the testimony of dr
rhyne'
j.a

we agree with the district_court and affirm its denial of lgs motion for judgment as a matter of law of anticipation

*1365 iii
infringement
lg presents two noninfringement arguments on appeal
first lg argues the correct_construction of` unlaunched_state' is` not running' rather than` not displayed' as the district_court held and the accused devices do not infringe under its proposed construction.4 second lg argues that no reasonable_jury could find that the accused devices satisfy the` reached directly from the [ main ] menu' limitations in the claims because the accused application_summary_window is reached from the status_bar which is not part of the menu
we reject both arguments

`` [ t ] he ultimate issue of the proper construction of a claim should be treated as a question of law' which we review de novo
teva_pharm usa inc. v. sandoz inc. -- - u.s. -- -- 135_s.ct._831 838 -- - l.ed.2d -- -- 2015
any subsidiary factual findings related to claim_construction are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard
id
in construing the claims we consider` the words of the claims themselves the specification the prosecution_history and if necessary any relevant extrinsic_evidence'
advanced steel recovery llc v. x-body equip. inc. 808_f.3d_1313 1317 fed
cir
2015
`` [ w ] hen the district_court reviews only_evidence intrinsic to the patent the patent claims and specifications along with the patents prosecution_history the judges determination will amount solely to a determination of law'
teva_pharm
usa inc. 135 s.ct.at 841

first we consider the construction of` un-launched state'
while this is a close case for which the intrinsic_evidence could plausibly be read to support either party we see no error in the district_courts construction of` un-launched state' to mean` not displayed'
such a construction encompasses both applications that are not running at all and applications that are running at least to some extent in the background of the electronic_device
see j.a
10283 core_wireless expert testifying that an un-launched application is` either not executing code or not visible to the user'

the stated focus of the invention is to` allow the user to navigate quickly and efficiently to access data and activate a desired function' on devices with small_screens
'020_patent at 1:26-29
the invention identifies as problematic the conventional user interfaces in which` a user may need to scroll around and switch views_many_times to find the right_data/functionality'
id.at 1:47-49
for instance the specification does not identify the memory_drain that running applications may have on the system as a problem it aims to solve-it only concerns itself with maximizing the benefit of the` common_functions and commonly accessed data' actually displayed to the user
id.at 2:26-30 ; see id.at 4:36-39` the mobile_telephone may be able to learn what functionality and/or stored data types are most likely to be of interest to a given user and which should therefore be included in a summary view to any given user
``

the terms` display' and` launch' are used throughout the specification to convey that a particular view is displayed to the user
the specification states the following when describing the advantages in user navigation achieved by the invention [ a ] user can get to the summary_window in just two steps-first launch a main_view which shows various_applications ; then launch the appropriate_summary_window for the application of interest
this is far faster and easier than conventional *1366 navigation approaches
once the summary_window is launched core_data/functionality is displayed and can be accessed in more detail can typically be reached simply by selecting that data/functionality
id.at 2:59-3:2 emphases added
in this passage` launch' is used to describe what is displayed to the user when they select various_menu_options not to indicate that an application is running

this understanding is confirmed by the patents use of the word` running'
while the specification uses the term` display' throughout it only uses the term` running' or any modification of the term one time` there is a computer_program which when running on a computing_device such as a mobile_telephone enables the device to operate in accordance with the above aspects of the invention
the program may be an operating_system'
id.at 2:40-44
therefore when the patent teaches that a user` launch [ es ] a main_view' or` launch [ es ] the appropriate_summary_window' the computer_program or operating_system implementing the summary program is already running
id.at 2:59-3:2
similarly each patent only has one independent claim which uses the term` running' and it is used to describe the overall` computer_program product' that implements the claimed functionality not a device application
'020_patent at 6:20-32 claim 16 ;476_patent at 6:30-43 claim 11
these claims further recite an application` in an unlaunched_state'
if the patentee intended` unlaunched' to mean` not running' it knew how to express as much

figure 3 which is identical for both patents further confirms this construction of` unlaunched_state'
in figure 3 the summary_window indicates that under the` messages' application there are` 3 unread emails'` 2 new sms' messages and` 1 chat ongoing'
'020_patent at fig._3 emphasis added
the use of the word` ongoing' as opposed to a word like` received' indicates that in at least some embodiments of the invention at least some subset of processes of the messages_application are already running
the specification confirms that the application_summary_window reflects information that is something more than mere notifications from an application` app_snapshots are not intended to replace notifications but to complement them by providing non-intrusive reminders for the user as well as rapid shortcuts to key application functionality'
id.at 4:32-35

the specification also describes a preferred_embodiment in which` the constituency of the app_snapshot may vary with the environment in which the mobile_telephone finds itself'
id.at 4:47-49 emphasis added
it explains` if the telephone is bluetooth enabled then there may be a bluetooth application which has associated with it a summary_window which lists the other bluetooth devices in the vicinity'
id.at 4:49-52
moreover claim 6 of the020_patent and claim 5 of the476_patent both require that the data or functionality displayed` varies with the environment of the device'
lg has not articulated how an application with data in the application_summary_window that varies as the location of the device changes can operate without having the application` running' in some manner
while the full bluetooth application may not be` running' at least some subset of that applications processes must be running in order to update the available devices in the application_summary_window

the bluetooth embodiment and the messages embodiment displayed in figure 3 are consistent with core_wireless argument during the o2 micro hearing that a launched application is executing code and visible to the user
an unlaunched application therefore is` either not executing *1367 code or not visible to the user'
j.a
10283 emphases added
the specification does not teach that the application_summary_window performs limited processes on behalf of the unlaunched applications
lgs proposed construction of` un-launched' as` not running' would impermissibly read these preferred_embodiments out of the claims

lg argues that the specification uses` launch' and` display' to express different ideas
for example the specification explains` the app_snapshot can therefore display data from an application and functions of that application without actually opening the application up only once a user has selected an item in the app_snapshot associated with a given application does that application have to be opened'
'020_patent at 3:53-58 emphases added
this passage does not contradict the district_courts construction
the passage does not state that the application_summary_window_displays the application without actually opening the application up
the specifications statement that the app_snapshot` display [ s ]' data without the selected application being` opened' does not without more indicate that a previously unopened application was not running at least some subset of processes
similarly the dissents interpretation assumes that displaying an application necessarily requires display of particular data
wallach op.at 1369-71
the specification demonstrates this not to be true
when a user selects data from the summary_window e.g. a commonly emailed contact` the display then changes to a new email form seeded with [ the ] email address and all the user need do is input some body text and hit ado it button'
'020_patent at 5:5-19
this is different from displaying an email application without this pre-loaded data which does not` enable the selected data to be seen within the respective_application'
'476_patent claim 1

the patentee did not clearly and unmistakably disclaim or limit the construction of` unlaunched_state' during prosecution as lg argues
the doctrine of prosecution disclaimer precludes patentees from recapturing the full scope of a claim_term only when the patentee clearly and unmistakably disavows a certain meaning in order to obtain the patent

when the alleged disclaimer is ambiguous or amenable to multiple reasonable interpretations we decline to find prosecution disclaimer
id

the patentees statements during prosecution do not amount to a clear and unmistakable disclaimer restricting the meaning of` un-launched state' only to those applications that are not running any processes
during prosecution the patentee distinguished the claims from prior_art u.s. patent no._6781,611` richard'
richard teaches a method` for switching between multiple open_windows in multiple applications on a computer desktop'
j.a
1446big_token__1_at_1__big_token38-40
the examiner pointed to richard_figure 6 in which` the user has two applications appa and appb.. open on a desktop' the top window being appa
j.a
14459 14462_at_320-26
a plurality of windows are open within appb and when the user clicks and holds the arrow on the application_button for appb on the taskbar a pop-up menu appears displaying the three open_windows within appb
in distinguishing the invention from richard the patentee stated that the main_menu of richard is` a menu of open_windows within a single application i.e. a launched application
it follows from the fact the windows are open within the application that the application must be running and therefore has been launched'
j.a
12764 emphases in original
this statement is consistent with the district_courts construction
both appa and appb in richard_figure 6 are *1368 displayed to the user
while appa takes up most of the display area in this figure appb is also displayed to the user in the form of the application_button on the taskbar
indeed richard specifically teaches that the arrow on the application_button for appb` serves as a visual indicator that there are a plurality of windows open in appb'
j.a
14462_at_335-37 emphasis added
core_wireless admits that an application that is displayed must be running
oral arg.at 20:32-40
because appb in richard_figure 6 is displayed and running the patentees statement during prosecution that appb must be` launched' is fully consistent with the construction that` un-launched state' means` not displayed'

because the claim_language specification and prosecution_history all support the district_courts construction we agree with the district_court that the correct_construction of` un-launched state' is` not displayed'

second substantial_evidence supports the jurys verdict of infringement based on the` reached directly from the [ main ] menu' claim_limitation
lg argues no reasonable_jury could find the accused devices satisfy this limitation because the evidence at trial established that the status_bar was distinct from a` main_menu'
we do not agree

there is no dispute on appeal how the accused devices work
the devices have a primary home_screen display comprising a series of icons along the bottom of the display corresponding to applications like gmail and phone
the entire home_screen display is the accused` main_menu'
along the top of the home_screen display a status_bar displays the time battery status signal strength and other data
the accused application_summary_window is the lg devices notification_shade which the user accesses by swiping down from the status_bar

the jury heard conflicting evidence regarding whether the status_bar is part of the accused` home_screen'
dr._rhyne testified that the status_bar is` not part of the home_screen' because the home_screen is the part of the screen between the status_bar at the top and the navigation bar at the bottom of the display
j.a
10603-04
he further testified that the user` can open [ the notification_shade ] up in almost any application' not just the main home_screen view
j.a
10604-05
core_wireless infringement expert agreed that a user can reach the notification_shade from the status_bar while any application is displayed in the central view
core_wireless presented evidence however that the status_bar is part of the home_screen
core_wireless expert dr._zeger acknowledged that when an application is open and displayed the user does not reach the notification_shade directly from the main_menu` because there was an intervening step' of opening up the application from the main_menu
j.a
10315
but he testified that when the main_menu is displayed and the user pulls down the notification_shade the user reaches the accused application_summary_window directly from the main_menu
core_wireless also presented lgs user manual to the jury which expressly identifies the status_bar as part of the home_screen

the parties dispute boils down to whether the status_bar is part of the accused` home_screen'
this is a fact question that we presume the jury resolved in favor of core_wireless and substantial_evidence supports the jurys finding
in the lg user manual the status_bar is the first section of the view identified as the home_screen
the jury was also entitled to credit dr._zegers testimony on this issue
indeed dr._rhyne admitted that if the status_bar is part of the home_screen the user can reach the accused application_summary_window directly from the main *1369 menu
we conclude that substantial_evidence supports the jurys finding of infringement

conclusion
for the foregoing reasons we affirm the district_courts denial of summary_judgment that the claims are ineligible under 35 u.s.c.¡± 101
we also affirm the district_courts denial of judgment as a matter of law that the claims are anticipated by blanchard and the claims are not infringed

affirmed

the district_court erred in its claim construction of` un-launched state' the district_court construed the term` un-launched state' during a pretrial conference *1370 to mean` not displayed' and maintained that construction in its post-trial denial of judgment as a matter of law
see core_wireless 2016_wl_4440255 at *4-5 ; j.a
10297
lg argues that the term` un-launched state' should mean` not running'
appellants br
30 ; see id.at 30-48
i agree with lg
consistent with claim_construction principles i look first to the language of the claims followed by the remainder of the specifications language and prosecution_history
see phillips 415 f.3d at 1315

first the claims state in part that an application_summary` displays' certain data offered in applications ; each of the data is` selectable to launch the respective_application and enable the selected data to be seen' ; and the application_summary is` displayed while the one or more_applications are in an un-launched state'
'476_patent col. 5_l._60 -col. 6_l._3_(claim_1)2` display' is used differently and independently from` launch' in the claims which indicates these terms have different_meanings
in addition by separating` launch' and` enable the selected data to be seen' the claims contemplate a difference between launching and displaying data

exch. llc 677_f.3d_1361 1369 fed
cir
2012 applying a` general presumption that different [ claim ] terms have different_meanings'
further the claim_language distinguishes between` launch [ ing ] the respective_application' itself and` enab [ ling ] the selected data.. within' the application to be seen
'476_patent col. 5_l._66 -col. 6_l._1_(emphasis_added)
such a distinction would be rendered meaningless if launch were construed to mean` display'
see merck & co. v. teva_pharm
usa inc. 395_f.3d_1364 1372 fed
cir
2005` a claim_construction that gives meaning to all the terms of the claim is preferred over one that does not do so'
( citation omitted
moreover i do not understand what` displaying' the application itself would mean in this context where the claim_language more specifically directs the invention to enable only certain` data' pre-viewed in the application_summary to be seen
see innova/pure water inc. v. safari water filtration sys. inc. 381_f.3d_1111 1119 fed
cir
2004` [ w ] hen an applicant uses different_terms in a claim it is permissible to infer that he intended his choice of different_terms to reflect a differentiation in meaning of those terms
``

second the specification uses the terms` launch' and` display' distinctly
see476_patent col. 3_ll._10 -11` once the summary_window is launched core_data/functionality is displayed`
this could either mean the terms are distinct or as the majority finds that launch is synonymous with display
see maj. op.at 1365-67
as stated previously based on claim differentiation principles i find it more likely that` launch' is a first step of independent meaning and` display' is a step that comes second after the` summary_window' has been launched
appellee core_wireless_licensing_s.a.r.l
(` core_wireless' contends that the statement` a user can.. launch a main_view which shows various_applications'476_patent col. 3_ll._5 -7 supports its argument that` launch' refers to granting` visual_access' because the language of the specification uses the term` view' appellees br
21
however the term` main_view' refers to and is synonymous with the summary application window
see476_patent col. 3_ll._5 -7 17-33 ; id
figs.1-3
referring to this particular page using the term` view' does not confer additional meaning on the verb` launch'

*1371 additional language in the specification in support of lgs construction states that previously users would` locate'` then start/open the required application'` and then may need to.. cause the required stored data.. to be displayed'
id
col. 1_ll._51 -55 emphasis added
again the specification contemplates display and opening as two separate steps in the users process which leads me to the conclusion that` display' and` open' are not synonymous and that the drafters of the patents-in-suit knew how to use the term` display' when conveying visual_access to an applications contents.3 i also note that the specification explicitly defines the term` idle screen' as` a display which is shown when the mobile_telephone is switched on but not in use' id
col. 2_ll._10 -12 which indicates the drafters of the patents-in-suit knew how to define a single term that contained two separate meanings here one related to display and one related to operation and believed such an explanation would be necessary for terms that on their face did not contain a dual meaning
for that reason i am skeptical of the majoritys understanding that the term` un-launched'` encompasses both applications that are not running at all and applications that are running at least to some extent in the background of the electronic_device
`` 4 maj. op.at 1365

i also agree with lgs contention that the specification teaches the invention was directed to a problem in line with its construction of the term` un-launched state' or at least that the problems in the field are inconclusive to weigh in favor of either partys proposed construction
lg asserts that the invention is directed to saving` the user from navigating to the required application opening it up and then navigating within that application'
appellants br
32 quoting476_patent col. 2_ll._46 -50
again construction hinges on our understanding of the term` open' in this phrase and whether it refers to running or displaying an application
no matter the construction of launch though the claimed invention seeks to improve access to the large amount of information stored in small computing_devices
see e.g.476_patent col. 2_l._66 -col. 3_l._6_(discussing_invention's_''advantages_in_ease_and_speed_of_navigation,_particularly_on_small_screen_devices'')
it seems to me that the default state of the applications storing this information when a user navigates through the claimed summary_application_menu does not affect the utility of the claimed invention

the majority identifies the stated focus of the inventions as to` allow the user to navigate quickly and efficiently to access data and activate a desired function' on small_screens
maj. op.at 1365 quoting020_patent col. 1_ll._26 -29
therefore it finds the absence of an explicitly stated goal such as` memory_drain' a problem which appears to be of the majoritys own creation to be instructive in its construction of the term` un-launched' because the invention` only concerns itself with maximizing the benefit of thecommon_functions and commonly accessed data actually *1372 displayed to the user'
id.at 1365 quoting020_patent col. 4_ll._36 -39
in our claim_construction analysis we look not to what is absent from the specification or what could have been written but rather to what is included
see merck & co. v. teva_pharm
usa inc. 347_f.3d_1367 1371 fed
cir
2003` a fundamental rule of claim_construction is that the terms in a patent_document are construed with the meaning with which they are presented in the patent_document
thus claims must be construed so as to be consistent with the specification..' emphasis added citations omitted
here as mentioned above the focus of the invention identified by the majority can support either partys construction of the disputed term
the use of an application_summary menu to congregate data from myriad applications on a small screen computing_device benefits users in the manner stated regardless of whether the applications are running in the background
moreover in other parts of the specification the invention is directed towards` effectively enabling the user to understand th [ e devices ] changing internal state' through offering on the application_menu page a list of` common_functions offered within an application and/or.. data stored in that application'
'476_patent col. 2_ll._22 -24 34-36
here again enabling a user to better understand options offered by applications and data stored within them are goals that are successfully achieved with applications that are not running until selected from the main_menu

third the prosecution_history further supports lgs proffered construction
even if core_wireless did not disclaim its professed interpretation that` launch' means` display' 5 i would nevertheless find lgs interpretation of` un-launched' comports more closely with the overall language of the patents-in-suit and prosecution_history
see phillips 415 f.3d at 1316
indeed during prosecution core_wireless distinguished the asserted_claims from those in the prior_art because unlike the prior_art its claims did not` only ever display [ ]' the summary_application_menu` within a running instance of the program i.e. only when the program is in a launched state'
j.a
12764 emphasis added
thus core_wireless used the term` launch' to mean running not merely displayed
see j.a
12765 stating in another portion of core_wirelesss amendment that 1 the` underlying purpose' of the claimed invention is that it overcomes the prior_art in which information about applications in the summary_application_menu` is not displayed until after the application is already running' and 2 the prior_art` relate [ s ] to running applications and combining them does nothing to satisfy the requirement of the present claims that the application_summary_window is displayed without launching the application' emphasis added

the majority adopts core_wirelesss argument that construing` un-launched' to mean` not running' would exclude certain preferred_embodiments in the specification see maj. op.at 1366-67 ; see also appellees br
28-29 contrary to our courts instruction that a construction` that excludes a preferred_embodiment from the scope of the claim is rarely if ever correct' mbo labs. inc. v. becton dickinson & co. 474_f.3d_1323 1333 fed
cir
2007 internal_quotation_marks and citation omitted
specifically figure 3 illustrates an application window that indicates there is an ongoing chat not seen on the *1373 screen
see020_patent fig.3 ;476_patent fig.3
the majority states that` use of the wordongoing as opposed to a word likereceived indicates that in at least some embodiments of the invention at least some subset of processes of the messages_application are already running'
maj. op.at 1366
yet core_wireless has not presented evidence in the form of expert_testimony or otherwise to suggest that the display in the application_menu of new messages or the use of the term ongoing in the summary menu would be understood by a person having ordinary skill in the art to indicate the underlying application is running
core_wireless presents only attorney argument not evidence
see gemtron corp. v. saint-gobain corp. 572_f.3d_1371 1380 fed
cir
2009` [ u ] nsworn attorney argument.. is not evidence and can not re-but.. admitted evidence'
( citation omitted ; appellees br
28-29
moreover i do not believe construing` unlaunched' to mean` not running' would be inconsistent with this preferred_embodiment since the requirements of claim 1 only state that` one or more_applications' are in an un-launched state
'476_patent col. 6_ll._2 -3 ; see020_patent col. 5_ll._35 43 requiring` at least a first_application' that is` in an un-launched state'
therefore even if` ongoing' were to imply a running application the application_menu display of messages from a non-running message application would still satisfy the requirements of claim 1 of the patents-in-suit.6

accordingly i would reverse the district_courts claim_construction of` un-launched state' and construe the term to mean` not running'
given this claim_construction i would remand for further findings on infringement and anticipation
i respectfully dissent

concern remains regarding whether we have jurisdiction to review the appeal of validity and infringement determinations while damages remains unresolved and will be the subject of a future jury trial
