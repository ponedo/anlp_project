because the court erred as a matter of law in failing to find claims 1_and_5 of the ¡¬969_patent to have been obvious and in finding infringement of those claims we reverse

background
ball_aerosol and specialty_container inc.` basc' owns the ¡¬969_patent by assignment from former employee jivan kumar kholsa
the ¡¬969_patent claims a candle_tin with a removable_cover that also acts as a base for the candle_holder
when a candle_holder is placed directly on a table or other surface the heat of the lit candle can cause scorching or damage to the surface
putting a candle_tin in the configuration claimed in the ¡¬969_patent with the candle_holder resting on top of the cover minimizes this scorching by removing the candle_holder from direct contact with the underlying surface
the ¡¬969_patent also claims protrusions or feet on the closed_end of the candle_holder that rest on top of the closed_end of the cover when it is used as a base as depicted in the figure below

*987. ?
¡¬969_patent fig.1 b

in 2003 limited designed the accused travel_candle which is a square-shaped candle_tin with a removable_cover and four protrusions on the closed_end of the candle_holder
on october 25 2004 basc sued limited for infringement in the united_states_district_court for the eastern district of michigan
the case was transferred to the northern_district of illinois on may_31,_2005
basc ultimately limited its allegations of infringement to claims 1_and_5 of the ¡¬ 969 patent which read as follows 1
a candle_tin_comprising a hollow candle_holder closed at one end in which a candle is disposed the candle having a wick for the candle to burn when the wick is lit the lit candle producing heat a portion of which is transferred through the holder to a surface upon which the candle_tin is placed ; a cover sized to fit over the holder and removably placed over an open_end of the holder to cover the candle when the candle is not lit the cover when removed being placed upon the surface with the holder being set upon the cover for the cover to support the holder above the surface whereby the heat generated by the burning candle does not damage the surface the holder and cover being cup shaped with the cover placed upon the surface_open_end down so a closed_end of the cover supports the holder above the surface a closed_end of the holder being adjacent the closed_end of the cover ; and protrusions formed on the closed_end of the holder and extending therefrom the protrusions resting upon the closed_end of the cover to seat the holder on the cover

on april_19,_2006 the district_court construed the term` to seat' to mean` to either rest on or fit into the cover'
claim_construction_opinion 2006_wl_1049581 at *2
the parties had disagreed on whether the portion of claims 1_and_5 relating to the protrusions required that they lock in or engage the closed_end of the cover in some way when the candle_tin was configured as described in the claims i.e. with the candle_holder resting on top of the cover
the court reasoned that because not all of the figures in the patent showed the feet on the bottom of the candle_holder fitting into recesses in the closed_end of the cover when the candle was in this configuration the term` to seat' did not require an engagement between the holder and the cover

on june_28,_2006 the district_court denied limiteds motion for summary_judgment of anticipation because a genuine_issue of material_fact existed regarding whether a cover was inherently disclosed in the prior_art specifically in u.s._patent 6,398,544` wright'
the court also denied limiteds motion for summary_judgment of obviousness
the court found that limited had proven that` all of the elements of claims 1_and_5 in the ¡¬969 [ p ] atent are found in the prior_art' encompassed by wright and u.s._patent 3,285,694` marchi'
infringement_opinion no._05-_cv-3684 slip op.at 11
however the court rejected limiteds argument-that the motivation to combine was` self-evident' because` the prior_art seeks to solve the same problem' of scorching caused by the candle_holder-as failing to provide clear and convincing evidence of a motivation to combine the prior_art
id.at 11-12
the court stated that limited had` simply supplied prior_art containing the elements of claims 1_and_5 of the ¡¬969 [ p ] atent and used conclusory_statements in lieu of an explanation of the motivation to combine the sources they have alleged'
id.at 12

in the same decision the district_court granted bascs motion for summary_judgment of infringement
the court stated that the language of claims 1_and_5 supported a finding that the candle_tin need only have` a cover that is simply capable of being placed over the open_end of the candle_holder and also used as a base for the holder rather than at all times being placed in those positions'
id.at 17

two days later on june_30,_2006 the district_court issued a sua_sponte_order declaring that the ¡¬969_patent was` valid' as a matter of law` based upon the reasons stated' for denying limiteds summary_judgment_motion of invalidity in the infringement_opinion
validity_motion no._05-_cv-3684 slip op.at 1 2006_wl_6178978
the court found that` no reasonable_trier of fact could find other than that the plaintiffs patent is valid'
id

on august 16 2006 the district_court denied a motion by limited for leave to file a supplemental motion for summary_judgment of indefiniteness
after both parties submitted summary_judgment briefing on damages the court denied the motions
on june_22,_2007 after receiving briefing on the impact of the supreme_courts decision in ksr international co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007) on the prior ruling of patent_validity the district_court *989 reaffirmed its earlier determination that limited had failed to provide an adequate motivation to combine the prior_art
in its docket entry the court quoted ksr as stating that the analysis of a motivation to combine` should be made explicit'

june_22,_2007 document 191` ksr_analysis_order` quoting ksr 127 s.ct.at 1741
because the district_court had based its rejection of limiteds obviousness argument in the infringement_opinion on a finding that limited used` conclusory_statements' the court reaffirmed its determination that` no reasonable_trier of fact could find other than' that the ¡¬969_patent was` valid'
id

on september 4 2007 the district_court granted bascs motion for summary_judgment on damages and determined also on summary_judgment that limited had willfully infringed the ¡¬969_patent
the court awarded basc a reasonable royalty and enhanced damages
on march_27,_2008 the court denied limiteds motion for reconsideration in its entirety by again concluding inter alia that the courts previous finding of patent_validity was a proper application of the clear and convincing standard and consistent with ksr
the court also found that its finding of willful infringement was consistent with in re seagate techology llc 497_f.3d_1360_(fed.cir.2007)

on april_23,_2008 limited timely appealed the district_courts claim_construction and grants of summary_judgment on the issues of patent_validity infringement and damages

discussion
a. validity
1
claim construction
as a preliminary matter we first determine whether the district_court properly construed the term` to seat' to mean` to either rest on or fit into the cover' thus not requiring any engagement between the candle_holder and the cover
claim_construction_opinion 2006_wl_1049581 at *2
we review claim_construction de novo
phillips v. awh corp. 415_f.3d_1303 1328 fed.cir.2005 en banc

limited argues that the district_courts construction is inconsistent with the text context and history of claims 1_and_5
limited asserts that every figure in the ¡¬969_patent shows an engagement between the candle_holder and the cover
in response basc states that the ordinary and customary meaning of` to seat' is` to rest on'
basc contends that there was no clear disavowal in the ¡¬969_patent or its prosecution_history of the embodiment shown in figure 1c which shows the feet merely resting upon the cover
basc also argues that the principle of claim differentiation dictates the construction given by the district_court because claim 2 which is dependent on claim 1 expressly requires engagement with the cover

we agree with basc that the district_court did not err in construing the term` to seat' as not requiring an engagement between the feet and the cover
the relevant portions of claims 1_and_5 are identical` protrusions formed on the closed_end of the holder and extending therefrom the protrusions resting upon the closed_end of the cover to seat the holder on the cover'
¡¬969_patent_col.5 ll.54-56 ; id
col.6 ll.27-30
this language makes clear that the protrusions or feet are what cause the candle_holder to be` seat [ ed ]' on the cover
thus limiteds argument that every figure in the ¡¬969_patent shows an engagement between the candle_holder and the cover misses the point because even if engagement were required the claim_language *990 dictates that the engagement would be between the feet and the cover
similarly limiteds argument regarding the prosecution_history of the ¡¬969_patent is unpersuasive
the language regarding the protrusions was added to claims 1_and_5 to overcome a rejection based on prior_art that depicted a candle_holder that could lock together with its cover when the cover was used as a base
nothing in the language added concerning the protrusions indicates that basc intended the feet to lock into the cover ; rather the language indicates an intent to distinguish bascs claimed invention from the prior_art by the presence of feet on the bottom of the candle_holder

furthermore` claims must be read in view of the specification of which they are a part'
phillips 415 f.3d at 1315 internal quotation marks and citation omitted
figure 1 c clearly depicts the feet merely resting atop the cover in contrast to figure 5b which depicts the feet locking into recesses in the cover
in addition claim 2 specifically requires some engagement between the feet and a recess in the cover
see ¡¬969_patent_col.5 l.57-col.6 l.2` the candle_tin of claim 1 in which the closed_end of the cover has a recess formed therein for seating the protrusions there being a gap formed between the cover and holder when the holder is seated on the cover`
thus because the specification illustrates feet both resting on the cover and locking into recesses in the cover and also in light of the prosecution_history we conclude that the correct construction of the term` to seat' does not require an engagement between the feet and the cover

2
obviousness
on appeal limited argues that the district_court erred in declaring sua sponte that the ¡¬969_patent was` valid'
limited claims that basc never moved for a determination of validity nor did the court put limited on notice that the patent might be declared` valid' without trial
as a result limited argues the court precluded limited from presenting its pled defense of indefiniteness and having factual questions of inherency relating to its anticipation defense decided by a jury

substantively limited asserts that claims 1_and_5 of the ¡¬969_patent would have been obvious under ksr
limited states that all the claim limitations of claims 1_and_5 and information as to how to configure these elements are in the prior_art
limited argues that the ¡¬969_patent would have been obvious to a person of ordinary_skill in the art attempting to address the problem of scorching
thus limited contends that under the reasoning of ksr with respect to any motivation to combine the district_court erred as a matter of law in failing to find claims 1_and_5 of the ¡¬969_patent obvious

basc responds that granting summary_judgment sua sponte is within the district_courts discretion and that the court recognized that basc had simply overlooked formally moving for a validity determination
basc argues that limited was on notice and had an opportunity to respond regarding the issue of validity because its summary_judgment_motion for a declaration of invalidity was under consideration
furthermore basc asserts that even if notice had been lacking limited suffered no prejudice because it failed to present any additional evidence of a viable claim for invalidity
basc also states that the court properly exercised its discretion in determining that limited had waived its indefiniteness defense because of evasive and untimely filings and notes that limited had argued that there was no genuine_issue of material_fact including any relating *991 to inherency in its failed summary_judgment_motion on anticipation

with respect to obviousness basc argues that the district_court applied ksr correctly
basc asserts that the cited references provided other solutions for the scorching problem and thus taught away from combining references in the manner described in the ¡¬969_patent
basc further contends that the commercial_success of its candle_tin and the fact that no prior_art contained the claimed limitations for the required shapes and configuration of the candle_tin further support a finding of nonobviousness

obviousness under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 is a question of law with underlying factual considerations regarding 1 the scope and content of the prior_art 2 the differences between the prior_art and the claimed invention 3 the level of ordinary_skill in the art and 4 any relevant secondary considerations
graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 17-18 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966)
a claimed invention is invalid for obviousness` if the differences between the subject_matter sought to be patented and the prior_art are such that the subject_matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary_skill in the art to which said subject_matter pertains'
35 u.s.c.¡± 103 2000

we agree with limited that claims 1_and_5 of the ¡¬969_patent are invalid for obviousness based on wright and marchi
* because we conclude that the district_court erred substantively in failing to grant summary_judgment on this basis we do not address the procedural propriety of the district_courts sua_sponte_order

the disagreement between the parties-and the sole basis for the district_courts denial of limiteds motion for summary_judgment of obviousness-is whether a motivation to combine the prior_art existed
we think there clearly was such a motivation
as explained in ksr` [ w ] hen there is a design need or market pressure to solve a problem and there are a finite number of identified predictable solutions a person of ordinary_skill has good reason to pursue the known options within his or her technical grasp
if this leads to the anticipated success it is likely the product not of innovation but of ordinary_skill and common_sense'
127 s.ct.at 1742
the court stated that if a combination of known elements was` obvious to try' to address a recognized problem the combination may have been obvious under ¡± 103
id

here it is undisputed that the prior_art discloses all the limitations of the claims
most relevant to our analysis the wright patent discloses` protuberances' or` bumps' on the bottom of a candle can *992 wright col.3 ll.35-36 and the marchi patent discloses a combination cover-stand and includes a figure showing the invention configured with the candle_holder resting on top of the stand

?
marchi figs.1 & 2
it is also undisputed that the problem of scorching caused by the bottoms of hot candle_holders was known and had been addressed by others by the time kholsa began to work on the ¡¬969_patent
see e.g. wright col.1 ll.41-48` the downside of using metal cans to accommodate burning candles is well known and derives from the fact that the thermally conductive nature of metal frequently allows transmission of harmful quantities of heat from not only the flame but from the heated and liquefied candle wax which heat passes through the can base to a support surface which may be damaged by the heat
`` ; marchi col.1 ll.39-43 when` the candle burns near the bottom of the vessel the vessel walls grow hot and there is a danger of the heat scorching or marring wood or painted surfaces on which the vessel may have been set`
finally basc did not dispute the district_courts adoption of limiteds argument that because the` technology is simple and easily understandable' the level of ordinary_skill in the art was that of an ordinary layman of average intelligence
infringement_opinion no._05-_cv-3684 slip op.at 10 citing union carbide corp. v. am
can co. 724_f.2d_1567 1573 fed.cir.1984

the supreme_court in ksr stated that` [ i ] f a person of ordinary_skill can implement a predictable_variation ¡± 103 likely bars its patentability'
127 s.ct.at 1740
that is clearly the situation here
the *993 combination of putting feet on the bottom of the candle_holder and using the cover as a base for the candle_holder was a predictable_variation
both marchi and wright involve raising the bottom of a candle_holder away from the supporting surface to avoid or minimize scorching
in fact the parties agreed that marchi discloses a candle container with a cover that was designed to be used as a base to prevent heat damage from the candle_holder when the candle is lit
similarly wright discloses` bumps that further space the candle can from the surface that supports the candle can' and` diminish the area of contact'
wright col.3 ll.36-37 ; id
col.5 l.15
the combination of a cover-stand and feet on the bottom of the candle_holder was obvious to try in an effort to minimize scorching as the combination would further raise the bottom of the candle_holder above the supporting surface
the resulting and desired decreased heat transfer between the candle_holder and the supporting surface from the combination would have been entirely predictable and grounded in common_sense

in addition the district_court erred in finding a requirement in ksr of an explicit motivation to combine
the court faulted limited for using what the court deemed` conclusory_statements in lieu of an explanation of a motivation to combine'
ksr_analysis_order no._205-cv-3684 slip op.at 2 quoting the infringement_opinion
although the court quoted ksr at length it misconstrued the language that the motivation to combine analysis` should be made explicit'
id.at 1-2
a broader look at this portion of ksr sheds light on the proper inquiry often it will be necessary for a court to look to interrelated teachings of multiple patents ; the effects of demands known to the design community or present in the marketplace ; and the background knowledge possessed by a person having ordinary_skill in the art all in order to determine whether there was an apparent reason to combine the known elements in the fashion claimed by the patent at issue
to facilitate review this analysis should be made explicit
see in re kahn 441_f.3d_977 988 c.a.fed.2006` [ r ] ejections on obviousness grounds can not be sustained by mere conclusory_statements ; instead there must be some articulated reasoning with some rational underpinning to support the legal conclusion of obviousness'
as our precedents make clear however the analysis need not seek out precise teachings directed to the specific subject_matter of the challenged claim for a court can take account of the inferences and creative_steps that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would employ
127 s.ct.at 1740-41 emphases added
thus the analysis that` should be made explicit' refers not to the teachings in the prior_art of a motivation to combine but to the courts analysis
here all the limitations of claims 1_and_5 of the ¡¬969_patent were in the prior_art as was the claimed configuration and a known problem of scorching
ksr thus compels the grant of summary_judgment of obviousness
127 s.ct.at 1745-46` where as here the content of the prior_art the scope of the patent claim and the level of ordinary_skill in the art are not in material dispute and the obviousness of the claim is apparent in light of these factors summary_judgment is appropriate`
under the flexible inquiry set forth by the supreme_court the district_court therefore erred by failing to take account of` the inferences and creative_steps' or even routine steps that an inventor would employ and by failing to find a motivation to combine related pieces from the prior_art

*994 finally basc asserts that the secondary consideration of commercial_success supports the district_courts conclusion of nonobviousness
we disagree
the minimal_indications of commercial_success argued by basc do not outweigh the clear_indication of obviousness apparent from the prior_art
see leapfrog enters. inc. v. fisher-price inc. 485_f.3d_1157 1162 fed.cir.2007

because basc alleged infringement of only_claims 1_and_5 those are the only_claims in issue and we render no judgment on any other claims
to the extent that the district_court declared the patent` valid' or all the claims of the patent` valid' we vacate that declaration
aside from the fact that courts do not declare patents to be valid and only declare that they have not been proved to be invalid if such is the case courts should not adjudicate claims not put in issue by the parties unless a holding with respect to contested claims necessarily implicates others a situation that has not been argued to be the case here

we therefore reverse the district_courts denial of limiteds motion for summary_judgment of invalidity of claims 1_and_5 for obviousness and thus vacate the courts subsequent holding that the ¡¬969_patent was` valid' as a matter of law
we remand to the court with instructions to grant summary_judgment invalidating claims 1_and_5 of the ¡¬969_patent for obviousness

motion to strike

on november 14 2008 basc moved to strike portions of limiteds reply_brief filed in this court
because we do not rely upon the arguments made by limited in that section of its reply_brief bascs motion is denied as moot

b
infringement
we next turn to the district_courts grant of summary_judgment of infringement
the district_court found infringement because the accused travel_candle` is reasonably capable of being configured in such a way that its holder is supported by the cover when the cover is placed open_end down on a surface'
infringement_opinion no._05-_cv-3684 slip op.at 19
on appeal limited argues that the court erred in reading the claims to cover any product` reasonably capable' of being configured in the same manner
limited asserts that because claims 1_and_5 only read on a candle_tin actually placed in the claimed configuration and because there is no evidence of the travel_candle ever being so configured limited is entitled to a summary_judgment of noninfringement
in response basc argues that claims 1_and_5 are apparatus not method claims
basc contends that an apparatus patent claim with functional elements is infringed if the accused product is reasonably capable of being used without substantial modification in the manner recited in the claim

we agree with limited that the district_court erred in granting summary_judgment of infringement of claims 1_and_5
the claim_language clearly specifies a particular configuration in which the protrusions must be` resting upon' the cover
¡¬969_patent_col.5 l.55 ; id
col.6 l.29
thus bascs reliance on cases that found infringement by accused products that were reasonably capable of operating in an infringing manner is misplaced since that line of cases is relevant only to claim_language that specifies that the claim is drawn to capability
see fantasy sports props. inc. v. sportsline.com inc. 287_f.3d_1108 1117-18 fed.cir.2002 clarifying that infringement is not proven per se by a finding that an accused product is merely capable of infringing because` in *995 every infringement analysis the language of the claims as well as the nature of the accused product dictates whether an infringement has occurred'
here the language of claims 1_and_5 of the ¡¬969_patent specifies that infringement occurs only if the accused product is configured with the cover being used as a base underneath a candle_holder with feet
that the travel_candle was reasonably capable of being put into the claimed configuration is insufficient for a finding of infringement
see acco brands inc. v. aba locks mfr co. 501_f.3d_1307 1313 fed.cir.2007 rejecting a` reasonably capable' standard for direct_infringement
rather infringement requires` specific instances of direct_infringement or that the accused device necessarily infringes the patent in suit'
id
basc concedes that it has no proof that the travel_candle was ever placed in the infringing configuration and it is clear that the travel_candle does not necessarily have to be placed in the infringing configuration
we thus reverse the district_courts finding of infringement and we remand to the court with instructions to issue a summary_judgment of noninfringement

because we reverse the district_court on the issues of patent_validity and infringement the parties remaining arguments need not be considered
in addition we necessarily vacate the holdings on damages and willfulness

conclusion
for the foregoing reasons we reverse the judgment of the district_court and remand to the court with instructions to grant summary_judgment that claims 1_and_5 are invalid and not infringed

reversed vacated and remanded
