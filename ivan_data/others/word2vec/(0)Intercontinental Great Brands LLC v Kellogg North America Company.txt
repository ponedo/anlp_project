kraft foods global brands llc now called intercontinental great brands owns u.s. patent no._6918,532 which issued in 2005 and was supplemented with additional claims on reexamination in 2011
the532_patent describes and claims a food package that after opening can be resealed to maintain the freshness of the food_items inside
kraft brought this patent-infringement suit against kellogg north america co. keebler foods co. and affiliates collectively kellogg in the northern_district of illinois
the district_court held that kellogg was entitled to summary_judgment of invalidity for obviousness of the asserted claims of the532_patent
intercontinental_great_brands_llc v. kellogg n. am co. 118_f.supp.3d_1022 1027-42 n.d. ill. 2015
the court also held that kraft was entitled to summary_judgment rejecting kelloggs counterclaim of unenforceability of the patent due to alleged_inequitable_conduct by kraft chiefly in an ex parte reexamination proceeding
id.at 1044-45

i
the532_patent describes a combination of two known kinds of packaging
one common for cookies uses a frame surrounded by a wrapper
the other common for wet_wipes uses a package on which the label may be pulled back to access the contents then put back in place to reseal the package to preserve the items remaining inside

thus the background section of the patent begins` containers for food_products such as cookies and other snacks typically include a frame surrounded by an outer wrapper
the frame acts as a tray to hold the food_product and to protect the food_product from damage'
'532_patent col. 1 lines 12-15
a person wanting to consume some but not all of the items in the package` normally' does so` by opening one end of the wrapper withdrawing the tray from the inside thereof and then removing the food_product from the tray'
id. col. 1 lines 15-18
`` [ t ] hese containers' however` generally do not provide a convenient_opening and reclosing arrangement
for example reclosing of the wrapper once opened generally includes simply folding or rolling the end down and clip-ping the end to keep the wrapper closed'
id. col. 1 lines 19-23

at the same time` [ r ] eclosable seals have been used for dispensing bags for wet tissue or disposable cleaning wipes'
id. col. 1 lines 24-25
`` the label on these bags can be pulled back thereby exposing an opening allowing access to the wet_tissues or wipes inside'
id. col. 1 lines 25-27
`` typically' however` these dispensing bags' lack a rigid internal structure i.e.` are completely flexible formed exclusively of a plastic or other suitable flexible material which closely surrounds the pack of wet_tissues or wipes'
id. col. 1 lines 27-30
lacking an internal rigid structure` such known dispensing bags are not well suited for containing food_products as *1340 these containers fail to provide adequate_protection for storing food_products'
id. col. 1 lines 34-36

the patent then introduces the invention the purpose of the present invention is to provide a new and improved container for food_products such as rigid food articles for example cookies and the like which container provides adequate_protection for the contents thereof while concurrently facilitating opening of the container wrapper and resealing the seal to protect the contents thereof until the contents are fully consumed
id. col. 1 lines 39-46

claim 1 which is largely representative for purposes of this appeal recites as follows 1
a polygonal shaped food container comprising a frame defining the polygonal shape of the container said container having a top a bottom [ ] and sides connecting the top and bottom the frame containing a food_product comprised of discrete_food_articles ; a wrapper surrounding said frame said wrapper forming the top [ ] sides [ ] and bottom of the container ; said top having an access_opening sufficiently large to provide hand_access to substantially all of the discrete_food_articles contained within the frame such that substantially any one of the discrete_food_articles can be accessed and removed individually through said access_opening ; and
a sealing_layer adhesively sealed to said top around said opening said sealing_layer including a starter_portion located near a side of the top which can be grasped by a user said sealing_layer being releasable when said starter_portion is pulled in a direction away from said side to in turn pull and thereby release at least a portion of said sealing_layer to provide the hand_access to said top access_opening and reclosable against said top to seal said opening when said sealing_layer is moved back against the said top
id. col. 5 lines 29-51

in october 2007 about two years after the532_patent issued a swedish company that produces resealable packages sought an ex parte reexamination of that patent from the u.s. patent and trademark_office
intercontinental 118 f.supp.3d at 1026
the office initiated the reexamination and in april 2010 the examiner in the central reexamination unit rejected all claims except two of the claims that kraft added to which the examiner objected relying centrally on a short 2001 article in packaging_news that displayed and described re-seal it packaging made by a swedish firm and marketed by paramount_packaging
in august 2011 however the patent_trial and appeal_board reversed all of the rejections
it relied critically on a particular phrase in the packaging_news_article asserting the conventionality of the wrapping_film to distinguish the kraft patent claims-a phrase that does not appear in the descriptions of paramount re-seal it packaging in the distinct prior-art articles that became central in the present litigation
ex parte kraft foods global brands llc. no._2011-005770 2011_wl_3754634_(p.t.a.b._aug._19,_2011)
the resulting reexamination certificate contained the original claims 1-25 and new claims 26-67

in 2013 kraft sued kellogg for infringement of a number of claims of the532_patent
in particular kraft alleged that kellogg infringed by making using selling and offering certain resealable cookie_packages that a kellogg document suggested were designed to`circumvent [ ] the kraft patent while maintaining similar properties
`` intercontinental 118 f.supp.3d at 1026 alteration in original
*1341 kellogg responded by alleging among other things that the asserted claims of the532_patent were invalid for obviousness and that the patent was unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct by kraft before the board in securing reversal of the examiners rejections during reexamination
kellogg eventually moved for summary_judgment of invalidity and kraft moved for summary_judgment on kelloggs counterclaim of unenforceability due to inequitable_conduct.1

the district_court granted kelloggs motion for summary_judgment of invalidity of all of the asserted claims 1 3 4 6 26 32 33 34 35 36 37 39 and 42 under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 20062 as the patent itself makes clear the` frame' element is shown by prior_art such as u.s. patent no._3740,238 issued to graham which discloses a traditional_cookie_package with a frame to hold the cookies described as prior_art in the532_patent
and while the patent makes clear that non-food prior_art showed a peel-back_resealable_package without a rigid structure packaging for wet_wipes what the patent does not show but the record in this litigation reveals is prior_art showing a peel-back_resealable_package with a rigid_tray for food_items` such as' discrete_items like sushi and canapes -namely two related articles in the machinery_update publication describing and showing a re-seal it package marketed in britain by paramount_packaging as an agent for real-seal it sweden
see machinery_update march/april 2002_at_59 -60 j.a
4423-24 ; machinery_update september/october 2001_at_46 -47 j.a
4708-09

first considering independent_claims 1_and_34 the district_court concluded that the record put beyond reasonable dispute that all claim elements except the` frame' element were shown in the machinery_update_articles and the` frame' element was shown in the prior_art of cookie_packaging such as the graham patent
intercontinental 118 f.supp.3d at 1030-34
the court then determined that the only reasonable_inference on the record was that a relevant_skilled_artisan would have been motivated to combine those prior-art_references
the court specifically stressed that the absence of a` convenient_opening and reclosing arrangement' was a` known problem' for cookie_packaging and that the machinery_update resealable tray-included packaging for foods offered a skilled_artisan a solution to the problem simply by replacing the machinery_update` tray' with a frame i.e. a tray with higher sides
more generally the court considered the simple and clear teachings of the art the importance of common_sense and ordinary_creativity and the conclusory character of krafts experts assertions of nonobviousness
id.at 1034-38
the court next analyzed the various dependent_claims finding no basis for a different_conclusion about the art-based portion of the obviousness_analysis
id.at 1038-41

finally the court concluded that krafts evidence of certain objective_indicia though substantial was simply not entitled to such weight in the ultimate legal assessment *1342 of obviousness as to produce a bottom-line conclusion of anything but invalidity
id.at 1041-42
in particular the court determined that kraft had strong evidence of commercial_success tied to the patent-claimed packaging industry_praise and copying by kellogg
id.at 1041
nevertheless the court concluded` this is a case in which the secondary_considerations do not overcome kelloggs extremely strong_prima_facie_showing that the invention was obvious in light of machinery_update'
id
the court explained in this case the prior_art_references teach all of the claim limitations-all of the elements could be found in existing food_packaging_technology
in fact nearly all of the elements were found in one machinery_update_article and the rest already existed in cookie_packages
additionally the technology is relatively simple
based on these considerations a person skilled in the art would have a reason to combine the elements to create the invention
in sum the primary considerations lead to a conclusion that the invention was obvious in light of the prior_art and [ intercontinentals ] strong showing of secondary_considerations does not outweigh this determination
in sum based on the undisputed facts all of the asserted claims are invalid as obvious in light of machinery_update when combined with existing cookie_packages
id.at 1042

with regard to kelloggs unenforceability challenge to the532_patent based chiefly on alleged_inequitable_conduct by kraft in the reexamination proceeding the court granted krafts motion for summary_judgment rejecting the challenge
id.at 1044-45
the court explained that the charge of inequitable_conduct during reexamination did not and could not rest on withholding by kraft of material prior_art ; in particular` [ i ] t is undisputed that [ the 2002 ] machinery_update [ article ].. [ was ] presented during reexamination'
id.at 1044
the court then addressed kelloggs key charge-that krafts counsel did not tell the patent and trademark_office pto that the phrase in the packaging_news_article about the conventionality of the wrapping_film on which the board came to rely in upholding krafts claims was actually a misprint as allegedly made evident by the opposite characterization of the film used in re-seal it packaging in the 2002 machinery_update_article
the district_court while agreeing that the phrase in packaging_news likely was a misprint concluded that krafts counsel` merely restated the contents of the misprinted article' and` [ t ] here is no evidence that the attorney knowingly failed to identify the inconsistency between the two articles'
intercontinental 118 f.supp.3d at 1045

`` in ksr the supreme_court criticized a rigid approach to determining obviousness based on the disclosures of individual prior-art_references with little recourse to the knowledge creativity and common_sense that an ordinarily skilled_artisan would have brought to bear when considering combinations or modifications'
randall 733 f.3d at 1362
`` [ t ] he court required an analysis that reads the prior_art in context taking account ofdemands known to the design communitythe background_knowledge possessed by a person having ordinary_skill in the art andthe inferences and creative steps that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would employ
`` id
( quoting ksr 550 u.s. at 418 127_s.ct._1727
a` court must ask whether the [ claimed ] improvement is more than the predictable_use' -a` predictable variation' -' of prior_art_elements according to their established functions' considering whether more is involved than` the simple substitution of one known element for another or the mere application of a known technique to a piece of prior_art ready for the improvement'

`` [ i ] f a technique has been used to improve one device and a person of ordinary_skill in the art would recognize that it would improve similar devices in the same way using the technique is obvious unless its actual application is beyond his or her skill'
id.at 417 127_s.ct._1727
the court should consider a range of real-world facts to determine` whether there was an apparent reason to combine the known elements in the fashion claimed by the patent at issue'
id.at 418 127_s.ct._1727 ; see id
(` [ i ] t can be important to identify a reason that would have prompted a person of ordinary_skill in the relevant field to combine the elements in the way the claimed new invention does`
`` one of the ways in which a patents subject_matter can be proved obvious is by noting that there existed at the time of invention a known problem for which there was an obvious solution encompassed by the patents claims'
id.at 419-20 127_s.ct._1727

depending on the record summary_judgment of invalidity for obviousness may be appropriate
the supreme_court ordered summary_judgment in ksr after a careful determination of the facts put beyond genuine_dispute by the record and it explained that` a conclusory affidavit addressing the question of obviousness' does not` exclude the possibility of summary_judgment'
id.at 426 127_s.ct._1727
rather in considering summary_judgment on that question the district_court can and should take into account expert_testimony which may resolve or keep open certain questions of fact
that is not the end of the issue however
the ultimate judgment of obviousness is a legal_determination
graham 383 u.s. at 17 [ 86_s.ct._684 ]
where as here the content of the prior_art the scope of the patent claim and the level of ordinary_skill in the art are not in material dispute and the obviousness of the claim is apparent in light of these factors summary_judgment is appropriate
id.at 427 127_s.ct._1727
based on the required close examinations of case-specific records this court since ksr has sometimes held summary_judgment of obviousness unwarranted5 and sometimes *1345 held it warranted.6

in this case we conclude the district_court correctly determined that summary_judgment was warranted on the record for the reasons we have summarized in describing the district_courts opinion
krafts arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive

1
kraft turns first to the objective_indicia secondary_considerations bearing on obviousness
krafts opening_br
38-42
it contends that the district_court treated the objective_indicia as an` afterthought'` writing off the patent before turning to objective_indicia' and` repeatedly not [ ing ] its finding of obviousness before considering the objective_indicia'
id.at 38 40 41
that contention mischaracterizes the district_courts reasoning which followed a sequence that accords with ksr graham and this courts precedents

the district_court drew its conclusion of obviousness only after not before considering the objective_indicia
intercontinental 118 f.supp.3d at 1042
before reviewing the objective_indicia the court concluded only that kellogg had made a` strong_prima_facie_showing of obviousness'
intercontinental 118 f.supp.3d at 1037-38` because there is no genuine_dispute that all elements of claims 1_and_34 are disclosed in the prior_art and it would have been predictable for a person of skill in the art to combine those elements kellogg has made a strong_prima_facie_showing of obviousness as to independent_claims 1_and_34
`` ; see id.at 1038-41 same for asserted dependent_claims
as its opinion shows id.at 1034-37 the court drew that conclusion based on the graham_factors directed to identifying the teachings of the prior_art as well as the considerations this court has identified as bearing on the question of motivation to combine
see e.g. plantronics 724 f.3d at 1354` [ m ] otivation to combine may be found explicitly or implicitly in market forces ; design incentives ; theinterrelated teachings of multiple patents ;any need or problem known in the field of endeavor at the time of invention and addressed by the patent ; and the background_knowledge creativity and common_sense of the person of ordinary_skill'
( citing perfect_web 587 f.3d at 1328-29 quoting ksr 550 u.s. at 418-21 127_s.ct._1727

the court thus did not draw an ultimate_conclusion regarding obviousness before considering the objective_indicia
the contrary is not shown by the courts not-uncommon_choice of words when conducting the ultimate weighing namely that the objective_indicia` do not overcome kelloggs extremely strong_prima_facie_showing'
*1346 intercontinental 118 f.supp.3d at 1041
see e.g. ohio_willow 735 f.3d at 1344 similar usage ; perfect_web 587 f.3d at 1333 similar ; cf
ksr 550 u.s. at 426 127_s.ct._1727 secondary_considerations do not` dislodge' the determination that the claim would have been obvious

while withholding a conclusion as to obviousness until considering the objective_indicia the district_court did draw the following conclusions before such consideration` there was a known problem in the cookie_packaging industry and all of the elements of the invention existed in the prior_art' ;` [ a ] packaging_expert with knowledge of existing food_packaging_technology would have thought to combine a resealable container and a frame big enough to contain cookies' ; and the claimed` combinationwould have been entirely predictable and grounded in common_sense
`` intercontinental 118 f.supp.3d at 1035 quoting ball_aerosol & specialty_container 555 f.3d at 992-93
the court then concluded before discussing objective_indicia` no reasonable_jury could conclude that a person skilled in packaging design would not be motivated to combine these features'
id

kraft contends that objective_indicia must be evaluated before drawing a conclusion about whether a reasonable_jury could find that a relevant_skilled_artisan had a motivation to combine the prior_art not merely before drawing the ultimate obviousness conclusion
but it cites no precedent so holding

kraft does cite authorities confirming that in some cases objective_indicia can be important_evidence of obviousness sometimes even the most important_evidence
see e.g. plantronics 724 f.3d at 1355 ; crocs inc. v. int l trade comm n 598_f.3d_1294 1310 fed
cir
2010
and it cites authorities that say consistent with ksr and graham that objective_indicia must be considered and given` fair weight' before a legal_conclusion on obviousness is drawn

but the district_court here did just that
and kraft cites no authority that requires consideration of objective_indicia as part of the motivation-to-combine factual_analysis

the staged consideration undertaken by the district_court and reflected in our cases makes sense within the motivation-to-combine framework a framework with which kraft does not take issue
when a challenger shows that a` motivation' existed for a relevant_skilled_artisan to combine prior_art in the way claimed in the patent at issue such a showing commonly supports and leads readily to the further ultimate determination that such an artisan using ordinary_creativity would actually have found the claimed invention obvious
but the latter conclusion does not follow automatically from the former finding and additional evidence may prevent drawing it
identification of a` motivation' to make the combination may not give a complete picture of what a skilled_artisan exercising ordinary_creativity without the incentive of patent protection would actually have found it obvious to` disclose [ ] or devise [ ]' at the relevant time
see graham 383 u.s. at 11 86_s.ct._684 explaining that when congress *1347 adopted ¡± 103 and even before` [ t ] he inherent problem was to develop some means of weeding out those inventions which would not be disclosed or devised but for the inducement of a patent'
even with a motivation proved the record may reveal reasons that after all the court should not conclude that the combination would have been obvious i.e. already part of the public domain.7 one type of such additional evidence consists of evidence of objective_indicia-commercial_success traceable to the claimed invention industry_praise copying and certain other facts concerning peoples actions and statements

this way of structuring the analysis implements the requirement that the approach to determining obviousness be` expansive' and` flexible'
see ksr 550 u.s. at 415 127_s.ct._1727
it reflects an understanding of the role of` motivation' that fits our consistent treatment of that element of the analysis as factual in nature
and it fits the supreme_courts treatment of objective_indicia as evidence to be weighed in the overall legal_determination of obviousness
we see no error in the sequence of steps the district_court took in arriving at its ultimate obviousness_determination

krafts only argument about the objective_indicia thus fails
kraft can not complain that the district_court failed to credit its evidence regarding objective_indicia the district_court accepted the facts kraft asserted about commercial_success industry_praise and copying
what remains for the objective_indicia therefore is a weighing to produce a legal_conclusion
but kraft does not additionally argue to us certainly not in a meaningful way that in this particular_case the objective_indicia accepted by the district_court require a legal_conclusion of nonobviousness if we agree with the district_court as to the prior-art and motivation-to-combine elements of the analysis
any implicit undeveloped suggestion to that effect by kraft is not enough on the record here given the strength of the record on those elements including the simplicity of the technology and combination at issue the recognized problem of resealing for cookie_packaging and the strong teaching of the prior_art just before the claimed priority_date
see e.g. ohio_willow 735 f.3d at 1344` [ w ] here a claimed invention represents no more than the predictable_use of prior_art_elements according to established functions as here evidence of secondary indicia are frequently deemed inadequate to establish nonobviousness
``

2
kraft next argues that the district_court improperly resolved genuine factual disputes
the district_court concluded that the following were the only reasonable findings on the record the machinery_update_articles published shortly before krafts priority_date disclose all the elements of the claims in combination-including notably a pull-back_resealable_package for discrete_food_items with a rigid_tray-except the required` frame' that was common for cookies as shown by graham ; the absence of a satisfactory resealable package was a known problem for cookies ; and the ordinary_creativity of the relevant skilled packaging artisan motivated and made predictable the use of the machinery_update_package with a cookie-protecting frame as a solution to that known problem
kraft has not shown any *1348 basis in the record for reasonable contrary findings
those findings in this case suffice to justify the overall legal_conclusion of obviousness there being no meaningful_argument that the objective_indicia when weighed in krafts favor as the district_court did can change the ultimate_conclusion

kraft argues that the district_court failed to provide` explicit and clear reasoning providing some rational underpinning' for its invocation of common_sense in its motivation-to-combine analysis
krafts opening_br
43 quoting plantronics 724 f.3d at 1354
we disagree
the court relied on the record demonstrating the` known problem' of an insufficiently` convenient_opening and reclosing arrangement' for cookie_packaging and the suggestion in machinery_update itself that its packaging with a tray was usable for a variety of foods` such as' discrete_items like sushi and canapes
intercontinental 118 f.supp.3d at 1035-36

kraft also points to the absence of expert_testimony for kellogg on this point
krafts opening_br
43
but we have recognized that some cases involve technologies and prior_art that are simple enough that no expert_testimony is needed
see wyers 616 f.3d at 1239` ksr and our later cases establish that the legal_determination of obviousness may include recourse to logic judgment and common_sense in lieu of expert_testimony

cir
2008
what is claimed and described in the532_patent -which does not include any new manufacturing equipment or instructions to produce the described and claimed packaging-makes this such a case

kraft next contends that the evidence in the record shows that there was more than one reasonable_inference about whether a relevant_skilled_artisan had a motivation to use the machinery_update_packaging with a frame for cookies
kraft begins by relying on the assertion that` kellogg personnel rejected the idea of combining a traditional_cookie_package with the resealable technology' of the machinery_update_articles
krafts opening_br
45
but the record does not support the suggested inference
at best the cited deposition testimony could establish that a group of kellogg employees viewed a sample of the re-seal it packaging technology at an internal meeting along with other packaging samples brought back from a trade show and kellogg did not immediately adopt the technology for cookies
see j.a
6328-29 6347 6366-69
but the only evidence in the record about the reason behind that initial decision is that kellogg did not possess the required equipment and did not then wish to purchase new equipment
j.a
6329
one companys temporary decision about an equipment investment is not sufficient to defeat the otherwise-compelled inference that combining the re-seal it packaging with familiar cookie-package frames as in graham was a predictable technological solution to the relevant known market problem

kraft does not dispute as its own evidence recited by the district_court confirms that the invention disclosed in its patent helps solve a known problem with cookie_packaging experienced by those consumers who want the option of eating less than a full package of cookies in one sitting
intercontinental 118 f.supp.3d at 1035
the packaging in the machinery_update_articles with an internal tray to protect the contents and convenient resealing functionality and its suggestion of use for a variety of discrete_food_items makes readily predictable its use for cookies by raising the sides of the tray to form a` frame'
kraft points to statements by its packaging_expert or kraft filings based on *1349 such statements as allegedly supporting a contrary finding
krafts opening_br
46-52 citing portions of j.a
1769-75 6134-35 6146-53 6156 6159-60 6163-64 6166-67
but the experts statements in this case are insufficient to support a reasonable contrary finding

krafts expert especially in the pto devoted relatively little attention to the machinery_update_articles
he focused instead on the packaging_news_article which unlike the machinery_update_articles stated that the re-seal it packaging described and shown did not use conventional wrapping-the statement that led the board on reexamination to reverse the examiners rejection of krafts claims
regardless to the extent that his statements apply directly or indirectly to the machinery_update_packaging they rest on misreadings of the articles and disregard of the plain significance of other evidence from kraft itself

for example the expert suggested that the machinery_update_articles are focused on layered items like sliced meats and suggest use of a tray only to be removed from the side of the package not for items like cookies to be accessed from the top by peeling back the resealable flap
krafts opening_br
46-52
but the district_court correctly explained why the machinery_update_articles do teach top access to trays with unstacked discrete_items giving sushi and canapes as mere examples` such as' as well as parallel perimeter portions at the top for the sealing_layer to stick to
intercontinental 118 f.supp.3d at 1030-34
we fail to see any other reasonable reading of the machinery_update_articles on these points.8

likewise the expert noted` many reclosure variations' as kraft summarizes the point such as` tin ties twist ties adhesive tape for reclosing one end a clip to pinch the end of the package a zipper strip added to the end or side of the package and a pinch seal strip added to an end or side of the package'
kraft_opening_br
47
but as far as the record shows those were among the very alternatives in the prior_art that left consumers with the` known problem' with cookie_packaging that motivated turning to the resealable machinery_update_packaging
such known-to-be-unsatisfactory alternatives provide no basis for questioning the predictability of picking out the machinery_update_packaging as a new solution to the known problem

kraft asserts based on declarations submitted to the pto relied on by its expert in this case that` [ a ] skilled_artisan would not add a reclosure feature to graham because it is designed for one-time use byopening at one of its ends` and` the graham tray is inexpensive andresiliently flexible to conform to the cookies' whereas the packaging_news packaging` is designed for multiple_openings and reclosings' and its` tray is expensivesignificantly more rigid andnot conformable to the food_products
`` krafts opening_br
46
but those assertions provide no *1350 reasonable basis for denying the predictability of using prior-art cookie frames like grahams in the machinery_update_packaging

it was a` known problem' for cookie_consumers that graham-like packages did not satisfactorily provide for the` multiple_openings and closings' that consumers wanted-and that the machinery_update_packaging made more convenient
as kraft says` [ c ] onsumer dissatisfaction with this traditional frame-in-wrapper package was well-known'
id.at 4
that is what motivated looking to the multiple-use machinery_update_packaging
moreover kraft points to no evidence that the graham-like frames would not work with the machinery_update_packaging
nor does the relied-on testimony say anything actually material about cost it does not say that the resulting cookie package would cost cookie_consumers more than the prior-art cookie package or that any increase would be sufficient to deter the combination
the experts only point about cost was that the cookie frame was less expensive than the machinery_update tray
but that point says nothing to the effect that the relevant cookie consumers would face a cost increase were the cookie makers to use the old frame but replace the surrounding wrappers with the machinery_update_package

on this record we conclude there is no basis for overturning the district_courts conclusion that any reasonable_jury would have to find a motivation to combine

3
krafts final argument invokes this courts recognition that a` party challenging validity shoulders an enhanced_burden if the invalidity argument relies on the same prior_art considered during examination'
tokai 632 f.3d at 1367
according to kraft that proposition applies here based on the reexamination in which graham the 2002 machinery_update_article and the packaging_news_article containing the same photograph as appeared in the 2001 machinery_update_article were considered
see kraft_opening_br
56-60
it suffices to say however that in this case the` enhanced_burden' proposition provides no basis for a different result

the` enhanced_burden' point certainly confirms a practical truth about litigation persuading a fact_finder that an expert agency is incorrect on a proposition is likely to be a greater forensic challenge to the advocate than showing the proposition to be incorrect in the absence of a contrary expert-agency determination
see sciele pharma inc. v. lupin ltd. 684_f.3d_1253 1260-61 fed
cir
2012` [ i ] t may be harder to meet the clear and convincing burden when the invalidity contention is based upon the same argument on the same reference that the pto already considered
importantly whether a reference was before the pto goes to the weight of the evidence and the parties are of course free to and generally do make these arguments to the fact_finder`
this court has not however ascribed any larger meaning to the` enhanced_burden' point which the court has explained does not mean that something more than clear and convincing_evidence is required
id
in any event this is not a case in which what the pto concluded makes a difference for at least two reasons

first as the district_court explained the only express analysis of the machinery_update_articles was by the examiner who rejected the claims
the board which upheld the claims did not expressly consider those articles but relied instead on a sentence in packaging_news that does not appear in the machinery_update_articles
intercontinental 118 f.supp.3d at 1028-29
there is no basis for attributing to the *1351 board an implied assessment of the machinery_update_articles
the record before the board indicates that the board simply accepted a premise that those articles were redundant of packaging_news requiring no separate consideration
there is no specific pto determination of nonobviousness based on the particular prior_art now at issue

second in this case we think that the showing of obviousness is sufficiently strong that no pto contrary determination could alter the conclusion about summary_judgment
if the substantive evidentiary and other arguments made by kraft do not create a triable_issue as we and the district_court have concluded neither could a bare assumption otherwise unexplained that the pto reached a different_conclusion based on the prior_art here at issue
for that reason as well we reject krafts final deference-invoking argument against summary_judgment of obviousness

* * *

in tokai this court drew the following conclusion on the record before it in affirming a summary_judgment of obviousness` [ t ] he undisputed facts in this case-including the state of the prior_art the simplicity and availability of the components making up the claimed invention and an explicit need in the prior_art for [ the asserted invention ] -compel a conclusion of obviousness as to the subject_matter of each of the asserted claims'
632 f.3d at 1371
for the reasons we have set forth we agree with the district_court that the same conclusion is warranted in this case

b
in its cross-appeal kellogg argues that the district_court erred when it granted kraft summary_judgment rejecting kelloggs inequitable-conduct charge.9 the only issue here concerns the arguments kraft made about packaging_news to the board during reexamination
we see no reversible_error in the district_courts conclusion that kelloggs evidence was insufficient to permit a finding of the intent required for inequitable_conduct based on krafts reexamination arguments

kelloggs charge rests on a sentence in the packaging_news_article-a short article that was the central focus before the board including during oral argument when the board was specifically looking at and asking about the brief text
the relevant sentence in that article describes the re-seal it packaging as not using` conventional_wrapping_film'
j.a
4713
kellogg says that the sentence is a misprint and that kraft committed inequitable_conduct by not so informing the board

there is no doubt that the packaging material sentence was important to the boards decision the board relied on that sentence to reverse the examiners rejections of krafts claims
but to prevail kellogg had to prove that kraft in what it did not say about the sentence that was the focus of the boards attention had a` specific intent to mislead or deceive the pto'

unlike ohio_willow this is not a case of withholding documents from the pto in ohio_willow documents key to corroboration of inventorship or of making affirmative misrepresentations in ohio_willow about a key participants supposed admission somewhere in the record
the board had the 2002 machinery_update_article in the record but it was not a basis for the examiners rejections on review and so was not the subject of any discussion before the board.10 the alleged wrong moreover is not what kraft affirmatively stated about packaging_news
the only alleged wrong is krafts omission of any statement that the sentence in the packaging_news reference on which the board was directly focusing was actually a misprint
but even if the sentence was a misprint the district_court properly concluded that the record does not support an inference of deceptive_intent under the therasense standard

kellogg presents no admission or anything similar indicating that any relevant kraft officer or representative during the reexamination actually believed the sentence to be a misprint
kellogg asks for an inference as to what kraft had to believe given the disparity of language between the packaging_news_article` without conventional_wrapping_film' j.a
4713 and the 2002 machinery_update_article` with conventional_wrapping_film' j.a
4424 that krafts counsel had read both articles and that a representative of a company selling packaging machines that counts kraft as one of its biggest customers affiliated with the reexamination requester testified that since` we run with conventional film' it was obvious that the packaging_news sentence was a misprint j.a
6427 6441
but without more evidence of krafts belief one reasonable_inference on the record-especially given kelloggs burden of persuasion-is that kraft did not believe that there was a misprint

kelloggs evidence from the deposition of krafts counsel provides no suggestion of any awareness of a misprint
see j.a
6941-45
the same is true as to krafts inventor-appearing also as krafts official company witness under fed
r._civ
p. 30 b 6 -who testified that she did not recognize a misprint in packaging_news at all much less one based on the difference in language between it and the 2002 machinery_update believing that` they were different packaging in different articles' j.a
6388 and that if there had been a misprint it would have been corrected j.a
6382-83
in the reexamination moreover neither the ex parte requester nor the examiner suggested that the packaging_news_article contained a misprint
the absence of such a statement indicates that the alleged misprint was not as obvious as kellogg claims
the rejections that were then appealed did not involve machinery_update which therefore need not have been the subject of reinspection by kraft during the appeal

in these circumstances we think that the district_court properly concluded that the therasense intent standard could not be met

for too long this court has turned a blind eye to what i consider to be a grave concern the application of a prima_facie_test that necessarily achieves a legal_determination of obviousness prior to full and fair consideration of evidence of objective_indicia of non-obviousness.1 there should be no prima_facie rule or test in the obviousness inquiry

because the majority affirms on obviousness it does not address the district_courts finding of no literal_infringement
because i believe the district_court erred on obviousness i would address the infringement issue
the district_court changed its construction of the claim_term` sealing_layer' between its markman_order and summary_judgment_order resulting in a conclusion of non-infringement

section 103 codified what the common law already had required for a century
see hotchkiss v. m. greenwood & co. 52 u.s. 11 how
248 13_l.ed._683_(1850)
a claimed invention is unpatentable` if the differences between the claimed invention and the prior_art are such that the claimed invention as a whole would have been obvious before the effective filing date of the claimed invention to a person having ordinary_skill in the art to which the claimed invention pertains'

the court set forth the framework for determining whether patent claims would have been obvious under ¡± 103 the scope and content of the prior_art are to be determined ; differences between the prior_art and the claims at issue are to be ascertained ; and the level of ordinary_skill in the pertinent_art resolved
against this background the obviousness or nonobviousness of the subject_matter is determined
such secondary_considerations as commercial_success long felt but unsolved_needs failure of others etc. might be utilized to give light to the circumstances surrounding the origin of the subject_matter sought to be patented
as indicia of obviousness or nonobviousness these inquiries may have relevancy
id.at 17-18 86_s.ct._684 citation omitted
the court noted that objective_indicia of non-obviousness are` more susceptible of judicial treatment' than the other` highly technical facts' relevant to an obviousness_analysis
id.at 36 86_s.ct._684
objective_indicia` may lend a helping hand to the judiciary' that` is most ill-fitted to discharge the technological duties cast upon it by patent legislation'
id
objective_indicia the court wrote help guard against hindsight and` the temptation to read into the prior_art the teachings of the invention in issue'
id.3

more recently the supreme_court clarified the obviousness_analysis in ksr international co. v. teleflex_inc. 550_u.s._398 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007)
it explained that trial_courts must consider the four graham_factors to determine whether an asserted claim would have been obvious 1 the scope and content of prior_art ; 2 the differences between the prior_art and asserted claims ; 3 the level of ordinary_skill ; and 4 objective_indicia of non-obviousness
ksr 550 u.s. at 406 127_s.ct._1727 citing graham 383 u.s. at 17-18 86_s.ct._684

it also cautioned factfinders to consider` the distortion caused by hindsight_bias' and` be cautious of arguments reliant upon ex post reasoning'

in ksr however the patentees minimal evidence of objective_indicia did not` dislodge' the obviousness_determination
id.at 426 127_s.ct._1727
thus the supreme_court held that the asserted claim would have been obvious
id.4

to be clear nothing in graham or ksr requires courts to analyze the first three graham_factors first make a prima_facie determination of obviousness and only then examine objective_indicia of non-obviousness
such a prima_facie_framework excludes objective_indicia in the primary *1355 analysis and artificially creates a heightened standard of proof for objective_indicia
i am not aware of any supreme_court authority that endorses-let alone requires-the prima_facie_framework

c. federal circuit precedent
this court explained the basic obviousness_analysis in stratoflex inc. v. aeroquip corp. 713_f.2d_1530_(fed._cir._1983)
in stratoflex the district_court concluded that the claimed inventions were` plainly obvious'
713 f.2d at 1539
as a result it refused to analyze objective_indicia of non-obviousness
id
we held that such an approach was error noting that each graham factor` is but an aid' in determining whether the claimed invention would have been obvious
id.at 1537
and although we discussed objective_indicia after the other three graham_factors we elaborated at length about their importance it is jurisprudentially inappropriate to disregard any relevant evidence on any issue in any case patent cases included
thus evidence rising out of the so-called` secondary_considerations' must always when present be considered en route to a determination of obviousness
indeed evidence of secondary_considerations may often be the most probative and cogent_evidence in the record
it may often establish that an invention appearing to have been obvious in light of the prior_art was not
it is to be considered as part of all the evidence not just when the decisionmaker remains in doubt after reviewing the art
... en route to a conclusion on obviousness a court must not stop until all pieces of evidence on that issue have been fully considered and each has been given its appropriate weight
along the way some pieces will weigh more heavily than others but decision should be held in abeyance and doubt maintained until all the evidence has had its say
id.at 1538-39 citations omitted
in light of the district_courts failure to consider the objective_indicia we did so in the first instance
id.at 1539
giving` full consideration' of objective_indicia such as alleged commercial_success industry_praise and long-felt but unmet_need we concluded that the claims would have been obvious and thus affirmed the district_court under the harmless error rule

more recently we discussed the role of objective_indicia in cyclobenzaprine 676 f.3d at 1063
in that case the district_court engaged in a three-step analysis to determine whether a certain drug extended-delivery method would have been obvious

2012
in the next section with the heading` prima facie case' the district_court determined that` a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have been motivated to take a group of known elements to create an extended release version of cyclobenzaprine and to have a reasonable expectation of success in doing so'
id.at 537
it also concluded that certain properties and delivery methods would have been obvious
id.at 536-37
only later under the heading` secondary considerations' did the court analyze the patentees objective_indicia of non-obviousness
id.at 537
finding that the objective_indicia did not` overcome the prima_facie_case of obviousness' the district_court granted summary_judgment of obviousness
id.at 536

on appeal we reversed the district_courts obviousness_determination
we explained that the purpose of objective_indicia of non-obviousness is to refute the evidence of obviousness
cyclobenzaprine 676 f.3d at 1077
that a patent_owner may submit this evidence on objective_indicia *1356 does not mean however that the burden shifts to the patent_owner to prove non-obviousness

although this court highlighted the dangers associated with the prima_facie_framework in cyclobenzaprine we have not diligently instructed trial_courts to abandon the framework altogether.5 the time to do so has come
one commentator has stated that` cyclobenzaprine was unrealistic' if it intended to ban district_courts from making prima_facie_findings of obviousness prior to consideration of objective_indicia

2012 newman j. dissenting` the district_court holding that a prima_facie_case of obviousness was established on the prior_art alone shifted the burden of proof to the patentee to rebut the asserted but improper prima_facie_case with the evidence of commercial_success and copying
this is a distortion of the burden of proof which never leaves the challenger

the prima_facie_approach to obviousness jumbles the proper order of operations

2007 calling the prima_facie_test` consistent with the legal principles enunciated in ksr'

consistent with the prima_facie_approach endorsed by some of our past decisions the district_court here proceeded in four steps it 1 considered the first three graham_factors ; 2 made a legal prima_facie determination of obviousness ; 3 considered objective_indicia of nonobviousness ; and 4 made an ultimate_conclusion of obviousness
steps one and three are factual whereas steps two and four are legal
it is clear to me that courts are making a legal_determination of obviousness at step two
as a result all of the facts concerning patentability are not considered
this is error

i read supreme_court and federal circuit precedent to require all factual_analysis to occur prior to achieving a legal_conclusion on non-obviousness
this should be done without resort to an intermediate *1358 prima_facie_conclusion
see e.g. graham 383 u.s. at 36 86_s.ct._684 not making a prima_facie_conclusion and instead reserving any legal_conclusion until after discussion of all factual predicates ; ksr 550 u.s. at 426 127_s.ct._1727 same ; apple 839 f.3d at 1058 same ; cyclobenzaprine 676 f.3d at 1081-83 same ; stratoflex 713 f.2d at 1539 same
thus i would instruct the district_court to abandon the prima_facie_framework and instead proceed in two steps 1 consider all factual evidence both favoring and disfavoring a finding of obviousness ; and 2 make a legal_conclusion of obviousness
accord wm
wrigley_jr._co. 683 f.3d at 1370 newman j. dissenting ; robert a. matthews jr. annotated patent digest ¡± 18:93` a court should consider evidence of secondary_considerations together with the evidence alleged to create a prima_facie_case of obviousness before determining whether an invention is or is not obvious
in other_words secondary_considerations do not come into play only to rebut a prima_facie_case of obvious even though that is often how they are considered during prosecution
rather the considerations factor in to the initial determination of obviousness
``

i recognize there are practical limitations of legal analysis and writing
a courts opinion must be linear and cover only one issue at a time
typically discussion of the objective_indicia of non-obviousness comes last in an obviousness_analysis
there is nothing inherently wrong with this order per se
again supreme_court precedent is instructive
the court discussed objective_indicia of non-obviousness last in graham
383 u.s. at 35-36 86_s.ct._684
so too in ksr
550 u.s. at 426 127_s.ct._1727
but in both cases the court made no` prima_facie' finding of obviousness did not relegate objective_indicia into an afterthought and reserved its legal_conclusion for after discussion of all relevant factual inquiries
id
our seminal federal circuit decisions have done the same
see apple 839 f.3d at 1058 ; cyclobenzaprine 676 f.3d at 1081-83 ; stratoflex 713 f.2d at 1539
but the notion that objective criteria are considered after a legal prima_facie_showing is made has taken root like a spreading vine
this gives rise to cases such as this case on appeal where a court determines that a particularly` strong' prima_facie_showing has been made making it difficult if not impossible for adequate weighing of evidence of objective_indicia of non-obviousness

this case presents a textbook example of why courts should not make any determinations of obviousness prima_facie or otherwise prior to considering objective_indicia of non-obviousness
here kellogg responded to krafts patent infringement suit by alleging that krafts patent was invalid for obviousness
kellogg presented evidence of prior_art that it alleged a person of ordinary_skill would have been motivated to combine

in response to kelloggs evidence of obviousness kraft presented at least three objective_indicia of nonobviousness
the district_court wrote that kraft` has offered substantial evidence from which a jury could find that its invention has been commercially successful'
j.a
29
kraft presented evidence that its sales volume increased four percent due to the invention
j.a
28
it also presented` evidence of positive consumer feedback' and survey results showing that the invention` was a clear favorite for nearly all' survey respondents
j.a
29
the court also found that kraft introduced evidence of long-felt but unsolved_need
id
it explained that kraft won` one of the highest industry awards innovative packaging technology can receive' and pointed to` many industry publications' praising the technology
id
finally kraft presented evidence` show [ ing ] that kellogg intentionally copied *1359 [ krafts ] packaging'
id
the court found this evidence of copying to be` compelling'
id

i am left to wonder how` substantial' and` compelling' evidence of objective_indicia can not overcome a prima_facie_showing
if such significant evidence does not make a difference in this case it is hard to imagine a situation in which it would

because it affirms on obviousness grounds the majority does not discuss the district_courts grant of summary_judgment of no literal_infringement
because i would reverse the obviousness_determination i would review the infringement finding
i would find reversible_error in the district_courts claim_construction which led to its finding of no literal_infringement

kraft sued kellogg for inter_alia literal_infringement of the532_patent
central to krafts infringement allegation was the claim_term` sealing_layer' which appears in claim 1 of the532_patent
the parties disputed the construction of` sealing_layer' in their claim_construction briefs and at the claim_construction hearing

following briefing and argument the district_court issued a markman_order construing` sealing_layer'
the court concluded that the532_patent claims require` the sealing_layer to be a distinct_layer from the top of the container'
j.a
44
the court went on this does not mean however that the sealing_layer must be physically separated from the top of the container or more specifically from the wrapper that forms the top of the container as described in claim 1
in particular the requirement of a distinct_layer does not preclude the sealing_layer from being laminated to another layer or layers of the wrapper
one layer of material that is laminated to another is no less a distinct_layer
in other_words` distinct' and` separate' have different meanings in this context
j.a
45 emphases added
neither party disputes that this construction as expressed in the markman_order is correct

in its subsequent summary_judgment_order however the court construed` sealing_layer' differently
the summary_judgment_order stated that the sealing_layer` must be a separate_piece of material'
j.a
32
this construction was outcome-determinative the court noted that it granted summary_judgment of no literal_infringement` based on [ its ] construction of the claim_termsealing_layer
`` j.a
31 ; see also id
(` because the top and cut-out flap are notdistinct_layers in the accused products-rather they are part of the same layer-kellogg does not literally infringe the sealing_layer limitation
``

the courts new_construction at summary_judgment contradicts its markman construction that stated the sealing_layer did not need to be a separate_piece of material
this distinction is critical because if the sealing_layer need not be separate from the top of the container then a reasonable_jury could conclude that kellogg literally infringed the532_patent
the majority_opinion fails to address this issue at all either in its recitation of the facts or its analysis of the law
kraft was entitled to a consistent construction of` sealing_layer' throughout the case or at minimum to *1360 have an opportunity to respond to the courts new_construction

i respectfully dissent from judgment of the majority to 1 affirm the district_courts grant of summary_judgment of obviousness and 2 not address the courts claim_construction error
