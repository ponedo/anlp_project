deangelo also appeals the district_courts evidentiary ruling and claim_construction underlying the jury_verdict and the denial of deangelos motion to sanction mes for failing to conduct an adequate pre-filing investigation
for the reasons set forth below this court affirms

i
background
a
the patents in suit
water jacketed marine_exhaust_systems cool exhaust as it exits the engine of a marine vessel
these devices generally consist of two metal cylinders with exhaust flowing through the inner cylinder and water flowing through the space between the inner and outer_cylinders
the patents in suit are directed to an apparatus that more efficiently cools exhaust by tapering the tail_end of the outer_liner so it directs the cooling water into the exhaust_stream and prevents water migration and corrosion by tapering the tail_end of the inner_liner to reduce the turbulence at the end of the pipe

woods filed u.s. patent application no._08 /419,097` ¡¬097_application' on april_10,_1995
the ¡¬097_application disclosed and claimed 1 a water jacketed exhaust system with an elongated tapered inner_liner and outer_shell ; 2 a spacer separating the liner and shell ; and 3 the inner and outer tapered_surfaces acting as a clip for turbulence and a deflection_surface respectively
*1276 see e.g. ¡¬097_application_claim 1
on december 29 1995 woods filed u.s. patent application no._08 /580,548` ¡¬548_application' as a continuation-in-part` cip' of the ¡¬097_application
the ¡¬ 548 applications claims were broader than the ¡¬097_applications claims
for example claim 1 of the ¡¬548_application required extension of the inner_liner beyond the outer_shell but did not limit the tapered_surfaces to deflecting water and clipping turbulence
compare ¡¬097_application_claim 1 with ¡¬548_application claim 1

on july_1,_1996 an examiner rejected all claims of the ¡¬097_application as anticipated by u.s
patents_no._5212,949` shiozawa' and no._799013` moffitt'
instead of responding to the ¡¬097 anticipation rejection woods allowed the ¡¬097_application to go abandoned and continued to prosecute the cip ¡¬548_application
on april_25,_1997 the same_examiner who had rejected the ¡¬097_application allowed several of the claims in the ¡¬548_application
on april_21,_1998 the ¡¬548_application issued as the ¡¬670_patent

on december 15 1997 before the ¡¬548_application had matured into the ¡¬670_patent woods filed cip application no._08 /990,821` ¡¬821_application'
the invention claimed in the ¡¬821_application was similar to that of the ¡¬548_application but was not limited to an elongated inner_liner extending beyond the outer_shell
on april_1,_1999 the examiner rejected claims 1-4 6 and 8-21 of the ¡¬821_application as anticipated by u.s. patent no._4977,741` lulloff'
woods amended the claims by reciting a spacer between the inner and outer_cylinders that created a back_pressure so that water forcefully sprayed out of a spray_ring
woods argued that lulloff did not contain this limitation and that the amended claims were not anticipated
woods never argued that the claims were or were not patentable as initially written
the examiner allowed the amended claims and the ¡¬821_application issued as the ¡¬ 633 patent on march_14,_2000
woods exclusively licensed both the ¡¬670 and ¡¬633_patent_s to mes

b. pre-suit investigation
mes competes with deangelo in the marine exhaust system market
sometime prior to march 2006 other members of the industry informed mes that deangelo was selling exhaust systems that were believed to infringe the woods_patents
based on these statements on march_10,_2006 mes wrote a letter to deangelo requesting information on its water cooled products
deangelo indicated in an april_3,_2006 response that it would investigate mess infringement concerns and contact mes
deangelo never contacted mes after sending its initial april_3,_2006 letter
over a year later one of mess employees photographed an allegedly infringing deangelo device on a vessel in west_palm_beach fl
a year after that sheila prieschl vice president of mes personally inspected and photographed additional deangelo devices
on december 31 2008 after reviewing these photographs mes and woods filed this patent infringement suit in the united_states_district_court for the southern_district of florida

c. the proceedings below
woodss suit alleged that deangelo infringed one or more claims of the ¡¬670 or ¡¬633_patent_s and sought both damages and injunctive relief
deangelo responded that it did not infringe the woods_patents and that the asserted_claims are invalid as obvious under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103
the case moved forward with discovery set to close on february 9 2010

from the record it appears that on may_15,_2009 mes propounded interrogatory 25 which read` state with specificity all prior_art that anticipates such_claims of *1277 one or more of the patents at issue or renders them obvious
in doing so specify the particular_claim being referred to and identify why such_prior_art anticipates such_claims or renders them obvious'

id

on february 8 2010 the day before discovery closed deangelo located several engineering drawings that allegedly predated the ¡¬670 and ¡¬633_patent_s. deangelo immediately forwarded the drawings to mes with a letter stating that` [ t ] hese documents arguably may anticipate the woods invention s or may be relied upon as showing the state of the art in the early 1990s'

it appears that mes did not object at that time

these were the drawings found on february 8 2010
on february 24 2010 deangelo alleged that mes and woods failed to conduct an adequate pre-filing investigation and moved for sanctions under rule 11 of the federal_rules of civil_procedure

a two-week jury trial commenced on april_5,_2010
at the beginning of deangelos defense mes moved under federal_rules of civil_procedure 26_and_37 to strike the drawings_deangelo had found on february 8 2010
see mot
to strike drawings
mes argued that because deangelo had failed to adequately supplement interrogatory 25 with information about these drawings they were not properly identified prior to the close of discovery and should be excluded
the district_court found a violation of rule 26 e ruling that a party confronted with interrogatory [ sic ] of that nature has some obligation to move forward with the development of its defense and in a timely fashion to respond and supplement to its answer.. [ t ] o wait to do that until february 8th of 2010 is not responsible.. [ t ] his is not a timely response and it is not a timely_supplement to the propounded interrogatory
it is not a timely_supplement to the answer that was [ originally ] given.. its timing is way off it should have done that much earlier

the court then found deangelos untimely disclosure neither justified nor harmless and excluded the drawings pursuant to *1278 federal_rule of civil_procedure 37 c 1
the jury found woodss patents valid and infringed and deangelo renewed its motions for jmol on validity and infringement
on june_3,_2010 the court denied deangelos motions for jmol and for sanctions against woods and mes
deangelo timely appealed and alleges five errors by the district_court 1 the exclusion of its drawings ; 2 the district_courts claim_construction ; 3 denial of jmol as to validity ; 4 denial of jmol as to non-infringement ; and 5 denial of its motion to impose rule 11 sanctions

b
federal_rule of civil_procedure 26_and_35 u.s.c.¡± 282
deangelos principal argument is that the district_court erred by excluding the engineering drawings disclosed on february 8 2010 as an untimely interrogatory supplement despite deangelos identification of the drawings immediately upon finding them and on the final_day of the scheduled discovery_period
deangelo points out that it stated in its initial interrogatory_response that it had not decided which prior_art_references it would use and would disclose the references on which it would rely as required by 35 u.s.c.¡± 282
it is undisputed that these drawings were *1279 disclosed more than thirty days before trial as specified by ¡± 282
deangelo also argues that the court failed to address its contention that mes waived its right to object to the drawings by not objecting when it received them

mes counters that the court properly excluded the drawings because deangelo failed to supplement its answer to mess interrogatory 25 failed to justify its late_disclosure and failed to show that the late_disclosure was harmless
oral arg.at 20:50-21:20 available at http //www.cafc.uscourts.gov/oral-argument-recordings/2010-1478/all/woods.html
accordingly this appeal requires us to determine whether the district_court abused its discretion by excluding the drawings despite deangelos discovery and disclosure of the drawings within the thirty-day period required by ¡± 282 and within the discovery_period set by the court

1
we begin by disposing of deangelos argument that mes waived its right to object to the drawings
deangelo cites several cases to support its contention that mes waived its right to object by not doing so when it received deangelos letter disclosing the drawings and supplementing its interrogatory answer
see butler v. pettigrew 409_f.2d_1205 1207 7th cir.1969 finding waiver when plaintiffs did not object until after entry of judgment ; sure fill & seal inc. v. gff inc. 2010_wl_3063287 at *big_token__7_n._4_ m.d.fla._july_6 _2010 __big_token citing brandt v. vulcan inc. 30_f.3d_752 756-57 7th cir.1994
those cases merely support the proposition that a trial courts decision whether or not to find waiver is discretionary-they do not compel this court to find that a district_court abuses its discretion when it does not find waiver in a case like this
here the district_court was given no clear basis on which to find waiver and we see no reason to question the district_courts actions or re-visit the issue
accordingly we turn to the merits of deangelos argument

2
this court generally reviews application of the federal_rules of civil_procedure by applying the law of the regional_circuit
trilogy commc'ns. inc. v. times fiber commc'ns. inc. 109_f.3d_739 744 fed.cir.1997
the eleventh_circuit has recognized that courts have broad discretion to fashion discovery sanctions
united_states v. certain real prop
located at route 1 bryant ala. 126_f.3d_1314 1317 11th cir.1997
issues that are` unique to patent_law' however are reviewed as a matter of federal_circuit_law
o2_micro 467 f.3d at 1364
the application of ¡± 282 is` unique to patent_law'
thus federal_circuit_law governs its application

rule 26 imposes an obligation on parties to conduct a reasonable_inquiry into the factual basis of their discovery_responses and requires that a party who` responded to an interrogatory.. supplement or correct its disclosure or response.. in a timely_manner if the party learns that in some material_respect the disclosure or response is incomplete or incorrect..' fed.r.civ.p
26 e 1 ; see also id
26 b
indeed the district_court has discretion when circumstances warrant to exclude evidence not produced in compliance with a proper discovery request
see goodman-gable-gould 595 f.3d at 1210-13 affirming the district_courts exclusion of evidence because statements made during a deposition and references to relevant expenses in a discovery supplement did not provide notice of the partys theory of liability ; those disclosures did not constitute a supplement at all ; see also innogenetics n.v. v. abbott labs. 512_f.3d_1363 1375-76 fed.cir.2008 affirming the district_courts exclusion of a prior_art *1280 patent disclosed on the final_day of discovery because` the time for depositions had passed [ and ] abbott had not discussed the cha_patent in an expert report identified it during discovery in response to innogenetics interrogatories on anticipation or mentioned it in the final pretrial conference'

contention interrogatories-like the interrogatory here-serve an important_purpose in helping to discover facts supporting the theories of the parties
answers to contention_interrogatories also serve to narrow and sharpen the issues thereby confining discovery and simplifying trial preparation
see fed.r.civ.p
33 advisory_committees note 1970 amendment subdivision b
this court has recognized that answers to contention_interrogatories evolve over time as theories of liability and defense begin to take shape ; answers to those interrogatories may not come into focus until the end of discovery
see o2_micro 467 f.3d at 1365
rule 26 e requires that as theories mature and as the relevance of various items of evidence changes responses to interrogatories and particularly contention_interrogatories be corrected or supplemented to reflect those changes

the district_court has considerable discretion in overseeing compliance with the federal_rules of civil_procedure including discretion to permit parties to defer supplementing responses to contention_interrogatories until theories of the case have ripened for trial
given that deferred responses to contention_interrogatories may result in considerable last minute activity in preparation for trial however some courts have passed local rules limiting the extent to which parties are at liberty to defer answering contention_interrogatories
see id.at 1365-66
independent of the existence vel non of such local rules district_courts have discretion to exclude evidence when a party acts in bad faith or prejudices its adversary by deliberately delaying or wholly failing to respond to contention_interrogatories
see zenith elecs corp. v. wh-tv broad. corp. 395_f.3d_416 420 7th cir.2005` the district judge banned evidence on that subject after wh-tv failed to respond to zeniths contentions interrogatory with a description of its damages theory and the proof to be employed.. his decision was not an abuse of discretion
``

recognizing the evolving nature of the contentions of the parties leading up to trial and to protect patentees from unfair and prejudicial_surprise at trial congress established 35 u.s.c.¡± 282 to provide a statutory outer limit for the disclosure of certain information relating specifically to defenses to be relied upon by an accused infringer at trial
section 282 requires notice in writing at least thirty days before the trial of.. any publication to be relied upon.. as showing the state of the art and the name and address of any person who may be relied upon as the prior inventor or as having prior knowledge of or as having previously used or offered for sale the invention of the patent in suit
in the absence of such notice proof of the said matters may not be made at the trial except on such terms as the court requires

section 282 does not eliminate a defendants obligations under the federal_rules of civil_procedure
to the contrary the statute and the rules are intended to coexist
see atd corp. v. lydall inc. 159_f.3d_534 551 fed.cir.1998` the purpose of ¡± 282 like that of the federal_rules is to prevent unfair and prejudicial_surprise not to facilitate last-minute production of evidence
`` ; see also thermo king corp. v. whites trucking serv. inc. 292_f.2d_668 674 5th cir.1961

*1281 3
during the hearing on mess motion to exclude the drawings the district_court treated the timing of the production of the drawings and the supplementation of the interrogatory as two separate but related issues
see prior_art_argument at 3-8
when gathering the facts necessary to its decision the district_court inquired` why were [ the drawings ] not produced in an earlier fashion and why was the answer to the interrogatory not supplemented at an earlier time'
id.at 8 emphasis added
after receiving deangelos response describing why the documents were not produced earlier the district_court again asked` why was n't the answer to the interrogatory supplemented ?'
id.at 12
in issuing its decision the district_court specifically considered deangelos contention that the e-mail of february 8 2010 was a supplement to interrogatory 25
id.at 24
the court quoted the e-mail which was admittedly` general' and concluded that the e-mail was` not a timely_supplement to the propounded interrogatory'
id

while the ruling by the district_court did not explicitly address the propriety of the supplementation and focused primarily on the issue of timeliness the record is clear that both issues were presented to the district_court and are reiterated before us on appeal
mes specifically argues that` [ w ] hile deangelo provided the documents to mess attorney on february 8 2010 deangelo did not clearly state the purpose of the documents or how they might be used'
appellees br
20
mes thus argues that the february 8 e-mail` did not serve to supplement the mandatory rule 26 disclosures or the interrogatory_responses'
id.at 22 emphasis added
woods also specifically raised the issue at oral_argument stating` there was no rule 26 e disclosure-the providing of the documents without answering the questions that we actually asked and without giving us the information that we actually needed is not a satisfactory rule 26 e disclosure'
see oral arg.at 20:48-21:04
thus the` issue' here-whether deangelos e-mail of february 8 constituted an adequate and timely_supplement to its interrogatory_response-includes consideration of both the timeliness of the response and the propriety of the supplementation of the interrogatory itself

4
the district_court held that the documents in question were not timely produced and imposed a sanction under rule 37 c for their late production
to be sure ¡± 282 in requiring that a party` give notice.. in writing to the adverse party at least thirty days before the trial.. of any publication to be relied upon as anticipation of the patent in suit or.. as showing the state of the art' imposes only a minimum limit on the duty to disclose prior_art_references
the district_court by local rule1 or by court order,2 may require such production at an earlier date
but the problem here is that there was no such local rule or court order save the order setting a discovery_deadline of february 9 2010
the documents were disclosed on february 8 before the discovery_deadline and before the thirty day outer *1282 limit set by ¡± 282
furthermore rule 26 e requires only that parties supplement prior discovery_responses` in a timely_manner if the party learns that in some material_respect the disclosure or response is incomplete or incorrect..' fed.r.civ.p
26 e 1 a emphasis added
the rule prohibits parties who are aware of their deficient response from` hold [ ing ] back material items and disclos [ ing ] them at the last moment'
8a charles alan wright & arthur r. miller federal practice and procedure ¡± 2049.1 3d ed.2011 ; see also fed.r.civ.p
26 advisory_committees note 1993 amendment subdivision e` the obligation to supplement disclosures and discovery_responses applies whenever a party learns that its prior disclosures or responses are in some material_respect incomplete or incorrect`
deangelo disclosed the drawings within one day of their discovery and thus did not shirk its obligations under rule 26 e with respect to timely production of the drawings
whether deangelo made a reasonable_inquiry in the first instance however as to the whereabouts of such drawings is unclear
but we need not answer that question as the issue before us can be resolved on the basis of the inadequacy of the supplementation itself

this court agrees with the district_court that rule 26 e was violated and concludes that the district_court imposed an appropriate sanction
the interrogatory in question did more than require the identification of documents a requirement that deangelo satisfied by the production
it requested that deangelo` [ s ] tate with specificity all prior_art that anticipates such_claims of one or more of the patents at issue or renders them obvious
in doing so specify the particular_claim being referred to and identify why such_prior_art anticipates such_claims or renders them obvious'
mot
to strike drawings at 1-2 emphasis added
while deangelos e-mail of february 8 2010 in which it disclosed the drawings stated that the drawings` may anticipate the woods inventions or may be relied upon as showing the state of the art in the early 1990s' deangelo did not comply with the emphasized requirements before the discovery_deadline
such compliance was important
as discussed above contention_interrogatories serve an important_purpose in enabling a party to discover facts related to its opponents contentions
in order for mes to have an opportunity to meaningfully challenge deangelos reliance on the drawings as prior_art including whether the drawings were published or whether devices made from the drawings contained the claimed features and were in fact on sale in the early 1990s it would have needed to know what features of the drawings_deangelo contended rendered mess patents obvious on a claim-by-claim basis.3 see innogenetics 512 f.3d at 1376` abbotts disclosure of the cha_patent as an anticipatory prior_art reference on the very last day of discovery meant innogenetics was stripped of any meaningful opportunity to prepare an adequate cross-examination of the reference`
having failed to provide mes with this information deangelos purported supplement of its response to interrogatory 25 was in violation of rule 26 e

having properly found that deangelos failure to supplement its interrogatory_response was a violation of rule 26 e the district_court was well within its discretion in excluding the drawings under federal_rule of civil_procedure 37 c
the court found that deangelos failure to *1283 supplement its interrogatory_response harmed mes because the drawings themselves were not prior_art and mes would need to depose people and subpoena records to defend against testimony that these drawings would elicit
prior_art_argument at 25-30
the court found that mes could not cure this harm at such a late stage
id
this court sees no error in the district_courts explicit findings that deangelos failure to supplement its interrogatory_response prejudiced mes and hindered mess ability to put on its case and that this error was not substantially justified or harmless
see fed.r.civ.p
37 c` if a party fails to [ supplement an interrogatory_response ] as required by rule [ 26 e ] the party is not allowed to use that information.. to supply evidence on a motion at a hearing or at a trial unless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless
`` ; see also eaton corp. v. appliance valves corp. 790_f.2d_874 879 fed.cir.1986` the boundaries of the district_courts discretion are defined by unfair prejudicial harm to a party deprived of an adequate opportunity to present its case`
thus we find that the district_court did not abuse its discretion in precluding deangelo from relying on the drawings as prior_art

c. claim construction
deangelo next argues that the district_court erred in its construction of four disputed claim_terms
according to deangelo the courts constructions fail to account for the inventions physical and functional limitations required by the specifications
see icu med. inc. v. alaris med
sys. inc. 558_f.3d_1368 1375-76 fed.cir.2009
mes counters that deangelo merely proposes alternative more restrictive descriptions of terms that already have a clear meaning to one of skill in the art and the district_courts construction correctly refrains from reading unnecessary limitations into the claims
see phillips v. awh corp. 415_f.3d_1303 1323 fed.cir.2005 en banc

claim_terms are given their ordinary and customary meaning-the meaning that they would have to a person of ordinary_skill in the art in light of the specification and prosecution history at the time of the invention
id.at 1312-13
the specification need not describe every embodiment of the claimed invention see netword llc v. centraal corp. 242_f.3d_1347 1352 fed.cir.2001 and the claims should not be confined to the disclosed embodiments-even when the specification discloses only one embodiment phillips 415 f.3d at 1323

claim_terms are properly construed to include limitations not otherwise inherent in the term only` when a patentee sets out a definition and acts as his own_lexicographer' or` when the patentee disavows the full scope of a claim_term either in the specification or during prosecution'
thorner v. sony computer entm't
am. llc 669_f.3d_1362 1365 fed.cir.2012
`` to act as its own_lexicographer a patentee mustclearly set forth a definition of the disputed claim_term..' id
( quoting ccs fitness inc. v. brunswick corp. 288_f.3d_1359 1366 fed.cir.2002
moreover` [ w ] here the specification makes clear that the invention does not include a particular feature that feature is deemed to be outside.. the patent even though the language of the claims read without reference to the specification might be considered broad enough to encompass the feature in question'
id.at 1366 internal citation omitted
as detailed below the district_courts construction of each term is consistent with the plain_meaning of the term while deangelos constructions require us to adopt limitations not defined in or required by the specification

*1284 1
`` elongated outer_shell' deangelo argues that the courts construction of the claimed expression` elongated outer_shell' as` the outer pipe that extends past the spray_ring' is overly broad and should be limited to outer_shells having a length sufficient to deflect and break apart water from the spray_ring-the function stated in the specification
mes counters that the plain_meaning of` elongated' outer_shell is simply that the outer_shell extends past the spray_ring
mes points to claims that cover an embodiment where the water is not directed toward the outer_shell
see ¡¬633_patent_col. 7_ll._45 -62 ; ¡¬670_patent_col. 6_ll._17 -33
mes thus contends that defining the term` elongated outer_shell' as a shell long enough to deflect water improperly reads a limitation into the term-a limitation not required by every embodiment

mes is correct
nothing in the plain_meaning of` elongated outer_shell' requires that the shell extend far enough past the inner shell to serve as a deflection plane for water
in fact` elongated' is an adjective used to describe both the inner_liner and outer_shell within the same claim
compare ¡¬ 633 patent_col. 7_l._48_(``an_elongated_inner_liner'') with ¡¬ 633 patent_col. 7_l._50_(``an_elongated_outer_shell'')
therefore` elongated' can not mean long enough to provide a deflection_surface ; and` outer_shell' simply refers to the outer cylinder
woodss abandonment of the ¡¬097_application an event that deangelo stresses in its obviousness argument further undermines deangelos claim_construction argument
the claims of the abandoned ¡¬097_application expressly required a deflection_surface for the sprayed water
the ¡¬670_patents claims do not have such a limitation

the patentee did not expressly define` elongated outer_shell' as providing a deflection_surface nor did he disavow an outer_liner that does not deflect water
this court will not read such a limitation into the term merely because it is disclosed in some embodiments
phillips 415 f.3d at 1323
the district_court correctly construed` elongated outer_shell'

2
`` inwardly tapered_section' deangelo next argues that the court erred in construing the phrase` inwardly tapered_section' as` the section of the elongated outer_shell or elongated inner_liner that has a reduction in diameter'
just as deangelo urged us to limit` elongated outer_shell' to account for the` functional limitation' of a water deflection_surface it argues that` inwardly tapered_section' should also be so limited
according to deangelo the term should be construed to require the tapered_section occur near the tail_end of the shell so water can deflect off of the tapered_surface
in support deangelo points to embodiments in the specification where water collides with the inwardly tapered_section
see e.g. ¡¬670_patent_col. 2_u._25 -28
mes disagrees and argues that while some embodiments may indeed function by deflecting water off of the tapered_surface into the exhaust_stream the claims need not be restricted to that embodiment
we see nothing in the claims or written description to warrant limiting this term to a single embodiment
the district_court correctly construed` inwardly tapered_section' not to require a deflection_surface

3
`` directed towards' deangelo argues that the district_courts construction of the phrase` directed towards' as` caused to flow in a direction that results in contact with' is overly broad because the specification requires the water to hit the liner with enough force to fan out not merely contact the liner
mes counters that the ordinary_meaning of the phrase` directed towards' *1285 is clear and unencumbered with the additional limitation deangelo seeks to incorporate
according to mes nothing warrants adding the requirement of a forceful collision to the term` directed towards'

the district_courts construction of` directed towards' is correct
like the other disputed terms the specification does not require the water to forcefully collide with a surface
for example some claims specifically require that the water forcefully exit the spray_ring and flow towards a wall other claims do not require such force
compare ¡¬670_patent_col. 6_l._64 -col. 7_l._4 with ¡¬633_patent_col. 8_ll._49 -53
the patentee never expressly defined` directed towards' nor did he disavow the clear definition found by the district_court
this court will not construe this otherwise clear term to include a limitation already present in some claims but not others

4
`` angularly disposed' finally deangelo argues that the district_courts construction of` angularly disposed' as` a spray_ring positioned in a way that is not parallel or perpendicular to the central_axis of the inner_liner' is overbroad because it does not limit the spray of the water stream towards the outer_shell
deangelo claims that the courts construction allows a spray_ring that directs water towards the inner_liner an embodiment not described in the specification
according to deangelo` [ t ] he specifications of each of the patents-in-suit disclose only two possible orientations for the spray_ring' at an approximately 90¢X angle relevant to the central_axis or directed towards the outer_liner
appellants br
55
mes accuses deangelo of again reading an unwarranted limitation into the claims based on specific embodiments in contravention of phillips 415 f.3d at 1323

the district_courts construction comports with the ordinary_meaning of this term
the phrase` angularly disposed' does not prescribe any specific angle
the patentee never defined the term nor disavowed a broader meaning
furthermore it is not necessary to read deangelos proposed limitation into the term because every claim that uses this term already limits the ring to being directed toward the outer wall
see ¡¬670_patent_col. 6_l._54 -col. 7_l._4 col. 7_l._12 -col. 8_l._12 ; ¡¬633_patent_col. 8_ll._35 -53 col. 9_ll._11 -18

the district_court correctly declined to read unwarranted limitations into the disputed claim_terms
for the foregoing reasons this court affirms the district_courts claim_construction

d. validity
deangelo challenges the district_courts denial of jmol that the asserted_claims of woodss patents are invalid as obvious under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103
deangelo sets forth three main arguments in support of its obviousness contention
first deangelo argues that the prior_art_patents contain every limitation of woodss asserted_claims and woods admitted as much during prosecution when he chose to add an additional claim_limitation instead of arguing to the examiner that the reference did not anticipate the claim
deangelo then argues that its excluded prior_art_drawings see supra ¡± ii.b. render the claims obvious
finally deangelo contends that the key_marine_riser a product that predates woodss patents exhibits a tapered_inner_liner the only element of the asserted_claims that is arguably not shown in the prior_art_patents

mes counters that the prior_art_references do not show every limitation of woodss asserted_claims ; they specifically lack any teaching of a tapered_inner_liner
mes also argues that because deangelos prior_art_drawings were properly excluded they can not support an obvious rejection
*1286 moreover mes argues that the jury had the opportunity to observe the key_marine_riser and still concluded that it did not render the claims of woodss patents obvious
finally mes characterizes woodss patents as having solved a longstanding problem in the marine exhaust industry and that such a showing is objective evidence of non-obviousness

the supreme court reaffirmed the appropriate obviousness_analysis in ksr international co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007)
the court instructed us to 1 determine the scope and content of the prior_art 2 ascertain the differences between the prior_art and the claims at issue 3 resolve the level of ordinary_skill in the art and 4 determine obviousness in light of objective factors like` commercial success long felt but unsolved needs failure of others etc'
ksr 550 u.s. at 406 127_s.ct._1727 quoting graham v. john deere co. of kansas city 383_u.s._1 17-18 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966)
at bottom the obviousness_analysis is a common sense test and` [ i ] f a person of ordinary_skill.. would have found the invention [ a ] predictable and achievable variation or combination of the prior_art then the invention likely would have been obvious'

the prior art patents
deangelo first contends that because all claims of woodss initial ¡¬097_application were rejected as anticipated by the shiozawa and moffit_references woodss abandonment of the ¡¬097_application is` an inference if not an admission that the claims of that application are unpatentable as being anticipated by both shiozawa and moffit thus defining the scope and content of the prior_art'
appellants br
36
mes contests that assertion and cites paperless accounting v. bay area rapid transit system 804_f.2d_659_(fed.cir.1986) to support the proposition that woodss decision to abandon the ¡¬097_application and pursue the broader ¡¬548_application can not constitute even an inference that the ¡¬097_application was properly rejected
mes argues that although shiozawa and moffit are within the prior_art neither teaches an inwardly tapered_tail_end of the inner_liner

deangelos characterization of woodss abandonment of the ¡¬097_application as an admission that the shiozawa and moffit_references disclose every element of woodss patents is meritless
deangelo fails to consider that woods filed the ¡¬548_application more than six months before the examiner rejected the ¡¬097_application
moreover the claims in the ¡¬548_application are arguably broader than the claims in the ¡¬097_application and woods prosecuted the ¡¬548_application before the same_examiner who eventually rejected the ¡¬097_application
there is nothing to suggest that woods did anything other than simply choose to pursue the similar but broader ¡¬548_application instead of continuing to prosecute the ¡¬097_application
this court declines to characterize woodss conduct as an admission or concession that the claims in the ¡¬097_application are anticipated by shiozawa or moffitt

deangelo next contends that woodss amendment in response to the examiners april_1,_1999 rejection constituted an admission that the originally filed claims of the ¡¬821_application ultimately the ¡¬633_patent were anticipated by lulloff
deangelo argues that woods acquiesced to the substance of the examiners rejection because woods added a different limitation instead of arguing that lulloff does not teach a tapered_liner
according to deangelo this qualifies as an admission that all limitations in the initial claims *1287 including the tapered_liner existed in the prior_art
deangelo urges us to preclude mes from now arguing that lulloff does not contain a tapered_liner

in torpharm inc. v. ranbaxy pharmaceuticals inc. 336_f.3d_1322 1330 fed.cir.2003 this court rejected ranbaxys similar acquiescence rationale explaining that` ranbaxys argument blurs the distinction between claims and limitations patentability is assessed for the former not the latter'
explicit limitations are material to the infringement inquiry
id.at 1331_n._9
but viewing an amendment as an admission that the initial claim was unpatentable requires more than the mere presence of a limitation
see id.at 1330

deangelo relies on a number of reissue proceeding cases like hester industries inc. v. stein inc. 142_f.3d_1472_(fed.cir.1998) which address the surrender of subject matter during the initial prosecution
but hester cites mentor corp. v. coloplast inc. 998_f.2d_992 995 fed.cir.1993 which suggests there must be additional evidence e.g. argument to the examiner to support a conclusion that an amendment was an admission
hester 142 f.3d at 1480-81
deangelo also relies on lemelson v. general mills inc. 968_f.2d_1202 1207-08 fed.cir.1992 to support its acquiescence_theory
but in lemelson it is not clear to what extent the patentee argued the rejection with the examiner
id
moreover this court specifically distinguished lemelson in torpharm based on similar facts to those here
torpharm 336 f.3d at 1331_n._9

this court does not accept deangelos acquiescence_theory as support for its contention that lulloff contains a tapered_surface as a matter of law
the examiner rejected the ¡¬821_application as anticipated by lulloff which showed an elongated liner and shell with an inwardly tapered_section
woods made no statement representing that a tapered_liner was not disclosed by lulloff
he never admitted it
he never addressed it
all he argued to the examiner was that using a spacer to create back_pressure in the inner volume was not disclosed by lulloff
a patent applicant is not presumed to have conceded the presence in the prior_art of every claim_limitation he had no reason to dispute
this court has considered deangelos other arguments that woodss specifications and the prior_art_patents render the asserted_claims of the woods_patents obvious and finds them to be without merit

2
excluded drawings and the key_marine_riser
deangelo also argues that its excluded drawings demonstrate that every limitation of the asserted_claims was known in the prior_art
as discussed above see supra ¡± ii.b the district_court properly excluded these drawings and the drawings are properly excluded from the obviousness_analysis
finally deangelo relies on the` key_marine_riser' a device presented to the jury to show that a tapered_tail_end existed in the prior_art
but the jury physically inspected the key_marine_riser and was free to conclude that it did not support deangelos theory
deangelo has failed to show that the prior_art singly or collectively disclosed or taught every limitation of the claims at issue
on this evidence this court can not say that the jury could not have sustained the validity of the claims at issue

e. non-infringement
deangelos argument that the district_court erred in denying its motion for jmol of non-infringement is relatively narrow
deangelo argues that mes failed to introduce any infringement evidence other than engineering drawings for deangelos` notched_diffusers' and *1288 that no reasonable_jury could have found infringement based on those drawings
although all of deangelos products contain a hose_bead deangelo stresses that darrin_woodss mess vice-president testimony explaining how the hose_bead creates a tapered_surface dealt only with` conical diffusers'
deangelo thus contends that as a matter of law the` notched_diffusers' can not infringe

mes counters that at trial the jury heard testimony that adding a` hose_bead' to the end of a liner regardless of the type of diffuser would cause an indentation and tapering effect
also the jury was able to physically inspect the key_marine_riser and observe the taper that a hose_bead caused
mes argues that in light of deangelos admission that all of its products contain a hose_bead the evidence of a hose_bead induced taper was sufficient for a reasonable_jury to conclude that deangelos notched_diffusers also had a tapered_liner and infringed the woods_patents

mes is correct
deangelo admitted that all of its products contain a hose_bead
darrin_woods testified that a hose_bead on the diffuser causes an indentation in the liner resulting in the requisite tapered_surface
darrin_woodss testimony was a legally sufficient_basis on which the jury could have found that deangelos notched_diffusers infringed the asserted_claims of the woods_patents
the district_court did not err by denying jmol of non-infringement

f. rule 11 sanctions
finally deangelo alleges that mes and woods filed this lawsuit without conducting an adequate pre-suit investigation into whether or not deangelos products actually infringe
deangelo argues that mes decided to file this lawsuit based only on photographs taken by an mes employee and that mess attorney did not make an adequate infringement determination prior to filing
deangelo stresses that woods made the decision to file the infringement suit based only on grainy photographs that woods himself admitted did not clearly show the elements of the claims
mes counters that the grainy black and white photographs deangelo used to elicit woodss testimony were not the same photos on which the suit was based ; the suit was based on the same high definition color photos presented at trial and used to prove infringement to the jury
moreover woods and mes point out that for over two years deangelo denied them the access to deangelos products that they sought and that deangelo now argues was required

the eleventh_circuit imposes rule 11 sanctions where the` frivolous nature of the claims-at-issue is unequivocal'
carter v. alk_holdings inc. 605_f.3d_1319 1323 fed.cir.2010
in a patent case this court stated that` an attorney violates rule 11 b 3 when an objectively reasonable attorney would not believe based on some actual evidence uncovered during the pre-filing investigation that each claim_limitation reads on the accused device..' antonious v. spalding & evenflo cos. 275_f.3d_1066 1074 fed.cir.2002

here the record is replete with evidence supporting the district_courts conclusion that mes conducted a sufficient pre-filing investigation including photographing and studying photographs of deangelos accused products
see supra ¡± lb
nonetheless deangelo argues that judin v. united_states 110_f.3d_780_(fed.cir.1997) compels the conclusion that mess mere observations of deangelo products can not constitute an adequate investigation
deangelos reliance on judin is misplaced
in judin the plaintiff observed allegedly infringing products from a distance but never sought access to investigate *1289 them more closely
id.at 784
here mes directly requested from deangelo in writing information about deangelos allegedly infringing devices
when that information was not forthcoming mes took the photographs of deangelos products that were used as the basis for filing suit
at trial a number of witnesses testified that they could discern the features covered by the asserted_claims from the digital color photographs
this is not a case like judin where the plaintiff sued without seeking access to examine allegedly infringing devices
the district_court did not abuse its discretion in declining to sanction mes

conclusion
for the foregoing reasons the judgment of the district_court is affirmed

affirmed
