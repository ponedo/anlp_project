*1324 clevenger circuit_judge
torpharm inc. appeals the judgment of the united_states_district_court for the district of new_jersey which granted summary_judgment to ranbaxy_pharmaceuticals inc. schein_pharmaceutical inc. danbury_pharmacal inc. ranbaxy_laboratories_limited ranbaxy schein pharma llc and ranbaxy_schein_pharmaceuticals llc collectively` ranbaxy' invalidating torpharms united_states_patent_no._5670,671` ¡¬671' as obvious
torpharm inc. v. ranbaxy_pharms. inc. no._99-_cv-714 d.n.j
aug._6,_2002
because torpharm had relied on the novelty of its` improved form 1 ranitidine' product in prosecuting the ¡¬671_process_claims the district_court ruled that the subsequent_negation of improved form 1 ranitidines novelty in unrelated litigation precluded torpharm from rebutting ranbaxys obviousness challenge to the ¡¬671_process_claims
we hold that despite torpharms assertion of improved form 1 ranitidines novelty during prosecution of the ¡¬671_patent the lack of novelty of the product does not by itself establish that the process for making it is obvious
we therefore reverse the grant of summary_judgment of invalidity and remand the case for further_proceedings

i
this appeal concerns the validity of a patent on a process for making the drug ranitidine
ranitidine is an antihistamine drug that inhibits acid secretion in the stomach and is used to treat ulcers
several patents covering different crystalline forms of ranitidine are owned by nonparty glaxo inc. and have been the subject of extensive litigation
glaxo group v. torpharm inc. 153_f.3d_1366 47_uspq2d_1836_(fed.cir.1998) ; glaxo inc. v. novopharm_ltd. 110_f.3d_1562 42_uspq2d_1257_(fed.cir.1997) ; glaxo inc. v. novopharm_ltd. 52_f.3d_1043 34_uspq2d_1565_(fed.cir.1995)
that litigation has concerned` form 2 ranitidine' a crystalline form of ranitidine that overcame the undesirable drying and filtration characteristics of the original crystalline form` form 1 ranitidine'

the patent in suit owned by torpharm relates to a different crystalline form of ranitidine referred to as` improved form 1 ranitidine'
the ¡¬671_patent discloses a process for producing improved form 1 ranitidine by crystallizing ranitidine from a solution in isopropyl_alcohol
according to the patent specification improved form 1 ranitidine` has characteristics of being harder and denser and providing larger sized crystals' which gives it acceptable filtration and drying characteristics
¡¬671_patent col._3,_ll._26-27
improved form 1 ranitidine is distinguished from form 1 ranitidine by two properties reflecting these characteristics bulk_density and tap_density
according to the patent improved form 1 ranitidine is characterized by a bulk_density of at least 0.23 gm/ml and a tap_density of at least 0.28 gm/ml.1 id.at ll
31-32

all claims of the ¡¬671_patent are directed to a process for producing improved form 1 ranitidine
representative claim 2 illustrates the two principal requirements of the claimed process that it yields form 1 ranitidine of the specified densities and that it involves a three- or four-carbon_alcohol_solvent 2
process for the production of a [ sic ] improved form of form 1 ranitidine_hydrochloride having improved filtration and drying characteristics and having *1325 i a bulk_density of not less than about 0.23 gm/ml ; and ii a tap_density of not less than about 0.28 gm/ml said process comprising adding ranitidine_hydrochloride to a substantially anhydrous hydroxylic solvent comprising at least one alkanol having 3-4 carbon_atoms which has the characteristics that it dissolves ranitidine_hydrochloride and subsequently recovering the improved form of form 1 ranitidine_hydrochloride

as originally filed the application for the ¡¬671_patent did not include the bulk and tap_density_limitations but simply claimed a process yielding` an improved form of form 1 ranitidine_hydrochloride'
the bulk and tap_density_limitations defining the product were later added by amendment to overcome obviousness rejections over the original glaxo patents disclosing form 1 ranitidine

a divisional of the application also yielded united_states_patent_no._5523,423` ¡¬423'
the ¡¬423_patent included a product_claim directed to improved form 1 ranitidine with the specified bulk and tap_density_limitations as well as product-by-process_claims essentially covering the products of the ¡¬ 671 process
however in litigation between torpharm and several other pharmaceutical manufacturers in north carolina the product_claim of the ¡¬ 423 patent was invalidated for lack of novelty by reason of a prior_sale of form 1 ranitidine meeting the bulk and tap_density_limitations

mar._8,_1999 order granting summary_judgment of invalidity
evidence adduced during the north_carolina_litigation revealed that in 1992 more than three years before the priority application for the ¡¬ 423 patent was filed interchem corporation sold three lots 290 kg in all of form 1 ranitidine hydrochloride to geneva pharmaceuticals inc
id. slip op.at 5
neither interchem nor geneva is related to torpharm
quality tests performed by geneva showed that two of the three lots had bulk densities of more than 0.23 gm/ml and tap_densities of more than 0.28 gm/ml
accordingly the north_carolina_district_court held that material meeting the limitations of the ¡¬423 product_claim had been on sale more than one year prior to filing of the patent application thereby invalidating the product_claim under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b2 id. slip op.at 8
however there was and still is no evidence of what process interchem used to make its form 1 ranitidine and by stipulation the product-by-process_claims of the ¡¬423_patent were not at issue in the north_carolina_litigation
id. slip op.at 2

torpharm sued ranbaxy for infringement of the ¡¬671 process patent in the united_states_district_court for the district of new_jersey
ranbaxy moved for summary_judgment of invalidity arguing that` under the principles of prosecution_history estoppel and collateral_estoppel' the ¡¬671_patent was invalid
ranbaxy contended that because the ¡¬671_patent had been allowed` based on a representation by torpharm that the allowance of the ¡¬423_patent made the ¡¬671_patent allowable' the subsequent invalidation of the ¡¬423_patent rendered the ¡¬671_patent invalid as well

the district_court initially denied ranbaxys motion
torpharm_inc. v. ranbaxy_pharms. inc. no._99-_cv-714 d.n.j
aug._17,_2001 order denying summary_judgment
while acknowledging *1326 that torpharm was estopped from re-litigating the validity of the ¡¬423_patent the district_court ruled that the patentability of the ¡¬671_process_claims was not legally linked to the patentability of the ¡¬423 product_claim
however in reaching this conclusion the district_court assumed that improved form 1 ranitidine could still be nonobvious even if not novel by reason of a prior_sale
because torpharm had cited the nonobviousness of improved form 1 ranitidine when arguing for the nonobviousness of the ¡¬671 process during prosecution the district_court reasoned that improved form 1 ranitidines lack of novelty did not dictate obviousness of the ¡¬671_process_claims

ranbaxy requested reconsideration of the district_courts decision
arguing that` anticipation is the epitome of obviousness' 3 connell v. sears roebuck & co. 722_f.2d_1542 1548 220_uspq_193 198 fed.cir.1983 and noting that section 102 b is a source of prior_art for a section 103 determination ranbaxy suggested that` there is error in the notion that an invention can be.. non-obvious if a patent_claim embodying the invention had been invalidated by a section 102 b prior_sale'

while torpharms response maintained that the patentability of the ¡¬671_process_claims was a distinct question from the patentability of the ¡¬423 product_claim given that the north_carolina_decision had not addressed how interchems ranitidine was produced the district_court was persuaded by ranbaxys argument
declaring that` the distinction i made.. between.. nonobviousness on one hand and patentability on the other is a false distinction' the court granted ranbaxys motion for summary_judgment of invalidity
the court reasoned` [ i ] t is clear that the claims of the ¡¬671_patent would not have been allowed but for the alleged novelty of form 1 ranitidine
therefore torpharm can not now argue that the nonobviousness of the ¡¬671_claims is supported by anything other than the novelty of [ improved ] form 1 ranitidine'
given that the north_carolina_decision had held improved form 1 ranitidine to lack novelty under section 102 b the district_court concluded that collateral_estoppel precluded torpharm from disputing the obviousness of the ¡¬671_claims
accordingly the district_court reversed its initial decision and granted ranbaxy summary_judgment that the ¡¬671_process_claims were invalid as obvious under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103

torpharm appeals the judgment of invalidity
we exercise jurisdiction over torpharms appeal pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

when a district_court grants summary_judgment we review without deference to the trial court whether there are disputed material facts and review independently whether the prevailing party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law
novartis corp. v. ben venue labs. inc. 271_f.3d_1043 1046 60_uspq2d_1836 1838 fed.cir.2001
the validity of a patent_claim under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 is a legal determination based on underlying factual findings
loctite corp. v. ultraseal ltd. 781_f.2d_861 872 228_uspq_90 97 fed.cir.1985
as we do for other matters *1327 that do not implicate this courts specialized jurisdiction we review the application of collateral_estoppel as a matter of regional circuit law
bayer ag
v. biovail corp. 279_f.3d_1340 1345 61_uspq2d_1675 1679 fed.cir.2002
the third circuit has acknowledged conflicting decisions applying abuse of discretion or plenary review to a district_courts application of collateral_estoppel
witkowski v. welch 173_f.3d_192 198_n._7_(3d_cir.1999)
however because this case turns on the legal consequence of those matters rendered beyond dispute by collateral_estoppel rather than whether collateral_estoppel was itself properly applied we are presented with a question of law that we review without deference to the district_court

b
we begin by stating the incontestable
the test of obviousness vel non is statutory and requires comparison of the claimed invention to the relevant prior_art
35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a 2000 ; in re ochiai 71_f.3d_1565 1569 37_uspq2d_1127 1131 fed.cir.1995
as the district_court recognized in its initial ruling there are no per se rules relating the patentability of product and process in either direction
ochiai 71 f.3d at 1571-72 37 uspq2d at 1132-33
a process yielding a novel and nonobvious product may nonetheless be obvious ; conversely a process yielding a well-known product may yet be nonobvious

of course if torpharm had more than one year before the filing of the application for the ¡¬671_patent sold improved form 1 ranitidine made by the claimed process then its process_claims would be invalid under section 102 b -regardless of whether the process was disclosed to the public or not
d.l
auld co. v. chroma graphics corp. 714_f.2d_1144 1147-48 219_uspq_13 15-16 fed.cir.1983
in contrast if the product were sold by one other than the patentee and the process of making remained unknown then sale of the product would not pose a statutory bar to a claim on the process
w.l
gore & assocs. inc. v. garlock inc. 721_f.2d_1540 1550 220_uspq_303 310 fed.cir.1983 ; d.l
auld 714 f.2d at 1147 219 uspq at 16
here not only was the form 1 ranitidine sold by one other than the patentee interchem but there is also no evidence of the process used to make the material that was sold

nonetheless the form 1 ranitidine sold by interchem in 1992 is technical` prior_art' against torpharms process_claims` if a device was in public use or on sale before the critical date then that device becomes a reference under section 103 against the claimed invention'
baker oil tools inc. v. geo vann inc. 828_f.2d_1558 1563 4_uspq2d_1210 1213 fed.cir.1987
the analysis is the same whether one regards this principle as an application of the on-sale bar or an application of the law of nonobviousness for which reason it has been termed the` ¡±¡± 102 b /103' bar to patentability
in re corcoran 640_f.2d_1331 1333 208_uspq_867 869 ccpa 1981
the courts task upon such a challenge is to determine whether` the claimed invention would have been obvious from the on-sale device in conjunction with the prior_art'
labounty mfg. inc. v. united states int l trade comm n 958_f.2d_1066 1071 22_uspq2d_1025 1028 fed.cir.1992
for the case at bar this inquiry would require the district_court to determine whether the form 1 ranitidine of uncertain genesis sold in 1992 in conjunction with the prior_art rendered obvious torpharms claimed process of crystallizing improved form 1 ranitidine from a three- or four-carbon_alcohol_solvent.4 we *1328 infer from the district_courts initial denial of summary_judgment that the court viewed this question as raising disputes of fact at least at this stage of the proceedings

c. while ranbaxy acknowledges these general principles ranbaxy argues and so convinced the district_court that here the prosecution_history of the ¡¬ 671 patent obviates the need to conduct a full-scale obviousness inquiry once the lack of novelty of the product is conceded
according to ranbaxy torpharm argued that the process was nonobvious based on the novelty of improved form 1 ranitidine and the examiner allowed the claim only because the product was novel as shown by his demand that torpharm amend the process_claim to explicitly recite the bulk and tap_densities defining improved form 1 ranitidine
therefore argues ranbaxy if improved form 1 ranitidine is not actually novel torpharms claimed process must be obvious
the district_court agreed with ranbaxy holding that torpharm was now estopped from arguing that anything other than the novelty of form 1 ranitidine supports the nonobviousness of its claims
we must reject ranbaxys position however for it suffers from three serious deficiencies

the first deficiency is factual
we do not agree with ranbaxys characterization of the prosecution_history
as filed torpharms original claims recited a process for` recovering the improved form of form 1 ranitidine_hydrochloride' without reciting the properties of the improved form
the claims did require that the process comprise` at least one alkanol solvent having 3-4 carbon_atoms'
these claims were initially rejected as anticipated or obvious in light of references disclosing crystallization of form 1 or form 2 ranitidine from alcohol_solvents
the examiner noted a that the claims did not distinguish the` improved' form 1 ranitidine from the form 1 and form 2 known in the prior_art and b the prior_art taught crystallization of ranitidine from the same solvents recited by the claims.5

torpharm did not significantly amend the claims in response
however torpharm provided a copy of the just-allowed ¡¬423_patent and stated that its novel form 1 ranitidine as disclosed in the ¡¬423_patent overcame the deficiencies of the prior_art_form 1 ranitidine because it was` a hard dense crystal' i.e. with higher density
torpharm also stated the method for achieving this result.. was based on the process which substitutes the methanol [ a one-carbon_solvent ] in united_states_patent 4,128,658 [ glaxos original form 1 ranitidine patent ] by using an alkanol having 3-4 carbon_atoms
as stated by the pct examiner nothing in the prior_art including united_states_patent 4,128,658 suggest [ sic ] to replace methanol in the preparation_process by any other alkanol
thus no person skilled in the art would replace the solvent in the preparation_process and would not all expect the ranitidine_hydrochloride product to have a higher bulk and tap_density
in other words torpharm argued that it would not have been obvious to use a three-carbon or four-carbon_alcohol_solvent *1329 in place of the one-carbon_solvent used to crystallize form 1 ranitidine in the prior_art

while torpharm also stated during prosecution that` [ b ] ecause the product is not obvious the process can not be obvious' 6 we agree with torpharm that torpharm advanced two distinct arguments during prosecution a that the product was novel and advantageous over the prior_art_form 1 ranitidine ; and b that there was no suggestion in the prior_art to use alcohol_solvents with three or four carbon_atoms in preparing form 1 ranitidine
thus it is incorrect to characterize torpharms argument for nonobviousness during prosecution as relying exclusively on the novelty of improved form 1 ranitidine

the second problem in ranbaxys argument is purely logical
even if torpharm had advanced during prosecution only the first of the two propositions recited above the subsequent_negation of that proposition by the north_carolina_decision would not necessarily negate the patentability of the ¡¬471 process
torpharm is said to have relied on essentially the following relation during prosecutionif the product is patentable over the prior_art then the process is patentable over the prior_art
it may now be established by the north_carolina_district_courts decision that the product is not in fact patentable over the prior_art
but this does not lead to the conclusion that the process is not patentable
the process may or may not be patentable for other reasons
ranbaxy in arguing that the process is patentable only if the product is patentable simply urges the logical fallacy of denying the antecedent.7

the third flaw in ranbaxys argument is a legal one
even assuming the examiner allowed the process_claims only because the product was novel it does not necessarily follow that the patent must be invalid
ranbaxy claims that the choice-of-solvent_argument did not persuade the examiner arguing that the examiner would not have required amendments reciting the ¡¬423 product limitations the bulk and tap_densities had he been persuaded by the solvent_argument
we are skeptical of this claim
when a patentee argues that her claims are nonobvious because process x yields product y it is not surprising that an examiner might require the claims to recite the properties of both x and y
but the nonobviousness_inquiry does not turn on speculation about what a particular_examiner thought or what that examiner might have done had the facts been otherwise
of course an examiners reasoning and findings are highly relevant to the validity inquiry but they are not beyond challenge and they do not in every case automatically preclude the existence of a dispute of material fact
certainly the examiners allowance of a claim is nonetheless subject to courtroom challenge by an accused infringer
the examiners reasons for allowance are not beyond challenge

a patentee of course may not recapture during litigation subject matter that was ultimately rejected as unpatentable during prosecution nor may the patentee adopt a position contradictory to that adopted before the pto and expect to be believed
but where the factual bases of an examiners decision to allow a claim have been undermined-as in other cases where prior_art not before the examiner is brought to light during litigation-a courts responsibility is not to speculate what a particular_examiner would or would not have done in light of the new information *1330 but rather to assess independently the validity of the claim against the prior_art under section 102 or section 103
such determination must take into account the statutory presumption of patent validity
stratoflex inc. v. aeroquip corp. 713_f.2d_1530 1534 218_uspq_871 875-76 fed.cir.1983
we therefore conclude that regardless of how the prosecution_history is characterized collateral_estoppel from the north_carolina_decision does not extend so far as to relieve the district_court from the necessity of performing a standard nonobviousness_inquiry

d. ranbaxy nonetheless maintains that the nonobviousness_inquiry is here foreclosed due to torpharms` acquiescence' in the examiners section 103 rejection during prosecution
the examiner rejected the pending claims as obvious over glaxos patent disclosing form 1 ranitidine but agreed that amending the claims to recite the bulk and tap_densities of improved form 1 ranitidine would overcome this rejection
according to ranbaxy having agreed to amend the pending claims rather than argue that the process was patentable without any density_limitations torpharm is precluded from contesting the obviousness of the process_claims now that material with the recited densities is known from the prior_art
ranbaxy suggests that this result follows from the supreme_courts decision in graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966) and from our own decision in lemelson v. general_mills inc. 968_f.2d_1202 23_uspq2d_1284_(fed.cir.1992)

however ranbaxys argument blurs the distinction between claims and limitations patentability is assessed for the former not the latter
that a particular limitation recited by a claim may be found in the prior_art is surely relevant to the patentability of the claim but it is hardly dispositive
here by amending its claim to recite the bulk and tap_densities of improved form 1 ranitidine torpharm` acquiesced' if at all only to the proposition that a process_claim lacking the density_limitations would not be distinguished from the prior_art
but torpharm is not here arguing that a process free of those limitations is patentable

moreover ranbaxys attempt to invoke an` acquiescence' rationale misreads the theory of our cases
a patentee is not required to fight tooth and nail every possibly adverse thought an examiner commits to paper nor to advance redundant arguments for patentability
whether the patentee chooses to dispute the examiners view of matters is relevant to claim interpretation for there a court may need to ascertain exactly what subject matter was actually examined and allowed by the pto
patent examination would serve little purpose unless the scope of the exclusive patent right correlated with the matter allowed by the pto
accordingly in ascertaining the scope of an issued patent the public is entitled to equate an inventors acquiescence to the examiners narrow view of patentable subject matter with abandonment of the rest
such acquiescence may be found where the patentee narrows his or her claims by amendment lemelson 968 f.2d at 1207-08 23 uspq2d at 1288-89 or lets stand an examiners restrictive interpretation of a claim elkay mfg co. v. ebco mfg co. 192_f.3d_973 978-79 52_uspq2d_1109 1112-14 fed.cir.1999
but these principles do not suggest that a patentee may advance during litigation only those arguments in support of patentability that were made before the patent office nor that the negation of an argument advanced during prosecution necessarily negates patentability as well

*1331 this misconception underlies ranbaxys reading of the supreme_courts decision in graham v. john deere
looking to the calmar v. cook chemical portion of the supreme_courts opinion in which the court analyzed the nonobviousness of claims to spray_bottles ranbaxy directs our attention to the courts discussion of prosecution_history
the court there explained that the patentee having failed to win allowance of claims free of limitations concerning the spray_bottles sealing arrangement could not now assert` a broader view' of the claimed invention
graham 383 u.s. at 33-34 86_s.ct._684
subsequently the court found the patented invention obvious because the sealing elements were present in prior_art spray_bottles.8 id.at 34-35 86_s.ct._684
but this discussion provides no support for ranbaxys position because the patentees narrowing of his claims in graham was not the point on which the obviousness determination depended
indeed if the claims had not recited the sealing elements added to distinguish the claims from the prior_art then their obviousness would have been a foregone conclusion
the relevance of prosecution_history in graham was to a preliminary dispute over claim construction
before deciding the obviousness question the graham_court had to decide whether the invention should be defined by various unclaimed features and advantages asserted by the patentee or by the explicit_limitations recited by the claims
id.at 29 86_s.ct._684
the court not surprisingly chose the latter and relied on the prosecution_history to define the scope of the claims
thus graham stands for the unexceptional proposition that nonobviousness is assessed by reference to the claimed invention and not by reference to properties that can not ultimately be derived from the claims
see constant v. advanced micro-devices inc. 848_f.2d_1560 1571-72 7_uspq2d_1057 1064-65 fed.cir.19889

although ranbaxys acquiescence argument thus fails we do not mean to say that an acquiescence_theory may never be invoked in the patentability inquiry
the circumstances in which such a theory might succeed are not before us and they better await another day for explication and decision

conclusion
we find that nothing in the prosecution_history of the ¡¬671_patent overcomes the statutory mandate to assess the nonobviousness of an issued patent_claim against the prior_art
accordingly the district_court was correct in its initial assessment that the ¡¬671_process_claims may be nonobvious despite the apparent lack of novelty of improved form 1 ranitidine
we therefore reverse the district_courts grant of summary_judgment of invalidity to ranbaxy *1332 and remand the case to the district_court for further_proceedings

reversed and remanded

8
the graham_courts exclusive focus on the sealing rib and overcap limitations was a function of the prior_art rather than legal doctrine
the claim in graham was to a spray_bottle with those elements and the prior_art disclosed spray_bottles with similar features
here the claim is to a process to make a product having certain density_limitations
the prior_art discloses products with such densities but not processes yielding materials with those densities

nor does lemelson v. general_mills support ranbaxys acquiescence_theory

but the issue in lemelson again was claim interpretation
