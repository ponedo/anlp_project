the301_patent covers fiberglass encasements which protect concrete bridge piles from water erosion

background
appellants principal douglas fox invented the301_patent ed subject matter
the prosecution history of the301_patent includes an original application filed april_27,_1971 and three continuing applications filed march 1973 july 1974 and october 1975
walter finch the attorney who filed the 1971_and_1973 applications left appellants employ in 1974
appellant retained new patent counsel edward levy to continue the prosecution
during prosecution of the301 predecessor applications appellant amended claims to describe the flexibility of the fiberglass jacket
finch admitted during trial that the original 1971 application did not disclose jacket flexibility
this characteristic therefore constituted new matter
the pto eventually rejected all claims in the 1971_and_1973 applications
the district_court concluded that the earliest filing date for the invention as claimed was march_5,_1973

more than one year prior to the march_5,_1973 filing date douglas fox published a sales brochure entitled fx-70 structural fiberglass system june 1971 brochure
finch used this brochure as source material in drafting the 1973 application
the district_court found that the brochure teaches every feature specified in the claims of the301_patent except one limitation in claim 10
the court further found that the brochure was more relevant than any other single reference cited during prosecution
appellant did not disclose the brochure to the pto during prosecution of the four applications leading to the301_patent

discussion
inequitable conduct
this court reviews inequitable_conduct under an abuse of discretion standard
kingsdown medical consultants ltd. v. hollister inc. 863_f.2d_867 876 9_uspq2d_1384 1392 fed.cir.1988
the district_court did not abuse its discretion in finding inequitable_conduct
a party may show inequitable_conduct by producing clear and convincing evidence of 1 material prior_art ; 2 knowledge chargeable to the patent applicant of prior_art and its materiality ; and 3 applicants failure to disclose the prior_art to the pto with intent to mislead
fmc corp. v. manitowoc co. 835_f.2d_1411 1415 5_uspq2d_1112 1115 fed.cir.1987
information is material if a` substantial likelihood [ exists ] that a reasonable examiner would consider it important in deciding whether to allow the application to issue as a patent'
j.p. stevens & co. v. lex tex ltd. 747_f.2d_1553 1559 223_uspq_1089 1092 fed.cir.1984 ; 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 1983

appellant cites kimberly-clark corp. v. johnson & johnson 745_f.2d_1437 1457 223_uspq_603 616 fed.cir.1984 for the proposition that this court determines materiality and intent only on the basis of allowed claims
appellant argues that finch who drafted claims which the pto rejected alone intended to mislead
therefore according to appellant because the inequitable_conduct pertains only to rejected claims the trial_court may enforce the301_patents claims
this court disagrees
appellant excerpts too little and makes too much of the statement in kimberly-clark
in that case the non-disclosed prior_art was not material to the allowed claims
such is not the case here

the duty of candor extends throughout the patents entire prosecution history
in determining inequitable_conduct a trial_court may look beyond the final claims to their antecedents
`` claims are not born and do not live in isolation
*804 each is related to other claims to the specification and drawings.. [ and ] to earlier or later versions of itself in light of amendments made to it'
kingsdown 863 f.2d at 874 9 uspq2d at 1390 footnote omitted
therefore a breach of the duty of candor early in the prosecution may render unenforceable all claims which eventually issue from the same or a related application

the record supports the trial_courts findings that finch knew that the fx-70_brochure was material and withheld it from the pto with intent to deceive
finch had an obligation to disclose the brochure to the pto notwithstanding the fact that none of the claims issued in the form in which he drafted them
a fortuitous rejection does not cure a breach of the duty of candor
driscoll v. cebalo 731_f.2d_878 885 221_uspq_745 751 fed.cir.1984
nothing in kimberly-clark requires the contrary

moreover the brochure discloses the entirety of the structure set forth in most of the issued claims
the trial_court held eight of the twelve claims of the301_patent invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b in light of the brochure
a finding that a withheld reference anticipates a claim in a patent satisfies the most stringent standard of materiality
see gardco mfg. inc. v. herst lighting co. 820_f.2d_1209 1214 2_uspq2d_2015 2019 fed.cir.1987

appellant also argues that rule 56 does not govern finchs duty of candor because the rule was promulgated after his involvement with the applications ceased
this argument lacks merit
in 1977 the pto clarified that rule 56 merely` codifie [ d ] the existing office policy on fraud and inequitable_conduct which is believed consistent with the prevailing case law in the federal courts'
42_fed.reg._5588 5,589 jan._28,_1977
see also in re jerabek 789_f.2d_886 890_n._10 229_uspq_530 533_n._10_(fed.cir.1986)
in any event the prevailing 1971-74 standards of inequitable_conduct would have required disclosure of the fx-70_brochure
see norton v. curtiss 433_f.2d_779 792-97 57_ccpa_1384 167_uspq_532 542-47 1970

fox himself owed the same duty of candor to the pto as did finch
fox participated in the prosecution from the original 1971 application through the successful 1975 application
throughout this period fox the author of the brochure knew of this extremely material document
the duty of candor rests on` the inventor.. and on every other individual who is substantively involved in the preparation or prosecution of the application..' 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 a
the trial_court determined that appellant with intent to mislead withheld the brochure
finchs testimony fully supports this finding

nothing in the record convinces us that the trial_courts findings are clearly erroneous
the record contains no evidence of good faith
further this court detects no abuse of discretion in the district_courts balance of materiality and intent in concluding appellant breached its duty of candor

attorney fees
under 35 u.s.c.¡± 285 1986 the trial_court awarded attorney_fees to appellee
section 285 provides that the` court in exceptional circumstances may award reasonable attorney_fees to the prevailing party'
inequitable conduct during prosecution of a patent may render an infringement suit exceptional
see mathis v. spears 857_f.2d_749 8_uspq2d_1551_(fed.cir.1988)
in light of appellants conduct in procurement of the301_patent this court finds no abuse of discretion in the trial_courts assessment of attorney_fees
moreover the district_court correctly calculated post-judgment interest from the date of the judgment establishing the right to the award
see id.at 760 8 uspq2d at 1559-60

conclusion
because the301_patent is unenforceable this court need not address foxs infringement contentions
further in light of the inequitable_conduct this court need not reach the district_courts misuse conclusion
the maryland_district_court correctly applied *805 the patent statute and appropriately assessed attorney_fees and costs
therefore the district_courts judgment is

affirmed
