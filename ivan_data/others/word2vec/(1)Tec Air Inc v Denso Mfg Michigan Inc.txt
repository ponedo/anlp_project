background
tec_air inc.` tec_air' owns u.s. patent nos._4047 692_and_4107,257` the swin_patents' both of which have effective filing dates of september 24 1975
the swin_patents describe a method of and a device for making properly balanced injected-molded fans
one way to balance a plastic fan is to use balance` pads'` lugs' or` plugs' which are deposits of plastic located in appropriate places on the fan
to create these lugs a hollow column is formed in a steel fan mold which fills with molten_plastic during the injection-molding process
when tec_air entered the fan molding business in 1972 like other manufacturers it used several_methods of creating these columns such as grinding or drilling holes in mold_inserts and refilling them if needed
a mold_insert forms a portion of the overall fan
tec_air also inserted replaceable brass rods into hollowed-out sections of the mold_insert which are drilled more easily because brass is a softer metal than steel the` brass_plug_method'
in june 1974 tec_airs employee richard swin sr. conceived the method disclosed in the swin_patents-inserting adjustable_screws into hollowed-out sections of the mold_insert that is used to form the fan hub
these screws are accessible from the front or cavity-side of the mold

throughout the development of the claimed invention tec_air continued to market its fans and fan molds
for example in june 1974 tec_air offered to sell keeprite products` keeprite' injected- *1357 molded fans and the corresponding mold
keeprite placed an order in july 1974 and tec_air created drawings for the keeprite_fan
one drawing dated august 16 1974 shows` balance_plugs' on the fan but does not specify the method of creating them
before september 24 1974 tec_air asked its mold maker jack dearhammer at mid city tool & die to quote it a price for making a mold_insert for the keeprite_fan
the sketch used for this price quotation did not show balance_plugs but dearhammer ultimately made the mold_insert capable of producing balance_plugs by inserting adjustable_screws into hollowed-out sections of the mold
in another attempt to solicit business tec_air sent sample fans to howard_industries on august 14 1974
these fans were model number 4b-60-21
on august 13 1974 dearhammer returned to tec_air the mold_insert used to make the 4b-60-21 fan after he had modified it to include the patented_inventions adjustable_screws
prior to sending the mold to dearhammer however tec_air accumulated thousands of the 4b-60-21 fans in its inventory which were made by prior_art balancing techniques

in 1991 tec_air sued denso for infringement because it manufactured radiator and condenser_assemblies that included a fan that was balanced according to the claimed method
tec_air won the infringement phase of the trifurcated trial which denso does not appeal
a jury then heard the invalidity phase of the suit in which denso argued that the patents are invalid because tec_air offered the invention for sale more than one year before the effective filing date and because the invention of the claims would have been obvious
the jury returned special_interrogatories indicating that tec_air neither sold nor offered the invention for sale before the critical_date and that the patented_invention would not have been obvious
the same jury subsequently awarded damages of $ 25.2 million which corresponds to a royalty of 6.5 % of the infringing sales of densos entire radiator and condenser_assemblies but is nevertheless less than the royalty requested by tec_air
denso moved for judgment as a matter of law or alternatively for a new_trial on the validity and damages_issues

the court denied the motion for judgment as a matter of law because although the evidence showed that tec_air possessed mold_inserts having adjustable_screws before the critical_date there was evidence that tec_air did not use these inserts to create commercial products
in addition the court determined not only that denso failed to establish a prima_facie_case of obviousness for lack of a suggestion to combine the cited references but also that tec_air produced sufficient_objective_evidence of nonobviousness
the court also held that the jury properly used the entire_market_value_rule in measuring damages because each denso assembly was a single functioning unit which included the infringing fan
the court then denied densos motion for a new_trial because the evidence was sufficient to support the invalidity verdict and the damage award was neither excessive nor the product of improper considerations
this appeal followed

discussion
`` we review a trial_courts decision on a motion for judgment as a matter of law following a jury verdict by reapplying its own standard of review
therefore for [ denso ] to prevail on appeal it must prove that the jurys factual findings were not supported by substantial_evidence or that the facts were not sufficient to support the conclusions necessarily drawn by the jury on the way to its verdict'
applied med resources corp. v. united states surgical corp. 147_f.3d_1374 1376 47_uspq2d_1289 1290 fed.cir.1998 citations omitted
in evaluating whether denso met this standard` we must consider the evidence of record in the light most favorable to [ tec_air ] drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor without disturbing the jurys credibility *1358 determinations or substituting our resolutions of conflicting evidence for those of the jury'
id.at 1376-77 47 uspq2d at 1291
if no reasonable person could have reached a verdict for tec_air in light of the record before the jury denso will prevail

on-sale bar
`` the ultimate determination that a product was placed on sale under [ 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b 1994 ] is a question of law based on underlying facts'
ferag ag v. quipp inc. 45_f.3d_1562 1566 33_uspq2d_1512 1514-15 fed.cir.1995
to prove that the swin_patents are invalid for violating the on-sale_bar denso` must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that there was a definite sale or offer to sell more than one year before the application for the subject patent and that the subject_matter of the sale or offer to sell fully anticipated the claimed invention or would have rendered the claimed invention obvious by its addition to the prior_art'
id
( internal_quotations omitted ; see also pfaff v. wells elecs. inc. 525_u.s._55 119_s.ct._304 311 142_l.ed.2d_261_(1998)` first the product must be the subject of a commercial_offer for sale

if this subject_matter anticipates the claimed invention or would have rendered it obvious the invention itself must also have been` ready for patenting' at the time of the offer or sale-e.g. the invention must have been reduced to practice or embodied in` drawings or other descriptions.. that [ are ] sufficiently specific to enable a person skilled in the art to practice the invention'
pfaff 119 s.ct.at 312

denso claims that tec_air offered the invention for sale on june_26,_1974 to keeprite and on august 14 1974 to howard_industries both prior to the critical_date of september 24 1974
according to tec_air although it ultimately shipped fans made according to the invention to these customers it did not specify the balancing technique in its offers and it did not intend to use the patented_one when it made the offers
viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to tec_air we hold that the jury reasonably could have found that tec_airs offers to keeprite and howard_industries did not raise the on-sale_bar because the subject_matter of these offers does not fully anticipate the claimed invention and denso does not argue that it would have rendered the invention obvious

denso argues that no reasonable_jury could have found that the reference to` balance_plugs' on the august 16 1974 drawing for the keeprite_fan meant anything other than balance_plugs made according to the swin_patents because the mold was ultimately made with adjustable_screws
the drawing itself sheds no light on the method of making the fan
to buttress its claim therefore denso cites dearhammers testimony that he thought the notation referred to adjustable_screws and that tec_air employees called the adjustable_screws` balance_plugs'
tec_airs employee richard swin jr. testified however that the plastic lugs formed on the fan blade are called` balance_plugs' regardless of the method used to create them
he also testified that tec_air intended to use the brass_plug_method to balance the keeprite_fan when it made the august 1974 drawing and did not tell dearhammer that adjustable_screws would be used until october 29 1974 when it sent him specifications for the first time
dearhammer admitted that the sketch he used to quote a price for the keeprite mold did not show adjustable_screws
in light of this evidence the jury reasonably could have found that tec_air did not offer *1359 the patented_invention for sale to keeprite before the critical_date

denso stresses that the august 1974 drawing shows that the invention was ready for patenting thus satisfying the second_prong of pfaff
see 119 s.ct.at 312
however because the offer for sale did not involve subject_matter that either anticipates the invention or would have rendered it obvious pfaffs second_prong is irrelevant
pfaff did not remove the requirement that the subject_matter of the commercial_offer for sale` be something within the scope of the claim'
scaltech 178 f.3d at 1383 51 uspq2d at 1058
accordingly densos reliance on pfaff does not have the talismanic effect it desires

denso also argues that no reasonable_jury could have found that the samples sent to howard_industries with the august 14 1974 offer letter were not made pursuant to the swin_patents because tec_air received the modified mold the day before
it also claims that the sent fans must have had balance_lugs made according to the patents because howard_industries sent a letter in january 1975 asking tec_air to move the` balancing lugs' on the 4b-60-21 fan
tec_air argues that the jury reasonably could have found that the samples were made before august 13 1974 because it had thousands of 4b-60-21 fans in inventory before it sent the mold to mid city
swin jr. testified that he selected the 4b-60-21 fan mold_insert to be modified in part because tec_air had a sufficient inventory of 4b-60-21 fans that it could ship while he tested the modified mold
because balance_lugs can be formed by several_methods the january 1975 letter does not indisputably show that tec_air made the sent fans with the modified mold
swin jr. testified furthermore that he did not make any fans from the modified mold until september 1974
densos argument relies on an inference that tec_air immediately ran samples from the modified mold despite swin jr.s testimony to the contrary
although swin jr. was an interested witness the jury could have reasonably believed him in light of the large number of 4b-60-21 fans available in tec_airs inventory
therefore the court did not err in denying densos motion for judgment as a matter of law on the issue of validity under section 102 b

obviousness
`` obviousness under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 [ 1994 ] is a legal_conclusion based on factual evidence' which we review` for correctness or error as a matter of law'
in re fine 837_f.2d_1071 1073 5_uspq2d_1596 1598 fed.cir.1988 internal_quotations omitted
these factual underpinnings include what a prior_art reference teaches whether a reference provides a motivation to combine its teachings with others see in re beattie 974_f.2d_1309 1311 24_uspq2d_1040 1041-42 fed.cir.1992 whether the invention experienced commercial_success and whether it satisfied a long-felt but unmet_need see c.r
bard inc. v. m3 sys. inc. 157_f.3d_1340 1351 48_uspq2d_1225 1231 fed.cir.1998

in reviewing` a jury special verdict on patent claim obviousness where the underlying facts have been disputed [ ].. [ w ] e first presume that the jury resolved the underlying factual disputes in favor of the verdict winner and leave those presumed findings undisturbed if they are supported by substantial_evidence
then we examine the legal_conclusion de novo to see whether it is correct in light of the presumed jury fact findings'
jurgens v. mckasy 927_f.2d_1552 1557 18_uspq2d_1031 1035 fed.cir.1991 citations omitted
the same rule also applies to special_interrogatories

to establish a prima_facie_case of obviousness denso must show` some objective teaching in the prior_art or that knowledge generally available to one of ordinary_skill in the art would lead that individual to combine the relevant teachings of the references'
*1360 fine 837 f.2d at 1074 5 uspq2d at 1598
there is no suggestion to combine however if a reference teaches away from its combination with another source
see id.at 1075 5 uspq2d at 1599
`` a reference may be said to teach away when a person of ordinary_skill upon reading the reference would be discouraged from following the path set out in the reference or would be led in a direction divergent from the path that was taken by the applicant.. [ or ] if it suggests that the line of development flowing from the references disclosure is unlikely to be productive of the result sought by the applicant'
in re gurley 27_f.3d_551 553 31_uspq2d_1130 1131 fed.cir.1994
if when combined the references` would produce a seemingly inoperative device' then they teach away from their combination
in re sponnoble 56_c.c.p.a._823 405_f.2d_578 587 160_uspq_237 244 1969 ; see also in re gordon 733_f.2d_900 902 221_uspq_1125 1127 fed.cir.1984 finding no suggestion to modify a prior_art device where the modification would render the device inoperable for its intended_purpose

denso argues that the court should have granted its motion for judgment as a matter of law because the invention of the claims would have been obvious over u.s. patent no._3136,001` the gelbard_patent' in combination with the brass_plug_method
although tec_air disclosed the gelbard_patent to the patent and trademark office during prosecution of the swin_patents the details of the brass_plug_method were not before the examiner
the gelbard_patent teaches using adjustable_screws to create balance_lugs on the blade tips of a molded fan
unlike the screws of the swin_patents these screws are accessible from the rear of the mold

because in the brass_plug_method the operator drills the brass_plugs from the cavity-side of the mold combining this method with the teachings of the gelbard_patent results in cavity-side accessible screws
the gelbard_patent teaches however that each of its adjustable threaded members has` a non-threaded or smooth tip extending into a recess' which comes into contact with the molten_plastic
col._1,_ll._64-67
this teaching is consistent with the conventional wisdom as late as 1974 which counseled against arranging screw heads to face the cavity-side of the mold because molten_plastic would 1 enter the screw slot which would be difficult to remove and 2 likely seep behind the screw head and jam the screw according to tec_airs expert dr._williamson
because the brass_plugs-gelbard_patent combination would be inoperable for its intended_purpose-no screw driver would be able to turn the smooth-headed screws from the cavity-side of the mold-the jury reasonably could have found that the gelbard_patent taught away from its combination with the brass_plug_method

alternatively even assuming that denso established a prima_facie_case of obviousness tec_air presented sufficient_objective_evidence of nonobviousness to rebut it
`` [ o ] bjective evidence of non-obviousness may be used to rebut a prima_facie_case of obviousness based on prior_art references'
wms gaming inc. v. international game tech. 184_f.3d_1339 1359 51_uspq2d_1385 1400 fed.cir.1999
this type of evidence` may include commercial_success [ and ] long-felt but unsolved need'
id
`` whether the evidence presented suffices to rebut the prima_facie_case is part of the ultimate conclusion of obviousness and is therefore a question of law'
in re rouffet 149_f.3d_1350 1355 47_uspq2d_1453 1456 fed.cir.1998

according to the trial_court tec_air presented evidence that millions of fans were sold by both tec_air and denso and that the patented_method eliminated the` tedious haphazard and expensive process of drilling the surface of the mold cavity'
based on tec_airs sales_evidence the jury reasonably could have found that the invention enjoyed commercial_success
denso argues that this evidence *1361 is insufficient because tec_air failed to provide market share data
although sales_figures coupled with market data provide stronger evidence of commercial_success sales_figures alone are also evidence of commercial_success
see cable elec prods. inc. v. genmark inc. 770_f.2d_1015 1027 226_uspq_881 888 fed.cir.1985` [ i ] nformation [ about market share ] might bolster the existence in fact of any commercial_success.. demonstrated by [ mere sales data ]..' overruled on other grounds by midwest indus. inc. v. karavan trailers inc. 175_f.3d_1356 1358-61 50_uspq2d_1672 1674-76 fed.cir.1999 en banc ; see also in re huang 100_f.3d_135 140 40_uspq2d_1685 1689 fed.cir.1996` this court has noted in the past that evidence related solely to the number of units sold provides a very weak showing of commercial_success if any
`` ; see e.g. gambro lundia ab v. baxter healthcare corp. 110_f.3d_1573 1579 42_uspq2d_1378 1384 fed.cir.1997` [ t ] he record contains significant evidence of the commercial_success of [ the ] invention
the record shows that [ a competitor ] sold over 14,800 dialysis machines allegedly incorporating the [ claimed ] invention since 1987

denso also argues that tec_air failed to show a nexus between the sales and the patented_invention
`` a prima_facie_case of nexus is generally made out when the patentee shows both that there is commercial_success and that the thing product or method that is commercially successful is the invention disclosed and claimed in the patent'
demaco corp. v. f. von langsdorff licensing ltd. 851_f.2d_1387 1392 7_uspq2d_1222 1226 fed.cir.1988
the evidence shows that tec_air sold approximately two million fans per month all of which were made according to the patented_method
see akzo n.v. v. united states int l trade comm n 808_f.2d_1471 1481 1_uspq2d_1241 1246 fed.cir.1986 finding commercial_success where a product made by a patented_method was commercially successful

according to the trial_court tec_air also offered testimony that` there was a long-felt but unmet_need to create a more efficient method to achieve fan balance' prior to the swin_patents
swin sr. testified that tec_air used several unsatisfactory balancing techniques before adopting the patented_one
dr._williamson testified that the industry experienced problems with the prior_art machining methods
moreover after denso ceased infringing the swin_patents it had to resort to less effective methods of balancing the fans
based on this evidence the jury reasonably could have found there was a long-felt but unmet_need in the prior_art for an improved balancing method which the swin_patents satisfied

in light of this objective evidence of nonobviousness and the lack of evidence of a suggestion to combine the references the court properly denied densos motion for judgment as a matter of law on the obviousness issue

damages
in addition to arguing that the court should have granted its motion for judgment as a matter of law on the damages_issue denso argues that the court should have granted a new_trial on this issue
we review the trial_courts denial of a motion for a new_trial for abuse of discretion
see dmi inc. v. deere & co. 802_f.2d_421 427 231_uspq_276 280 fed.cir.1986
`` that question turns on whether an error occurred in the conduct of the trial that was so grievous as to have rendered the trial unfair'
id

*1362 the jury awarded damages based on the entire_market_value_rule` which permits recovery of damages based on the value of the entire apparatus containing several features where the patent related feature is the basis for customer_demand'
state indus. inc. v. mor-flo indus. inc. 883_f.2d_1573 1580 12_uspq2d_1026 1031 fed.cir.1989
the entire_market_value_rule is appropriate where both the patented and unpatented_components together are` analogous to components of a single assembly'` parts of a complete machine' or` constitute a functional unit' but not where the unpatented_components` have essentially no functional relationship to the patented_invention and.. may have been sold with an infringing device only as a matter of convenience or business advantage'
rite-hite corp. v. kelley co. 56_f.3d_1538 1550 35_uspq2d_1065 1073 fed.cir.1995 en banc

denso argues that the jury could not have reasonably found that 1 the patented and unpatented_components comprised a single_functional_unit and 2 the basis for the customer_demand was the method of balancing the fan inside the assembly
densos damage expert testified that the motors used with the radiator and condenser_assemblies required fans
denso did not sell these assemblies without fans
densos internal documents stress moreover that the performance and price of the entire system were paramount to its customers
this evidence amply supports the finding that the assemblies were a single_functional_unit
in addition the evidence shows that customers wanted fans that were balanced to a certain specification and once denso abandoned the patented_method it could not meet the 2.0 gm-cm balance specification
denso argues that its customers did not care how the fans in the assemblies were balanced
however after denso changed its specification one customer complained and required denso to rebalance the fans
from this evidence the jury could have reasonably concluded that the demand for the entire assembly depended on the patented_invention

thus the jury properly applied the entire_market_value_rule and denso failed to demonstrate that the trial_court legally erred in denying its motion for judgment as a matter of law or abused its discretion in declining to grant a new_trial on the damages_issue

conclusion
accordingly the judgment of united_states_district_court for the northern_district of illinois is affirmed
