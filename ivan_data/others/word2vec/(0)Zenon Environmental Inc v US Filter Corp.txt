united_states_filter_corp.` us_filter' appeals from the final_judgment of the united_states_district_court for the southern_district of california following a bench_trial that the asserted claims of u.s._patent 6,620,319` the ¡¬319_patent` are not invalid as anticipated under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102
zenon_environmental inc.` zenon' cross-appeals the district_courts grant of summary_judgment that the accused products do not infringe the ¡¬319_patent
because we conclude that the district_court erred in determining that the ¡¬ 319 patent was entitled to the priority_date of an earlier filed patent and thus clearly erred in concluding that the ¡¬319_patent was not anticipated by that patent we reverse the courts judgment of no invalidity and hold that patent to be invalid
in light of that conclusion we need not reach zenons cross-appeal seeking reversal of the district_courts grant of summary_judgment of noninfringement

background
zenon owns the ¡¬319_patent entitled` apparatus for withdrawing permeate using an immersed vertical skein of hollow [ fiber ] membranes'
the patent relates to the field of water treatment and filtration systems and is directed to` relatively large_systems for the microfiltration of liquids'
¡¬319_patent col.2 ll.47-48
the patent discloses the use of a vertical_skein which the patent describes as` an integrated combination of structural elements including i a multiplicity of vertical_fibers of substantially equal length ; ii a pair of headers in each of which are potted the opposed terminal portions of the fibers so as to leave their ends open ; and iii permeate_collection means held peripherally in fluid-tight engagement with each header so as to collect permeate from the ends of the fibers'
id.at_col.1_ll.31-38 emphases added

as disclosed in the patent a skein of hollow_fiber_membranes is submerged within the substrate i.e. the liquid feed containing the unwanted particulate_matter
the fibers filter the substrate using a process called an outside-in flow
id.at col.4 ll.30-33
during that process` [ t ] he feed of substrate is introduced externally of the fibers' which are made of porous or semipermeable materials and is` resolved intopermeate andconcentrate streams'
id
a permeate_collection means is used to collect permeate from the ends of the fibers
the ¡¬319_patent describes the importance of keeping the surface of the fibers free of particulate_matter which generally includes micron-sized and submicron-sized *1373 organic or inorganic matter id.at col.1 ll.46-53 in order to ensure the free flow of permeate over an extended period of time thereby reducing the frequency with which the fibers must be cleaned
id.at col.5 ll.46-56

in order to achieve that objective the patent discloses using` a cleansing_gas typically air discharged near the base of a skein to produce bubbles in a specified size range and in an amount large enough to scrub the fibers and to cause the fibers to scrub themselves against one another'
id.at col.2 ll.51-55
it is the` scrubbing force exerted by the bubbles on the fibers [ that ] keeps their surfaces sufficiently free of attached microorganisms and deposits of inanimate particles to provide a relatively high and stable flow of permeate over many weeks if not months of operation'
id.at col.5 ll.49-53
thus the ¡¬319_patent discloses that` the most preferred use of the skein as a membrane_device is in a bank in combination with a gas-distribution_means which is typically used to distribute air or oxygen-enriched air between the fibers from within the skein or between adjacent skeins at the bases thereof'
id.at col.7 ll.21-25
an illustration of a pair of skeins in combination with a gas-distribution_means is shown in figure 10 of the ¡¬ 319 patent

?
the pair of skeins 40_and_40 ¡¬ consists of upper and lower_headers 41 u and 41 u and 41 b and 41 b respectively vertical_fibers 42_and_42 ¡¬ and permeate_collection means 46u and 46b
the skeins share a common gas-distribution_means 50 which is preferably split into two arms 51_and_51 ¡¬
id.at col.25 ll.8-9
claims 7-12 are the asserted claims of the ¡¬319_patent
claim 7 the only independent asserted claim reads as follows 7
an apparatus for treating a multicomponent liquid substrate while leaving particulate_matter therein comprising a a non-pressurized reservoir for containing the substrate ; b a plurality of hollow fiber filtering membranes immersed in the substrate wherein the membranes are disposed generally vertically between upper and lower_headers such that i outsides of ends of the membranes are sealingly secured to the headers in a closely *1374 spaced apart_relationship ii lumens of the membranes are in fluid_communication with at least one permeate_collection means and iii said membranes having a length between opposed_surfaces of the headers such that the membranes may move against each other but wherein the length is less [ than ] 5 % greater than the distance between opposed_surfaces of the headers ; c a pump in fluid_communication with said lumens of said membranes said pump operable to apply a suction to the lumens of the membranes to draw a component of the substrate as permeate through said membranes ; and d a gas_distribution_system having through-passages through the lower_header to discharge bubbles into the substrate above the lower_header
¡¬319_patent claim 7 emphasis added
thus a particular type of gas-distribution_means viz. one that requires through-passages through the lower_header to discharge bubbles into the substrate above the lower_header is present in all of the asserted claims
figure 6 of the ¡¬319_patent depicts an example of that type of gas_distribution_means

?
figure 6 depicts a single_skein 110 in which air_tubes 103 traverse the integral header 101 with a thickness l1-l2
¡¬319_patent col.19 l.62-col.20 l.22
as seen from the illustration air passes through the air_tubes and escapes above the top surface of the header l2
the fibers 12 are secured in the header and are positioned above a permeate pan 120 which is used to collect permeate from the fibers
the ¡¬319_patent is the sixth patent to issue from a series of connected applications that were filed by the same assignee

'319_patent col.1 ll.8-18 emphases added
zenon asserts that the ¡¬319_patent is entitled to the priority_date of the ¡¬373_patent under 35 u.s.c.¡± 120.1

relevant to this appeal are the disclosures of the intervening patents.2 the ¡¬250_patent entitled` baffle for conversion of fine bubbles to coarse while filtering with a vertical skein of hollow fibers' is directed to a filtration_device` provided for withdrawing permeate essentially continuously from a multicomponent aqueous substrate containing growing microorganisms in a reservoir'
¡¬250_patent abstract
the ¡¬250_patent teaches` the utilization of bubbles of air in two size ranges one fine the other coarse defined below to accomplish different functions in the operation of a vertical_skein of hollow_fiber_membranes for filtration of an aqueous medium from a biomass'
id.at col.1 ll.12-16
the inventors discovered that very small or fine_bubbles were an efficient and economical means of providing` an oxygen-containing gas typically air or air enriched with oxygen occasionally pure oxygen required for growth of microorganisms in the aqueous substrate' id.at col.2 ll.3-11 in contrast to coarse_bubbles which are useful for maintaining` clean fiber surfaces during microfiltration mf or ultrafiltration uf with a skein'
id.at col.2 ll.1-3

in the summary of invention section of the ¡¬250_patent specification the patentees stated that it is.. a general object of this invention to provide a filtration_device for the separation of a liquid from a biomass containing live microorganisms requiring a gas typically oxygen for growth the device comprising a vertical_skein of fibers resting on a conversion_baffle disposed within a biomass contacted with fine_bubbles of the gas ; the conversion_baffle has through-openings which allow gas trapped under the baffle to be discharged as coarse_bubbles from a discharging zone near the surface of a gas-distribution supply line
id.at col.3 ll.32-42
an example of such a device is depicted in figure 4 of the ¡¬250_patent

*1376. ?
the device contains an air_supply_pipe 60 that is fitted with fine-bubble_generators 61 which produce fine_bubbles in the fine-bubble discharging zone 66
id.at col.1 ll.49-67
as the fine_bubbles travel upwards the bubbles collect in a trapping zone 48-a mass of air directly below the baffle 40 and above the surface of the substrate
the air then travels through the perforations 41 of the baffle 40 and is converted into coarse_bubbles in the coarse-bubble discharging zone 68
id
thus the filtration_device disclosed in the ¡¬250_patent differs from the filtration_device described in the ¡¬319_patent in that in addition to the use of a vertical_skein the invention of the ¡¬250_patent uses a conversion_baffle which enables fine_bubbles that are necessary for the oxygenation of microorganisms in the substrate to convert into coarse_bubbles as they pass through the baffle
notably however the inventors clarified in the ¡¬250_patent that the vertical_skein is not the subject_matter of this invention and any prior_art_vertical_skein may be used
further_details relating to the construction and deployment of a most preferred_skein are found in the parent_u.s._pat
no._5639,373 and in ser
no._08_/690,045 the relevant_disclosures of each of which are included by reference thereto as if fully set forth herein
id.at col.2 ll.30-36
thus the ¡¬250_patent specification purports to incorporate by reference the details relating to the construction and deployment of a vertical_skein as disclosed in the grandparent_patents
us_filter is one of zenons principal competitors in the water filtration industry
on october 3 2003 zenon brought suit against u.s._filter alleging that it infringed three of its patents viz. u.s._patent nos._6245,239` the ¡¬239_patent` 6,550,747` the ¡¬747_patent` and the ¡¬319_patent
in november 2004 following a *1377 markman hearing the court construed the disputed claim terms
after the court issued its claim_construction_ruling zenon conceded that the accused products did not infringe the asserted claims of the ¡¬319_patent
us_filter then moved for summary_judgment on the patents in suit which the court granted in part and denied in part
the court granted summary_judgment of noninfringement as to the ¡¬747_patent denied summary_judgment of noninfringement and invalidity as to the ¡¬239_patent and denied summary_judgment of invalidity as to the ¡¬319_patent

on april 27_and_28 2005 the court held a bench_trial on the validity of the ¡¬319_patent
at trial u.s._filter argued that the ¡¬319_patent was not entitled to claim priority from the ¡¬373_patent
in particular u.s._filter asserted that the intervening patents failed to incorporate by reference the gas_distribution_system disclosed in the ¡¬373_patent and thus broke the chain of priority because the asserted claims in the ¡¬319_patent were not supported by each patent in the family_chain-a requirement for entitlement to the benefit of the filing_date of an earlier_patent under 35 u.s.c.¡± 120
in light of the undisputed fact that the ¡¬373_patent contains each and every element of the claimed invention of the ¡¬319_patent u.s._filter argued that the ¡¬373_patent invalidated the ¡¬319_patent by reason of anticipation

on may_5,_2005 the district_court rejected u.s._filters assertion and concluded that u.s._filter failed to prove that the ¡¬319_patent was invalid by clear and convincing_evidence
us_filter subsequently moved for summary_judgment of noninfringement of the ¡¬319_patent which the court granted
the parties agreed to dismiss the remaining pending claims without prejudice and on january 17 2006 the court entered final_judgment on all of the asserted patents

us_filter timely appealed the courts decision with regard to the validity of the ¡¬319_patent
zenon cross-appealed the courts claim_construction_ruling and grant of summary_judgment of noninfringement
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

we review` the judgment of a district_court following a bench_trialfor errors of law and clearly erroneous findings of fact

hoover group inc. v. custom metalcraft inc. 66_f.3d_299 302 fed.cir.1995

a. validity of the ¡¬319_patent
on appeal u.s._filter argues that the district_court erred by applying the wrong legal standard with respect to the question whether the intervening patents incorporated by reference the gas_distribution_system disclosed in the ¡¬373_patent
in particular u.s._filter asserts that the district_court improperly placed the burden on u.s._filter to prove that the gas_distribution_system was not incorporated by reference in the intervening patents rather than placing the burden on zenon the drafter of the intervening patents to establish the incorporation by reference
us_filter further argues that the intervening patents do not describe the gas_distribution_system claimed in the ¡¬319_patent
instead according to u.s._filter the intervening patents claim an entirely new and different_gas_distribution_system
because the gas_distribution_system present in the asserted claims of the ¡¬319_patent is not *1378 supported by the intervening patents u.s._filter contends that those claims can not gain the benefit of the ¡¬373 priority_date
moreover u.s._filter argues that the incorporation by reference_language fails to meet the requirements that the language identify with detailed_particularity what material is being incorporated and where that material is located in the various_documents

in response zenon argues that the ¡¬319_patent is presumed valid under 35 u.s.c.¡± 282 and u.s._filter failed to satisfy its burden of overcoming that presumption
zenon further argues that the district_court correctly determined that the ¡¬319_patent is entitled to the priority_date of the ¡¬ 373 patent because a continuity of disclosure was maintained throughout the patent chain
according to zenon a person of ordinary_skill in the art would reasonably understand that the gas_distribution_system disclosed in the ¡¬373_patent is a detail that relates to the construction and deployment of a skein and thus was properly incorporated by reference in the intervening patents
zenon further contends that the incorporation by reference_language in the ¡¬ 250 patent meets the particularity and location requirements

we agree with u.s._filter that the district_court erred by concluding that the ¡¬319_patent is entitled to the priority_date of the ¡¬373_patent and thus clearly erred in concluding that the ¡¬319_patent was not anticipated by the ¡¬373_patent
we begin our analysis by focusing on 35 u.s.c.¡± 120 which governs entitlement to an earlier_filing_date in the united_states
that section provides that an application for patent for an invention disclosed in the manner provided by the first paragraph of section 112 of this title in an application previously filed in the united_states.. which is filed by an inventor or inventors named in the previously filed application shall have the same effect as to such invention as though filed on the date of the prior application [ ]
35 u.s.c.¡± 120
`` in order to gain the benefit of the filing_date of an earlier_application under 35 u.s.c.¡± 120 each application in the chain leading back to the earlier_application must comply with the written description requirement of 35 u.s.c.¡± 112'
lockwood v. am
airlines inc. 107_f.3d_1565 1571 fed.cir.1997 ; see also reiffin v. microsoft corp. 214_f.3d_1342 1346 fed.cir.2000 noting that` claims to subject_matter in a later-filed application not supported by an ancestor application in terms of ¡± 112 ?
1.. do not receive the benefit of the earlier_applications filing_date'
thus in order for the ¡¬319_patent to be entitled to priority from the ¡¬373_patent continuity of disclosure must have been maintained throughout a chain of patents from the ¡¬373_patent leading up to the ¡¬319_patent

incorporation by reference` provides a method for integrating material from various_documents into a host_document.. by citing such material in a manner that makes clear that the material is effectively part of the host_document as if it were explicitly contained therein'
cook_biotech_inc. v. acell inc. 460_f.3d_1365 1376 fed.cir.2006 quoting advanced_display sys. inc. v. kent state univ. 212_f.3d_1272 1282 fed.cir.2000
`` to incorporate material by reference the host_document must identify with detailed_particularity what specific material it incorporates and clearly indicate where that material is found in the various_documents'
id
( emphases added
whether material has been incorporated by reference into a host_document and the extent to which it has been incorporated is a question of law
cook 460 f.3d at 1376
in making that determination` the standard *1379 of one reasonably skilled in the art should be used to determine whether the host_document describes the material to be incorporated by reference with sufficient_particularity'
advanced_display 212 f.3d at 1282

we have previously described incorporation by reference and anticipation as separate inquiries
we have stated that` no necessary contradiction exists given that incorporation by reference is a question of law while anticipation is a question of fact'
id
we also clarified the courts role in situations in which both inquiries are at issue
we held that` if incorporation by reference comes into play in an anticipation_determination the courts role is to determine what material in addition to the host_document constitutes the single_reference
the factfinders role in turn is to determine whether that single_reference describes the claimed invention'
id

in the present_case u.s._filter asserted that the ¡¬319_patent was invalid by reason of anticipation and thus was required to prove by clear and convincing_evidence that each and every element of the claimed invention was described in ¡¬373_patent
id
those facts pertaining to the anticipation_determination however were largely undisputed by the parties
in the pre-trial order the parties stipulated that the ¡¬373_patent` discloses each and every element of the claims of the ¡¬319_patent'
thus the sole question before the district_court was whether the intervening patents maintained the continuity of disclosure by incorporating by reference the gas_distribution_system disclosed in the ¡¬373_patent entitling the ¡¬319_patent to an earlier_filing_date
in this respect the court was required to determine that question of law which we review de novo using the reasonable_person of ordinary_skill in the art standard
universal elecs inc. v. united_states 112_f.3d_488 493 fed.cir.1997` reviewing tribunals generally decide questions of law de novo because they are equally well suited to make such decisions'

based on our review of the record we disagree with the courts conclusion that the intervening patents incorporated by reference with sufficient_particularity to one reasonably skilled in the art the gas_distribution_system disclosed in the ¡¬373_patent
the incorporation by reference_language states that the vertical_skein is not the subject_matter of this invention and any prior_art_vertical_skein may be used
further_details relating to the construction and deployment of a most preferred_skein are found in the parent_u.s._pat
no._5639,373 and in ser
no._08_/690,045 the relevant_disclosures of each of which are included by reference thereto as if fully set forth herein
¡¬250_patent col.2 ll.30-36 emphases added
we are not persuaded by zenons assertion which the trial court accepted that that language incorporates by reference the entire disclosures of the ¡¬373 and ¡¬083_patent s. such an interpretation is inconsistent with the plain_language of the statement
the plain_language expressly limits the incorporation to only relevant_disclosures of the patents indicating that the disclosures are not being incorporated in their entirety
moreover the plain_language indicates that the subject_matter that is being incorporated by reference pertains to the details relating to the construction and deployment of a vertical_skein
thus we must look as one reasonably skilled in the art would to the grandparent_patents to determine what the patentees meant by details relating to the construction and deployment of a vertical_skein

we agree with u.s._filter that the gas_distribution_system disclosed in the ¡¬ *1380 373 patent is not a detail that relates to the construction and deployment of a vertical_skein
the ¡¬373_patent makes clear that the vertical_skein and the gas_distribution_system are two separate and distinct_elements of the claimed invention of the ¡¬373_patent
for example claim 10 of the ¡¬373_patent refers to the skein and gas_distribution_system as two separate elements 10
in a gas-scrubbed assembly_comprising a microfiltration membrane_device in combination with a gas-distribution_means.. * * * said fibers said headers and said permeate_collection means together forming a skein.. * * * said gas_distribution_means having through-passages therein to discharge a cleansing_gas.. ¡¬373_patent claim 10 emphases added
claims 1_to_9 of the ¡¬373_patent in addition claim a membrane_device that includes a vertical_skein but not a gas_distribution_system

turning to the written description the ¡¬373_patent expressly states that the vertical_skein consists of three distinct_elements viz. fibers a pair of headers and a permeate_collection means
id.at_col.1_ll.31-38
thus by definition a skein does not include a gas_distribution_system
in addition throughout the ¡¬373_patent the inventors used a specific term to describe the combination of a skein and a gas_distribution_means
for example the patent states that it has also been discovered that permeate may be [ efficiently ] withdrawn from a substrate for a surprisingly long period in a single stage essentially continuous filtration process by mounting a pair of headers in vertically spaced apart_relationship one above another within the substrate which directly contacts a multiplicity of long vertical_fibers in a` gas-scrubbed assembly' comprising a skein and a gas-distribution_means
¡¬373_patent col.7 ll.55-62 emphasis added ; see also id.at col.9 ll.46-49 stating that` [ i ] t is a specific object of this invention to provide the aforesaid novel gas-scrubbed assembly_comprising a bank of vertical_skeins and a shaped gas-distribution_means for use with the bank'
as such a reasonable_person of ordinary_skill in the art would understand that the gas_distribution_system covered by the ¡¬373_patent is not a detail relating to the construction and deployment of a vertical_skein but rather is a separate and distinct element of the invention and thus was not incorporated by reference in the ¡¬250_patent

we are not persuaded by zenons arguments to the contrary
zenon argues that the ¡¬250_patent incorporates the basic concept of the ¡¬373_patents gas_distribution_system and merely discloses an improving addition to that system
zenon argues that figure 3 of the ¡¬250_patent supports its assertion because in that figure coarse_bubbles are used to scrub the fibers as taught in the ¡¬ 373 patent
we disagree
while the specification describes figure 3 as a` a single_skein with its integral finished header and permeate_collection pan supported on a conversion_baffle held between opposed skirts of a shroud' ¡¬ 250 patent col.4 ll.16-19 the specification further teaches that the embodiment depicted in figure 3 also includes the elements depicted in figure 4 which includes a v-shaped trough 46 the air_supply_pipe 60 resting on the floor and fine-bubble_generators 61-elements not disclosed in the ¡¬373_patent
id.at col.10 ll.36-53

moreover the specification further teaches that the` baffle 40 is held above the floor 50 by opposing sidewalls or skirts and preferably the baffle is formed *1381 integrally with a box-shaped shroud having opposed sidewalls 42_and_42 ¡¬ and opposed end walls 43 43¡¬ not visible to confine the fine_bubbles beneath the lower_header
the sidewalls are high enough typically 1_to_2 meters to allow time for the oxygen in the air to dissolve in the water'
id.at col.10 ll.39-46 emphases added
thus rather than describe a gas_distribution_system` having through-passages through the lower_header to discharge bubbles into the substrate above the lower_header' as claimed in the ¡¬319_patent the ¡¬250_patent covers a gas_distribution_system that discharges fine_bubbles into the substrate well below the lower_header typically 1_to_2 meters beneath the lower_header
notably in the only example disclosed in the ¡¬250_patent the patent teaches that the fine-bubble_generators can be positioned as low as four meters beneath the lower_header
id.at col.12 ll.1-4` the skeins are submerged so that their lower_headers are about 2 meters below the surface of the liquid in the bioreactor
the aerators are positioned about 4 meters below the lower_header`
as such the ¡¬250_patent discloses a gas_distribution_system different from that disclosed in the ¡¬373_patent
what apparently occurred is that in filing the ¡¬250_patent application the gas_distribution_system disclosed in the ¡¬ 373 patent was replaced with a different_gas_distribution_system but when the ¡¬319_patent application was filed the original gas_distribution was restored
thus the chain of continuity was broken

we are further unpersuaded by zenons argument that the incorporation by reference_language is sufficiently clear such that it effectively incorporates the ¡¬373_patents gas_distribution_system
in support of that proposition zenon relies on cook_biotech_inc. v. acell inc. 460_f.3d_1365 fed.cir.2006
in that case the patentee intended to incorporate by reference a procedure described in an earlier_patent
the patent stated that the preparation of ubs from a segment of urinary_bladder is similar to the procedure for preparing intestinal_submucosa detailed in u.s._patent_no._4902,508 [` the ¡¬508_patent` ] the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference
id.at 1375
that language was deemed sufficient to incorporate by reference the procedure disclosed in the ¡¬508_patent
zenon argues that because the ¡¬250_patent uses similar general incorporation by reference_language the phrase` details relating to the construction and deployment of a most preferred_skein' is sufficiently clear to incorporate the gas_distribution_system disclosed in the ¡¬373_patent

zenons reliance on cook is misplaced
the ¡¬508_patent at issue in cook related to a method for preparing a tissue graft composition from a segment of the small intestine ¡¬508_patent abstract and the incorporation by reference_language clearly sought to incorporate that process
in contrast to the present_case the patentee in cook did not purport to incorporate by reference material that exceeded the plain_language of the incorporation statement
here zenon seeks to incorporate the ¡¬373_gas_distribution_system which as discussed above is not covered by the plain_language of the incorporation by reference_language nor by the disclosures of the ¡¬373_patent
thus cook does not aid zenon and the language in the ¡¬250_patent is not sufficiently clear to incorporate the ¡¬373_gas_distribution_system

lastly we disagree with zenons assertion that the skeins can not be deployed without the ¡¬373_patent gas_distribution_system based on the embodiments of the ¡¬373_patent and therefore the gas_distribution_system must be a detail relating to the skein
that contention is belied by claims *1382 1-9 of the patent as discussed above which claim a membrane_device that includes a skein but not a gas_distribution_system

accordingly because the ¡¬250_patent fails to incorporate by reference with sufficient_particularity to one reasonably skilled in the art the gas_distribution_system disclosed in the ¡¬373_patent and thus a lack of continuity of disclosure exists in the family_chain the ¡¬319_patent is not entitled to the filing_date of the ¡¬373_patent
because it is undisputed that the ¡¬373_patent discloses each and every limitation of the claims of the ¡¬319_patent and the ¡¬373_patent was filed more than one year prior to the filing of the ¡¬319_patent we thus conclude that the ¡¬319_patent is anticipated by the ¡¬373_patent and hence invalid.3

b. cross-appeal
as zenon conceded at oral argument in light of our conclusion that the ¡¬ 319 patent is invalid as anticipated by the ¡¬373_patent we need not reach the cross-appeal in which zenon seeks to reverse the district_courts grant of summary_judgment of noninfringement

conclusion
for the foregoing reasons we reverse the district_courts judgment that the ¡¬ 319 patent is not invalid as anticipated by the ¡¬373_patent

reversed
newman circuit_judge dissenting
i respectfully dissent for my colleagues have converted fact into law and ignored the findings of the district_court as well as the agreed and undisputed facts and misapplied the rules of incorporation by reference
the consequence is that the disclosure in the` grandparent' ¡¬373 patent is held by this court to` anticipate' and thereby invalidate the` grandchild' ¡¬319 patent that contains the text of the ¡¬373_patent

the pretrial order stated and it is not disputed that the ¡¬373_patent` discloses each and every element of the claims of the ¡¬319_patent'
the district_court stated that` [ c ] laim 7 of the ¡¬319_patent at issue in this case is agreed by the parties to be completely disclosed by [ the ¡¬373_patent ]'
zenon_environmental inc. v. united_states_filter_corp. no._03 cv1996-b s.d
cal may_4,_2005 slip op.at 2
the parties agree that the subject_matter of claim 7 appears in the ¡¬373 specification the appellants brief stating` the parties agree that the ¡¬373_patent and ¡¬083_patent the first two patents in the family_chain disclose the gas_distribution_system of the ¡¬319_patent' and the appellees brief stating` it is undisputed that the ¡¬319_patent discloses the gas_distribution_system of the ¡¬373_patent'
in all of the patents the distribution system is described whereby gas flows from the base of the skein through passages in the skein

the continuity from the ¡¬373 application was preserved through several continuing applications and divisionals which claim various aspects of the evolving invention
35 u.s.c.¡± 120 provides that continuity with previously filed applications is established
*1383.. if filed before the patenting or abandonment of or termination of proceedings on the first_application or on an application similarly entitled to the benefit of the filing_date of the first_application and [ contains ] a specific_reference to the earlier filed application
it is not disputed that the requirements of overlapping pendency and specific_reference to the earlier filed application were met
the ¡¬319_patent sets forth the chain of copending applications back to the ¡¬373_patent ; the specification of the ¡¬319_patent stating in the` cross-reference to related applications' this application is a continuation of ser
no._09_/507,438 filed feb._19,_2000 issued as u.s._pat
no._6294,039 ; which is a division of ser
no._09_/258,999 filed fed

no._08_/896,517 filed jun._16,_1997 issued as u.s._pat

no._08_/514,119 filed aug._11,_1995 issued as u.s._pat
no._5639,373
the disclosure of all the patents and applications listed above are hereby incorporated by reference thereto as if fully set forth herein
¡¬319_patent col. 1 lines 8-21
the intervening ¡¬250_patent contains the specific incorporation by reference clause here at issue the vertical_skein is not the subject_matter of this invention and any prior_art_vertical_skein may be used
further_details relating to the construction and deployment of a most preferred_skein are found in the parent_u.s._pat
no._5639,373 and in ser
no._08_/690,045 the relevant_disclosures of each of which are included by reference thereto as if fully set forth herein
¡¬250_patent col. 2 lines 30-36
the district_court concentrated on the` construction and deployment' portion of this clause in response to the defendants argument that continuity of disclosure was lost by that clause of the ¡¬250_patent

although the panel_majority agrees that the grandparent_¡¬373_patent` discloses each and every element of the claims of the ¡¬319_patent' maj. op.at 1377 my colleagues rule as a matter of` law' that the ¡¬373_patent invalidates the ¡¬319_patent
the subject_matter on which the majority focuses is clause d of claim 7 of the ¡¬319_patent [ 7 ] d a gas_distribution_system having through-passages through the lower_header to discharge bubbles into the substrate above the lower_header
the panel_majority holds that claim 7 is invalid because the same gas_distribution_system is described in the ¡¬373_patent but the full text of the ¡¬373_patent was not reproduced in all of the intervening patents but in part incorporated by reference
contrary to the findings of fact of the district_court the panel_majority finds that the incorporation_clause in the ¡¬ 250 patent supra broke the continuity of disclosure

this defense was presented to the district_court the defendant arguing that it was not sufficiently clear whether the words of incorporation embraced all of the elements of the grandparent_¡¬373_patent and the grandchild ¡¬ 319 patent and particularly the gas_distribution through the skein
the district_court held an evidentiary hearing to determine what a person of ordinary_skill in the field of the invention would understand from the clause incorporating the` details relating to the construction and deployment of a most preferred_skein'
see advanced_display *1384 systems inc. v. kent state university 212_f.3d_1272 1282 fed.cir.2000` the standard of one reasonably skilled in the art should be used to determine whether the host_document describes the material to be incorporated by reference with sufficient_particularity' ; u.s. steel corp. v. phillips petroleum co. 865_f.2d_1247 1251 fed.cir.1989 a patents specification` is to be understood for what it meant to one having ordinary_skill in the art at the time the application was filed'

the question of what material would be understood as incorporated is a question of fact on which the district_court made extensive findings including [ a ] gas_distribution_system is clearly related-intimately-to the construction and deployment of the skeins described in the ¡¬373_patent
[ zenon slip op.at 5 ]
the incorporation by reference to` details relating to the construction and deployment of the skeins' disclosed in the ¡¬373_patent and the application for the ¡¬083_patent would be readily understood by a person of ordinary_skill in the art to involve a gas_distribution_system
[ id.at 5-6 ]
[ a ] person of ordinary_skill would have little or no interest in any disclosures of the ¡¬373_patent other than all disclosures relating to the construction and deployment of the skeins shown in the ¡¬373_patent and of course the gas_distribution_system is the` elephant in the room' of relevancy for those disclosures
[ id.at 6 ]
[ zenon ] showed how clearly anything in the disclosures which related to the construction and deployment of a preferred_skein would be understood by a person of ordinary_skill and [ at the ] top of the list would be the gas_distribution_system
[ id ]
no witness testified that a gas_distribution_system did not relate to the construction and deployment of a skein..
[ id ]
[ t ] he relevance of the gas_distribution_system disclosures in the ¡¬373_patent can not be missed since the ¡¬250_patent discloses in part the coarse bubble gas scrubbing system which takes over from the completion of the service of the conversion_baffles which deliver course bubbles to the skein for cleansing the fibers there above
[ id.at 8 ]
[ t ] he reference to` details relating to the construction and deployment of a most preferred_skein' clearly and specifically direct a person of ordinary_skill to the gas_distribution_system of ¡¬373 which is thus incorporated by reference in the ¡¬250
[ id ]
the district_court referred to the burden of proof as the court found that continuity of disclosure was preserved from the ¡¬373_patent to the ¡¬ 319 patent [ a ] lthough not plaintiffs burden the court finds the incorporations by reference are fully informative to a person of ordinary_skill and that they permit the transfer of all disclosures of the ¡¬373_patent which cover claim 7 of the ¡¬319_patent to flow through all intermediary_patents to the ¡¬319
[ id.at 5 ]
the court also observed that the incorporation was reviewed by the patent_examiner
this administrative finding carries the deference required by the administrative procedure act
see dickinson v. zurko 527_u.s._150 152 119_s.ct._1816 144_l.ed.2d_143_(1999)
my colleagues ignore the administrative findings as they ignore the district_court

the district_court found [ t ] he court finds the incorporations by reference are fully informative to a person of ordinary_skill and that they permit the transfer of all disclosures of the *1385 ¡¬373_patent which cover claim 7 of the ¡¬319_patent to flow through all intermediary_patents to the ¡¬319
[ zenon slip op.at 5 ]
the panel_majority does not review the district_courts findings and instead announces that this is a matter of` law'
however the question of what would be` reasonably conveyed to a person skilled in the relevant_art' is a classical question of fact
bilstad v. wakalopulos 386_f.3d_1116 1126 fed.cir.2004
indeed this court has explained that we are` not permitted to make' such fact findings [ a ] resolution of the question of whether bilstads disclosure of manipulation in a small number of directions would reasonably convey to a person skilled in the relevant_art that bilstad had possession of manipulation in a plurality of directions as of his filing_date requires fact findings this court is not permitted to make
id.at 1126 emphasis added

the question of what technology is included in the incorporation_clause as it would be understood by a person of ordinary_skill in the field of the invention was resolved by the district_court in findings that have not been shown to be clearly erroneous
these highly factual questions are not rules of law ; they are the facts to which 35 u.s.c.¡± 120 is applied
cf
arrowhead indus water inc. v. ecolochem inc. 846_f.2d_731 735 fed.cir.1988` the district_courts view of the legal effect of the fact pattern before it is not to be lightly disregarded'

my colleagues also criticize the specificity of the incorporation_clause in the ¡¬250_patent
however this clause is not distinguishable in specificity from that ratified in cook biotech inc. v. acell inc. 460_f.3d_1365 fed.cir.2006 where the incorporation_clause was as follows the preparation of ubs from a segment of urinary_bladder is similar to the procedure for preparing intestinal_submucosa detailed in u.s._patent_no._4902,508 the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference
id.at 1376
the only difference in the specificity of the incorporation in the ¡¬250_patent and the traditional incorporation text is the uncertainty brought by the court to this routine practice
incorporation by reference is a routine expedient of patent_drafting
the district_courts finding that a person of ordinary_skill in the field of the invention would understand what is included in the incorporated subject_matter ends the inquiry

the issue in this case is simple
the issue is not whether the invention claimed in the ¡¬319_patent could have been claimed in the ¡¬373 grandparent ; nor is the issue one of priority as against a competing claimant ; nor is the applicant reaching out for a broad incorporation of background technology from unspecified parts of unrelated publications
here the applicant simply invoked the expedient of incorporating a prior disclosure in a chain of applications on the same subject_matter
the gas_distribution_system described in the ¡¬319_patent is the same as that of the ¡¬373_patent with continuity of disclosure that includes an incorporation by reference

the panel_majoritys holding casts_doubt on the reliable_use of this expedient lest an earlier_patent become an invalidating reference against its successors in the chain of filings
the majoritys rejection of the factual foundations of incorporation by reference and creation of a new area of de novo appellate authority raise new_risks of patent_drafting
the apparent requirement that all subject_matter must *1386 be reproduced in all continuing applications adds nothing to the knowledge disclosed to the public adds nothing to the information provided to the patent_examiner and adds nothing to compliance with 35 u.s.c.¡± 120 ; it simply adds costs and pitfalls to inventors as they attempt to walk new judicial tightropes

dissenting op.at 1385
however patent draftsmanship is an exacting art and no less care is required in drafting an incorporation by reference statement than in any other aspect of a patent application
the draftsman here made clear what was being incorporated by reference and by difference what was not
no doubt or risk arises from carefully drafted language that is interpreted to mean what it says
