regeneron_pharmaceuticals inc.` regeneron' appeals from a final_judgment of the district_court holding u.s. patent no._8502,018`018_patent` unenforceable because of regenerons inequitable_conduct during prosecution
regeneron also appeals the district_courts construction of several claim terms and determination of indefiniteness
because we conclude that regeneron engaged in inequitable_conduct during prosecution of the018_patent we affirm

i
in march 2014 regeneron filed suit in the southern_district of new_york accusing merus_b.v.` merus' of infringing the018_patent
the district_court heard argument and expert testimony on claim_construction and issued an opinion construing various terms
see regeneron_pharm. inc. v. merus_b.v. no._1 4-cv-1650 2014_wl_6611510_(s.d.n.y._nov._21,_2014)
the court also declared one term indefinite
id.at *23-24

merus asserted a counterclaim of unenforceability due to inequitable_conduct
it argued that regenerons patent prosecutors withheld four references the` withheld_references' from the u.s. patent and trademark_office` pto' during prosecution of the018_patent
according to merus these references were cited in a third-party submission in related u.s. patent_prosecution and in european opposition briefs were but-for material and were withheld by regeneron with the specific_intent to deceive the pto
there was no dispute that regeneron knew of the withheld_references during prosecution of the018_patent
regeneron argues however that the references were not but-for material that they were cumulative of references the pto actually relied on during prosecution and that regeneron did not have any specific_intent to deceive the pto

the district_court scheduled a bench_trial on regenerons inequitable_conduct but bifurcated the trials based on the two elements of inequitable_conduct a first_bench_trial on the materiality of the withheld_references and a second bench_trial regarding the specific_intent to deceive the pto
see therasense inc. v. becton dickinson & co. 649_f.3d_1276 1287 fed
cir
2011 en banc

following the first trial the district_court issued a lengthy opinion detailing the materiality of the withheld_references
*1347 regeneron_pharm. inc. v. merus_b.v. 144_f.supp.3d_530 s.d.n.y
2015` regeneron_i'1 the district_court however never held the scheduled second_trial on regenerons specific_intent to deceive the pto
instead in its opinion following the first_bench_trial the court exhaustively detailed regenerons discovery_misconduct throughout litigation and sanctioned regeneron by drawing an adverse_inference of specific_intent to deceive the pto
in particular the district_court discussed regenerons repeated violations of the district_courts discovery orders and improper secreting of relevant and non-privileged documents
based on this misconduct the district_court drew an adverse_inference that regenerons agents failed to disclose the withheld_references to the pto with the specific_intent to deceive the pto
having determined the but-for materiality of the withheld_references and drawn an adverse_inference of regenerons specific_intent to deceive the pto the district_court concluded that regeneron had committed inequitable_conduct and held the018_patent unenforceable

regeneron timely appealed the district_courts claim_construction order and final_judgment of inequitable_conduct
we have jurisdiction under 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

a
the018_patent emerged from a family of applications that originated in december 2000
in february 2001 regeneron filed a continuation-in-part from that original application which ultimately issued as u.s._patent_no._6596,541`541_patent`
regeneron then filed a divisional of the541_patent and from that divisional filed several continuations including u.s
application_no._1 3/164,176`176 application' entitled` method of modifying eukaryotic cells'
that continuation application issued as the018_patent on august 6 2013 to inventors drs
andrew j. murphy and george d. yancopoulos who assigned it to regeneron

in general the018_patent relates to using large dna vectors to target and modify endogenous genes and chromosomal loci in eukaryotic_cells
'018_patent col. 1_ll._17 -33
one practical use of this technology is that users may target and modify specific genes in mice so that the mice develop antibodies that can be used by humans

antibodies are proteins that the body uses to counter-act specific pathogens such as bacteria viruses and other foreign substances in the blood
antibodies are typically represented by a` y' shape consisting of four chains of amino acids two longer` heavy' chains and two shorter` light' chains
each of the chains in turn consists of two regions a` variable' region toward the top of the` y' and a` constant' region toward the bottom
one such antibody is illustrated below *1348

?
appellants br
5 stripes added
in this antibody the light chains are striped and the heavy_chains are solid
further the constant_regions are represented in lighter shades and the variable_regions in darker shades

mouse dna coding for antibodies can be modified using human_dna in various different ways
for example mouse_dna can be manipulated to create chimeric_antibodies that have mouse_variable_region_dna and human_constant_region_dna
similarly mice can be used to create humanized antibodies that have some mouse_variable_region_dna some human_variable_region_dna and human_constant_region_dna
further genetically modified mice can be used to create antibodies that have fully human_dna
finally mice can also be modified to create reverse_chimeric_antibodies that have mouse_constant_region dna and human_variable_region_dna
this spectrum of modified antibodies is illustrated below

claim 1 of the018_patent the only claim at issue here recites in its entirety` [ a ] genetically modified mouse comprising in its germline_human_unrearranged_variable_region_gene_segments inserted at an endogenous_mouse_immunoglobulin_locus'
'018_patent col. 29_ll._24 -26
as discussed in greater detail below regeneron contends that under the broadest_reasonable_construction this claim is limited to mice that produce reverse_chimeric_antibodies
merus on the other_hand argues that under the broadest_reasonable_construction claim 1 includes mice that can produce humanized fully human or reverse_chimeric_antibodies.2

b
as originally filed claim 1 of the176 application recited` [ a ] genetically modified mouse comprising in its germline human *1349 unrearranged variable gene region segments inserted at a mouse_immunoglobulin_locus'
j.a
450
in january 2012 the pto issued a non-final_office_action rejecting claims 1-19 of the176 application as being anticipated by a u.s
application_no._1 1/009,873 to nils lonberg and robert kay` lonberg'
j.a
376-88

in july 2012 regenerons dr._smeland in-house counsel responsible for prosecuting the176 application and others in the same family in the united_states and europe replied to this office action
he argued that unlike the recited claims of the176 application lonberg teaches random and not targeted_insertion
in particular dr._smeland argued that lonberg did not teach inserting` human_unrearranged_variable_region_gene_segments' in the mouse immunoglobulin` ig' locus
instead according to dr._smeland lonberg teaches genes that are` randomly inserted at unknown loci'
j.a
408-09

in october 2012 the pto mailed a final_office_action rejecting the pending claims of the176 application maintaining the rejection of claims 1-19 as anticipated by lonberg

in a january 2013 reply to the final_office_action regeneron amended claim 1 to include the additional limitation that the human_unrearranged_variable_region_gene_segments would be inserted at` an endogenous' mouse_immunoglobulin_locus
regeneron also sent a presentation to the pto with the reply
in that presentation regeneron asserted that it had developed a commercial_embodiment of the claimed mouse with surprising results
it is undisputed that that assertion was false
j.a
7563
regeneron had not developed any such mouse at the time

following receipt of dr._smelands reply and presentation the pto issued an advisory action maintaining the rejection of claims 1-19 as anticipated by lonberg and claim 20 remained rejected in view of lonberg and other_references
shortly thereafter in february 2013 regeneron retained brendan jones ph.d. to assist with prosecution
drs
jones and smeland together planned an in-person meeting with the examiner during which they relied on the misleading presentation asserting that regeneron had developed a commercial_embodiment of the claimed mouse
that meeting occurred in march 2013

following that meeting in april 2013 the pto issued a notice of allowance for the176 application
in the statement of reasons for allowance the examiner stated that` [ t ] he prior_art does not teach or suggest a genetically modified mouse_comprising in its germline_cells human_unrearranged_variable_region_gene_segments inserted at an endogenous_mouse_immunoglobulin_locus'
j.a
531
the applicant transmitted the fee in june 2013 and the018_patent issued on august 6 2013

c. days before the pto issued its notice of allowance for the176 application which would become the018_patent a third-party filed a submission in the parent application of the018_patent describing three references 1

`` 3

given their prior work regeneron recruited drs
alt and rajewsky to its scientific advisory board to work on the claimed mouse before regeneron filed the018_patent
during prosecution these individuals corresponded with dr._murphy an018_patent inventor expressing concerns about his characterizations of the prior_art in related publications

dr._smeland knew of the third party submission as well as all four withheld_references during prosecution yet withheld them from the018_patents examiner
although regeneron did not disclose the withheld_references during prosecution of the018_patent once the018_patent had been allowed regeneron disclosed the withheld_references to the pto in every related_application having the same specification and similar claims
merus contends that regenerons failure to disclose the withheld_references constituted inequitable_conduct
regeneron responds that dr._smeland was under no obligation to disclose these references because they were not but-for material

`` inequitable_conduct is an equitable defense to patent infringement that if proved bars enforcement of a patent'

a
the first_step in an inequitable_conduct_inquiry is determining whether the patentee failed to disclose but-for material_information to the pto
determining but-for materiality requires that the court place itself in the shoes of a patent_examiner and determine whether had the reference s been before the examiner at the time the claims of the patent would have still issued
therasense 649 f.3d at 1291-92

as with an invalidity analysis the first_step in determining but-for materiality of a reference is determining the scope of the claims at issue
thus the court must first determine the broadest_reasonable_construction of the claims that the pto would have applied during prosecution
next based on the broadest_reasonable_construction the court must determine whether a reasonable patent_examiner would have allowed the claims had she known of the withheld_references

id
( internal_quotation_marks omitted

both regeneron and merus agree that the claimed mouse has as recited in claim 1` human_unrearranged_variable_region_gene_segments'
but regeneron argues that under the broadest_reasonable_construction of claim 1 the non-variable constant region of the claimed mouses modified gene_segments exclusively contains mouse_genes
in other words regeneron argues that claim 1 is limited to a reverse_chimeric_mouse
appellants br
32-35
merus on the other_hand argues that the constant_region of the gene_segments in the claimed mouse may contain mouse_genes or human_genes and may therefore be reverse chimeric humanized or fully human
appellees br
51

regeneron first relies on the claim_language to support its position
as noted above claim 1 recites` [ a ] genetically modified mouse comprising in its germline_human_unrearranged_variable_region_gene_segments inserted at an endogenous_mouse_immunoglobulin_locus'
according to regeneron because claim 1 only recites modifying the mouse by inserting` human_unrearranged_variable_region_gene_segments' it implies leaving the remainder of the mouses dna unmodified
this however is inaccurate
because` comprise' is inclusive or open-ended the use of the term does not exclude unrecited_elements
see genentech inc. v. chiron corp. 112_f.3d_495 501 fed
cir
1997`comprising is a term of art used in claim_language which means that the named elements are essential but other elements may be added and still form a construct within the scope of the claim
`` ; accord mpep ¡± 2111.03` the transitional termcomprising which is synonymous withincludingcontaining orcharacterized by is inclusive or open-ended and does not exclude additional unrecited_elements or method steps`
a germline that` comprises' human_variable_region_gene_segments may very well also include human constant gene_segments
thus the` customary and ordinary' meaning of the language in claim 1 is not limited to a reverse_chimeric_mouse

regeneron further argues that the specification purportedly limits the claim to mice that produce` hybrid antibodies containing human_variable_regions and mouse_constant_regions'
appellants br
33 citing018_patent col. 20_ll._37 -39
the patent however clearly teaches producing antibodies that` compris [ e ] a human_constant_region'
'018_patent col. 7_ll._19 -23 emphasis added
regeneron argues that this disclosure is limited to reverse_chimeric_antibodies that are later modified to insert a human_constant_region
but regeneron points to no portion of the specification to support its argument
in context it is clear that the endogenously produced antibodies may comprise a human_constant_region
the specification thus does not limit the claims to mice with human_variable_regions and mouse_constant_regions

accordingly we disagree with regeneron and conclude that under the broadest_reasonable_construction the district_court correctly found that the claims are not limited to mice that solely comprise mouse_constant_region gene_segments

2
under this broadest_reasonable_construction the court next determines if the district_court clearly erred in finding the withheld_references but-for material and not cumulative of prior_art that the pto considered during prosecution
we conclude that the district_court properly found *1353 that the withheld_references were but-for material and were not cumulative

during prosecution drs
smeland and murphy knew of the withheld_references and did not disclose them to the pto
merus argues and the district_court found that each of these references was but-for material i.e. the` pto would not have allowed [ the ] claim had it been aware of' these references
therasense 649 f.3d at 1291
regeneron disagrees
as noted above the four withheld_references were bruggemann wood taki and zou

first regeneron argues that the district_court improperly found bruggemann to be but-for material
bruggemann is a review_paper that teaches the use of transgenic mice to express human_antibodies
in particular bruggemann teaches that` [ a ] n attractive_alternative [ to the random_integration of human_genes into mouse_genes ] would be to replace the mouse_ig_loci with the human_ig_loci'
j.a
3917
bruggemann further expands that in doing so` much of the dna of the mouse_ig_loci' might be replaced with human_dna
j.a
3918
regeneron only contests bruggemanns materiality because bruggemann purportedly does not disclose a reverse-chimeric mouse
see appellants br
37-38` [ bruggemann ] does not specify that the mouse_constant_region should be retained or that any portion of the mouse locus should be retained at all`
as discussed above however claim 1 is not limited to reverse-chimeric_mice
claim 1 encompasses humanized fully human and reverse chimeric_mice as well
we therefore are not persuaded by the distinction drawn by regeneron and conclude that the district_court did not clearly err in finding bruggemann but-for material

second regeneron argues that the district_court improperly found wood to be but-for material
according to regeneron wood does not teach inserting a human variable gene into a mouse by targeting the mouse_ig_locus
instead regeneron contends that wood teaches` randomly integrating human transgenes' into a mouse_genome with no such targeting
appellants br
40

as meruss expert dr. geoff davis explained however wood does disclose specific targeting of the mouses ig_locus
for example wood teaches that` [ t ] he present invention relates generally to immunoglobulin rearrangement in chimeric and transgenic_animals and more specifically to a mouse containing in its germline.. the ability to generate immunoglobulins..' wood at 1:4-9 emphasis added ; j.a
2125-26
wood further teaches that when human_dna is combined with mouse_dna the` constant_region' i.e. the constant_region of the dna in the ig_locus` is of exogenous or endogenous species origin' and that this constant_region may be` from the animal itself'
wood at 6:17-20 10:3-5 emphasis added ; j.a
2126-28
skilled artisans are therefore taught to specifically target the endogenous ig_locus when inserting human_dna into the mouse
the district_court did not err in finding wood but-for material

the dissent argues that wood is not material because it only teaches a` dna_fragment_construct' but does not describe` any targeted_insertion_method described elsewhere in the prior_art..' dissent at 1373
as an initial matter neither party argues this position and the district_court did not make this factual finding
see 3m co. v. avery dennison corp. 673_f.3d_1372 1378 fed
cir
2012` [ i ] t is improper for us to determine factual issues in the first_instance on appeal.. finding those facts in the first_instance would overstep our bounds as a reviewing court and we can not resolve the parties factual disputes on appeal`
regardless the dissents argument is unavailing because the claim at issue does not recite a particular method *1354 of inserting dna into a mouse
the claim simply recites a genetically modified mouse that comprises` human_unrearranged_variable_region_gene_segments inserted at an endogenous_mouse_immunoglobulin_locus'
wood teaches that` [ t ] he animals of this invention are designed by the integration into their germlines of dna carrying unrearranged or only partially rearranged exogenous ig gene_segments'
j.a
2127
wood thus teaches the elements of the claim at issue and is but-for material

third regeneron argues that the district_court improperly found taki to be but-for material
according to regeneron taki only teaches inserting rearranged variable_region dna from one mouse into the genome of another mouse
claim 1 on the other_hand recites inserting unrearranged human_variable_region_dna into a mouse_genome

as the district_court correctly noted taki teaches insertion of exogenous i.e. foreign` rearranged mouse_variable_region [ dna ] into the ig_locus' to produce a transgenic_mouse with good_b-cell_development and antibodies
regeneron_i 144 f.supp.3d at 573
the development of a transgenic_mouse with good_b-cell_development and antibodies is also an intended goal of the018_patent
'018_patent col. 20_ll._63 -65` these interactions are important for a strong and specific immune response for the proliferation and maturation of b cells and for the affinity maturation of antibodies`
the fact that taki teaches using exogenous_mouse_dna instead of exogenous_human_dna does not detract from the motivation_taki provides to target the mouse_ig_locus with exogenous_dna including human_dna
as the district_court correctly found taki teaches targeting at the specific locus-the ig_locus-with operable linkage.. taking advantage of the mouse regulatory and constant_regions
taki in short provides the motivation to target human_variable_region_dna into the mouse_ig_locus
regeneron_i 144 f.supp.3d at 574
the district_court did not err by finding takis disclosure of targeting insertion of exogenous variable_region dna to be but-for material

fourth regeneron argues that the district_court improperly found zou to be but-for material
regeneron contends that zou only teaches modifying a mouses constant_region whereas the018_patent teaches modifying a mouses variable_region
according to regeneron` the018_patent discloses the insertion of human_variable_regions ; zou does not
zou discloses the insertion of human_constant_regions ; the018_patent does not'
appellants br
44

as even regeneron admits zou teaches specifically inserting human_ig_dna into the mouse_ig_locus preserving part of the mouse_constant_region and discloses producing antibodies at the` same level and efficiency as wild-type mice'
j.a
2414-17
the district_court properly found that zous teaching of inserting portions of human constant rather than variable dna did not detract from its motivation to insert human_variable_regions in the mouse_ig_locus
in fact as meruss expert dr. davis noted bruggemann cited zou for this precise disclosure a few years later
j.a
2123-24
thus the district_court properly concluded that zou was also but-for material

in addition to arguing that the withheld_references are not but-for material individually regeneron also argues that the withheld_references are not but-for material in combination
we disagree
as noted above the references both individually and in combination teach one of skill in the art to genetically modify mice by inserting exogenous including human variable_region *1355 gene_segments endogenously into a mouse_immunoglobulin_locus
the references in particular taki and zou also provide the motivation to combine these references to develop the genetically modified mouse

regeneron also argues that bruggemann wood and taki are cumulative of references that the examiner considered during prosecution of the018_patent4 in particular regeneron contends that bruggemann is cumulative of u.s._patent_no._6114,598 issued to raju kucherlapati et al
on june_5,_1995` kucherlapati' wood is cumulative of lonberg and taki is cumulative of kucherlapati and lonberg
there is no dispute that the pto considered both lonberg and kucherlapati during prosecution

kucherlapati relates generally to` the production of xenogeneic specific binding proteins in a viable mammalian host'

kucherlapati explains that in a modified mouse the target [ or mouse ] locus may be substituted with the analogous xenogeneic [ or human ] locus
in this way the xenogeneic_locus will be placed substantially in the same_region as the analogous_host_locus so that any regulation associated with the position of the locus will be substantially the same for the xenogeneic_immunoglobulin_locus

lonberg relates generally to` transgenic non-human animals capable of producing heterologous antibodies..' lonberg at ?

as regeneron explains lonberg teaches using a`knockout plus transgene method for genetically engineering mice
under that method human variable and human_constant_region gene_segments are randomly integrated into the mouse_genome while the mouses own antibody genes areknocked out by targeted deactivation of the mouse_immunoglobulin_locus'

although regeneron argues that bruggemann is cumulative of kucherlapati we disagree
bruggemann instructs to` retain and exploit any possible_regulatory_sequences in the mouse_loci that are located distal to protein-coding regions' and cites zous method to accomplish this
j.a
3917
in contrast regeneron represented both during prosecution of a related_application and in litigation that kucherlapatis discussion of a` xenogeneic_locus' is not enabled and concerns wholesale_replacement
j.a
2178-80 regenerons non-final_office_action response u.s. patent application_no._1 3/719,819` [ o ] ne of ordinary_skill in the art would not have a reasonable expectation of successfully using the yac-based method described in kucherlapati to generate the mice comprising the targeted_insertion of human_unrearranged_variable_region_gene_segments into the endogenous_mouse_immunoglobulin_locus as currently *1356 claimed
`` ; j.a

further regenerons technical_expert testified that kucherlapatis prophetic_description would disrupt` important_aspects of lymphoid_development' and would prevent normal_b_cell_development
j.a

because bruggemann teaches targeted gene_replacement as compared to kucherlapatis non-enabled wholesale_replacement bruggemann teaches a known technique to target the ig_locus nowhere found in kucherlapati

regeneron also unpersuasively argues that wood is cumulative of lonberg
as dr._smeland stated to the pto during prosecution` lonberg does not disclose a mouse_comprising in its germline_human_unrearranged_variable_region_gene_segments inserted at a mouse_immunoglobulin_locus
instead lonberg discloses transgenes that are apparently randomly inserted at unknown loci'
j.a
408-09
wood as explained above teaches skilled artisans to specifically target the mouse_ig_locus and insert human variable dna there
thus wood is not cumulative of lonberg

finally regeneron argues that taki is cumulative of kucherlapati and lonberg
as noted above even regenerons technical_expert testified that kucherlapatis prophetic_description would disrupt` important_aspects of lymphoid_development' and would prevent normal_b_cell_development
taki which teaches inserting` rearranged mouse_variable_region [ dna ] into the ig_locus' to produce a transgenic_mouse with good_b-cell_development and antibodies would not
regeneron_i 144 f.supp.3d at 573
further lonberg teaches targeting a mouse_ig_locus with a marker gene to inactivate the locus whereas taki teaches targeting functional exogenous variable_region dna to produce normal antibodies
j.a
2187-88
thus taki is not cumulative of kucherlapati and lonberg

in sum we conclude that the district_court did not clearly err in finding each of the withheld_references but-for material

b
as noted earlier the district_court never held a second_trial to determine if regeneron acted with the specific_intent to deceive the pto during prosecution
instead the court sanctioned regeneron for its litigation_misconduct by drawing an adverse_inference of specific_intent
contrary to regenerons arguments we determine that the district_court did not abuse its discretion by sanctioning regeneron in this manner

regenerons behavior in district_court was beset with troubling misconduct
in its november 2015 opinion the district_court extensively detailed regenerons litigation_misconduct and exercised its discretion to sanction regeneron
see regeneron_i 144 f.supp.3d at 585-96
on appeal regeneron argues that the district_court abused its discretion by sanctioning regeneron but does not meaningfully dispute any of the factual_findings underlying the district_courts decision
accordingly we largely repeat and adopt the district_courts factual_findings regarding regenerons litigation_misconduct below

1
according to the district_court regenerons misconduct began at a relatively early stage in litigation
the district_courts local patent rules required regeneron to disclose its infringement_contentions broken down by element to merus
regeneron claimed that it could not comply
instead regeneron provided a chart with infringement_contentions that listed each claim as consisting of a single limitation-that is a *1357 single element
merus moved to compel-seeking developed infringement_contentions
in that same motion merus also moved to compel production of documents as required by the district_courts rules relating to the conception and reduction to practice of the018_patent
regeneron claimed to have few such documents and did not include in its production a key document written by dr._murphy one of the inventors of the018_patent setting forth the018_patents conception and reduction to practice

the district_court issued a written decision in response to meruss motion to compel
discovery_order # 6 regeneron_pharm. inc. v. merus_b.v. no._1 4-cv-1650 s.d.n.y
july_22,_2014 dkt
no._8 2
at a later conference the district_court discussed its concerns regarding regenerons conduct and gave regeneron an opportunity to correct its contentions
regeneron chose not to do so
in both its order and at that conference the district_court noted that the infringement claim that regeneron had asserted-as with all infringement claims-required an element-by-element identity between the accused product and the018_patent
the district_court stated explicitly both in its written decision on the issue and at a hearing held soon thereafter that it was troubled by regenerons refusal
at that time experienced patent counsel later replaced by regenerons trial and appellate counsel here asserted that he did not understand what the district_court was asking for or how to break a claim down into elements
the district_court determined that this obfuscation made no sense and was a tactical choice-seeking to shift the plaintiffs burden in an infringement case to define the elements of a claim to the defendant

during claim_construction regeneron again chose tactics over substance
because regeneron was the plaintiff the district_courts rules required that regeneron first propose its claim_constructions and that the defendant then respond
regeneron took the position that no terms required construction
the district_court issued an order expressing its concern that regeneron was attempting to` game' the system by shifting the burden to merus to propose constructions and then to take shots at those proposals
discovery_order # 5 regeneron_pharm. inc. v. merus_b.v. no._1 4-cv-1650 2014_wl_3865366 at *1 s.d.n.y
july_22,_2014 dkt
no._8 1
to avoid this potential gamesmanship the district_court required regeneron to live by its plain language constructions
id.at *2

the district_court also detailed regenerons litigation_misconduct relating to the` jones_memo'
although this misconduct was not the primary_basis for the district_courts decision to impose sanctions the district_court explained that regenerons behavior with respect to the jones_memo was relevant for multiple reasons
first regenerons behavior followed the pattern of misconduct described above
second regeneron sought to use the memo as a cloak for its later misconduct that was the primary_basis for the district_courts sanctions decision

the jones_memo was created during prosecution of the018_patent
while he was prosecuting the patent regenerons in-house counsel dr._smeland retained dr._jones
dr._jones was an outside patent attorney as noted above retained to help with regenerons patent_prosecution
during prosecution of the018_patent dr._jones drafted a chart and memo in connection with his review of whether to disclose the withheld_references to the pto

during litigation in district_court regeneron listed the chart and memo on its privilege_log based on attorney-client_privilege
on the eve of dr._joness deposition however regeneron disclosed both the chart and the memo
merus asserted that *1358 this disclosure resulted in a broad privilege waiver and brought a motion to compel

the evidence presented to the district_court on that motion demonstrated that on november 7 2013 dr._jones had attached the chart to an email to dr._smeland and wrote` [ w ] hile we discussed this analysis in numerous calls i do n't know if i have ever sent you this document
for your records i have also attached a memo i drafted regarding the third-party disclosures made in the other u.s
case'
regeneron_i 144 f.supp.3d at 586
that email was forwarded to regenerons then outside-counsel on the same day
on november 11 2014 regenerons outside counsel wrote an email to regeneron stating` i believe brendan [ jones ] also discussed his analysis with tor [ smeland ] around the time that brendan prepared these memos'
id
that same e-mail notes that dr._jones` was asked to analyze [ ] whether certain_references that came up in the european opposition and the third party submission should be disclosed to the pto' and that` [ t ] here are several documents that he prepared on this subject in late june 2013'
id
( internal_quotation_marks omitted

the memo written by dr._jones on june_28,_2013 appeared in all respects to contain the formatting and content of a legal memo to regeneron-though it is designated as a memo to file
printed on a law firm letterhead and beginning with entry lines for` to'` cc'` from' and` regarding' the memo read` privileged and confidential' began with a summary section contained footnotes and was organized under formal headings
it described basic standards for the duty to disclose prior_art and analyzed the materiality of three publications
the memo amounted to an elucidation of the rationale underlying the charts and is inextricably connected to the charts
the district_court concluded that the document was plainly one created in connection with dr._joness provision of legal_advice to regeneron
id.at 586-87

the references to discussions of the chart and analysis made clear that dr._jones analyzed the prior_art and arrived at a legal conclusion about disclosure obligations as part of his advisory_role to regeneron
he contemporaneously communicated the substance of the very same advice to his client

regeneron argued that by disclosing the memo and the chart regeneron had not waived any privilege because the documents were not privileged
according to regeneron dr._jones had merely used these documents to assist himself in connection with his professional obligations unrelated to his advisory_role
the district_court found that regenerons argument was` seriously incorrect'
id.at 587

as part of its inquiry into this waiver the district_court decided to conduct an in camera_review of the documents related to the memo and the chart
in particular the district_court ordered that regeneron provide it with` [ a ] ll documents relating to groups or individuals who at the time of creation or subsequently thereto received a copy of the chart or memo' and` [ a ] ll documents and communications.. referring or relating in any way to dr._joness chart and memo'
id

in response regeneron provided the district_court a single binder containing what it represented was the universe of such materials
as it turned out this was false
instead of providing the district_court the documents that the court ordered regeneron applied its own conditions and only provided documents that directly related to the chart and memo
regeneron did not inform the district_court of this self-imposed limitation
the district_court thus believed the binder provided *1359 insight into all that was at issue and ruled on the motion

because regeneron affirmatively produced the jones_memo and accompanying chart to merus the district_court found that regeneron waived the attorney-client_privilege as to its subject_matter
the district_court ordered that regeneron produce all relevant documents concerning the decision to not disclose prior_art during the patent_prosecution to merus` order'
id.at 587-88

subsequently disputes arose as to the scope of the waiver
regeneron represented that it had produced all documents and communications related to any decision analysis or advice by dr._jones or anyone at regeneron on whether or not to disclose references from dr._jones charts and memo during prosecution of the018_patent
in searching for this information regeneron searched documents from messrs./ drs
... smeland.. murphy.. id.at 588
regeneron also asserted that it had produced all of its communications or attachments thereto from the time period of the prosecution of the018_patent` that even mentioned the content of any of the references cited' in the chart and memo
id
regeneron argued against meruss request to impose sanctions for non-compliance with the order by stating that it had explained to merus that its production was tailored to the subject_matter of the jones documents
regeneron also argued that broader disclosure could result in serious prejudice as it could impact a pending european patent appeal

the district_court determined that regeneron needed to produce any documents which reflected additional thoughts concerns and considerations given to whether certain_references should have been disclosed
the district_courts broad order included any other memos or communications related to whether such references should have been disclosed to the pto
included within the order would have been drafts of dr._joness chart or memo which might have contained a different conclusion memos of others who questioned dr._joness conclusion and the like
to remove all ambiguity the district_court required regeneron to confirm to merus that it had produced or would produce 1
all documents from anyone involved directly or indirectly in prosecuting the018_patent relating to whether prior_art should be or should have been disclosed as part of the prosecution of the018_patent.. 2
to avoid any doubt the following documents are included within the scope of the above directive a
all documents of any kind from the files of dr._jones and others with whom he worked on the prosecution of the018_patent regarding whether or not to disclose prior_art to the pto
all documents of any kind from the files of anyone else who was involved directly or indirectly in the prosecution of the018_patent and who may not be captured in paragraph 1 above who gave consideration to the relevance or applicability of prior_art to the018_patent
id.at 589
regeneron confirmed it had produced what was required

3
these events lead up to trial
a bench_trial on meruss claim of inequitable_conduct was scheduled to commence on june_8,_2015
under the local rules the district_court required the parties witnesses to testify by declaration/affidavit on direct examination
regeneron submitted trial_affidavits from drs
smeland and jones both attorneys acting as attorneys
at this time regenerons privilege_log indicated that it had withheld many_documents from dr. *1360 smelands files that he had authored or received on the basis of the attorney/client_privilege and/or work product doctrine
the same was true for dr._jones except for the binder of documents that regeneron had earlier disclosed pursuant to the district_courts order

merus cried foul
merus argued that regeneron was again engaging in a sword/shield use of the attorney client_privilege and moved to strike these affidavits based on inter alia the assertion that regeneron had shielded privileged documents from disclosure that were now directly implicated by the trial_declarations
according to merus dr._joness trial_affidavit relied heavily on information that regeneron failed to disclose during fact_discovery and in response to the district_courts prior order
in particular merus cited dr._joness deposition testimony that apart from a phone call that he had made to the pto to schedule a meeting he could not recall a single other communication with the examiner during the018_patent_prosecution
late-produced billing records referenced in dr._joness trial_affidavit however suggested otherwise

things were worse with respect to dr._smeland
merus argued that dr._smeland was proposing to testify about his views on the meaning of claim_language and his subjective understanding of the withheld_references
during discovery however regeneron had withheld numerous documents on precisely those topics on the basis of privilege

the district_court reviewed each of the trial_affidavits and concluded that a comparison of these affidavits with entries on regenerons privilege_logs raised a number of concerns
in his affidavit dr._smeland made dozens of assertions regarding topics about which regeneron had not disclosed documents by placing those documents on its privilege_log
in particular dr._smeland made statements about his understanding of the scope of the invention in the176 application his state of mind and what he knew and thought about each of the withheld_references at the time of patent_prosecution continuing up to the present
the district_court provided a lengthy list of dr._smelands problematic assertions to emphasize the seriousness of the issue
in particular dr._smeland stated that ¡E` i firmly believed-and still believe today-that bruggemann taki zou and wood were not material to patentability because they were substantially different from the mice claimed in the176 application.. and were cumulative of other information before the patent examiner'
¡E dr._smelands description of his understanding of what a materiality analysis for inequitable_conduct involves` regardless of whether i satisfied the minimum requirements of being an ordinary_skilled artisan i felt comfortable evaluating the art from that perspective during the prosecution of the176 application
when i did have questions however i did not hesitate to reach out to those with more experience and knowledge'
¡E` i routinely made regeneron inventors aware of the foregoing obligations when providing them with invention declarations'
¡E with regards to bruggemann and zou` i was generally familiar with the subject_matter of those two references.. [ a ] t no time did i consider these references to be material to patentability to the claims pending in the176 application'
¡E` because of this experience [ prosecuting the176 application as well as the287_patent ] i was readily familiar with both prior_art that was before the examiner in the176 application *1361 and the pending claims of the176 application'
¡E` i viewed the analysis [ relating to the withheld_references ] as straightforward'
¡E` i concluded that [ the withheld_references ] alone or combined with other prior_art of which i was aware were cumulative of information already before the examiner
furthermore it was my view that the skilled artisan would not have viewed them as teaching the reverse chimeric inventions that the examiner had allowed in the176 application'
id.at 590-93.5

these statements and others implicated dr._smelands knowledge and state of mind regarding the withheld_references directly-both during prosecution and continuing through to trial
during litigation regeneron made a choice to maintain the attorney-client_privilege as to dr._smelands knowledge and thoughts about the withheld_references during prosecution of the176 application
in maintaining its assertion of privilege regeneron shielded dr._smelands documents relating to his knowledge and thoughts about the withheld_references during prosecution from disclosure
as with any affirmative disclosure of information otherwise protected by the attorney-client_privilege however once the disclosure of the trial_affidavit was made as it was not inadvertent the waiver was complete
see in re von bulow 828_f.2d_94 102-03 2d cir
1987` [ s ] ubject matter waiver.. allows the attacking party to reach all privileged conversations regarding a particular subject once one privileged conversation on that topic has been disclosed
`` ; see also fort james corp. v. solo cup co. 412_f.3d_1340 1349 fed
cir
2005` the widely applied standard for determining the scope of a waiver of attorney-client_privilege is that the waiver applies to all other communications relating to the same subject_matter
``

thus on the day that regeneron disclosed dr._smelands trial_affidavit it waived the privilege as to the subject_matter of each of the topics the affidavit addressed
in particular regeneron waived privilege as to dr._smelands views on the broadest_reasonable_construction of the claim_language understanding of the technology and materiality including cumulativeness of each of the withheld_references

regeneron argued that it had fully complied with its disclosure requirements throughout litigation
merus on the other_hand pointed to entries on regenerons privilege_log that seemed inconsistent with regenerons representations
to resolve this dispute the district_court conducted an in camera_review of a subset of the` many thousands' of documents on regenerons log
regeneron_i 144 f.supp.3d at 594
according to the district_court the log turned out to be a` pandoras box'
id
the district_courts in camera_review revealed that there were dozens of` smeland documents' that were not disclosed during litigation but as to which privilege had now been waived
the district_courts in camera_review revealed additional serious discovery issues including a number of relevant non-privileged documents that had been withheld on the basis of privilege and documents that should have been produced pursuant to the order regarding the jones_memo issue that had not been disclosed

in all the district_court concluded that there were three categories of documents that presented serious concerns of discovery_misconduct *1362 1
non-privileged documents that were not produced and instead resided throughout litigation on the privilege_log e.g. numerous excel spreadsheets with scientific test results third party filings to the pto and fact statements by non-lawyers not seeking legal_advice
2
previously privileged documents as to which regeneron affirmatively waived the privilege by disclosing the` jones_memo' and that the district_court ordered be produced pursuant to its order
3
documents on the privilege_log relating to precisely those topics waived by regeneron when regeneron filed trial_declarations of drs
smeland and jones

the district_court determined that regenerons failure to make full and adequate production of documents in the first two categories during the period of fact_discovery independently of the trial misconduct warranted serious sanction
but the third_category was the most egregious
according to the district_court the production failure was undoubtedly larger than the few exemplars revealed by the courts in camera_review
given the thousands of documents on regenerons privilege_log the district_court concluded that it could not possibly learn the full extent of the problem

as to the first category there were spreadsheets related to scientific tests published articles correspondence with third_parties-all of which were relevant to issues in the case and should have been disclosed
although the ultimate value of the documents in this category was unclear it was clear that merus should have received them well before trial

in the second category the district_court concluded that there were a number of documents on the log involving dr._jones discussing his communication with the pto during prosecution of the018_patent
these should have been produced as part of the` jones_memo' waiver issue

the third_category was most troubling
in the third_category the district_court concluded that many_documents on the log were directly relevant to the topics as to which privilege has been waived
in particular these documents were directly relevant to drs
smeland and murphys mental_impressions of the withheld_references during prosecution of the018_patent
the documents would therefore have been relevant to determining if regeneron specifically intended to deceive the pto by failing to disclose the withheld_references during prosecution of the018_patent

based on its review of the privilege_log and its in camera_review of some of the documents on the log the district_court concluded that regenerons behavior warranted sanctioning
before imposing its sanction the district_court considered several alternate options including allowing the trial_declarations into evidence
to do so however the district_court would have had to wholesale reopen discovery requiring` a top-to-bottom re-review of the regeneron privilege_log'` additional document production fact depositions and revised expert reports and depositions'
regeneron_i 144 f.supp.3d at 594-95
additionally the district_court noted that given its` concerns with regenerons process to date the [ c ] ourt would require that any such process only occur with the direct oversight of a special master'
id
this would have significantly increased the time and cost for both merus and the district_court
as the district_court noted` [ a ] t this point in the litigation this is not a fair burden for merus or this [ c ] ourt'
id

the district_court also considered whether striking the trial_affidavits and precluding drs
smeland and murphy from testifying *1363 at trial would be a sufficient remedy
the court concluded that it would not because doing so would not address the problems caused by the first two categories of undisclosed_documents and would not address the delay and disruptions caused by regenerons behavior throughout litigation

the district_court ultimately concluded that it would be unfair to merus to reopen discovery on the eve of trial and inject further delay in the case entirely due to regenerons behavior
the court also concluded that doing so would impose an unfair burden on the court and require expending substantial additional judicial resources
further because regenerons behavior suggested` a pattern' of misconduct simply reopening discovery striking the problematic affidavits and/or shifting costs would not ensure fairness
id.at 595-96
accordingly the district_court sought an alternative remedy and concluded that it was appropriate to draw an adverse_inference against regeneron from the undisclosed_documents
in particular the district_court concluded that regeneron failed to disclose the withheld_references to the pto during prosecution of the018_patent with the specific_intent to deceive the pto

4
regeneron contends that it was improper for the district_court to apply an adverse_inference here
according to regeneron under second_circuit law a district_court may only apply an adverse_inference when a particular_piece of evidence is missing destroyed or untimely produced
appellants br
57-58 citing residential_funding 306 f.3d at 1066 because the district_court did not apply the adverse_inference to any particular_piece of evidence regeneron argues that the district_court abused its discretion
we disagree

although regeneron relies on residential_funding for its argument that case does not support regenerons position
there the second_circuit explained that a district_court may properly draw an adverse_inference when a party engages in discovery abuses even when no particular_piece of evidence is missing destroyed or untimely produced
residential_funding 306 f.3d at 107
in fact the second_circuit goes on to clarify that when` the alleged breach of a discovery_obligation is the non-production of evidence a district_court has broad_discretion in fashioning an appropriate sanction including the discretion to.. proceed with a trial and give an adverse_inference_instruction'
id
( emphasis added
residential_funding confirms the broad_discretion of district_courts in sanctioning parties for violating discovery_obligations and never limits the power of the district_court to only apply adverse_inferences against specific pieces of evidence that are missing destroyed or untimely produced

regeneron also argues that the district_courts sanction was not an adverse_inference but was in fact a dismissal which should have required a predicate finding of bad_faith
appellants br
57-63
as explained above however the district_courts sanction was not a dismissal but was a properly drawn adverse_inference against regeneron
even regeneron admits that bad_faith is not required for such a sanction
see reply br
27` that matters because although an ordinary adverse_inference does not require a finding of bad_faith more punitive sanctions do
`` ; accord residential_funding 306 f.3d at 101 *1364` [ d ] iscovery sanctions including an adverse_inference_instruction may be imposed where a party has breached a discovery_obligation not only through bad_faith or gross negligence but also through ordinary negligence

the dissent relies heavily on aptix_corp. v. quickturn_design_systems inc. 269_f.3d_1369_(fed._cir._2001) for the proposition that litigation_misconduct can not support a finding of unenforceability of a patent for inequitable_conduct
dissent at 1365-67
neither the parties nor the district_court relied on aptix and for good reason
aptix is inapposite

in aptix the district_court declared a patent unenforceable as a` penalty' because aptix engaged in litigation_misconduct under the doctrine of unclean_hands
269 f.3d at 1378
we reversed that decision holding that` the doctrine of unclean_hands [ does not ] provide a suitable basis for the district_courts judgment as this equitable doctrine is not a source of power to punish'
id
we did so because` the relief for unclean_hands targets specifically the misconduct without reference to the property_right that is the subject of the litigation'
id.at 1376
essentially we held that courts may not punish a partys post-prosecution misconduct by declaring the patent unenforceable

here regeneron is accused not only of post-prosecution misconduct but also of engaging in inequitable_conduct during prosecution
cf
dissent at 1366` [ i ] n order to invalidate the patent the inequitable_conduct must have occurred in patent_prosecution`
regenerons litigation_misconduct however obfuscated its prosecution misconduct
in particular regeneron failed to disclose documents directly related to its prosecuting attorneys mental_impressions of the withheld_references during prosecution of the018_patent
the district_court drew an adverse_inference to sanction this litigation_misconduct
the district_court did not punish regenerons litigation_misconduct by holding the patent unenforceable
only after merus proved the remaining elements of inequitable_conduct did the district_court hold the patent unenforceable
in light of appellants widespread_litigation_misconduct including appellants use of sword and shield tactics to protect drs
smeland and murphys thoughts regarding disclosure of the withheld_references to the pto during prosecution of the018_patent we conclude that the district_court did not abuse its discretion by drawing an adverse_inference of specific_intent to deceive the pto

c. substantial evidence supports the district_courts finding of but-for materiality of the withheld_references
further the district_court did not abuse its discretion by drawing an adverse_inference of regenerons specific_intent to deceive the pto
thus the district_court did not abuse its discretion in holding the018_patent unenforceable due to regenerons inequitable_conduct
because we conclude that regenerons inequitable_conduct renders the018_patent unenforceable we do not address *1365 regenerons remaining claim_construction and indefiniteness challenges

newman circuit_judge dissenting
the only issue decided by the panel_majority is the district_courts ruling of inequitable_conduct during patent_prosecution.1 i respectfully dissent for my colleagues apply incorrect law and add confusion to precedent

to establish` inequitable_conduct' in patent_prosecution both materiality and deceptive intent must be proved
`` inequitable_conduct' arises when material references were intentionally withheld by the patent applicant in order to deceive or mislead the examiner into granting the patent

intent to deceive can not be inferred ; yet here the district_court inferred intent to deceive during prosecution and invalidated the patent as a sanction for purported attorney misconduct during this litigation

the district_court found that certain uncited_references were` but-for material' to patentability-although the court did not find the018_patent claims invalid on the substantive content of these references
the district_court then declined to decide the question of specific_intent to deceive the patent_examiner
instead the court cancelled the scheduled trial on the question of intent adopted an` inference' of intent and held the018_patent unenforceable on grounds of inequitable_conduct as a sanction for regenerons` litigation_misconduct' relating to discovery and the privilege_log during this litigation

the panel_majority acknowledges that` the district_court never held a second_trial to determine if regeneron acted with the specific_intent to deceive the pto during prosecution'
maj. op.at 1356
this absence of trial and trial findings on this critical issue can not be substituted by inference

nor is the appellate role to scour the appendix to fill the gap and make our own appellate finding of` intent to deceive'
here no evidentiary record was developed on intent to deceive with no testimony and no opportunity for examination and cross-examination of witnesses
the panel_majority instead engages in innuendo based on its careful selections from documents not admitted into evidence
the panel_majority thus convicts regeneron its counsel and its scientists with no trial no evidence and no opportunity to respond in their defense

materiality does not establish intent ; deliberate withholding of but-for invalidating prior_art with the intent to deceive the examiner must be established by clear and convincing_evidence
the majoritys mechanism whereby dispositive facts are found for the first time on appeal with no right of traverse by the affected party is contrary to fundamental fairness and judicial process

precedent is long-standing unambiguous and binding
in keystone driller co. v. general excavator co. 290_u.s._240 54_s.ct._146 78_l.ed._293_(1933) the court established that litigation_misconduct can support the dismissal of the suit whereas patent invalidity or unenforceability must be established on the law of validity or enforceability
applying keystone driller in aptix_corp. v. quickturn_design_systems inc. 269_f.3d_1369_(fed._cir._2001) this court held that [ t ] he remedies for litigation_misconduct bar the malfeasant who committed the misconduct

i also review the courts treatment of the four purportedly withheld references for they do not impart unpatentability to the claims and thus are not but-for material

the references cited by the examiner were fully explored during patent_prosecution ; the additional references do not add invalidating information
the018_patent is one of a family of patents directed to regenerons velocigene technology which uses quantitative assays to screen for dna recombination events
during prosecution the examiner cited seven references including u.s
application 11/009,873` lonberg' and u.s._patent_no._6114,598` kucherlapati' and considered u.s._patent_no._6130,364` jakobovits'
the examiner rejected all the claims of the018 application as anticipated by lonberg and obvious over lonberg in combination with three other_references including a bruggemann_reference dated four years after the allegedly withheld bruggemann_reference discussed post

lonberg was the examiners primary reference and teaches the introduction of immunoglobulin_transgenes into mouse cells
lonberg specifically discloses` constructing' a transgene composed of at least one variable gene segment one joining gene segment and one constant_region gene segment preferably of human origin
lonberg [ 0031 ] 2
these segments are` unrearranged' in that they are not` rearranged as to encode a functional immunoglobulin light or heavy_chain' but are not in germline_configuration
id
the lonberg transgene constructs may include regulatory_sequences from either the host i.e. murine or a related animal or from the exogenous i.e. human species
id.at *1368 [ 0033 ]
these transgenes are randomly integrated into the host mouse genome id.at [ 0292 ] and the resulting animals are then crossed with` knockout' mice-i.e. mice with a disrupted immunoglobulin_locus id.at [ 0296 ]
the result is that the cross-bred mice produce heterologous i.e. non-host antibodies

kucherlapati teaches methods of producing transgenic_animals in which the host_endogenous_immunoglobulin_locus is` substituted by a portion of or an entire xenogeneic_immunoglobulin_locus or may have a xenogeneic_immunoglobulin_locus inserted into a chromosome of the host cell and an inactivated endogenous immunoglobulin region'
kucherlapati col._3,_ll._51-55
kucherlapati teaches both random_integration and targeted_insertion of the immunoglobulin_locus
such xenogeneic immunoglobulin_loci are described as` human constant and/or variable_regions'
id.at col._5,_ll._51-54
kucherlapati teaches that the xenogeneic_locus` will be placed in substantially the same position as the analogous_host_locus so that any regulation associated with the position of the locus will be substantially the same for the xenogeneic_locus'
id.at col._10,_ll._51-55
as an example kucherlapati teaches retaining promoter and regulatory_regions of the host_dna
id.at col._10,_l._64- col._11,_l._2

the district_court referred to regenerons arguments before the european_patent_office about whether kucherlapati was enabled
dist
ct. op.at 577-78 citing meruss expert
the panel_majority cites regenerons arguments about kucherlapatis enablement in the prosecution of a different patent application u.s
application_no._1 3/719,819.3 maj. op.at 1355-56
however argument of kucherlapatis enablement does not appear in the prosecution record of the018 application
`` united_states patents-even those only asserted as prior_art in an invalidity defense-are presumed enabled'
amgen inc. v. hoechst marion roussel inc. 314_f.3d_1313 1354 fed
cir
2003
kucherlapati was thus presumed enabled before the examiner

the jakobovits_reference teaches the` use of cre-mediated site-specific recombination for modifying immunoglobulin_loci for instance to replace all or a part of either the constant_region or variable_region of an antibody_molecule'
jakobovits col._1,_ll._11-14
that is jakobovits teaches a method for targeted_insertion at an immunoglobulin_locus

the examiner in the` reasons for allowance' stated that` the prior_art does not teach or suggest a genetically modified mouse_comprising in its germline_cells human_unrearranged_variable_region_gene_segments inserted at an endogenous_mouse_immunoglobulin_locus'
j.a

no error has been ascribed to this finding

the purportedly withheld references were not more_material than the cited references
none of the purportedly withheld references provides teachings more_material than in the cited references
no purportedly withheld information was identified by the district_court or the panel_majority to teach a missing limitation or provide a motivation missing in the art

despite this failure the district_court held that the following uncited_references and information were material to patentability 1

certain opposition briefs filed by third_parties in the european_patent_office contesting patentability of ep no._1 360 287 ep287 the test for materiality is not whether references are directed to similar subject_matter ; the test is whether` the pto would not have allowed a claim had it been aware of the undisclosed_prior_art'
therasense 649 f.3d at 1291
that standard is not met here

neither the district_court nor my colleagues find that any uncited reference was closer to the claimed subject_matter than the cited references or filled gaps in the cited references or related to additional limitations in the claims
nor did the district_court find invalidity based on the uncited_references ; invalidity was based on the courts finding of indefiniteness not on obviousness over cited or uncited prior_art.4

the uncited_references do not provide additional information of but-for materiality with respect to the claimed technology
my colleagues suggest that because these four references were later cited by regeneron in the prosecution of related cases this is an admission that the references are material
surely it was prudent for regeneron to submit these citations to the examiner for consideration in any still-pending applications and regeneron states that it also submitted the district_courts opinion
that action can not be taken as an admission of but-for materiality

the parties debate several aspects of the broadest_reasonable_interpretation of claim terms but neither the district_courts nor my colleagues analysis shows that any` withheld reference' is more_material than the cited references
under the district_courts` broadest_reasonable_interpretation' the018 claims require a genetically modified mouse the genes of which have been modified using the particular large targeting vector method described in the specification by the insertion of human_variable_region_dna in its germline_configuration into or next to the endogenous_mouse_immunoglobulin_locus
dist
ct. op.at 564-67
the` withheld references' indeed relate to genetic modification but they are not but-for material as compared with the references before the examiner

the district_court does not establish that the allegedly withheld references lead to unpatentability
instead the district_court states that the references disclose motivations benefits and cumulative teachings
that is correct ; but the references do not provide but-for materiality whether taken alone or with the cited references

the velocigene project arose in a field of complex and unpredictable science with no consensus on how to produce therapeutically effective antibodies
the predictability of the state of the science relates to the materiality determination as the court has explained the methodology of science and the advance of technology are founded on the *1370 investigators educated application of what is known to intelligent exploration of what is not known
each case must be decided in its particular context including the characteristics of the science or technology its state of advance the nature of the known choices the specificity or generality of the prior_art and the predictability of results in the area of interest

recognition of the value of providing a murine source of antibodies with therapeutic effect in humans does not render the achievement obvious when it is ultimately successful

2004` recognition of a need does not render obvious the achievement that meets that need
``

nonetheless my colleagues find that these four cumulative references are but-for material and were intentionally withheld in order to deceive the examiner
that is insupportable as review demonstrates

i. bruggemann
bruggemann is a 1996 review_paper that collects the then-published methods of integrating immunoglobulin_transgenes into murine genomes
bruggemann concludes with a statement of hope for future achievement [ a ] n attractive_alternative would be to replace the mouse_ig_loci with the human_ig_loci ; in this way it might also be possible to retain and exploit any possible_regulatory_sequences in the mouse_loci that are located distal to protein-coding regions
while such ambitions have not yet been realized successful_replacement of small_portions of the mouse_genome have been described
bruggemann at 394
bruggemann also states [ i ] t is far from clear whether this [ ig loci replacement ] will be the best way to create a mouse strain giving rise to a wide-range of high-affinity antibodies
id.at 397
the district_court found that bruggemann taught 1 replacing` much of' the mouse_ig_locus with human_dna ; 2 an` explicit motivation' to exploit endogenous regulatory_sequences ; and 3 retaining an entirely human gene segment and an entirely murine gene segment
dist
ct. op.at 572 575
the district_court ignored bruggemanns statements that these results had not been achieved as well as that these elements are not required by the claims
see sri int l v. matsushita elec corp. 775_f.2d_1107 1121 fed
cir
1985 en banc` it is the claims that measure the invention
``

bruggemann does not teach unrearranged variable_region gene_segments in the germline_configuration nor does it teach any method-much less the ltvec_method required by the claims
indeed the district_courts finding of materiality of bruggemann is in conflict with the district_courts rejection of regenerons arguments that the claims require retaining the murine constant_region and require functional murine regulatory elements
bruggemanns statement of` unrealized_ambitions' of targeted replacement of the immunoglobulin_locus does not impart invalidating materiality when the ambitions are accomplished by regeneron

the jakobovits_reference teaches` replac [ ing ] all or a part of either the constant_region or variable_region of an antibody_molecule'
jakobovits col._1,_ll._11-14
kucherlapati also cited by the examiner teaches retaining promoter and regulatory_regions of the host_dna
kucherlapati col._10,_l._64- col._11,_l._2
the district_court found that kucherlapati and bruggemann were not cumulative stating *1371 bruggemann teaches the benefits of targeted_insertion as taking advantage of the regulatory_regions distal to the protein-coding regions and the expectation that mouse regulatory_sequences distal to the protein coding regions will remain intact
in contrast kucherlapati states that` the xenogeneic_locus will be placed substantially in the same_region as the analogous_host_locus so that any regulation associated with the position of the locus will be substantially the same for the xenogeneic_locus'
dist
ct. op.at 578 internal citations omitted
the district_court does not explain how this distinction converts bruggemann into an invalidating reference

the panel_majority adopts different and flawed reasoning finding that bruggemann shows` targeted gene_replacement' while kucherlapati shows` wholesale_replacement'
maj. op.at 1355-56
these` unrealized_ambitions' are not teachings of this long-sought result as the references readily demonstrate
moreover kucherlapati states that the host_endogenous_immunoglobulin_locus is` substituted by a portion of or an entire xenogeneic_immunoglobulin_locus' kucherlapati col._3,_ll._55 and describes the inserted dna as` human constant and/or variable_regions' id.at col._5,_ll._51-54 as does bruggemann

the panel_majority also incorrectly states that bruggemann suggests the method of zou to accomplish retaining and exploiting regulatory elements
the method of zou is cited only as an example of the` successful_replacement of small_portions of the mouse_genome' as opposed to a method to accomplish the` possibility' of inserting larger portions of the immunoglobulin_loci
bruggemann at 394
the panel_majoritys statement that zou is described as a method to retain and exploit regulatory_sequences is a misreading of both zou and bruggemann

ii
taki
taki is a 1993 article describing the then-knowledge of targeted_insertion of a rearranged murine variable_region construct at the immunoglobulin_locus
the rearranged gene inserted in the taki reference vh15 is derived from a murine antibody to phosphorylcholine
taki at 1268
in that early_work the taki transgenic_mouse produced fully murine antibodies to this particular antigen
the goal of this research was` exploration of immunoregulatory mechanisms' id. not the development of therapeutically useful human_antibodies

the district_court found that taki taught` the motivation to target human_variable_region_dna into the mouse_ig_locus'
dist
ct. op.at 574
taki indeed mentions this long-sought ambition
the panel_majority agrees stating that the` fact that taki teaches using exogenous_mouse_dna instead of exogenous_human_dna does not detract from the motivation_taki provides to target the mouse_ig_locus with exogenous_dna'
maj. op.at 1354
however a` motivation' to solve a known scientific problem is not a teaching of how to achieve that solution
`` knowledge of the goal does not render its achievement obvious'
abbott labs. 544 f.3d at 1352

the claims of the018_patent require human_dna not mouse_dna or any exogenous_dna
neither the district_court nor the panel_majority addresses the enormous difference between takis use of a single rearranged variable_region gene and the unrearranged variable_region gene segment in the018_patent
taki does not teach a mouse with unrearranged variable_region dna capable of recombination to create innumerable immune responses
taki does not teach the ltvec_method or human_unrearranged_variable_region_gene_segments in their germline_configuration
at most taki teaches targeted_insertion of *1372 a single gene of mouse_dna at the immunoglobulin_locus

the district_court recognized that taki` provides different motivations' than kucherlapati
dist
ct. op.at 578
taki reflects the early_work in this field ; it has been superseded by the teachings of kucherlapati and the other cited references
the record does not support the district_courts finding of materiality
the panel_majority errs in holding otherwise

iii
zou
zou teaches the targeted_insertion of a human_constant_region gene segment and uses the cre-loxp system to` replace the mouse gene c£^1 which encodes the constant_region of the heavy_chain of igg1 antibodies with its human counterpart'
zou at 1099
the district_court found zou to be but-for material because it` provides significant motivation to target the mouse_ig_locus with human_ig_dna'
dist
ct. op.at 575
the district_courts error was in equating the motivation to solve a known problem with teaching the solution to the problem

the district_court found that zou along with taki taught a` method' for inserting human_unrearranged_variable_region_gene_segments into an endogenous_mouse_immunoglobulin_locus
dist
ct. op.at 575
zou is cumulative of at least kucherlapati as well as jakobovits who teaches the same cre-loxp-mediated targeting of the immunoglobulin_locus as utilized by both zou and the018_patent5 jakobovits col._1,_ll._11-14
kucherlapati teaches that the xenogeneic human locus is` substituted' in` substantially the same_region as the analogous_host_locus'
kucherlapati col._10,_ll._50-55
zou does not add but-for material_information to these references
zou and jakobovits use the same method of targeted_insertion ; zou is not alleged to teach a missing limitation but only to provide a` motivation' to target the immunoglobulin_locus
again` [ k ] nowledge of the goal does not render its achievement obvious'
abbott labs. 544 f.3d at 1352
the district_courts contrary ruling is incorrect as is the panel_majoritys endorsement of that ruling.6

iv
wood
wood describes a transgenic_mouse having unrearranged human_dna fragments incorporated into its germline
wood teaches the use of either constructed unrearranged gene fragments or the use of contiguous unrearranged human_dna
wood col._16,_ll._14-22
wood does not describe how such gene fragments are` introduced' or` integrated' into the germline of the described mouse ; wood does not teach targeted_insertion

the district_court found that wood teaches the` insertion of human_variable_region_gene_segments upstream of an endogenous mouse_constant_region to produce a genetically modified mouse' and` motivates a person of ordinary_skill to use an endogenous mouse constant £g mu region for purposes of allelic exclusion'
dist
ct. op.at 572-73
both the district_court and the panel_majority misread wood

*1373 wood teaches a` dna_fragment_construct' with murine constant_regions upstream from the human_variable_region_gene_segments
building a dna construct in a particular order to be later inserted is not the same as describing the targeted_insertion of that construct into germline dna
wood does not describe any targeted_insertion_method described elsewhere in the prior_art such as cre-loxp
the district_court excuses this absence because wood` is appropriately understood as including but not limiting insertion at the ig_locus'
dist
ct. op.at 573

woods teaching of a` dna construct' was misread as teaching the targeted_insertion of that construct at a particular portion of the endogenous_locus
the wood teaching of` integration' into the genome is cumulative of lonberg and other_references which broadly teach` integration' into the genome
lonberg [ 0292 ]
there is no support in wood for the leap from a broad unspecified disclosure of` integration' somewhere into the genome to the district_courts finding of disclosure of targeted_insertion at the ig_locus

neither my colleagues nor the district_court explains how an examiner would have tied together the conflicting approaches and unrealized_ambitions of the four purportedly omitted references to render obvious the method described and claimed in the018_patent

v. european opposition briefs
the european opposition briefs were filed in the european_patent_office in an opposition proceeding associated with ep287 a counterpart of the regeneron technology
the merus opposition brief cited the references cited by the united_states examiner and additional references in this busy field of science including the same bruggeman taki zou and wood references
the district_court stated that the` faithful'` description' of the allegedly withheld references in the european opposition would` have led inexorably to an understanding of their relevance and but-for materiality'
dist
ct. op.at 577

it is noteworthy that the european technical board of appeals ruled that ep287 was patentable over these allegedly withheld references
see decision in appeal no
t2220/14-3.3.08 at 67-68 taki ; 71-72 bruggemann ; 72-77 wood ; and 77-78 zou available at http //www.epo.org/law-practice/case-law-appeals/pdf/t142220eu1.pdf
these determinations negate but-for materiality as well as the district_courts analysis
perhaps this is why the panel_majority chose not to discuss the european opposition
maj. op.at 1350 n.3

there is no support-legally or factually-for the district_courts reliance on the european opposition briefs to find these four references material to patentability
the european tribunal with these references before it did not find the claims unpatentable
nor did the district_court
the panel_majority upholds a finding of but-for materiality without finding the claims invalid based on these purported but-for material references
it is not disputed that the information in those references did not solve the problem that was ultimately solved by the018_patent

conclusion
the controlling precedent of aptix v. quickturn supra and keystone driller supra can not be ignored by this panel
although my colleagues make much of the purported` litigation_misconduct' relating to the privilege_log and discovery in this infringement litigation this has no relation to whether there was inequitable_conduct in the prosecution before the patent_examiner
intent to deceive the examiner can not be inferred from purported litigation_misconduct several years later

*1374 the premises of the law of inequitable_conduct have not been established by clear and convincing_evidence
intent to withhold material references in order to deceive the examiner was not found by the district_court and can not be inferred
these four additional references were not but-for material to patentability and specific_intent to deceive was not shown
