opinion
baldwin senior_circuit_judge
this is an appeal by plaintiff applied materials inc. applied from the final *280 judgment of the united_states_district_court for the northern_district of california granting the motions for summary_judgment of defendant gemini research corporation gemini
applied sued gemini for infringement of four patents related to apparatus and methods of chemical_vapor_deposition cvd
gemini filed four motions for summary_judgment challenging the validity of applieds patents
the district_court granted two of these motions invalidating all four patents and entered a final judgment in favor of gemini
we vacate and remand

background
applied contends that gemini has infringed u.s. patent nos._3623,712712_patent 4,047,496496_patent 4,081,313313_patent and 4,496,609609_patent
the four patents in suit all grew out of a single application filed by mcneilly and benzing on october 15 1969
the united_states_patent and trademark office pto required the application be restricted a requirement that resulted in three applications each claiming a patentably distinct invention a radiation heated reactor issued as the712_patent a cvd_gas_reactant_reactor issued as the496_patent and a cvd coating process including both method and apparatus_claims issued as the609 and313_patent s
applied elected to prosecute the radiantly heated cvd reactor claims which appear in the712_patent issued in november 1971

a divisional_application was filed for the cvd_gas_reactant_reactor
after two continuation_applications and the execution of a terminal disclaimer the application for the cvd_gas_reactant_reactor issued in september 1977 as the496_patent

a second divisional_application was filed for the coating process followed by a continuation-in-part application which inter alia included the addition of locke as an inventor
the examiner issued a second restriction requirement resulting in separate applications for the coating method claims for which locke was a joint inventor and the coating apparatus_claims
applied elected to prosecute the coating apparatus_claims

a divisional_application was filed for the coating method claims with mcneilly benzing and locke as the inventors
after another continuation_application and another restriction requirement the313_patent issued in march 1978

a continuation_application was filed for the coating apparatus_claims
locke was deleted as an inventor
the examiner rejected these claims as prima_facie obvious
the united_states_patent and trademark office board of patent_appeals and interferences and the united_states_court of customs and patent_appeals ccpa in re mcneilly 612_f.2d_585_(c.c.p.a.1979) affirmed the rejections
finally after two more continuation_applications and the introduction of new_evidence to rebut the finding of prima_facie obviousness the609_patent issued in january 1985

gemini requested summary_judgment on the invalidity of the four patents in suit in four motions on the following grounds respectively 1 the609712 and496_patent s are invalid on the theory of collateral_estoppel and res judicata* in view of in re mcneilly ; 2 the313_patent is invalid because of anticipation under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 e ; 3 inequitable conduct on the part of applied in prosecuting the applications of these patents ; and 4 double patenting
the district_court granted the first two motions the third was not decided and the fourth was withdrawn
only the two motions that were granted are at issue in this appeal

issues
1
whether the district_court erred in holding invalid under the doctrine of collateral_estoppel the609_patent because the ccpa affirmed the rejection of the claims of a parent application and the712 and496_patent s because these patents claim the apparatus used in the process claimed in the609_patent

*281 2
whether the district_court erred in holding the712_patent as prior_art with respect to the313_patent and the313_patent to be anticipated by the712_patent under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 e

opinion
the609_patent
the district_court determined that the claims of the609_patent were barred by the collateral_estoppel_effects of in re mcneilly
this conclusion was based on its finding that the new_evidence introduced by applied in its continuation_applications did not give rise to any genuine issues of material fact regarding obviousness ; therefore the changes made in the continuation_applications were not material as a matter of law
we disagree
the district_court erred in not giving proper weight to the patents presumption of validity
35 u.s.c.¡± 282 1982
the presumption of validity carries with it the assumption that the evidence considered by the pto when granting the patent was material
in considering a summary_judgment motion since the facts must be construed in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party united states v. diebold inc. 369_u.s._654 655 82_s.ct._993 994 8_l.ed.2d_176_(1962) the record must show conclusively that the new_evidence was immaterial
in this case nothing in the record indicates this
therefore the holding by the district_court that the609_patent is invalid due to collateral_estoppel is vacated

the712 and496_patent s. the district_court held invalid the712 and496_patent s on the basis of its determination of invalidity of the609_patent
in light of our holding on the collateral_estoppel_effects of in re mcneilly on the609_patent we also vacate the district_courts holding as to the collateral_estoppel_effects of that decision on the712 and496_patent s

the313_patent
the district_court found the712_patent fully anticipated the invention claimed in the313_patent
this finding was based on its determination that the invention claimed in the712_patent attributed to mcneilly and benzing was invented by a different` inventive entity' than that listed in the313_patent namely mcneilly benzing and locke
however the fact that an application has named a different inventive entity than a patent does not necessarily make that patent prior_art
as this court held in in re kaplan 789_f.2d_1574 229_uspq_678_(fed_cir.1986) when the joint and sole inventions are related as they are here inventor a commonly discloses the invention of a & b in the course of describing his sole invention and when he so describes the invention of a & b he is not disclosing` prior_art' to the a & b invention even if he has legal status as` another' [ 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 e ]
id.at 1576 229 uspq at 680 quoting in re land 368_f.2d_866 879 151_uspq_621 633 ccpa 1966 emphasis in original
even though an application and a patent have been conceived by different inventive entities if they share one or more persons as joint inventors the 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 e exclusion for a patent granted to` another' is not necessarily satisfied

in this case the applications which matured into the712 and313_patent s all grew from the same original application
accordingly if the invention claimed in the313_patent is fully disclosed in the712_patent this invention had to be invented before the filing date of the712_patent and the latter can not be 102 e prior_art to the313_patent
see land 368 f.2d at 879 151 uspq at 633` when the 102 e reference patentee [712 ].. had knowledge of the joint applicants invention [313 ] by being one of them and thereafter describes it he necessarily files the application [` 712 ] after the [313 ] applicants invention date..' emphasis in original
thus the district_court erred because it invalidity decision was based on the incorrect premise that the712_patent was 102 e prior_art against the313_patent

conclusion
the judgment entered by the district_court invalidating the four patents is vacated and the case is remanded

vacated and remanded
