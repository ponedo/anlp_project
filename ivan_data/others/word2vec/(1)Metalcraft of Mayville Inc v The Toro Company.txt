background
metalcraft of mayville inc. d/b/a scag_power_equipment` scag' manufactures commercial riding lawnmowers
to improve its mowers scag developed a suspended operator_platform which is disclosed and claimed in the475_patent
the475_patent discloses a suspended operator_platform for a ride-on lawnmower or other riding light_utility_vehicle connected to a rigid_chassis by a suspension_system
'475_patent at abstract 2:33-34
the operator_platform supports the entire_body of the operator
id.at 2:51-52
the suspension_system suspends the operator_platform from the chassis in a manner that *1363 isolates an operator from vibrations or shock_loads generated by the mower during use or when driven over uneven terrain
id.at 4:1-6
the operator_platform can suspend or isolate some controls from the rigid_chassis
id.at 2:37-39
for example the patent teaches that the steering_controls may be mounted on the suspended platform
id.at 2:39-41

scag commercialized the system disclosed in the475_patent in its cheetah_line of lawnmowers
in 2015 both the toro_company and its wholly owned subsidiary exmark_manufacturing_co. inc. collectively` toro' introduced riding lawnmowers with suspended operator_platforms to compete with scags cheetah_line
toro introduced the platform as part of its new myride tm suspension_system and exmark introduced the platform as an upgrade to its lazer z series lawnmowers
it is undisputed that the steering_controls in toro and exmarks riding lawnmowers are connected to the chassis not the operator_platform

on may_5,_2016 scag filed an infringement_action against toro in the eastern_district of wisconsin and simultaneously filed a motion for a preliminary_injunction to enjoin toro from making using selling and offering to sell lawnmowers with platform_suspension_systems that infringe its475_patent
on august 1 the district_court granted scags motion for a preliminary_injunction
on august 4 toro filed a notice of appeal and a motion to stay entry of the preliminary_injunction
the district_court denied toros motion to stay entry of the injunction and granted scags motion to set bond and enter the injunction order

asserted independent claims 11 14 and 21 all claim` an operator_platform that supports the seat and an entire_body of an operator during use of the utility vehicle'
'475_patent at 12:4-5 12:27-28 13:10-11
in opposing scags motion for a preliminary_injunction toro did not dispute that its accused mowers meet the asserted patent claims except with respect to one limitation
j.a
374
toro argued its accused mowers do not infringe because the accused devices do not meet the limitation` an entire_body of an operator'
id
it argued its mowers lack this limitation because the steering_controls of the accused mowers are mounted to the chassis not the operator_platform and therefore the operators hands and arms are not supported by the platform
j.a
375-77

the district_court concluded that metalcraft was likely to succeed on the infringement issue
j.a
14
it acknowledged toros argument but concluded that` the fact that the defendants lawnmowers have steering_controls attached to the chassis as opposed to the operator_platform is not a defense to infringement'
j.a
12
it construed` an operator_platform that supports.. an entire_body of an operator'` in reference to how a person sits in an ordinary chair'
id

on appeal toro argues the district_court erroneously rejected toros noninfringement_defense because the courts construction of` an entire_body of an operator' excludes the operators hands and arms
we disagree
nowhere did the district_court conclude that` an entire_body of an operator' excluded the operators arms and hands.1

the district_court correctly determined that the claims at issue do not require that *1365 the steering_controls be mounted on the suspended operator_platform
a review of the claims at issue demonstrates that none of them contain such a limitation
unasserted dependent claims in contrast contain limitations that require the steering_controls be connected to the operator_platform
see e.g. dependent claim 12
the claims also delineate between two structurally separate elements the operator_platform that supports the seat and the entire_body of the operator and the steering_controls
see id
( requiring that the steering_controls be connected to and move in unison with the operator_platform
the steering_controls are not claimed as a component of the operator_platform
moreover the specification makes clear that the operator_platform supports the entire_body and that steering_controls are connected to but not part of the operator_platform
the specification consistently distinguishes the operator_platform from components that may be attached to it such as the steering_controls
'475_patent at 2:39-40` steering_controls may be mounted on the suspended platform' ; id.at 2:51-55 ; id.at 5:3-5` [ s ] teering controls 55 include a pair of levers 58a 58b that are pivotally attached to the operator_platform 70' ; id.at 6:9-10` the components attached to the operator_platform 70 such as steering_controls 55'
the475_patent makes clear that it is the suspended operator_platform that supports` an entire_body of an operator' and that the operator_platform is a separate and distinct element from the steering_controls
in light of the claims and the specification we reject toros claim_construction argument

toro also argues that the` entire_body of an operator' limitation requires the steering_controls be mounted on the operator_platform or else the operators hands will not be isolated from shock_loads
it argues that since its accused mowers have steering_controls connected to the chassis its mowers do not isolate the operators entire_body from shock_loads and therefore do not meet the` entire_body of an operator' limitation
toro improperly equates supporting the entire_body of an operator with isolating every aspect of an operators body from shock_loads

no doubt the475_patent discusses the advantages of isolating an operators body from shock_loads
however the475_patent treats supporting the entire_body of an operator and isolating the operator from shock_loads as two distinct aspects of the claimed invention
referring to figures 1_and_2 the specification states that the mower includes a suspension_system that` suspends the operator_platform 70 from the chassis in a manner that isolates an operator from vibrations or shock-type or other loads'
'475_patent at 4:1-4 emphasis added
this is different from when it refers again to figures 1_and_2 and states` suspension_system 100 is configured to support an entire_body of the operator the operator_platform 70 and the components attached to the operator_platform 70 such as steering_controls 55'
id.at 6:7-10 emphasis added
the475_patent uses precise language to differentiate between the distinct concepts of supporting and isolating with respect to other elements as well
the specification states` with yet another aspect of the invention an operators seat is vibrationally isolated from a suspended operator_platform' and` [ i ] solating the mower deck 20 from the suspension_system 100 prevents scalping'
id.at 3:1-3 *1366 6:22-23 emphases added
in contrast the specification states` [ a ] drive train is supported in a generally rigid manner in chassis 10' and` [ m ] ower deck 20 is supported by frame 12'
id.at 4:9-10 4:14-15 emphases added

finally the claim language itself keeps these concepts separate
in contrast to asserted claims 11 14 and 21 which claim` an operator_platform that supports the seat and an entire_body of an operator' claim 5 requires` a seat and at least one elastomeric isolation mount connecting the seat to the operator_platform to reduce transmission of vibrations therebetween'
since the475_patent discerns between the inventions functionality of supporting versus isolating from vibrations we may not import into the entire_body of an operator limitation a functional requirement that every part of the body be isolated from shock_loads
it would be improper to import the isolation feature into the separate entire_body limitation as toro asks us to do
as a result we conclude that the district_court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting toros noninfringement_defense and determining that metalcraft had established a likelihood of success on infringement

substantial question of validity
obviousness is a question of law based upon underlying factual determinations which we review for clear_error
senju pharm co. v. lupin_ltd. 780_f.3d_1337 1341 fed
cir
2015
a claim is invalid for obviousness` if the differences between the claimed invention and the prior_art are such that the claimed invention as a whole would have been obvious before the effective filing date of the claimed invention to a person having ordinary_skill in the art to which the claimed invention pertains'
35 u.s.c.¡± 103
in determining whether there would have been a motivation to combine prior_art references to arrive at the claimed invention it is insufficient to simply conclude the combination would have been obvious without identifying any reason why a person of skill in the art would have made the combination
see in re van os 844_f.3d_1359 1361 fed
cir
2017
whether a skilled_artisan would have been motivated to combine the references is a question of fact
apple_inc. 839 f.3d at 1051

toro argued that claim 21 would have been obvious in light of u.s. patent no._3420,568` henriksson' and japanese patent application no
jp55-69340` sasaki'
henriksson discloses a device for resilient support of a drivers compartment mounted on a vehicle frame to provide vertical movement to cushion the driver from shocks absorbed by the vehicle from the earth or road
henriksson at 1:15-25
sasaki discloses a device for adjusting an initial load of a spring in a damper used in a rear-wheel suspension_system of a motorcycle or the like
sasaki at 2

toro argued that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have been motivated to combine henriksson and sasaki
it argued that while henriksson does not disclose dual fine and course adjusters as claimed by claim 21,2 dual shock adjusters were well-known in the prior_art
j.a
379
it presented sasaki as prior_art that discloses shock absorbers with both fine and course adjustment
id

*1367 the district_court rejected toros motivation to combine argument
it recognized that` a patentcomposed of several elements is not proved obvious merely by demonstrating that each of its elements was independently known in the prior_art` and that` it can be important to identify a reason that would have prompted a person of ordinary_skill in the relevant field to combine the elements in the way the claimed new invention does'
j.a
13-14 quoting ksr int l co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 418-19 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007)
it concluded that toro failed to raise a substantial_question of validity stating toro offered` no reason and the court can not imagine one that a person of ordinary_skill in this field would combine a motorcycle shock with a suspended truck cab and come up with a suspended operator_platform'
j.a
13-14

on appeal toro argues the district_courts analysis is inconsistent with ksr 550 u.s. at 420-21 127_s.ct._1727 which stated` the idea that a designer hoping to make an adjustable electronic pedal would ignore asano because asano was designed to solve the constant ratio problem makes little sense
a person of ordinary_skill is also a person of ordinary creativity not an automaton'
toro argues it would have been obvious to a person of skill in the art to combine henriksson and sasaki because henriksson sought to solve the problem of transmission of shock_loads to the operator and specified conventional and telescope-type shock absorbers as methods of reducing shock_loads

we hold that the district_courts finding that there would not have been a motivation to combine is not clearly erroneous
the district_court correctly acknowledged that it is not enough for toro to merely demonstrate that elements of the claimed invention were independently known in the prior_art
often every element of a claimed invention can be found in the prior_art
in re kotzab 217_f.3d_1365 1370 fed
cir
2000
moreover toro merely identifies a problem that henriksson sought to solve
however` knowledge of a problem and motivation to solve it are entirely different from motivation to combine particular_references'
innogenetics n.v. v. abbott_labs. 512_f.3d_1363 1373 fed
cir
2008

we agree with the district_court that toro provides no explanation or reasoning for concluding that one of skill in the art would have combined these particular_references to produce the claimed invention
without any explanation as to how or why the references would be combined to arrive at the claimed invention we are left with only hindsight bias that ksr warns against
see ksr 550 u.s. at 421 127_s.ct._1727
and while we understand that` [ t ] he obviousness analysis can not be confined by a formalistic conception of the words teaching suggestion and motivation' we also recognize that we can not allow hindsight bias to be the thread that stitches together prior_art patches into something that is the claimed invention
see ksr 550 u.s. at 419 421 127_s.ct._1727
for these reasons we conclude that the district_court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting toros obviousness defense and determining that toro did not raise a substantial_question of validity

toro also argued below that henriksson anticipates claims 11_and_14
the district_court found that henriksson` discloses a heavy-duty truck with a drivers compartment not an operator_platform as described by claims 11_and_14` and therefore is not an anticipatory reference
j.a
13
toro challenges the district_courts finding

*1368 we decline to address the anticipation issue
a party may establish a likelihood of success by showing that at least one valid and enforceable patent claim is likely to be infringed
abbott_labs
v. andrx pharm. inc. 473_f.3d_1196 1201 fed
cir
2007
because asserted claim 21 covers the accused products and because we conclude that the district_court did not abuse its discretion in determining that metalcraft established a likelihood of success as to infringement and validity with respect to claim 21 we need not reach the anticipation arguments regarding claims 11_and_14 to sustain the injunction as to claim 21 which reaches all of the accused products

b. irreparable harm
a party seeking a preliminary_injunction must establish that it is likely to suffer irreparable_harm if the preliminary_injunction is not granted and there is a causal nexus between the alleged infringement and the alleged harm
apple_inc. v. samsung_elecs co. 735_f.3d_1352 1360 fed
cir
2013
evidence of potential lost sales alone does not demonstrate irreparable_harm
see abbott_labs
v. andrx pharm. inc. 452_f.3d_1331 1348 fed
cir
2006
evidence showing that no amount of monetary damages however great could address the harm tends to show it is an irreparable_harm
see celsis in vitro inc. v. cellzdirect inc. 664_f.3d_922 930 fed
cir
2012
where the injury can not be quantified no amount of money damages is calculable and therefore the harm can not be adequately compensated and is irreparable

the district_court determined that scag is likely to suffer irreparable_harm in the absence of a preliminary_injunction because` it is impossible to quantify the damages caused by the loss of a potentially lifelong_customer'
j.a
15
toro argues the district_court abused its discretion by ignoring evidence it presented of at least twelve other_companies that sell mowers designed to decrease shock_loads to the operator
it also argues the court erred in accepting scags argument that brand loyalty resulted in the loss of` a potentially lifelong_customer' and there are no facts to support this finding
we do not find toros arguments persuasive

there is no requirement that the district_court discuss every fact alleged by toro
see fresenius usa inc. v. baxter int l inc. 582_f.3d_1288 1303 fed
cir
2009
even if toro means to allege that these twelve other_companies have infringing lawnmowers that compete with scags` [ t ] he fact that other infringers may be in the marketplace does not negate irreparable_harm'
pfizer inc. v. teva_pharm
usa inc. 429_f.3d_1364 1381 fed
cir
2005
furthermore the district_court determined` the damage to scag is irreparable because it is impossible to quantify the damages caused by the loss of a potentially lifelong_customer'
j.a
15
the fact that toros own senior marketing manager declared that some customers` prefer to purchase an entire line of products from the same manufacturer for consistency' supports the courts determination
j.a
15 citing j.a
432 ?
7
the district_court did not clearly err on this record ; the loss by scag of customers may have far-reaching long-term impact on its future revenues and the sales lost by scag are difficult to quantify due to`ecosystem effects where one companys customers will continue to buy that companys products and recommend them to others'
apple_inc. v. samsung_elecs co. 809_f.3d_633 641 645 fed
cir
2015
`` because of its variable *1369 and uncertain nature this loss is very difficult to calculate'
id
therefore the district_court did not abuse its discretion in holding that scag is likely to suffer irreparable_harm in the absence of an injunction

c. balance of equities and the public interest
a party seeking a preliminary_injunction must establish that` the balance of equities_tips in [ its ] favor and that an injunction is in the public_interest'
luminara 814 f.3d at 1352
the district_court must weigh the harm to the moving party if the injunction is not granted against the harm to the non-moving party if the injunction is granted
hybritech inc. v. abbott_labs. 849_f.2d_1446 1457 fed
cir
1988
it is within the courts discretion to balance the equities
atlas powder co. v. ireco chems. 773_f.2d_1230 1234 fed
cir
1985
in considering whether the public_interest favors the grant of an injunction the district_court should focus on whether a critical public_interest would be injured by the grant of injunctive_relief
hybritech 849 f.2d at 1458

the district_court identified the harms that toro asserted it would suffer if enjoined as those associated with losing a patent infringement lawsuit
j.a
17
it recognized that in the absence of an injunction scag would face substantial hardship in being forced` to compete against its own patented invention'
j.a
16-17
it concluded that scags harm in the absence of an injunction outweighs toros harm if enjoined
j.a
17
it also concluded that in light of the importance of encouraging innovation and in light of the fact that the public can continue to obtain the patented suspension_system from scag or other non-infringing mowers from toro the public_interest favors the issuance of an injunction
id

toro argues that its harm outweighs scags and the injunction harms the public because it disrupts the status quo by removing from the public lawnmowers that had been available for over a year

we are not persuaded that the district_courts contrary determination was an abuse of discretion and decline to disturb the grant of the preliminary_injunction on these bases

d. content and scope of the injunction
pursuant to rule 65 d 1 of the federal rules of civil procedure every order granting an injunction must` state the reasons why it issued ; state its terms specifically ; and describe in reasonable detail-and not by referring to the complaint or other document-the act or acts restrained or required'
`` [ w ] hether the terms of an injunction fulfill the mandates of rule 65 d is a question of law that we review without deference'

j.a

toro argues the district_courts *1370 preliminary_injunction is overly broad
we do not agree
the decision and order in which the district_court grants the motion for the preliminary_injunction discusses both the claims at issue as well as the defendants accused products which it enjoins
j.a
6-18

claim 21 was argued to cover all the accused products and toro has made no meaningful arguments which delineated among the accused products
we have affirmed the district_courts conclusion that the patentee has established a likelihood of success that the accused products infringe claim 21 and that there is not a substantial_question of validity as to claim 21
in such a case we affirm the preliminary_injunction as to the accused products

conclusion
for the foregoing reasons we hold that the district_court did not abuse its discretion in granting scags motion for a preliminary_injunction
accordingly we affirm the district_courts grant of injunctive_relief on claim 21 as to the accused products
