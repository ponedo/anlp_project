opinion
rader circuit_judge
on summary_judgment the united_states_district_court for the western_district of wisconsin ruled that defendants fosber_america inc. fosber_spa and united_container_machinery inc. did not infringe u.s._patent_no._4200,276 the276_patent under the doctrine of equivalents
see marquip inc. v. fosber_america inc. no._96-_c-726-s w.d.wis

1998 order
because the district_court properly concluded as a matter of law that the claims at issue can not cover the accused device under the doctrine of equivalents this court affirms
this court also affirms the district_courts denial of the rule 60 b motion because the district_court did not abuse its discretion

i
the276_patent claims a method and device for shingling and stacking corrugated_paperboard_sheets without interrupting the continuous flow of sheets
because the corrugator runs continuously it is difficult to remove completed stacks of sheets without interrupting the flow of the corrugator
the invention solves this problem by creating a gap in the flow of sheets
the gap allows sufficient time to discharge a completed stack without interrupting the corrugator
claims 9_and_13 the only two claims at issue recite a method and a device respectively for automatically *1365 changing the speed of the conveyor_belts to create a gap 9
in the method of conveying sheets in succession from a first_location along a plurality of separate in-line_conveyors to a stacker wherein a vertical_stack of a predetermined_number of sheets is to be formed and wherein said plurality of conveyors are traveling at the same_speed the steps of a shingling said sheets as they pass said location to form a group of shingled sheets for stacking b increasing the speed of said group of shingled sheets c and slowing each said separate in-line_conveyor individually and seccessively [ sic ] in a downstream_direction in response to passage of the trailing end of said group past the end of each respective_separate_conveyor to thereby slow sheets traveling upstream of said group of sheets

in a device for conveying sheets in succession from a first_location along a plurality of separate in-line_conveyors to a stacker wherein a vertical_stack of a predetermined_number of sheets is to be formed and wherein said plurality of conveyors are traveling at the same_speed the combination comprising a means for shingling said sheets as they pass said location to form a group of shingled sheets for stacking b means for increasing the speed of said group of shingled sheets c and means for slowing each said separate in-line_conveyor individually and successively in a downstream_direction in response to passage of the trailing end of said group past the end of each respective_separate_conveyor to thereby slow sheets traveling upstream of said group of sheets
'276_patent col._7,_ll._22-39 ; col._8,_ll._31-47 emphasis added

marquip asserts that versions 1 2 3 and 4 of the fosber_device infringe claims 9_and_13 of the276_patent
both parties rely on a stipulated description of the process in the accused fosber_devices
version 2 is the most basic of the fosber_devices
in version 2 a` shingling nip' continuously shingles or overlaps sheets onto a moving conveyor
the first_conveyor moves the shingled sheets to a second_conveyor which moves at the same_speed as the first
the fosber_device has an interrupt_mechanism between the first and second_conveyors
this mechanism grasps and holds some sheets to create a gap in the flow of sheets
specifically when the trailing end of the last_sheet in a predetermined_number of sheets the preceding group moves past the pinch point of the interrupt_mechanism the mechanism grabs and stops the next sheet
this action creates a gap and starts the next_group of a predetermined_number of sheets the succeeding group

at about the same_time the interrupter grasps the first sheet in the next_group two other events also occur 1 the second_conveyor and all other conveyors downstream of the interrupt_mechanism speed up carrying the preceding group toward a stacker at the end of the conveyors and 2 the first_conveyor slows down
when the preceding group leaves the third_conveyor the second_conveyor slows again to the pace of the first_conveyor and the interrupt_mechanism releases the succeeding group
similarly the third_conveyor slows when the preceding group passes the fourth_conveyor
the fourth_conveyor slows when the preceding group is on a downstacker at the end of the conveyors
the downstacker discharges the preceding group from the stacker and makes room for a new stack

fosbers version 1 differs from version 2 only in the location of the interrupt_mechanism-namely midway along the second_conveyor
when the interrupt_mechanism closes the interrupt_mechanism itself moves at the same_speed as the first_conveyor
in version 1 the second_conveyor operates exactly the same as in version 2 namely speeding up to widen *1366 the gap
version 3 is the same as version 1 except that two conveyors replace the first_conveyor but they always run at the same_speed
version 4 is the same as version 2 except that again two conveyors replace the first_conveyor and always run at the same_speed
for purposes of this opinion it suffices to discuss version 2 as representative of all fosber_devices which contain an interrupt_mechanism and conveyors with varying speeds

at the initial_trial the district_court considered two of marquips patents the276_patent and u.s._patent_no._4273,325
the district_court granted summary_judgment that fosber did not infringe the two patents either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents
see marquip inc. v. fosber_america inc. no._96-_c-726-s w.d.wis
june_10,_1997 order marquip_i
when marquip appealed marquip_i this court affirmed the district_courts grant of summary_judgment that fosber did not literally infringe the276_patent but vacated the summary_judgment of non-infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
see marquip inc. v. fosber_america inc. 155_f.3d_567 1998_wl_314628 no._97-1441 fed.cir.1998 marquip_ii
as part of the ruling this court construed the limitation` group' as an accumulation of a predetermined_number of sheets
on remand the district_court again granted summary_judgment of non-infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
see marquip inc. v. fosber_america inc. no._96-_c-726-s w.d.wis
sept.14 1998 order marquip_iii

the critical issue in marquip_iii was whether element c of claims 9_and_13 covered the fosber_device
the district_court concluded that the fosber_device performs the recited function of slowing the conveyors and obtains the result of decreasing the speed of the sheets traveling upstream
see id.at 10
the district_court determined however that the fosber_device performs the function` in a fundamentally different_way'
id
in particular the district_court held that` [ t ] he presence of a functional interrupt_mechanism [ in the fosber_device ] not the minimal change in timing required by its presence is that which makes defendants machines operate in a substantially different_way' from the claimed inventions
id.at 13
marquip appeals

in a separate appeal marquip appeals the district_courts refusal to set aside final_judgment under fed.r.civ.p
60 b
see marquip inc. v. fosber_america inc. no._96-_c-726-s w.d.wis
dec.8 1998 order marquip_iv
marquip based its motion on newly discovered evidence about the fosber_device allegedly withheld by fosber during discovery
this court consolidates the two appeals and addresses both the infringement and rule 60 b issues in this opinion

ii
this court reviews a district_courts grant of summary_judgment without deference
see conroy v. reebok int l ltd. 14_f.3d_1570 1575 29_uspq2d_1373 1377 fed.cir.1994
summary judgment requires the moving party to show both the absence of genuine issues of material_fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law
see fed.r.civ.p
56 c
in reviewing the district_courts summary_judgment this court draws all reasonable inferences from the evidence in favor of the non-movant marquip
see anderson v. liberty lobby inc. 477_u.s._242 255 106_s.ct._2505 91_l.ed.2d_202_(1986)

to infringe under the doctrine of equivalents the accused product must contain each claim element or its equivalent
see warner-jenkinson_co. v. hilton_davis_chem co. 520_u.s._17 40 117_s.ct._1040 137_l.ed.2d_146 41_uspq2d_1865 1875 1997
the accused product is equivalent to a claimed element if the differences between the two are` insubstantial' to one of ordinary skill in the art
id.at 39-40 117_s.ct._1040 ; *1367 hilton_davis_chem co. v. warner-jenkinson_co. 62_f.3d_1512 1517 35_uspq2d_16411644 fed.cir.1995 en banc revd on other grounds 520_u.s._17 117_s.ct._1040 137_l.ed.2d_146 1997

based on the fundamental principle that no one deserves an exclusive_right to technology already in the public domain this court has consistently limited the doctrine of equivalents to prevent its application to ensnare prior_art
see wilson_sporting_goods v. david geoffrey & assoc. 904_f.2d_677 683 14_uspq2d_1942 1948 fed.cir.1990
in wilson_sporting_goods this court explained the reasons prior_art limits the range of equivalents
at the outset this court posed the question` if the doctrine of equivalents does not involve expanding the claims why should the prior_art be a limitation on the range of permissible_equivalents ?'
id.at 684 emphasis in original
the answer to the question this court explained was not that courts construe claims narrowly to preserve their validity ; application of the doctrine of equivalents is not a claim interpretation process
see id
rather the reason for the limitation is to prevent the patentee from obtaining under the doctrine of equivalents coverage it could not have obtained from the patent and trademark office pto by literal claims
because prior_art limits the exclusive_right available to an inventor it also limits the range of permissible_equivalents of a claim
see id

as a helpful illustration of the operation of this limitation on the doctrine of equivalents this court visualized a hypothetical patent claim sufficient in scope to cover literally the accused device
see id
; key mfg group inc. v. microdot inc. 925_f.2d_1444 1449 17_uspq2d_1806 1810 fed.cir.1991` while not obligatory in every doctrine of equivalents determination the hypothetical_claim rationale.. helps define the limits imposed by prior_art on the range of equivalents`
then this court examined whether the pto would have allowed that hypothetical_claim over the prior_art at the time of invention
see wilson_sporting_goods 904 f.2d at 684
if the claim would have been allowed then prior_art is not a bar to infringement by equivalents
if the claim would not have been allowed prior_art bars a finding of infringement

in this case the district_court found that the application of the doctrine of the equivalents to encompass fosbers device would ensnare technology in the prior_art at the time of marquips invention
specifically the district_court found that the vermes prior_art patent u.s._patent_no._4040,618 limits the range of permissible_equivalents
vermes teaches a sheet stacker with conveyor_belts and an interrupt device
specifically vermes discloses [ t ] he frictional interrupter bar 90 is the sole means used to interrupt the flow of sheets during the stack transfer cycle
the rubber_pad of stop_bar 90 frictionally engages the underside of the sheet passing over the gap between the two conveyors
movement of the sheet is thereby stopped and at substantially the same_time conveyor 13 shifts to high speed mode and conveyor 12 shifts to low speed mode
at high speed belt 13 quickly transfers onto the stack those sheets downstream of the raised interrupter bar 90
in the meantime the belt of conveyor 12 moving at low speed continues to receive sheets from the corrugator and advance them at about one-half normal speed toward the bar 90
in this way an excessive pile up of sheets behind the stop_bar is avoided
u.s._patent_no._4040,618 col._9,_ll._19-35 emphasis added
in other words when the last_sheet of the preceding group passes the interrupt_mechanism the vermes interrupt_mechanism engages and at substantially the same_time the vermes downstream conveyor accelerates and the upstream_conveyor slows

this description of the prior_art vermes technology describes with precision the operation of the fosber accused device as well
when the processing circuitry of the fosber_device determines *1368 that the preceding group of sheets has completely passed through the shingling nip the bar and rubber_pad of the interrupt_mechanism engage to prevent the succeeding group of sheets from feeding onto the next conveyor
at substantially the same_time fosbers downstream conveyor accelerates and the upstream_conveyor slows
significantly in the fosber_device as in vermes the upstream_conveyor slows in response to the interrupt engaging not in response to passage of the trailing end as the asserted claims recite
see marquip_ii at *4
in terms of the helpful wilson_sporting_goods analysis the vermes prior_art would have precluded patentability of a hypothetical_claim encompassing all elements of the fosber accused device

accordingly it would be improper to interpret element c of the claims to cover the fosber_device by equivalence because to do so would render the asserted claims unpatentable over the prior_art
see wilson_sporting_goods 904 f.2d at 684
indeed the reexamination prosecution history of the276_patent shows as well that the fosber_device does not infringe by equivalents element c of claims 9_and_13
during reexamination of the276_patent the examiner considered prior_art not previously before the pto including vermes
upon review the examiner found that` [ c ] laims 9_and_13 define over the prior_art by the limitations at claim 9 c and claim 13 c relating to the slowing in response to the trailing end of the group'
j.a.at 429 emphasis added
in effect` [ t ] he essence and elegance of the276_patent is its exclusive use of changing conveyor_speeds to create the gap necessary to buy time to unload the stacker'
marquip_iii at 10 emphasis added

marquips arguments focusing on the differences in sheet counting between vermes and the276_patent is only marginally if at all relevant
rather the determinative factor in the infringement analysis turns on whether the slowing of the conveyors is in response to the passage of the trailing end as the claims recite or in response to the interrupt_mechanism as vermes teaches and as the fosber_device operates
marquip does not show any genuine disputes of material_fact to satisfy its burden` to prove that the range of equivalents which it seeks would not ensnare the prior_art'
wilson_sporting_goods 904 f.2d at 685` the patent owner has always borne the burden of proving infringement'
( internal citations omitted

thus the district_court properly held as a matter of law that the fosber_device and method does not infringe under the doctrine of equivalents because it uses technology-an interrupt_mechanism and changing conveyor_speeds-already in the prior_art
see sage prods. inc. v. devon indus. inc. 126_f.3d_1420 1423 44_uspq2d_1103 1106 fed.cir.1997` although equivalence is a factual matter normally reserved for a fact-finder the trial court should grant summary_judgment in any case where no reasonable fact-finder could find equivalence`
accordingly this court affirms the district_courts grant of fosbers motion for summary_judgment of non-infringement under the doctrine of equivalents

iii
on october 13 1998 within a month of the district_courts decision on remand in marquip_iii but more than one year after the initial decision in marquip_i marquip filed a rule 60 b motion seeking relief from the final_judgment of marquip_iii in light of newly discovered evidence
marquip alleged that fosber withheld evidence about its device pertinent to infringement
therefore marquip sought relief under rule 60 b 1 2 3 and 6 which states in pertinent part [ t ] he court may relieve a party or a partys legal representative from a final_judgment order or proceeding for the following reasons 1 mistake inadvertence surprise or excusable neglect ; *1369 2 newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under rule 59 b ; 3 fraud.. misrepresentation or other misconduct of an adverse party ;.. or
( 6 any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment
the motion shall be made within a reasonable_time and for reasons 1 2 and 3 not more than one year after the judgment order or proceeding was entered or taken
fed.r.civ.p
60 b
in marquip_iv the district_court denied the rule 60 b motion under subsections 1 2 and 3 as untimely because the motion was filed more than one year after the initial ruling in marquip_i
the district_court also denied relief under subsection 6

to review a purely procedural question not pertaining to patent law such as a rule 60 b motion this court applies the rule of the regional_circuit in this case the united_states_court of appeals for the seventh_circuit
see amstar_corp. v. envirotech corp. 823_f.2d_1538 1550 3_uspq2d_1412 1421 fed.cir.1987` because denial of a rule 60 b motion is a procedural issue not unique to patent law we apply the rule of the regional_circuit where appeals from the district_court would normally lie
`` ; see also midwest industries inc. v. karavan trailers inc. 175_f.3d_1356 1359 50_uspq2d_1672 1675 fed.cir.1999 en banc in relevant part
the seventh_circuit and therefore this court uses an abuse of discretion standard to assess the merits of rule 60 b questions
see money store inc. v. harriscorp finance inc. 885_f.2d_369 372 7th_cir
1994

upon review this court detects no abuse of the district_courts broad discretion to apply rule 60 b
as to the denial of relief under subsections 1 2 and 3 the key issue is whether the one-year limitation is measured from the entry of final_judgment in the initial_trial or the remanded trial
the district_court concluded that` a review of the [ rule 60 b ] motion and the nature of the previous judgments leads to the inescapable conclusion that [ marquip ] is actually seeking relief from the final_judgment of june_11,_1997 entered outside the jurisdictional limit'
marquip_iv at 6

without cases directly on point in the seventh_circuit the district_court considered cases of other circuits addressing the effect of a remand on the timing of a rule 60 b motion
in this case the parties completed discovery before entry of the 1997 judgment in marquip_i
also marquip recognizes that the newly discovered facts are critical to both marquip_i and its affirmance in marquip_iii
thus the district_court committed no reversible error in determining that the initial judgment in marquip_i is the appropriate measuring date for a rule 60 b challenge
marquip could have made a rule 60 b motion on the same basis against the original_judgment
see amstar_corp. 823 f.2d at 1550 rejecting a rule 60 b motion as untimely because the motion related to issues of an earlier judgment before remand ; see regional properties inc. v. financial & real estate consulting co. 752_f.2d_178 184 5th cir
1985 holding that` [ t ] he date of the original_judgment is the proper date of reference for consideration of [ the rule ] 60 b motion' ; moolenaar v. government of virgin islands 822_f.2d_1342 1348 3rd cir
1987` although the motion was brought only six weeks after the district_courts judgment on remand the reason for the attack upon that judgment was available for attack upon the original_judgment.. [ thus the rule 60 b ] motion wasnot made within a reasonable_time
``

therefore marquip can not` resurrect its literal infringement claims and expand them to claims not pursued prior to the 1997 judgment'
marquip_iv at 9
in light of the policy promoting the finality of judgments this court finds no discernible abuse of discretion by the district_court in *1370 denying the rule 60 b motion under subsections 1 2 and 3

the district_court also did not abuse its discretion in denying relief under subsection 6
marquip sought relief under this` catch-all' subsection without a time limitation
relief under rule 60 b 6 however is available only when the basis for relief does not fall within any of the categories specifically enumerated in rule 60 b and when the circumstances are extraordinary
see wesco prods co. v. alloy automotive co. 880_f.2d_981 983 7th_cir
1989` [ i ] f the asserted grounds for relief fall within the terms of the first three clauses of rule 60 b relief under the catchall provision is not available
`` ; pioneer_inv servs co. v. brunswick assoc
`` ; pioneer_inv ltd. partnership 507_u.s._380 393 113_s.ct._1489 123_l.ed.2d_74_(1993)` to justify relief under subsection 6 a party must showextraordinary_circumstances suggesting that the party is faultless in delay
``

here marquip satisfies neither requirement
first the basis for marquips motion could have fallen under rule 60 b 2 as newly discovered evidence or rule 60 b 3 as misrepresentation or misconduct by fosber
second although fosber may have` engaged in gamesmanship by strategically limiting disclosures based on an unreasonably narrow interpretation of [ marquips ] discovery_requests' the district_court found no evidence of` false responses to discovery_requests'
marquip_iv at 11
based on this record this court finds that the district_court did not abuse its discretion
fosbers behavior does not rise to the level of` extraordinary_circumstances' necessary to invoke subsection 6

conclusion
because the fosber_device falls within the prior_art this court affirms the district_courts grant of fosbers motion for summary_judgment of non-infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
additionally this court also affirms the district_courts denial of marquips motion under rule 60 b
