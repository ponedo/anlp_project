patentee brought action against competitor alleging competitor infringed patents on process for making solid formulation of enalapril_sodium for use in treatment of high_blood_pressure
the united_states_district_court for the northern_district of illinois 2000_wl_97582 matthew f. kennelly j. granted competitors motion for summary_judgment on grounds patents were invalid and patentee appealed
the court of appeals lourie circuit_judge held that 1 statute under which patent was invalid if invention was previously made` in this country by another inventor who had not abandoned suppressed or concealed it' did not limit proof negating suppression or concealment to activities occurring within the united_states ; 2 competitor in asserting invalidity of patent on ground of prior_invention had to rebut any alleged_suppression or concealment with clear and convincing_evidence to the contrary ; 3 patentee successfully discharged its burden of going forward with evidence creating a genuine_issue of material_fact of suppression or concealment ; but 4 competitor the first_inventor of the process for manufacturing its own patented product succeeded in rebutting by clear and convincing_evidence inference of suppression or concealment created by its five-year period of inactivity in disclosing invention and thus established invalidity of patents at issue based on its prior_invention

opinion
lourie circuit_judge
apotex_usa inc. appeals from the decision of the united_states_district_court for the northern_district of illinois granting merck & co. inc.s motion for summary_judgment that the claims of u.s
patents 5,573 780_and_5690,962 are invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 g

because the district_court did not err in granting summary_judgment that the ¡¬780 and ¡¬ 962 patents are invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 g we affirm

background
apotex is the assignee of the ¡¬780 and ¡¬962_patent s which relate to a process for making a stable solid formulation of enalapril_sodium for use in the treatment of high_blood_pressure
apotex i at *1
claim 1 of the ¡¬ 780 patent which is representative of the claims at issue reads as follows 1
a process of manufacture of a pharmaceutical solid composition comprising enalapril_sodium which process comprises the steps of i a mixing enalapril_maleate with an alkaline_sodium_compound and at least one other excipient adding water sufficient to moisten and mixing to achieve a wet_mass or
b mixing enalapril_maleate with at least one excipient other than an alkaline_sodium_compound adding a solution of an alkaline_sodium_compound in water sufficient to moisten and mixing to achieve a wet_mass ; thereby to achieve a reaction without converting the enalapril_maleate to a clear solution of enalapril_sodium and maleic acid sodium salt in water ii drying the wet_mass and
*1034 iii further processing the dried material into tablets
'780_patent col._5,_l._34 to col._6,_l._15
the claims of the ¡¬962_patent which is a continuation of the application that led to the ¡¬780_patent are identical to those found in the ¡¬780_patent except that they are not restricted to tablet form but rather encompass any solid pharmaceutical dosage form of enalapril_sodium
¡¬962_patent col._5,_l._22 to col._6,_l._11
this distinction is not material to the resolution of this appeal

merck manufactures enalapril_sodium under the trade name vasotecthe_r and has been continuously manufacturing and commercially selling vasotecthe_r_tablets since 1983
apotex i at *7
merck owns both u.s. and canadian patents covering the enalapril_sodium_compound but does not own a patent covering its process of manufacturing_vasotecthe_r
id.at *1
however in 1992 merck disclosed the ingredients utilized in its vasotecthe_r manufacturing process in a canadian_product_monograph and more than 30,000 copies of the monograph were distributed in 1993 alone
id.at *7
merck also disclosed the ingredients used in manufacturing renitecthe_r the trademark used for its enalapril_sodium product sold in various foreign countries in the 1988 edition of the dictionnaire_vidal a french pharmaceutical dictionary
id

in 1991 merck and its canadian subsidiary merck frosst canada inc. sued apotexs canadian affiliate apotex canada for infringement of mercks canadian patent covering the enalapril_sodium_compound
id.at *1
during the 1994 trial` the canadian_trial' brian_mcleod mercks then-vice president of marketing performed a step-by-step narration of a videotape demonstrating mercks process of manufacturing_vasotecthe_r
id
within days of hearing this testimony dr. bernard sherman an apotex official allegedly conceived the patented_process at issue
id

apotex filed the present action against merck alleging that mercks process of manufacturing_vasotecthe_r infringes all of the claims of both the ¡¬ 780 and ¡¬962_patent s. id
both parties filed cross-motions for summary_judgment on the issue of infringement and merck cross-moved for summary_judgment of invalidity under ¡± 102 g
id
the district_court granted apotexs motion for summary_judgment of infringement but also granted mercks cross-motion for summary_judgment of invalidity because it found that merck invented the process claimed in the ¡¬780 and ¡¬962_patent s within the united_states before apotex and did not abandon suppress or conceal that invention within the meaning of ¡± 102 g
id.at *9

apotex thereafter filed a motion asking the court to reconsider its grant of summary_judgment of invalidity which the district_court denied

. 149_f.3d_1309 1315 47_uspq2d_1272 1275 fed.cir.1998

apotex argues that the district_court improperly invalidated the ¡¬780 and ¡¬ 962 patents because merck failed to prove by clear and convincing_evidence that it did not suppress or conceal the patented_process
apotex contends that proof of invalidity under ¡± 102 g requires merck to prove that it did not suppress or conceal the process of manufacturing_vasotecthe_r_tablets based on its activities within the united_states and that mercks foreign_disclosures therefore can not be used to satisfy its burden of proof
apotex also contends that in any event mercks foreign_disclosures fail to prove that it did not suppress or conceal the process because nothing in the testimony from the canadian_trial the product_monograph or the french_dictionary disclosed the use of water the occurrence of an acid-base_chemical_reaction between enalapril_maleate and sodium_bicarbonate or the resultant enalapril_sodium product
finally apotex argues that the evidence demonstrates that merck in fact suppressed or concealed its invention by failing to file a patent_application on the process by submitting misleading information in its new drug application` nda' that only disclosed the starting ingredients used to make vasotecthe_r and by preventing the details of its process from circulating outside of the company

merck responds that ¡± 102 g only requires proof that the prior_invention was made in the united_states and that evidence of lack of suppression or concealment can be proven by both foreign and domestic activities
merck further argues that it did not suppress or conceal the process because it used it commercially disclosed it in open court directly to its competitor and published the ingredients used to make vasotecthe_r_tablets in both the product_monograph and the french_dictionary
merck also argues that the submissions it made with respect to its nda were proper and in any event could not constitute suppression or concealment because it was the food and drug administration that never made those submissions public
finally merck contends that the process was not suppressed or concealed because it was obvious and dr._sherman admitted that vasotecthe_r_tablets could be reverse-engineered to reveal the details of the process

section 102 g operates to ensure that a patent is awarded only to the` first' inventor in law
in addition to governing priority_determinations in interference_proceedings in the united_states patent and trademark office ¡± 102 g may be asserted as a basis for invalidating a patent in defense to an infringement_suit
new idea farm equip corp. v. sperry corp. 916_f.2d_1561 1566 16_uspq2d_1424 1428 fed.cir.1990 citation omitted
that section provides in relevant part that` a person shall be entitled to a patent unless.. before such persons invention thereof the invention was made in this country by another inventor who had not abandoned suppressed or concealed it'
35 u.s.c.a.¡± 102 g west supp.2000
therefore if a patentees invention has been made by another prior_inventor who has not abandoned suppressed or concealed the invention ¡± 102 g will invalidate that patent
new idea 916 f.2d at 1566 16 uspq2d at 1428

apotex does not dispute that merck invented the patented_process in the united_states well before dr._shermans alleged date of conception
apotex also concedes that merck did not abandon *1036 its process of manufacturing_vasotecthe_r_tablets as shown by its continuous commercial use of the process since 1983
the sole issue on appeal therefore is whether merck` suppressed' or` concealed' the process within the meaning of ¡± 102 g
whether suppression or concealment has occurred is a question of law which we review de novo
brokaw v. vogel 57_c.c.p.a._1296 429_f.2d_476 480 166_uspq_428 431 ccpa 1970

as an initial matter we disagree with apotexs interpretation of ¡± 102 g as requiring proof negating suppression or concealment to arise from activities occurring within the united_states
the plain_language of ¡± 102 g clearly requires that the prior_invention be made` in this country'
however in light of the grammatical structure of ¡± 102 g it would be a strained reading of that provision to interpret the language` in this country' to also modify the requirement that the prior_invention was` not.. abandoned suppressed or concealed'
a more reasonable interpretation is that it only modifies the antecedent verb` made' but not the` abandoned suppressed or concealed' clause that follows it
had congress intended the phrase` in this country' to modify` abandoned suppressed or concealed' it would have inserted language to that effect

indeed if there were any doubt the legislative history of ¡± 102 g demonstrates that congress contemplated that precise modification as it applied to another clause in ¡± 102 g and failed to adopt it
an earlier version of that provision considered in the house read as follows [ b ] efore the applicants invention thereof the invention was in fact made in this country by another who had not abandoned it and who was using reasonable_diligence in this country in reducing it to practice or had reduced it to practice
h.r
3760 82nd cong
( 1951 emphasis added
the fact that the drafters found it desirable to emphasize that the language` in this country' applies to` using reasonable_diligence' as well as to the word` made' supports the conclusion that it only modifies the verb that precedes it and not any subordinate clause that follows it
accordingly based upon the plain_language of ¡± 102 g and the relevant legislative history of that provision we conclude that the language` in this country' only applies to the country where` the invention was made' and that proof negating suppression or concealment is not limited to activities occurring within the united_states

we next turn to an issue that has not been squarely addressed by this court in considering suppression or concealment as negating prior_invention in a defense to an infringement_suit under ¡± 102 g -the burdens of proof governing such a determination
section 282 of the patent act provides that` [ a ] patent shall be presumed valid'
35 u.s.c.a.¡± 282 west supp.2000
in order to overcome the presumption of validity the party challenging a patent must prove facts supporting a determination of invalidity by clear and convincing_evidence
am
hoist & derrick co. v. sowa & sons inc. 725_f.2d_1350 1360 220_uspq_763 770 fed.cir.1984
section 282 applies with full force to a ¡± 102 g defense and thus a party asserting invalidity under ¡± 102 g must prove facts by clear and convincing_evidence establishing a prior_invention that was not abandoned suppressed or concealed
see kimberly-clark_corp. v. procter & gamble distrib co. 973_f.2d_911 915 23_uspq2d_1921 1924 fed.cir.1992

in young v. dworkin one of our predecessor courts set forth the relevant burdens of proof governing a determination whether a prior_invention was suppressed *1037 or concealed in the context of an interference between co-pending applications as follows the sole remaining question is whether the board correctly held that junior_party-appellant suppressed or concealed his invention within the meaning of 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 g
here the senior party-appellee bears the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence notwithstanding junior_party-appellants burden on the issue of priority of invention which he has sustained
young v. dworkin 489_f.2d_1277 1279 180_uspq_388 390 ccpa 1974 citing gallagher v. smith 41_c.c.p.a._734 206_f.2d_939 99_uspq_132_(ccpa_1953)
thus under ¡± 102 g interference_law involving co-pending applications once the first_party to invent has established priority of invention the second party to conceive and reduce the invention to practice has the burden of proving that the first_party suppressed or concealed the invention
in such an interference the first_party to invent does not bear any burden of proof regarding suppression or concealment once it has established an earlier date of invention

a ¡± 102 g prior_invention defense is governed by the identical` suppressed or concealed' language applicable to priority_determinations in interference_proceedings
35 u.s.c.¡± 102 g
we must therefore interpret the ¡± 102 g defense provision consistently with established interference_law
however infringement actions implicating a ¡± 102 g defense differ from interferences in that a patent has been granted on the invention at issue and therefore the presumption of validity under ¡± 282 applies.1 because the patentee analogous to the second-to-invent in the interference_context has the benefit of the presumption of validity that party should only be held to bear a burden of producing evidence indicating that the prior_inventor may have suppressed or concealed the invention once the challenger analogous to the first-to-invent in the interference_context has established prior_invention by clear and convincing_evidence
that burden bears a rough similarity to placing the burden of proving suppression or concealment on the second-to-invent under interference_law but at the same time is appropriately limited to one of production not persuasion giving due regard to the presumption of validity

we therefore interpret ¡± 102 g as requiring that once a challenger of a patent has proven by clear and convincing_evidence that` the invention was made in this country by another inventor' 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 g the burden of production shifts to the patentee to produce evidence sufficient to create a genuine_issue of material_fact as to whether the prior_inventor has suppressed or concealed the invention
however in accordance with the statutory presumption in 35 u.s.c.¡± 282 the ultimate *1038 burden of persuasion remains with the party challenging the validity of the patent
see innovative scuba concepts inc. v. feder indus. inc. 26_f.3d_1112 1115 31_uspq2d_1132 1134 fed.cir.1994` while a patentee may have the burden of going forward with rebuttal evidence once a challenger presented a prima facie case of invalidity the presumption of validity remains intact and the ultimate burden of proving invalidity remains with the challenger throughout the litigation'
( citing hybritech inc. v. monoclonal antibodies inc. 802_f.2d_1367 1376 231_uspq_81 87 fed.cir.1986
once the patentee has satisfied its burden of production the party alleging invalidity under ¡± 102 g must rebut any alleged_suppression or concealment with clear and convincing_evidence to the contrary

our case law distinguishes between two types of suppression or concealment
the first is implicated in a situation in which an inventor actively suppresses or conceals his invention from the public
fujikawa v. wattanasin 93_f.3d_1559 1567 39_uspq2d_1895 1901 fed.cir.1996 citing kendall v. winsor 62 u.s. 21 how
322 328 16_l.ed._165_(1858)
the second involves a legal inference of suppression or concealment based upon an unreasonable delay in filing a patent_application.2 peeler v. miller 535_f.2d_647 655 190_uspq_117 122 1976 holding that a four-year_delay in filing a patent_application after the invention was perfected was unreasonably long ; shindelar v. holdeman 628_f.2d_1337 1342 207_uspq_112 116 1980 finding suppression or concealment because no reasonable explanation was given for the two-year and five-month delay between reduction to practice and the filing of a patent_application
the latter type is involved here

although a prior_inventor implicated in a ¡± 102 g infringement defense may not have filed a patent_application in contrast to an interference contestant that partys delay in otherwise bringing the knowledge of the invention to the public may nevertheless raise a similar inference of suppression or concealment
see int l glass co. v. united_states 408_f.2d_395 403 ct.cl.1969 holding that the prior_invention of a process did not invalidate a patent on the same process under ¡± 102 g because the prior_inventor did nothing to make the invention known to the public
even though there is no explicit disclosure requirement in ¡± 102 g the spirit and policy of the patent laws encourage an inventor to take steps to ensure that` the public has gained knowledge of the invention which will insure its preservation in the public domain' or else run the risk of being dominated by the patent of another
palmer v. dudzik 481_f.2d_1377 1387 178_uspq_608 616 ccpa 1973 ; see also kimberly-clark_corp. v. johnson & johnson 745_f.2d_1437 1446 1453 223_uspq_603 607 614 fed.cir.1984 defining ¡± 102` prior_art' to be` technology already available to the public' and stating that` secret_prior_art' may not be used to invalidate a patent under ¡± 102 g ; oddzon prods. inc. v. just toys inc. 122_f.3d_1396 1402 43_uspq2d_1641 1645 fed.cir.1997` [ w ] hen the possessor of secret_prior_art art that has been abandoned suppressed or concealed that predates the critical date is faced with a later-filed patent the later-filed patent should not be invalidated in the face of thisprior *1039 art which has not been made available to the public
thus prior but non-public inventors yield to later inventors who utilize the patent system`
absent a satisfactory explanation for the delay or the presence of other mitigating facts a prior_invention will therefore be deemed suppressed or concealed within the meaning of ¡± 102 g` if within a reasonable time after completion no steps are taken to make the invention publicly known'
int l glass 408 f.2d at 403

in the case at hand we find that apotex has satisfied its burden of producing evidence sufficient to create a genuine_issue of material_fact that merck suppressed or concealed its process of manufacturing enalapril_sodium tablets
we emphasize at the outset that although ¡± 102 g prior_art must be somehow made available to the public in order to defeat another patent a ¡± 102 g prior_inventor is under no obligation to file a patent_application
checkpoint sys. inc. v. united_states int l trade comm n 54_f.3d_756 763 35_uspq2d_1042 1048 fed.cir.1995
thus while mercks failure to file a patent_application may be relevant to a determination whether it suppressed or concealed its process especially if there were evidence that such failure was based on a decision to retain the invention as a trade secret that failure alone does not satisfy the patentees burden of producing evidence sufficient to create a genuine_issue of material_fact of suppression or concealment
see e.i
du pont de nemours & co. v. phillips petroleum co. 849_f.2d_1430 1437 7_uspq2d_1129 1135 fed.cir.1988 explaining that a patent_application need not be filed on an invention for it to be considered ¡± 102 g prior_art as long as the invention is found not to have been abandoned suppressed or concealed

however apotex did allege that merck failed to make its invention publicly known
merck perfected its process and began commercially using the process to manufacture vasotecthe_r_tablets no later than 1983
although merck argues that its process was disclosed to the public because its vasotecthe_r_tablets could have been reverse-engineered that argument is based on the admissions of dr._sherman who drew upon the information provided in mercks subsequent disclosures to determine the details of the process.3 thus it appears that merck took no steps to make the invention publicly known for nearly five years when it first published the ingredients used in its process in the 1988 edition of the dictionnaire_vidal
we find that such a delay raises an inference that merck suppressed or concealed its invention
accordingly because apotex has successfully discharged its burden of going forward with evidence creating a genuine_issue of material_fact of suppression or concealment the burden shifts to merck to rebut that showing by clear and convincing_evidence to the contrary

we conclude that merck has succeeded in rebutting the inference of suppression or concealment created by its period of inactivity by clear and convincing_evidence
in paulik v. rizkalla we stated the rule that` the first_inventor will not be barred from relying on later resumed activity antedating an opponents entry into *1040 the field merely because the work done before the delay was sufficient to amount to a reduction to practice'
760_f.2d_1270 1275 226_uspq_224 228 fed.cir.1985 holding that the inference of suppression or concealment from a four-year_delay between reduction to practice and the filing of a patent_application was overcome by the first_inventors resumption of activity before the second inventors date of conception
thus even though merck may have suppressed or concealed the process for a period of time after it reduced it to practice in 1983 as long as it` resumed activity' i.e. made the benefits of its invention known to the public before apotexs entry into the field it can not be deemed to have suppressed or concealed the invention within the meaning of ¡± 102 g

merck made several disclosures following its period of suppression or concealment that made the invention publicly known all of which took place before apotexs entry into the field here dr._shermans alleged conception in april of 1994
first merck disclosed the ingredients used in manufacturing_vasotecthe_r_tablets in the 1988 edition of the dictionnaire_vidal
it also widely distributed the product_monograph in canada from october 1992_through_1994 which similarly disclosed the ingredients it used in its manufacturing process
merck also provided a step-by-step description of the process through the testimony given by brian_mcleod at the canadian_trial on march_28,_1994

apotex argues that these disclosures inadequately described mercks process of manufacturing_vasotecthe_r_tablets and therefore that the public never received the benefit of the invention
however dr._sherman admitted both in his deposition in this case and in his 1994 statement of facts prepared for the canadian_trial that his inspection of the vasotecthe_r_tablets that merck sold commercially revealed that they were made using a wet granulation process
he also admitted that after learning of the disclosed starting ingredients from the canadian_product_monograph which included sodium_bicarbonate it` immediately occurred' to him and was` obvious to any knowledgeable formulator or chemist' that the final enalapril_sodium product in the vasotecthe_r_tablets was the result of an acid-base_chemical_reaction between enalapril_maleate and sodium_bicarbonate in water
mercks various disclosures in conjunction with apotexs admissions therefore clearly and convincingly prove that merck made the knowledge of its invention available to the public thereby satisfying its burden of rebutting apotexs evidence of suppression or concealment

moreover apotexs argument that merck suppressed or concealed the process by submitting misleading information to the fda in 1983 is irrelevant because any suppression that was implicated was overcome by mercks subsequent activity
we therefore conclude that the district_court did not err in granting summary_judgment that the ¡¬780 and ¡¬962_patent s are invalid under ¡± 102 g

we have considered apotexs remaining arguments and find them to be unpersuasive

conclusion
because the district_court did not err in granting summary_judgment that the ¡¬ 780 and ¡¬962_patent s are invalid under 35 u.sc.¡± 102 g we

affirm

generally speaking the presumption of validity does not apply to patents involved in interference_proceedings and thus the invalidity of a patent involved in an interference under ¡± 102 g need only be proven by preponderant evidence
see bruning v. hirose 161_f.3d_681 686 48_uspq2d_1934 1938 fed.cir.1998 holding that in an interference involving a patent issued from an application that was co-pending with the interfering application the appropriate standard of proof for validity challenges is the preponderance of the evidence standard because the presumption of validity is inapplicable
however the presumption may effectively be implicated in the case of a priority contest between an issued patent and an application that was filed after the issuance of the patent
in such a situation the junior_party must establish priority of invention by clear and convincing_evidence
price v. symsek 988_f.2d_1187 1194 26_uspq2d_1031 1036 fed.cir.1993
such a factual scenario is not before us
2
a subset of the category of` inferred' suppression or concealment arises in a situation in which the first_inventor is` spurred' into filing a patent_application by another application mason v. hepburn 13_app.d.c._86_(d.c.cir.1898) or by the commercial activity of another woofter v. carlson 54_c.c.p.a._917 367_f.2d_436 445-446 151_uspq_407 416 ccpa 1967
this case does not involve` spurring'
3
it is worth noting that if it were clear that mercks process could be reverse-engineered by one of ordinary skill through an inspection of vasotecthe_r_tablets apotex could not benefit from the inference of suppression or concealment because merck could not be said to have delayed in making the benefits of its invention known to the public
see palmer 481 f.2d at 1386-87 178 uspq at 615 stating that a commercial use of an invention will preclude a finding of suppression or concealment only when such use enables the public to learn of the invention
