boston_scientific_corp. v. johnson & johnson inc. 679_f.supp.2d_539 d.del.2010
the district_court determined that the asserted claims of the ¡¬7286_patent the ¡¬3286_patent and the ¡¬473_patent collectively the 1997 patents are invalid for lack of adequate written description and lack of enablement and that the asserted claims of the ¡¬662_patent are invalid for lack of adequate written description
because no finder of fact could reasonably determine that the asserted claims of the patents-in-suit contained an adequate written description we affirm

background
i. drug-eluting stents
the patents-in-suit relate to drug-eluting coronary_stents used in the treatment of coronary_artery_disease
coronary artery disease is caused in part by atherosclerosis a build-up of arterial plaque
atherosclerosis limits the flow of blood and oxygen to the heart and can result in chest pain blood clots heart attacks and other ailments

in 1977 physicians first used a procedure called balloon_angioplasty to reopen arteries closing because of atherosclerosis
during the procedure the physician inserts a balloon catheter into an artery near the patients groin and threads the catheter through the artery to the site of the blockage
the physician then inflates the balloon to reopen the narrowed artery
in many balloon_angioplasty patients the opened artery narrows again-a process known as restenosis
one of the key components of restenosis is a phenomenon called neointimal_proliferation wherein the smooth muscle cells of the artery multiply over time in response to injury caused by the inflation of the balloon
the result of neointimal_proliferation is the renarrowing of the artery

in the 1980s physicians began using bare_metal_coronary_stents to support the artery after the physician deflates the balloon
although these bare_metal_coronary_stents prevented the collapse of the artery and constriction due to scarring restenosis remained a problem because the bare metal stents did not prevent neointimal_proliferation

researchers turned to a myriad of techniques in an attempt to prevent restenosis following balloon_angioplasty
for example *1357 researchers tested numerous oral drugs for the treatment of restenosis
j.a
14732-39
one of appellants experts characterized the number and variety of drugs tested as` reflect [ ing ] the lack of any clear path or direction toward a particular drug therapy for restenosis'
j.a
14732
researchers also experimented with drug-eluting_stents in an effort to prevent restenosis
researchers believed that the drugs contained on such stents could help prevent neointimal_proliferation
cordiss cypherthe_r_stent was the first_drug-eluting_stent approved by the united_states food and drug administration fda and sold in the united_states

ii
the patents-in-suit
the 1997 patents claim drug-eluting_stents using either rapamycin or a macrocyclic_lactone_analog of rapamycin as the therapeutic_agent
the ¡¬ 662 patent claims drug-eluting_stents using either rapamycin or a macrocyclic_triene_analog of rapamycin.1 the rapamycin_molecule has a number of structural_features including lactone and triene moieties
thus rapamycin is both a macrocyclic_triene and a macrocyclic_lactone
rapamycin is depicted below with the macrocyclic ring the lactone group and the triene_group identified

?
appellees br

cordiss cypherthe_r drug-eluting_stent utilizes rapamycin as a therapeutic ingredient
rapamycin also called sirolimus is a naturally occurring compound produced by the bacterium streptomyces hygroscopicus
scientists at ayerst research laboratories which later became part of wyeth isolated rapamycin and the compound was first publicly described in articles published in 1975

researchers first investigated rapamycin as a potential antifungal
later researchers discovered that rapamycin exhibited other properties including anti-tumor activity and immunosuppressant activity
in the early 1990s researchers at stanford university discovered that rapamycin inhibited restenosis after oral administration to rats

prior to the filing of the 1997 patents some analogs of rapamycin were disclosed in the prior_art
for example pct application *big_token__1358_wo_94__big_token /09010 the cottens_publication describes` novel alkylated derivatives of rapamycin having pharmaceutical utility especially as immunosuppressants'
j.a
11059-11100
the cottens_publication specifically describes twenty-eight` preferred novel_compounds' twenty-five of which contain the same macrocyclic ring as rapamycin
j.a
11063-64
these preferred analogs include everolimus
everolimus is made by modifying rapamycin at a single location and is both a macrocyclic_lactone and triene_analog of rapamycin
boston_scientific_corp. 679 f.supp.2d at 543_n._3
similarly u.s. patent no._5362,718 the skotnicki_patent claims and describes macrocyclic analogs of rapamycin and provides examples of fourteen specific structures
j.a
10595-608

a
the 1997 patents
the ¡¬7286_patent the ¡¬3286_patent and the ¡¬473_patent all descend from a provisional application filed in april 1997
the 1997 patents share a common specification and generally claim drug-eluting_stents utilizing` rapamycin or a macrocyclic_lactone_analog thereof' as the therapeutic_agent
cordis first added the phrase` macrocyclic_lactone_analog' to the claims during an april_7,_2006 claim amendment during prosecution of the ¡¬3286_patent
j.a
20328-36
cordis added these claims shortly after a competitor guidant received european approval to sell a drug-eluting_stent containing everolimus

the 1997 patents` summary of the invention' describes` [ a ] stent designed to include reservoirs.. [ ] a new approach which offers several important advantages over existing technologies'
¡¬7286_patent col.3 ll.43-45
the` summary of the invention' does not mention any particular therapeutic_agent or any particular polymer coatings
the shared specification discloses that the reservoirs could be loaded with drugs and` [ a ] coating or membrane of biocompatible material could be applied over the reservoirs [ to ] control the diffusion of the drug from the reservoirs to the artery wall'
id
col.3 ll.61-65

later in the` detailed description of illustrative embodiments' the shared specification discusses rapamycin for the first time
the specification identifies rapamycin as one of the` [ n ] umerous agents [ that ] are being actively studied as antiproliferative agents for use in restenosis and [ that ] have shown some activity in experimental animal models'
id
col.5 ll.8-10 33
the 1997 patents indicate that rapamycin is of particular interest because it` is capable of inhibiting both the inflammatory response known to occur after arterial injury and stent implantation as well as the [ smooth muscle cell ] hyperproliferative response'
id
col.5 ll.47-51
however the specification also states that` the precise_mechanism of rapamycin is still under active_investigation' id
col.5_ll.36-38 and that` the ideal_agent for restenosis has not yet been identified' id
col.5 ll.59-60

the specification of the 1997 patents contains only a single reference to the claimed macrocyclic_lactones
under a subheading` experiments' the specification states` agents rapamycin sirolimus structural_analogs macrocyclic_lactones and inhibitors of cell-cycle_progression'
id
col.6 ll.4-5
the experiments disclosed under this subheading however only use rapamycin
the specification does not include any experiments using a macrocyclic_lactone_analog or even provide a single example of a macrocyclic_lactone_analog

b
the ¡¬662_patent
cordis filed the application that issued as the ¡¬662_patent in 2004 but asserts that the claims are entitled to an effective filing *1359 date of january 25 2001
the ¡¬662_patent defines rapamycin broadly to include` rapamycin rapamycin_analogs derivatives and congeners that bind fkbp12 and possess the same pharmacologic properties as rapamycin'
see e.g. ¡¬662_patent col.5 ll.48-51
the ¡¬662_patent like the 1997 patents does not identify any specific_species of rapamycin_analogs

furthermore the ¡¬662_patent does not identify what constitutes the claimed` macrocyclic_triene_analogs' of rapamycin and provides no examples of` macrocyclic_triene_analogs'
in fact the only time the term` macrocyclic_triene' is used in the specification is the brief statement that` [ r ] apamycin is a macroyclic [ sic ] triene antibiotic'
id
col.5 l.31
unlike the 1997 patents where the shared specification mentions the genus macrocyclic_lactone_analogs of rapamycin and claims it in combination with other_elements here the inventors disclosed a genus analogs of rapamycin but claimed a narrower_sub-genus of analogs macrocyclic_triene_analogs of rapamycin in combination with other_elements
all of the data in the ¡¬662_patent relate to studies done with rapamycin coated stents-there is no data on stents using any rapamycin_analog
as with the 1997 patents cordis added claim_language specifying` macrocyclic_triene_analogs' only after guidant received approval for an everolimus coated stent

district court proceedings
appellees boston_scientific corporation and boston_scientific_scimed inc. collectively bsc filed four complaints later consolidated against j & j and cordis seeking declaratory judgments that the claims of the four patents-in-suit are invalid
boston_scientific_corp. 679 f.supp.2d at 542
bsc sells the accused promusthe_r everolimus-eluting coronary_stent_system the promus_stent which uses everolimus to prevent restenosis following implantation

appellants previously asserted the patents-in-suit against abbott in four civil_actions in the district of new_jersey
id.at 542

in this action the appellants counterclaimed for infringement
id.at 542
wyeth as a co-owner of the ¡¬662_patent with cordis is a party to the action involving the ¡¬662_patent
id.at_n. 1

the parties filed several summary_judgment_motions with the district_court regarding validity and infringement
id.at 542
relevant to this appeal bsc filed a motion for summary_judgment of invalidity of the asserted claims of the 1997 patents and the ¡¬662_patent under 35 u.s.c.¡± 112
id.at 551-52
bsc argued that the asserted claims of the patents-in-suit are invalid for nonenablement lack of adequate written description and indefiniteness.2 id.at 552

a
the 1997 patents
the district_court granted summary_judgment that the 1997 patents are invalid for nonenablement id.at 557 and for failure to meet the written description_requirement id.at 555
addressing written description the district_court determined that the 1997 patents disclose that the claimed analogs must have structural_similarity to rapamycin i.e. they must be macrocyclic_lactones
id.at 554
however the district_court also noted that` this *1360 disclosure in no way restricts the universe of potential_analogs fitting the limitations as construed by the court'
id
in a claim_construction_order issued concurrently with its decision on the summary_judgment_motion the district_court construed the phrase` rapamycin or a macrocyclic_lactone_analog thereof' as meaning` sirolimus or a macrocyclic_lactone_molecule with a structure similar to sirolimus'
markman at *2

the district_court also determined that the specification fails to disclose any formulae or structures of any specific_analog or provide any` definitions examples or experimental_models.. for determining whether a compound is a structurally similar analog as contemplated by the patentees'
boston_scientific_corp. 679 f.supp.2d at 554
the district_court acknowledged that at the time of filing a small_number of macrocyclic_lactone_analogs of rapamycin were known
id
however the district_court without finding a specific quantity noted that there is` a general agreement among the parties that there are numerous potential_analogs of rapamycin'
id.at_n. 23

the district_court recognized that appellants experts opined that the specification discloses that the analogs must have a particular function-the inhibition of cell-cycle_progression-and that a person of ordinary_skill in the art could identify structurally similar analogs with the same function
id.at 555
however the district_court determined that this testimony was insufficient because` describing certain functions of the genus of claimed analogs does not equate to a description of the claimed analogs themselves'
id

the district_court noted that the inventors testified they did not work with or test any analogs of rapamycin prior to filing and` no evidence contradicts the inventors deposition testimony or otherwise indicates that the inventors had possession of the full scope of the invention as claimed'
id
the court concluded that` [ l ] ogically the inventors could not have described a knowledge that they did not possess'
id
the district_court also concluded that` no reasonable_jury could find that the written description_requirement has been met with respect to the claimed analogs'
id
the district_court also held that the 1997 patents are invalid for nonenablement

b
the ¡¬662_patent
the district_court next addressed the ¡¬662_patent
in its claim_construction_order the district_court had construed` macrocyclic_triene_analog' to mean` a macrocyclic_triene molecule with a structure similar to rapamycin and that binds fkbp12'
markman at *2
the district_court determined that the ¡¬662_patent gives more detail as compared to the 1997 patents regarding the mechanism of action of rapamycin
boston_scientific_corp. 679 f.supp.2d at 558_n._37
the district_court found that unlike the 1997 patents` the ¡¬662_patent explains that rapamycin binds fkbp12 which in turn binds to and inhibits the kinase_tor ; this mechanism of action serves to inhibit neointimal_hyperplasia and reduce restenosis'
id.at 557-58

however the district_court further noted that notwithstanding the above disclosure no macrocyclic_triene_analogs are named structurally depicted exemplified or otherwise described in the ¡¬ 662 patent_specification
no assays or other experimental_models are provided with respect to testing an analog candidates ability to function as rapamycin that is to bind fkbp12 which in turn binds to and inhibits the kinase_tor..
thus although limited by function the claims of the ¡¬662_patent are drawn to a *1361 genus of macrocyclic_triene_analogs without any description of any species within the genus
the federal_circuit has required the identification of` sufficient species' to show that the totality of a claimed genus was invented and disclosed
id.at 558 citing carnegie_mellon_univ
v. hoffmann-la_roche_inc. 541_f.3d_1115 1126 fed.cir.2008
the district_court determined that under our precedent` adefinition by function does not suffice to define or describe the genus' even if it allows one of skill to` guess and check' what analogs could potentially work
id.at 558-59 citing enzo_biochem inc. v. gen-probe inc. 323_f.3d_956 968 fed.cir.2002

the district_court acknowledged that` some macrocyclic_triene_analogs were known in the art' but found that this` does not alleviate [ appellants ] obligation under ¡± 112 to provide an example'
id.at 559
the district_court concluded that` [ t ] he inventors were required to describe at least one representative macrocyclic_triene_analog ; having failed to do so the ¡¬662_patent is [ therefore ] invalid for lack of written description'
id
thus the district_court granted bscs motion for summary_judgment of invalidity of the ¡¬662_patent for lack of adequate written description
id
the district_court did not separately rule on whether the ¡¬662_patent is also invalid for lack of enablement
id.at_n. 41
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 13

appellants argue that the district_court improperly granted bscs motion for summary_judgment of invalidity of the ¡¬7286_patent the ¡¬3286_patent the ¡¬473_patent and the ¡¬662_patent under 35 u.s.c.¡± 112

i
the 1997 patents
the parties dispute whether the shared specification of the 1997 patents contains adequate written description regarding the claimed genus of macrocyclic_lactone_analogs of rapamycin
appellants argue that the specifications description of macrocyclic_lactone_analogs was sufficient to satisfy the written description_requirement in light of the state of the art as of the effective_filing_date
appellants contend that they submitted detailed evidence regarding the state of the art that precludes a finding on summary_judgment
for example appellants relied on the declaration of their expert witness dr. david sabatini as well as publications that they allege demonstrate 1 that the structure and the mechanism of action of rapamycin were known ; 2 that the correlation between the structural_elements of rapamycin and its mechanism of action and biological_activity was known ; 3 that dozens of rapamycin_analogs having the same macrocyclic ring structure as rapamycin and comparable biological_activity were known ; and 4 that persons of ordinary_skill knew of assays to determine if analogs had the same mechanism of action as rapamycin and thus would also inhibit cell proliferation
appellants br
43-44

appellants contend that because information regarding the structure mechanism of action and biological_activity of rapamycin and its analogs was set forth in the prior_art it was not necessary for the patent to disclose` formulae or structures' or set forth` definitions examples or experimental_models' of particular macrocyclic_lactone_analogs
instead appellants argue that the specification combined with the knowledge of one skilled in the art` provided a template for those of ordinary_skill to use for identifying analogs falling within the scope of the claims'
appellants br
45-46
appellants relying upon in re herschler 591_f.2d_693 702 ccpa 1979 and in re fuetterer 50_ccpa_1453 319_f.2d_259_(1963)4 argue that when claiming a combination of known elements as opposed to a novel_compound the specification` need not list examples' nor is any` comprehensive description' required
appellants br
32-34
appellants argue that the claimed macrocyclic_lactone_analogs were sufficiently well known such that` the written description need beonly so specific as to lead one having ordinary_skill in the art to that class of compounds
`` id.at 34 quoting herschler

appellants further contend that the prior_art contained a known correlation between the structure of rapamycin and its analogs and their function
appellants argue that because` functional_claim_language can meet the written description_requirement when the art has established a correlation between structure and function' ariad 598 f.3d at 1350 the specification does not need to contain examples of specific macrocyclic_lactone_analogs of rapamycin

bsc contends that the specification of the 1997 patents contains nothing to indicate that the inventors were in possession of the claimed inventions in 1997
bsc *1363 argues that as construed by the district_court the` macrocyclic_lactone_analog' limitation represents a broad_genus that covers any macrocyclic_lactone_molecule that is structurally similar to rapamycin
bsc contends that our precedent sets out a clear test to determine whether a specification adequately describes a claimed chemical_genus a written description of an invention involving a chemical_genus like a description of a chemical_species` requires a precise_definition such as by structure formula [ or ] chemical_name' of the claimed subject_matter sufficient to distinguish it from other_materials
regents of the univ
of cal
v. eli_lilly & co. 119_f.3d_1559 1568 fed.cir.1997 hereinafter eli_lilly

bsc argues that the specification of the 1997 patents fails to meet this test
bsc notes that there are no examples of` macrocyclic_lactone_analogs' of rapamycin in the patents
bsc also argues that the patents fail to disclose the structures or features that render a molecule sufficiently similar to rapamycin to classify it as a` macrocyclic_lactone_analog'
bsc contends that because the specification fails to disclose any of this essential information there is nothing in the 1997 patents showing that the inventors possessed drug-eluting_stents employing the broad_genus of claimed macrocyclic_lactone_analogs
additionally bsc contends that upon consideration of` the existing knowledge in the particular_field the extent and content of the prior_art the maturity of the science or technology [ and ] the predictability of the aspect at issue' ariad 598 f.3d at 1359 the specifications description of macrocyclic_lactone_analogs is insufficient

we agree with bsc that no reasonable_jury could conclude that there is sufficient written description_support for the asserted claims of the 1997 patents
`` a written description of an invention involving a chemical_genus like a description of a chemical_speciesrequires a precise_definition such as by structure formula [ or ] chemical_name of the claimed subject_matter sufficient to distinguish it from other_materials'
eli_lilly 119 f.3d at 1568 quoting fiers v. revel 984_f.2d_1164 1171 fed.cir.1993

we have` held that a sufficient description of a genus requires the disclosure of either a representative number of species falling within the scope of the genus or structural_features common to the members of the genus so that one of skill in the art canvisualize or recognize the members of the genus'
ariad 598 f.3d at 1350
because each individual invention` has a novel relationship with the state of the art from which it emerges' we have declined to` set out any bright-line rules governing for example the number of species that must be disclosed to describe a genus claim..' id.at 1351
the appropriate number of species that one must disclose when claiming a genus` necessarily changes with each invention and it changes with progress in a field'
id

what is required to meet the written description_requirement` varies with the nature and scope of the invention at issue and with the scientific and technologic knowledge already in existence'
capon v. eshhar 418_f.3d_1349 1357 fed.cir.2005
as our en banc court explained in ariad` [ f ] or generic_claims we have set forth a number of factors for evaluating the adequacy of the disclosure includingthe existing knowledge in the particular_field the extent and content of the prior_art the maturity of the science or technology [ and ] the predictability of the aspect at issue
`` ariad 598 f.3d at 1351 citing capon 418 f.3d at 1359

*1364 turning to the specifications disclosure of macrocyclic_lactone_analogs of rapamycin we agree with bsc that no reasonable_jury could conclude that the inventor possessed the claimed subject_matter
the shared specification of the 1997 patents contains virtually no information regarding macrocyclic_lactone_analogs of rapamycin
the sole mention of the analogs outside of the claims that the applicant added nine years after the effective_filing_date is under the heading` experiments'
¡¬7286_patent col.6 ll.4-5
the shared specification lists` agents rapamycin sirolimus structural_analogs macrocyclic_lactones and inhibitors of cell cycle_progression'
id
then four experimental delivery methods using only rapamycin are detailed
no experiments are detailed using macrocyclic_lactone_analogs nor does the specification even indicate performance of any such experiments
an ipsis verbis disclosure of a claimed genus under the heading experiments is not per se sufficient to meet the written description_requirement
enzo_biochem 323 f.3d at 968
while the shared specification demonstrates possession of rapamycin in the claimed stent it does not evidence possession of the genus of macrocyclic_lactone_analogs of rapamycin in the claimed invention to inhibit restenosis

although examples are not always required to satisfy the written description_requirement the lack of any disclosure of examples may be considered when determining whether the claimed invention is adequately described
the 1997 patents contain no examples of macrocyclic_lactone_analogs of rapamycin and give no guidance on how to properly determine whether a compound is a macrocyclic_lactone_analog of rapamycin besides vaguely indicating they must be` structural [ ly ] similar' to rapamycin
given the structural complexity of rapamycin rapamycin contains fifty-one carbon atoms seventy-nine hydrogen atoms thirteen oxygen atoms and a nitrogen atom the universe of potential compounds that are structurally similar to rapamycin and classifiable as macrocyclic_lactones is potentially limitless
as noted by the district_court the appellants do not specifically contest that tens of thousands of potential macrocyclic_lactone_analogs exist
boston_scientific 679 f.supp.2d at 554_n._23
furthermore even the minor structural changes to the molecular structure of rapamycin that are necessary to create analogs may have significant and unpredictable effects on functionality

it is true that some species of this vast genus were known in the art
for example both the cottens_publication and the skotnicki_patent disclosed specific_species of the claimed genus of macrocyclic_lactone_analogs
any suggestion that these references represented existing knowledge in the art so well known as to excuse including a more detailed disclosure of the macrocyclic_lactone_analogs genus in the specification is belied by the state of the art at the time of the invention
cf
ariad 598 f.3d at 1354-55 inventor has obligation to disclose molecules when the art is unpredictable and existing knowledge scant

at the effective_filing_date very little knowledge existed regarding the use of drug-eluting_stents to inhibit restenosis
in fact cordiss cypherthe_r_stent which employs the patented technology was the first_drug-eluting_stent marketed and approved in the united_states
appellants own expert declarations detail the failure of others to develop drug-eluting_stents to inhibit restenosis and evidenced the` highly unexpected' and` remarkable clinical results seen in cordiss cypherthe_r_stent'
j.a
14739-46 ; j.a
14872-73
appellants also argued in their briefing in opposition *1365 to bscs ¡± 103 summary_judgment_motion that the state of the art was highly unpredictable
j.a
14698` [ p ] ersons of ordinary_skill were faced with a multitude of possible therapeutic approaches and a multitude of possible drug and polymer combinations
additionally these proposed solutions were anything but predictable
researchers in the field had little idea which if any would prove successful
``

indeed the shared specification of the 1997 patents acknowledges the uncertainties surrounding rapamycin restenosis and drug-eluting_stents as of the effective_filing_date of the patents
see e.g. ¡¬7286_patent col.1 ll.38-40` the exact hormonal and cellular processes promoting restenosis are still being determined
`` ; id
col.2 ll.49-52` the exact mechanism for restenosis is still under active_investigation
`` ; id
col.1 ll.54-56` the mechanisms for most agents employed [ to prevent smooth_muscle_cell_proliferation ] are still unclear
`` ; id
col.5 ll.59-60` the ideal_agent for restenosis has not yet been identified
`` ; id
col.5_ll.36-38` the precise_mechanism of rapamycin is still under active_investigation
``

this case in many respects parallels our decision in carnegie_mellon_univ
v. hoffmann-la_roche_inc. 541_f.3d_1115 1126 fed.cir.2008
in carnegie_mellon the court held that our case law regarding generic_claims is applicable to both inventions claiming novel genera of chemical and biological compounds as well as inventions claiming combinations of prior_art compounds with other_elements
541 f.3d at 1124
in carnegie_mellon the patentee argued that our holding in` eli_lilly is distinguishable from the present case because the invention in eli_lilly was tied to a specific cdna sequence whereas the invention here involves a combination of well known elements that create a generic biotechnological tool'
id.at 1122-23
the patentee argued that species of the claimed genus` were well known in the art' and that the district_court in granting summary_judgment of no written description` failed to draw inferences in [ the patentees ] favor'
id.at 1123
we rejected these arguments in carnegie_mellon and likewise find them unavailing here
the test for written description is the same whether the claim is to a novel_compound or a novel combination of known elements
the test is the same whether the claim element is essential or auxiliary to the invention
cf
aro mfg co. v. convertible top replacement co. 365_u.s._336 345 81_s.ct._599 5_l.ed.2d_592_(1961)` [ t ] here is no legally recognizable or protectedessential elementgist orheart of the invention in a combination patent
``

we conclude that in this case like carnegie_mellon summary_judgment was appropriately granted
in carnegie_mellon the court noted that only three bacterial genes out of thousands of species had been cloned and only one was disclosed in the specification
541 f.3d at 1125
the court contrasted carnegie_mellon with capon a case where the prior_art contained` extensive knowledge of the nucleotide structure' of the relevant dna including 785 mouse antibody dna light chains and 1,327 mouse antibody dna heavy chains
id
here no analogs are disclosed in the specification
while a small_number of such analogs were known in the prior_art the claims cover tens of thousands of possible macrocyclic_lactone_analogs
with no guidance at all in the specification as to how to properly identify or choose the claimed analogs and in light of the unpredictability and nascent_state of using drug-eluting_stents to treat restenosis we agree with the district_court that appellants have failed to create genuine issues of material_fact

*1366 although it is true that functional_claim_language can meet the written description_requirement when there is an established correlation between structure and function appellants fail to establish any such correlation
see e.g. univ
of rochester 358 f.3d at 925 explaining that` functional descriptions of genetic material can in some cases meet the written description_requirement if the functional characteristics are coupled with a known or disclosed correlation between function and structure' citations and internal quotations omitted
appellants contend that the declaration of dr._sabatini and prior_art_patents and articles indicate that` the structure and mechanism of action of rapamycin were known' and that` the correlation between the structural_elements of rapamycin and its mechanism of action and biological_activity was known'
see e.g. appellants br.at 43-44
in particular appellants rely on a july 1996 article from science the choi_article that discloses how rapamycin interacts with fkbp12 and mtor
j.a
11162-65
however both the choi_article and dr._sabatinis declaration directly conflict with the shared specification of the 1997 patents which explicitly states that` the precise_mechanism of rapamycin is still under active_investigation'
¡¬7286_patent col.5_ll.36-38 emphasis added

the shared specification indicates that the alleged correlation between structure and function was not well known by the effective_filing_date
dr._sabatinis declaration explains that based on the choi_article rapamycin must first bind to fkbp12 via rapamycins pipecolinyl_ring to form a rapamycin/fkbp12 complex in order to inhibit restenosis
j.a
10556
then this rapamycin/fkbp12 complex binds with mtor
id
specifically rapamycins triene_group interacts with mtor
id
therefore dr._sabatinis declaration indicates that rapamycins structural_features that allow it to function to inhibit restenosis are 1 the pipecolinyl_ring and 2 the triene_group
however the specification of the 1997 patents is silent about the need for the claimed analogs to maintain these two structural_features

when determining whether a specification contains adequate written description one must make an` objective inquiry into the four corners of the specification from the perspective of a person of ordinary_skill in the art'
ariad 598 f.3d at 1351
because the specification is viewed from the perspective of one of skill in some circumstances a patentee may rely on information that is` well-known in the art' for purposes of meeting the written description_requirement
see falko-gunter falkner v. inglis 448_f.3d_1357 1366-68 fed.cir.2006
however when the four corners of the specification directly contradict information that the patentee alleges is` well-known' to a person of skill at the effective_filing_date no reasonable_jury could conclude that the patentee possessed the invention
here the specification of the 1997 patents itself refutes any conclusion that` the structural_elements of rapamycin and its mechanism of action and biological_activity was known'
see univ
of rochester 358 f.3d at 930` although section 282 places the burden of proof on the party seeking to invalidate a patent it does not foreclose the possibility of that party demonstrating that the patent in suit proves its own invalidity`
thus there is insufficient correlation between the function and structure of rapamycin and its analogs to provide adequate written description_support for the entire genus of macrocyclic_lactone_analogs of rapamycin

given the absence of information regarding structural characteristics of macrocyclic_lactone_analogs or examples of *1367 macrocyclic_lactone_analogs in the specification the unpredictability of the art and the nascent_state of using drug-eluting_stents to inhibit restenosis we affirm the district_courts grant of summary_judgment
the patent laws do not reward an inventors invitation to other researchers to discover which of the thousands of macrocyclic_lactone_analogs of rapamycin could conceivably work in a drug-eluting_stent
because we affirm the district_courts holding that no reasonable_jury could conclude that the 1997 patents contained sufficient written description_support we need not separately address appellants arguments regarding enablement

ii
the ¡¬662_patent
the ¡¬662_patent claims` rapamycin or a macrocyclic_triene_analog thereof' in combination with specific drug-eluting_stents
therefore we must analyze whether a reasonable_juror could conclude that the inventors of the ¡¬662_patent were in possession of the claimed genus of` macrocyclic_triene_analogs' in combination with the other claim elements
although appellants make many of the same arguments regarding the ¡¬662_patent as they did for the 1997 patents appellants argue that the ¡¬662_patent sets forth even more_information regarding rapamycin and its analogs
we agree with the district_court that no reasonable_juror could determine that the specification adequately describes the claimed genus of` macrocyclic_triene_analogs'

as shown by appellants own experts at the effective_filing_date of the ¡¬ 662 patent researchers continued to struggle to find compounds that would work in a drug-eluting_stent to prevent restenosis
j.a
14739-46 ; j.a
14872-73
therefore at the time of effective_filing_date of the ¡¬662_patent such technology was still in its infancy
despite this fact the ¡¬ 662 patent fails to disclose even a single member of either the genus of` analogs' of rapamycin or the more specific genus of` macrocyclic_triene_analogs' of rapamycin
in fact even though the specification of the ¡¬662_patent contains more_information regarding rapamycin and discloses the broad_genus of` analogs' of rapamycin it never discloses the sub-genus of` macrocyclic_triene_analogs' of rapamycin
instead the only mention of the term` macrocyclic_triene' in the patent_specification is the statement that` [ r ] apamycin is a macroyclic [ sic ] triene antibiotic'
¡¬662_patent col.5 l.31

in fujikawa v. wattanasin 93_f.3d_1559 1570 fed.cir.1996 we addressed the written description_requirement in a situation where a patentee claimed a sub-genus that was not disclosed ipsis verbis in the specification
there as here instead of disclosing the sub-genus the patentee disclosed only the broader genus
id
we held that in the absence of blaze marks` as to what compounds other than those disclosed as preferred might be of special_interest.. simply describing a large genus of compounds is not sufficient to satisfy the written description_requirement as to particular species or sub-genuses'
id.at 1570-71
here the inventors similarly disclosed a genus analogs of rapamycin but claimed a narrower_sub-genus macrocyclic_triene_analogs of rapamycin
however nothing in the ¡¬662_patent indicates that the claimed triene_analogs might be of special_interest
given the nascent_state of using drug-eluting_stents to treat restenosis at this time the lack of such blaze marks in the ¡¬662_patent prevents any conclusion that the patent contains sufficient written description of the claimed triene_analogs of rapamycin
no reasonable_juror could determine that the specification` reasonably convey [ s ] to persons skilled in the art that the inventor had *1368 possession' of the claimed sub-genus
id.at 1570

moreover the functional disclosures in the ¡¬662_patent fail to sufficiently describe the claimed sub-genus of macrocyclic_triene_analogs or provide sufficient blaze marks as to which analogs might successfully work in drug-eluting_stents
even at the 2001 effective_filing_date the relationship between the function of rapamycin and its structure was not so well known that it excuses the patentees failure to explicitly disclose the claimed subgenus or any species within the sub-genus
like the 1997 patents the ¡¬662_patent confirms that the mechanism of action of rapamycin was not well known at the effective_filing_date
although the patent explains the binding of rapamycin to fkbp12 to form a complex and the subsequent binding of this complex to mtor the patent also admits that` [ t ] he molecular events that are responsible for the actions of rapamycin a known anti-proliferative which acts to reduce the magnitude and duration of neointimal_hyperplasia are still being elucidated'
¡¬662_patent col.5 l.62-col.6 l.3

furthermore the ¡¬662_patent states that` [ r ] apamycin functions to inhibit smooth_muscle_cell_proliferation through a number of mechanisms'
id
col.5 ll.43-44
the patent then gives details regarding how the compound and its analogs function including stating that` there is evidence that rapamycin may also inhibit the other major component of restenosis namely negative_remodeling'
id
col.6 ll.12-14
however the specification states that it is unknown how rapamycin functions to inhibit negative_remodeling it may be hypothesized that rapamycin acts to reduce negative_remodeling in several ways
by specifically blocking the proliferation of fibroblasts in the vascular wall in response to injury rapamycin may reduce the formation of vascular scar tissue
rapamycin may also affect the translation of key proteins involved in collagen formation or metabolism
id
col.7 ll.22-27
thus the ¡¬662_patent indicates that the mechanism of action corresponding to the function of rapamycin and its analogs is still under investigation
as with the 1997 patents this characterization of the state of the art directly contradicts appellants assertion that there was a well known correlation between the structure of rapamycin and its function

the ¡¬662_patent also contains insufficient support for the highly specific_functional_requirements claimed
for example claim 1 which is representative of all of the independent claims of the ¡¬662_patent requires` from about 64 £gg to about 197 £gg of rapamycin or a macrocyclic_triene_analog thereof.. wherein said device provides an in-stent_late_loss in diameter at 12 months following implantation in a human of less than about 0.5 mm [ ]'
the ¡¬662_patent includes no information suggesting how a person of skill in the art would select macrocyclic_triene_analogs with such highly specific performance requirements
there is also no indication of which structural_features of analogs of rapamycin are necessary to achieve these results
although it is possible that one could use trial and error one would have to wait a full year in order to determine whether a specific_analog in combination with the other claimed elements achieved the claimed results
the specification fails to convey to one of skill in the art that the inventors were in possession of any analogs that achieve these highly specific results as the written description_requirement mandates

given the state of the art and the lack of any successful combination of elements a person of skill in the art would expect *1369 more than the meager_disclosure of` analogs' in the ¡¬662_patent
the specification fails to disclose the sub-genus of` macrocyclic_triene_analogs' by name by functionality or even by implication
the specification similarly fails to disclose a single_species of` macrocyclic_triene_analogs' or a single_species of any analog of rapamycin
furthermore the plethora of test results in the ¡¬ 662 patent are devoted exclusively to rapamycin itself with no results from the testing of analogs
given the paucity of disclosure regarding the claimed sub-genus no reasonable_juror could conclude that the specification of the ¡¬ 662 patent discloses to a person of ordinary_skill in the art that the inventors were in possession of the claimed invention

conclusion
we hold that no reasonable_juror could determine that the asserted claims of the patents-in-suit contain adequate written description of the claimed analogs of rapamycin
therefore we affirm the judgment of the district_court

affirmed

gajarsa circuit_judge concurring-in-part
i agree with the majority that the asserted claims of u.s._patent_nos._7217,286 the` ¡¬7286_patent` ; 7,223,286 ; 7,229,473 collectively the` 1997 patents' ; and 7,300,662 the` ¡¬662_patent` are invalid but would hold the 1997 patents invalid for lack of enablement
therefore i concur only in judgment as to the 1997 patents
i join fully the majoritys opinion regarding the ¡¬662_patent

the claimed invention is a combination of a stent polymeric carrier and therapeutic_agent
the majority focuses solely on the written description aspect of whether the therapeutic_agents analogs were adequately described and ignores that in nearly all of the asserted claims the agents must effectively inhibit neointimal_proliferation
because undue_experimentation was required to practice the 1997 patents the district_courts grant of summary_judgment of invalidity should have been affirmed on enablement grounds

the enablement_requirement of 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
1 is the appropriate tool for invalidating claims that are broader than their disclosure
the majority blurs the line between enablement and written description and does not address the claim_language that` rapamycin or a macrocyclic_lactone_analog thereof and is present in an amount effective to inhibit neointimal_proliferation'
¡¬ 7286 patent col.8 ll.15-23 emphasis added

the majoritys opinion further extends the written description_requirement into the realm of enablement
much of the confusion in this case is due to the difficulty of determining what constitutes a genus or a subgenus the relationship between the structure and the function of compounds and how the written description_requirement applies to novel_compounds as opposed to novel combinations of known elements
these are legal inquiries predicated on disputed issues of material_fact
applying the enablement_requirement would help to clear the thicket of jurisprudence regarding ¡± 112 ?
1
as discussed briefly below in this case the enablement analysis is simpler and more appropriate

the relevant test for enablement is whether the specification enables one of skill in the art to practice the claimed invention without undue_experimentation
in re wands lists the factors to be considered in determining whether a disclosure would require undue_experimentation
858_f.2d_731 737 fed.cir.1988
the district_court correctly applied the wands *1370 factors and held that practicing the claimed invention with a macrocyclic_lactone_analog would have required undue_experimentation in 1997
the district_court noted that` there is no direction or guidance disclosed in the patents and no working examples' factors 2_and_3 ;` the claims are moderately broad insofar as there is no limit aside from function determined through experimentation regarding the number of potential_analogs' factor 8 ;` there is no genuine dispute that the invention concerns a very complex chemical and biomechanical art germane to highly skilled cardiologists' factors 4_and_6 ;` the 1997 patents were filed on the heels of a decade marked by failed attempts to reduce restenosis' factor 5 ; and` the chemical arts have long been acknowledged to be unpredictable' factor 7
boston_scientific v. johnson & johnson 679_f.supp.2d_539 557 d.del.2010
these findings were consistent with appellants opposition to appellees ¡± 103 motion
the appellants argued that` the development of the cypher stent required trial-and-error experimentation with many drugs and polymers'
j.a
17718

to satisfy a majority of the asserted claims a rapamycin_analog not only needs to generally prevent restenosis but must also prevent restenosis when used on a drug-eluting_stent
once rapamycins structure was known scientists could hypothesize that useful analogs could potentially be created by changing parts of that molecule particularly outside of the critical macrocyclic ring structure
the 1997 patents did not need to explain how to synthesize identify or determine the biological_activity of a suitable macrocyclic_lactone_analog
the patents did however need to disclose where the rapamycin_molecule should be modified to obtain a suitable analog with the desired efficacy in stents
it is not enough that a person of ordinary_skill in 1997 could have readily determined whether a compound was a claimed macrocyclic_lactone ; for most of the claims the analog needed to prevent restenosis when used on a drug eluting_stent
because no one knew of any rapamycin_analogs with the desired efficacy when delivered by stents as of the filing_date of the 1997 patents appellants claims are not enabled

the claims of the 1997 patents are invalid for lack of enablement but because the majority decided that the asserted claims were invalid solely for lack of written description i concur only in the judgment as to those patents
