background
the inventors loren c. covington and howard r. palmer employees of appellee to whom they have assigned their invention and the application thereon filed an application on march_29,_1974 serial no._455964 to patent an alloy they developed
the application involved on this appeal is a continuation-in-part thereof filed july_25,_1975 containing the three claims on appeal
the alloy is made primarily of titanium ti and contains small amounts of nickel ni and molybdenum mo as alloying ingredients to give the alloy certain desirable properties particularly corrosion_resistance in hot_brine solutions while retaining workability so that articles such as tubing can be fabricated from it by rolling welding and other techniques
the inventors apparently also found that iron content should be limited iron being an undesired impurity rather than an alloying ingredient
they determined the permissible ranges of the components above and below which the desired properties were not obtained
a precise definition of the invention sought to be patented is found in the claims set forth below claim 3 representing the preferred composition it being understood however that no iron at all would be even more preferred
1
a titanium_base_alloy consisting essentially by weight of about 0.6 % to 0.9 %_nickel 0.2 % to 0.4 %_molybdenum up to 0.2 %_maximum_iron balance_titanium said alloy being characterized by good_corrosion_resistance in hot_brine_environments
2
a titanium_base_alloy as set forth in claim 1 having up to 0.1 %_iron balance_titanium
3
a titanium_base_alloy as set forth in claim 1_having_08 %_nickel 0.3 %_molybdenum up to 0.1 %_maximum_iron balance_titanium

the examiners final rejection repeated in his answer on appeal to the patent and trademark_office pto board of appeals board was on the grounds that claims 1_and_2 are anticipated fully met by and claim 3 would have been obvious from an article by kalabukhova and mikheyew investigation of the mechanical properties of ti-mo-ni alloys russian metallurgy metally no._3 pages 130-133 1970 in the court below and hereinafter called` the russian_article' under 35 u.s.c.¡±¡± 102_and_103 respectively
the board affirmed the examiners rejection
however it mistakenly proceeded on the assumption that all three claims had been rejected as anticipated under ¡± 102 by the russian_article and ignored the obviousness rejection
on this appeal the pto says it does not pursue the ¡± 103 rejection further
appellee proceeds on the basis that only the ¡± 102 rejection is before us

both the examiner and the board had before them as evidence three affidavits by rosenberg palmer and hall and a declaration by minkler by which they were not persuaded of patentability

the russian_article is short 3 pages highly technical and contains 10 graphs as part of the discussion
as its title indicates it relates to ternary ti-mo-ni alloys the subject of the application at bar
the examiner and the board both found that it would disclose to one skilled in the art an *777 alloy on which at least claims 1_and_2 read so that those claims would not be allowable under the statute because of lack of novelty of their subject_matter
since the article does not specifically disclose such an alloy in words a little thinking is required about what it would disclose to one knowledgeable about ti-ni-mo alloys
the pto did that thinking as follows figure lc [ a graph ] shows data for the ternary titanium_alloy which contains mo and ni in the ratio of 1:3
amongst the actual points on the graph is one at 1 %_mo + ni
at this point the amounts of mo and ni would be 0.25 % and 0.75 % respectively
a similar point appears on the graph shown in figure 2 of the article
... appellants do not deny that the data_points are disclosed in the reference
in fact the hall affidavit indicates at least two specific points at 1 % and 1.25 %_mo + ni which would represent a description of alloys falling within the scope of the instant claims

on that basis the board found that the claimed alloys were not new because they were disclosed in the prior_art
it having been argued that the russian_article contains no disclosure of corrosion-resistant properties of any of the alloys the board held the fact that a particular_property or the end use for this alloy as contemplated by appellants was not recognized in the article is of no consequence
it therefore held the russian_article to be an anticipation noting that although the article does not discuss corrosion_resistance it does disclose other properties such as strength and ductility
the pto further points out that the authors of the reference must have made the alloys to obtain the data_points

being dissatisfied with the decision of the board titanium_metals_corporation of america as assignee of the covington and palmer application then brought an action in the district_court for the district of columbia against the commissioner pursuant to 35 u.s.c.¡± 145 its complaint alleging that the boards decision` was erroneous and contrary to law' and making profert of a certified copy of the application and all papers in the file thereof together with a copy of the russian_article which was the sole basis of the pto refusal to allow the claims
it prayed that the court adjudge it entitled to a patent containing claims 1-3 and authorize the commissioner to grant such a patent
the commissioner filed an answer denying that the applicants were the first inventors of the alloys claimed or entitled to a patent alleging that the claims are not patentable under the law and making profert of the examiners answer the board of appeals decision and the prior_art reference

the case came on for trial on january 24 1980 before the honorable john g. penn and was concluded in two and a half hours
the testimony of one witness was heard by the court dr. james c. williams professor at carnegie-mellon university in pittsburgh and an expert in titanium_metallurgy
his testimony was about equally divided between direct and cross_examination

at the conclusion of the plaintiffs case the following exchange took place between the judge and the associate solicitor for the pto the court all right
mr. tarring ?
mr. tarring your honor generally the position of the patent office is we rely on the position of the tribunals below the examiner and the board of appeals and their decisions are both present in the exhibit which i submitted earlier
i was not quite sure whether you would prefer that we have a post-trial brief in the matter
if thats your preference we could do that or i could make an argument on the basis of the law right now
i do n't know what your preference would be
otherwise im not going to call any witnesses
the court you are not going to what ?
mr. tarring i have no intention of calling any witnesses so its really a matter of argument at this point i think
*778 the court of course i have received your pre-trial briefs
after further discussion it was settled that both parties would file further briefs after the hearing transcript had been prepared
they were filed in april and may 1980
on november 16 1984 the district_court entered the order appealed from followed on november 28 by a supporting memorandum_opinion
january 10 1985 the pto filed its notice of appeal
this court has heard oral argument and received briefs

the district_court opinion
the trial_courts memorandum_opinion2 having been published we shall merely outline its contents

after stating the nature of the action and the relief sought part i is a summarization of the contents of the patent specification a statement of the issues and of the pto rejection which is stated both correctly as the examiner made it and incorrectly as the board assumed it to be
part ii is a statement of the district of columbia circuit court of appeals attitude toward plaintiffs burden on review of the pto board decisions in ¡± 145 actions namely that it is a` heavy burden'` great weight' being given to the pto_decision because of its` expertise' a` thorough_conviction' that it erred being required as well as a lack of a` rational basis for its conclusions'
in part iii is a brief discussion of` anticipation' under ¡± 102 with citation of two cases from our predecessor court of customs and patent appeals in re_wilder 429_f.2d_447 57_c.c.p.a._1314 166_upsq_545_(1970) and in re legrice 301_f.2d_929 49_c.c.p.a._1124 133_uspq_365_(1962) with emphasis placed on their holdings that an anticipatory reference must be an` enabling' reference the implication being that the russian_article perhaps does not enable one to know all the things that the plaintiffs inventors disclosed in their application such as the range_limits of the alloying ingredients mo and ni and the corrosion_resistance
the court then states that after considering all of the affidavit and declaration evidence which was before the pto it still lacked the necessary` thorough_conviction' required to overturn the pto_decision even though left to its own judgment of the evidence it would be willing to do so
it then reviewed the evidence of dr._williams taken before it
dr._williams was qualified as an expert in titanium_metallurgy but not in patent_law
the questions he was asked however pertained to the interpretation of patent claims as quoted in the courts opinion
the court was of the view that his testimony` fully supports the arguments made by the plaintiff in this case' and found it` to be very persuasive'
the court then concluded that claims 1-3 were not anticipated and that claim 3 was wrongly rejected as directed to obvious subject_matter
in the courts view dr._williams testimony tipped the scales in favor of issuing a patent

opinion
1
jurisdiction
this suit was brought in the district_court pursuant to 35 u.s.c.¡± 145
our jurisdiction rests on 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 4 c which provides as follows ¡± 1295
jurisdiction of the united_states_court of appeals for the federal_circuit
( a the united_states_court of appeals for the federal_circuit shall have exclusive jurisdiction-.. 4 of an appeal from a decision of-.. c a district_court to which a case was directed pursuant to section 145_or_146 of title 35 ;..
this case having been directed to the district_court for the district of columbia by ¡± 145 this courts jurisdiction is exclusive of the court of appeals for the district of *779 columbia and is therefore governed by the precedents of this court and its predecessor courts
see south corporation v. united_states 690_f.2d_1368 215_uspq_657_(fed.cir.1982)

strange as it may seem to any district judge not to be governed by the precedents of his own court of appeals that is the situation created by congress in the federal courts improvement act of 1982 ¡± 402 of pub.l
97-164 apr._2,_1982 96_stat._37 effective oct._1,_1982 in the interest of promoting a uniform patent_law by having only one court of appeals deciding questions of patent_law whether review be of decisions of the patent and trademark_office or of district_court judgments in cases arising under the patent_laws of the united_states
cf.¡± 1295 a 1
we do not fault the district judge however for having stated the precedents of his own circuit in this ¡± 145 case because this is one of the first occasions we have had to review a judgment in such a case
nor do we need to determine whether we should apply those precedents here

2
the rejections under review
tracing the pto rejections under review below we encounter confusion
although we are reviewing the judgment in the form of an order of the district_court,3 the effect of that order is to hold that the ptos rejections of claims 1-3 were in error
the actual holding of the district_court was

the court concludes that claims 1 2_and_3 should not have been rejected on the basis of anticipation pursuant to 35 u.s.c.¡± 102
moreover the court concludes that claim 3 should not have been rejected as being obvious pursuant to 35 u.s.c.¡± 103
thus the court finds as a fact and concludes as a matter of law that the decision of the board of appeals was in error
the testimony of dr._williams which remains uncontradicted adds sufficient weight to the plaintiffs side to tip the scales and in the courts view to result in clear and convincing evidence that the application should not have been rejected
thus the court deemed all three claims to have been rejected for anticipation under ¡± 102
the examiner never so rejected claim 3
the board opinion as above noted erroneously assumed that he had never gave any special or separate attention to claim 3 never discussed obviousness or ¡± 103 and concluded its opinion with the words` the decision of the examiner is affirmed'
the board made no new rejection as it might have done under 37 c.f.r.¡± 196 b
under these circumstances we shall assume that the board intended to and did affirm only the rejection that the examiner had made as we have stated at the beginning and that the only rejection outstanding against claim 3 is for obviousness under ¡± 103
the district_court assumed there were two outstanding rejections against claim 3
we have reduced it to one

the appellee because it quite evidently suits its argument best has preferred to ignore the ¡± 103 rejection of claim 3 but we do not because it exists in the official record

the pto brief says the commissioner` is not pursuing' the ¡± 103 rejection in this court but it is before us whether or not pursued by the pto
the pto solicitor developed a new theory in his brief never propounded by either the examiner or the board to support a ¡± 102 rejection of claim 3 on the russian_article,4 but that *780 was clearly beyond his province and we disregard it as amounting to a new ground of rejection
we also disregard it as contrary to many holdings of this court and its predecessors that anticipation under ¡± 102 can be found only when the reference discloses exactly what is claimed and that where there are differences between the reference disclosure and the claim the rejection must be based on ¡± 103 which takes differences into account
d. chisum patents ¡± 3.02

we have undertaken to settle the question whether we are dealing with one ground of rejection or two for the further reason that the standard of review of this court may vary in accordance with what the rejection is and whether it is considered to be a finding of fact or a conclusion of law
we have held that anticipation is a finding of fact reviewable under the` clearly erroneous' standard shatterproof glass corp. v. libbey-owens ford co. 758_f.2d_613 225_uspq_634_(fed.cir.1985) and that obviousness is a conclusion of law not subject to that restraint but is freely reviewable
gardner v. tec systems inc. 725_f.2d_1338 1344 220_uspq_777 782 fed.cir.1984
that may make a difference in our review

3
the merits
finding as we do that claim 3 was never purposefully rejected under ¡± 102 both the board and the district_court being confused about that fact we are left with the propriety of the rejection of claims 1_and_2 under ¡± 102 and the rejection of claim 3 under ¡± 103 both rejections having been held by the district_court to have been erroneous
that necessarily follows from the courts conclusion` that the claims are patentable'
we find that conclusion contrary to statutory law and will deal with the two grounds of rejection separately

a
anticipation ¡± 102
from consideration of the trial_courts memorandum_opinion we are unable to determine whether it erred because of miscontruction of the claims misreading of what the reference discloses lack of proper advice on the requirements of the patent statute respecting patentability or the technical legal meaning of` anticipation' a term which some courts have erroneously used from time to time

we are left in no doubt that the court was impressed by the totality of the evidence that the applicants for patent had discovered or invented and disclosed knowledge which is not to be found in the reference nor do we have any doubt about that ourselves
but those facts are beside the point
the patent_law imposes certain fundamental conditions for patentability paramount among them being the condition that what is sought to be patented as determined by the claims be new
the basic provision of title 35 applicable here is ¡± 101 providing in relevant part` whoever invents or discovers any new.. composition of matter or any new.. improvement thereof may obtain a patent therefor subject to the conditions and requirements of this title'
( emphasis ours
the title of the application here involved is` titanium_alloy' a composition of matter
surprisingly in all of the evidence nobody discussed the key issue of whether the alloy was new which is the essence of the anticipation issue including the expert dr._williams
plaintiffs counsel bringing dr._williams testimony to its climax after he had explained the nature of the ingredients the alloys made therefrom and their superior corrosion_resistance in hot_brine *781 etc. repetitively asked him such questions as` does the [ russian ] article direct you as one skilled in the art to a titanium_alloy having nickel present in an amount between6 and9 percent molybdenum in an amount between2 and4 percent ?'
( emphasis ours followed by` is there anything mentioned in the article about corrosion_resistance ?'
of course the answers were emphatically negative
but this and like testimony does not deal with the critical question do claims 1_and_2 to which the questions obviously relate read on or encompass an alloy which was already known by reason of the disclosure of the russian_article ?

section 102 the usual basis for rejection for lack of novelty or anticipation lays down certain principles for determining the novelty required by ¡± 101 among which are the provisions in ¡± 102 a and b that the claimed invention has not been` described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country' either a before the invention by the applicant or b more than one year before the application date to which he is entitled strictly a` loss of right' provision similar to novelty
either provision applies in this case the russian_article having a date some 5 years prior to the filing date and its status as` prior_art' not being questioned
the pto was never specific as to what part of ¡± 102 applies merely rejecting on ¡± 102
the question therefore is whether claims 1_and_2 encompass and if allowed would enable plaintiff-appellee to exclude others from making using or selling an alloy described in the russian_article
see 35 u.s.c.¡± 154
kalman v. kimberly-clark corp. 713_f.2d_760 218_uspq_781_(fed.cir.1983)

to answer the question we need only turn to the affidavit of james_a
hall a metallurgist employed by appellees timet division who undertook to analyze the russian_article disclosure by calculating the ingredient percentages shown in the graph data_points which he presented in tabular form
there are 15 items in his table
the second item shows a titanium_base_alloy containing 0.25 % by weight mo and 0.75 %_ni and this is squarely within the ranges of 0.2-0.4 %_mo and 0.6-0.9 %_ni of claims 1_and_2
as to that disclosed alloy of the prior_art there can be no question that claims 1_and_2 read on it and would be infringed by anyone making using or selling it
therefore the statute prohibits a patent containing them
this seems to be a case either of not adequately considering the novelty requirement of the statute the true meaning of the correlative term` anticipation' or the meaning of the claims

by reason of the courts quotations from cases holding that a reference is not an anticipation which does not enable one skilled in the art to practice the claimed invention it appears that the trial_court thought there was some deficiency in the russian_article on that score
enablement in this case involves only being able to make the alloy given the ingredients and their proportions without more
the evidence here however clearly answers that question in two ways
appellees own patent application does not undertake to tell anyone how to make the alloy it describes and seeks to patent
it assumes that those skilled in the art would know how
secondly appellees expert dr._williams testified on cross_examination that given the alloy information in the russian_article he would know how to prepare the alloys` by at least three techniques'
enablement is not a problem in this case

as we read the situation the court was misled by the arguments and evidence to the effect that the inventors here found out and disclosed in their application many things that one can not learn from reading the russian_article and that this was sufficient in law to justify granting them a patent for their contributions-such things as what good_corrosion_resistance the claimed alloys have against hot_brine which possibly was not known and the range_limits of the ni and mo content outside of which that resistance diminishes which are teachings of very useful information
these things the applicants teach the art and the russian_article does not
indeed appellees counsel argued in his opening *782 statement to the trial_court that the ptos refusal of a patent was` directly contrary to the requirement of article i section 8 of the constitution' which authorizes congress to create a patent_law
but throughout the trial counsel never came to grips with the real issues 1 what do the claims cover and 2 is what they cover new ?
under the laws congress wrote they must be considered
congress has not seen fit to permit the patenting of an old alloy known to others through a printed publication by one who has discovered its corrosion_resistance or other useful properties or has found out to what extent one can modify the composition of the alloy without losing such properties

it is also possible that the trial_court did not properly interpret the claims and took them to be directed only to the applicants discoveries about the properties of the alloys instead of to the alloys themselves as they are possibly because of the phrase at the end of claim 1` characterized by good_corrosion_resistance in hot_brine_environments' which applies to the other two dependent claims also
no light is shed by its opinion on what the court thought the claims mean as the opinion does not construe the claims
until it has been definitely determined what subject_matter is being claimed it is not known what it is that the pto held to be unpatentable
claim interpretation which is the logical starting point of the analysis is a question of law free from the clearly erroneous standard of review
raytheon co. v. roper corp. 724_f.2d_951 956 220_uspq_592 596 fed.cir.1983
it is the correct and necessary construction of all three claims that they simply define titanium_base_alloys
claims 1_and_2 state certain narrow limits within which the alloying ingredients mo and ni are present and necessarily cover a number of alloys
claim 3 is specific to a single alloy
this said it is immaterial on the issue of their novelty what inherent properties the alloys have or whether these applicants discovered certain inherent properties

the trial_court and appellee have relied on in re_wilder supra but they have both failed to note those portions of that opinion most relevant to the present case
the issue there as here was anticipation of certain claims
wilder argued` that even though there may be a technical anticipation the discovery of the new property and the recitation of this property in the claimslends patentable novelty to the claims'
the court answered however recitation in a claim to a composition of a particular_property said to be possessed by the recited composition be that property newly-discovered or not does not necessarily change the scope of the subject_matter otherwise defined by that claim
[ 429 f.2d at 450 57_c.c.p.a._1314 166 upsq at 548 ]
the court in that case also said [ w ] e start with the proposition that claims can not be obtained to that which is not new
this was the basis of the holding in in re thuau [ 135_f.2d_344 30_c.c.p.a._979 57_uspq_324_(ccpa_1943) ]
it was the law then is now and will be until congress decrees otherwise
[ id ]
it is also an elementary principle of patent_law that when as by a recitation of ranges or otherwise a claim covers several compositions the claim is` anticipated' if one of them is in the prior_art
in re petering 301_f.2d_676 682 49_c.c.p.a._993 1001 133_uspq_275 280 1962

for all of the foregoing reasons the court below committed clear error and legal error in authorizing the issuance of a patent on claims 1_and_2 since properly construed they are anticipated under ¡± 102 by the russian_article which admittedly discloses an alloy on which these claims read

b. obviousness ¡± 103
little more need be said in support of the examiners rejection of claim 3 affirmed by the board on the ground that its more specific subject_matter would have been obvious at the time the invention was *783 made from the knowledge disclosed in the reference

as admitted by appellees affidavit evidence from james_a
hall the russian_article discloses two alloys having compositions very close to that of claim 3 which is 0.3 %_mo and 0.8 %_ni balance_titanium
the two alloys in the prior_art have 0.25 %_mo-0.75 %_ni and 0.31 %_mo-0.94 %_ni respectively
the proportions are so close that prima facie one skilled in the art would have expected them to have the same properties
appellee produced no evidence to rebut that prima facie case
the specific alloy of claim 3 must therefore be considered to have been obvious from known alloys

conclusion
for the foregoing reasons the decision and order of the district_court holding that claims 1 2 and 3 are directed to patentable subject_matter and authorizing the issuance of a patent thereon were clearly erroneous and are reversed

the order entered nov._16,_1984 after preliminary recitations reads as follows ordered that the commissioner of patents and trademarks is authorized to issue to plaintiff titanium_metals_corporation of america as assignee and owner of application serial no._598935 united_states letters patent on titanium_alloy including claims nos._1 2_and_3 in due form as prescribed by the patent laws of the united_states
the ultimate issue actually before us is whether the patent_laws permit the commissioner to issue such a patent
4
resting on the fact that the russian article discloses an alloy containing 0.75 %_ni and 0.25 %_mo the solicitors argument is as follows moreover this alloy falls within the scope of claim 3 which specifies 0.8 %_nickel 0.3 %_molybdenum up to 0.1 %_iron and balance_titanium
inasmuch as this claim specifies the content of nickel and molybdenum to a tenth of a percent the claim given the broadest reasonable interpretation would cover alloys the amounts of whose contents would correspond to the claim language when expressed in tenths of a percent
following the usual convention of rounding off hundredths to tenths by increasing the tenths digit by one when the hundredths digit to be dropped is five or greater the alloy of the russian_article expressed in tenths of a percent would contain 0.8 %_nickel 0.3 %_molybdenum and balance_titanium corresponding to the alloy specified in tenths of a percent in claim 3
