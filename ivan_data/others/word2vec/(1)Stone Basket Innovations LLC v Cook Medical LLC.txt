the327_patent relates to a basket-type stone extraction medical device used to remove stones from biological_systems
see327_patent abstract col. 1_ll._9 -12
the claimed extraction basket includes a` support filament' such as a wire with a slideable outer sheath` a handle comprising a sheath_movement_element' and a` collapsible' wire basket used to collect the stone

in january 2016 cook deposed the327_patents inventor during which he was asked questions about his contact with stones managing members daniel mitry and timothy salmon and the conception and filing of the327_patent

then in april 2016 the parties filed a joint motion to stay the case pending the patent trial and appeal board` ptab's consideration of cooks petition for an ipr which the district_court granted
j.a

in september 2016 the ptab instituted an ipr on all claims of the327_patent
stone_basket_ii 2017_wl_2655612 at *3
following the ptabs institution one of stones managing members offered to license the327_patent to cook in exchange for $ 150,000.00

the district_court did not abuse its discretion in denying cooks ¡± 285 motion
this appeal involves two main issues namely whether the district_court erred in its assessment of 1 the substantive_strength of stones litigating_position and 2 the alleged_pattern of vexatious_litigation by stone
we address these issues in turn

a
the substantive strength of stones litigating position
under octane a district_court may consider` the substantive_strength of a partys litigating_position' when determining if the case` stands out from others'
134 s.ct.at 1756
the district_court analyzed the record-including the327_patents prosecution history and prior_art the inventors deposition_testimony concerning the sheaths` novelty' and stones decision to cancel its patent-yet ultimately found these factors did not demonstrate that stone had` willfully ignored the prior_art *1179 or failed to evaluate its case' or that stones` actions were.. objectively unreasonable in light of the circumstances'

appellants br

we disagree with cook

the district_court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the substantive_strength of stones ultimately non-prevailing litigating_position did not warrant an award of fees
cook submitted two primary pieces of evidence to support its arguments for exceptionality-cooks invalidity_contentions served in the eastern_district and the327_patents inventor_testimony
the district_court did not abuse its discretion in finding that neither piece of evidence taken alone or together warranted a finding of exceptionality

first the district_court did not err in finding stone lacked any type of` clear_notice' of the327_patents invalidity by service of cooks invalidity_contentions
id.at 25 ; see stone_basket_ii 2017_wl_2655612 at *4
although cook focuses on the obviousness of the327_patent over u.s._patent_no._6168,603` leslie' on appeal that reference was not the focus of cooks invalidity_contentions which listed leslie along with thirty-one other pieces of prior_art as anticipatory_references
j.a
1601-02 ; see also j.a
1602 singling out only other prior_art references gilson and greenhalgh-not leslie-from that list of thirty-two
after providing that list of thirty-two references cook made the general statement that` [ e ] ach prior_art reference disclosed above [ in the list of thirty-two ] either alone or in combination.. renders the asserted claims invalid as obvious' j.a
1602 included a legal standard section for motivation to combine j.a
1603-05 and attached inconsistent and unilluminating claim charts see e.g. j.a
1614-25 attaching claim charts lacking inclusion of leslie j.a
1601 1614 1619 referencing u.s._patent_no._6383,196` the196_patent` which is another patent issued to leslie in the claim chart for only two of claim 1s seven claim limitations despite the fact that cook includes the196_patent in its list of anticipatory_references
the eastern_districts local patent rules governing invalidity_contentions require that` each such combination and the motivation to combine such items must be identified' and` [ a ] chart identifying where specifically in each alleged item of prior_art each element of each asserted claim is found'
e.d
tex
p.r
3-3 b c1 while compliance with local_patent_rules is not always necessary to provide` clear_notice' of invalidity cooks invalidity_contentions at minimum fall short of notifying stone how leslie renders the327_patent obvious-or even that stone should conduct a focused investigation on whether leslie in particular renders the327_patent obvious

moreover leslie is listed on the face of the327_patent see327_patent references cited and when prior_art` is listed on the face' of a patent` the examiner is presumed to have considered it' shire llc v. amneal pharm. llc 802_f.3d_1301 1307 fed
cir
2015
we have explained that where a party only relies on prior_art considered by an examiner in its invalidity_contentions that party has the burden to` overcome [ e ] the deference that is due to a qualified government agency presumed to have properly done its job which includes one or more examiners who *1180 are assumed to have some expertise in interpreting the references and.. whose duty it is to issue only valid patents'

having been issued a valid patent stone was entitled to a presumption of good_faith in asserting its patent rights against cook in the form of a suit for infringement

cooks invalidity_contentions based on prior_art already considered by the examiner and with no further explanation do not make the substantive_strength of stones position exceptional

second while one might view stones litigating_position as weak given the inventors deposition_testimony regarding the novelty and origin of claim 1s sheath handle element see j.a
1504-05 1510 1526-27 a strong or even correct litigating_position is not the standard by which we assess exceptionality see sfa sys. llc v. newegg inc. 793_f.3d_1344 1348 fed

`` a partys position on issues of law ultimately need not be correct for them to notstand [ ] out or be found reasonable'

we decline cooks invitation to take out of context the inventors testimony including that the327_patents hired illustrator used the cook basket handle as inspiration for a portion of the327_patents figure 1
see j.a
1504-05 1510 stating by inventor that the327_patents representations were` based on'` the cook handle'

moreover contrary to cooks argument an inventors testimony that` there is nothing novel about [ the sheath movement ]' j.a
1510 taken alone neither` establishe [ s ] the invalidity of the patent on obviousness grounds' nor constitutes a` material false statement [ ] to the [ us ] pto' appellants br

it was not necessarily unreasonable for stone to continue to rely on the327_patents presumption of validity despite the327_patents inventor_testimony

2004 concluding in an appeal from a denial of a fee award that a partys decision to proceed with a lawsuit was not frivolous` in light of the statutory presumption of validity'

see inwood labs. inc. v. ives labs. inc. 456_u.s._844 856 102_s.ct._2182 72_l.ed.2d_606_(1982)` determining the weight and credibility of the evidence is the special province of the trier of fact`
we will not disturb its findings on appeal

in response to cooks contention that stones litigating_position was` not tenable' the district_court explained that perhaps most telling was the fact that following cooks service on [ stone ] of its invalidity_contentions it took no actions *1181 to ensure a rapid termination of the instant litigation.. [ including that it inter_alia ] did not 1 inform [ stone ] that it believed the lawsuit to be frivolous or unfounded ; [ or ] 2 demand that [ stone ] drop the lawsuit or indicate that the asserted claims wereclearly invalid
stone_basket_ii 2017_wl_2655612 at *4 emphasis added
on appeal cook faults the district_court for citing` no authority for the proposition that tactical decisions made by the prevailing party are relevant to an assessment of the strength of the non-prevailing partys litigating_positions'
appellants br

we disagree with cook

the district_court was well within its discretion to factor in cooks litigation conduct because` the conduct of the parties is a relevant factor under octanes totality-of-the-circumstances inquiry including the conduct of the movant'
gaymar indus. inc. v. cincinnati sub-zero prods. inc. 790_f.3d_1369 1373 fed
cir
2015 footnote omitted considering conduct of the movant in assessing exceptionality
such conduct includes cooks failure to send any communication to stone that highlighted and set out with precision the specific invalidity argument on which cook now relies for its assertion that stone should have known its conduct was` clearly unreasonable' appellants br
17 or` objectively baseless' id.at 25 so as to merit an award of attorney_fees

further cooks failure to provide early focused and supported notice of its belief that it was being subjected to exceptional litigation behavior further supports the district_courts determination that stones litigating_position did not` stand [ ] out' from others
octane 134 s.ct.at 1756
absent any evidence that stones litigating_position was frivolous when filed or at any point before it filed for dismissal we are not persuaded the district_court abused its discretion in determining stones case did not meet the standard for an award of attorney_fees

here litigation commenced in april 2015 j.a
29 and cook served its invalidity_contentions in october 2015 stone_basket_ii 2017_wl_2655612 at *2
the327_patent inventors testimony regarding the novelty of the sheath was taken in january 2016
j.a

the uspto instituted the ipr in september 2016 j.a
1690-91 at which time the litigation was stayed pending the iprs outcome see stone_basket_ii 2017_wl_2655612 at *3
at each of these points during the litigation we find nothing of record supporting cooks claim that stone was` on clear_notice' of the327_patents invalidity yet` persisted in pressing.. meritless claims'
appellants br
25 ; see id
( relying only upon evidence of service of invalidity_contentions and the inventor admissions as proof that stone knew at those points its claims were meritless

moreover a` party can not simply hide under a rock quietly documenting all the ways its been wronged so that it can march out itsparade of horribles after all is said and done'

cal
mar._30,_2018
we find this reasoning both persuasive and applicable to this case
cook waited until october 2016 nearly a year after service of its invalidity_contentions and nine months after the inventors statements regarding the sheaths novelty before informing stone that if stone refused to drop its case` cook intend [ ed ] to file.. a motion for attorneys fees against [ stone ] *1182 its principals and its attorneys'
j.a
1717
during oral argument counsel for cook could not explain why it did not make its assertion of frivolousness of the claims known to stone sooner
see oral arg.at 11:37-12:19 http //oralarguments.cafc.uscourts.gov/default.aspx ? fl=2017-2330.mp3 q` that [ october 2016 ] email is.. the kind of communication i am talking about that is it says.. that if you do n't accept our settlement then [ we will file for attorney_fees ]'
a` i recognize that..' q` its just that [ the september 2016 letter ] came very late.. and the proceedings ended.. six weeks later'
a` yes..' q` why did n't you send something like that [ september 2016 settlement email ] before ?'
a` i did n't think it would produce the result we were likely to see..' emphasis added

cook argues that the motion to transfer_venue meant any possible notification to stone while the case was before the eastern_district would not have resulted in the preferred result of dismissal
see id.at 5:51-6:05 stating by cooks counsel that he felt` neither the [ federal ] rule 11 [ of civil procedure ] nor the early summary judgment [ motion ] was going to give us an early exit' because of the` pending motion to transfer'
it does not matter that a procedural motion was pending in the eastern_district ; nothing prevented counsel for cook from notifying stones counsel that cook regarded stones litigating actions as frivolous and explaining precisely why
cooks counsel acknowledged as much
see id.at 11:30-33 stating by counsel for cook` maybe we could have written a letter'
nor did anything prevent cook from asking the eastern_district to expedite its ruling on the motion to transfer_venue
see fed
r. civ
p. 16 a

we are further unpersuaded by cooks counterargument that this case is similar to rothschild see appellants br
27 citing 858 f.3d at 1388 in which we reversed a district_courts denial of a ¡± 285 motion because the district_court failed to consider plaintiffs` willful_ignorance of the prior_art' given counsel for plaintiff admitted that counsel had` not conducted an analysis of any of the prior_art asserted in [ the cross-motion ] to form a belief as to whether that prior_art would invalidate' the patent
rothschild 858 f.3d at 1388
in rothschild the defendant also provided notice that the patent was invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡±¡± 101_and_102 and filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings
see id.at 1385-86
the defendant further served plaintiff with a rule 11 letter and appended both a draft rule 11 b motion and copies of anticipatory prior_art
id.at 1386
here by contrast cook failed to file any rule 11 motion or motions for summary judgment and has not set forth any concrete evidence that the district_court failed to consider stones evaluation of its case in light of the evidence of record

our holding with respect to this factor does not disturb the rule that` a party can not assert baseless infringement claims and must continually assess the soundness of pending infringement claims'

indeed by december 2016 stone moved to dismiss this litigation and after a hearing on the same the district_court dismissed with prejudice
see stone_basket_ii 2017_wl_2655612 at *3
on the particular facts of this case where there is no indication of willful_ignorance or failure to assess the *1183 soundness of pending claims by stone cooks post-judgment notice of its assertion that the claims were always baseless can not mandate an award of fees under a` totality of the circumstances' analysis
octane 134 s.ct.at 1756
accordingly the district_court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that stones litigating_position did not` stand [ ] out from others'

b
stones conduct in other litigation
in considering the` totality of the circumstances' in a ¡± 285 motion a partys similar conduct in other_litigation is also relevant
see id.at 1757
the district_court found a lack of evidence to support cooks assertion that stone sued cook like it had done other defendants` for the sole_purpose of forcing settlements without any intention of testing the merits of its claim'
stone_basket_ii 2017_wl_2655612 at *6 internal_quotation_marks and citation omitted

cook alleges the district_court improperly found that cook made` conclusory allegations' regarding stones alleged_pattern of` vexatious_litigation' solely` to extract a.. nuisance payment'

instead cook avers that its evidence of more than 400 cases filed by entities managed by stones managing members messrs._mitry and salmon demonstrates that stone is part of a larger plan to force nuisance_settlements constituting exceptional litigation conduct

here despite cooks table summarizing the extent of other mitry-salmon litigation the district_court did not abuse its discretion.2 the record lacks evidence that the number of settlements or type of settlement stone proposed rises to what we have previously considered exceptional

2011 affirming a finding of exceptionality based on discovery misconduct and eon-nets filing of over 100 lawsuits against` diverse defendants' where eon-net` followed each filing by a demand for a quick settlement at a price far lower than the cost to defend the litigation' which was demonstrated *1184 by evidence of pro-forma settlement offers based on a license fee schedule of a defendants annual sales
further we find no evidence of an immediate settlement demand in the instant case
instead stone litigated its position on the merits for nearly two years presenting claim construction arguments before the district_court and responses to the ipr petition before the ptab
as the supreme_court has cautioned fee awards are not to be used as a` penalty for failure to win a patent_infringement_suit'
octane 134 s.ct.at 1753 internal_quotation_marks and citation omitted
the district_court analyzed but ultimately found unpersuasive cooks arguments and we see no reason to upset the district_courts findings here

conclusion
we have considered cooks remaining arguments and find them unpersuasive
