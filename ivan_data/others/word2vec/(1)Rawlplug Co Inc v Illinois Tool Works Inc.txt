* opinion
plunkett district_judge
the rawlplug company` rawlplug' claims infringement of two of its patents by illinois_tool_works` itw' line of masonry_anchors manufactured and sold under the names of new_striker and hammer_loc
both the patents in suit and itws alleged infringing anchors relate to a single piece pre-shaped anchoring device for use in masonry

after a bench trial the district_court in a written opinion and order entered judgment in favor of the defendant itw and dismissed the complaint
rawlplug appeals claiming that the district_court erred in both interpreting the patent_claims and in limiting their scope
for the reasons that follow we reverse and remand

background
this patent dispute concerns certain anchors designed to secure fixtures such as roofing material to masonry surfaces
the appellant rawlplug manufactures and sells various fasteners including masonry_anchors for use in the construction industry
in the early 1980s rawlplugs vice-president for manufacturing and engineering louis giannuzzi conceived a design for a simple yet efficient masonry anchor
the design of this anchor can be generally described as consisting of a shank formed of resilient_material such as heat tempered steel which is shaped during manufacture to include at least one bend along its longitudinal_axis
this metal_shank has a memory such that when forcibly deformed-e.g. pounded into a hole-it seeks to recover its original bent shape
as it returns to this original_shape the anchor exerts outward_pressure on the walls of the *1038 hole into which it has been driven
rawlplugs patents on this device which are set out in detail below are the subject of this suit

through its buildex and ramset/redhead divisions appellee itw is also engaged in the manufacture and sale of masonry_anchors
itw manufactures two masonry_anchors under the tradenames` new_striker' and` hammer-loc'
for purposes of this litigation the parties have stipulated that these two anchors are essentially the same
hence we refer to them collectively under the title` new_striker'

rawlplug filed suit in the united_states_district_court for the southern_district of new york1 against itw arguing that itws new_striker anchor infringed two of rawlplugs patents specifically u.s. patent nos._4828,445` the445_patent` and 4,963,062` the062_patent`2 rawlplug sought damages for willful infringement
itw denied infringement

after a four-day bench trial the district_court concluded in a written opinion that the new_striker did not infringe the claims asserted by rawlplug either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents
rawlplug_co. v. illinois_tool_works 23_uspq2d_1054 1992_wl_91703_(s.d.n.y.1992)
rawlplug has appealed from this judgment

i
the patents in suit
in its suit against itw rawlplug charges that the itw_new_striker infringed claims 1-4 of the445_patent and claims 1-big_token__3_and_25__big_token of the062_patent
the language of the patents in suit is straightforward

a
the445_patent
claim 1 of patent445 is the focus of our attention for claims 2 3 and 4 are all dependent on claim 1 and add additional limitations not relevant to this appeal
claim 1 which is fully set forth in appendix i states the following:3

( a one piece pre-shaped anchor ; b containing at least one indentation in the shank ; c which indentation creates a bend resulting in a peak on one side of the shank and upper and lower_base on the other
this configuration can be described as arcuate i.e. bent or curved in the form of a bow ; d the anchors shank is of a constant diameter that is slightly less than the pre-drilled masonry_hole ; e the shank is made of a resilient_material whose` memory' is such that after it is driven into the masonry_hole it seeks to regain its original_shape
when the resilient shank seeks to regain its original_shape it creates an outward_pressure on at least three points-the peak and the two base points
in essence then claim 1 teaches that the pressure of driving the anchor into the masonry_hole tends to straighten the shank without damaging the hole and that after the shank has been driven its resiliency causes the anchor to regain its original_shape
the language of the445_patent also reveals that the claim is not limited in the number of undulations or bends
claim 1 requires` at least one undulation' or bend but the language covers an anchor with more
secondly the shank can not chisel its own original_shape into the pre-drilled masonry *1039 hole
if such occurs the memory of the shank is not actuated and the anchor will not hold

b
the062_patent
rawlplugs other patent in suit u.s. patent no._4963,062 is similar but adds various head configurations not germane to the present appeal
the062_patent does require that the resilient_material of the shank have a` non-abrading bearing surface' so that the anchor when hammered into the hole will not` score chisel or otherwise mutilate the hole'
claim 1 of this patent on which claims 2_and_3 depend reads in pertinent_part.. said masonry_being of a material which if scored chiseled or otherwise mutilated by the anchor would alter the shape of the hole_wall and thereby weaken the holding power of the anchor....... said shank being formed of resilient_material and having a non-abrading bearing surface so that when it is forcibly driven into said tightly fitting_hole it will not score chisel or otherwise mutilate the hole_wall and said undulation will be forcibly altered by reaction with the wall of the hole and in seeking to recover its original_shape will frictionally secure the anchor in place
( emphasis added
claim 25 like claim 1 contains this` non-abrading' language.big_token__4_claim_25__big_token however does not require that the anchor have at least one undulation

rawlplug manufactured a product called the` rawlplug_spike' in accordance with the disclosures of these two patents
the spike has enjoyed remarkable success in the industry as a substantial improvement over prior fastening methods

ii
the alleged infringing itw_new_striker
at trial itw never contested that it set out to engineer around the rawlplug_patents
a civil engineer at itw named nilsen purchased several rawlplug_spike anchors
after testing those anchors and reviewing the rawlplug_patents mr._nilsen designed the itw_anchors
mr._nilsens anchors were a pre-shaped with upper and lower_portions and a transition center portion with a bend ; b uniform in diameter throughout its length ; c made of heat-treated steel to give it a resiliency or spring temper
unlike the patents in suit the itw_anchors had unidirectional notches on the shank
these notches form serrations that extend above the surface of the anchor to the approximate thickness of a human_hair
this feature was designed to enhance the functional engagement between the shank and the cylindrical_wall of the pre-drilled masonry_hole
because these notches are very thin they abrade the masonry_wall only slightly
these notches apparently increase the holding or gripping strength of the anchor

more importantly however the itw_anchors when struck into masonry_holes function in a similar fashion as set forth in claim 1 in rawlplugs445_patent
the upper and lower_portions of the anchor above and below the center bend tend to straighten to conform to the masonry_hole
after insertion the anchor tends to regain its original_shape giving four points of pressure on the masonry_walls
because of the notches the forced insertion of the anchor tends to abrade the masonry_wall to a small degree

*1040 iii
the district court opinion
the district_court found that although itw knew of the rawlplug_patents and its rawlplug_spike and intended to design around them the itw_new_striker and hammer_loc_products did not literally infringe either the445_patent or the062_patent
first with respect to the445_patent the district_court focused on the patents requirement of an arcuate_bend
the court emphasized that the445_patent was awarded despite its similarities to japanese patent publication 55-122918 the` katou_patent' on the grounds that unlike the katou_anchor which has a linear offset shank giannuzzis application described an arcuate_bend
the district_court concluded that` arcuate' meant both shaped as a bow and having an upper and lower portion of the shank or bow that was in the same_line or axis
finding neither in the uninstalled_itw_products the court found no literal_infringement of either rawlplug_patent

second the court held that the062_patent had not been literally infringed by the new_striker because the new_strikers serrations preclude it from having the` non-abrading' surface described in claims 1_and_25 of the062_patent
the court specifically rejected rawlplugs claim that the term` non-abrading' could mean that the anchor might slightly abrade

finally the court found that the new_striker did not infringe either the445_patent or the062_patent under the doctrine of equivalents
it determined that the new_strikers holding power does not result from a three point_pressure_system centered around a peak and two bases but instead results from a combination of a four point_pressure_system and a mechanical interlock between the serrations and the masonry_wall

iv
appellants arguments
in its appeal rawlplug contends that the district_court erred as a matter of law in holding that itws anchors did not infringe claims 1-4 of rawlplugs445_patent and claims 1_and_25 of rawlplugs062_patent
it makes three arguments to this end
first it asserts that the trial_court erred when it interpreted the445_patent_claims as encompassing only those anchors whose holding power is derived solely from three points of frictional contact between the wall of the masonry_hole and the anchor and in which the levels of contact center around a single peak and two bases lying in the same_longitudinal_axis
in support of this argument rawlplug places particular emphasis on the phrase` at least one undulation' in claim 1 of the445_patent
rawlplug suggests that the district_court improperly relied on the commercial embodiment of the445_patent -which relies on three pressure points-rather than the claim_language in concluding that the patent required only one undulation in which the upper and lower axis of the bend must be in the same_longitudinal_axis

rawlplugs second argument is that the district_court erred as a matter of law by interpreting the062_patent term` non-abrading' as requiring zero abrasion
rawlplug argues that this term should be read in context with the other phrases in the claim and with reference to the patent history
ultimately rawlplug believes that the062_patent was literally infringed by the new_striker despite the new_strikers slightly abrasive quality

its third contention is that the court incorrectly limited the scope of the claims of both the445 and062_patent s based on a combination of elements selected from two unrelated prior_art patents-the katou and carroll_patents

discussion
as noted above the appellant is challenging the district_courts interpretation of its patents as a matter of law
we review the courts decision in this regard de novo since claim interpretation is an issue of law
intervet_america v. kee-vet_laboratories 887_f.2d_1050 1053 fed.cir.1989 ; mannesmann demag corp. v. engineered metal prod co. 793_f.2d_1279 1282 fed.cir.1986 ; envirotech_corp. v. al george inc. 730_f.2d_753 758 fed.cir.1984
we conclude that the district_court incorrectly interpreted the claims and thus clearly erred in finding no literal_infringement

*1041 as recognized by the district_court a determination of infringement requires a two-step process interpreting the claims of the patent and then a comparison of the properly interpreted claims with the accused device

intervet_america 887 f.2d at 1053

ii
literal_infringement the445_patent
an examination of itws new_striker reveals that its form is deceptively different before and after installation
for example the new_striker before installation appears to have only a single bend
there are offset notches on either side of the shank before the bend and the shank does not curve back after the bend to form the shape of a bow
the district_court apparently considered the shape before installation
yet the claims of the rawlplug445 or062_patent s are specifically crafted to claim an innovative device after installation
these claims clearly reflect that it is the fastening configuration in masonry that is protected
thus we look to the product as installed since the installed product is what is detailed in the claim and the claim_language is controlling

?
when installed the hammer_loc appears as follows

?
-- -- -

both of these exhibits were in evidence at trial and neither was controverted by itw
a careful examination reveals that each enters the predrilled masonry_hole on an angle
where that occurs it is clear that there are one or more undulations in the shank taking on an arcuate shape
in other words the itw_products when installed have undulations *1043 resulting in peaks and bases that are bow shaped
equally important the peaks and bases extend and rest against the wall of the masonry_hole creating the binding and fastening effect
finally the binding and holding strength is derived from a resilient_material in the shank that seeks after being driven into the masonry to regain its original_shape.5

apart from the clear language of the patent_claims we also consider the prosecution_history the prior_art and any expert testimony on the meaning of the claims

denied 484_u.s._1027 108_s.ct._751 98_l.ed.2d_764_(1988)
as indicated in the district_courts opinion rawlplug was required to distinguish its claims from those of the katou_patent before its patent issued
the district_court found that rawlplugs inventor was required to assert his anchor had a wavy undulation in contrast to the katou_anchor which had a straight offset portion,6 in order to obtain the445_patent
the offset portion of the katou_anchor had a straight form without a peak
the district_court was persuaded that the itw_anchors more closely resembled katou and were thus distinguishable from rawlplugs445_patent
we disagree
again the district_courts analysis was based on the itw_anchors before installation
after installation as discussed above the itw anchor which enters the masonry_hole at an angle clearly shows the undulations and arcuate_bend
itws own expert hasan testified to such

consequently the katou_patent is easily distinguishable both from the rawlplug_claims and itws infringing anchors
the anchor in katou has an angle_cut in the shank to create an area of overlap
as figure 6 of the katou_patent reproduced below demonstrates the anchor sits upright in the hole

?
above the overlap_area the shank contacts only one side of the wall ; below the overlap the shank contacts the other
in contrast itws anchor tilts and creates an undulating shank without an overlap_area or bulge
all of this was explained by rawlplugs expert witness holmes
the new_striker does not have a linear offset like katou but arcuate_bends that are the basis of the fastening strength of the anchor

the district_court also found that the rawlplug_patents were not literally infringed because the axis of the upper and lower *1044 portion of the itw_anchors were not in the same_line
we can find no support for imposing such a requirement on the445_patent in the record
no expert testified to such a requirement and more importantly the claim_language of the445 and062_patent s do not contain such a restriction
by including such a requirement the district_court improperly limited the scope of the rawlplug_patent_claims

we conclude that the district_court committed reversible_error in finding no literal_infringement of claim 1 of the445 rawlplug_patent by itws new_striker and hammer_loc_products
we reverse

iii
literal_infringement the062_patent
itw fares no better with the062_patent
as noted above the district_court determined that the serrations on the new_striker took that anchor out of the062_patent because that patent calls for a non-abrading shank
this court finds that a different result obtains when the term` non-abrading' is read in the context of the other_language of the patent and in light of the prior_art against which the non-abrasion language was added.7

claim 1 states in pertinent_part.. said shank being formed of resilient_material and having a non-abrading bearing surface so that when it is forcibly driven into said tightly fitting_hole it will not score chisel or otherwise mutilate the hole_wall and said undulation will be forcibly altered by reaction with the wall of the hole and in seeking to recover its original_shape will frictionally secure the anchor in place
( emphasis added
we read the phrase` so that it will not score chisel or otherwise mutilate the hole' as modifying and illuminating the term` non-abrading' in the context of the design of the shank
the phrase` frictionally secure' suggests that the anchor was to operate not only by the force of the shank pressing outward against the walls of the masonry_hole but also by the operation of friction between the shank and the walls
the inclusion of` frictionally' suggests that at least some minimal abrasion was contemplated but the qualifying language above that phrase indicates that the friction or abrasion would not be such as to score chisel or mutilate the hole
moreover we note that the claim states only that the anchor was to be non-abrading` when it is forcibly driven into said tightly fitting_hole' not that it will not abrade at all when finally in place

this last reading is consistent with the patents purpose as recited in the patent_specifications` background of invention' section
this section describes that one` serious drawback' of rawlplugs` rawl drive' anchor is the bulge created by the split and expanded half sections which has a` maximum transverse dimension which is necessarily significantly greater than the diameter of the hole drilled in the masonry'
because the bulge is significantly greater than the diameter of the hole` when the rawl drive anchor is driven into a hole driven in masonry it may score and mutilate this hole and thereby weaken the holding power of the anchor'
the summary of the advantages of the062_patent invention provides that` [ t ] he maximum cross-sectional dimension of the shank is not substantially greater than the diameter of the hole whereby when the shank is driven therein it will not chisel or otherwise mutilate the hole_wall'
this discussion suggests that the patent was designed to overcome the insertion abrasion that had been a problem with earlier devices
this discussion jibes with the statement in the claim that the anchor has` a non-abrading bearing surface so that when it is forcibly driven into said tightly fitting_hole it will not score chisel or otherwise mutilate the hole_wall'
the specification also provides that upon full insertion the anchor will have a` gripping action'
the reference to gripping is entirely consistent with the claim_language` will frictionally secure'
thus in a number of respects the patent_specification supports our interpretation of claim_language
see e.i
dupont_de_nemours & co. v. phillips_petroleum_co. 849_f.2d_1430 1433 fed.cir
(` it is entirely proper to use the specification to interpret what the patentee meant by a word or phrase in the *1045 claim
`` cert
denied 488_u.s._986 109_s.ct._542 102_l.ed.2d_572_(1988)

in its opinion the district_court correctly notes that giannuzzis application for this patent was rejected initially in light of prior_art namely u.s. patent no._1574,790 the` carroll_patent'
the carroll_patent was a design for a bow-shaped box handle to be used for a wooden battery box
the patent specifies that the handle be made of resilient_material and have teeth in the nature of pointed spurs on its surface
when the metal handle was driven into a hole in the wood it would straighten and then once wedged in the hole seek to recover its original_shape thus securing the handle through pressure and friction
this manipulation of the memory of the driven metal shape operated similarly to giannuzzis proposed anchor

unlike the anchor however the carroll_patent handle had metal teeth which would help secure the handle in place by digging into the sides of the wooden hole
giannuzzi argued to the patent_examiners that his anchor did not have such_teeth and indeed such_teeth would so severely abrade the walls of the masonry as to undermine the anchors effectiveness
to distinguish his application from the carroll_patent giannuzzi added inter alia the phrase` non-abrading.. bearing surface' and` will not score chisel or otherwise mutilate the hole_wall'
with this revision and other changes irrelevant here the application was granted and the patent issued

while the patent_examiners may have relied on the non-abrading surface to distinguish the062_patent from prior_art we must interpret that term consistently with the other_language in the claim
cf autogiro_co. v. united_states 384_f.2d_391 395-96 181_ct.cl._55_(1967) claims of the patent provide the concise formal definition of the invention and it is to these wordings that one must look to determine whether there has been infringement
as noted above we read the claim to provide that the anchor will not abrade the walls of the masonry_hole when it is forced therein to such an extent that the walls are scored chiseled or mutilated
we do not read the non-abrading language as the district_court did to preclude the exertion of some friction on the walls of the hole once the metal anchor has regained its original_shape
indeed we read it to require that some friction be exerted by the notation that the anchor will be` frictionally secure' in place

moreover we find that slight_abrasion on insertion is contemplated in the062 claim-for the anchor will be only slightly narrower than the hole into which it will be driven thus the phrase` tight fitting_hole' so that there will be a tight fit when the metal_shank regains its curved form
all that is precluded by the claim is abrasion that mutilates scores or chisels the hole on entry

consequently we find that the slight serrations found on the new_striker shank are not inconsistent with the claims of the062_patent
these serrations are located on the convex surface of the shank and extend above the surface of the shank to a maximum of five thousandths of an inch approximately the thickness of a human_hair
the purpose of these serrations is to improve the frictional_engagement between the shank and the cylindrical_wall of the hole
although according to itws expert mr. hasan there is some slight_abrasion when the new_striker is inserted the serrations do not score chisel or mutilate the masonry_hole
once in place these serrations increase the anchors holding power by enhancing its frictional_engagement
this abrasion is not inconsistent with the language of the062 claim that the shank` frictionally secure the anchor in place'
hence we conclude that the district_court clearly erred in finding that the new_striker did not literally infringe rawlplugs062_patent

accordingly we reverse and remand for further_proceedings in accordance with this opinion

reversed and remanded

appendix i
claim 1 of the445_patent reads as follows a one-piece pre-shaped anchor bolt driven axially into an untapped round hole drilled in masonry to hold a fixture or other object having a mounting hole therein against the surface of the masonry said mounting hole having a diameter substantially the same as that of the drilled hole *1046 said bolt comprising a drivable head and a shank integral therewith formed of resilient_material whose memory is such that when the shank is forcibly deformed it seeks to recover its original_shape said shank being pre-shaped to have at least one undulation which deviates from the longitudinal_axis passing through the head and shank to create an arcuate_bend therein having a peak which normally lies at a position well outside the periphery of the drilled hole and having and upper and a lower_base said shank having a cross section dimension which is substantially uniform throughout its length and is substantially equal to the diameter of the drilled hole to permit its undulation to snake through the mounting hole without the application of a driving force to the shank and to permit said shank to be driven axially into the drilled hole whereby when the shank is so driven this force acts to straighten out the bend to cause it to enter the drilled hole the resultant deformation of the bend exerting substantial_outward_pressure against the wall of the drilled hole at a first_level at which the peak contacts the wall of the drilled hole at one side thereof and at second and third_levels at which the upper and lower_bases contact the wall of the drilled hole on the other_side thereof which multi-level pressures exerted on the wall resist axial withdrawal of the shank from the drilled hole

appendix ii
claim 1 of the062_patent reads a pre-shaped anchor of a kind adapted to be forcibly driven axially into a tightly fitting_hole drilled in masonry so that the anchor makes a strong interference fit therein said anchor being adapted to support an object at a position adjacent said masonry said masonry_being of a material which if scored chiseled or otherwise mutilated by the anchor would alter the shape of the hole_wall and thereby weaken the holding power of the anchor said anchor comprising a drivable_element and an elongated shank extending from the element and terminating in a tip said shank being pre-shaped to have an end_portion furthest from the element which extends in the general direction of the longitudinal_axis passing through the element and said tip of the shank and to have at least one undulation between the element and said end_portion which creates a bend in the shank having a peak on one side of the shank between base portions generally on the other_side of said shank said shank being formed of resilient_material and having a non-abrading bearing surface so that when it is forcibly driven into said tightly fitting hold it will not score chisel or otherwise mutilate the hole_wall and said undulation will be forcibly altered by reaction with the wall of the hole and in seeking to recover its original_shape will frictionally secure the anchor in place

the pertinent_part of claim 1 reads.. said shank being pre-shaped to have at least one undulation which deviates from the longitudinal_axis passing through the head and shank to create an arcuate_bend therein having a peak which normally lies at a position well outside the periphery of the drilled hole and having an upper and lower_base...... said shank to be driven axially into the drilled hole whereby when the shank is so driven this force acts to straighten out the bend exerting substantial_outward_pressure against the wall of the drilled hole at a first_level at which the peak contacts the wall of the drilled hole at one side thereof and at a second and third_levels at which the upper and lower_bases contact the wall of the drilled hole on the other_side thereof.. 4
claim 25 of the062_patent reads in pertinent_part.. said masonry_being of a material which if scored chiseled or otherwise mutilated by the anchor would alter the shape of the hole_wall and thereby weaken the holding power of the anchor ; said anchor compromising a drivable_element and an elongated pre-shaped shank formed of resilient_material having a non-abrading bearing surface and having a cross-sectional dimension which at no point there-along substantially exceeds that of the drilled hole said pre-shaped shank having a first_portion extending from the first_portion and displaced from said longitudinal_axis so that when the shank is forcibly driven into said tightly fitting_hole it will not score chisel or otherwise mutilate the hole_wall and said second portion will be forcibly altered by reaction with the wall of the hole to bring it toward alignment with said longitudinal_axis and thereby frictionally secure the anchor in place
5
the difference between the itw_products and the rawlplug_patent_claims if there is one is that the arcuate_bend in the uninstalled_itw_products is not as clearly defined before installation
the undulation and peak become clear on installation because the itw_products position themselves within the hole on an angle
6
specifically the anchor in katou has an angle_cut in the shank to create an area of overlap
as figure 6 of the katou_patent graphically demonstrates the anchor sits straight up in the hole and does not tilt
this is the result of an overlap_area that forms the bulge with greater cross-sectional difference which the patent and trademark office used to distinguish over the rawlplug_claims
