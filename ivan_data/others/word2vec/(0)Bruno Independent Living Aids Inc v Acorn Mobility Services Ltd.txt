background
bruno manufactures and sells` stairlifts' which are devices that allow persons with mobility impairments to ascend and descend stairways on a chair that travels along a rail
in november 1991 bruno filed a patent_application at the united_states_patent and trademark office` pto' directed to a stairlift which issued as the405_patent in july 1993

in july 2002 bruno sued acorn a competitor alleging infringement of claims 5 9 10 and 15 of the405_patent
during discovery acorn produced numerous disclosures of prior_art_stairlifts that had not been considered by the patent examiner and thereafter moved for summary judgment of noninfringement and invalidity
admitting that the asserted claims were invalid in view of the prior_art identified by acorn bruno filed a reissue application at the pto the fate of which is immaterial to this appeal
in due course the district_court granted acorns motion for summary judgment,1 declaring claims 5 9 10 and 15 invalid
bruno_indep
living_aids inc. v. acorn mobility servs. ltd. 286_f.supp.2d_1020_(w.d.wis.2003)

subsequently acorn accused bruno of having intentionally withheld invalidating prior_art from the pto and asked the district_court to declare the case` exceptional' for the purpose of awarding attorney_fees under ¡± 285.2 acorn also requested additional_discovery to the extent the district_court required further evidence to justify a fee_award
upon briefing by both parties the district_court declared the case exceptional after determining that bruno had engaged in inequitable_conduct while prosecuting the405_patent and consequently denied acorns motion for additional_discovery

as the ground for its inequitable_conduct_determination the district_court found that bruno had failed to disclose to the pto_information on several_invalidating_prior_art_stairlifts that bruno had submitted to the food and drug administration` fda' in seeking approval to sell a stairlift covered by the405_patent
observing that the disclosure to the fda occurred concurrently with the prosecution of the405_patent the district_court-noting the absence of a credible good faith explanation from bruno for not disclosing *1351 the same information to the pto-inferred that the information had been withheld with deceptive_intent
the district_court thereupon concluded that bruno had engaged in inequitable_conduct which it deemed sufficient to render the case exceptional for the purpose of imposing a fee_award under ¡± 285
final judgment was entered in november 2003 in which bruno was ordered to pay acorn $ 399,459.32 in attorney_fees

on appeal bruno challenges the district_courts determination of an exceptional_case
in response acorn conditionally cross-appeals from the ruling denying additional_discovery on that issue
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

discussion
patent applicants3 owe a` duty of candor and good faith' to the pto
37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 a 2004 ; see also molins_plc v. textron inc. 48_f.3d_1172 1178 fed.cir.1995
a breach of this duty may constitute inequitable_conduct which can arise from a failure to disclose4 information material to patentability coupled with an intent to deceive or mislead the pto
molins 48 f.3d at 1178
materiality and intent must be established by clear and convincing evidence kingsdown med consultants ltd. v. hollister inc. 863_f.2d_867 872 fed.cir.1988 and then weighed` to determine whether the equities warrant a conclusion that inequitable_conduct occurred'
molins 48 f.3d at 1178
the ultimate determination of inequitable_conduct is therefore a matter` committed to the discretion of the trial court' and is reviewed for an abuse of discretion
kingsdown 863 f.2d at 876 en banc in relevant part
the underlying findings on materiality and intent are reviewed for clear error and will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of a` definite and firm conviction' that a mistake has been made
id.at 872

a
knowledge of prior art
in its inequitable_conduct_determination the district_court found that bruno deliberately withheld from the pto_information on several_invalidating_prior_art_stairlifts focusing its analysis on the` wecolator' manufactured by the cheney company among others.5 while conceding awareness of the wecolators existence during prosecution bruno contends that a duty to disclose did not arise because it had failed to appreciate the wecolators materiality at that time

we see no error in the district_courts treatment of the wecolator as prior *1352 art that was subject to the duty of disclosure
the record supports the district_courts finding that bruno possessed actual knowledge of the wecolator-and that it knew or should have known of its materiality
in an april_20,_1992 letter to the fda bruno sought approval to sell its sre-1500_stairlift which was an embodiment covered by the then-pending application that matured into the405_patent
( j.a
2198
in a paragraph labeled` substantial equivalence' in the fda_letter william_belson brunos director of engineering claimed that the sre-1500_stairlift was` similar in design and function' to the units manufactured by` cheney manufacturing inc.' id
product information on the` weckalator' [ sic ] was listed as an enclosure with the fda_letter
( j.a
2199

bruno argues that its claim of` substantial equivalence' between the sre-1500_stairlift and the wecolator was relevant only for the purpose of securing fda approval and that it had no bearing on whether bruno knew the wecolator to be material_prior_art for purposes of patentability
this distinction is disingenuous in light of what the record reflects the fda submission was prepared by william_belson who was also involved in the prosecution of the405_patent and had asked brunos patent attorney to conduct a prior_art_search in preparation for filing the patent_application
( j.a
2859-61
more importantly brunos distinction is not persuasive because` an applicant who knew of the art or information can not intentionally avoid learning of its materiality.. it may be found that the applicantshould have known of that materiality'
fmc corp. v. manitowoc co. 835_f.2d_1411 1415 fed.cir.1987 footnote omitted
accordingly we are not persuaded that the district_court clearly erred in charging bruno with knowledge of the wecolators materiality

b. materiality
regardless whether it knew the wecolator to be invalidating prior_art bruno argues that the wecolator is simply not material but rather is cumulative to the information submitted to the pto such that its nondisclosure can not provide a ground for finding inequitable_conduct
we do not agree

in evaluating materiality we have consistently referred to the definition provided in 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 by which the pto has promulgated the duty of disclosure
see e.g. critikon inc. v. becton dickinson vascular access inc. 120_f.3d_1253 1257 fed.cir.1997 discussing the version of the rule in effect since 1992 ; j.p. stevens & co. v. lex tex ltd. 747_f.2d_1553 1559 fed.cir.1984 applying the pre-1992 version of the rule
in 1992 the definition of materiality in 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 was revised
as defined in the current version of the rule information is material to patentability when [ i ] t is not cumulative to information already of record or being made of record in the application and
( 1 it establishes by itself or in combination with other information a prima facie case of unpatentability of a claim ; or
( 2 it refutes or is inconsistent with a position the applicant takes in i opposing an argument of unpatentability relied on by the office or
( ii asserting an argument of patentability
37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 b 2004 emphases added
according to the ptos notice of final rulemaking the rule change applied to all applications pending or filed after march_16,_1992
duty of disclosure 57 fed
reg
2021 jan._17,_1992
thus the new rule was applicable during the prosecution of the405_patent and we evaluate the materiality *1353 of the wecolator under the standard set forth in the applicable amended rule
in doing so we give deference to the ptos formulation at the time an application is being prosecuted before an examiner of the standard of conduct it expects to be followed in proceedings in the office
in light of this definition we discern no error in the district_courts finding of materiality based on its assessment that the disclosure of the wecolator to the pto would have precluded bruno from advancing certain arguments in favor of patentability

specifically the prosecution history shows that bruno amended the claim that eventually issued as claim 15` to more clearly define the novel and nonobvious attributes' j.a
911 by adding a limitation that required the stairlifts swivel seat to have an off-center_pivot that was proximate to the front_edge of the seat
( j.a
906
claim 15 as issued reads as follows a chairlift device comprising a a rail ; b a carriage_unit housing motor means operatively engaging said rail said carriage_unit moving between first and second terminal positions on said rail ; c a seat_assembly mounted to said carriage_unit said seat_assembly comprising i a seat_bracket having a front_edge and a rear_edge a backrest being mounted at said rear_edge of said bracket ; ii a swivel_tube fixed to the bottom of said seat_bracket proximate to said front_edge of said bracket ; iii a swivel mounting bracket fixed to the top of said carriage_unit and mounted to said carriage_unit proximate to the front of said carriage_unit ; iv means for selectively locking said seat_assembly in a preselected position ; wherein said swivel_tube coaxially fits within said swivel mounting bracket and further wherein said swivel_tube is free to rotate axially within said swivel mounting bracket
'405_patent col._11,_l._22 through col._12,_l._15 emphases added
in patentably distinguishing the amended claim over the prior_art bruno argued to the pto that claim [ 15 ] now calls for the swivel_tube and mounting bracket to be mounted proximate to the front_edge of the carriage_unit and seat_assembly
this feature provides several advantages neither taught nor suggested by the references cited by the examiner
... [ h ] aving a front offset pivot point for the seat allows the rail and other components of the chairlift to be mounted closer to the wall of the stairway than seats having center_pivot points as shown in the prior_art
( j.a
911-12

had the examiner known about the wecolator however bruno could not have touted the front offset swivel as a point of novelty
according to the deposition testimony of robert bartelt the sole named inventor on the405_patent the wecolator had an optional seat_assembly with an off-center swivel that provided similar advantages over the prior_art seats having center_pivots
( j.a
2532-33
the wecolator therefore satisfies the criteria for materiality specified in 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 b 2 ii
nevertheless bruno insists that the wecolator was cumulative to the prior_art of record in view of its submission of united_states_patent 4,913,264` voves' to the pto
we disagree ; unlike the wecolator the stairlift disclosed in voves does not have a seat_assembly with an offset swivel but rather one that *1354 has a center_pivot
thus on the evidence presented we do not consider the district_courts finding of materiality to be clearly erroneous

c. intent
finally bruno ascribes error to the district_courts reliance on so-called` negative inferences' to support its finding that bruno acted with deceptive_intent in failing to disclose the wecolator to the pto
bruno also accuses the district_court of misstating facts and according insufficient weight to certain evidence

based on our review of the record these contentions do not warrant reversal
while the district_court indeed provided little explicit support for its finding of intent it is well established that as an appellate tribunal we review judgments not opinions
see black v. cutter labs. 351_u.s._292 297 76_s.ct._824 100_l.ed._1188_(1956) ; stratoflex inc. v. aeroquip corp. 713_f.2d_1530 1540 fed.cir.1983
we therefore focus our review on whether there is sufficient_evidence in the record to sustain the judgment of intent to deceive the pto
consol aluminum corp. v. foseco int l ltd. 910_f.2d_804 814 fed.cir.1990` an appellate court need not close its eyes to the record where.. there is a way clearly open to affirm the district_courts action`
in the present case we find sufficient_evidence based upon which a fair inference of deceptive_intent may be drawn in view of the high_materiality of the wecolator
see brasseler u.s.a
i l.p. v. stryker sales corp. 267_f.3d_1370 1381 fed.cir.2001` when balanced against high_materiality the showing of intent can be proportionally less
``

`` intent need not and rarely can be proven by direct evidence'
merck & co. inc. v. danbury pharmacal inc. 873_f.2d_1418 1422 fed.cir.1989
rather in the absence of a credible_explanation intent to deceive is generally inferred from the facts and circumstances surrounding a knowing failure to disclose material_information
see paragon podiatry lab. inc. v. klm labs inc. 984_f.2d_1182 1193 fed.cir.1993
the particular facts and circumstances of the present case correspond in all relevant aspects to those cases in which we have upheld inferential findings of deceptive_intent on similar key evidence
see e.g. labounty mfg. inc. v. united states int l trade comm n 958_f.2d_1066 1076 fed.cir.1992 ruling that inference of deceptive_intent was supported by evidence of applicant making patentability arguments that could not have been made had the withheld prior_art been disclosed ; merck 873 f.2d at 1420-22 ruling that inference of deceptive_intent was supported by` damning' evidence that included applicant having submitted material_information to the fda while simultaneously withholding it from the pto and attempting to explain the disparity of its fda and pto_submissions in a way that` strains credulity'
the fact that an official of bruno who was involved in both the fda and pto_submissions chose to disclose the wecolator to the fda but not to the pto certainly supports a finding of deceptive_intent to withhold the disclosure from the pto

more importantly bruno has not proffered a credible_explanation for the nondisclosure and an inference of deceptive_intent may fairly be drawn in the absence of such an explanation
cf
dayco prods. inc. v. total containment inc. 329_f.3d_1358 1367 fed.cir.2003` intent to deceive can not be inferred simply from the decision to withhold the reference where the reasons given for the withholding are plausible`
normally it can be expected that an innocent party will be motivated to try to present convincing reasons for its actions or inaction
that did not occur here
accordingly we can not *1355 assign clear error to the district_courts inferential finding that bruno intentionally withheld the wecolator prior_art in an attempt to mislead the pto

because the district_courts findings on materiality and intent were not clearly erroneous there was no abuse of discretion in its determination that bruno procured the405_patent through inequitable_conduct
because inequitable_conduct can be one of several bases sufficient to make a case exceptional for the purpose of awarding attorney_fees under ¡± 285 see a.b
chance co. v. rte corp. 854_f.2d_1307 1312 fed.cir.1988 we do not find reversible error in the determination of an exceptional_case

we have considered the parties other arguments and conclude that they are either unpersuasive or unnecessary for resolution of this appeal

conclusion
for the foregoing reasons we conclude that the district_court did not err in its determination of an exceptional_case based on its determination that bruno committed inequitable_conduct
acorns cross-appeal for additional_discovery has been accordingly rendered moot

because brunos appeal was not frivolous we deny acorns motion for an award of double costs and attorney_fees under fed
