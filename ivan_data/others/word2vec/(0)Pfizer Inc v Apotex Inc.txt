opinion
michel chief_judge pfizer_inc. filed suit against apotex inc. formerly known as torpharm inc. in the united_states_district_court for the northern_district of illinois on july_30,_2003 alleging that pursuant to 21 u.s.c.¡± 355 j 5 b iii apotexs filing with the united_states food and drug administration` fda' of its abbreviated new drug application` anda' no._76-719 seeking approval to commercially sell amlodipine_besylate_tablets 2.5 mg 5 mg and 10 mg strengths before the expiration of the term of u.s._patent_no._4879,303` the ¡¬303_patent` to pfizer infringed claims 1-3 of the ¡¬303_patent
the anda_product sought to be approved by apotex is a generic_version of pfizers amlodipine_besylate drug product which is commercially sold in tablet_form in the united_states under the trademark norvascthe_r
norvascthe_r is approved by the fda for treating hypertension and chronic stable and vasospastic angina
the ¡¬303_patent entitled` pharmaceutically acceptable salts' is listed in the fdas approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations` orange book' with respect to the norvascthe_r drug product in accordance with 21 u.s.c.¡± 355 b 1
apotex certified in anda_no._76-719 that it believed the ¡¬303_patent was invalid and unenforceable and sought approval to market and sell its amlodipine_besylate_tablets before september 25 2007 i.e. the expiration date of the ¡¬303_patent plus an additional six months of pediatric exclusivity pursuant to 21 c.f.r.¡± 314.94 a 12 i a 4

in its answer to pfizers complaint apotex denied infringement and counterclaimed for declaratory_judgments that the claims of the ¡¬303_patent are invalid for anticipation and obviousness and that the ¡¬303_patent is unenforceable due to pfizers alleged inequitable_conduct before the united_states patent and trademark office` uspto'
prior to trial however apotex stipulated that its anda_product contains each limitation of claims 1-3 of the ¡¬303_patent and that if the ¡¬303_patent were upheld as valid and enforceable its anda_product would literally infringe those claims

following a bench_trial the district_court entered a final_judgment on january 29 2006 for pfizer and against apotex on apotexs request for declaratory_judgments that the claims of the ¡¬303_patent are invalid or unenforceable
based on the stipulation the trial_court found infringement
the district_court then ordered that the effective_date of any approval of apotexs anda_no._76-719 shall not be earlier than september 25 2007 and enjoined apotex from making using offering to sell selling or importing into the united_states any product comprising amlodipine_besylate covered by or the use of which is covered by the claims of the ¡¬303_patent until september 25 2007
pfizer_inc. v. apotex inc. no._03_c 5289 n.d.ill
jan._29,_2006

pfizer dismissed its claim of willful infringement against apotex by a stipulation and order dated january 23 2006
apotex now appeals from the district_courts final_judgment challenging the rulings as to validity and enforceability
because the district_court erred in holding that the subject_matter of claims 1-3 of the ¡¬ *1353 303 patent would not have been obvious we reverse
we therefore do not address apotexs assertion that it had proven that pfizer engaged in inequitable_conduct before the uspto during prosecution of the ¡¬303_patent

i
background
a. norvascthe_r contains amlodipine_besylate
the active_ingredient found in norvascthe_r is 2- [ 2 -aminoethoxy methyl ] -4- 2-chlorophenyl -3-ethoxycarbonyl-5-methoxycarbonyl-6-methyl-1,4-dihydropyridine commonly referred to as amlodipine
amlodipine is a member of a class of compounds referred to as dihydropyridines
active drug molecules such as amlodipine are frequently made into pharmaceutically-acceptable_acid_addition_salts to improve their bioavailability
amlodipine besylate1 is an acid_addition_salt_form of amlodipine formed from the reaction of amlodipine a weak base and benzene_sulphonic_acid

pfizers discovery_chemistry_group located in sandwich england invented amlodipine and discovered its anti-hypertensive and anti-ischemic pharmacological properties prior to 1982
pfizer filed a patent_application in the united kingdom on march_11,_1982 specifically claiming amlodipine
a u.s. counterpart application claiming priority from the u.k._application issued as u.s._patent_no._4572,909` the ¡¬909_patent` on february 25 1986.2 the ¡¬909_patent claims certain dihydropyridine compounds and their pharmaceutically-acceptable_acid_addition_salts
the ¡¬909_patent discloses that the pharmaceutically-acceptable_acid_addition_salts of amlodipine` are those formed from acids which form non-toxic acid_addition_salts containing pharmaceutically acceptable_anions such as hydrochloride hydrobromide sulphate phosphate or acid_phosphate acetate maleate fumarate lactate tartrate citrate and gluconate salts' and that the preferred salt is maleate.3 ¡¬909_patent col.2 ll.3-10

meanwhile on or about july_14,_1982 the discovery_chemistry_group recommended that amlodipine be developed as a commercial_drug_product
by this time pfizer had made several acid_addition_salts of amlodipine including the maleate fumarate salicylate hydrochloride and methane sulphonate forms
the discovery_chemistry_group designated amlodipine_maleate as the drug_substance for development

on or about august 11 1982 the project of formulating a commercial_drug_product was assigned to dr. james wells a manager in pfizers pharmaceutical_research and development_department who was assisted by mr. edward davison a member of the same group
by april_24,_1984 dr._wells identified a formulation for amlodipine_maleate that produced` excellent capsules'
in attempting to produce a direct compression tablet product of an amlodipine_maleate_formulation however dr._wells encountered two problems 1 *1354 chemical instability of the amlodipine_maleate and 2 stickiness of the tablet blend of amlodipine_maleate
chemical stability refers to the resistance of a drug compound to chemical breakdown while stickiness refers to the adherence of the drug_substance in formulation to manufacturing equipment such as the punch faces of a tablet-making press

to solve the problems of the tablet_form of amlodipine_maleate dr._wells suggested that other_amlodipine_salts be made and tested
in a memo dated april_24,_1984 dr._wells acknowledged the difficulty in stickiness and stability he was experiencing in attempting to make a tablet_formulation of amlodipine_maleate and stated that by changing from the maleate_salt to the free_base of amlodipine or another acid_addition_salt` many of the stability problems would disappear'
dr._wells identified six alternative_anions i.e. hydrochloride methane sulphonate benzene_sulphonate lactate succinate and acetate as potential anions with which to create acid_addition_salt_forms of amlodipine
he also eventually added the tosylate anion to this group
dr._wells testified at trial that he selected these candidates based on their differing structures and properties but could not explain why three of the seven alternative_anions were members of the same class of sulphonic_acids

mr._davison testified at trial that he tested these amlodipine_acid_addition_salt_forms as well as amlodipine_maleate and the free_base for solubility ph hygroscopicity and stickiness
another researcher dr. robin platt an analytical chemist at sandwich was brought in to test the stability of the amlodipine_acid_addition_salts
dr._platt subjected the maleate acetate succinate besylate mesylate and eventually the tosylate salicylate and hydrochloride salt_forms of amlodipine to thin-layer chromatography to determine the number and amount of degradants found in the various amlodipine_salts and compiled a ranking thereof based upon the stability of each salt_formulation

dr._platts findings were communicated to dr._wells via memorandum on or about october 9 1984 wherein dr._platt reported that the besylate_salt` showed a much improved stability profile over the maleate in all cases'
on october 11 1984 dr._wells recommended via memorandum to dr. j.r. davidson a deputy of pfizers pharmaceutical_research and development_department that the amlodipine_maleate_salt be replaced with amlodipine_besylate for the commercial amlodipine tablet product based on dr._platts memo and mr._davisons test results

by april_30,_1985 both amlodipine_maleate and amlodipine_besylate were undergoing human testing in clinical trials
pfizer scientists predicted that the capsule_form of amlodipine_maleate would have a shelf life of three years but that` poor stability of amlodipine_maleate_tablet_formulations' precluded commercialization
on the other hand the scientists noted that amlodipine_besylate tablet_formulations exhibited` clear superiority' in their processing characteristics particularly non-stickiness and in stability
capsule formulations of amlodipine_besylate had not yet been produced but work on this project was` expected to be straightforward'

on april_4,_1986 pfizer filed a patent_application to amlodipine_besylate in the u.k. which eventually issued as u.k. patent no._160833
on may_5,_1986 pfizer submitted a supplement to the fda stating that the dosage form anticipated for commercial use would be a tablet of amlodipine_besylate and that all future clinical trials with amlodipine would use this new formulation
in the supplement *1355 pfizer stated` we feel that the change in salt_form is justified since benzenesulfonate is a commercially acceptable_salt as exemplified by the tranquilizer_mesoridazine serentil'
in support of the use of the besylate_salt_form of amlodipine pfizer submitted a summary of the acute oral toxicity of amlodipine_besylate and amlodipine_maleate in rats and a comparison of the effects of both the besylate and maleate forms on blood pressure and heart rate of dogs
pfizer stated that the results showed that there was no quantitative difference in efficacy between equivalent doses of amlodipine_besylate_tablets or capsules and amlodipine_maleate capsules
in addition pfizer submitted a pharmacokinetic report and interim clinical summary showing that amlodipine_besylate_tablets and amlodipine_maleate capsules were bioequivalent and had comparable safety and toleration when administered to healthy human volunteers

on march_25,_1987 pfizer filed a u.s. application serial no._07 /030,658 to amlodipine_besylate claiming priority from the u.k._application
during prosecution the examiner initially rejected all claims of the application as obvious over the ¡¬909_patent in view of u.s._patent 4,032,637 to spiegel 1977` spiegel' and u.s._patent 3,816,612 to schmidt 1974` schmidt'
the examiner noted that schmidt discloses that aryl sulphonic acid salts which include besylate are superior to the preferred maleate of the909_patent while spiegel provides an example of a pharmaceutical_compound wherein the besylate form is specifically identified as the preferred_embodiment
in response to the rejection pfizer argued that the besylate_salt while not the most soluble salt has many other advantages not possessed by other acid_addition_salts.. [ i ] n addition to having good_solubility [ the besylate_salt ] is unique in imparting to the product good stability nonhygroscopicity and good processability
for one salt to have all of these outstanding features is not suggested or taught in the art and would require extensive experimentation to find
the examiner however maintained the rejection stating that` these qualities are basic considerations by a person skilled in the art for selecting a suitable pharmaceutical salt' as evidenced by berge` pharmaceutical salts' j. pharm
sci. 66 11-19 jan.1977` berge'
table 1 of berge shows 53 fda-approved commercially marketed anions including benzene_sulphonate that are useful for making pharmaceutically-acceptable_salts and lists the relative frequency of which each was used as a percentage based on the total number of anions or cations in use through 1974
berge discloses that benzene_sulphonate had a frequency of use of 0.25 %

in response to a final obviousness rejection by the examiner pfizer filed a continuation_application serial no._07 /256,938 and abandoned the original application
along with the continuation_application pfizer submitted a preliminary amendment and statement and a declaration under 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.132 by dr._wells dated october 3 1988` wells_declaration'
in the statement pfizer argued that the wells_declaration demonstrated that the besylate_salt of amlodipine possessed` all the desired characteristics necessary for a medicinal agent' and that it would not have been obvious` that only the besylate_salt of amlodipine would have all the necessary properties for a commercial_product'
pfizer argued that choosing an appropriate salt is a very difficult task` since each salt imparts unique properties to the parent_compound' and that one skilled in the art would` conclude that the besylate_salt of amlodipine is a unique compound and not *1356 an obvious one'
the wells_declaration stated that the besylate_salt of amlodipine was` found to possess a highly desirable combination of physicochemical_properties' including good_solubility stability non-hygroscopicity and processability which properties are` unpredictable both individually and collectively'

the continuation_application was allowed and issued as the ¡¬303_patent on november 7 1989
the first three claims of the ¡¬303_patent are reproduced here 1
the besylate_salt of amlodipine
2
a pharmaceutical_composition comprising an anti hypertensive antiischaemic or angina-alleviating effective_amount of the besylate_salt of amlodipine as claimed in claim 1 together with a pharmaceutically-acceptable diluent or carrier
3
a tablet_formulation comprising an anti-hypertensive antiischaemic or angina-alleviating effective_amount of the besylate_salt of amlodipine as claimed in claim 1 in admixture with excipients

norvascthe_r was launched as a commercial_product by pfizer in the u.s. in november 1992

b
from january 11 2006 to january 18 2006 the district_court conducted a bench_trial on the issues of 1 whether the claims of the ¡¬303_patent were anticipated by the disclosure of the ¡¬909_patent 2 whether the ¡¬303_patent was invalid for obviousness and 3 whether the claims of the ¡¬303_patent were unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct before the uspto
on january 18 2006 the district_court stated its findings and conclusions pursuant to fed.r.civ.p
52 a orally in open court
bench_order tr
1-28 january 18 2006
the district_court concluded that apotex failed to meet its burden of proving invalidity or inequitable_conduct by clear and convincing_evidence

the district_court first addressed the issue of invalidity by anticipation finding that while the ¡¬909_patent claims a genus of pharmaceutically-acceptable_salts of amlodipine that encompasses amlodipine_besylate the ¡¬ 909 patent does not as a matter of law disclose it
the district_court held that since the ¡¬909_patent does not list the species of a salt made from benzene_sulphonate it does not anticipate the claims of the ¡¬303_patent

with regard to obviousness the district_court rejected apotexs argument that the ¡¬909_patent in view of the berge_article and other_prior_art rendered the invention of the claims of the ¡¬303_patent obvious
the district_court first found that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have a bachelors degree in pharmaceutical science or analytical chemistry and some experience in drugs and drug preparation
the district_court concluded that the berge_article does not direct the skilled_artisan to create the besylate_salt of amlodipine because berge discloses that benzene_sulphonate was used only at a frequency of 0.25 % or 1 out of every 400 drugs prior to 1974
the district_court noted that the examiner must have considered the berge_article since it was cited in the ¡¬303_patent yet the examiner ultimately determined that the claims of the ¡¬303_patent were not obvious in view of this reference.4 further the district_court *1357 stated that there would be no expectation of success in making a besylate_salt of amlodipine because as berge teaches and expert testimony on both sides accepted` there is no reliable_way of predicting the influence of a particular_salt_species on the behavior of a parent_compound'
bench_order tr
23:3-6

the district_court also stated that the besylate_salt of amlodipine was unexpectedly superior to the amlodipine_salts of the prior_art
specifically the district_court stated that while amlodipine_besylate was not superior to amlodipine_maleate` in every category' it nonetheless` clearly and unexpectedly illustrates a superior_combination of properties when compared to what was suggested in the preferred preparation' -ostensibly the amlodipine_maleate disclosed as the preferred_embodiment of the ¡¬909_patent
these properties included good_solubility stability non-hygroscopicity and processability non-stickiness
the district_court found that amlodipine_besylate exhibited at least a solubility exceeding 1.0 mg/ml which the court stated is the desirable solubility factor for a commercial_product and that the ¡¬303_patent listed the besylate_salt_form of amlodipine as the most stable salt_form out of eight salts tested with the maleate_salt_form being sixth on the list

the district_court also rejected apotexs argument that amlodipine_besylate is actually hygroscopic rather than non-hygroscopic as disclosed in the ¡¬303_patent
apotex asserted that amlodipine_besylate attracts water because it 1 can exist as a hydrate 2 may have water within its crystalline structure and 3 can have water on its surface at extended temperatures and humidity
the district_court stated that while each of these facts is true each was entirely unenlightening because hygroscopicity per se was not a critical factor
instead the district_court emphasized that the maleate_salt of amlodipine underwent a michael_addition_reaction when exposed to water creating at least ten degradation_products making amlodipine_maleate unsuitable at least in tablet_form for medicinal purposes whereas the amlodipine_besylate did not undergo the same reaction
lastly the district_court found that pfizer conducted extensive tests for processability of the amlodipine_besylate by manufacturing tablets on conventional tablet-making machinery and measuring the amount of product sticking to the punch face after each manufacturing run
the district_court concluded that the tests showed that amlodipine_besylate was sufficiently non-sticky so as to be commercially processable and less sticky than the maleate form

besides evidence of superiority provided in the ¡¬303_patent itself the district_court pointed to another` objective_consideration' in determining that amlodipine_besylate was not obvious over the prior_art` pfizer would not have changed from the maleate into which it had invested both time and research_dollars to seek out a very strange and rare_besylate_salt absent an extremely good_reason'
bench_order tr
23:16-21
for all these reasons the district_court held that the claims of the ¡¬303_patent were not proven invalid for obviousness

next the district_court rejected apotexs claim that pfizer engaged in inequitable_conduct before the uspto in violation of its duty of candor and 37 c.f.r ¡± 1.56
apotex argued that pfizer made *1358 several material misrepresentations to the uspto during prosecution of the application leading to the ¡¬303_patent including misrepresenting the solubility stability and hygroscopicity of amlodipine_besylate and misrepresenting the number of tablets tested for processability both in the patent_application and in the wells_declaration
specifically apotex asserted that pfizer 1 fraudulently identified the solubility of amlodipine_besylate in its application for patent as 4.6 mg/ml where internal_pfizer_documents show the solubility to actually be 3.5 mg/ml ; 2 fraudulently claimed in the application to have tested over a thousand tablets for stickiness where internal_pfizer_documents show varying numbers up to only 150 tablets were actually tested ; and 3 fraudulently ranked the respective stabilities of the various salt_forms of amlodipine in an ordinal-rather than quantitative-fashion so as to conceal from the uspto that the stability differences between the besylate tosylate and mesylate salt_forms of amlodipine were actually very minor

the district_court first determined that none of these alleged misrepresentations were either material or false
in this regard the court stated that whether the solubility of amlodipine_besylate is 4.6 mg/ml as identified in the ¡¬303_patent or 3.5 mg/ml as identified in internal_pfizer_documents was at most a minor discrepancy given that any solubility over the critical 1.0 mg/ml level was sufficient solubility to meet the standards of a drug company seeking to produce a commercial drug
as for stability the district_court found that amlodipine_besylate was far more stable than amlodipine_maleate which as described above undergoes the undesirable michael_addition_reaction
second the district_court held that apotex failed to show intent to deceive by clear and convincing_evidence
indeed the court found` precious little evidence at all' showing an intent to deceive stating that` [ w ] hile it is clear that pfizer was eager to extend the patent life of its amlodipine compound such a desire does not rise to the level of fraudulent conduct'
bench_order tr
25:24-26:1

on january 29 2006 the district_court entered a final_judgment in favor of pfizer and against apotex on pfizers claim of infringement as well as on apotexs counterclaims alleging and seeking declarations of invalidity and unenforceability of the ¡¬303_patent
the district_court also ordered that pursuant to 35 u.s.c.¡± 271 e 4 a the effective_date of any approval of apotexs anda_no._76-719 shall not be earlier than september 25 2007 and pursuant to 35 u.s.c.¡± 271 e 4 b enjoined apotex its officers agents servants employees and attorneys and those persons in active concert or participation with it from engaging in the manufacture use offer for sale or sale within the u.s. or importation into the u.s. of any product comprising amlodipine_besylate covered by or the use of which is covered by the claims of the ¡¬303_patent until september 25 2007
pfizer_inc. v. apotex inc. no._03_c 5289 n.d.ill
jan._29,_2006
on february 17 2006 apotex filed a timely notice of appeal
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

ii
discussion
a. apotex appeals the district_courts final_judgment that it failed to prove by clear and convincing_evidence that the invention of claims 1-3 of the ¡¬303_patent would have been obvious and are therefore invalid and the district_courts finding that apotex failed to prove pfizer committed inequitable_conduct before the uspto
because the district_court erred in holding non- *1359 obvious the invention of claims 1-3 of the ¡¬303_patent we reverse the district_courts judgment
since we hold that claims 1-3 are invalid for obviousness we need not and do not address apotexs assertion that pfizer engaged in inequitable_conduct before the uspto during prosecution of the ¡¬ 303 patent

on appeal from a bench_trial this court reviews the trial_courts conclusions of law de novo and findings of fact for clear_error
golden blount inc. v. robert h. peterson co. 365_f.3d_1054 1058 fed.cir.2004
the ultimate_conclusion of whether a claimed invention would have been obvious is a question of law reviewed de novo based on underlying findings of fact reviewed for clear_error
richardson-vicks inc. v. upjohn co. 122_f.3d_1476 1479 fed.cir.1997
a factual_finding is clearly erroneous if despite some supporting evidence` the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed'
united_states v. u.s. gypsum co. 333_u.s._364 395 68_s.ct._525 92_l.ed._746_(1948)

b
the district_court held that apotex had established a prima_facie_case of obviousness because the patent_examiner initially rejected the claims to amlodipine_besylate for obviousness
specifically the district_court stated` the ¡¬303_patents file wrapper shows that the examiner originally rejected the claimed invention because of obviousness
under these circumstances of course the court must accept that the defendant has made a prima_facie showing on this question'
bench_order tr
21:20-24
the district_courts ruling must be rejected not only because it is legally incorrect but also because it may reflect a serious misconception regarding the proper burden of proof each party bears in a patent litigation

our case_law consistently provides that a court is never bound by an examiners finding in an ex parte patent_application proceeding
fromson v. advance offset plate inc. 755_f.2d_1549 1555 fed.cir.1985
thus it can never be the case that an examiners interim finding of prima_facie obviousness renders the claims of an issued patent prima_facie obvious
instead deference to the decisions of the uspto takes the form of the presumption of validity under 35 u.s.c.¡± 282
purdue pharma l.p. v. faulding inc. 230_f.3d_1320 1329 fed.cir.2000
that is by statute a patent is valid upon issuance 35 u.s.c.¡± 282 and included within the presumption of validity is a presumption of non-obviousness
structural rubber prods co. v. park rubber co. 749_f.2d_707 714 fed.cir.1984
since we must presume a patent valid the patent_challenger bears the burden of proving the factual elements of invalidity by clear and convincing_evidence.5 that burden of proof never shifts to the patentee to prove validity
hybritech inc. v. monoclonal antibodies inc. 802_f.2d_1367 1375 fed.cir.1986
`` the presumption *1360 [ of validity ] remains intact and [ the burden of proof remains ] on the challenger throughout the litigation and the clear and convincing standard does not change'
id

see mas-hamilton_group v. lagard inc. 156_f.3d_1206 1216 fed.cir.1998 citing hybritech 802 f.2d at 1376 ; cable_elec prods inc. v. genmark inc. 770_f.2d_1015 1022 fed.cir.1985` [ i ] f evidence is presented establishing a prima_facie_case of invalidity the opponent of invalidity must come forward with evidence to counter the prima_facie challenge to the presumption of section 282`
see mas-hamilton_group v. lagard inc. 156_f.3d_1206 1216 fed.cir.1998 citing hybritech 802 f.2d at 1376 ; cable_elec
but all that means is that even though a patentee never must submit evidence to support a conclusion by a judge or jury that a patent remains valid once a challenger introduces evidence that might lead to a conclusion of invalidity-what we call a prima_facie_case-the patentee` would be well advised to introduce evidence sufficient to rebut that of the challenger'
orthokinetics inc. v. safety travel chairs inc. 806_f.2d_1565 1570 fed.cir.1986

however this requirement does not` in substance shift the burden of persuasion' cable_elec. 770 f.2d at 1022 because` the presumption of validity remains intact and the ultimate burden of proving invalidity remains with the challenger throughout the litigation'
mas-hamilton_group 156 f.3d at 1216 ; see also innovative scuba concepts inc. v. feder indus. inc. 26_f.3d_1112 1115 fed.cir.1994 ; ashland oil inc. v. delta resins & refractories inc. 776_f.2d_281 287 fed.cir.1985
the trial_court has the responsibility to determine whether the challenger has met its burden by clear and convincing_evidence by considering the totality of the evidence including any rebuttal evidence presented by the patentee
stratoflex inc. v. aeroquip corp. 713_f.2d_1530 1534 fed.cir.1983

the basis as opposed to the mere existence of an examiners initial finding of prima_facie obviousness of an issued patent is therefore at most only one factual consideration that the trial_court must consider in context of the totality of the evidence` in determining whether the party asserting invalidity has met its statutory burden by clear and convincing_evidence'
fromson 755 f.2d at 1555
it does not however lessen or otherwise affect the burden of proof nor does it require that unless the patentee introduces evidence of secondary_considerations to establish non-obviousness the patent_challenger will necessarily prevail

c. the underlying factual determinations made by the trial_court that this court must review for clear_error include 1 the scope and content of the prior_art 2 the level of ordinary_skill in the art 3 the differences between the claimed invention and the prior_art and 4 objective_indicia of non-obviousness
graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 17 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966)
we start by noting that the parties stipulated to many of the facts but disagree as to the ultimate legal outcome of obviousness based upon those facts
the parties do not dispute that benzene_sulphonate was known in the art at the time of the inventions claimed in the ¡¬909 and ¡¬303_patent s. pfizer admitted that several publications including the berge_article were prior_art to claims 1-3 of the ¡¬303_patent and pertinent to the problem the inventors sought to overcome
neither party disputes the district_courts characterization of the ordinarily skilled_artisan

*1361 further there is really no dispute as to the scope of the ¡¬909_patent and the differences between it and the claimed invention
the ¡¬909_patent specifically states that the pharmaceutically-acceptable_salts of amlodipine` are those formed from acids which form non-toxic acid_addition_salts containing pharmaceutically-acceptable_anions'
¡¬909_patent col.2 ll.3-6
the ¡¬909_patent lists a genus of pharmaceutically-acceptable_anions` such as the hydrochloride hydrobromide sulphate phosphate or acid_phosphate acetate maleate fumarate lactate tartrate citrate and gluconate'
¡¬909_patent col.2 ll.6-9
the only examples of acid_addition_salts of amlodipine are maleates
the ¡¬909_patent does not expressly disclose the benzene_sulphonate_anion nor salts formed from benzene_sulphonic_acid or a larger class of sulphonic_acids in general
but while neither the claims nor the written description of the ¡¬909_patent expressly disclose amlodipine_besylate or the benzene_sulphonate_anion neither do they exclude amlodipine_besylate or the benzene_sulphonate_anion
rather the only limitations placed on the anion are that it is pharmaceutically-acceptable and that in salt_form it is able to produce a non-toxic acid_addition_salt
thus as the district_court found and the parties agree the ¡¬ 909 patent claims literally encompass amlodipine_besylate

by statute a claimed invention is unpatentable if the differences between it and the prior_art` are such that the subject_matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary_skill in the art'
35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a
subsumed within the graham factors is a subsidiary requirement articulated by this court that where as here all claim limitations are found in a number of prior_art_references the burden falls on the challenger of the patent to show by clear and convincing_evidence that a skilled_artisan would have been motivated to combine the teachings of the prior_art_references to achieve the claimed invention and that the skilled_artisan would have had a reasonable_expectation of success in doing so
dystar textilfarben gmbh v. c.h
patrick co. 464_f.3d_1356 1360 fed.cir.2006 ; velander v. garner 348_f.3d_1359 1363 fed.cir.2003
here the parties vigorously disagree

a difficulty in the district_courts opinion arises because in assuming a prima_facie_case of obviousness the district_court did not fully address whether apotex showed by clear and convincing_evidence that a skilled_artisan would have been motivated to combine the teachings of the prior_art_references relied on especially the ¡¬909_patent and berge to achieve the claimed invention
however the district_courts omission in this case is harmless error because evidence of record easily satisfies us that a reasonable_fact-finder could only conclude that apotex has shown by clear and convincing_evidence that the skilled_artisan would indeed have been so motivated to combine the prior_art to produce the besylate_salt of amlodipine
the record also satisfies us that contrary to the district_courts finding a reasonable_fact-finder could only conclude that the skilled_artisan would have had a reasonable_expectation of success with the besylate_salt_form of amlodipine for the reasons elaborated post

motivation to combine prior art references to achieve the claimed invention
pfizer does not argue that there was no motivation to combine the prior_art_references per se
rather pfizer argues that 1 the ¡¬909_patent does not suggest or motivate the skilled_artisan to make amlodipine_besylate because none of the anions *1362 listed in the ¡¬909_patent have a cyclic_structure as does besylate and 2 even if the ¡¬909_patent were combined with berge the skilled_artisan would not have been motivated to make amlodipine_besylate because berge shows that besylate was actually one of the most rarely used anions in the pharmaceutical_industry as only 0.25 % of approved drugs as of 1974 were besylate_salts
finally pfizer asserts that other_prior_art_references relied upon by apotex are not relevant because the examples of besylate_salts disclosed in these references are limited to pharmaceuticals unrelated to amlodipine

we reject pfizers first argument since a suggestion teaching or motivation to combine the relevant prior_art teachings to achieve the claimed invention does not have to be found explicitly in the prior_art_references sought to be combined but rather` may be found in any number of sources including common_knowledge the prior_art as a whole or the nature of the problem itself'
dystar 464 f.3d at 1361 ; see also ormco corp. v. align tech. inc. 463_f.3d_1299 1307-08 fed.cir.2006
in other words it is irrelevant that none of the anions specifically listed in the ¡¬909_patent have a cyclic_structure because the motivation to make amlodipine_besylate here is gleaned not only from the prior_art as a whole rather than the ¡¬909_patent alone but also from the nature of the problems encountered with the amlodipine_maleate_tablet_formulations sought to be solved by the inventors of the ¡¬303_patent
in this regard testimony of record evidences that one skilled in the art would have been motivated to choose an anion having a different structure than that of maleate
the maleate_salt ion is acyclic and consists of a double_bond between the carbon atoms whereas the besylate_salt ion is cyclic and lacks the same_double_bond
early in development pfizer discovered that amlodipine_maleate was susceptible to degradation from a michael_addition_reaction in which the double_bond of maleate underwent an addition reaction causing the formation of degradation_products
apotex avers that unrebutted testimony from its expert which we find compelling supports an inference that the skilled_artisan actually would have been encouraged rather than discouraged to choose an anion without the same_double_bond such as benzene_sulphonate in order to avoid the michael_addition_reaction
thus the fact that none of the anions listed in the ¡¬909_patent have a cyclic_structure is hardly dispositive to the question of whether the skilled_artisan would have been motivated to combine the prior_art_references to achieve amlodipine_besylate

we similarly are not persuaded by pfizers second argument as clear and convincing_evidence shows that a skilled_artisan would have been motivated to combine the ¡¬909_patent and berge to make amlodipine_besylate
pfizers expert dr._anderson testified that there were an unlimited number of anions many of which could be used to form pharmaceutically-acceptable_acid_addition_salts
yet a reasonable_fact-finder could not accept dr._andersons testimony that the number of acceptable_anions was` unlimited'
of course new salts can always be made or attempted
however irrefutable evidence shows that a skilled chemist at the time would simply make known pharmaceutically-acceptable_salts of whatever active_ingredient with which he or she was working at the time
indeed mr._davison an inventor of the ¡¬303_patent testified that it` would have been a mistake' to choose a novel anion
rather` part and parcel of pharmaceutically accepted [ ] was to look in pharmacopoeias and compendia' to find an anion having` precedence for use within *1363 the pharmaceutical_industry'
dr._anderson similarly admitted in his testimony that it would have been logical to use berges list of fda-approved anions to produce a drug formulation court what if i sic my phalanx of zealous scientists on that list and then come up with a product
would that be a logical thing for me to do ?
the witness it would be logical to try that
this is true especially given the fact that the genus of fda-approved anions at the time was small i.e. only 53
that benzene_sulphonate was only used in creating 0.25 % of fda-approved drugs is not highly probative much less dispositive
indeed beyond hydrochloride which was used in approximately 43 % of approved drugs almost all other salts could be characterized as` rarely used'
see berge table 1 showing that 40 out of 53 anions were used in less than 1 % of drugs and 23 out of 53 were used in 0.25 % or less of drugs

but the outcome of this case need not rest heavily on the size of the genus of pharmaceutically-acceptable_anions disclosed by berge because clear and convincing_evidence establishes that out of the list of 53 anions one of ordinary_skill in the art would have favorably considered benzene_sulphonate because of its known acid strength solubility and other known chemical characteristics as reported in several other publications pfizer has admitted are prior_art
schmidt discloses that aryl sulphonic_acids such as benzene_sulphonic_acids considerably increase the solubility of pharmaceuticals containing one or more basically reacting nitrogen atoms
¡¬612_patent col.2 ll.14-41
spiegel specifically identifies besylate as the preferred pharmaceutically-acceptable acid_addition_salt_form of a pharmaceutical_compound
¡¬637_patent col.2 ll.38-39
other patents not before the examiner during prosecution of the ¡¬303_patent also point to benzene_sulphonate
u.s._patent 3,970,662 to carabateas 1976` carabateas' discloses an intermediate dihydropyridine compound useful in the form of an acid_addition_salt derived from benzene_sulphonate
¡¬662_patent col.3 ll.35-49 & col.4 ll.20-24
u.s._patent 4,432,987 to barth 1984` barth' assigned to pfizer discloses the besylate_acid_addition_salt_form of a pharmaceutical_composition having excellent pharmacokinetic properties near-optimal solubility and improved stability
¡¬987_patent col.2 ll.45-46
taken together these references provide ample motivation to narrow the genus of 53 pharmaceutically-acceptable_anions disclosed by berge to a few including benzene_sulphonate

the district_court ignored the significance of these other_prior_art_references suggesting the besylate_salt because the pharmaceuticals disclosed in those prior_art_references were not described as useful to treat hypertension or angina as is amlodipine
by not considering these references in its obviousness analysis however the district_court clearly erred
as here the besylate_acid_addition_salt_form was described in these prior_art_references as useful in promoting stability and solubility as well as improving other physicochemical_characteristics
that none of these references discloses a medication for treating hypertension or angina like amlodipine is therefore unimportant if not actually irrelevant
as pfizer concedes the besylate part of the acid_addition_salt has no therapeutic_effect but merely serves as a means to deliver the amlodipine_part of the molecule to the body
prior art disclosing the use of benzene_sulphonate for improving the bioavailability of other pharmaceuticals-especially a dihydropyridine as disclosed by carabateas-is therefore highly relevant in weighing the factors relating to obviousness

*1364 considering all of the evidence we hold that a reasonable_fact-finder could only conclude that apotex indeed produced clear and convincing_evidence that one skilled in the art facing the problems including the stickiness of the tablet_form of the maleate acid_addition_salt would have been motivated to combine the teachings of the ¡¬909_patent berge and other_prior_art to produce the besylate_salt of amlodipine

reasonable expectation of success
as noted above the district_court found that the skilled_artisan would have had no expectation of success in making a besylate_salt of amlodipine because there was no reliable_way to predict the influence of a particular_salt_species on the active part of the compound
we can not reject the district_courts finding that in 1986 it was generally unpredictable as to whether a particular salt would form and what its exact properties would be
the problem with the district_courts ultimate_conclusion of non-obviousness based on that factual_finding however is that case_law is clear that obviousness can not be avoided simply by a showing of some degree of unpredictability in the art so long as there was a reasonable probability of success
see in re corkill 771_f.2d_1496 1500 fed.cir.1985` although [ the inventor ] declared that it can not be predicted how any candidate will work in a detergent composition but that it must be tested this does not overcome [ the prior_arts ] teaching that hydrated zeolites will work
`` ; see also brown & williamson tobacco corp. v. philip morris inc. 229_f.3d_1120 1125 fed.cir.2000 ; merck & co. inc. v. biocraft labs. inc. 874_f.2d_804 809 fed.cir.1989 ; in re merck & co. inc. 800_f.2d_1091 1097 fed.cir.1986
indeed a rule of law equating unpredictability to patentability applied in this case would mean that any new salt-including those specifically listed in the ¡¬909_patent itself-would be separately patentable simply because the formation and properties of each salt must be verified through testing
this can not be the proper_standard since the expectation of success need only be reasonable not absolute
merck 874 f.2d at 809 ; in re o'farrell 853_f.2d_894 903 fed.cir.1988

the evidence would convince a reasonable finder of fact that the skilled_artisan would have had that reasonable_expectation of success that an acid_addition_salt of besylate would form and would work for its intended_purpose
see in re rinehart 531_f.2d_1048 1053-54 c.c.p.a.1976
specifically the evidence clearly shows that as soon as tablet processing problems arose with the amlodipine_maleate_tablet_formulations dr._wells readily compiled a list of seven alternative_anions-including the besylate-each of which he expected would form an amlodipine_acid_addition_salt q
and one of the reasons why you chose these various_salts [ sic ] or suggested these various_salts [ sic ] is because you expected that they would be able to make a salt of them correct ?
a
there was an expectation but that was n't guaranteed
but once again only a reasonable_expectation of success not a guarantee is needed
o'farrell 853 f.2d at 903 ; brown & williamson 229 f.3d at 1125
that reasonable_expectation of success is further amply reflected in dr._wells further testimony that he expected these seven amlodipine_acid_addition_salts would show improved physicochemical_characteristics over the maleate_salt including improved stability and non-stickiness q
and when you chose these salts.. you believed that if you could in fact *1365 make an amlodipine salt out of them these might be a cure for the problems you were having with maleate correct ?
a
indeed

we also note that the ¡¬909_patent placed no limitations on the acid_addition_salt whatsoever except that it be non-toxic and formed from an acid containing a pharmaceutically-acceptable anion
accordingly the ¡¬909_patent contained a strong suggestion that any and all pharmaceutically-acceptable_anions would form non-toxic acid_addition_salts and would work for their intended_purpose-that is to improve bioavailability of the active_ingredient amlodipine and to improve handling and storage of amlodipine
indeed in proceedings before this court in pfizer v. dr._reddys laboratories involving the ¡¬909_patent pfizer downplayed any difference between amlodipine_maleate and any other acid_addition_salt_form of amlodipine including the besylate prompting this court to observe that the sole active_ingredient is amlodipine and that it acts the same in the human body whether administered as a besylate_salt or as a maleate_salt
359 f.3d at 1366

finally there is a suggestion in pfizers supplemental filing with the fda that it was known that the besylate_salt of amlodipine would work for its intended_purpose` we feel that the change in salt_form [ from maleate to besylate ] is justified since benzenesulfonate is a commercially acceptable_salt as exemplified by the tranquilizer_mesoridazine serentil'
thus although dr._wells testified that it was not guaranteed whether amlodipine_besylate would form and what its salient characteristics would be` this does not overcome [ the prior_arts ] teaching that [ amlodipine_besylate ] will work'
corkill 771 f.2d at 1500

considering all of the evidence we conclude that the district_court clearly erred in finding that apotex failed to produce clear and convincing_evidence that one skilled in the art would have had a reasonable_expectation of success with the besylate_salt of amlodipine

'' obvious-to-try` to be sure` to have a reasonable_expectation of success one must be motivated to do more than merely to vary all parameters or try each of numerous_possible_choices until one possibly arrived at a successful_result where the prior_art gave either no indication of which parameters were critical or no direction as to which of many possible choices is likely to be successful'
medichem s.a. v. rolabo s.l. 437_f.3d_1157 1165 fed.cir.2006 internal_quotations omitted
pfizer argues that if anything amlodipine in its besylate_salt_form would at most be` obvious to try' i.e. to vary all parameters or try each of numerous_possible_choices to see if a successful_result was obtained
o'farrell 853 f.2d at 903

parties before this court often complain that holdings of obviousness were based on the impermissible` obvious to try' standard and this court has accordingly struggled to strike a balance between the seemingly conflicting truisms that under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103` obvious to try' is not the proper_standard by which to evaluate obviousness in re antonie 559_f.2d_618 620 c.c.p.a.1977 but that under o'farrell and other precedent absolute predictability of success is not required
853 f.2d at 903
reconciling the two is particularly germane to a situation where as here a formulation must be tested by routine procedures to verify its expected properties
the question becomes then when the skilled_artisan must test how far does that need for testing go toward supporting a conclusion of non-obviousness ?

*1366 as we have said before` [ e ] very case particularly those raising the issue of obviousness under section 103 must necessarily be decided upon its own facts'
in re jones 958_f.2d_347 350 fed.cir.1992
consequently courts can not decide the obviousness or non-obviousness of a patent claim by proxy
undue dependence on mechanical application of a few maxims of law such as` obvious to try' that have no bearing on the facts certainly invites error as decisions on obviousness must be narrowly tailored to the facts of each individual case
as we stated in dystar obviousness is a complicated subject requiring sophisticated analysis and no single case lays out all facets of the legal test
[ there is ] danger inherent in focusing on isolated dicta rather than gleaning the law of a particular area from careful reading of the full text of a group of related precedents for all they say that is dispositive and for what they hold
when parties.. do not engage in such careful candid and complete legal analysis much confusion about the law arises and through time can be compounded
464 f.3d at 1367
on the facts of this case however we are satisfied that clear and convincing_evidence shows that it would have been not merely obvious to try benzene_sulphonate but would have been indeed obvious to make amlodipine_besylate

first this is not the case where there are` numerous parameters' to try
rather the only parameter to be varied is the anion with which to make the amlodipine_acid_addition_salt
although we recognize some degree of unpredictability of salt_formation see e.g. sanofi-synthelabo v. apotex inc. 470_f.3d_1368 1379 fed.cir.2006 the mere possibility that some salts may not form does not demand a conclusion that those that do are necessarily non-obvious
this is especially true here where 1 as noted above the skilled_artisan had a reasonable although not guaranteed expectation that amlodipine_besylate would form ; 2 pfizer conceded in prior litigation that the type of salt had no effect on the therapeutic_effect of the active_ingredient amlodipine and was practically interchangeable pfizer v. dr._reddys labs. 359 f.3d at 1365-66 ; and 3 numerous other publications described above clearly directed the skilled_artisan to a pharmaceutically-acceptable acid_addition_salt made from benzene_sulphonate including significantly the carabateas_patent which taught the besylate_acid_addition_salt_form of another dihydropyridine pharmaceutical_compound

second this is not the case where the prior_art teaches merely to pursue a` general approach that seemed to be a promising field of experimentation' or` gave only general guidance as to the particular form of the claimed invention or how to achieve it'
o'farrell 853 f.2d at 903 ; medichem 437 f.3d at 1167
here as admitted by mr._davison in selecting an acid_addition_salt_formulation one skilled in the art looked to pharmacopoeias and compendia to find a salt that was previously approved by the fda and used successfully within the pharmaceutical_industry
berge clearly pointed the skilled_artisan to 53 anions that as of 1974 were pharmaceutically acceptable
as dr._wells testimony and the carabateas_patent demonstrated one of ordinary_skill in the art was capable of further narrowing that list of 53 anions to a much smaller group including benzene_sulphonate with a reasonable_expectation of success

finally pfizer protests that a conclusion that amlodipine_besylate would have been obvious disregards its` discovery' because it was obtained through the use *1367 of trial and error_procedures
while the pharmaceutical_industry may be particularly adversely impacted by application of an` obvious to try' analysis see e.g. in re merck 800 f.2d at 1100 baldwin j. dissenting that pfizer had to verify through testing the expected traits of each acid_addition_salt is of no consequence because it does not compel a conclusion of non-obviousness here
in coming to this conclusion we have not ignored the fact that` [ p ] atentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which the invention was made'
35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a
nor are we ignorant of the fact that reference to` routine_testing' or` routine_experimentation' is disfavored
see e.g. in re yates 663_f.2d_1054 1056_n._4_(c.c.p.a.1981)` the solicitor.. argues that it isnot unobvious to discover optimum or workable_ranges by routine_experimentation
in many instances this may be true
the problem however with suchrules of patentability and the ever-lengthening list of exceptions which they engender is that they tend to becloud the ultimate legal issue-obviousness-and exalt the formal exercise of squeezing new factual situations into preestablished pigeonholes
additionally the emphasis upon routine_experimentation is contrary to the last_sentence of section 103'
( internal_citation omitted ; in re saether 492_f.2d_849 854 c.c.p.a.1974` in his argument thatmere routine_experimentation was involved in determining the optimized set of characteristics the solicitor overlooks the last_sentence of 35 u.s.c.¡± 103..
here we are concerned with the question of whether the claimed invention would have been obvious at the time it was made to a person having ordinary_skill in the art-not how it was achieved'
( internal_citation omitted ; in re fay 52_c.c.p.a._1483 347_f.2d_597 602 c.c.p.a.1965` [ w ] e do not agree thatroutine_experimentation negatives patentability
the last_sentence of section 103 states thatpatentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which the invention was made
to support the boards decision thatroutine_experimentation within the teachings of the art will defeat patentability requires a primary determination of whether or not appellants experimentation comes within the teachings of the art
whether the subsequent experimentation is termedroutine or not is of no consequence
``

however on the particularized facts of this case consideration of the` routine_testing' performed by pfizer is appropriate because the prior_art provided not only the means of creating acid_addition_salts but also predicted the results which pfizer merely had to verify through routine_testing
merck 874 f.2d at 809
the evidence shows that upon making a new acid_addition_salt it was routine in the art to verify the expected physicochemical_characteristics of each salt including solubility ph stability hygroscopicity and stickiness and pfizers scientists used standard techniques to do so
these type of experiments used by pfizers scientists to verify the physicochemical_characteristics of each salt are not equivalent to the trial and error_procedures often employed to discover a new_compound where the prior_art gave no motivation or suggestion to make the new_compound nor a reasonable_expectation of success
this is not to say that the length expense and difficulty of the techniques used are dispositive since many techniques that require extensive time money and effort to carry out may nevertheless be arguably` routine' to one of ordinary_skill in the art
rather our conclusion here relies on the fact that one skilled in the art would have had a reasonable_expectation of success at the time the invention was made and merely had to verify that expectation
cf
velander v. *1368 garner 348_f.3d_1359 1368 fed.cir.2003 that one skilled in the art would view variability in producing fibrinogen in transgenic mammals as evidence that` expense time and effort' would be involved did not equate to a conclusion that success was unlikely
simply put to conclude that amlodipine_besylate would have been obvious` the prior_art common_knowledge or the nature of the problem viewed through the eyes of an ordinary artisan' merely had to suggest reacting amlodipine base with benzene_sulphonic_acid to form the besylate acid_addition_salt and that that acid_addition_salt_form would work for its intended_purpose
dystar 464 f.3d at 1361
they did
see o'farrell 853 f.2d at 904

we find this case analogous to the optimization of a range or other variable within the claims that flows from the` normal desire of scientists or artisans to improve upon what is already generally known'
in re peterson 315_f.3d_1325 1330 fed.cir.2003 determining where in a disclosed set of percentage ranges the optimum combination of percentages lies is prima_facie obvious
in in re aller 42_c.c.p.a._824 220_f.2d_454 456 1955 our predecessor court set forth the rule that the discovery of an optimum_value of a variable in a known process is usually obvious
see also in re boesch 617_f.2d_272 276 c.c.p.a.1980` [ d ] iscovery of an optimum_value of a result effective variable in a known process is ordinarily within the skill of the art`
similarly we hold that the optimization of the acid_addition_salt_formulation for an active_pharmaceutical_ingredient would have been obvious where as here the acid_addition_salt_formulation has no effect on the therapeutic_effectiveness of the active_ingredient and the prior_art heavily suggests the particular anion used to form the salt
cf
in re geisler 116_f.3d_1465 1470 fed.cir.1997` [ i ] t is not inventive to discover the optimum or workable_ranges by routine_experimentation
`` quoting aller 220 f.2d at 456 ; in re kulling 897_f.2d_1147 1149 fed.cir.1990 finding no clear_error in board of patent appeals and interferences conclusion that the amount of eluent to be used in a washing sequence was a matter of routine_optimization known in the pertinent prior_art and therefore obvious
indeed the logical line of testing was to react benzene_sulphonate with amlodipine to confirm the presence of a salt and then to verify that the physicochemical_properties of amlodipine_besylate were adequate particularly the trait of sufficient non-stickiness
the experimentation needed then to arrive at the subject_matter claimed in the ¡¬303_patent was` nothing more than routine' application of a well-known problem-solving strategy merck 874 f.2d at 809 and we conclude` the work of a skilled [ artisan ] not of an inventor'
dystar 464 f.3d at 1371 ; see also in re luck 476_f.2d_650 652-53 c.c.p.a.1973 use of routine_testing to identify optimum amounts of silane to be employed in a lamp coating without establishing a critical upper limit or demonstrating any unexpected result lies within the ambit of the ordinary_skill in the art ; in re esterhoy 58_c.c.p.a._1116 440_f.2d_1386 1389 1971` one skilled in the art would thus manifestly operate the switzer et al
process under conditions most desirable for maximum and efficient concentration of the acid
the conditions recited in the claims appear to us to be only optimum and easily ascertained by routine_experimentation
`` ; in re swentzel 42_c.c.p.a._757 219_f.2d_216 219 1955` it may well be that the size represents the largest particles suitable for appellants purpose but the determination of that desired size under the present circumstances involves nothing more than routine_experimentation *1369 and exercise of the judgment of one skilled in the art
`` ; in re swain 33_c.c.p.a._1266 156_f.2d_246 247-48 1946` in the absence of a proper showing of an unexpected and superior result over the disclosure of the prior_art no invention is involved in a result obtained by experimentation
``

thus while patentability of an invention is not negated by the manner in which it was made` the converse is equally true patentability is not imparted wherethe prior_art would have suggested to one of ordinary_skill in the art that this process should be carried out and would have a reasonable likelihood of success
`` merck 874 f.2d at 809 quoting in re dow chem co. 837_f.2d_469 473 fed.cir.1988
for these reasons we hold that apotex introduced clear and convincing_evidence that a skilled_artisan would have had a reasonable_expectation of success with the besylate_salt_form of amlodipine at the time the invention was made
accordingly we agree with the district_court that a prima_facie_case of obviousness was established with regard to the claims of the ¡¬303_patent albeit for different reasons

secondary considerations
before we turn to the remaining conflict between the parties-the district_courts consideration of the objective_indicia of non-obviousness-we must first address the district_courts reference in its bench opinion to pfizers business decision to switch its commercial_product from an amlodipine_maleate_formulation to an amlodipine_besylate formulation apparently as evidence of non-obviousness
see bench_order_tr.at 6:21-7:1` pfizer is a big company which by this time had a large investment in amlodipine_maleate.. a decision to switch to some other product or even to abandon the entire product is the corporate equivalent of turning the queen mary
`` ; bench_order_tr.at 18:17-21` pfizer would not have changed from the maleate into which it had invested both time and research_dollars to seek out a very strange and rare_besylate_salt absent an extremely good_reason`
the district_courts reliance on this` objective_consideration' seems suspect as there is no evidence in the appellate record to support the implicit finding that pfizer ever considered abandoning amlodipine or stood to lose significant time and investment dollars
indeed we are not ignorant of the fact that pharmaceutical companies are in the business of research and development
we therefore disregard the district_courts findings on this point as clearly erroneous or in any event insufficiently probative of non-obviousness to overcome the evidence of the prior_art teachings

evidence of unexpected results can be used to rebut a prima_facie_case of obviousness
peterson 315 f.3d at 1330
the district_court found that while amlodipine_besylate was not superior to amlodipine_maleate in every category of physicochemical_properties it nonetheless` clearly and unexpectedly illustrates a superior_combination of properties when compared to' amlodipine_maleate.6 with regard to solubility the ¡¬303_patent discloses that amlodipine_besylate has a solubility of 4.6 mg/ml at ph 6.6 whereas amlodipine_maleate has a solubility of 4.5 mg/ml at ph 4.8
the district_court stated that any product having a solubility greater than *1370 1.0 mg/ml is acceptable and that` [ t ] he rest is sound and fury'
bench_order_tr.at 11:10
we conclude from this statement that the district_court did not find that the solubility of amlodipine_besylate was materially superior much less` unexpectedly superior' to the solubility of amlodipine_maleate
similarly we also conclude that the district_court did not rely on non-hygroscopicity as a secondary_consideration
thus the two allegedly unexpected and superior_properties remaining are drug stability and tablet processing

with respect to stability the district_court found that the ¡¬303_patent provided an ordinal listing of several tested salts descending in rank order from the most stable to the least stable where the besylate_salt was the most stable of the eight salts tested and the maleate_salt was the sixth most stable salt
the district_court also found that amlodipine_besylate was` sufficiently nonsticky to obtain commercial processability'
pfizer asserts that these improvements have significant practical value and are indicative of non-obviousness

in contrast apotex asserts that the district_court committed several errors when assessing secondary_considerations
specifically apotex asserts that the district_court erred by comparing amlodipine_besylate only to the maleate preferred_embodiment disclosed in the ¡¬909_patent rather than the entire genus of amlodipine_salts claimed therein
apotex also asks this court to discount pfizers evidence of unexpectedly superior_properties because the stability and drug processing properties of amlodipine_besylate are neither` unexpected' nor` surprising'
finally apotex asserts that even if amlodipine_besylate exhibits a better combination of solubility ph stability non-hygroscopicity and non-stickiness properties than other members of the genus of amlodipine_salts this purported superiority of amlodipine_besylate is not significant enough as a matter of law to make it non-obvious
apotex argues that amlodipine is the active_ingredient and the sole source of therapeutic_effects of amlodipine_besylate whereas the besylate is merely a means of delivering the amlodipine_part of the molecule
thus apotex asserts any salt need only exhibit adequate_physicochemical_characteristics in order to serve its purpose of delivering the amlodipine
apotex contends that the record here demonstrates that the amlodipine_maleate tablet also performs these same functions
the issue before us is whether based upon the evidence as a whole pfizers showing of superior_results was sufficiently unexpected so as to rebut apotexs showing of a prima_facie_case of obviousness

while we agree that the teaching of a prior_art patent is not limited to its preferred_embodiment see merck 874 f.2d at 807` the fact that a specific [ embodiment ] is taught to be preferred is not controlling since all disclosures of the prior_art including unpreferred_embodiments must be considered' the other_amlodipine_salts of which apotex complains i.e. amlodipine tosylate and amlodipine mesylate were not expressly recited in the ¡¬909_patent or elsewhere in the prior_art
thus the district_courts obligation to consider the entire range of prior_art compounds would have been satisfied here by its comparison of the closest_prior_art_compound to amlodipine_besylate
kao corp. v. unilever united_states inc. 441_f.3d_963 970 fed.cir.2006` [ w ] hen unexpected results are used as evidence of nonobviousness the results must be shown to be unexpected compared with the closest prior_art
`` quoting in re baxter travenol labs. 952_f.2d_388 392 fed.cir.1991
however there is precious little if any evidence to support any implicit *1371 finding by the district_court that amlodipine_maleate is actually the closest_prior_art_compound to amlodipine_besylate
indeed the prior_art of schmidt spiegel carabateas and barth discussed above evidences that one skilled in the art would expect an acid_addition_salt made from benzene_sulphonate to have good physicochemical_properties

another defect in the district_courts reasoning is its failure to recognize that by definition any superior_property must be unexpected to be considered as evidence of non-obviousness
in re chupp 816_f.2d_643 646 fed.cir.1987
thus in order to properly evaluate whether a superior_property was unexpected the court should have considered what properties were expected
merck 874 f.2d at 808
here pfizers evidence must fail because the record is devoid of any evidence of what the skilled_artisan would have expected
we will not simply presume that the skilled_artisan would have expected that amlodipine_besylate would have the same characteristics as amlodipine_maleate because as pfizer asserts its properties are not absolutely predictable
further dr._wells testimony reflects the fact that he believed that amlodipine_besylate would solve the problems of amlodipine_maleate
unrebutted testimony from apotexs expert evidences that given the range of 53 anions disclosed by berge one skilled in the art would expect those anions to provide salts having a range of properties some of which would be superior and some of which would be inferior to amlodipine_maleate
pfizer has simply failed to prove that the results are unexpected
boesch 617 f.2d at 278

finally we do not see the trial_courts finding that amlodipine_besylate had adequate_physicochemical_characteristics as sufficient to uphold the courts ultimate holding of unexpected superiority
pfizer rejected amlodipine_maleate not because it failed to exhibit an adequate combination of solubility ph stability in capsule_form and non-hygroscopicity but because it could not be easily manufactured because of stickiness and limited stability of amlodipine_maleate in the preferred commercial form of a tablet
the district_court wrongly relied on the fact that the` besylate_salt works' because considerable evidence shows that amlodipine_maleate also worked for its intended_purpose and even did so in human clinical trials even though somewhat inferior in ease of tableting and projected shelf-life
at most then pfizer engaged in routine verification testing to optimize selection of one of several known and clearly suggested pharmaceutically-acceptable_salts to ease its commercial manufacturing and marketing of the tablet_form of the therapeutic amlodipine
creating a` product or process that is more desirable for example because it is stronger cheaper cleaner faster lighter smaller more durable or more efficient.. to enhance commercial opportunities.. is universal-and even common-sensical'
dystar 464 f.3d at 1368
amlodipine besylate is obvious on the facts of this case because the ¡¬909_patent suggested-and dr._wells expected-that every other potential salt_form of amlodipine would be adequate for its intended_purpose i.e. to increase bioavailability of amlodipine and would solve the stickiness problem of the maleate_salt
the fact that amlodipine_besylate was the best of the seven acid_addition_salts actually tested proves nothing more than routine_optimization that would have been obvious to one of ordinary_skill in the art
see aller 220 f.2d at 456` [ e ] ven though applicants modification results in great improvement and utility over the prior_art it may still not be patentable if the modification was within the capabilities of one skilled in the art`
these facts lead us to conclude that the *1372 resulting commercial embodiment claimed in the ¡¬303_patent amlodipine_besylate does not satisfy the standards of patentability

alternatively we hold that even if pfizer showed that amlodipine_besylate exhibits unexpectedly superior_results this secondary_consideration does not overcome the strong showing of obviousness in this case
although secondary_considerations must be taken into account they do not necessarily control the obviousness conclusion
newell cos. inc. v. kenney mfg co. 864_f.2d_757 768 fed.cir.1988
here the record establishes such a strong case of obviousness that pfizers alleged unexpectedly superior_results are ultimately insufficient
id.at 769

from our de novo assessment of the determination below on obviousness in view of all of the evidence and for the reasons articulated above we conclude that the district_court erred in holding that the claims of the ¡¬303_patent would not have been obvious

iii
conclusion
because we find claims 1-3 of the ¡¬303_patent invalid for obviousness we find it unnecessary to address apotexs assertion that pfizer engaged in inequitable_conduct during prosecution of the ¡¬303_patent and that its patent should therefore be declared unenforceable
for the aforementioned reasons the district_courts judgment is reversed

we reject apotexs assertion that the district_court erred by giving weight to the commercial_success of norvascthe_r
the district_court relied on the production of billions of amlodipine_besylate_tablets by pfizer as evidence of non-stickiness rather than commercial_success
apotexs arguments with regard to an alleged absence of a` nexus' between the claimed features and the sales of norvascthe_r are therefore irrelevant
