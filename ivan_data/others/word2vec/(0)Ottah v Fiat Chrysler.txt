opinion
newman circuit_judge
*1137 chikezie_ottah herein` ottah' appeals the decision of the united_states_district_court for the southern_district of new_york.1 the district_court granted summary_judgment of non-infringement to several defendant automobile companies with respect to u.s. patent no._7152,840` the840_patent` and dismissed the complaint with prejudice as to several other automobile companies
we have reviewed and now affirm the district_courts rulings

background
the840_patent is entitled` book holder' and describes the invention as` a removable book_holder assembly for use by a person in a protective or mobile structure such as a car seat wheelchair walker or stroller'
'840_patent at col._1,_ll._6-9
the book_holder is described as` having an adjustable releasable clipping means and a support arm configured for.. adjustment of the book supporting surface of the book_holder to hold a book in a readable position in front of the user'
id.at col._1,_ll._9-13

in the` background of the invention' the840_patent recites disadvantages associated with prior_art_book_holders such as` [ t ] he book_holders in the prior_art lack the ease of application to a mobile_vehicle such as a wheelchair or stroller to allow the reader to have mobility to explore their environment in a stationary sitting or reclining position while reading a book supported on the mobile device'
id.at col._1,_ll._48-53
the840_patent recites ten` object [ s ] of the present invention' including` provid [ ing ] a book_holder that can be easily and removably attached to and removed from a bar or portion of the mobile_vehicle without tools'
id.at col._1,_ll._64-67
eight of the ten objects refer to the advantages of a holder for books one refers to a writing board and one refers to the removable_attachment of the mounting structures
id.at col._1,_l._64 - col._2,_l._34

claim 1 the only claim of the840_patent reads 1
a book_holder for removable_attachment the book_holder comprising a book_support_platform the book_support_platform comprising a front_surface a rear_surface and a plurality of *1138 clamps the front_surface adapted for supporting a book the plurality of clamps disposed on the front_surface to engage and retain the book to the book_support_platform the rear_surface separated from the front_surface ; a clasp comprising a clip_head a clip_body and a pair of resilient_clip_arms the clip arms adjustably mounted on the clip_head the clip_head attached to the clip_body ; and
an arm comprising a first_end and a second_end and a telescoping arrangement the clasp on the first_end the second_end pivotally attached to the book_support_platform the telescoping arrangement interconnecting the first_end [ to ] the second_end the clasp spaced from the book_support_platform wherein the book_holder is removably attached and adjusted to a reading position by the telescoping arrangement axially adjusting the spaced relation between the book_support_platform and the clasp and the pivotal connection on the book_support_platform pivotally adjusting the front_surface with respect to the arm
id.at col._6,_ll._14-38

the specification describes the claimed book_holder and its removable_attachment
relevant to this suit the specification concludes with the statement that the book_holder may be used to hold items other than books` the book_platform 12 may also be used to support such items as audio/video equipment pdas or mobile phones cameras computers musical instruments toys puzzles and games
the panel 16 may be provided with a set of mounting positions for receiving and/or mounting the above items not shown'
id.at col._5,_ll._35-40
the specification further states although the invention has been described above in connection with particular embodiments and examples it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the invention is not necessarily so limited and that numerous other embodiments examples uses modification and departures from the embodiments examples and uses are intended to be encompassed by the claims attached hereto
id.at col._6,_ll._1-7
the only embodiment that is described and illustrated is for use as a book_holder

in the second_amended_complaint filed in the district_court ottah states` i invented a mobile_camera' and` [ t ] he defendant bmw et al are manufacturing using/making the product
using and selling it
whereby infringing on the patent'
second_amended_complaint ?
c appellees appx80

several defendants including general_motors_llc ; mazda motor corporation ; nissan motors company limited ; fuji heavy industries ; daimler_ag ; and toyota motor corporation collectively the` mtd_defendants' moved to dismiss on the grounds of failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted and for misjoinder
the mtd_defendants argued that the840_patents claim is explicit to a book_holder and thus ottah can not plead a plausible_claim for infringement by a camera_holder

several other defendants including fiat_chrysler ; ford_motor_company ; hyundai_motor_america ; jaguar_land_rover_north_america ; and kia motor america collectively the` msj_defendants' moved for summary_judgment of non-infringement
the msj_defendants argued that their camera_holders did not meet the` removable_attachment' limitation of claim 1 because the camera_holders on their vehicles can not be removed without tools

the district_court granted the mtd_defendants motion to dismiss with prejudice *1139 characterizing ottahs arguments as` legally implausible'
dist
ct
op. 230 f.supp.3d at 196
the court observed that the840_patents claim is for a book_holder and does not claim a camera_holder or any of a cameras components or functions

the district_court also granted the msj_defendants motion for summary_judgment of non-infringement
id.at 198
the court observed that the federal_circuit has previously ruled on the scope of the840_patents claim holding that the claim requires that any infringing device must be capable of being` removed without tools'
id.at 197 citing ottah v. verifone sys. inc. 524_fed.appx._627 629 fed
cir
2013` verifone'
the court observed that the msj_defendants submitted uncontroverted_evidence that their accused cameras were mounted in such a way that tools were necessary to remove them
id.at 197

the district_court also rejected ottahs argument of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents finding that this equivalency argument was foreclosed by this courts prior claim_construction which was informed by ottahs representations during prosecution
id.at 197-98
additionally the district_court found that the msj_defendants submitted uncontroverted_evidence that their accused cameras did not meet the telescoping arm and adjustability limitations of the840_patent
id.at 198 n.6
the court held that these undisputed facts also require summary_judgment of non-infringement in favor of the msj_defendants

ottah appeals as to all defendants arguing that the district_court erred in all respects

ottah argues that the district_court erred in construing the claim to exclude` fixed mounts' from its scope
ottah also argues that the mention of cameras in the840_patent specification establishes equivalency of a book_platform and a camera platform

this court had previously reviewed claim_construction of the840_patent and ruled that several claim limitations require that the claimed book_holder has a` removable_mounting'
verifone 524 fed.appx.at 629 construing the` removably attached' term
the verifone court held that mounts that can not be removed without tools do not literally infringe claim 1 stating that claim 1` is clear on its face' and that` nothing in the specification suggests that the claim_language should be interpreted in a way at variance with its ordinary meaning'
id

the ruling on claim scope is a matter of` claim_construction' which is ultimately a question of law

1942` under the doctrine of stare_decisis where a court has in one case decided a question of law it will in subsequent cases in which the same question of law arises ordinarily decide it in the same way
the doctrine is not rigidly applied and a court will sometimes overrule its prior decisions
the doctrine of stare_decisis is applicable although the parties in the later action are different from those in the prior actions

cir
2008` under the principles of stare_decisis and the supreme_courts guidance in markman this court follows the claim_construction of prior panels absent exceptional circumstances`
here it was shown that the msj_defendants accused cameras utilize fixed mounts that require tools for removal
as such the accused devices are outside the literal scope of claim 1

this court in verifone also held that prosecution_history estoppel prevents claim 1 from encompassing under the doctrine of equivalents` fixed mounts' that require tools for removal
verifone 524 fed.appx.at 630
as discussed in verifone ottah argued during prosecution that patentability of claim 1 was based on the removable structure of the mount
id.at 629-30
claim 1 was only allowed over the prior_art after ottahs argument emphasizing removability
see appl
no._1 0/366,779 reply dated july_25,_2005 at 13` [ t ] he use of adjustable resilient_clip_arms on the clasp for clasping the book_holder to the movable vehicle providing quick removal without tools.. is not obvious in light of the prior_art'

in the second circuit grant of a motion to dismiss is reviewed de novo to determine whether the claim is plausible on its face accepting the material_factual allegations in the complaint and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff
see ashcroft v. iqbal 556_u.s._662 678 129_s.ct._1937 173_l.ed.2d_868_(2009)` to survive a motion to dismiss a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter accepted as true to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face
a claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged'

the district_court found that` [ t ] he840_patent contains no claim that can be plausibly construed to cover a mobile_camera device a mounted camera or any kind of camera'
dist
ct
op. 230 f.supp.3d at 197
the district_court found that the840_patents single claim does not mention a camera or recite typical functions or components of a camera
id.at 196
the court also found that` [ t ] he fact that [ ottahs ] book_holder could be used to hold a camera does not make it the equivalent of a mobile_camera'
id.at 197

ottah argues that the district_court erred and that the mtd_defendants` back up camera' infringes claim 1
ottah reply br.at 5
ottahs only support for this argument are the general statements from the specification quoted ante that the book_holder can hold items other than books whereby cameras should be deemed the equivalent of books
however claim 1 is explicitly limited to books although ottah states and the specification supports that other items may be supported by the book_platform
the record suggests that the limitation of claim 1 to books served to limit the scope of examination to prior_art_book_holders as reflected in the prosecution_history
thus the record negates access to equivalency of cameras and books
see johnson & johnston assocs inc. v. r.e
serv co. 285_f.3d_1046 1054 fed
cir
2002 en banc` [ a ] patentee can not narrowly claim an invention to avoid prosecution scrutiny by the pto and then after patent issuance use the doctrine of equivalents to establish infringement because the specification discloses equivalents`
the district_court correctly found that the` book_holder' can not plausibly be construed to include or be the equivalent of a *1142 camera_holder in view of the specification and the prosecution_history

in addition to requiring tools for removal contrary to the prosecution_history and express claim_language that the book_holder must be` removably attached' the accused camera structures were not alleged to have the claimed` telescoping arrangement' or to possess a` front_surface adapted for supporting a book' as required by claim 1
these differences are not insubstantial and are reflected in the limitations in claim 1
see catalina mktg int l inc. v. coolsavings.com inc. 289_f.3d_801 812 fed
cir
2002` [ t ] he patentee must show that the accused device meets each claim limitation either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents`
we have liberally construed the pleadings but have concluded that the second_amended_complaints accusation of infringement lacks plausibility
the district_court correctly dismissed ottahs complaint with prejudice

conclusion
we have considered all of ottahs arguments and affirm the judgment of the district_court

affirmed
