kao_corp. v. unilever_u.s. inc. 334_f.supp.2d_527 d.del.2004
the district_court exercised jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1338
this court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1
for the reasons set forth below we affirm the judgment of the district_court

background
this case involves a dispute over the patent rights to a cosmetic skin-care product used to remove` keratotic_plugs' -commonly known as blackheads-from facial skin
kao is the owner of a keratotic plug removing product and holder of the patent in suit
unilever produces the allegedly infringing product ponds clear_pore_strips

a
the patent in suit
the application that matured into the382_patent was filed on november 12 1996 and entitled` keratotic plug remover'
the patent which issued on october 23 2001 contains seven claims
kao asserted only independent claim 1 and dependent claim 3 against unilever
claim 1 recites as follows a method for removing keratotic_plugs from skin with a cosmetic_article which comprises wetting the skin or said cosmetic_article ; applying onto the skin said cosmetic_article ; and peeling off said cosmetic_article after drying ; wherein said cosmetic_article comprises *966 i a substrate selected from the group consisting of woven cloth non-woven cloth and a plastic film ; and
ii on said substrate a layer comprising a copolymer in an amount effective to remove keratotic_plugs wherein said copolymer is a poly alkyl vinyl_ether/maleic_acid copolymer or a polyalkylvinyl_ether/maleic anhydride copolymer.1

'382_patent col._12,_ll._58-66 ; col._13,_ll._1-9 emphasis added
claim 3 recites` the method of claim 1 wherein said substrate is a non-woven cloth'
id.at col._13,_ll._12-13

the underlined language in claim 1 is central to this controversy
it was added as an amendment to the claim
kao explained [ t ] he claim has further been amended to clarify the steps of the method
the addition of the wetting_step is not further limiting since the wetting_step was implied in the previously submitted claim
no new matter would be added by entry of this amendment

the written description provides eight examples relating to the preparation and use of a liquid or semi-solid copolymer preparation
the examples do not mention drying the liquid or semi-solid copolymer onto a substrate but instead discuss applying the copolymer directly to the face
example 1 specifically states` a panel washed their [ sic ] face and used the preparation on their faces at an application rate of 0.1 ml/cm 2'
id.at col._6,_ll._6-8
example 2 states` the polymers were individually prepared into an aqueous 20-30 % by weight solution and members of the panel used in the same manner as in example 1'
id.at col._7,_ll._21-23
similarly example 3 appears to describe liquid formulations that were applied as described in example 1
examples 4-8 do not expressly state that the keratotic_plug_remover was applied as a liquid formulation but offer formulations in terms of percent weight like the formulations described in examples 1-3

the written description of the382_patent does not define the term` cosmetic_article' as used in claim 1
instead the written description states that` [ t ] he keratotic_plug_remover according to this invention may take a form of a poultice using cotton cloth rayon cloth tetron cloth nylon cloth either woven or non-woven or using a plastic film sheet beside pack preparations'
id.at col._5,_ll._19-22
the written description further states that` [ t ] he manner of removing keratotic_plugs by the use of the keratotic_plug_remover of the invention is the same as the manner of using ordinary packs and poultice
namely when a pack preparation is used it is first applied to the part of the skin which has keratotic_plugs particularly likely to the nose chin and forehead and after dried it is peeled off'
id.at col._5,_ll._26-31

the district_court concluded and the parties do not dispute that` [ i ] n the context of cosmetics the termpack means a cosmetic paste applied to the skin and allowed to dry` ; the term`poultice means a moist soft mass of bread meal clay cloth or other adhesive substance usually heated spread on cloth and applied to warm moisten or stimulate an aching or inflamed part of the body
`` kao_corp. 334 f.supp.2d at 534_n._4

the district_court also construed what it termed the` copolymer_limitation' of claim *967 1-the language stating` wherein said copolymer is a poly alkyl vinyl_ether/maleic_acid copolymer or a polyalkylvinyl_ether/maleic anhydride copolymer' -to mean` either poly alkyl vinyl_ether/maleic_acid copolymer or poly alkylvinyl_ether/maleic_acid anhydride copolymer but not the salt_form thereof'
id.at 545
concluding that` a salt copolymer is a distinct chemical entity from both an acid copolymer and an anhydride copolymer' the court declined` to broaden the plain language of the claim by reading a salt limitation into it'
id.at 546
it also cited elements of the prosecution_history in favor of such a limitation including-but not limited to-the fact that after filing the application for the382_patent kao filed another application` with claims specifically directed to the salts of the copolymers claimed in the382_patent'
id
the district_court took this as evidence that the382_patent does not cover salt_forms

b. unilevers accused infringing product
unilevers ponds clear_pore_strips are advertised to remove blackheads and unclog pores
the strips consist of a coated non-woven fabric and list the ingredients as pvm/ma_copolymer and aminomethyl propanol` amp'
the coating for the ponds strips is prepared by mixing 98 % by weight of a solution of pvm/ma with 2 % by weight of amp
the amp reacts with the pvm/ma to form what unilever and the district_court describe as a salt
the instructions provided on the accused product involve wetting the strip applying it to the face letting it dry for fifteen minutes and then removing it

c. proceedings in the district court
kao sued unilever for damages and injunctive relief in november of 2001 alleging that the ponds product infringed the382_patent
it later dropped the claim for damages
in october of 2003 the district_court held a three-day bench trial at the close of which it dismissed kaos willful infringement claim
on september 3 2004 the district_court issued a ruling that the382_patent was valid and enforceable but not infringed by the ponds product
the district_court found inter alia that the382_patent adequately described the claimed step of wetting a dried preparation before applying it to the skin ; that although unilever had made out a prima_facie_case of obviousness kao successfully rebutted that case with evidence of unexpected_results ; and that kao did not engage in inequitable_conduct in the prosecution of its patent when it withheld negative data from the examiner

discussion
a
the written description requirement
the district_court concluded that kao complied with the written description_requirement set forth in 35 u.s.c.¡± 112
because compliance with the written description_requirement is a question of fact we review the trial_courts determination for clear_error
lampi corp. v. am
power prods. inc. 228_f.3d_1365 1378 fed.cir.2000
clear error review` does not entitle this court to reverse the district_courts finding simply because it would have decided the case differently'
miles labs. inc. v. shandon inc. 997_f.2d_870 874 fed.cir.1993
we must uphold the trial_courts determination if it is` plausible in light of the entire record or where it chooses one of two permissible views of the evidence'
id

section 112 of the patent_act states that the` specification shall contain a written description of the invention'
35 u.s.c.¡± 112
we have held that` [ t ] o *968 fulfill the written description_requirement the patent specification must describe an invention in sufficient detail that one skilled in the art can clearly conclude that the inventor invented what is claimed'
cordis corp. v. medtronic ave inc. 339_f.3d_1352 1364 fed.cir.2003
we have cautioned however that` [ t ] he disclosure as originally filed does not.. have to provide in haec verba support for the claimed subject_matter at issue'
id

here the district_court based its conclusion that kao satisfied the written description_requirement on two premises
first it stated that the words of the claim itself` plainly and directly satisfy the standard employed by the federal_circuit in assessing written description' because` the phrasewetting the skin or said cosmetic_article fairly appraises persons of ordinary_skill in the cosmetic field that either the cosmetic_article or the skin.. must be wet prior to application'
kao_corp. 334 f.supp.2d at 550
second it stated that based upon the sequence of events described in the specification` [ t ] he wetting_step which appears necessary to aid in the adhesion of the claimed cosmetic_article is so straightforward that a detailed description in the specification is not necessary'
id.at 551
unilever directs its appeal at the trial_courts second rationale arguing that the inferential step taken by the trial_courts analysis is necessarily inadequate to demonstrate that` kaos inventors were in possession of their invention'

we disagree
unilever argues primarily that because` packs' and` poultices' -the only embodiments identified in the description-are already wet the references to drying are insufficient to alert a person having ordinary_skill in the art to the wetting_step
the district_court rejected that argument below and we are poorly positioned relative to the finder of fact to draw a contrary conclusion
although unilevers arguments are not without force we conclude that the district_courts judgment that kao complied with the written description_requirement was not clearly erroneous

b. obviousness
section 103 of the patent_act provides that` [ a ] patent may not be obtained.. if the differences between the subject_matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject_matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary_skill in the art'
35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a
because patents are presumed to be valid see 35 u.s.c.¡± 282 an alleged infringer seeking to invalidate a patent on obviousness grounds must establish its obviousness by facts supported by clear and convincing_evidence
apotex usa inc. v. merck & co. 254_f.3d_1031 1036 fed.cir.2001
here the district_court concluded that unilever had not met its burden of proof
kao_corp. 334 f.supp.2d at 558-59
we review the district_courts factual determinations for clear_error and review the ultimate conclusion of obviousness or nonobviousness without deference
oakley inc. v. sunglass hut int l 316_f.3d_1331 1339 fed.cir.2003

the trial_court found and the parties do not dispute that unilever raised a prima_facie_case that the382_patent was obvious in light of` the combination of the gueret552_patent and the gangadharan107_patent'
kao_corp. 334 f.supp.2d at 558
the district_court also concluded however that` secondary considerations' -in particular the discovery by kao of` unexpected_results' -were sufficient to rebut the prima_facie_case such that` the382_patent is not invalid for obviousness' in light of the gueret and gangadharan prior art
id

*969 here unilever challenges the trial_courts findings regarding` unexpected_results'
it raises both procedural and substantive arguments alleging that the district_court erred in finding unexpected_results because first` kao never notified unilever of its intent to rely on unexpected_results to challenge unilevers proof that kaos patent was obvious' ; second in assessing the unexpected_results claim the district_court failed to use` the closest_prior_art' ; and third the district_court failed properly to assess` the totality of the evidence' which according to unilever establishes that the382_patent was obvious even in light of the unexpected_results

unilever argues that because kao never notified it of its intention to use unexpected_results in defending the obviousness challenge the district_courts` implicit refusal to grant unilevers request that such evidence be barred constitutes an abuse of discretion'
unilever claims to have suffered` both surprise and substantial prejudice' as a result of kaos alleged failure which according to unilever violated both federal rule of civil procedure 16 e stating that a pretrial_order` shall control the subsequent course of the action unless modified by a subsequent order' and local rule 16.4 d stating that a pretrial_order shall contain` a statement of the issues of law which any party contends remain to be litigated'

kaos response to these allegations appears in a footnote which reads in its entirety as follows unilever asserts at 32 that it was somehow surprised at kaos reliance on unexpected_results to prove non-obviousness
however kao only relied upon the unexpected_results it demonstrated to the examiner during the prosecution_history to prove non-obviousness
unilever was certainly aware of this prosecution_history and at trial unilever introduced it into evidence

in its initial brief unilever devotes precisely one sentence to its argument that kaos actions prejudiced it` unilever was unable to develop any evidence or argument to rebut kaos assertion of unexpected_results during discovery or at trial'
despite kaos insubstantial response in the red brief unilevers reply brief does not refer at all to the procedural challenge
given the paucity of unilevers arguments in this regard-and in particular the fact conceded by implication that the unexpected_results relied on by kao were in the prosecution_history which was introduced into evidence by unilever-we have no basis on which to conclude that the trial_court abused its discretion in managing its own trial procedures
see trs
of the univ
of penn
v. lexington ins co. 815_f.2d_890 911_n._17_(3d_cir.1987) stating that the third_circuit` will only interfere with a district_courts management of its pretrial_order where there is a clear abuse of discretion' internal_quotation omitted2

unilever next argues that the district_court erred in judging the unexpected_results in light of the wrong prior art-namely the gueret_patent
the district_court in finding that kaos evidence of` a keratotic plug removal_ratio of 23 %' constituted unexpected_results compared that ratio to the 4 % ratio achieved using polyvinyl alcohol in the gueret_patent
kao *970 corp. 334 f.supp.2d at 558
this court has held that` when unexpected_results are used as evidence of nonobviousness the results must be shown to be unexpected compared with the closest_prior_art'
in re baxter travenol labs. 952_f.2d_388 392 fed.cir.1991
unilever now asserts that gangadharan not gueret was clearly the closest_prior_art and that the district_courts analysis of the unexpected_results was therefore erroneous

unilevers argument is not sustainable
even if we were to conclude that gangadharan was clearly the closest_prior_art unilever has not demonstrated or even alleged that gangadharan achieved a removal_ratio of anything close to the 23 % reported by kao.3 that is unilever has not alleged that kaos results would be any less` unexpected' compared to gangadharan than compared to gueret
in the absence of such an allegation any error made by the trial_court in using gueret for its comparison would be harmless

finally unilever argues that the district_court failed to assess properly the` totality of the evidence' of obviousness and in so doing committed error
unilever argues that` [ t ] he mere existence of a secondary indicia [ of nonobviousness ] does not necessarily rebut a finding of obviousness' and that` [ e ] ven if the erroneous finding of unexpected_results is credited the overwhelming weight of the evidence demonstrates that the382_patent is obvious'
our cases make clear that there is no hard-and-fast rule for determining whether evidence of unexpected_results is sufficient to rebut a prima_facie_case of obviousness
we have stated for example that rebuttal of a prima_facie_case` can consist of a comparison of test data showing that the claimed compositions possess unexpectedly improved properties' but also that` [ e ] ach situation must be considered on its own facts'
in re dillon 919_f.2d_688 692-93 fed.cir.1990 en banc
certainly we have stated on several occasions that unexpected_results may be sufficient to rebut a prima_facie_case of obviousness
see e.g. in re de blauwe 736_f.2d_699 706_n._8_(fed.cir.1984) stating that` [ a ] proper showing of unexpected_results will rebut a prima_facie_case of obviousness'

unilever argues that even if we accept kaos evidence of unexpected_results the remaining evidence in the record is so overwhelming that the unexpected_results are insufficient to overcome it
it argues that the two prior_art_references` disclose every limitation of the claimed invention and provide a strong motivation for their combination' and that while` [ t ] he heart of kaos alleged_invention is.. the use of' the particular polymers identified in the patent` gangadharan invented the use of this copolymer as a keratotic_plug_remover prior to kaos alleged_invention and described a species of this polymer pvm/ma asmost preferred for removing keratotic_plugs
``

unilevers argument is not sustainable
the` overwhelming evidence' it cites is little more than the very evidence used to establish the prima_facie_case
if the evidence used to establish the prima_facie_case were necessarily sufficient to overcome rebuttal of that case rebuttal would be impossible
that result is simply not logical

unilevers real argument is that the 23 % removal_ratio figure cited by the trial_court as the` unexpected result' is unreliable and therefore an inappropriate basis for *971 rebutting the prima_facie_case
we address that allegation in our discussion of the inequitable_conduct issue below

c. inequitable conduct
at trial unilever alleged that the382_patent was rendered unenforceable by kaos allegedly inequitable_conduct during its prosecution
it alleged inequitable_conduct on two grounds ; the one relevant here is unilevers claim that kao` provid [ ed ] the examiner with misleading test results for the claimed copolymer in the 1998 uemura declaration'
kao_corp. 334 f.supp.2d at 561
specifically unilever charges that kao willfully failed to report the test results for one variant of pvm/ma gantretz an-119 because those results indicated substantially weaker results than were reported for another variant an-169

in order to clearly understand the argument some background is necessary
in late 1998 the328_patent was facing rejection on multiple grounds including that its claims were` not commensurate with' the evidence kao had submitted to that point
in may of 1999 kao provided the examiner with a second declaration from inventor uemura the` second_uemura_declaration'
the second_uemura_declaration contained data showing results for samples of a copolymer solution of a particular weight gantretz an-169 a high molecular weight variant and a polyvinyl alcohol solution representative of the gueret prior art
id.at 539
the data submitted to the examiner showed that the an-169 solution achieved a` keratotic removal_ration [ sic ]' of 23.3 % while the polyvinyl solution achieved a ratio of only 3.7 %
id
the discrepancy between those results became the basis for the` unexpected_results' relied upon by the trial_court to overcome unilevers prima_facie_case of obviousness

the record indicates however and the trial_court found that the second_uemura_declaration selectively disclosed only the most positive available data
it failed to reveal several significant facts first that the inventors also tested a low molecular weight pvm/ma variant an-119 which only achieved a removal_ratio of 14.4 % ; and second that the inventors did not disclose the margins of error for their tests which were 7.1 % for the an-big_token__169_and_5__big_token2 % for the an-119
in depositions the inventors were unable to offer any explanation for their failure to report all the results
id.at 539-40
moreover the second_uemura_declaration also contains a statement that` there is no reason to expect any significant difference in keratotic plug removal for other polymers within the claimed genus'
as unilever points out this was untrue the an-119 results provide evidence of precisely such a difference

unilever argues that kaos failure to report the full results of its testing constitutes inequitable_conduct that renders the entire patent unenforceable
the district_court disagreed concluding that although the omission was` material' it was not made with intent to deceive
id.at 563
the determination of inequitable_conduct is squarely within the discretion of the trial_court and we review its determination only for abuse of that discretion
purdue pharma l.p. v. endo pharms. inc. 438_f.3d_1123_(fed.cir.2006)
we review any underlying factual determinations for clear_error and the trial_courts factual findings` will not be disturbed on appeal unless this court has a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made'
id.at 1128

an allegation of inequitable_conduct will be sustained if its proponent demonstrates by clear and convincing_evidence` that material information was intentionally *972 withheld for the purpose of misleading or deceiving the patent examiner'
allied colloids inc. v. am
cyanamid co. 64_f.3d_1570 1578 fed.cir.1995
the first question then is whether the information withheld was` material'
see digital control inc. v. charles mach
works 437_f.3d_1309 1314 fed.cir.2006
the district_court found that the information at issue here was material and the parties do not dispute that finding
the district_court then addressed the second question whether kao omitted the information with intent to mislead or deceive
the trial judge found that it did not
kao_corp. 334 f.supp.2d at 563
in drawing that conclusion she noted that the omitted an-119 data-but not the margins of error-was ultimately presented to the examiner` albeit over one year after' the second_uemura_declaration was submitted
id
`` based upon this submission' the trial_court` infer [ red ] that plaintiffs were not trying to conceal the lower ratio from the examiner'
id

unilever alleges that in so ruling the trial_court abused its discretion
we disagree
intent to deceive` can not be inferred solely from the fact that information was not disclosed ; there must be a factual basis for a finding of deceptive intent'
purdue pharma 438 f.3d at 1134
here although there certainly was evidence from which the trial_court could have concluded that kao acted with intent to deceive we are very reluctant to question the judgment of the finder of fact who appears to have considered the relevant evidence-including the rather glaring failure of the inventors to offer any rationale for the omission-in rendering the decision
see id
( declining to infer intent to deceive in similar circumstances
the trial_court evidently placed considerable weight on the fact that kao did eventually submit most of the omitted data to the examiner
given a blank slate we might weigh the evidence differently
given the limited scope of our review however we can not second-guess the trial_courts decision

d. infringement
the district_court concluded that unilevers product did not literally infringe the382_patent because it did not meet the` copolymer' limitation of claim 1
the court construed that limitation` to mean either poly alkyl vinyl_ether/ maleic_acid copolymer or poly alkyvinyl_ether/maleic anhydride copolymer but not the salt_form thereof'
kao_corp. 334 f.supp.2d at 548
it then stated that it was` uncontested' that there were` differences in chemical composition between the claimed pvm/ma and the pvm/ma_acid-salt' used by unilevers product
id
the primary difference was that unilevers product contains 98 % by weight of pvm/ma_copolymer and 2 % by weight of amp which` reacts with the pvm/ma to form a salt'
id.at 541
the trial_court noted that` [ t ] he experts also agree that the claimed pvm/ma_copolymer and the pvm/ma_acid-salt have different chemical compositions which can be characterized by differences in their solubility viscosity and infrared spectra data'
id.at 548
this evidence provided the basis for the trial_courts finding of noninfringement kao` failed to carry [ its ] burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the accused product literally meets the copolymer_limitation of claim 1'
id.at 549

kao cross-appeals the trial_courts finding of noninfringement arguing primarily that unilevers product literally infringed the382_patent because first unilevers product in fact uses the pvm/ma_acid and not the salt ; and second even if unilevers product does use the salt this courts precedent provides that a salt can infringe an acid claim` if the salt provides the same *973 beneficial effect as the acid
`` 4 we address these issues in turn

kao argues that contrary to the district_courts finding` unilever does not use the salt' form of pvm/ma but the acid form
it bases this conclusion on the fact that the addition of 2 % amp to the pvm/ma only slightly neutralizes the acid such that` 85.5 % of the acid_groups do not include a salt and only 14.5 % of the acid_groups include a salt'
it repeats its assertion-unsupported by any reference to the record or any other_authority-that the resulting compound is only` a slightly neutralized_acid and not a salt'

unilever retorts that` [ a ] ll of the experts agree that a chemical_reaction between pvm/ma and amp_results in the formation of a salt'
the record supports this assertion
kao offers no response to unilevers account of the record testimony beyond a conclusory assertion unsupported by citation to the record that unilevers account is` not correct'
we note also that the relevant claim limitation reads` copolymer' to mean either form of pvm/ma` but not the salt_form thereof'
kao_corp. 334 f.supp.2d at 545
the relevant question is not whether unilevers compound is a salt but whether it is` a salt_form of' pvm/ma
kao has offered this court no basis on which to conclude that it is not.5

kao also argues that even if the unilever product uses the salt it nevertheless literally infringes the382_patent because` the slight neutralization' effected by the addition of amp to pvm/ma` has no affect on the ability of the claimed pvm/ma to remove keratotic_plugs'
kao cites this courts decision in merck & co. v. teva pharmaceuticals usa inc. 347_f.3d_1367_(fed.cir.2003) for the proposition that` a claim that recite [ s ] an acid' may be` literally infringed by the salt of the acid' where` both the acid and its salt functioned similarly'
here kao argues even unilever does not dispute that the chemical changes effected by combining pvm/ma with amp have no effect at all on the function of the invention that is on the ability to remove keratotic_plugs

kaos reliance on merck and a similar case stephens v. tech international 393_f.3d_1269_(fed.cir.2004) is misplaced
the portions of those cases addressing the acid/salt issue both involve patent claims that were held to include salt_forms
merck 347 f.3d at 1371-72 ; stephens 393 f.3d at 1274-75
the district_courts claim_construction in this case expressly excluded the salt_form of pvm/ma rendering merck and stephens readily distinguishable on this among other grounds

kao also relies on our decision in suntiger inc. v. scientific research funding group 189_f.3d_1327_(fed.cir.1999)
suntiger involved a lens patent and an *974 alleged infringing product that featured in addition to a lens similar to the claimed lens a gray coating over most of the lens that allegedly altered the light transmission properties of the lens
the district_court granted summary_judgment of noninfringement concluding that the addition of the coating` changed an inherent property' of the lens and thereby avoided infringement despite the fact that a portion of the accused product did in fact meet all the patents claim_limitations
id.at 1336
we reversed stating that` we have never required that a claim read on the entirety of an accused device in order to infringe' and that one can not` avoid infringement merely by adding elements if each element recited in the claims is found in the accused device'
id

kao analogizes to our ruling in suntiger arguing that here as in that case the addition of a novel element-here the amp-does` not fully eliminate an inherent feature of the claim' -here` the ability of the pvm/ma to remove keratotic_plugs'
kaos analogy is unhelpful
the core principle of suntiger is that the failure of some portion of an accused product to meet all the claim_limitations is insufficient to sustain summary_judgment of noninfringement where another portion of the accused product does meet all the claim_limitations
that is not the situation here where-because the district_court did not err in determining that unilevers product used a salt not the claimed acid-no portion of the accused product meets all the claim_limitations
where as here no part of the accused infringing product meets all the claim_limitations of the patent the remedy available to the patentholder is an action under the doctrine of equivalents
kao has not raised a doctrine of equivalents argument and its literal infringement argument fails

the patent_act permits a trial_court to award attorney_fees to the prevailing party` in exceptional_circumstances'

this court has stated that such` exceptional_circumstances' may exist` [ i ] n the case of awards to prevailing accused infringers' where the patentee engaged in` bad_faith_litigation' or in` fraud or inequitable_conduct' in securing the patent

sys. inc. 347_f.3d_1314 1322 fed.cir.2003

here the district_court concluded that` the case at bar is not exceptional such that defendants merit an award of attorneys fees' because` [ n ] othing in the record suggests that plaintiffs engaged in bad_faith_litigation'
kao_corp. 334 f.supp.2d at 564
unilever charges that the district_courts refusal to award attorney_fees was erroneous because kao` engaged in bad_faith_litigation by pursuing its patent claim' in the face of knowledge that given that the382_patent does not cover salt_forms of copolymer it could not possibly be infringed by unilevers product which uses a salt_form of polymer
it further alleges that kao engaged in bad_faith_litigation by pursuing a claim for willful infringement that was` so devoid of merit that during trial the district_court took the rare step of dismissing this allegation at the close of kaos case-in-chief'
finally unilever alleges as discussed above that kao engaged in inequitable_conduct

we may dispose first of the notion that this case merited` exceptional' status on the basis of kaos inequitable_conduct because we have concluded that the trial_court did not abuse its discretion *975 in finding that no such conduct occurred
unilevers bad-faith arguments fare no better
although kaos litigation position with respect to the infringement issue did not prevail it was not so lacking in merit as to warrant` exceptional' status
we conclude that the district_courts decision not to declare this case` exceptional' was not clearly erroneous

conclusion
for the reasons set forth in this opinion and in judge_newmans and judge_mayers partial_concurrences and dissents we affirm the judgment of the district_court as to inequitable_conduct and written description
for the reasons set forth in this opinion and in the partial_concurrence and dissent of judge_newman we also affirm the judgment of the district_court as to obviousness
finally for the reasons set forth in this opinion and in the partial_concurrence and dissent of judge_mayer we affirm the judgment of the district_court as to noninfringement

affirmed

pauline newman circuit_judge concurring in part dissenting in part
i agree that the district_court correctly held the patent to be valid and that there was not inequitable_conduct in obtaining the patent
however the panel_majority has misunderstood the chemistry in holding that neutralization of 14.5 % of the maleic_acid_groups means that the totality is a salt and not an acid
this flawed science led to an incorrect conclusion of law

the claimed maleic_acid copolymer has acid_groups dangling from the polymer backbone as illustrated in the district_courts opinion

?
334 f.supp.2d at 542 words` acid' added

the accused copolymer is identical but with the addition of a small amount of base amp amino methyl propanol 14.5 % of the acid_groups are neutralized to form a salt
it is simply incorrect to state that the accused copolymer is the salt for 85.5 % of the acid is unchanged remaining as the acid
this is not disputed
the district_court and my colleagues have been led into scientific error by` expert' indirection for when 85.5 % of the acid remains the product has not been converted into the salt for 85.5 % is the original claimed copolymer claim 1.. ii.. wherein said copolymer is a poly alkyl vinyl_ether/maleic_acid copolymer or a poly alkyl vinyl_ether/maleic anhydride copolymer
the copolymer is the same whether or not 14.5 % of the acid_groups are neutralized
indeed unilever testified that the purpose of the amp was to act as a plasticizer to make the product less brittle
as shown in the district_courts opinion the accused copolymer has the following structure

*976. ?
id
( words` acid' and` salt' added

the panel_majority states that it is` unsupported by any reference to the record or any other_authority-that the resulting compound is only a slightly neutralized_acid and not a salt
`` maj. op.at 973
that is inaccurate
the record includes the following testimony of professor william j. brittain a chemist and expert witness q were you able to make any conclusion about the amount of the acid_groups which are neutralized by the amp ?
a yes i was
q and what was your conclusion ?
a my conclusion that approximately 15 percent of the acid_groups were neutralized
q what happens to the remaining 85 percent of the groups in the pvm/ma_acid_groups ?
a they remain unchanged
in addition the unilever witness phillip miner testified that the ph before addition of the amp was 2.0 and after addition of the amp was 3.5
these are acidic ph values,1 reflecting that only 14.5 % of the acid_groups have been neutralized

my colleagues appear to have been taken in by the carefully phrased unilever statement that` [ a ] ll of the experts agree that a chemical_reaction between pvm/ma and amp_results in the formation of a salt
`` maj. op.at 972
of course a reaction between an acid and a base produces a salt
but a reaction between 14.5 % of the acid and matching amount of base produces 14.5 % salt leaving 85.5 % unreacted acid
from my colleagues inaccurate science and the conclusion drawn therefrom i must respectfully dissent

mayer circuit_judge concurring-in-part and dissenting-in-part
i agree u.s._patent_no._6306,382 satisfies the written description_requirement kao did not commit inequitable_conduct unilever does not infringe and the trial_courts decision not to award attorney_fees was not an abuse of discretion
however because kaos showing of unexpected_results was insufficient as a matter of law to overcome the prima_facie_case of obviousness established by unilever i dissent from this courts affirmance of nonobviousness

gangadharan u.s._patent_no._5811,107 and gueret u.s._patent_no._5026,552 recite different inventions
indeed gangadharan discloses the use of the copolymers poly alkylvinyl_ether/maleic_acid and poly alkylvinyl_ether/maleic anhydride collectively` pvm/ma' to remove kerototic plugs by a method different from kaos invention ; and gueret discloses kaos method but not the use of pvm/ma
see *977 kao_corp. v. unilever_u.s. inc. 334_f.supp.2d_527 533-35 & 553-55 d.del.2004
therefore because kaos invention was prima facie obvious under either prior_art_reference in view of the other see id.at 554_n._18 discussing the examiners rejection of kaos invention under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a in light of gangadharan alone ; see also id.at 557-58 kao had the burden to demonstrate unexpected_results over both references see in re johnson 747_f.2d_1456_(fed.cir.1984)
however kao introduced no evidence that its invention removed plugs unexpectedly better than gangadharan
even if sufficient to demonstrate unexpected_results so as to overcome gueret a prior_art_reference without the pvm/ma_limitation the tests comparing kaos invention to gueret provided no basis to overcome gangadharan which contains the pvm/ma_limitation
see in re baxter travenol labs. 952_f.2d_388 392 fed.cir.1991 ; merck & co. inc. v. biocraft labs. inc. 874_f.2d_804 806-9 fed.cir.1989 ; johnson 747 f.2d at 1459-61
accordingly there was no legally cognizable basis upon which to conclude that kaos invention performed unexpectedly better than gangadharan and kao did not overcome the prima_facie_case of obviousness established by gangadharan in view of gueret

the district_courts evidentiary_rulings are procedural issues not related to patent law
in resolving such questions we therefore look to the law of the relevant regional circuit-here the third_circuit
see e.g. microstrategy inc. v. bus

unilever does argue that the 23 % figure is exaggerated
that claim is discussed in the section on inequitable_conduct below

kao also makes glancing references to an appeal of the district_courts claim_construction-specifically its conclusion that claim 1 was limited to pvm/ma_acids and not` the salt_form thereof'
kao_corp. 334 f.supp.2d at 545
the only references to this claim_construction argument however appear in the appellees briefs sections` statement of the facts' and` standard of review'
neither the statement of issues presented nor the summary of argument nor the argument section sets forth any substantive discussion of claim_construction
we therefore decline to consider any challenge to the district_courts claim_construction
5
in addition we note that subsequent to filing the382_patent kao filed a separate application` with claims specifically directed to salts of the copolymers claimed in the382_patent'
kao_corp. 334 f.supp.2d at 546
if kao had intended to claim salt_forms of the copolymer in the382_patent the subsequent patent application would have been superfluous
