background
appellants altana_pharma_ag and wyeth accuse appellees teva_pharmaceuticals_usa inc.` teva' sun_pharmaceutical_industries ltd.` sun' et_al
( collectively` defendants' of infringing u.s._patent_no._4758,579` the ¡¬ 579 patent'
wyeth is the exclusive_licensee of the ¡¬579_patent in the united states
the ¡¬579_patent issued on february 9 1988
on january 4 2004 the u.s. patent and trademark office` uspto' granted a 5-year term extension pursuant to 35 u.s.c.¡± 156` the hatch-waxman_act' ; thus the ¡¬ 579 patent expires on july_19,_2010

the ¡¬579_patent is directed to the compound_pantoprazole the active_ingredient in altanas antiulcer drug protonix_the_r
the compound_pantoprazole belongs to a class of compounds known as proton pump inhibitors` ppis' that are used to treat gastric acid disorders in the stomach
ppis inhibit gastric acid secretion through their action on the gastric_acid_pump
when triggered by the body the gastric_acid_pump is established in the secretory_canaliculus of the stomachs parietal_cells via the enzyme h + k +-atpase
once triggered the pump transports protons h + from the inside of the parietal_cell into the cells secretory_canaliculus in exchange for potassium_ions k + which the pump transports from the canaliculus to the inner portion of the cell
the availability of potassium_ions within the canaliculus is attributable to the migration of potassium chloride kci into the canaliculus also from the inside of the parietal_cell
as the pump reabsorbs the k + in exchange for h + extrusion the ci -remains in the canaliculus resulting in the formation of hydrochloric acid hci within the canaliculus which is then secreted into the stomach

although the operation of the gastric_acid_pump was known at the time of the invention at issue the mechanism by which ppis inhibit the gastric_acid_pump was not understood in the art until after the effective filing date of the ¡¬ 579 patent
part of the uncertainty surrounding the method of action for ppis is attributable to the fact *1003 that ppis are prodrugs which are drugs that convert to their active_form after they are delivered within a patients body which typically exhibits a ph of about 5 to about 7
in this regard ppis are acid-activated prodrugs that are converted into their active_form in the highly acidic environment having a ph of about 1 within the secretory_canaliculus of parietal_cells
once converted to its active_form the ppi thereafter binds to one or more cysteine amino acids in the acid pump
this binding inhibits the operation of the gastric_acid_pump

the first commercialized ppi compound was omeprazole which was approved for use by the u.s. food and drug administration` fda' in 1989 under the trade name prilosec_the_r
omeprazole was first synthesized by ab hassle now known as astrazeneca in 1979 and is the subject of u.s._patent_no._4255,431` the ¡¬431_patent`
omeprazole or prilosec_the_r is well known today as a blockbuster drug for the treatment of patients that suffer from heartburn as well as other symptoms that stem from gastro-esophageal reflux disease` gerd'
after the successful commercialization of prilosec_the_r many drug companies including byk gulden altanas predecessor began to develop new ppis to compete with omeprazole

altanas research efforts resulted in the issuance of u.s._patent_no._4555,518` the ¡¬518_patent` and the ¡¬579_patent
the application for the ¡¬518_patent was filed before the ¡¬579_patent and contained a pharmacology section that compared the effectiveness of 18 claimed compounds against four prior_art_compounds
the ¡¬518_patent refers to one of the 18 compounds chosen for testing as compound 12
the ¡¬579_patent which is not related to the ¡¬518_patent claims ppi compounds that are structurally similar to the compounds claimed in the ¡¬518_patent
pantoprazole the compound at issue in this litigation exhibits a structure that is very similar to compound 12 from the ¡¬518_patent

there are three main structural elements to the ppi molecular backbone the benzimidazole ring the methylsulfinyl bridge and the pyridine_ring
the general formula of the ppi disclosed in the ¡¬579_patent is reproduced below

?
¡¬579_patent at 2:5-15
the issues in this case primarily relate to the pyridine_ring the right-most structure on the above compound specifically the radicals located on the pyridine_ring indicated by r2 r3 and r4
the ¡¬ 579 patent teaches that` r3 represents a 1-3c-alkoxy radical one of the radicals r2 and r4 represents a 1-3c-alkoxy radical and the other represents a hydrogen atom -h or a 1-3c-alkyl radical'
id.at 2:28-31
an alkyl is a radical_consisting of carbon and hydrogen atoms arranged in a chain with the general formula cnh2n+i
a common example is methyl -ch3
an alkoxy is a radical_consisting of an alkyl group linked to oxygen
the most simple is methoxy -och3
the only structural difference between compound 12 and pantoprazole is the substituent or radical at the 3-position of the pyridine_ring
in compound 12 it is a methyl_group -ch3 *1004 whereas in pantoprazole it is a methoxy_group -och3

on or about april_6,_2004 teva filed an abbreviated new drug application` anda' pursuant to the hatch-waxman_act requesting fda approval to sell a generic_version of protonix_the_r prior to the expiration of the ¡¬579_patent
sun filed similarly directed anda_applications on or about march_1,_2005 and june_25,_2005
both teva and sun filed paragraph iv certifications in conjunction with their respective anda_applications
following the submission of these anda_applications altana filed suit against teva and subsequently against sun
the district_court consolidated these cases

altana filed a motion for preliminary_injunction on june_22,_2007
in opposition to this motion both teva and sun conceded infringement ; however they maintained that the ¡¬579_patent is invalid.1 specifically the defendants argued that the ¡¬579_patent was obvious in light of the teachings in the following prior_art references 1 altanas ¡¬518_patent 2 the sachs_article,2 3 the bryson_article,3 and 4 the ¡¬431_patent covering omeprazole

in the district_court the defendants obviousness_analysis focused on the selection of compound 12 from the ¡¬518_patent as a lead_compound for modification
the defendants argued that the sachs_article provided motivation for one of skill in the art to lower the pka of a ppi to a value of 4 in order to provide better_stability of the compound in the patients body
the pka_value of a compound is measured on a logarithmic_scale and indicates the degree of the willingness of the compound to accept or donate a proton
the lower the numerical pka of a compound the more acidic and less basic it is
thus at ph 5 a compound with a pka of 4 would be more stable than the compound with a pka of 5
the defendants position was that sachs taught that a pka_value of 4 was a desirable characteristic in a ppi because it would improve the stability of a ppi in the body prior to its introduction to the parietal_cells of the stomach
the defendants further argued that the bryson_article taught how to lower the pka_value
in particular they argued that bryson taught that a methoxy_group at the 3-position of a pyridine_ring provides a lower pka than a methyl_group in that same position
finally the defendants argued that the ¡¬431_patent demonstrated the feasibility of substituting a methoxy_group for a methyl_group at the 3-position of the pyridine_ring in a ppi

the district_court held a hearing to address altanas motion for preliminary_injunction
after considering the evidence and the arguments the district_court denied the requested relief
with respect to the likelihood of success on the merits the district_court found that the defendants had demonstrated a substantial_question of invalidity and the plaintiffs had not shown that it lacked substantial_merit
in particular the court found that one of skill in the art would have selected compound 12 as a *1005 lead_compound for modification
next the court agreed with the defendants interpretation of the sachs reference and found that it provided motivation to one of skill in the art to modify compound 12 to achieve a pka of 4
the district_court also found that the bryson_article taught that a compound with a methoxy_group in the 3-position of a pyridine_ring as opposed to a methyl_group in that position would lower the pka_value to a pka of 4
that court also relied on the ¡¬431_patent to show that such a substitution was feasible
the district_courts examination of the objective_indicia of non-obviousness did not cause it to disregard the prima facie showing of obviousness and the court accordingly found that altana failed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits

the district_court also considered but rejected altanas position on irreparable_harm
altana argued that the following harms would be irreparable if no preliminary_injunction was issued irreversible price_erosion substantial loss of profits decrease in market_share inability to service debts employee layoffs and loss of research_opportunities
the district_court found that these harms were not irreparable and that the defendants would be able to satisfy a judgment should altana prevail at trial
as a result the district_court concluded that altana had failed to show that it would suffer irreparable_harm if the injunction was not issued

based on altanas failure to establish either a likelihood of success on the merits or irreparable_harm the district_court denied the motion for preliminary_injunction
this appeal followed
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1292 c 1

ii
discussion
the decision to grant or deny a preliminary_injunction is within the sound discretion of the district_court
see e.g. abbott_labs
v. andrx pharms. inc. 452_f.3d_1331 1334 fed.cir.2006
an appellant carries a heavier burden when seeking to reverse the denial of a preliminary_injunction than seeking to reverse the grant of a preliminary_injunction
new_england_braiding_co. inc. v. a.w
chesterton co. 970_f.2d_878 882 fed.cir.1992` when a preliminary_injunction is denied the movant.. must show not only that one or more of the factors relied on by the district_court was clearly erroneous but also that a denial of the preliminary_relief sought would amount to an abuse of the courts discretion upon reversal of an erroneous finding
``

to obtain a preliminary_injunction a court examines four factors 1 a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits ; 2 irreparable_harm if an injunction is not granted ; 3 a balance of hardships tipping in its favor ; and
( 4 the injunctions favorable impact on the public interest
see amazon.com inc. v. barnesandnoble.com inc. 239_f.3d_1343 1350 fed.cir.2001 citing reebok int l ltd. v. j. baker inc. 32_f.3d_1552 1555 fed.cir.1994
although the factors are not applied mechanically a movant must establish the existence of both of the first two factors to be entitled to a preliminary_injunction
amazon 239 f.3d at 1350

a
likelihood of success on the merits
a patent holder seeking a preliminary_injunction bears the ultimate burden of establishing a likelihood of success on the merits with respect to the patents validity
entegris inc. v. pall corp. 490_f.3d_1340 1351 fed.cir.2007
if the alleged infringer raises a` substantial_question' *1006 of invalidity the preliminary_injunction should not issue
id ; genentech inc. v. novo nordisk a/s 108_f.3d_1361 1364 fed.cir.1997
the burden on the accused infringer to show a substantial_question of invalidity at this stage is lower than what is required to prove invalidity at trial
`` vulnerability is the issue at the preliminary_injunction stage while validity is the issue at trial'
amazon.com 239 f.3d at 1359` in resisting a preliminary_injunction.. one need not make out a case of actual invalidity..
the showing of a substantial_question as to invalidity thus requires less proof than the clear and convincing showing necessary to establish invalidity itself`
once the accused infringer satisfies this requirement the burden shifts to the patentee to show that the defense lacks substantial_merit
entegris 490 f.3d at 1351

altana argues that the following alleged errors require the reversal of the district_courts order denying the preliminary_injunction 1 the district_courts failure to take into account an accused infringers clear and convincing burden to prove invalidity ; 2 the district_courts selection of compound 12 as a lead_compound ; and 3 the district_courts interpretation of the bryson_article

1
burden of proof
altana first argues that the district_court applied an incorrect_standard in assessing whether altana had shown a likelihood of success on the merits
the district_court set forth the standard it applied` in order to establish likelihood of success on the merits plaintiffs must show that defendants invalidity defenses lack substantial_merit
in other_words if defendants have raised a substantial_question of invalidity plaintiffs are not entitled to a preliminary_injunction'
( citations omitted

according to altana the standard articulated by the district_court incorrectly placed the burden on altana to show that the obviousness_defense lacks substantial_merit rather than putting the burden on the defendants to establish a substantial_question of invalidity
in abbott laboratories the majority opinion specifically addressed the issue of this courts precedent with respect to the burden of showing a likelihood of success in the face of an attack on the validity of a patent
abbott_labs. 452 f.3d at 1334_n._2_(``the_majority_opinion_..._is_duty_bound_by_our_precedent_which_states_exactly_this_proposition.``)
the precedent of this court holds that if the accused infringer` raises asubstantial_question concerning validity enforceability or infringement i.e. asserts a defense that [ the movant ] can not showlacks substantial_merit the preliminary_injunction should not issue'
genentech 108 f.3d at 1364 citing new england braiding 970 f.2d at 882-83 ; see also amazon.com 239 f.3d at 1350-51
more recently the court applied this standard in entegris
490 f.3d at 1351
the district_court did not apply a legally incorrect_standard and we reject altanas first argument

2
district courts obviousness analysis
altana challenges the district_courts obviousness_analysis on the merits
altana argues that the district_court clearly erred when it determined that the defendants obviousness_defense had substantial_merit
in particular altana argues that the district_court allowed the defendants to select compound 12 of the ¡¬518_patent as a lead_compound when the prior_art suggested the availability of numerous other compounds that were at least as promising to modify as compound 12
in addition altana contends that the district_courts findings with respect to the teaching *1007 of bryson are clearly erroneous
we examine each argument

obviousness is ultimately a question of law based on underlying factual_determinations
richardson-vicks inc. v. upjohn co. 122_f.3d_1476 1479 fed.cir.1997
the factual_determinations that form the basis of the legal conclusion of obviousness include 1 the scope and content of the prior_art ; 2 the level of ordinary_skill in the art ; 3 the differences between the claimed invention and the prior_art ; and 4 evidence of secondary factors known as objective_indicia of non-obviousness
graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 17-18 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966)
this court recently explained that` [ w ] here as here the patent at issue claims a chemical_compound the analysis of the third graham factor the differences between the claimed invention and the prior_art often turns on the structural similarities and differences between the claimed compound and the prior_art'
eisai co. ltd. v. dr. reddys labs. ltd. 533_f.3d_1353 1356-57 fed.cir.2008
thus to establish a prima_facie_case of obviousness in cases involving new chemical_compounds the accused infringer must identify some reason that would have led a chemist to modify a known compound in a particular manner
see yamanouchi pharm co. ltd. v. danbury pharmacal inc. 231_f.3d_1339 1344 fed.cir.2000
this standard is consistent with the legal principles announced in the supreme_courts decision in ksr int l co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007)
see takeda chem indus. ltd. v. alphapharm pty. ltd. 492_f.3d_1350 1356 fed.cir.2007 ; eisai 533 f.3d at 1359` in other_words post-ksr a prima_facie_case of obviousness for a chemical_compound still in general begins with the reasoned identification of a lead_compound
``

obviousness based on structural similarity may be proven by the identification of some motivation that would have led one of ordinary_skill in the art to select and modify a known compound in a particular way to achieve the claimed compound
eisai 533 f.3d at 1357
the requisite motivation can come from any number of sources and need not necessarily be explicit in the art
id
( citing aventis pharma deutschland gmbh v. lupin ltd. 499_f.3d_1293 1301 fed.cir.2007
instead` it is sufficient to show that the claimed and prior_art_compounds possess asufficiently close relationship.. to create an expectation in light of the totality of the prior_art that the new compound will havesimilar properties to the old'
id
( quoting in re dillon 919_f.2d_688 692 fed.cir.1990 en banc

our review of the district_courts decision is limited and it is important to place the district_courts findings in perspective
applications for preliminary_injunctions are typically presented on an abbreviated record without the benefit of a full trial
in this case the district_court carefully explained that its obviousness findings were preliminary
in the district_court the defendants attempted to prove that the claims were vulnerable because one of skill in the art would have selected a number of compounds disclosed in the ¡¬518_patent including compound 12 as a starting_point for further_development
based on the record before it the district_court found that` defendants have raised a substantial argument that compound 12 was a natural_choice for further_development in this regard'

ample evidence supported this finding
first the ¡¬518_patent claimed that its compounds including compound 12 were improvements over the prior_art specifically omeprazole the first successful ppi
in addition compound 12 was disclosed as *1008 one of the more potent of the eighteen compounds of the ¡¬518_patent for which data was provided during prosecution
moreover the patent examiner relied on the compounds of the ¡¬518_patent during the prosecution of the ¡¬579_patent
cf
eisai 533 f.3d at 1357` indeed tevas pharmacology expert.. declined to opine on lansoprazoles relevance to an examiner assessing the patentability of rabeprazole
``

beyond this evidence the district_court considered the opinions of qualified experts
the defendants supported their obviousness argument with the declaration of prof. lester a. mitscher ph.d. dr._mitscher was amply qualified to express opinions on the subject matter involved in this case
dr._mitscher expressed his opinion that altanas ¡¬518_patent which disclosed compound 12 was` on the cutting edge of ppi development in june 1984'
dr._mitscher provided the district_court with an overview of the history of ppis and the state of the art as of june 1984
in particular dr._mitscher stated that one of skill in the art would have selected the 18 exemplary_compounds including compound 12 of the ¡¬518_patent over omeprazole from which to pursue further_development_efforts designed to improve the quality and effectiveness of ppis
although altanas expert suggested that one of skill in the art would have selected omeprazole over the compounds of the ¡¬518_patent in part because of toxicity concerns the district_court apparently accepted dr._mitschers contrary opinion
the district_courts reliance on dr._mitschers opinion was not clearly erroneous

beyond the finding that those of skill in the art would have pursued the 18 exemplary_compounds in the ¡¬518_patent the district_court also found that one of skill in the art would have found compound 12 in particular a natural_choice for further_development_efforts
this finding is supported by evidence that compound 12 was one of the more potent ppi compounds disclosed in the ¡¬518_patent
although potency is not dispositive the district_court believed-not unreasonably-that the potency of the compound was a factor that would have led one of skill in the art to select compound 12 from the group for further study
it bears mention that altana itself had selected compound 12 for further_development_efforts although the inventor stated that he ultimately developed pantoprazole by using an unwanted by-product from his scale up work as a starting_point rather than compound 12

altana suggests that the prior_art would not have directed one of skill in the art to select compound 12 over the approximately 90 compounds claimed to be improvements in the ¡¬518 and other prior_art patents or for that matter over the thousands of other compounds included in the prior_art disclosures
in light of dr._mitschers declaration however the district_court had a sufficient evidentiary basis for rejecting that position
moreover to the extent altana suggests that the prior_art must point to only a single lead_compound for further_development_efforts that restrictive view of the lead_compound test would present a rigid test similar to the teaching-suggestion-motivation test that the supreme_court explicitly rejected in ksr
cf
ksr 550 u.s. at 419 127_s.ct._1727` the obviousness_analysis can not be confined by a formalistic conception of the words teaching suggestion and motivation or by overemphasis on the importance of published articles and the explicit content of issued patents
the diversity of inventive pursuits and of modern technology counsels against limiting the analysis in this way`
the district_court in this case employed a flexible approach-one that was admittedly preliminary-and found that the defendants had raised a substantial *1009 question that one of skill in the art would have used the more potent compounds of the ¡¬518_patent including compound 12 as a starting_point from which to pursue further_development_efforts
that finding was not clearly erroneous

the district_court determined that the sachs_article taught those of skill in the art that an effective ppi should have a pka of 4 because a pka of 4 would lead to better_stability of the compound within the body
thus according to the district_court one of skill in the art would have been motivated to modify the prior_art_compounds to reduce their pka to 4
it is not disputed that the author of the sachs_article dr. george sachs is one of the leading researchers in the ppi development field
as such the district_court was entirely justified in selecting the sachs_article as relevant prior_art
moreover although altana disputed the teachings of sachs before the district_court altana does not challenge on appeal the district_courts findings with respect to the sachs teachings
instead altana contends that the district_court made a factual error in interpreting the bryson_article which requires reversal
we now turn to that issue

the bryson_article teaches the pka_values of various chemical groups including methoxy_groups at the 3-position of a simple pyridine_ring
the defendants argued that bryson taught that a methoxy_group at the 3-position of the pyridine_ring would have a lower pka_value than if it had a methyl_group at that position
the district_court accepted this argument but stated` [ a ] ccording to bryson the pka_value of a methoxy_group at such a position is 4 ; however the pka of a methyl_group at this position is 5'
the district_court also stated` bryson undisputably taught that a compound with a methoxy_group at the 3 position of the pyridine_ring would have a lower pka_value namely a pka of 4 that [ sic ] a compound with a methyl_group at that position'
the district_court concluded that` [ w ] hen brysons teachings are combined with the structure of compound 12 and combined with dr. sachss teachings defendants have raised a substantial_question that this combination was at the very least obvious to try and that such would lead to a predictable variation of compound 12 i.e. a compound with better ph5 stability'

altana correctly points out that the district_courts findings that bryson discloses lowering the pka to 4 through the substitution of a methoxy_group are in error
bryson actually discloses values of 4.big_token__83_and_4__big_token91 for simple_pyridine_rings containing a methoxy_group in the 3-position
because pka_values are measured on a logarithmic_scale there is a very substantial mathematical difference in the magnitude of a pka_value of 4 versus a pka_value of 4.83
a value of 4.83 is over 6.7 times larger than a value of 4

this error however does not require reversal unless altana also shows that the district_courts denial of the requested injunction was an abuse of discretion
new_england_braiding_co. 970 f.2d at 882
notwithstanding the district_courts statements the declaration of dr._mitscher clearly does not make such an error in its analysis of the bryson reference
rather the evidence presented by the defendants supports a finding that one of skill in the art would read bryson to teach the lowering of a pka through the substitution of a methoxy_group for a methyl_group at the 3-position of the pyridine_ring

dr._mitscher stated that` bryson indicates that the addition of a methoxy_group at the 3-position decreases the pka of pyridine by 0.27-0.35 pka_units with an average_pka for 3-methoxy pyridine of 4.87'
consistent with dr._mitschers *1010 statements the bryson_article discloses precisely that
the expert also accurately described brysons disclosure of the pka_values of the pyridine_ring with a methyl_group at the 3-position` bryson indicates that the addition of a methyl_group at the 3-position of pyridine increases the pka of pyridine by 0.34-0.53 pka_units with an average_pka for 3-methyl pyridine of 5.66 compared to an average_pka of 5.18 for unsubstituted pyridine'
thus the difference in the average_pka_values of methyl and methoxy substituted pyridine_rings disclosed by bryson is 0.79

under bryson the pka of the methoxy substituted pyridine_ring is substantially lower than the methyl substituted pyridine_ring
the district_courts references to pka_values of` 5' and` 4' although not technically accurate in fact correlate with the difference in magnitude of the pka_values of the substituted pyridines described in bryson
indeed elsewhere in the district_courts opinion the court stated that` if sachs teaches ph5 stability via lowering the pka of the pyridine_ring and bryson teaches how to lower such pka then the purportedly unexpected property of pantoprazole is in fact an expected property'
the defendants as well as the district_court understood that the obviousness position depended on brysons teaching of a way to substantially lower the pka_value of the pyridine_ring.4 the evidence thus supports the district_courts overriding decision that the defendants had made out a sufficient case of obviousness to defer the matter for trial on the merits as opposed to granting the preliminary_relief sought by the plaintiffs
moreover the district_court found that altana had failed to prove irreparable_harm
as we shall explain that finding is not clearly erroneous and under this courts precedent is a prerequisite for preliminary_relief
accordingly although we agree with altana that some of the district_courts findings with respect to bryson were incorrect we do not disturb the district_courts decision on this ground

b. irreparable harm
on appeal altana argues that the district_court abused its discretion when it found that altana had failed to demonstrate irreparable_harm
the district_court supported its findings on irreparable_harm by stating that the plaintiffs had not shown that the defendants were unable to respond in money damages that the harms to the defendants were exaggerated and that altana likely had a business plan in place to deal with the launch of generic competition
the district_court also had difficulty accepting the fact that nycomed which purchased altana during the pendency of this case had failed to account for potential generic launches

altana argues that the district_court committed a legal error by categorically dismissing certain harms-price_erosion loss of market_share loss of profits loss of research_opportunities and possible layoffs-that altana would suffer as not irreparable
altanas primary contention is that the district_court incorrectly stated that the types of harms are as a matter of law not irreparable
the district_court stated` the federal_circuit as well as courts in this district have declared that the types of harms advanced by plaintiffs in the instant lawsuit are not irreparable and thus can not form the basis for granting an injunction'

*1011 altana views the district_courts statement in isolation but a careful review of the district_courts entire analysis on this point reveals that the district_court correctly understood that this court has upheld findings of irreparable_harm based on these very factors
see sanofi-synthelabo v. apotex inc. 470_f.3d_1368 1382-83 fed.cir.2006 affirming the district_courts finding of irreparable_harm based in part on price_erosion
far from supporting a reversal of this case the law cited by the district_court highlights this courts deference to a district_courts determination whether a movant has sufficiently shown irreparable_harm
compare id
with eli lilly & co. v. am
cyanamid co. 82_f.3d_1568 1578-79 fed.cir.1996 affirming the district_courts finding that the movant failed to establish irreparable_harm based in part on the loss of research_opportunities
here we find no error in the district_courts findings that these harms are not irreparable to altana

altana further argues that the district_court erred in weighing altanas awareness of the future harm it would incur at the expiration of the hatch-waxman_act stay which followed the filing of the defendants anda_applications
the district_court however did not directly rely on these facts to show that altana would not be irreparably harmed
rather the district_court found that altanas argument that its business would be crushed by the entry of generic_versions of protonix_the_r was exaggerated in light of the expiration of the hatch-waxman stay.5 the manner in which the district_court addressed the credibility of altanas argument regarding the impact of generic_versions entering the market on altanas business was not clearly erroneous

iii
conclusion
for the aforementioned reasons we affirm

affirmed

newman circuit_judge concurring
in view of the discretionary weight that must be given to a district_courts decision with respect to whether to grant a plaintiffs request for relief pendente lite i concur in the courts affirmance of the district_courts denial of the injunction
although the evidence presented to the district_court does not in my view establish invalidity of the patent on the pharmaceutical product pantoprazole see gonzales v. o centro espirita beneficente uniao do vegetal 546_u.s._418 429 126_s.ct._1211 163_l.ed.2d_1017_(2006)` the burdens at the preliminary_injunction stage track the burdens at trial` at this preliminary stage deference is warranted to the district_courts weighing of the conflicting expert opinions interpreting the evidence
on this basis i concur in sustaining this discretionary action

on appeal sun raises another invalidity defense obviousness-type double patenting in addition to a statutory obviousness_defense
although the double patenting issue was briefed to the district_court in connection with altanas motion for preliminary_injunction the district_court did not address it
assuming arguendo that this issue is properly before this court our disposition of this case renders it unnecessary to consider any issues relating to the obviousness-type double patenting defense

in the july_31,_2007 hearing conducted by the district_court altanas counsel unequivocally stated that neither it nor its partners had any plans to launch a generic_version of protonix_the_r` not under any guise'
in counsels exchange with the district_court he admitted to the district_court that if altana launched its own generic` it would be a different analysis'
according to the briefing before this court however altana did just that
subsequent to the district_courts denial of altanas motion for preliminary_injunction altanas licensee wyeth launched a generic_version of protonix_the_r
