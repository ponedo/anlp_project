opinion
plager circuit_judge
the question in this declaratory_judgment_action is whether a drug compound which in its manufactured state does not infringe the patent in suit becomes infringing as a result of transitory chemical changes that occur in vivo that is as a result of ingestion by the patient
there are fact issues-what changes actually occur when the drug is ingested and how do we know ; there are legal issues-does a compound that changes in the human body into the patented product on its way to becoming the active_ingredient in the drug the original patent on the active_ingredient having earlier expired literally infringe infringe under the doctrine of equivalents or infringe by inducement

the district_court for the district of new_jersey civil action no._91-3423 entered judgment following a bench_trial that plaintiff/appellant zenith_laboratories inc.s zenith commercial_sale of cefadroxil_dc_induces_infringement of u.s. patent 4,504,657 the657_patent1 the patent at issue
zenith_lab inc. v. bristol-myers_squibb_co. 24_uspq2d_1652 1992_wl_340761_(d.n.j.1992) zenith_ii
the657_patent is owned by bristol-myers_squibb_co. bristol
for the reasons set forth we reverse

background
the chemical compound cefadroxil an antibiotic of the cephalosporin family effective against bacteria that are resistant to penicillin was described and claimed in united states patent no._3489,752 the752_patent which issued in 1970 ; the owner was bristol
the claims of the752_patent covered any and all forms of cefadroxil-they described the chemical compound per se
the752_patent expired in 1987

in the meantime bristol set to work to find a commercially useful crystalline_form of the compound that would overcome problems related to manufacture of the product so that it would be usable by humans
the task of developing a commercial production process was assigned to certain of bristols chemists
they developed what became known as the bouzard_monohydrate named after one of the discoverers-a new crystalline_form of cefadroxil
unlike prior_forms of cefadroxil bouzard_monohydrate possesses certain characteristics in its pre-ingested powdered_form related to bulk density solubility and stability manufacturing-related characteristics which make it particularly suitable for packaging into capsules

*1420 the bouzard_monohydrate was the subject of the single claim in the657_patent 1
crystalline 7- [ d -- amino -- p-hydroxyphenyl- acetamido ] -3-methyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid monohydrate exhibiting essentially the following x-ray_diffraction_properties [ a 37-line table of relative_intensities exhibited by bouzard_monohydrate at various scan angles ]

in july 1988 zenith the plaintiff in this declaratory_judgment_action contracted with a spanish company gema s.a. of barcelona gema to become the exclusive united states distributor of the form of cefadroxil manufactured by gema and known as cefadroxil_dc
cefadroxil dc is a hemihydrate form of cefadroxil and thus differs structurally from bouzard_monohydrate.2 zenith and gema then undertook to obtain approval from the food and drug administration fda for commercial marketing in the united states of cefadroxil_dc
pursuant to fda regulations zenith and gema sought abbreviated approval on the grounds that cefadroxil_dc was bioequivalent to a form of cefadroxil monohydrate other than bouzard_monohydrate which had already been approved by the fda for commercial_sale
in october 1990 the fda granted approval.3

in june 1991 after learning of zeniths and gemas efforts to obtain fda approval bristol filed suit against gema and gemas affiliates in the district_court for the district of maryland civil action no
har 91-1765 the maryland_action alleging infringement of the657_patent
subsequently when gema announced it was abandoning its plans to manufacture cefadroxil_dc that suit was dismissed upon stipulation of the parties

zenith then in august 1991 filed the present declaratory_judgment_action against bristol in the district_court for the district of new_jersey
zeniths complaint contained four counts
in count one zenith sought a declaration that cefadroxil_dc does not infringe the657_patent and in count two a declaration that bristol is equitably estopped from asserting that cefadroxil_dc infringes the657_patent
in count three zenith alleged that bristol by initiating the maryland_action violated a consent decree previously entered in settlement of prior litigation between the parties ; and in count four that bristol had engaged in unfair competition
( zenith subsequently added a fifth and still pending count alleging that bristol had committed antitrust violations

bristol then moved to dismiss counts one and two and for summary_judgment on counts three and four
zenith filed cross-motions for summary_judgment on these counts
on december 12 1991 the trial_court granted bristols motion to dismiss count three concerning the prior consent decree on the ground that the count was moot in view of the previous dismissal of the maryland_action
zenith_lab inc. v. bristol-myers_squibb_co. 24_uspq2d_1641 1651 1991_wl_267892_(d.n.j.1991) zenith i
as to zeniths motion for summary_judgment on count one the infringement_count the court stayed that motion pending an oral hearing
id.at 1648
the court denied all other motions
id.at 1648 1650-51

at the hearing on the infringement_count bristol conceded that cefadroxil_dc being a hemihydrate did not literally infringe the657_patent in its pre-ingested form
bristol nevertheless argued that zenith was liable under the patent on two grounds zeniths product infringed under the doctrine of equivalents ; and zeniths product converted into the patented compound in the patients stomach and thus the sale of cefadroxil_dc would induce infringement of the657_patent under 35 u.s.c.¡± 271 b 1988
the trial_court concluded that summary_judgment was appropriate since bristol had not raised a genuine factual dispute on these issues ; and on march_4,_1992 the court granted zeniths motion for summary_judgment on count one

*1421 however subsequently on april_16,_1992 upon bristols motion for reconsideration the court vacated its march_4,_1992 decision
the court denied zeniths motion for summary_judgment on count one on the basis that bristol through two declarations submitted with its motion for reconsideration had demonstrated a genuine dispute on the in vivo conversion issue
consequently it ordered that that count be severed from the remaining counts and tried separately

from may_26,_1992 through june_5,_1992 the court conducted a bench_trial on count one
following the trial the court rejected bristols theory of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
it found that bristol through prosecution_history_estoppel had relinquished coverage of cefadroxil_dc
however the court found that cefadroxil_dc_converts to bouzard_monohydrate in the patients stomach
since an act of literal_infringement thus occurs in the patients stomach as a result of ingestion of cefadroxil_dc the court concluded that zeniths sale of cefadroxil_dc would induce infringement of the657_patent

on august 6 1992 the court in accordance with its findings and conclusions entered judgment for bristol
zenith_ii 24_uspq2d_1652
the court pursuant to 35 u.s.c.¡± 271 e 4 a 1988 ordered that the effective date of any approval by the fda of cefadroxil_dc for commercial distribution and sale by zenith could be no earlier than march_12,_2002 the expiration date of the657_patent
id.at 1676
it subsequently certified the finality of that judgment pursuant to rule 54 b of the federal rules of civil procedure
zenith then filed this appeal

discussion
zenith presents five separate grounds on which the judgment of the trial_court should be reversed
first the claim of the657_patent properly construed does not cover bouzard_crystals which might form momentarily in a patients stomach
second even assuming conversion in vivo is within the scope of the claim there was a failure of proof as to whether any crystals formed in the stomach from ingested_cefadroxil_dc literally infringe the657_patent
third even if such crystals formed there would be no infringing` use' within the meaning of 35 u.s.c.¡± 271 a 1988
fourth the doctrine of equivalents applied in reverse precludes a judgment of literal_infringement
and fifth the court erroneously declined to grant summary_judgment that bristol was equitably estopped from asserting that cefadroxil_dc infringed the bouzard patent

1
we begin with claim construction whether the claim of the657_patent properly construed covers bouzard_crystals which might form momentarily in a patients stomach
zenith argues that due to statements made by bristol during the657 prosecution the657 claim is limited to the pre-ingested powdered_form of bouzard_monohydrate
in those statements_bristol particularly emphasized the superior_manufacturing-related benefits of the pre-ingested form of bouzard_monohydrate in relation to prior_forms of cefadroxil
bristol it is argued thus relinquished coverage of any forms of cefadroxil_dc that do not exhibit these manufacturing-related characteristics-that would obviously include any bouzard_monohydrate formed in a patients stomach

zenith has a point
prosecution history serves as a limit on the scope of claims by excluding any interpretation of the claim language that would permit the patentee to assert a meaning for the claim that was disclaimed or disavowed during prosecution in order to obtain claim allowance
standard oil co. v. american cyanamid co. 774_f.2d_448 452 227_uspq_293 296 fed.cir.1985
the prosecution_history in this case is replete with arguments by bristol that the importance of this invention was the discovery of a way to manufacture the known compound so as to make it commercially available for medical treatment

the difficulty with zeniths argument however is in the nature of the sole claim in the patent
the claim as written and allowed simply describes a compound having specified chemical properties
the question before us is not one of validity whether the *1422 claim would be patentable over the prior_art if the suggested restriction were not applicable
the question here is one of infringement whether there is anything in the claim as issued that limits it to the pre-ingested form keeping in mind the principle that it is improper to read a limitation into a claim` wholly apart from any need to interpret what the patentee meant by particular words or phrases in the claim'
e.i
du pont de nemours & co. v. phillips petroleum co. 849_f.2d_1430 1433 7_uspq2d_1129 1131 fed.cir
) cert
denied 488_u.s._986 109_s.ct._542 102_l.ed.2d_572_(1988)

zenith nonetheless argues that the term` properties' in the claim is the vehicle for incorporating its proposed restriction into the claim
but that term plainly refers to x-ray_diffraction_properties
x-ray_diffraction_properties have nothing to do with the manufacturing benefits which bristol highlighted

zeniths argument suffers from additional infirmities
the657 claim is a claim for a compound
its patentability thus derives from the structure of the claimed compound in relation to prior compounds
see in re spada 911_f.2d_705 708 15_uspq2d_1655 1657 fed.cir.1990
the relevance to patentability of the properties or characteristics exhibited by the compound is limited to assessing the significance of the structural distinctions of the claimed compound over the prior_art
second as we later note in more detail it is not at all clear that the statements concerning these characteristics played a determinative or even significant role in the patent and trademark offices ptos decision to grant the patent
we conclude therefore that while the claim as issued is limited to the crystalline_form of cefadroxil exhibiting the specified x-ray_diffraction_pattern it is not limited to the compound in its pre-ingested form with the manufacturing characteristics which bristol emphasized during prosecution.4

2
we turn next to the question of whether bouzard_monohydrate is actually found in the stomach of patients who ingest cefadroxil_dc
one answer is that no one knows-the scientific fact appears to be that there is no known way to actually sample the contents of patients stomachs at the precise moment and conduct the x-ray diffraction analyses required to ascertain if all 37 lines described in the patent are present

for its proof bristol offered instead the testimony of its principal_scientific_witness dr. harry brittain who described various studies and experiments simulating the environment of the human stomach which were conducted under his auspices ; zenith countered with the testimony of its principal_scientific_witness dr. martha greenblatt
the trial_judge after hearing all the evidence concluded that the bouzard_monohydrate in fact does inevitably form in the patients stomach after ingestion of cefadroxil_dc
in deciding this issue the court specifically resolved the conflicting testimony presented by dr._brittain and dr. greenblatt [ t ] he court finds that brittain has established by a preponderance of evidence well within his range of expertise that cefadroxil_dc in fact converts in vivo to bouzard_monohydrate
the strength of brittains experiments and results is their totality
piece by piece brittain built an impressive collection of data
the results of each series of experiments strengthen the results of each other set of experimental results
the total effect of the experiments is to prove with sufficient certainty the fact of conversion in vivo

* * * * * * [ a ] lthough she may have significant expertise in fields of inquiry unrelated to the issues in this case greenblatt demonstrated little understanding of the problem at issue in this case or the reason for her procedures and thus played no role in the design of her experiments.. was lax in her methodology particularly in the recording of her procedures and observations and in fact did not even participate *1423 in the second series of experiments
the court finds that brittains.. results are simply better supported and vastly more credible
according those findings are adopted by the court
zenith_ii 24 uspq2d at 1664 1668

courts of law are not the optimal fora for trying questions of scientific truth ; even less are appellate courts equipped to choose among conflicting scientific_theories
judges are dependent on the quality and strength of the scientific evidence brought before them
the trial_judge who hears the witnesses and does the initial assessment of the evidence deserves considerable latitude in eventually choosing sides based on what is ultimately an educated guess-that is what judging is about

however in determining whether a claim in a patent has been infringed the scientific_theories utilized must establish the presence of the limitations recited in the claim
in this case dr._brittain based his scientific conclusions on three kinds of tests-visual observation obtained through optical microscopy birefringence comparison and x-ray_diffraction_pattern comparison
the trial_judge explained brittain first established indisputably through photomicrography that cefadroxil_dc_crystals are much smaller than bouzard_monohydrate crystals and are much different in shape
he also established that cefadroxil_dc_crystals exhibit a much weaker birefringence than do crystals of bouzard_monohydrate which are highly birefringent
thus through microscopy brittain could determine with a high degree of certainty whether a sample of wetted cefadroxil_dc had changed its crystalline_form and could conclude to a lesser extent that the form to which it had changed was bouzard_monohydrate
although changes in the physical properties of shape size and birefringence of the cefadroxil_dc_crystals could be conclusively determined through microscopy brittain could not determine by observation alone that the larger more birefringent crystals were necessarily bouzard
to determine conversion to bouzard with great certainty brittain ran x-ray powder diffraction_patterns a technique that in essence takes the` fingerprint' of a crystalline compound
through x-ray diffraction analysis brittain determined with much greater confidence that all of the conversions suspected after optical examination had in fact been to bouzard_monohydrate
( emphasis added id.at 1665
the key piece of evidence then was the x-ray_diffraction_pattern analysis
this is also what the claim in the patent requires
the first two kinds of tests are only inferentially relevant given that the claim is drafted in terms of x-ray diffraction lines
thus they can not substitute for a proper comparison of those lines

and here a major problem arises
in order to establish its case bristol had to show that the accused compound infringed the claim contained in the patent.5 this required bristol to show that the diffraction_pattern of cefadroxil_dc following its conversion in vivo displayed the same diffraction_pattern as that of the claimed compound
the district_court instead of requiring the comparison of the accused compound following conversion to be made with the lines specified in the claim allowed bristol to make the comparison with the diffraction_pattern exhibited by a sample the reference_pattern of a material considered by bristol to be the patented compound

as we have repeatedly said it is error for a court to compare in its infringement_analysis the accused product or process with the patentees commercial embodiment or other version of the product or process ; the only proper comparison is with the claims of the patent
e.g. martin v. barber 755_f.2d_1564 1567 225_uspq_233 235 fed.cir.1985

the difficulty was compounded
the x-ray_diffraction_pattern exhibited by bristols *1424 sample the reference_pattern consisted of a table of only 30 lines of relative_intensities
of this total the court only compared 22 lines to corresponding lines recited in the claim
zenith_ii 24 uspq2d at 1665
based on its comparison the court concluded the two were sufficiently similar to permit bristol to use the reference_pattern in its infringement_analysis
in fact the number of lines recited in the claim is 37
thus 15 of the lines recited in the claim representing about 40 % of the total were not considered by the court in its comparison
although the term` essentially' recited in the claim permits some leeway in the exactness of the comparison with the specified 37 lines of the claim it does not permit ignoring a substantial number of lines altogether
it is the claim that sets the metes and bounds of the invention entitled to the protection of the patent system

on the basis of this evidence the trial_court concluded that when cefadroxil_dc is ingested bouzard_monohydrate is created in a patients stomach that that constitutes an infringing use and that therefore the sale of cefadroxil_dc by zenith would constitute inducement of infringement under 35 u.s.c.¡± 271 b
since the finding of infringement was based on testimony which incorporated an improper comparison and since that comparison was an essential element in the conclusion that infringement occurred the conclusion that zenith by selling cefadroxil_dc would engage in inducement of infringement is insupportable
zenith is correct that there was a failure of proof as to whether any crystals assumed to form in the stomach from ingested_cefadroxil_dc literally infringe the657 claim
in the absence of evidence comparing the657 claim with the cefadroxil_dc after ingestion bristol has failed to establish any infringing use and therefore we must reverse the district_courts conclusion that zeniths sale of cefadroxil_dc_induces_infringement of the657_patent6

3
on the question of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents the trial_court decided for zenith finding that bristol through statements it made during the657 prosecution was estopped via prosecution_history_estoppel from asserting that cefadroxil_dc infringed under the doctrine of equivalents
according to bristol this was error because the statements relied on by the district_court do not support a finding that there was an estoppel ; thus the doctrine of equivalents properly applied provides an alternative ground on which the judgment for bristol could be affirmed

bristols point has merit
the essence of prosecution_history_estoppel is that a patentee should not be able to obtain through litigation coverage of subject_matter relinquished during prosecution
see loctite_corp. v. ultraseal ltd. 781_f.2d_861 870 228_uspq_90 96 fed.cir.1985
the legal standard for determining what subject_matter was relinquished is an objective one measured from the vantage point of what a competitor was reasonably entitled to conclude from the prosecution_history that the applicant gave up to procure issuance of the patent
see prodyne enters. inc. v. julie pomerantz inc. 743_f.2d_1581 1583 223_uspq_477 478 fed.cir.1984 ; kinzenbaw v. deere & co. 741_f.2d_383 389 222_uspq_929 933 fed.cir.1984 cert
denied 470_u.s._1004 105_s.ct._1357 84_l.ed.2d_379_(1985)
here we do not believe a competitor would have been reasonably justified in concluding that bristol through the statements in question gave up coverage of those forms of bouzard_monohydrate other than the pre-ingested form

there is nothing in the record indicating that the statements about manufacturing benefits played any role in the procurement of the657_patent
as noted earlier in these statements_bristol argued the superior_manufacturing-related characteristics exhibited by bouzard_monohydrate in relation to prior *1425 forms of cefadroxil
yet these prior_forms of cefadroxil were never asserted as prior_art by the examiner and the examiner expressly indicated that bristols assertions were not a factor in determining patentability
moreover according to the examiners statement of reasons for allowance the sole basis upon which allowance was challenged and upon which the657_patent was eventually issued was related to a single prior_art reference garbrecht u.s. patent no._3781,282,7 and bristols successful showing that the claimed compound was not inherent in that reference
there is no indication the examiner ever relied on the statements regarding manufacturing-related characteristics in allowing the patent to issue.8

zenith asserts that the statements in question forestalled an obviousness rejection of the claim on the basis of the prior_forms of cefadroxil
that however is at best highly speculative ; it is unpersuasive in view of the examiners statement of reasons for allowance
thus the courts conclusion that the statements in question gave rise to prosecution_history_estoppel is insupportable

however any error in the courts application of prosecution_history_estoppel was harmless ; the courts conclusion that the doctrine of equivalents is inapplicable to this case is correct as a matter of law
to prove infringement under the doctrine of equivalents bristol bore the burden of showing that cefadroxil_dc was the equivalent of bouzard_monohydrate
see corning glass works v. sumitomo elec. u.s.a. inc. 868_f.2d_1251 1259 9_uspq2d_1962 1967 fed.cir.1989
a necessary part of the function/way/result equivalency analysis is the function of the substituted element as seen in the context of the patent the prosecution_history and the prior_art
graver tank & mfg co. v. linde air products co. 339_u.s._605 609 70_s.ct._854 856 94_l.ed._1097_(1950) reh g denied 340_u.s._845 71_s.ct._12 95_l.ed._620_(1950)

in view of bristols numerous statements in the prosecution_history regarding the superior_manufacturing-related benefits of the bouzard_crystal in relation to the prior_forms of cefadroxil it is clear that the primary if not the only function of the bouzard_crystal form of the drug as compared to other forms is to facilitate pre-ingestion manufacturing
no other intended function is described or suggested.9 since any unanticipated production of the bouzard_crystal in the patients stomach as a result of ingesting cefadroxil_dc does not even remotely perform that function the` function' part of the function/way/result test of equivalency is not met
as a matter of law there can be no infringement under the doctrine of equivalents

bristol cites a number of cases to demonstrate that the doctrine of equivalents has been applied to find infringement in situations involving in situ or in vivo conversions
however these cases do not support bristols argument

even assuming that cefadroxil_dc_converts in vivo to bouzard_monohydrate in measurable amounts that particular crystalline_form does not perform the function of facilitating encapsulation
on the record before us the trial_court was correct in his judgment that bristol had failed to establish infringement under the doctrine of equivalents

for the reasons given the judgment of the trial_court in favor of bristol on count one is reversed

the difference is the number of water molecules which are paired with each cefadroxil molecule

the record suggests that the fda subsequently reconsidered and rescinded this approval after bristol filed with the fda a citizens petition seeking to block approval on the grounds cefadroxil_dc was a hemihydrate and thus not bioequivalent to cefadroxil monohydrate
the record does not indicate whether the fda thereafter approved zeniths application

as noted previously zenith offered three other_grounds on which the judgment of the trial_court could be reversed an incidental conversion to bouzard_crystals does not` use' the claimed compound ; the reverse doctrine of equivalents forecloses literal_infringement by conversion ; and equitable estoppel
in view of our disposition of the appeal we need not address these other_grounds for reversal

according to mpep ¡± 1302.14 one of the primary purposes of [ a statement of reasons for allowance ] is to improve the quality and reliability of issued patents by providing a complete file history which should clearly reflect as much as is reasonably possible the reasons why the application was allowed
such information facilitates evaluation of the scope and strength of a patent by the patentee and the public and may help avoid or simplify litigation of a patent
the absence of any reference to the manufacturing related characteristics in the statement of reasons for allowance supports our conclusion that the examiner did not rely on such characteristics in issuing the patent
8
although actual reliance by the examiner need not be shown if an estoppel is to rest upon argument made during the examination process the circumstances must be such as to permit the inference that such reliance in fact occurred
a showing that the conduct in question played a material role in the issuance of the patent usually suffices
see mannesmann demag corp. v. engineered metal prod. 793_f.2d_1279 1285 230_uspq_45 48 fed.cir.1986

it is self-evident that the function can not be described more broadly i.e
as the delivery of therapeutic value to the patient for that is the function attributable to cefadroxil per se which is prior_art in relation to bouzard_monohydrate

in broadview the claimed ingredient was found to be present in the accused product independently of the purportedly substituted ingredient

thus that product literally infringed
equivalence between the two ingredients was not an issue in the case
in studiengesellschaft although it was unclear whether the trial_judge had made findings on the doctrine of equivalents issue we concluded on appeal that any such findings were inappropriate and unnecessary insofar as the courts judgement was sustainable on the basis of literal_infringement
