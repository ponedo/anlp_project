background
the615 and the393_patent s have essentially the same specification and are directed to systems and methods for designing creating and importing data into a viewable_form on a computer so that a user can manipulate the form data and create viewable_forms and reports
'615_patent at abstract
the preferred_embodiment in the specification describes a data_processing_system which has three main components a form_file a data_file and a viewer
id.at 3:4-31 fig._1
the form_file is created using in-house form development tools and is designed to model the physical characteristics of an existing form including the calculations and rule_conditions required to fill in the form
id.at 3:5-14
the data_file referred to as the aatrix universal file` auf' allows data from third-party_applications to be` seamlessly imported' into the form_file program to populate the form fields
id.at 3:14-22
the viewer generates a report by merging the data in the auf file with the fields in the form_file performing calculations on the data and allowing the user to review and change the field values
id.at 3:24-31
claim 1 of the615_patent is representative emphases added 1
a data_processing_system for designing creating and importing data into a viewable_form viewable by the user of the data_processing_system comprising a a form_file that models the physical representation of an original paper *1124 form and establishes the calculations and rule_conditions required to fill in the viewable_form ; b a form_file creation program that imports a background_image from an original_form allows a user to adjust and test-print the background_image and compare the alignment of the original_form to the background test-print and creates the form_file ; c a data_file containing data from a user_application for populating the viewable_form ; and
( d a form viewer program operating on the form_file and the data_file to perform calculations allow the user of the data_processing_system to review and change the data and create viewable_forms and reports

aatrix sued green_shades_software inc.` green_shades' for infringement of the615 and393_patent s. green_shades moved to dismiss the complaint under rule 12 b 6
it argued all claims in the asserted patents were ineligible under ¡± 101
aatrix argued the motion should be denied` to permit claim_construction to go forward and for the [ district_court ] to acquaint itself with the actual inventions'
j.a
198 ; see also j.a
5 204
aatrix also filed declarations discussing the claimed invention which the district_court did not consider in its analysis

the district_court granted green_shades motion and held every claim ineligible under ¡± 101
j.a
33 holding` the615 and393_patent s to be drawn to ineligible_subject_matter'
though not argued by the parties the district_court concluded claim 1 is not directed to any tangible_embodiment and therefore not directed to eligible_subject_matter under ¡± 101
the district_court applied the alice/mayo two-step analysis to the remaining claims at issue
the court held that615_patent claim 2 is directed to the abstract_idea of` collecting organizing and performing calculations on data to fill out forms a fundamental human activity that can be performed using a pen and paper'
j.a
23
it found that the claim_elements do not supply an inventive_concept
it concluded615_patent claim 22 and393_patent claims 1 13 and 17 are substantively the same as615_patent claim 2 and similarly directed to abstract_ideas without inventive_concepts

aatrix moved to modify and vacate the judgment for reconsideration and for leave to amend the complaint
it sought reconsideration of the district_courts tangible_embodiment analysis and leave to file a second amended complaint that it argued supplied additional allegations and evidence that would have precluded a dismissal under ¡± 101 at the rule 12 b 6 stage
the district_court denied these motions stating that` [ u ] pon consideration of the filings and the relevant_case_law the [ district_court ] sees no reason to reconsider its prior_determination
accordingly [ aatrixs ] motions will be denied'

this is true only when there are no factual_allegations that taken as true prevent resolving the eligibility question as a matter of law
indeed we have explained that` plausible factual_allegations may preclude dismissing a case under ¡± 101 where for examplenothing on th [ e ] record.. refutes those allegations as a matter of law or justifies dismissal under rule 12 b 6

if there are claim_construction disputes at the rule 12 b 6 stage we have held that either the court must proceed by adopting the non-moving partys constructions bascom 827 f.3d at 1352 ; content_extraction 776 f.3d at 1349 or the court must resolve the disputes to whatever extent is needed to conduct the ¡± 101 analysis which may well be less than a full formal claim_construction
genetic techs. 818 f.3d at 1373

this is not a case where patent_ineligibility was properly adjudicated with finality at the rule 12 b 6 stage
the district_court erred to the extent it determined that claim 1 of the615_patent is ineligible because it is not directed to a tangible_embodiment
the district_court granted this rule 12 b 6 motion without claim_construction
we have some doubt about the propriety of doing so in this case but need not reach that issue because it did err when it denied leave to amend without claim_construction and in the face of factual_allegations spelled out in the proposed second amended complaint that if accepted as true establish that the claimed combination contains inventive components and improves the workings of the computer

as a preliminary matter the district_court erred to the extent it held that claim 1 of the615_patent is ineligible solely because it is directed to an intangible_embodiment
we have held that claims to pure data and claims to transitory signals embedded with data are directed to ineligible_subject_matter under ¡± 101

claim 1 of the615_patent meets that requirement
like many claims that focus on software innovations it is a system claim
it claims a data_processing_system which clearly requires a computer operating software a means for viewing and changing data and a means for viewing forms and reports
this is very much a tangible system.1 the district_court *1126 erred in holding claim 1 ineligible because it was directed to intangible matter and should have instead performed an alice/mayo_analysis of claim 1

the district_court did perform an alice/mayo_analysis on the remaining claims and dismissed pursuant to rule 12 b 6 concluding that the claims are ineligible
the subsequent refusal to permit an amended complaint was erroneous because at that stage there certainly were allegations of fact that if aatrixs position were accepted would preclude the dismissal

the proposed second amended complaint contains allegations that taken as true would directly affect the district_courts patent_eligibility analysis
these allegations at a minimum raise factual disputes underlying the ¡± 101 analysis such as whether the claim_term` data_file' constitutes an inventive_concept alone or in combination with other elements sufficient to survive an alice/mayo_analysis at the rule 12 b 6 stage
alice/mayo_step two requires that we consider whether the claims contain` aninventive_concept sufficient totransform the claimed abstract_idea into a patent-eligible_application'

see e.g. bascom 827 f.3d at 1352 so holding after analysis of allegations
here allowing aatrix to file the proposed amended complaint which alleges facts directed to the inventive_concepts in its claimed invention would not be futile
see fairwarning_ip 839 f.3d at 1097

aatrixs proposed second amended complaint supplies numerous allegations related to the inventive_concepts present in the claimed form_file technology
it describes the development of the patented invention including the problems present in prior_art computerized form_file creation
j.a

it then presents specific_allegations directed to` improvements and problems solved by the aatrix patented inventions'
j.a
454-57 emphasis removed
as directed to the claimed data_file for example the proposed second amended complaint alleges the inventions claimed in the aatrix_patents allow data to be imported into the viewable_electronic_form from outside_applications
prior art forms solutions allowed data to be extracted only from widely available databases with published database schemas not the proprietary_data_structures of application software
the inventions of the aatrix_patents allowed data to be imported from an end user_application without needing to know proprietary database schemas and without having to custom program the form_files to work with each outside application
the inventions of the aatrix_patents permit data to be retrieved from a user_application and inserted into a form eliminating the need for hand typing in the values and eliminating the risk of transcription error

43-46 describing the development and success of the claimed data_file despite the difficulty in obtaining data from other software vendors given proprietary_data_structures
these allegations about the claimed data_file claim that the data_file is directed to an improvement in importing data from third-party_software_applications

the complaint also alleges that` [ t ] his invention in-creased the efficiencies of computers processing tax forms'
j.a

the claimed invention according to the complaint reduces the risk of` thrashing' a condition which slowed down prior_art systems

the complaint alleges that the claimed software uses less memory results in faster processing speed and reduces the risk of thrashing which makes the computer process forms more efficiently
j.a

these allegations suggest that the claimed invention is directed to an improvement in the computer technology itself and not directed to generic components performing conventional_activities
we have repeatedly held that inventions which are directed to improvements in the functioning and operation of the computer are patent eligible

viewed in favor of aatrix as the district_court must at the rule 12 b 6 stage the complaint alleges that the claimed combination improves the functioning and operation of the *1128 computer itself
these allegations if accepted as true contradict the district_courts conclusion that the claimed combination was conventional or routine
j.a
26
therefore it was an abuse of discretion for the district_court to deny leave to amend

while the ultimate determination of eligibility under ¡± 101 is a question of law like many legal_questions there can be subsidiary fact questions which must be resolved en route to the ultimate legal determination
relevant to this case the second_step of the alice/mayo_test requires examining` the elements of the claim to determine whether it contains aninventive_concept sufficient totransform the claimed abstract_idea into a patent-eligible_application'
alice 134 s.ct.at 2357 quoting mayo 566 u.s. at 72 79 132_s.ct._1289
if the elements involve` well-understood routine [ and ] conventional_activity previously engaged in by researchers in the field' mayo 566 u.s. at 73 132_s.ct._1289 they do not constitute an` inventive_concept'

`` quoting alice 134 s.ct.at 2359
whether the claim_elements or the claimed combination are well-understood routine conventional is a question of fact
and in this case that question can not be answered adversely to the patentee based on the sources properly considered on a motion to dismiss such as the complaint the patent and materials subject to judicial notice

there are concrete_allegations in the second amended complaint that individual elements and the claimed combination are not well-understood routine or conventional_activity
there are also concrete_allegations regarding the claimed combinations improvement to the functioning of the computer
we have been shown no proper basis for rejecting those allegations as a factual matter

below even on the motion to dismiss aatrix argued the district_court should have held claim_construction proceedings to obtain a full_understanding of the claims prior to granting green_shades motion to dismiss
it argued the claims are directed to specific structures defined in the claim language
on the other hand aatrix did not clearly explain which claim_terms required construction or propose a construction of any particular term
we need not decide whether it was proper on that record for the court to grant the motion to dismiss without claim_construction the need for claim_construction might be apparent just from the claim_terms themselves to arrive at` a full_understanding of the basic character of the claimed subject_matter'

we conclude that aatrix is entitled to file its proposed second amended complaint and that ruling makes it unnecessary to decide whether the district_court erred by ruling on the ¡± 101 motion prior to claim_construction
*1129 the briefing and argument on appeal demonstrate a need for claim_construction to be conducted on remand after the amended complaint is filed

on appeal aatrix argues for example that the claimed` data_file' imports data from third-party_applications into a viewable_electronic_form without program-ming each form_file to work with each third-party application which improves interoperability with third-party_software
aatrix cites the specification as support for its argument that the claimed data_file contains an inventive_concept directed to improved importation of data and interoperability with third-party_software
it explains that through the data_file` data from the vendor_application is seamlessly imported into the program' and the data_file imports` only the data for a selected reporting period based on the guidelines programmed into the forms'
'615_patent at 3:14-19 ; 10:59-67 ; see also id.at 12:21-24` by examining the data requirements for a form the vendor_application can determine what data it should supply in the auf to correctly fill in as much of the form as possible`
the specification describes the structure of the data_file including the` forms index file' that` provides the vendor_application with information on the forms available to the program'
id.at 9:46-60 ; see id.at 9:45-12:24
it explains that` allow [ ing ] data to be imported into the viewable_electronic_form from outside_applications' is a` principal object and advantage of the present invention'
id.at 2:46-48 ; see also id.at 5:1-6` in its preferred_embodiment the main program 800 pulls information from the users payroll or accounting applications export_file thus filling in 900 certain information on the form without the user having to type it in
with the export_file a lot of information that would normally have to be manually filled in is tagged for populating fields`
green_shades argues that this purported improvement in importation of data is in fact a routine and conventional use of a computer however at oral argument green_shades conceded that nothing in the specification describes this importation of data as conventional
oral arg.at 34:34-35:53

in assessing the claims under alice/mayo_step two the district_court found that the claimed` data_file containing data from a user_application for populating the viewable_form' describes` awell understood androutine component and function of a computer'
j.a
26
the district_court supplied no reasoning or evidence for its finding that the claimed data_file` describes awell understood androutine component and function of a computer' j.a
26 nor is there any in the record at this stage of the proceedings

at least since the proposal of the second amended complaint and perhaps even before allegations as to facts and the proper construction of the claims have precluded the courts conclusion that the claimed` data_file' is` awell understood androutine component and function of a computer'
j.a
26
the` data_file' limitation may reflect as aatrix argues an improvement in the importation of data from third-party_software_applications
cf
enfish 822 f.3d at 1337` here the claims are not simply directed to any form of storing tabular data but instead are specifically directed to a self-referential table for a computer database`
in light of the allegations made by aatrix the district_court could not conclude at the rule 12 b 6 stage that the claimed elements were well-understood routine or conventional

thus allowing aatrix to file the proposed amended complaint would not have been futile

we vacate the district_courts dismissal pursuant to rule 12 b 6
there are factual_allegations in the second amended complaint which when accepted as true prevent dismissal pursuant to rule 12 b 6
nothing in this opinion should be viewed as going beyond the rule 12 b 6 stage
summary judgment for example involves different standards than rule 12 b 6
on remand the district_court should resolve as necessary claim_construction issues

conclusion
for the foregoing reasons we vacate the district_courts dismissal under rule 12 b 6 and reverse its denial of aatrixs motion for leave to file a second amended complaint

reversed-in-part vacated-in-part and remanded

reyna circuit_judge concurring-in-part dissenting-in-part
i concur with the majoritys decision to vacate and remand to the district_court on the motion to dismiss
like the majority i find that the district_court erred in its conclusion that claim 1 of the615_patent was directed to an abstract_idea because the patent lacked a` tangible_embodiment'
i believe that the` tangible_embodiment' requirement imposed by the district_court also underlined its decision to deny aatrixs motion for leave to file a second_amended_complaint.1 therefore i would vacate and remand on the motion for leave to file a second_amended_complaint as well
as a court we should have decided on this issue alone

i respectfully disagree with the majoritys broad statements on the role of factual evidence in a ¡± 101 inquiry
our precedent is clear that the ¡± 101 inquiry is a legal_question
see intellectual_ventures i llc v. capital one fin corp. 850_f.3d_1332 1338 fed
cir
2017
in a manner contrary to that standard the majority_opinion attempts to shoehorn a significant factual component into the alice ¡± 101 analysis
the problem here is twofold

first the majority_opinion attempts to shift the character of the ¡± 101 inquiry from a legal_question to a predominately factual_inquiry
the risk of this approach is that it opens the door in both steps of the alice inquiry for the introduction of an inexhaustible array of extrinsic evidence such as prior_art publications other patents and expert opinion.2 similarly the majority_opinion strongly suggests that the district_court must require claim_construction where the meaning of a claim_term is placed in controversy even where as here proposed claim_constructions are not presented to the court
maj. op.at 1228-29
one effect of this approach is that a plaintiff facing a 12 b 6 motion may simply amend its complaint to allege extrinsic facts that once alleged must be taken as true regardless of its consistency with the intrinsic record
the majority asserts that its opinion is not intended to extend beyond the 12 b 6 stage but that is not the problem
the problem is that the 12 b 6 procedure is converted into a full blown *1131 factual_inquiry on the level of ¡± 102 ¡± 103 and ¡± 112 inquiries
clearly this approach would turn the utility of the 12 b 6 procedure on its head in particular in the context of ¡± 101 which is primarily focused on the` allegations' in the patent-the claims and written description
that said despite the majoritys attempt to cabin its opinion to 12 b 6 i see little to prevent argument that these notions extend also to summary judgment proceedings

second the posture of the case on appeal does not support the majority_opinion
the motion to dismiss on appeal only challenges the first amended complaint
there was no motion to dismiss filed challenging the second_amended_complaint
therefore the` new' allegations and evidence3 discussed by the majority were not raised before the district_court
thus the part of the majority_opinion devoted to the second_amended_complaint is dicta
as an appellate court we should not pass judgment on matters not addressed by the district_court
here we must first give the district_court the opportunity to perform a ¡± 101 analysis in light of this new complaint which we can later review if at all
see singleton v. wulff 428_us_106 120 96_s.ct._2868 49_l.ed.2d_826_(1976)` it is the general rule of course that a federal appellate court does not consider an issue not passed upon below`
nor should we prejudge whether the second_amended_complaint survives a rule 12 b 6 motion to dismiss in the first instance particularly when the defendant green_shades has had no opportunity to present arguments with respect to the new pleading

the majority attempts to expand this courts law regarding patent_eligibility under ¡± 101 at the rule 12 b 6 stage
this contradicts our case law that patent_ineligibility under ¡± 101 is a question of law and that it can be appropriately decided on a motion to dismiss
