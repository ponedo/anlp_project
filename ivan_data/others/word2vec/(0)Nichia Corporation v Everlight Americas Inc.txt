background
i. nichia_corporation is an led company that manufactures and supplies leds in markets around the world
nichia corp. v. everlight elecs co. no._0213-cv-702 2016_wl_310142 at *1 e.d
tex
jan._25,_2016` nichia'
both parties agree that` nichia is the worlds largest supplier of leds'
j.a
2113 ?
154
it sells leds in america through its subsidiary nichia *1332 america corp. nichia also researches and develops led_technology including the technology disclosed in the three patents nichia asserted in this case

everlight buys chips from suppliers and packages them into leds
nichia 2016_wl_310142 at *1
it sells leds in the u.s. directly to customers and through its subsidiaries
id

ii
nichia accused everlight of infringing three of nichias patents u.s. patent nos._8530,250 7,432,589 and 7,462,870
all three disclose package_designs and methods of manufacturing led_devices
all three patents use a shared set of vocabulary known in the art as shown below on a common configuration of an led ?
id.at *4 ; j.a
11
the court explained that this led includes the following parts i the` leads' which are used to conduct the electrical current to the led_chip ; ii the` resin housing' which is made out of a reflective resin and includes a recess in which the led_chip is placed ; iii the` led_chip' or` led die' about the size of a grain of salt which is mounted in the recess typically by using an adhesive material in a process known as die_bonding ; iv one or more` bond wires' that connect the led_chip to the leads ; and v an` encapsulation_material' that encapsulates the led_chip and protects it from the environment
nichia 2016_wl_310142 at *4

the leds in suit are miniscule ; they are typically smaller than 1 millimeter in height
id
they are used in lcd backlights video displays automotive applications and general lighting applications
id

the court found that led_design technology is a complex technological space where many design considerations pull in different_directions simultaneously
it found that` led package design involves the simultaneous integration and balancing of multiple design considerations including electrical optical thermal and mechanical_design_challenges'
id
the court emphasized that [ m ] ultiple challenges must be addressed when de-signing an led package i electrical design challenges we have to conduct a relatively high-current density through the small led_chip and connect the led_chip to the leads ; ii optical design challenges the intensities are very high because the led_chip is very small and the power emitted by the led is quite high
and therefore we need to handle a very high-optical radiation density ; iii thermal design challenges the led_chip inevitably creates heat and this heat needs to be conducted *1333 away ; and iv mechanical_design_challenges includes protecting the led_chip from any external effect such as moisture or mechanical intrusion
these multiple requirements can be contradictory and can pull the design in different_directions

( internal emphases citations and quotations omitted

the district_court held a bench_trial and found that everlight infringed all three patents and had failed to prove by clear and convincing_evidence that the asserted claims of the three patents are invalid.1 id.at *1
despite finding the patents valid and infringed the court refused nichias request for prospective relief in the form of a permanent_injunction
id
the court explained that` nichia has not demonstrated that defendants past and continuing infringement of nichias patents has caused and will continue to cause irreparable_harm to nichia'
id
it also reasoned that monetary_damages could adequately compensate nichia for everlights infringement
the court thus concluded that nichia was not entitled to injunctive relief
id

nichia timely appealed and everlight cross-appealed
nichia appeals the district_courts refusal to grant the injunction
everlight cross-appeals the district_courts judgment that everlight infringes and that it failed to prove the patents invalid with respect to all of the asserted claims of nichias three asserted patents

a
we begin with the250_patent
the district_court found claims 1 7 17 19 and 21 of the patent infringed and not proven invalid
everlight first challenges the courts construction of the claim term` lead' and its finding of infringement under its proposed construction
second it challenges the courts construction of` planar' and the courts finding of infringement under either its proposed construction or the courts
finally everlight challenges the courts conclusion that it failed to prove the patent obvious

*1334 1
the250_patent is directed to a process for manufacturing leds that purportedly improves production_efficiency
the patent describes making a continuous sheet of leds and separating or` singulating' them to make the final product
'250_patent col. 2_ll._49 -53
during singulation leds often break
so to reduce breakage the patent suggests manufacturing leds by fitting a lead_frame between an upper and lower_mold filling the molds with resin and then singulating the leds
this the patent suggests is a` simple and low-cost method for manufacturing in a short time multiple light emitting devices which ha [ ve ] high adhesion between a lead_frame and a thermosetting resin composition'
id
the district_court noted that` [ b ] etween 2010_and_2013 nichias sales of the products that practice the250_patent increased from three percent of nichias total sales volume to 27 percent'
nichia 2016_wl_310142 at *24
the court also explained that` [ i ] n 2013 nichia sold over 13.9 billion units with revenues of $ 1.7 billion'
id

the250_patents first claim is reproduced below 1
a method of manufacturing a light emitting device the method comprising providing a lead_frame comprising at least one notch ; plating the lead_frame ; after plating the lead_frame providing an upper_mold on a first surface of the plated lead_frame and a lower_mold on a second surface of the plated lead_frame and transfer-molding a thermosetting resin containing a light reflecting material in a space between the upper_mold and the lower_mold to form a resin-molded body ; and
cutting the resin-molded body and the plated lead_frame along the at least one notch to form a resin_package the resin_package comprising a resin_part and at least one lead and the cutting step being performed such that an outer_surface of the resin_part and an outer_surface of the at least one lead are planar at an outer_side_surface of the resin_package wherein the plated lead_frame is cut so as to form an unplated outer_side_surface on the lead
'250_patent col. 19_ll._37 -55

2
everlight argues that the court misconstrued the term` lead' when it interpreted` lead' to mean` the portion of the device that conducts electricity'
j.a
10054-55
everlight contends that a lead must be more than simply conductive it must be` the conductive_portion of the device that makes an electrical connection to a structure outside of the device'
j.a
10054 originally proposing this construction
the district_court rejected everlights request to add a requirement that the lead electrically connect to a structure outside of the device because while the court` generally agree [ d ] with the conductive_portion of [ everlights ] construction' it found` the remaining language problematic and not as concise as the courts construction'
j.a
10056

we agree with the district_court that a lead as employed in the asserted claims of the250_patent is` the portion of the device that conducts electricity'
the specification discloses leads 22 in figure 1 *1335

?
'250_patent fig._1
the specification explains that` [ t ] he light emitting element 10 is electrically connected with the leads 22 through wires 50'
id.at_col. 6_ll._20 -21
it explains that the lead_frame` is formed using an electrical [ sic ] good conductor such as iron phosphor bronze or a copper alloy'
id.at_col. 9_ll._21 -22
these disclosures explain that the claimed leads conduct electricity
but we find no compelling support in the intrinsic_evidence for everlights proposed requirement that the leads conduct electricity from outside the device
we thus agree with the district_court that the person of ordinary_skill would understand a lead to be` the portion of the device that conducts electricity'

because we agree with the courts construction and because everlight does not challenge the courts finding of infringement under that construction we affirm the courts finding that the accused products meet this limitation

3
we next turn to everlights contention that the district_court misconstrued` planar' when it interpreted the term` planar' as` in a substantially same_plane'
j.a
10069
the250_patents claims require that` at least one lead [ be ] planar at an outer_side_surface of the resin_package'

everlight argues that` planar' means that there is` no measurable surface variation'
j.a
10068
everlight asserts that this construction is mandated by the specifications distinction between` planar' and` in the same_plane'
everlight_br
23
namely the patent uses` in a substantially same_plane' in the specification but` planar' in the claims
the specification states that` a resin_part and a lead are formed in a substantially same_plane in an outer_side_surface'
'250_patent col. 2_l._63 - col. 3_l._1
the claims however recite` an outer_surface of the resin_part and an outer_surface of the at least one lead are planar at an outer_side_surface'
id.at_col. 19_ll._50 -52 claim 1 emphasis added
everlight argues that the patent owners choice to use` in a substantially same_plane' in the specification but` planar' in the claims mandates that we treat the two terms differently

we disagree
first everlights argument implies a rule that we decline to adopt here namely that if different words are used in the claim and specification then we must read that distinction as an intended difference
we recognize that in some patents a distinction between terms *1336 may imply a difference in meaning but this is no hard-and-fast rule
rather some inventors might use one term in the specification to inform the meaning of another term in the claims
see sas inst. inc. v. complementsoft llc. 825_f.3d_1341 1348 fed
cir
2016
for one word to inform the meaning of another the words need not be identical
see id
for example in sas institute we held that the term` graphical representation of a data flow' in the claims and the term` data flow diagram' in the specification were commensurate in scope
id
so too here
reading the claims in light of the specification we conclude that the claimed term` planar' is commensurate in scope with the specifications discussion of` in a substantially same_plane'
we therefore agree with the courts conclusion that` planar' means` in a substantially same_plane'

because we agree with the courts construction we next consider everlights argument that it does not infringe even under that construction
everlight_br
23
everlight argues that` the outer_side_surfaces of the three package groups are notplanar because each of the outer_side_surfaces of the led_packages has a significant con-cave portion'
id.at 23-24 citing j.a
10347-57
everlight presents three cross-sectional views of the alleged infringing devices each showing two leads with flat sections connected by slight_concavities

we find everlights argument unconvincing
under the correct construction the leads need not be perfectly flat ; they need only be` in a substantially same_plane' as the outer_surface of the resin
the leads here are` in a substantially same_plane' as the outer_surface of the resin ; slight_concavities do not mandate a finding other-wise
we thus see no clear_error in the courts finding that everlights accused products infringe the` planar' limitation.2

4
everlight also argues it proved the250_patent invalid for obviousness despite the district_courts holding other-wise
specifically everlight asserts that the patent is rendered obvious by` hitachi' japanese_patent_pub
tokukai no._2 007-235085 in combination with` sanyo' japanese_patent_pub
tokukaihei 2011-191562 or` glenn' u.s._patent_no._6433,277

hitachi discloses a method for producing a semiconductor_device on a circuit board or lead_frame
nichia 2016_wl_310142 at *8
the district_court found that hitachi failed to disclose several elements of the250_patents claims
claim 1 requires a` notch' and` cutting the resin-molded body and the plated lead_frame along the at least one notch to form a resin_package'250_patent col. 19_ll._47 -48 claim 1 neither of which hitachi discloses
nichia 2016_wl_310142 at *17
these findings are supported by expert_testimony j.a
20797-98 schubert and by hitachi itself j.a
10249 fig._6 showing dicing lines 20
indeed hitachi is criticized in the250_patents specification for having a design that results in detachment of the packaging resin from the lead_frame during singulation
see250_patent col. 2_ll._18 -19 30-35 and fig._1 9 a reproduced from hitachi
the250_patent solves this problem by providing a manufacturing method and led_device in which the lead_frame has` notch [ es ]' and` the thermosetting resin is filled in the notch parts and therefore an adhering area between the lead_frame and *1337 the thermosetting resin becomes large so that it is possible to improve adhesion'
id.at_col. 3_ll._8 -12
we thus conclude that despite everlights arguments to the contrary these findings are not clearly erroneous

everlight argues that it would have been obvious to combine hitachi with glenn and sanyo to achieve the claimed invention
glenn discloses a method of making packages for integrated circuit dies
nichia 2016_wl_310142 at *19
sanyo is directed to a method for producing a semiconductor_device
id

the court found that a person of ordinary_skill would not have considered glenn or sanyo to modify hitachi because` the different considerations in the design and manufacture of electronic and optoelectronic [ e.g. led ] devices result in substantial differences in the manufacturing processes and materials used in the different technologies' and` a change in the design or manufacture of an led or other optoelectronic device requires the consideration of factors-including factors such as light emission and the effects of heat and emitted radiation on different resins and other materials-that are not relevant to the design and manufacture of electronic semiconductor_devices'
id.at *21

these findings are supported by expert_testimony including everlights experts admission that electronic device technology is not particularly relevant to led_technology
j.a
20543-44
because the weight of the evidence supports the courts finding that there was no motivation to combine these references we affirm the courts conclusion that everlight failed to prove that the250_patent would have been obvious

b
we next examine the870_patent
again everlight challenges the district_courts determination that it infringes and that it did not prove the patent obvious

1
the870_patent discloses an led_design that purportedly minimizes structural_problems caused by components expanding and contracting at different_rates during thermal_cycling
'870_patent col. 1_ll._38 -49
the design is a molded package with` a specific feature a wall_portion' that separates the positive and negative leads
nichia 2016_wl_310142 at *36 internal_quotation omitted
`` [ t ] his wall_portion improves structural integrity particularly if the device is subject to temperature variations so that package cracking detachment of the encapsulation_material and warping of the package is reduced or avoided'
id
( internal_quotation omitted
the package also includes a semiconductor such as a light emitting semiconductor
claim 7 is reproduced below 7
a light emitting device comprising a light emitting element ; a molded_member having a recess formed therein by a bottom_surface and a side_surface so as to mount said light emitting element in substantially a center of the recess ; a positive_lead_electrode partially disposed on the bottom_surface and adjacent to the side_surface in the recess and extending outwardly from said molded_member ; a negative_lead_electrode partially disposed on the bottom_surface and adjacent to the side_surface in the recess and extending outwardly from said molded_member ; means for electrically connecting said light emitting element to said positive_lead_electrode and said light emitting element to said negative_lead_electrode ; wherein a portion of said positive_lead_electrode and a portion of said negative_lead_electrode in the recess are separated from each other by a wall *1338 portion ; wherein said wall_portion extends inwardly in a direction toward the center of the recess
'870_patent col. 35_ll._22 -42

2
everlight argues that its products do not meet the870_patents requirement that its positive and negative_lead_electrodes are` partially disposed' on the bottom_surface of a recess
specifically everlight claims that the court wrongly defined the` bottom' of the recess in its products
the recesss bottom it argues extends to the uppermost extension of resin
this bottom is a flat line
everlight does not dispute however that shallow gaps in the resin expose the leads

the court repeatedly rejected everlights position and found the disputed element met
nichia 2016_wl_310142 at *39-48
in reaching this conclusion the court repeatedly credited nichias expert
see e.g. id.at *30
we discern no clear_error in the courts conclusion
but even more we find everlights position belied by the patent itself
the870_patent discloses several embodiments where the bottom of the recess is multi-featured
see e.g.870_patent figs
1 6 11
despite everlights claim to the contrary the recess is not flat
see id
the bottom of the recess then is also not flat
everlights straight-line recess oversimplifies the analysis-the recess need not be perfectly flat
in turn the court correctly concluded that everlights products infringe where the leads are exposed through gaps in the resin
everlights products include these gaps and thus the district_court properly concluded that the products meet this claim limitation
as everlight brings no other challenge on this issue we affirm the district_court as to everlights infringement of the870_patent

3
everlight also challenges the courts conclusion that it failed to prove the870_patent invalid
everlight had asserted that the ordinary artisan would have combined` waitl' u.s._patent_no._6624,491 and` nitta' u.s._patent_no._6747,293 to render the870_patent claims obvious
everlight first challenges the courts conclusion that waitl does not disclose all of the claim elements
it second challenges the courts conclusion that the artisan would not have looked to nitta to remedy waitls deficiencies

waitl notes that separation can result when different materials expand at different_rates so it teaches designs to help minimize separation
nichia 2016_wl_310142 at *49
entitled` diode housing' waitl` is directed to problems in the operation of a device stemming from delamination-a situation in which thewindow encapsulant material separates from the metal frame of the device'
id

waitls device includes a lead_electrode with a single exposed area id. but the claims require the lead_electrode to have two exposed portions one positive and one negative separated by a wall
the court found that waitl failed to disclose elements related to these positive and negative electrodes as claimed in the870_patent
everlight does not challenge the courts reading of waitl

everlight instead argues that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have been motivated to modify waitl in light of nitta to achieve the claimed invention
nitta appears to disclose a wall between two electrodes as it is directed to a light emitting device with a` plurality of chips efficiently disposed' in a housing with a` lead having a slit formed between a portion for bonding a wire to and a portion for mounting chips on thereby to prevent extrusion of *1339 an adhesive and eliminate defective bonding'
id.at *50 quoting nitta abstract

but the court found that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have had no motivation to modify nitta in light of waitl
we agree
the court found that the references disclose different_structures resolve dissimilar problems and propose dissimilar solutions
id.at *51-53
the courts conclusion derives further support from its earlier finding that artisans in this field face myriad design challenges because small design changes may cause unpredictable results and because design considerations often pull in multiple directions
id.at *4
we determine that the courts finding on motivation to combine is not clearly erroneous
we thus affirm the district_courts conclusion that everlight failed to prove the870_patent invalid as obvious

c. we now reach the589_patent the third and final patent nichia asserted against everlight
the court found everlight infringed claims 1_and_2 of the589_patent and that everlight had failed to prove the patent invalid
everlight again appeals the courts holdings on infringement and validity

1
the589_patent is also directed to the design of a semiconductor_device
the disclosed design seeks to prevent adhesive from overflowing into other_areas of the device
specifically the589_patent states that` an object of the present invention is to provide a semiconductor_device wherein the adhesive_components do not overflow nor leak to the wire_bonding_area even when.. adhesive_components having low surface tension [ are ] used in the adhesive_layer for die_bonding and the overflow and leak preventing function can be maintained satisfactorily even when the device is made smaller and thinner'
'589_patent col. 2_ll._60 -67
claim 1 of the589_patent requires the following 1
a semiconductor_device comprising a semiconductor_element having a pair of electrodes ; a housing having a recess for accommodating the semiconductor_element ; a first_lead_electrode and a second_lead_electrode exposed on the bottom_surface of said recess ; an adhesive_layer for die_bonding between the semiconductor_element and the first_lead_electrode ; and
electrically conductive wires for wire bonding between one electrode of the pair of electrodes of the semiconductor_element and the first_lead_electrode and between the other electrode and the second_lead_electrode ; wherein the housing has at least one wall formed to extend across the bottom_surface of the recess so as to divide the surface of the first_lead_electrode into a die_bonding area and a wire_bonding_area ; the first_lead_electrode has a notch which is formed by cutting off a portion of an edge of the first_lead_electrode and located at least just below the wall ; and
the wall and the bottom portion of said housing are connected to each other through the notch
id.at_col. 15_l._59 -col. 16_l._13

2
everlight challenges the courts finding that it infringes the589_patent with the same arguments that it made against its infringement of the870_patent
everlight_br
32-33
for the same reasons we affirmed the courts infringement finding with respect to the870_patent we affirm its finding of infringement with respect to the589_patent
see supra discussion b.2

*1340 3
everlight also challenges the courts conclusion that it did not prove the589_patent invalid by asserting that it would have been obvious to a person of ordinary_skill in light of` nakashima' u.s._patent_pub
no._2 004/0256706 and` kim' u.s._patent_pub
no._2 006/0170083

nakashima discloses` a molded package for an led_device that reduces the likelihood of delamination-that is detachment of the encapsulating resin from the package'
nichia 2016_wl_310142 at *32
the device has a circular recess and three exposed metal_members
id
the court found that nakashima failed to disclose a wall that divides the surface of a lead_electrode a notch in the lead and a few other claimed features
id.at *33

kim discloses a side-view led_designed to enhance the flow of resin into the side wall
id.at *34
kim explains that to achieve these dimensions` endeavors have been made to reduce the thickness of the upper and lower wall parts around an led window
however reducing the wall part thickness is an extremely difficult task
this task also potentially weakens wall strength thereby failing to ensure reliability'
id
( quoting kim ?
[ 0006 ]
the court found kim failed to meet several of the589_patents claimed features including having a wall across the bottom of the recess
id.at *34-35

the court also found that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would not have been motivated to combine nakashima and kim
specifically it found that the two references` are not directed to similar packages' and` describe different_structures'` kim relates to thin side-view leds while nakashima relates to a top-view led with a recess that includes three metal_members partially covered by a wall_portion'
id.at *35
moreover the court found that the two references` address different problems in packaging structures and disclose different solutions'` kim contemplates that the structure that promotes resin flow will be embedded in the body of the package itself' while` nakashima is concerned about delamination of the encapsulant material as a result of different coefficients of thermal expansion among the different package materials'
id
we conclude that these findings are not clearly erroneous and are supported by the weight of the evidence
see e.g. j.a
20785-86
we thus affirm the district_courts conclusion that one of ordinary_skill in the art would not have been motivated to combine these two references and thus the references did not render the589_patent obvious

ii
finally nichia challenges the district_courts decision to deny its request for permanent injunctive relief
the district_court held that nichia failed to show that it had suffered irreparable_harm and that remedies at law provided nichia inadequate compensation
nichia 2016_wl_310142 at *65-67
nichia challenges both conclusions
because we affirm the courts conclusion on irreparable_harm we do not reach the adequacy of monetary_damages

we review a district_courts grant or denial of a permanent_injunction for an abuse of discretion

b. nichia challenges the district_courts finding that it failed to establish that it will suffer irreparable_harm absent an injunction
the courts conclusion relied on several findings each weighing against nichia
specifically the court found that` [ t ] he record shows an absence of meaningful_competition'
nichia 2016_wl_310142 at *65
it found that nichia had` failed to establish past irreparable_harm or the likelihood of irreparable_harm in the future based on lost sales' or` based on price_erosion'
id.at *66
it found that nichias licensing of the patents to major competitors suggested that harm from` infringement *1342 of the patents-in-suit is not irreparable'
id
and it found that nichias licensing practices have made` multiple low-priced non-infringing alternatives from competitors available to replace the accused everlight products if such products were not available'
id
nichia contests these findings

nichia first argues that the court abused its discretion when it found a lack of` meaningful_competition' between the parties
nichia asserts that the court should have deferred to the parties stipulation that` nichia and everlight are competitors'
j.a
2112 ?
148
it further claims that the trial record` abounds' with everlight documents identifying nichia as a competitor
nichia br
34
it points to internal everlight documents identifying nichia as a competitor j.a
2222 2466-69 3007-08 and an everlight annual report identifying nichia as a` major competitor' j.a
2783-84 2788
and it argues that everlight stipulated that it targeted some of nichias customers with offers to sell infringing products
j.a
2113-14 ? ?
158-64
nichia contends that these showings undermine the district_courts finding that nichia and everlight are not meaningful competitors

nichia also argues that the court misunderstood the led_market
nichia claims that this market is a` design-win' market where customers require suppliers like everlight and nichia to` design-in' a product before receiving an order
j.a
20254-61 swenson ; j.a
20424 kammerer ; j.a
20304 liu` for the end customer there-there has to be some sort of design-in before theres an order
`` ; j.a
20315 liu` you-you have to get designed-in to be able to get an order`
during the` design in' process customers test and certify leds which leads to a reticence to substitute competing leds for the products life cycle
nichia argues that this characteristic of the led_market makes it likely that infringement will cause long-term irreparable_harm

we disagree not because we question the facts as nichia presents them but because the court heard these arguments as the original finder of fact and concluded to the contrary carefully weighing both parties evidence
the court found that nichia is an led_chip manufacturer as well as a packager` while everlight is solely an led packager'
nichia 2016_wl_310142 at *53
the court also found that the two companies generally sell to different parties` everlight generally sells to distributors rather than directly to customers as nichia does'
id
moreover despite the parties stipulation that they competed in the same market j.a
2112 ?
148 the court found that nichia failed to prove that this competition was meaningful nichia 2016_wl_310142 at *65
the court explained that everlights competition accounted for` the proverbialdrop in the bucket` when compared to nichias total sales
id
nichia identified 516 sales opportunities with everlight as a competitor in only 3
id
in light of these findings the court noted that there was` a very small area of possible competition' but it concluded that there was an` absence of actual competition'
id
the court closed its market-competition analysis by observing that the` justification for an injunction is remote indeed'
id

the court also disagreed with nichias contention that it would suffer future irreparable_harm because of past lost sales
id.at *66
the court found that nichia` failed to establish that [ everlight was ] responsible for causing a single_lost_sale in the u.s.' id
nichia claimed one in-stance of a lost sale but the court concluded that the evidence showed` several other formidable lower-priced and licensed competitors for the same opportunity'
id
additionally nichias expert` admitted he *1343 made no attempt to establishbut for causation that nichia america would have made the sale.. in the absence of everlights claimed infringement'
id
in short nichia did not prove that it had suffered even a single_lost_sale from everlights infringement

nichia also had alleged that it suffered price_erosion because of everlights infringement in a sale to general electric
while nichia eventually won the ge contract it sold its products at a price lower than it originally offered
j.a
20266-69
nichia presented evidence that it had lowered its price to compete against everlights infringement and that this infringement caused this price_erosion

the court disagreed
nichia 2016_wl_310142 at *66
it explained that nichias lower-price sale to ge had been required by ge so` nichia was going to have to lower its prices regardless of everlights competition'
id
further the court found that several licensed competitors had offered products at lower_prices independent of everlight which drove down prices
the court further pointed to nichias admission that it had already sold leds at the lower_price to ges competitors in the same period and that this lower_price made it` impossible to maintain' a higher price with ge
id
and the court credited nichias experts admission that the evidence was insufficient to establish price_erosion and that he did not attempt a price-erosion analysis
the court concluded that in light of these evidentiary deficiencies nichia` can not establish that everlight was thebut for cause of its claimed price_erosion'
id
we find no clear_error in the courts finding that nichia failed to establish price_erosion from everlights infringement

nichia further contests the courts findings with respect to nichias licensing_activities
nichia argues that the court wrongly found that its licensing_activities precluded a finding of irreparable_harm
nichia argues that the courts decision is contrary to settled law as it applies a categorical_rule that licenses preclude irreparable_harm

to the extent the court adopted a categorical_rule we agree with nichia ; such a rule would run afoul of our precedent
we have explained for example that` [ a ] plaintiffs past willingness to license its patent is not sufficient per se to establish lack of irreparable_harm if a new_infringer were licensed'
acumed llc v. stryker corp. 551_f.3d_1323 1328 fed
cir
2008 citing ebay 547 u.s. at 393 126_s.ct._1837

but to the extent that the court found that nichias prior licenses weighed against a finding of irreparable_harm we countenance that approach
while evidence of licensing_activities can not establish a lack of irreparable_harm per se that evidence can carry weight in the irreparable-harm inquiry
we have previously explained that` [ t ] he fact of the grant of previous licenses the identity of the past licensees the experience in the market since the licenses were granted and the identity of the new_infringer all may affect the district_courts discretionary decision concerning whether a reasonable royalty from an infringer constitutes damages adequate to compensate for the infringement'
id
the courts findings on licensing traversed these considerations
the court found that several of nichias licenses were to` significant competitors' who posed` major threats' to nichias flagship products
nichia 2016_wl_310142 at *66
and the court found that these licenses changed the market by making available` multiple low-priced non-infringing alternatives'
id
these findings the court concluded supported a finding that` nichia ha [ d ] failed to establish it will suffer irreparable *1344 harm in the absence of an injunction'
id

in any event regardless of the courts analysis of the licenses we note that the court treated nichias licenses as an independent ground for denying the injunction
id
it did not rely on nichias licenses in its earlier analysis of irreparable_harm but rather found the licenses to further bolster its prior finding
id
the courts licensing analysis thus does not undermine its separate findings that nichia failed to establish market competition lost sales and price_erosion and that these failures all weigh against a conclusion that nichia would suffer irreparable_harm absent an injunction
id

we discern no clear_error in the district_courts finding that nichia failed to prove that it would suffer irreparable_harm absent the injunction
on that traditional equitable factor nichia did not bear its burden
see w._t._grant_co. 345 u.s. at 633 73_s.ct._894
because nichia failed to establish one of the four equitable_factors the court did not abuse its discretion in denying nichias request for an injunction

conclusion
we discern no error in the courts conclusions that everlight infringed all asserted claims and failed to prove those claims invalid by clear and convincing_evidence
we also conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying nichias request for a permanent_injunction
we therefore affirm

affirmed
