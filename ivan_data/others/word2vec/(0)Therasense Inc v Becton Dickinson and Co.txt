linn circuit_judge
abbott_diabetes_care inc. and abbott_laboratories collectively` abbott' appeal the final decision of the u.s. district court for the northern_district of california which entered judgment in accordance with a jury_verdict that claims 11_and_12 of abbotts u.s._patent_no._5628,890` the ¡¬ 890 patent' are infringed by becton dickinson & co. and nova biomedical corp. collectively` bd/nova' but are invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡±¡± 102 103 and 112 ?

therasense inc. v. becton dickinson & co. no._04- cv-2123 n.d.cal
sept._2,_2008
although judgment was entered in favor of bd/nova on all counts relating to the ¡¬890_patent bd/nova cross-appeals the jurys underlying finding that it infringes claims 11_and_12
because we conclude that the district_court did not err in denying abbotts post-trial motions on invalidity and because we lack jurisdiction over bd/novas cross-appeal we dismiss the cross-appeal and affirm the judgment

background
the ¡¬890_patent is directed to electrochemical_sensors for measuring glucose_levels in blood
a droplet of blood is placed on a disposable test strip that has two electrodes a` working_electrode' and a` counter_electrode'
the working_electrode is coated with an enzyme and a mediator
the enzyme serves as a catalyst to facilitate a chemical reaction in which the glucose_molecules in the blood sample lose some of their electrons and the mediator then transfers those electrons to the working_electrode
as the electrons flow through the working_electrode an electrical_current is detected
the magnitude of the electrical_current can then be correlated to the concentration of glucose_molecules in the blood
the electrons are then brought back into the blood through the counter_electrode
to complete this circuit the blood must be in contact with both electrodes at the same time

a problem occurs however if the blood only partially covers the working_electrode
for example if too little blood is *1329 supplied or if the test strip is not held in a horizontal position the blood may not fully cover the working_electrode resulting in the production of fewer free electrons
because fewer electrons will flow between the two electrodes the sensor will report an erroneously low_glucose_level
based on this false reading a patient may fail to take insulin when he should or the patient may consume carbohydrates when he should not

the inventors of the ¡¬890_patent sought to solve this problem known in the art as the` short_fill' problem by placing the counter_electrode on the downstream_side of the working_electrode
when the electrodes are arranged in this manner the blood necessarily makes contact with the working_electrode before it makes contact with the counter_electrode
this arrangement helps to ensure that a circuit is not completed and that no measurement is taken until the working_electrode is fully covered with blood

claim 11 of the ¡¬890_patent is directed to this` downstream' embodiment
it recites with key term emphasized 11
an electrode strip for use in an electrochemical sensor for measuring a compound in a sample comprising an elongated electrode_support defining a sample_transfer_path for directional_flow of the sample from an application_point along said electrode_support ; a reference or counter_electrode in said sample_transfer_path ; and
a covering layer defining an enclosed space over the sample_transfer_path the reference or counter_electrode and said working_electrode said covering layer having an aperture for receiving sample into said enclosed space ; said aperture spaced away from and upstream of said electrodes in said sample_transfer_path and said reference or counter_electrode spaced downstream of said working_electrode in said sample_transfer_path
claim 12 depends from claim 11 and adds a requirement that the counter_electrode is spaced downstream of` any portion' of the working_electrode

abbott accused bd/nova of infringing claims 11_and_12 of the ¡¬890_patent by making using and selling a product called bd tm test strips.1 bd/nova denied infringement and asserted that claims 11_and_12 are invalid under ¡±¡± 102 103 and 112 ?
1
more specifically under ¡±¡± 102_and_103 bd/nova asserted that claims 11_and_12 are anticipated or rendered obvious in light of two prior_art_references u.s._patent_no._5120,420` nankai' and u.s._patent_no._5582,697` ikeda'

following briefing and a markman hearing the district_court construed the contested terms in the asserted claims as follows 1` sample_transfer_path' means` the route along which the sample moves' ; 2` directional_flow' means` the orientation and guidance in a particular_direction' ; 3` defining a sample_transfer_path for directional_flow' means` providing a channel for the sample to move in a particular_direction from the application_point to and including the electrodes' ; and 4` aperture' means` an opening'
j.a
5908-09

*1330 a jury_trial was held from july_15,_2008 to august 8 2008
the jury using a special verdict form found that bd/nova infringed claims 11_and_12 under the doctrine of equivalents noting in particular that the` aperture' and` electrode_support' limitations were present in bd tm test strips as equivalents
the jury also found that claims 11_and_12 were invalid
more specifically the jury checked` yes' in response to the question` have defendants proven by clear and convincing_evidence that claims 11_and_12 of the ¡¬890_patent are invalid by reason of anticipation or obviousness ?'
the jury also checked` yes' in response to the question` have defendants proven by clear and convincing_evidence that claims 11_and_12 of the ¡¬890_patent are invalid by reason of inadequate written description ?'
in accordance with this verdict the district_court entered judgment in favor of bd/nova and against abbott on all counts relating to the ¡¬890_patent
on september 2 2008 the district_court denied abbotts post-trial motions for jmol and for new_trial

abbott appeals the judgment that claims 11_and_12 are invalid
bd/nova filed a cross-appeal with regard to the jurys finding that bd tm test strips infringe claims 11_and_12
bd/nova subsequently moved this court to treat its argument in support of its cross-appeal as an alternative_argument in support of affirmance
we have jurisdiction over abbotts appeal under 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1 2006

discussion
i. abbotts appeal
abbott challenges the district_courts denial of its motions for jmol and for new_trial
`` this court reviews the denial of a motion for jmol or a new_trial under the law of the regional circuit where the district_court sits..' voda v. cordis corp. 536_f.3d_1311 1318 fed.cir.2008
the ninth circuit reviews a district_courts denial of a motion for jmol de novo and the denial of a motion for new_trial for abuse of discretion
in re first alliance mortg co. 471_f.3d_977 991 9th cir.2006
`` jmol should be granted only if the verdict is against the great weight of the evidence or it is quite clear that the jury has reached a seriously erroneous result'

`` a new_trial is proper only if the verdict is contrary to the clear weight of the evidence or is based upon evidence which is false or to prevent in the sound discretion of the trial court a miscarriage of justice'
id
( internal_quotations omitted

in contesting the district_courts denial of its post-trial motions abbott seeks to overturn the jurys two verdicts of` anticipation or obviousness' and` inadequate written description'

a
`` anticipation or obviousness' the jury answered` yes' to the question` have defendants proven by clear and convincing_evidence that claims 11_and_12 of the ¡¬890_patent are invalid by reason of anticipation or obviousness ?'
abbott contends that this verdict is a general_verdict encompassing separate legal theories of anticipation and obviousness and that the verdict must be reversed or a new_trial granted if any legal_theory is legally flawed or is unsupported by substantial_evidence
in particular abbott believes that the district_courts jury_instruction on the law of anticipation was erroneous and that the jury could not have found the claims obvious under either of bd/novas two obviousness contentions

`` a jury_verdict will be set aside based on erroneous jury_instructions if the movant can establish thatthose instructions *1331 were legally erroneous and thatthe errors had prejudicial_effect

legal error
`` the question of whether a jury_instruction on an issue of patent law is erroneous is a matter of federal circuit law and is reviewed de novo'
id
`` in reviewing jury_instructions the full trial record and the jury_instructions in their entirety must be examined becauseinstructions take on meaning from the context of what happened at trial including how the parties tried the case and their arguments to the jury

the district_court instructed the jury on the law of anticipation as follows for anticipation it is not enough that all of the elements could have been found among two or more references
if at the time of the patent application a single prior-art_reference already described all of the elements of the claimed invention and would have informed those skilled in the art that those elements could have been arranged as in the claimed invention then the prior-art_reference is deemed to` anticipate' the claimed invention and thereby render it unpatentable and thus invalid
it would not be enough however that all of the elements were in random passages in the reference
by the same token for anticipation to apply it is not necessary that the prior-art_reference expressly lay out the elements in the exact_way laid out in the claim
rather for anticipation it is sufficient if the single_reference would have informed those skilled in the art that all of the claimed elements could have been arranged as in the claimed invention
j.a
5912 emphases added

the district_court then instructed the jury on how it should apply the law of anticipation to the prior_art nankai_reference for anticipation to apply nankai did not have to discuss the subject of shortfill
rather what matters is whether or not nankais specification and figures would have informed those of ordinary_skill in the art that the claimed combination could have been arranged as in the claimed invention in suit
if nankai did not do so then it did not anticipate
if nankai did so then it did anticipate
it would not matter that it was subsequently discovered that the arrangement in question was also useful in solving the shortfill problem
what is already in the public domain does not become patentable merely because a new use for a known approach is discovered
j.a
5912 emphasis added

over abbotts objection these instructions were read to the jury and a copy was made available in the jury room
after three days of deliberation the jury sent a note to the trial judge requesting clarification on the law of anticipation
the note read in deciding whether anticipation applies do we have to show that it was highly probable that a person of ordinary_skill would arrive at the 890 combination ?
or do we have to show it was highly probable that they could come up with the 890 combination ?
j.a
10394-95
the district_court declined to expand on its instruction and instead reread to the jury its instruction on the *1332 law of anticipation
an hour later the jury reached its verdict of invalidity

on appeal abbott argues as it did below that anticipation requires a single_prior_art_reference to disclose exactly the same claim_elements in exactly the same_way as they are arranged in the claim
abbott therefore takes issue with the district_courts instruction that` it is not necessary that the prior-art_reference expressly lay out the elements in the exact_way laid out in the claim'
in response bd/nova focuses on the word` expressly' in this sentence and argues that the instruction is correct because a prior_art_reference may disclose each claim_element either expressly or inherently
but the instruction does not go on to explain the concept of inherency
instead immediately following the sentence discussing what is` not necessary' for anticipation the instruction states` rather for anticipation it is sufficient if the single_reference would have informed those skilled in the art that all of the claimed elements could have been arranged as in the claimed invention'
j.a
5912 emphases added
we agree with abbott therefore that when read in its entirety the instruction is incorrect because it makes sufficient for purposes of anticipation a prior_art disclosure of individual claim_elements that` could have been arranged' in a way that is not itself described or depicted in the anticipatory_reference

the way in which the elements are arranged or combined in the claim must itself be disclosed either expressly or inherently in an anticipatory_reference
`` anticipation requires the presence in a single prior_art disclosure of all elements of a claimed invention arranged as in the claim'
connell v. sears roebuck & co. 722_f.2d_1542 1548 fed.cir.1983
the requirement that the prior_art elements themselves be` arranged as in the claim' means that claims can not be` treated.. as mere catalogs of separate parts in disregard of the part-to-part relationships set forth in the claims and that give the claims their meaning'
lindemann maschinenfabrik gmbh v. am
hoist & derrick co. 730_f.2d_1452 1459 fed.cir.1984
`` [ u ] nless a reference discloses within the four corners of the document not only all of the limitations claimed but also all of the limitations arranged or combined in the same_way as recited in the claim it can not be said to prove prior invention of the thing claimed and thus can not anticipate under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102'
net moneyin inc. v. verisign inc. 545_f.3d_1359 1371 fed.cir.2008 emphasis added

the concept of` inherent_disclosure' does not alter the requirement that all elements must be disclosed in an anticipatory_reference in the same_way as they are arranged or combined in the claim
`` [ a ] nticipation by inherent_disclosure is appropriate only when the reference discloses prior_art that must necessarily include the unstated limitation..' transclean corp. v. bridgewood servs. inc. 290_f.3d_1364 1373 fed.cir.2002
`` inherency however may not be established by probabilities or possibilities

( quoting in re robertson 169_f.3d_743 745 fed.cir.1999
for a claim to be anticipated each claim_element must be disclosed either expressly or inherently in a single_prior_art_reference *1333 and the claimed arrangement or combination of those elements must also be disclosed either expressly or inherently in that same prior_art_reference

because the district_courts instruction on the law of anticipation was legally erroneous we must next determine whether the error may have prejudiced the jurys verdict of` anticipation or obviousness'

prejudicial effect
`` when the error in a jury_instructioncould not have changed the result the erroneous_instruction is harmless` and will be upheld
sulzer 358 f.3d at 1364 quoting environ prods. inc. v. furon co. 215_f.3d_1261 1266-67 fed.cir.2000 ; weinar v. rollform inc. 744_f.2d_797 808 fed.cir.1984` where the procedural error washarmless i.e. where the evidence in support of the verdict was so overwhelming that the same_verdict would necessarily be reached absent the error or the error was cured by an instruction a new_trial would be mere waste and affirmance of the judgment is required
``

the only` result' that may have been prejudiced in this case was the jurys affirmative response to the question` have defendants proven by clear and convincing_evidence that claims 11_and_12 of the ¡¬890_patent are invalid by reason of anticipation or obviousness ?'
because anticipation and obviousness were presented together in the same jury question it is impossible for us to know which of the two legal theories the jury relied on to invalidate the claims
however an erroneous_instruction on the law of anticipation could not have changed the result in this case if claims 11_and_12 would have been obvious as a matter of law such that no reasonable_jury could have returned a verdict that the claims are not obvious
cf agrizap inc. v. woodstream corp. 520_f.3d_1337 1342 1344 fed.cir.2008 holding claims obvious as a matter of law where patentee was` fully heard on an issue during a jury_trial and the court finds that a reasonable_jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue' citing fed.r.civ.p
50 a
for the reasons that follow we conclude that the same_verdict of` anticipation or obviousness' would necessarily be reached absent the error because claims 11_and_12 would have been obvious over the nankai_reference as a matter of law

as a preliminary matter abbott argues that bd/novas theory of obviousness in which nankai was asserted alone as a single_reference was not properly before the jury
according to abbott this particular contention was not identified prior to trial and was not raised until after the close of all non-damages evidence and thus abbott did not have the opportunity to be fully heard on this issue
in abbotts view bd/nova relied exclusively on nankai in combination with ikeda

abbott is incorrect
in its final invalidity contentions submitted prior to trial bd/nova asserted in separate paragraphs that nankai and ikeda each` renders the asserted claims of the ¡¬890_patent invalid under ¡±¡± 102_and_103' and provided separate claim charts for the two references showing where each claim_element is disclosed in that reference
j.a
13100-02 nankai claim chart 13114-17 ikeda claim chart
at least with regard to independent claim 11 the claim chart of nankai did not cite to or rely on any additional reference and abbott does not separately argue the patentability of dependent claim 12 on appeal
in the parties joint pretrial order bd/novas second affirmative defense states` the ¡¬890_patent is anticipated or rendered obvious in light of u.s._patent_no._5120,420 to nankai et al
and/or u.s._patent_no._5582,697 to ikeda et al'
j.a
13486 emphasis added
*1334 these were the only two prior_art_references being asserted against the claims
in the jury_instruction pertaining to obviousness the district_court specifically instructed the jury to consider` whether the nankai_reference standing alone or in combination with other prior_art rendered the claimed invention obvious as of the date of invention'
j.a
5915 emphasis added
finally in overruling abbotts objection to the inclusion of this contention in the jury_instruction the district_court remarked that` ive seen the way the lawyers tried this case and there could be no possible prejudice.. because nankai has been beaten to death in this case by both sides'
j.a
9820-21 1859:24-1860:2
having reviewed the record we agree with the district_court that abbott received adequate notice of this obviousness contention prior to trial and that the contention was squarely presented to the jury

because we conclude that abbott was fully heard on the issue of whether nankai alone renders the claims obvious we must next determine whether the evidence was sufficient for the jury to have possibly found in abbotts favor

figure 12 of nankai reproduced below shows an exploded view of a sensor in which fluid is introduced through introducing port 10 and is rapidly drawn along three channels 8 towards discharge_ports 11 12 13 from which air is discharged out of the channels
while following the paths of the three channels the fluid encounters three separate working_electrodes 41 42 43 and a counter_electrode 5 that is shared by all three working_electrodes
as shown below counter_electrode 5 is on the downstream_side of working_electrodes 41 42 43 relative to introducing port 10

fig._12
?
*1335 abbott does not dispute that figure 12 of nankai shows all but two elements of the asserted claims` directional_flow' and` said covering layer having an aperture for receiving sample'
as for` directional_flow' because it is difficult to know beforehand which of the three channels 8 the fluid will fill up first abbott contends that the fluid does not move in a` particular_direction' as required by the district_courts construction of` directional_flow'
in abbotts view if the fluid fills the rightmost_channel first then the counter_electrode will be upstream not downstream of working_electrodes 41_and_42 ; alternatively if the fluid fills the middle_channel first then the counter_electrode will be upstream not downstream of working_electrodes 41_and_43

but abbotts argument goes to the scope of its claims not the content of the prior_art
the claims require only that a single counter_electrode be spaced downstream of a single working_electrode` said reference or counter_electrode spaced downstream of said working_electrode'
while the open-ended transitional phrase` comprising' allows for additional working_electrodes to be present in the claimed invention it is sufficient for purposes of the` downstream' limitation if the counter_electrode is located downstream of only a single` said' working_electrode
hence if the fluid fills the rightmost_channel first then the` downstream' limitation is satisfied because counter_electrode 5 is located downstream of working_electrode 43
the same is true if the fluid fills the middle_channel first since counter_electrode 5 would then be located downstream of working_electrode 42
thus regardless of which channel the fluid fills up first in nankai the fluid will necessarily encounter at least one working_electrode before reaching the counter_electrode
in addition as part of the claim construction that was submitted to the jury which abbott does not challenge the district_court made clear that` a channel could have a right-angle turn or curved turn and that would still be directional'
j.a
5909
moreover` directional_flow' is measured` from the application_point to and including the electrodes'
j.a
5909
as applied to nankai` directional_flow' occurs along a particular_direction within a given channel beginning at the introducing port 10 and ending at the channels respective discharge_port 11 12 or 13 and will necessarily encounter the channels respective electrode 41 42 or 43 along the way
there can be no dispute that` directional_flow' is present

the second disputed limitation-' said covering layer having an aperture for receiving sample' -is allegedly absent from nankai because in abbotts view the introducing port 10 of figure 12 is located on the side of the sensor rather than in the cover 9
abbott notes that the cover 9 only contains discharge_ports 11 12 13 from which air is drawn out of the channels not where fluid is introduced
however abbott overlooks the fact that an aperture-in-cover arrangement is disclosed in nankai itself for example in figure 13 which shows an introducing port 10 and discharge_ports 11 12 located in the same cover 9 with the introducing port spaced upstream of both the discharge_ports and the electrodes below
nankai states that` in the examples the same numbering is used for common_elements'
nankai col.4 ll.38-39
this statement provides an express teaching to look to other drawings in nankai for common_elements having the same number such as the two covers numbered` 9' in figures 12_and_13
nankai also teaches in reference to all disclosed embodiments that` [ t ] he discharge_port may be used as the introducing port and the introducing port may be used as the discharge_port'
id
col.12 ll.28-31
this too provides an unambiguous *1336 teaching that introducing ports and discharge_ports are interchangeable such that fluid may be introduced through the ports in the cover rather than on the side
indeed abbott itself concedes that moving an aperture on the cover is an` insubstantial' or` obvious' difference
reply br
of pls.-appellants 11` although everyone agrees that moving the aperture is an insubstantial_difference it is enough to defeat anticipation
`` ; id
31` [ t ] here is no dispute that moving the aperture was obvious ; both experts agreed that it was an insubstantial_difference
``

abbotts final argument against a verdict of obviousness is that the claimed invention solved the so-called` short_fill' problem a problem for which abbott submits there was a long-felt but unsolved need but one which nankai does not solve
we accept as we must abbotts contention that short-fill occurs in nankai if only two channels are filled with blood and if no current is detected in the third channel
under such conditions the sensor of nankai would report an erroneously low_glucose_level when it averages all three current measurements
but again abbott overlooks the fact that the claims are not limited to sensors that prevent short-fill
the relevant claim limitation recites` said reference or counter_electrode spaced downstream of said working_electrode'
abbott does not dispute that the fluid in nankais figure 12 will reach at least one working_electrode 41 42 or 43 before it reaches counter_electrode 5 regardless of which channel the fluid fills up first
thus nankais counter_electrode is` downstream' of at least one working_electrode
because the claims are broad enough to cover devices that either do or do not solve the` short_fill' problem abbotts objective evidence of non-obviousness fails because it is not` commensurate in scope with the claims which the evidence is offered to support'
in re grasselli 713_f.2d_731 743 fed.cir.1983 ; see also in re kubin 561_f.3d_1351 1356 fed.cir.2009` [ t ] he obviousness inquiry requires this court to review the boards decision that the claimed sequence not appellants unclaimed cloning technique is obvious in light of the abundant prior_art'
( emphases added

for the foregoing reasons we conclude that the asserted claims would have been obvious over nankai as a matter of law
because the jury could not have returned a different verdict the district_courts erroneous_instruction on the law of anticipation could not have changed the result
similarly because the jury must at least have found the claims obvious we need not decide whether mere` substantial_evidence' supports the alternative legal_theory of anticipation which is mere evidence that might support a verdict of anticipation
see syufy enter
v. am
multicinema inc. 793_f.2d_990 1001 9th cir.1986 stating the general rule that a new_trial is required where the jury reaches a general_verdict encompassing alternative legal theories one of which is unsupported by` substantial_evidence' ; see also consol edison co. v. nlrb 305_u.s._197 229 59_s.ct._206 83_l.ed._126_(1938) defining` substantial_evidence' as` such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion' emphasis added
nor is a remand required on the alternative factual basis asserted in support of the legal_theory of obviousness namely nankai in combination with ikeda where as here the legal conclusion of obviousness is compelled on at least one asserted factual basis namely nankai alone
see mccord v. maguire 873_f.2d_1271 1273-74 9th cir.1989` when a general_verdict may have rested on factual allegations unsupported by substantial_evidence we will uphold the verdict *1337 if the evidence is sufficient with respect to any of the allegations
``

* * * in sum we hold that claims 11_and_12 would have been obvious over nankai as a matter of law
the erroneous jury_instruction on the law of anticipation could not have changed the verdict of` anticipation or obviousness' and obviousness based on nankai alone is sufficient to support that verdict as a matter of law

b
`` inadequate written description' the jury returned a verdict that claims 11_and_12 are invalid based on` inadequate written description' independently of its verdict of` anticipation or obviousness'
having affirmed the judgment under the latter we need not reach abbotts challenge to the former

ii
bd/novas cross-appeal
despite the fact that judgment was entered in favor of bd/nova on all counts relating to the ¡¬890_patent bd/nova filed a cross-appeal against the jurys finding that the accused product satisfies the` aperture' limitation under the doctrine of equivalents

as our decision in bailey v. dart container corp. of michigan 292_f.3d_1360_(fed.cir.2002) makes clear` [ i ] t is only necessary and appropriate to file a cross-appeal when a party seeks to enlarge its own rights under the judgment or to lessen the rights of its adversary under the judgment'
id.at 1362
thus a cross-appeal is proper only when` acceptance of the argument it wishes to advance would result in a reversal or modification of the judgment rather than an affirmance'

`` where as here the district_court has entered a judgment of invalidity as to all of the asserted claims there is no basis for a cross-appeal as to either 1 additional claims for invalidity or 2 claims of non-infringement'
typeright keyboard corp. v. microsoft corp. 374_f.3d_1151 1157 fed.cir.2004 emphasis added
bd/novas cross-appeal falls squarely within this second category

accordingly we dismiss the cross-appeal and strike the surreply brief
because of concerns that its cross-appeal was improper bd/nova filed a motion to treat its argument in support of its cross-appeal as an alternative_argument in support of affirmance
having affirmed the judgment of invalidity on the merits we decline to reach the alternative_argument of non-infringement

conclusion
we lack jurisdiction over bd/novas cross-appeal
the judgment that claims 11_and_12 of the ¡¬890_patent are invalid is

affirmed

costs
each party shall bear its own costs
