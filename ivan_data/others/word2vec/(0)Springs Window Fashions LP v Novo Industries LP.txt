bryson circuit_judge
springs_window_fashions l.p. shade-o-matic_ltd. and manor_tec inc. collectively` springs' appeal from an order of the united_states_district_court for the western_district of wisconsin granting the motion of novo_industries l.p. for summary_judgment of noninfringement of united states patent no._6178,857` the ¡¬857_patent`
novo cross-appeals the grant of summary_judgment dismissing its counterclaims of tortious_interference and disparagement based on bad_faith_enforcement of the ¡¬857_patent
we affirm the summary_judgment as to both the claim of infringement and the counterclaims of tortious_interference and disparagement

i
the ¡¬857_patent which was assigned to shade-o-matic and then licensed to *992 springs_window_fashions relates to a method of trimming window_blinds
because windows vary in size there is a benefit to being able to customize the window_blinds
while a retail_store could order custom-sized blinds from a factory another approach is for the retail_store to order stock_sizes of blinds and cut them to the appropriate size at the time of purchase
manufacturers such as springs provide retail_stores with both the stock_sizes of blinds and` cut-down' machines that can trim the head_rail slats and bottom_rail of window_blinds
the ¡¬857_patent recites a method used in connection with such a cut-down machine

independent claim 1 of the ¡¬857_patent is the only independent claim
it provides 1
a method of trimming the width of venetian blinds of the type having a head_rail a plurality of slats and a bottom_rail each of said head_rail said slats and said bottom_rail having first and second opposed ends said method comprising the steps of placing a first_end of said head_rail of said venetian blind through a corresponding head_rail opening in a support_body and placing a first_end of said bottom_rail and a first_end of said slats through respective_openings in said support_body whereby respective first_ends of said head_rails said bottom_rail and said slats extend through said openings ; moving said first_ends of said head_rails said bottom_rail and said blind_slats through said openings in said support_body and into respective aligned further openings in a cutting_means said cutting_means including a first_cutter for cutting said head_rail and a separate_second_cutter for cutting at least said slats ; and moving said first and second cutters to cut at least said head_rail and said slats
¡¬857_patent col._12,_l._66 to col._13,_l._18 emphasis added
one of the embodiments illustrated in the specification uses a die_plate that slides diagonally to cut the head_rail and a blade mounting frame that moves horizontally to cut the slats
see ¡¬857_patent figures 1-7

on july_16,_2001 springs filed suit charging novo with infringing claims 1 2 8 and 10 of the ¡¬857_patent through the manufacture and sale of cut-down machines that employ the claimed methods
in novos accused device a single_plate with multiple blades cuts the head_rail bottom_rail and slats
the plate has a series of openings for the rails and slats and it has blades that correspond to the openings
when the plate is moved the blades cut the rails and slats
novo moved for summary_judgment arguing that its device did not employ` separate' cutters within the meaning of the asserted claims

the district_court granted novos motion
the court construed the term` separate' to mean capable of independent_movement
the court rejected springss contention that` separate' means simply different cutting surfaces
springss construction according to the district_court would render the term` separate' superfluous in the phrase` separate_second_cutter' in light of the presence of the word` second'
instead the court looked to dictionary definitions of the term` separate' including` detached disconnected or disjoined' to conclude that the cutters must` have the potential for independent_movement'
the court further held that the specification and prosecution_history of the ¡¬857_patent confirmed that the inventor intended to limit the claimed invention *993 to detached and independently moveable cutters

in light of that claim_construction the district_court held that there was no genuine_issue of material_fact as to whether novos machines infringed because novos device did not have two cutters that were moveable independently of one another
instead the blades in the novo machine were all attached to the same plate and when that plate moved so did all the blades

ii
springs argues that the district_court erred in its claim_construction and therefore erred in granting summary_judgment to novo
according to springs the term` separate' does not require the cutters to be independently movable but only requires that the machine have distinct cutting edges
thus in springss view the term` separate' distinguishes the claimed cutting_means from a single unbroken cutting edge that cuts the head_rail and then the slats

while the claim_language and specification may only allow rather than dictate the courts construction of the term` separate' the prosecution_history of the ¡¬857_patent confirms that the district_courts interpretation is correct
in the first official action the examiner rejected all of the original claims on several grounds including that they were either anticipated by or obvious in light of u.s. patent no._5816,126 to pluber
the pluber_patent claims a device in which three blades are mounted on one sliding support plate which is moved by a lever
the head_rail slats and the bottom_rail are cut by these three blades simultaneously as part of a single motion
the examiner explained that
pluber discloses the same invention [ as applicant ] a method of trimming the width of venetian blinds as claimed including the steps of placing a selected end of the head_rail bottom_rail and the blind_slats through corresponding.. slat openings in a support_body.. ; placing the selected ends of the head_rail bottom_rail and the blind_slats through aligned corresponding openings in a cutting_means.. ; moving the cutting_means to cut the head_rail bottom_rail and blind_slats

the applicant submitted an amendment modifying the claims distinguishing pluber from the claimed invention and arguing that pluber was not prior_art because it postdated the grandparent application
the applicants accompanying remarks noted that extra effort is required to cut the head_rail because of its steel construction
the applicant stated` it is for this reason that the applicant provides two entirely separate_movement means one for cutting the head_rail and the other for cutting the bottom_rail and the blind_slats'
in amending claim 1 the applicant replaced the language` a cutting_means' with` a cutting_means said cutting_means including a first_cutter for cutting said head_rail and a separate_second_cutter for cutting at least said slats'
the applicant also modified the specification to include the language` with the cutting stroke of the bottom_rail and the blind_slats be [ ing ] performed independently of the cutting stroke of the headrail cutting_means'

in distinguishing the ¡¬857 claims from the pluber_patent the applicant stated pluber discloses a somewhat simplistic form of guillotine cutter
all of the blades are mounted on a single_plate.. operated by a single arm 55
the single_plate 22 carries three blades one for cutting the head_rail one for cutting the blind_slats and one for cutting the bottom_rail.. pluber does not provide two separate_cutters for cutting 1 the *994 blind_slats and bottom_rail and 2 the head_rail
operation of pluber would require a very considerable manual effort
he shows only one movement arm
this has to move all three cutting blades..
the present invention has been devised to avoid this problem by providing one cutter for the head_rail and a separate cutter for the bottom_rail and slats

in the second official action the examiner continued to reject claim 1 and the other claims as anticipated by the pluber_patent or obvious in light of it
the examiner rejected the applicants contention that pluber lacked two separate_cutters noting that` [ e ] ach of the cutters.. are separably mounted to the plate 22 and separately cut a portion of the blinds
therefore the phrase a first_cutter.. and a separate_second_cutter does not distinguish the instant application from the pluber_reference even though the cutters.. are all mounted to the single_plate 22'

in response to that office action the applicant argued that pluber was not a prior_art_reference
in addition the applicant adhered to his argument distinguishing his invention from pluber applicant maintains the arguments set forth in the prior amendment concerning distinguishing of pluber from the claims previously presented on the merits
however in light of the examiners concession that claim 1 finds full support in the application filed september 11 1995 it is not believed necessary to go any further than to point out that fact and request a notice of allowance
the examiner issued a notice of allowance without further comment

it is well established that` the prosecution_history limits the interpretation of claim terms so as to exclude any interpretation that was disclaimed during prosecution'
pall corp. v. pti techs inc. 259_f.3d_1383 1392 59_uspq2d_1763 1769 fed.cir.2001 ; southwall tech. inc. v. cardinal ig co. 54_f.3d_1570 1576 34_uspq2d_1673 1676 fed.cir.1995 ; see also ekchian v. home depot inc. 104_f.3d_1299 1304 41_uspq2d_1364 1368 fed.cir.1997` [ b ] y distinguishing the claimed invention over prior_art an applicant is indicating what the claims do not cover he is by implication surrendering such protection`
the disclaimer however must be effected with` reasonable clarity and deliberateness'
n. telecom ltd. v. samsung elecs co. 215_f.3d_1281 1294 55_uspq2d_1065 1075 fed.cir.2000

springs concedes that the applicant amended the claims to include the word` separate' in an effort to distinguish the invention from pluber
we agree with the district_court that in distinguishing pluber the applicant disclaimed a single_plate with multiple blades or cutting edges on that single_plate
the applicant specifically noted that the claimed method provided` separate_movement means' thus restricting` separate' cutters to those cutters capable of independent_movement

the district_court correctly stated that novos single_plate with attached blades is` similar to the blade configuration of the preferred embodiment in pluber'
given that the pluber_reference and novos device are nearly identical with respect to the arrangement of their cutting edges it is clear that the applicant disclaimed coverage of novos device

springs contends that the examiner did not agree that the amended claims distinguished over pluber and that the claims therefore should not be limited based on the applicants argument that they did
springs argues that the examiner allowed the claims based on an entirely distinct rationale that pluber was not prior_art
*995 in fact it is not clear from the record why the examiner allowed the claims
while the examiner expressed doubt in the second office action that the amended language of the claims was sufficient to distinguish over pluber it is not clear that the examiner adhered to that position at the time of allowance
the notice of allowance offers no explanation of the examiners reasoning

in any event the examiners remarks do not negate the effect of the applicants disclaimer
in desper_products inc. v. qsound labs inc. 157_f.3d_1325 1336 48_uspq2d_1088 1096 fed.cir.1998 when the applicant amended the claims and made accompanying remarks to overcome a rejection based on another patent we stated that the fact that` the prosecution shifted to a different focus does not blunt the impact of those remarks made to overcome the prior rejection'
see also laitram corp. v. morehouse indus. inc. 143_f.3d_1456 1462 46_uspq2d_1609 1614 fed.cir.1998` regardless of the examiners motives arguments made during prosecution shed light on what the applicant meant by its various terms..
the fact that an examiner placed no reliance on an applicants statement distinguishing prior_art does not mean that the statement is inconsequential for purposes of claim_construction`
because an examiner has the duty to police claim_language by giving it the broadest reasonable interpretation see in re hyatt 211_f.3d_1367 1372 54_uspq2d_1664 1667 fed.cir.2000 it is not surprising that an examiner would not be satisfied with the applicants insistence that particular claim_language distinguishes a prior_art_reference but that a court would later hold the patentee to the distinction he pressed during prosecution

the public notice function of a patent and its prosecution_history requires that a patentee be held to what he declares during the prosecution of his patent
a patentee may not state during prosecution that the claims do not cover a particular device and then change position and later sue a party who makes that same device for infringement
`` the prosecution_history constitutes a public_record of the patentees representations concerning the scope and the meaning of the claims and competitors are entitled to rely on those representations when ascertaining the degree of lawful conduct..
were we to accept [ the patentees ] position we would undercut the publics reliance on a statement that was in the public_record and upon which reasonable_competitors formed their business strategies'
hockerson-halberstadt inc. v. avia group int l inc. 222_f.3d_951 957 55_uspq2d_1487 1491 fed.cir.2000
see also vitronics corp. v. conceptronic inc. 90_f.3d_1576 1583 39_uspq2d_1573 1577 fed.cir.1996` the claims specification and file history.. constitute the public_record of the patentees claim a record on which the public is entitled to rely'
in this case a reasonable_competitor reviewing the amendments and statements made by the applicant to distinguish the claimed invention from pluber would conclude that the claimed invention did not cover a device like plubers
if the applicant mistakenly disclaimed coverage of the claimed invention then the applicant should have amended the file to reflect the error as the applicant is the party in the best position to do so
the applicant however never retracted any of his statements distinguishing pluber nor did he acquiesce in the examiners comments regarding the overlapping scope of pluber
springs therefore must be held to the restrictive claim_construction that was argued during prosecution

we are also unpersuaded by springss argument that the statements *996 made during prosecution should be disregarded because the distinguishing features` were not and are not reflected in the claims' and thus the statements simply constituted an error by the prosecuting attorney that should not be binding on the applicant
here as in hockerson-halberstadt there is no indication that the detailed distinction of pluber was simply an inadvertent misstatement by the prosecuting attorney for which the applicant should be given a mulligan
the statements distinguishing pluber were detailed consistent and repeated
a reasonable_competitor would have believed that the applicants disclaiming statements were not a mere mistake
this case is thus distinguishable from biotec biologische naturverpackungen gmbh & co. kg v. biocorp inc. 249_f.3d_1341 1348 58_uspq2d_1737 1741-42 fed.cir.2001 in which the court held that` a person of reasonable intelligence would not be misled into relying on [ an ] erroneous statement' made during prosecution because the statement was contrary to the plain language of the claims and specification as well as other statements in the same document
as in desper_products we are interpreting claim_language not importing limitations into the claim
there is nothing in the prosecuting attorneys remarks that is at odds with anything in the specification or the claims

lastly springs contends that the district_courts claim_construction had the effect of excluding one of the embodiments in the ¡¬857_patent illustrated in figures 8_through_10 and thus can not be correct
the district_court however concluded that the embodiment was consistent with its construction requiring capacity for independent_movement
the court stated that the use of the word` synchronism' in the specification to describe this embodiment` implies a capacity for independent_movement since that term is generally applied only to independently movable members that are compelled to move coincidentally'
the court thus determined that the embodiment in figures 8_through_10 discloses` independently movable cutters though they are configured to move sequentially in response to a single manual control'

we reject springss argument that figures 8_through_10 require a claim_construction different from that employed by the district_court
first we have adopted claim_constructions excluding an embodiment when the prosecution_history requires the claim_construction because of disclaimer
see rheox inc. v. entact inc. 276_f.3d_1319 1327 61_uspq2d_1368 1373-74 fed.cir.2002
second we agree with the district_court that the construction of the term` separate' to mean independently moveable does not exclude the embodiment in figures 8_through_10
the lost motion linkage in that embodiment causes the two cutters to move sequentially the head_rail is first cut and then after the arm rotates further the slats are cut thus providing a mechanical advantage
one could move the handle some distance to cause the die_plate to move and cut the head_rail stop pushing the handle and thus not move the blade and not cut the slats
in each of the remaining embodiments the cutters are unconnected and independently moveable

because the patentee explicitly stated during prosecution that his claims differed from a single_plate with multiple cutting edges we construe the disputed claims to exclude the disclaimed single_plate_device
based on that construction we uphold the district_courts grant of summary_judgment of noninfringement and denial of summary_judgment of infringement

iii
novo argues that the district_court erred in dismissing its counterclaims for *997 tortious_interference and disparagement
in those counterclaims novo alleged that springs made wrongful accusations of infringement against novo to novos prospective and current customers and that springs was either aware of or acted with reckless disregard for the noninfringement or unenforceability of the ¡¬857_patent
the counterclaims required proof of bad_faith_enforcement of the patent see zenith elecs corp. v. exzec inc. 182_f.3d_1340 1353 51_uspq2d_1337 1347 fed.cir.1999 and the district_court concluded that novo failed to raise a genuine_issue of material_fact with regard to that issue

a
during the summary_judgment proceedings novo requested a continuance pursuant to rule 56 f of the federal rules of civil procedure in part for the purpose of obtaining deposition evidence from representatives of springs_window_fashions
according to novo the district_court abused its discretion when it denied novos request for a rule 56 f continuance
we disagree

rule 56 f permits a nonmoving party to submit an affidavit requesting a continuance if further_discovery is required to oppose a motion for summary_judgment
on such discovery issues this court applies the law of the regional circuit
vivid techs. inc. v. am
sci
& eng g inc. 200_f.3d_795 807 53_uspq2d_1289 1297 fed.cir.1999
the seventh circuit employs the abuse of discretion standard in reviewing a district_courts decision to deny a partys rule 56 f motion
see kalis v. colgate-palmolive co. 231_f.3d_1049_(7th_cir.2000)
novo argues that the district_court erred when it entered summary_judgment on the counterclaims before the completion of discovery and before novo was able to conduct its noticed deposition

the district_court entered its order dismissing novos counterclaims for tortious_interference and disparagement on march_8,_2002
the court denied novos rule 56 f request because the court concluded that novo had failed to pursue its counterclaims diligently and that there was no reason to believe any pending discovery would reveal evidence of springss bad_faith
the court found that` [ p ] laintiffs asserted a plausible interpretation of the patent supported by opinion of counsel which plaintiff appears to have genuinely embraced'
in addition the court noted that novo` amended its complaint to add the counterclaims although it could readily have asserted them in its original_answer
it has not proceeded promptly to pursue discovery of the issue'
in sum the court concluded that` [ c ] onsidering the unlikelihood that additional discovery will expose anything to keep these counterclaims alive and defendants limited pursuit of the claims to date there is no justification for a rule 56 f continuance'

the district_court did not abuse its discretion in finding that novo was not diligent in its pursuit of the counterclaims and that novo therefore did not establish its entitlement to a continuance
`` when a party fails to secure discoverable evidence due to his own lack of diligence it is not an abuse of discretion for the trial_court to refuse to grant a continuance to obtain such information'
kalis 231 f.3d at 1058 quoting pfeil v. rogers 757_f.2d_850 857 7th_cir.1985
in this case novo failed to proceed with diligence first in filing the counterclaims and then in pursuing discovery including scheduling the deposition at issue

novo filed its original_answer on august 10 2001 but waited until december 28 2001 to file a motion for leave to amend its *998 answer and add the counterclaims of tortious_interference and disparagement even though novo has conceded that it had knowledge of facts sufficient to plead the counterclaims as early as september 26 2001
the three-month delay is not insignificant especially considering the fact that discovery was scheduled to be completed less than three months after novo filed its motion for leave to amend
it is inconsequential whether the district_court erred in finding that novo could have asserted the counterclaims in the original_answer filed in august ; novo concedes that it could have done so at least as early as september 26 2001

additionally by september 6 2001 novo was aware that the court expected all motions for summary_judgment to be filed no later than february 1 2002 and for responses to be filed within 20 days thereafter
thus although discovery was not scheduled to close until march_15,_2002 novo was on notice that if springs chose to move for summary_judgment on the counterclaims novo would have to be prepared to respond by february 21
while novo deposed shade-o-matics representatives on february 20 the earliest date that novo scheduled springs_window_fashions deposition was march 1
thus even though springs moved for summary_judgment on february 1 2002 and novos response to that motion was due on february 21 novo did not schedule the springs_window_fashions_deposition in time to incorporate that deposition into its response
novo blames springs_window_fashions for novos failure to complete the deposition in time because springs_window_fashions rescheduled the march 1 deposition for the week of march 11
however the real cause of novos inability to incorporate the deposition results in its response to the summary_judgment_motion was its own conduct in scheduling the deposition so late in the first place
while it is unfortunate that springs did not give the opinion of counsel_letter to novo in response to document requests and waited until march 4 to produce it novo was not without blame in failing to discover pertinent_evidence in a timely manner

furthermore` [ a ] party who has been dilatory in discovery may not use rule 56 f to gain a continuance where he has only made vague assertions that further_discovery would develop genuine_issues of material_fact'
united states v. bob stofer oldsmobile-cadillac inc. 766_f.2d_1147 1153 7th_cir.1985
see also farmer v. brennan 81_f.3d_1444 1449 7th cir.1996` this court has noted that the party seeking further time to respond to a summary_judgment_motion must give an adequate explanation to the court of the reasons why the extension is necessary`
novo fails to explain what reasonable basis it has to believe that the deposition or other discovery efforts in that remaining week would have led to evidence of bad_faith on the part of springs_window_fashions
novo has offered nothing to support a reasonable belief that the deposition would have led to damaging admissions regarding the counterclaims
none of the other discovery conducted by novo including a deposition of shade-o-matic had produced any such admissions or other evidence of bad_faith

novo contends that the information it needed to answer the summary_judgment_motion was solely in the possession of springs because it went to state of mind
novo now argues that the springs_window_fashions_deposition was important in part because it would have revealed the timing of the opinion of counsel_letter relative to springss contacts with novos customers
but there were other sources for some of that information including the customers themselves
not all of the information *999 noted by novo was within the exclusive control of springs yet there is no evidence in the record that novo sought to obtain or succeeded in obtaining such evidence from its customers

accordingly we conclude that the trial_court did not abuse its discretion by denying the request for a continuance to allow further_discovery before ruling on the motion for summary_judgment on the counterclaims

b
as to the merits of the grant of summary_judgment novo argues that there was a genuine_issue of material_fact on the issue of bad_faith
novo relies on a license_agreement between shade-o-matic and novo and allegations of inequitable_conduct in contesting the grant of summary_judgment
we reject both elements of novos argument and conclude that the evidence before the district_court negated rather than supported bad_faith

the law` recognizes a presumption that the assertion of a duly granted patent is made in good faith.. ; this presumption is overcome only by affirmative_evidence of bad_faith'
golan v. pingel enter. inc. 310_f.3d_1360 1371 64_uspq2d_1911 1918 fed.cir.2002 citations omitted
to avoid summary_judgment a party claiming bad_faith patent enforcement` must present affirmative_evidence sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that the patentee acted in bad_faith in light of the burden of clear and convincing_evidence that will adhere at trial'
id
novo failed to meet its burden of putting forward affirmative_evidence of bad_faith

the evidence negating bad_faith includes a june 2001 opinion letter procured by springs that supports springss claim that novo infringed the ¡¬857_patent
the district_court correctly determined that` all evidence indicates that plaintiffs genuinely believed that their proposed interpretation of the patent was correct and that defendant was infringing'
the district_court did not have before it any evidence to the contrary

novo contends that springs should have known that the ¡¬857_patent might be covered by a license_agreement between shade-o-matic and novo when springs communicated with the customers and that the evidence of the license raises a genuine_issue of fact of springss bad_faith
novo asks us to infer that springs believed the license_agreement included the ¡¬857_patent and covered the alleged infringing activity
the pertinent_evidence however points away from that inference
first the ¡¬857_patent appears to claim a method that applies to horizontal and not vertical blinds while the license appears to limit itself to the cutting of vertical_blinds including vertical tracks and vanes
even though the specification of the ¡¬857_patent does discuss how the invention may be used on vertical_blinds the specification also notes that vertical_blinds do not contain a bottom_rail
novo concedes that this is true
claim 1 of the ¡¬857_patent however includes the limitations of` placing a first_end of said bottom_rail.. through respective_openings' and` moving.. said bottom_rail'
novo fails to raise a genuine_issue regarding whether the ¡¬857_patent covers the cutting of vertical_blinds and thus whether the patent is included under the license
second there was no evidence that anyone believed the license_agreement covered the cutting of horizontal blinds
shade-o-matics representative stated in his deposition that he believed that the license covered only vertical_blinds
novos corporate representative stated in his deposition that he understood the licensing agreement to cover vertical cut-down machines and said he had no *1000 belief as to whether it also covered horizontal cut-down machines stating that` [ i ] ts just not real clear'
with regard to whether the agreement included the ¡¬857_patent he stated that he did not` have a belief one way or the other
its just unclear to me'
in the face of evidence that novos representative did not have an affirmative belief that the license covered the ¡¬857_patent novo asserts that a reasonable fact-finder could conclude that springs had such a belief
that assertion however is unsupported by evidence and the district_court therefore properly entered summary_judgment against novo on that issue

novo also contends that it has raised a genuine_issue of material_fact regarding springss bad_faith_enforcement of the patent through its allegations that springs knew the ¡¬857 was unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct
again we disagree
we have stated that a` threshold showing of incorrectness or falsity or disregard for either is required in order to find bad_faith' in a threat to enforce patent rights
mikohn gaming corp. v. acres gaming inc. 165_f.3d_891 897 49_uspq2d_1308 1312 fed.cir.1998
see golan 310 f.3d at 1371 64 uspq2d at 1918` [ i ] f the party challenging such statements.. presents clear and convincing_evidence that the infringement allegations are objectively false and that the patent made them in bad_faith viz. with knowledge of their incorrectness or falsity or disregard for either the statements are actionable and are not protected by the existence of a patent`
we conclude that novo has not raised a genuine_issue of fact on the issue of unenforceability and thus has not satisfied the threshold requirement for showing bad_faith
in september 2001 the district_court dismissed novos counterclaim of inequitable_conduct and in january 2002 the court denied novos attempts to add inequitable_conduct as a defense
additionally the court struck from the record novos expert report as it related to inequitable_conduct
novo thus has failed to point to any evidence in the record that raises a genuine_issue of material_fact as to inequitable_conduct sufficient to make the ¡¬857_patent unenforceable and raise an issue as to novos bad_faith

we conclude that novo presented no evidence that would support a finding that springs knew that it was enforcing an unenforceable patent or that springs had no reason to believe that novo did not infringe the ¡¬857_patent
therefore we affirm the district_courts grant of summary_judgment to springs on novos counterclaims of tortious_interference and disparagement

each party shall bear its own costs for this appeal
