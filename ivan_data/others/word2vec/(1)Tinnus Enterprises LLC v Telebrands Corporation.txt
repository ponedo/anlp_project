opinion
this is an appeal from the grant of a preliminary_injunction
the united_states_district_court for the eastern_district of texas ruled for the patentee tinnus_enterprises llc and entered a preliminary_injunction barring telebrands_corporation from selling its accused product balloon_bonanza or any colorable imitation thereof
telebrands alleges that the district_court abused its discretion by concluding that 1 the asserted claims were likely infringed ; 2 the claims were not vulnerable on indefiniteness or obviousness grounds ; and 3 tinnus made a showing of irreparable_harm
for the reasons stated below we disagree with telebrands and affirm the district_courts grant of a preliminary_injunction

background
tinnus_enterprises llc produces a toy for filling water_balloons covered by *1195 u.s. patent no._9051,066 which it calls` bunch_o_balloons'
telebrands_corporation sells a competing product` balloon_bonanza'
both products attach to a hose and fill multiple_water_balloons at once by channeling the water into the balloons through a set of hollow_tubes
a side-by-side comparison of the rival products is shown below ?
appellee br

tinnus and zuru ltd.1 collectively` tinnus' sued telebrands and bed_bath & beyond inc. collectively` telebrands' for infringement of the066_patent and subsequently moved for a preliminary_injunction
the magistrate_judge issued a report and recommendation` r & r' in which he recommended granting tinnuss motion

dec. 2 2015
shortly thereafter the patent trial and appeal board instituted a post-grant review proceeding for the066_patent finding all claims were more likely than not invalid based on the same arguments considered by the district_court

i
the066_patent
the066_patent relates to a system and method for simultaneously filling multiple_containers with fluid
'066_patent col. 1_ll._19 -21
one application of the066_patent is the mass-filling of water_balloons as shown in the embodiment depicted in figure 1 *1196

?
this embodiment includes a housing 12 with two ends end a is removably attached to a fluid_source e.g. hose 14 and end b is attached to a plurality of hollow_tubes 16
id
col. 2_ll._35 -37
a plurality of containers 18-in this instance balloons-are clamped to the tubes 16 using elastic_valves 20 which can include elastic_fasteners such as o-rings
id
col. 2_ll._51 -59
the patent refers to the force applied by the elastic_valves to keep the containers attached to the tubes as the` connecting force'
id
col. 3_ll._52 -64
once the fluid_source is turned on multiple_balloons are filled simultaneously fluid flows from hose 14 through the housing 12 and into the containers 18 through the tubes 16
id
col. 3_ll._41 -42

the066_patent teaches three ways to overcome the connecting force such that the containers detach from the tubes
these include 1 pulling the containers away from the tubes id
col. 3_ll._48 -51 ; 2 shaking the device to overcome the connecting force holding the containers to the tubes id
col. 3_ll._52 -57 ; and 3 allowing the containers to fall off due to gravity id
col. 3_ll._65 -67
after being detached from the tubes using any of the above-described methods the elastic valve constricts and seals the balloon
id
col. 4_ll._64 -67

independent claim 1 is illustrative and it recites *1197 1
an apparatus comprising a housing comprising an opening at a first end and a plurality of holes extending through a common_face of the housing at a second_end ; a plurality of flexible hollow_tubes each hollow tube attached to the housing at a respective one of the holes at the second_end of the housing ; a plurality of containers each container removably attached to a respective one of the hollow_tubes ; and
a plurality of elastic_fasteners each elastic_fastener clamping a respective one of the plurality of containers to a corresponding_hollow_tube and each elastic_fastener configured to provide a connecting force that is not less than a weight of one of the containers when substantially filled with water and to automatically seal its respective one of the plurality of containers upon detaching the container from its corresponding_hollow_tube such that shaking the hollow_tubes in a state in which the containers are substantially filled with water_overcomes the connecting force and causes the containers to detach from the hollow_tubes thereby causing the elastic_fasteners to automatically seal the containers wherein the apparatus is configured to fill the containers substantially simultaneously with a fluid
id
col. 6_ll._30 -53 emphasis added to indicate disputed limitations

ii
district court proceedings
tinnus filed its patent_infringement_suit against telebrands on the day the066_patent issued and filed a motion for a preliminary_injunction nine days later
the magistrate_judge reviewed the briefing and held a hearing to evaluate evidence on the preliminary_injunction factors before recommending that tinnuss motion be granted

in his infringement_analysis the magistrate_judge reviewed tinnuss claim_chart which mapped the claim_limitations onto the balloon_bonanza_product
the claim_chart explained why each limitation was met and included photographs of the allegedly infringing product images from the product instruction_manual screenshots of the product and related product videos
telebrands countered that its product did not infringe because its tubes can slide in and out of the housing and therefore are not` attached' to the housing as required by the claims
relying on the plain and ordinary_meaning of` attached' -' connected or joined to something' -the magistrate_judge concluded that the` tubes of the balloon_bonanza_product are connected to the housing holes in order for the product to function properly'
magistrate op. 2015_wl_11089479 at *4
telebrands also asserted that disputes over the meaning of` not less than' in conjunction with the term` connecting force' meant that the elastic_fastener limitation was not met.2 the magistrate_judge however found that this argument was actually premised on telebrands contention that shaking is not required to detach the balloons from the tubes in the balloon_bonanza_product
because the balloon_bonanza manual instructs the user to` [ t ] urn off water and give balloons a shake to release' id
( alteration in original quoting j.a
447 the magistrate_judge concluded that balloon_bonanza likely met the disputed limitation regardless of how it construed` connecting force' or` not less than'

the magistrate_judge also found that telebrands indefiniteness and enablement arguments failed to raise a substantial *1198 question of validity
first telebrands contended that the term` substantially filled' was indefinite because it required subjectivity in determining when the container had become substantially filled
the magistrate_judge disagreed noting that there is no per se rule that the term` substantially' is indefinite
the magistrate_judge further identified` specific_parameters' in the claims describing how to determine whether a container is substantially filled-for example` when thewater_overcomes the connecting force and causes the containers to detach from the hollow_tubes
`` id.at *5 quoting066_patent col. 6_ll._48 -52
second telebrands alleged that the term` connecting force' was not enabled because the066_patent never describes the type of force where the connecting force is not less than the weight of the container i.e. when the container will not detach from the tube
the magistrate_judge disagreed because claim 1 itself recites a shaking limitation for detaching the containers when the connecting force is not less than the weight of the containers when substantially filled with water which was consistent with the teachings in the specification

next telebrands argued that claim 1 was obvious over u.s. patent no._5826,803` cooper' in view of u.s. patent publication no._2013 /0118640` saggio' as well as cooper in view of saggio and u.s. patent publication no._2005 /0004430` lee'3 cooper discloses a garden sprinkler as shown in figure 4 below that attaches to a garden hose and has multiple bendable tubes 18
'803_patent col. 2_ll._22 -28 col. 3_ll._19 -23. ?
saggio teaches a system shown in figure 7 below that fills multiple tie-less water_balloons simultaneously using a one-way valve as depicted in figure 5 reproduced below
when water flows into the balloon through channel 20 the water pressure pushes seal 16 and inner membrane 18 up against the outer wall of the balloon 12 thereby locking in the water and preventing it from escaping
j.a
741
*1199

?
lee discloses a method and apparatus for endoscopically inserting a balloon into a persons stomach to treat obesity
j.a
753
as shown in figure 6 a balloon is attached to the inner_guide_pipe 3 using a rubber_band 2 with a high elastic force that stably binds the balloon to the inner_guide_pipe when it is expanded
j.a
754
the outer guide pipe 4 can slide forward towards the balloon once the endoscope and balloon are properly placed inside the stomach which pushes the rubber_band off of inner_guide_pipe 3 and seals the balloon
id
*1200

?

the magistrate_judge found the combination of cooper and saggio deficient because neither reference disclosed the required` elastic_fasteners'
the combination of cooper and saggio with lee fared no better because the magistrate_judge found no evidence that lees rubber_band would provide the claimed connecting force
moreover the magistrate_judge was not convinced that a person of ordinary_skill in the art` posa' would have been motivated to combine lee with cooper and saggio because the references come from diverse fields endoscopic balloon insertion devices for obesity treatment garden sprinklers and water balloon filling systems respectively
finally even if telebrands were able to establish a prima facie case of obviousness the magistrate_judge noted that secondary considerations such as commercial_success and copying would be relevant because the balloon_bonanza_product appeared to be` a near identical replica' of the patented_bunch_o_balloons_product
magistrate op. 2015_wl_11089479 at *7

with respect to irreparable_harm the magistrate_judge found evidence of price_erosion consumer_confusion reputational_harm and loss of goodwill based on customer calls emails and online reviews
as evidence of price_erosion the magistrate_judge explained that while zuru initially sold bunch_o_balloons for $ 17 in august 2014 in response to direct competition from balloon_bonanza zuru reduced the price of bunch_o_balloons to $ 12.99 and eventually to $ 9.99 by mid-2015
according to the magistrate_judge the` market entry and continually reduced sale prices of telebrands allegedly infringing product has driven down the price at which the bunch_o_balloons_product has sold' leading to the` harm that is ultimately irreparable here' in the form of the` now lowered price of sale for the present monopoly right'

cir
2013` where two companies are in competition against one another the patentee suffers the harm-often *1201 irreparable-of being forced to compete against products that incorporate and infringe its own patented inventions
``

to establish consumer_confusion reputational_harm and loss of good will tinnus provided evidence of conversations and reviews from confused customers
for example the magistrate_judge cited evidence that one customer called zuru to inquire about her product order when in fact the customer had purchased balloon_bonanza instead and that another customer left a review online stating` the inventor of the balloon_bonanza who invented this product was formerly called bunch_o_balloons'
id
customers also sent emails to tinnus asking whether balloon_bonanza was invented by mr. malone tinnuss founder and wondering whether he had licensed his invention to telebrands
this evidence convinced the magistrate_judge that consumers were confused about which product is sold by which company and that the patented_bunch_o_balloons_product had` been diluted in the minds of the consuming public'
id
aside from the consumer_confusion the false association between the products harmed tinnus because bunch_o_balloons received better ratings than balloon_bonanza on amazon.com and toysrus.com
even though most of these examples pre-dated the issuance of the066_patent the magistrate_judge found that several of the harms including customer confusion were ongoing

the magistrate_judge also concluded that the balance of hardships and public interest factors weighed in tinnuss favor due to the relative size of the parties and the strong public interest in enforcing valid patents
because tinnus established all four factors required for a preliminary_injunction the magistrate_judge recommended granting tinnuss motion

telebrands timely filed its objections to the magistrate_judges r & r alleging that it erred 1 by failing to provide a claim_construction for the` attached'` connecting force'` elastic_fastener' and` shaking' limitations ; 2 by improperly shifting the burden of proof to telebrands on infringement and invalidity ; and 3 by relying on insufficient evidence to support findings of commercial_success and copying.4 notably telebrands did not object to the magistrate_judges indefiniteness ruling or its rejection of telebrands obviousness_arguments
the district_court overruled each of the objections adopted the r & rs findings and entered a preliminary_injunction

iii
ptab proceedings
operating in parallel to the district_court proceeding was telebrands pgr petition seeking to invalidate the066_patent
the ptab relying on the same evidence and arguments before the district_court instituted review on all claims of the066_patent shortly after the district_court granted tinnuss request for a preliminary_injunction.5

the ptab found that claim 1s` shake-to-detach' *1202 feature6 was likely indefinite because the specification and prior_art both fail to provide` any objective standard for measuring the scope offilled orsubstantially filled` and the specification sets forth no limit on the amount of shaking needed to detach a filled container from the tube
institution_decision 2016_wl_270152 at *7-8.7 the ptab also found that a combination of cooper saggio and lee would likely render claim 1 obvious
id.at *14
according to the ptab a posa would have combined saggio with cooper to create a multi-balloon filling assembly by` attach [ ing ] balloons to the ends of the flexible tubes of coopers sprinkler' and would have added lees mechanism for clamping and sealing the balloons once filled because it was` reasonably pertinent to a particular_problem the inventor of the066_patent was trying to solve'

`` a decision to grant or deny a preliminary_injunction is within the sound discretion of the district_court based upon its assessment of four factors 1 the likelihood of the patentees success on the merits ; 2 irreparable_harm if the injunction is not granted ; 3 the balance of hardships between the parties ; and 4 the public interest'

patent infringement
on appeal telebrands first faults the district_court for failing to construe the terms` not less than' and` connecting force'
telebrands also alleges clear_error in the district_courts conclusions that the balloon_bonanza tubes are` attached' to the housing and meet the shake to detach limitation
for the reasons explained below none of these arguments are persuasive

an infringement_analysis involves the two-step process of` construing the claims and comparing the properly construed claims to the accused product'

see astrazeneca lp v. apotex inc. 633_f.3d_1042 1056 fed
cir
2010

contrary to telebrands argument the r & r which was adopted by the district_court did not refuse to construe the terms` not less than' and` connecting force'
instead the r & r acknowledged telebrands disagreement regarding those terms but concluded that tinnus was likely to succeed on its infringement_claim` irrespective of the interpretation of these claim_terms'
magistrate op. 2015_wl_11089479 at *4
the r & r reached this conclusion because it found that telebrands claim *1204 construction argument hinged on the contention that shaking is not required to detach the balloons from the tubes
because the balloon_bonanza instruction_manual tells users to` [ t ] urn off water and give balloons a shake to release' id
( alteration in original the magistrate_judge determined that telebrands position conflicted with the record evidence and failed to demonstrate that tinnus was unlikely to succeed on its infringement_claim
it was not clear_error for the district_court to adopt this finding

next telebrands challenges the district_courts application of the claim_term` attached' to the balloon_bonanza_product because its tubes allegedly` do not connect or join to the housing but rather slide in and out of the holes in the common_face of the housing'
appellant_br
24-25
the r & r applied the plain and ordinary_meaning for the term` attached' i.e.` connected or joined to something' and found that the balloon_bonanza_products tubes must be` connected to' the housings holes in order for it to function properly
magistrate op. 2015_wl_11089479 at *4 citing merriam-webster dictionary https //www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/attached last visited dec._19,_2016
this must be so according to the r & r because the housing accepts water from the hose at one end and sends the water through the holes at the other end which are connected to hollow_tubes for filling the balloons
the r & rs analysis of the` attached' limitation is reasonable and the district_courts adoption of it does not constitute clear_error

finally telebrands alleges that each claim_limitation must be found in the accused product itself and that it was clear_error for the magistrate_judge to rely on balloon_bonanzas instruction_manual to satisfy the shaking limitation
we disagree
the instructions for the balloon_bonanza_product are at least circumstantial_evidence of infringement for any claim elements taught by those materials
a patentee is entitled to rely on circumstantial_evidence to establish infringement` if [ defendant ] is arguing that proof of inducing infringement or direct_infringement requires direct as opposed to circumstantial_evidence we must disagree
it is hornbook law that direct evidence of a fact is not necessary'

cir
2001
telebrands contends that the magistrate_judge improperly shifted the burden of proving invalidity to telebrands rather than requiring tinnus to establish a likelihood of success in proving the patents validity
this argument is not compelling

each issued patent carries with it a presumption of validity under 35 u.s.c.¡± 282
titan tire 566 f.3d at 1376-77
this presumption is sufficient to establish a likelihood of success on the validity_issue absent a challenge by the accused infringer
id.at 1377
where the alleged_infringer attacks the validity of the patent` the burden is on the challenger to come forward with evidence of invalidity' which the patentee must then rebut
id.at 1377-78
`` [ i ] f the trial court concludes there is asubstantial_question concerning the validity of the patent meaning that the alleged_infringer has presented an invalidity defense that the patentee has not shown lacks substantial merit it necessarily follows that the patentee has not succeeded in showing it is likely to succeed at trial on the merits of the validity_issue'
id.at 1379
the district_court properly applied this analytical framework

a. indefiniteness
telebrands contends that the claim_term` substantially filled' is indefinite because a posa would not be able to determine whether an expandable container meets this limitation.8

`` [ a ] patent is invalid for indefiniteness if its claims read in light of the specification delineating the patent and the prosecution history fail to inform with reasonable_certainty those skilled in the art about the scope of the invention'
nautilus inc. v. biosig instruments inc. -- - u.s. -- -- 134_s.ct._2120 2124 189_l.ed.2d_37_(2014)
because telebrands did not object to the r & rs indefiniteness determination we review the district_courts determination on indefiniteness for plain_error
douglass 79 f.3d at 1430

telebrands attempts to circumvent this deferential standard of review by arguing that objecting to the r & rs claim_construction or lack thereof put the magistrate_judge on notice that it was contesting the definiteness of` substantially filled'
we disagree
nowhere in its objections to the r & r does telebrands mention the word` indefinite' j.a
1986-88 and` substantially filled' is not even among the terms flagged by telebrands-` attached' *1206` connecting force'` elastic_fastener' and the` shaking' limitation-as requiring construction
id
we fail to see how seeking the construction of different albeit related claim_terms would put the district_court on notice of telebrands objection to the r & rs conclusion that` substantially filled' was not indefinite

turning to the merits telebrands argues on appeal that the066_patent creates a subjective standard for determining whether a container is` substantially filled' because the specification makes frequent references to detaching the containers when they reach a` desired size'
appellant_br

the specification however does not define or equate` substantially filled' with` desired size'
and the claims themselves teach that shaking causes the containers to detach from the hollow_tubes when they are` substantially filled' with water066_patent col. 6_ll._46 -51 meaning that shaking will not detach the containers if they are not` substantially filled'
to put a finer point on it if the balloons detach after shaking then they are` substantially filled'
the r & r cited a portion of this claim_language to support its conclusion that the066_patent provided` specific_parameters' for determining when the containers are` substantially filled'
magistrate op. 2015_wl_11089479 at *5

telebrands alleges that the r & rs reliance on a portion of this claim_language for determining when a container is` substantially filled' was based on a truncated and incorrect reading of the claim
the r & r says` containers are substantially filled with water when thewater_overcomes the connecting force and causes the containers to detach from the hollow_tubes
`` id
( quoting066_patent col. 6_ll._48 -52
according to telebrands shaking not the water overcomes the connecting force
although shaking does contribute to the detachment as discussed above the claims specifically call for detachment by shaking when the container is` substantially filled' with water
thus we do not find this argument persuasive

in addition to the reasons set forth in the r & r the level of ordinary_skill in the art plays an important role in an indefiniteness analysis
telebrands asserts that a posa has` a general knowledge about and experience with expandable containers including without limitation balloons and at least an associates degree in science or engineering'
j.a
835-36 ? ?
10-13
we find it difficult to believe that a person with an associates degree in a science or engineering discipline who had read the specification and relevant prosecution history would be unable to determine with reasonable_certainty when a water balloon is` substantially filled'

for these reasons the district_courts conclusion that telebrands indefiniteness argument failed to raise a substantial_question of validity does not suffer from a` clear or obvious' error ortiz 806 f.3d at 825-26 requiring reversal under plain_error_review
because we find no clear or obvious_error we need not address the other plain_error factors articulated by the fifth_circuit in ortiz

b. obviousness
on appeal telebrands advances several arguments relating to the combination of the cooper saggio and lee references
because telebrands did not object to the factual_findings and legal_conclusions in the r & r relating to obviousness we review the district_courts obviousness analysis for plain_error.9

*1207 a claim is unpatentable as obvious` if the differences between the claimed invention and the prior_art are such that the claimed invention as a whole would have been obvious before the effective filing date of the claimed invention to a person having ordinary_skill in the art'
35 u.s.c.¡± 103
the law is clear however that` a patent composed of several elements is not proved obvious merely by demonstrating that each of its elements was independently known in the prior_art'
ksr int l co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 418 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007)
indeed` it can be important to identify a reason that would have prompted a person of ordinary_skill in the relevant field to combine the elements in the way the claimed new invention does'
id

telebrands argues that the district_court erred because it found there was no motivation to combine the prior_art references without first considering whether lee was reasonably pertinent to the particular_problem the inventor solved
more specifically telebrands alleges that cooper saggio and lee each relate to the same problem addressed by the066_patent` automatically sealing a balloon or multiple_balloons at one time'
appellant_br
17-18
a prior_art reference is analogous and thus can be used in an obviousness combination if it` is from the same field of endeavor regardless of the problem addressed' or` is reasonably pertinent to the particular_problem with which the inventor is involved' even if it is not within the inventors field of endeavor
unwired planet llc v. google inc. 841_f.3d_995 1000-01 fed
cir
2016 quoting in re clay 966_f.2d_656 658-59 fed
cir
1992
the particular_problem confronting the inventor here was how to rapidly fill multiple_containers with fluid
this is far removed from the problems associated with an endoscopic balloon insertion device for treating obesity and telebrands has not demonstrated that lee is reasonably pertinent to the problem addressed in the066_patent
therefore under a plain_error_review we can not say that the district_court committed a clear or obvious_error when it found insufficient motivation to combine these disparate references
absent a motivation to combine telebrands remaining obviousness_arguments are unavailing

iii
irreparable harm
finally telebrands alleges that it was clear_error for the magistrate_judge to rely on evidence pre-dating the066_patents issuance in support of its finding of irreparable_harm
citing gaf building materials corp. v. elk corp. of dallas 90_f.3d_479_(fed._cir._1996) telebrands asserts that irreparable_harm must be measured from the date the patent_issues because that is the date on which the right to exclude others arises
the gaf case is inapposite however because it addresses the dismissal for lack of jurisdiction of an action for declaratory judgment of invalidity and noninfringement of a design patent that had not yet issued
id.at 481-83
and telebrands cites no case prohibiting reliance on evidence of irreparable_harm pre-dating the patents issuance

evidence of consumer_confusion harm to reputation and loss of goodwill pre-dating the patent is at the very least circumstantial_evidence demonstrating the possibility of identical harms once the patent_issues
neither party has suggested that the issuance of a patent would somehow mitigate or otherwise eliminate those harms
similarly the pre-issuance price_erosion evidence may be relevant to show what would happen if balloon_bonanza was *1208 no longer on the market
for example it might support an argument that absent competition tinnus could raise its price back to the original price point but would not be able to do so as long as competition from balloon_bonanza remains

nonetheless the irreparable_harm analysis does not depend solely on evidence pre-dating the patent
the record contains additional evidence of harm after the066_patents issuance that is sufficient to support a finding of irreparable_harm
for example a review for tinnuss bunch_o_balloons_product on amazon-dated a few weeks after the patent issued-states that the customer liked the` off brand' bunch_o_balloons_product better than the` name brand' balloon_bonanza
j.a
1436
this establishes persisting harm to tinnuss reputation and tarnishes its status as the innovator in this market
see celsis in vitro inc. v. cellzdirect inc. 664_f.3d_922 930 fed
cir
2012` price erosion loss of goodwill damage to reputation and loss of business opportunities are all valid grounds for finding irreparable_harm`
although the post-issuance evidence is thinner we are unable to find any clear_error in the district_courts conclusion that tinnus had demonstrated irreparable_harm

conclusion
for the reasons stated above the district_court did not abuse its discretion in granting the preliminary_injunction
accordingly we affirm the district_courts judgment

affirmed

the ptab defined the following italicized claim_language as the shake-to-detach feature` each elastic_fastener configured to provide a connecting force that is not less than a weight of one of the containers when substantially filled with water.. such that shaking the hollow_tubes in a state in which the containers are substantially filled with water_overcomes the connecting force and causes the containers to detach from the hollow_tubes'

we are aware that the ptab issued a final written decision on december 30 2016 concluding that the claims of the066_patent are indefinite
the ptabs decision is not binding on this court and based on the record before us and the applicable standard of review it does not persuade us that the district_court abused its discretion in granting the preliminary_injunction
the parties are of course free to ask the district_court to reconsider its preliminary_injunction in light of the ptabs decision

telebrands also argues that` connecting force' is indefinite but its argument turns on the indefiniteness of` substantially filled'
