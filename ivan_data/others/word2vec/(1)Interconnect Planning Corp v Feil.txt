pauline newman circuit_judge
interconnect planning corporation ipc appeals from the summary_judgment of the united_states_district_court for the southern_district of new_york interconnect_planning_corp. v. feil 587_f.supp._1495 223_uspq_961_(s.d.n.y.1984) holding invalid all the claims of ipcs reissue_patent_no._31144 entitled` multi station telephone switching system' invention of thomas e. feil for failure to meet the conditions for patent validity under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 and dismissing ipcs count for patent_infringement
we hold that invalidity under ¡± 103 has not been proven as a matter of law
we vacate the summary_judgment of invalidity and dismissal of the infringement count and remand to the district_court

background
the claims of reissue_patent_no._31144 are for certain telephone_systems known as` trader_turrets' which are multi-line telephone consoles used by the financial community in trading networks for securities commodities currency and the like
the purpose of these systems is to facilitate concurrent telephone connections for traders requiring multiple sources of price information conducting multiple transactions and generally meeting the communication demands of busy often hectic financial trading enterprises
trading rooms may house a hundred or more trader_turrets

because of the large_number of lines and connections required and the specific_needs of these communication networks these systems are complex
a high degree of reliability is required in their operation because even momentary failures can be extremely costly

the record shows that the feil_trader_turrets rapidly achieved commercial_success displacing other_systems then in use
ipc attributes the success of the feil_invention to its novel system` architecture' which enabled ease of operation high capacity and improved reliability over the systems then available
ipcs sales of the feil_trader_turrets according to the record grew from $ 320 000_for_20 units in 1974 its first year to $ 27,900 000_for_3500 units in 1983

thomas_feil the inventor was formerly an officer and part owner of ipc
in 1977 mr._feil formed the defendant company v_band systems inc. and in 1980 mr._feil left ipc and joined v_band of which he is president and chief executive officer
defendants make and sell the trader_turrets that are here accused of patent_infringement

on november 21 1980 ipc filed suit in the southern_district of new_york asserting infringement of u.s._patent_no._3991,282 the282_patent invention of thomas_feil
defendants_feil and v_band raised the defense this patent was invalid in terms of 35 u.s.c.¡± 103
ipcs count for unfair competition was dismissed by the court and is not before us
various counterclaims were separated and are apparently still pending

in may of 1981 ipc filed in the u.s. patent and trademark_office the pto an application to reissue the282_patent
ipc cited to the examiner articles by m.e
ozenberger and w.h
keith both of the bell telephone laboratories on which articles defendants were relying before the district_court and which had not previously been before the examiner
the district_court refused to stay the action before it pending completion of the reissue_examination and therefore the reissue_examination was suspended by the pto in accordance with its rules
on defendants motion for summary_judgment the district_court on june_1,_1982 held all claims of the282_patent invalid for obviousness under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103
interconnect_planning_corp. v. feil 543_f.supp._610 614-19 215_uspq_734 736-41 s.d.n.y.1982

following this decision at ipcs request the pto resumed examination of the reissue_application
the courts decision was provided to and considered by the examiner
*1135 a supplemental reissue declaration by ipc referred to this decision as a basis for the reissue_application
the282_patent was surrendered and on february 8 1983 the pto granted the reissue_patent re 31,144 ipc having restricted its claims in various ways and having overcome the newly cited prior_art

defendants moved for summary_judgment of invalidity of the reissue_patent asserting collateral_estoppel based on the courts decision on the282_patent and also asserting invalidity under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103
ipc resisted the motion and the parties memoranda affidavits depositions and other documents are of record
for reasons similar to those of the 1982 decision the motion for summary_judgment was granted on june_20,_1984

that decision holding all of the reissue_claims invalid was certified and made final under fed.r.civ.p
54 b with instructions by the court that ipc` attempt to have any appeal.. heard at the same time and before the same panel' as any appeal from a decision on the same patent by the united_states_district_court for the district of new jersey.1 we agreed
both appeals are decided this day

although both appeals involved similar issues and argument specific to the new_york suit are certain procedural issues as discussed infra

collateral estoppel
defendants argue that ipcs appeal rights are curtailed on the basis of collateral_estoppel
two separate but related issues of estoppel are raised both arising out of the district_courts 1982 decision on the282_patent

a
defendants assert first that ipc can not now appeal from or argue those aspects of the 1984 decision on the reissue_patent which are` common to' the 1982 decision on the282_patent on the ground that those aspects could have been appealed earlier and that it is too late to do so now
ipc asserts in response that 1 the issues are not the same 2 a different patent is involved and 3 the 1982 decision was not final

considering the finality issue for collateral_estoppel to arise the prior decision need not have been final in the sense of 28 u.s.c.¡± 1291 but in the words of the restatement the prior adjudication must have been` sufficiently firm to be accorded conclusive effect'
restatement second of judgments ¡± 13 1982
sufficient firmness according to the restatement requires that the party against whom the estoppel is asserted have had the right even if not exercised to challenge on appeal the correctness of the earlier_decision
restatement second of judgment ¡± 13 reporters note comment f 1982
defendants argue that ipc had three such opportunities appeal under 28 u.s.c.¡± 1292 a 1 which governs appeals from interlocutory_orders involving injunctions ; appeal under 28 u.s.c.¡± 1292 c 2 which governs appeals in patent_infringement cases final except for an accounting ; and appeal under fed.r.civ.p
54 b which governs judgment on fewer than all of multiple claims in an action

none of these situations controls the case before us
28 u.s.c.¡± 1292 a 1 relates to orders involving injunctions and although defendants argue that ipcs complaint necessarily invokes this section this does not impart automatic appealability to interlocutory_orders that do not involve injunctions
as for 28 u.s.c.¡± 1292 c 2 the district_courts judgment was not final except for an accounting in light of the pendency of counterclaims

fed.r.civ.proc
54 b requires that the court have expressly directed entry of a final_judgment and that` [ i ] n the absence of such determination and direction any [ decision ] which adjudicates fewer than all the claims *1136.. shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims'

54.42 at 813

neither ipc nor the defendants asked the district_court to enter a final_judgment on its decision holding the282_patent invalid and the court did not do so
defendants assert however that ipc should now be estopped because it did not move for finality of the ruling nor request that the judgment be certified for interlocutory appeal
an application for certification is by no means certain to be granted and in this case ipcs eventual request for certification of the original decision was opposed by defendants and was refused by the court

the law of collateral_estoppel is not intended to penalize a party for declining to try to take a piecemeal appeal
further the282_patent had been placed in reissue and an appeal on the merits of patent claims for which reissue was being sought would have been a meaningless exercise as may have been recognized at the time

we conclude that the district_courts 1982 decision on the282_patent claims a decision not final not certified not appealed and mooted by subsequent events lacks collateral_estoppel effect for the purpose urged by defendants
the issue here on appeal is the validity of the claims of the reissue_patent an issue that did not exist at the time of the decision on validity of the282_patent claims
there is no estoppel against appellate review of all aspects pertinent to the decision on the reissue_claims

b. ipc asserts that the district_court incorrectly invoked collateral_estoppel when it analyzed the reissue_claims by comparing them with the original_claims of the282_patent then applying prior_art only to the differences between the reissue_claims and the original_claims
our predecessor court the u.s. court of claims,2 has confronted related situations wherein estoppel was raised as to unadjudicated claims of a patent whose other claims had been adjudicated in an earlier action
the court of claims adopted a pragmatic approach stating that the first step was to determine whether any new issues were raised as to the nonlitigated_claims
in westwood chemical inc. v. united_states 525_f.2d_1367 1375 207_ct.cl._791 187_uspq_656_(1975) adopting 186_uspq_383 389 ct.cl.tr.div.1975 the court said

where obviousness is the basis for the prior invalidity holding an inquiry into the identity of the validity issue is more properly phrased in terms of the factual inquiries mandated by graham v. john_deere_co. 383_u.s._1 17 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966) as a prerequisite to such a validity determination
applying the graham_guidelines the court said thus the inquiry should be whether the nonlitigated_claims present new issues as to the art pertinent to the nonlitigated_claims ; as to the scope and content of that art ; as to the differences between the prior_art and the nonlitigated_claims ; and as to the level of ordinary_skill in that art
if none of these inquiries raises any new triable issues then the obviousness determination in the prior proceeding should be equally applicable to the nonlitigated_claims

the question of substantial_identity of reissue_claims arose in plastic container corp. v. continental plastics of oklahoma *1137 inc. 607_f.2d_885 203_uspq_27_(10th_cir.1979) cert
denied 444_u.s._1018 100_s.ct._672 62_l.ed.2d_648 204_uspq_696_(1980) wherein the court determined that the reissue_claims were not substantially identical to the original_claims and therefore that collateral_estoppel did not apply

in bourns responding to plaintiffs argument that according collateral_estoppel effect to non-identical adjudicated claims would amount to treating the claims previously held to be invalid as prior_art the court agreed that this would be inappropriate a domino approach in which each successively narrower claim is compared with the one before it not with the prior_art is inappropriate since it improperly gives prior-art effect to the subject matter of an invalid claim

& pat.app. 411_f.2d_1333 1335 1969
537 f.2d at 493 187 uspq at 179

the district_court compared the reissue_claims with the282 claims and erroneously concluded that reissue_claims 1_through_6 were substantially identical to the original_claims and that reissue_claims 7_through_9 although not substantially identical involved some substantially identical` issues'

this erroneous legal conclusion may have compounded the error in the next step wherein the court compared the differences between the original and the reissue_claims with prior_art that was pertinent only to those differences thus effectively giving the original_claims prior_art effect-the pitfall against which bourns cautioned a claim may be invalid for obviousness under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 but still describe a combination not found in the prior_art
moreover it is well settled that each claim of a patent is entitled to a presumption of validity and is to be treated as a complete and independent invention

when a patent has been reissued with claims that are not substantially identical to the original_claims the invention as a whole as now claimed must be evaluated in terms of 35 u.s.c.¡± 103
the original_claims whether valid or invalid are not prior_art against the reissued claims

the summary judgment
the proceeding from which this appeal is taken was styled` summary' in that the courts decision was made on defendants motion for summary_judgment
the earlier_decision on the282_patent was also made on defendants motion for summary_judgment
ipc contends that the matter was inappropriate to summary_judgment in view of the presence of disputed issues of material_fact

defendants_feil and v_band argued before the district_court and repeat before us that no material_fact is in dispute that the questions before the district_court and before us in this appeal are purely legal ones and that the issue was properly dealt with summarily
in its discussion of reissue_claims 7_through_9 which claims had no counterpart in the original patent the district_court referred to` claims and issues that have not yet been subjected to a full and fair adjudication' 587 f.supp.at 1500 223 uspq at 965 ; the court viewed both proceedings as` full' as well as fair a process not always accomodated by summary proceedings on a documentary record

obviousness vel non under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 is a question of law whose conclusion requires preliminary determination of several underlying factual issues as set out in graham v. john_deere_co. 338_u.s._1 69_s.ct._1434 93_l.ed._1765 148_uspq_459_(1966)

denied 105_s.ct._116 105_s.ct._116 83_l.ed.2d_60 225_uspq_232_(1984)
these factual issues relate to the scope and *1138 content of the prior_art the differences between the prior_art and the claimed invention as a whole the level of ordinary_skill in the art at the time the invention was made and the so-called` secondary_considerations' that reflect the contemporaneous response to the invention

in reviewing ipcs assertions that there were genuine issues of material_fact relating to the graham inquiries we have reviewed the submissions of the parties
before the court according to the record were all the references cited as prior_art ; as well as the depositions of examiner randall p. myers of the united_states patent and trademark_office engineer john fitzmaurice of new_york telephone and inventor/defendant thomas e. feil ; and various documentary exhibits
also of record were the affidavits of alan r. fitzpatrick president of american telecommunications concepts ; ipcs technical experts dennis maywald and herbert goldwag ; thomas p. bradbury vice president and treasurer of ipc ; and extensive written submissions and arguments

although fact and opinion are intertwined in many of these documents the factual considerations required by the graham analysis appear to have been adequately presented in the record
the technological structure and operation of the devices of the prior_art were not in material dispute,3 although there was strong dispute about the relationship of the teachings of the references to the problems solved by the feil_system and the weight to be given to evidence of the feil_inventions commercial_success

the district_court stated that expert_testimony was unnecessary interconnect_planning_corp. v. feil 587 f.2d at 1497 223 uspq at 963 and held all of the reissue_claims invalid
as will be discussed we think that the district_court reached this conclusion by incorrectly applying the law of 35 u.s.c.¡± 103

35 u.s.c.¡± 103
those charged with determining compliance with 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 are required to place themselves in the minds of those of ordinary_skill in the relevant art at the time the invention was made to determine whether that which is now plainly at hand would have been obvious at such earlier time

the invention must be viewed not with the blueprint drawn by the inventor but in the state of the art that existed at the time

the invention must be evaluated not through the eyes of the inventor who may have been of exceptional skill but as by one of` ordinary_skill'
see stewart-warner corp. v. city of pontiac michigan 767_f.2d_1563 1570 226_uspq_676 680-81 fed.cir.1985

this is not a facile statutory interpretation
the quality of non-obviousness is not easy to measure particularly when challenged years after the invention was made
that which may be made clear and thus` obvious' to a court with the invention fully diagrammed and aided in this case by a hostile inventor seeking to eliminate his own_invention may have been a breakthrough of substantial dimension when first unveiled

the judicial application of uniform standards for determining compliance with 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 is essential because the technological incentives fostered by the patent system depend on consistent interpretation of the law
to this end faithful adherence to the patent statute and guiding precedent fosters uniformity in result

*1139 a
following examination by the patent and trademark_office a duly issued patent is presumed valid as is a duly reissued patent
the burden of proving otherwise resides with the person challenging its validity
35 u.s.c.¡± 282

this statutory_presumption derives in part from recognition of the technological expertise of the patent examiners
a reissue_application receives a fresh examination normally concentrated on those references and reasons that occasioned its filing
the record shows that this reissue_application received a supplemental internal review by three examiners because it was involved in litigation

although ipcs view is incorrect that the ptos decision must be given controlling weight we do agree that the examination procedure and result should be given appropriate consideration and due_weight by the court
as stated in fromson v. advance offset plate inc. 755_f.2d_1549 1555 225_uspq_26 31 fed.cir.1985` [ t ] he examiners decision on an original or reissue_application is never binding on the court
it is however evidence the court must consider in determining whether the party asserting invalidity has met its statutory burden by clear and convincing_evidence'

upon reissue the` burden of proving invalidity was made heavier' as stated in fromson supra
this burden must be met by the party asserting invalidity
the district_court here relied on the identical references that had been before the reissue examiners and disdaining the need for expert_testimony reached a different conclusion in law
although we affirm the obligation of the district_court to reach an independent conclusion the reissue_patent reaches the court clothed in a statutory_presumption of validity and clear and convincing_evidence is required to surmount this presumption

the court referred to the content of the prior_art_references in broad terms occasionally using the title of a reference to explain its pertinence
in this crowded art of telephone_systems as ipc correctly pointed out it is not enough to show that each of the components used by feil was known and had been used in other telephone_systems
feil did not claim to have invented any of the components of his claimed system

from its discussion of the prior_art it appears to us that the court guided by the defendants treated each reference as teaching one or more of the specific components for use in the feil_system although the feil_system did not then exist
thus the court reconstructed the feil_system using the blueprint of the feil claims
as is well established this is legal error

illustrative is the courts analysis of reissue_claim 1
pertinent is not only its analysis of the differences between the reissue_claim and the prior_art but also the differences between the reissue_claim and the original_claim
in claim 1 matter enclosed in brackets appeared in the original_claim but forms no part of the reissue_claim and matter printed in italics was added by reissue 1
for a telephone_system in which telephone_communication is capable of being established for each telephone_station of a plurality of telephone_stations over a standard_telephone_line by directly connecting each telephone_station to a selected standard_telephone_line of a plurality of standard_telephone_lines each of said plurality of standard_telephone_lines capable of being directly connected to each of said plurality of telephone_stations an improvement comprising a plurality of pairs of contacts with respective_pairs of said contacts being *1140 connected with respective_ones of said standard_telephone_lines for allowing said communication ; a plurality of relay_coils with respective_ones of said relay_coils controlling respective_pairs of said contacts to be opened or closed ; a plurality of sets of non-locking pushbutton [ switch_means ] switches with each set of pushbutton [ switch_means ] switches connected to respective_ones of said telephone_stations with respective_ones of said pushbutton [ switch_means ] switches of said sets of pushbutton [ switch_means ] switches corresponding to respective_ones of said standard_telephone_lines and being connected with respective_ones of said relay_coils and being depressed for energizing a selected one of said relay_coils for closing a corresponding_pair of contacts to allow said telephone_communication ; [ and ] an electronic holding circuit for each of said relay_coils said holding circuits being operative
to establish a held state after initial energization of the associated relay_coil by momentarily depressing the associated pushbutton switch and
to maintain said corresponding_pair of contacts closed while in the held state ; a logic_circuit for each station connected to said holding circuits to detect conditions for releasing the held state ; each of said stations comprising [ first_light_display means ] a set of status_lights connection means connecting corresponding pushbuttons of said sets of pushbutton [ switch_means ] switches in each of said stations and to said [ first_light_display means ] status_lights for energizing said [ first_light_display means ] status_lights in each station to display the status of each of said plurality of standard_telephone_lines in each of said stations said station further comprising [ first_light_display means ] an active line indicator separate from said status_lights connected to said pushbutton [ switch_means ] switches for identifying the standard_telephone_line of said plurality of standard_telephone_lines that the telephone_station is using for said telephone_communication

reissue claim 1 was held invalid on two grounds
the first ground was that it was substantially identical to claim 1 of the282_patent and thus invalid on the basis of collateral_estoppel
the court in its 1982 decision referred to carter u.s._patent_no._3150,238 and foulkes u.s._patent_no._3757,056 as disclosing` non-locking buttons relay_coils and pairs of contacts' as applied to the original_claim 1
in the 1984 decision the court stated that` claim 1 has not been changed in such a way that alters the above finding of disclosure by prior_art'
587 f.supp.at 1499 223 uspq at 964
this treatment of the reissue_claim is not supported by the claim content as will be apparent from the courts further discussion of claim 1

as the second ground for its holding of invalidity the court analyzed the changes made by reissue
the court identified three areas as new to reissue_claim 1 and applied five references to these areas as follows` see defendants exhs
c13 d4-d6 non-locking buttons ; defendants exhs
c4 c7 holding circuits ; defendants exhs
c16 c13 separate_active_lines'
id.at 1499 223 uspq at 964 footnotes omitted

the first set of cited exhibits refers to articles by keith` a new switching system forright of way companies' bell_laboratories_record apr
1968 and ozenberger` voice communication system for air traffic control' bell_laboratories_record may 1961 which the court stated taught the use of non-locking pushbuttons
the second set refers to the carter_patent which the district_court said teaches a` relay control circuit' the title of the carter_patent and the foulkes_patent which` recites that [ e ] ach of these [ control ] circuits may take any desired and presently known form.. to perform a recognized control *1141 function.. evaluat [ ing ] thehold feature`
id.at 1499_n._6 223 uspq at 946_n._6
the third set of exhibits refers to simon u.s._patent_no._3928,732 which the district_court described by its title` extension and line indicating display system for key telephone system' and keith which the district_court stated` also discloses separate_active_lines'
id.at 1499_n._7 223 uspq at 964_n._7

the courts analysis of the scope of the new material in reissue_claim 1 in itself shows the error in the courts conclusion that as a matter of law reissue_claim 1 is substantially identical to its parent_claim
the claim limitations of the electronic holding circuits for each relay_coil the logic_circuit and separate active line indicator in combination with the non-locking pushbutton switches connected to the relay_coils were added by reissue
observing these differences their relationship to the invention as a whole and the prior_art we conclude as a matter of law that reissue_claim 1 is not substantially identical to the original_claim
the 1982 decision which was directed to the original_claims does not apply to the reissue_claims
collateral estoppel as a basis for the courts holding of invalidity is not supported in law

having determined that a reissue_claim is not substantially identical to the parent the parent_claim is of no further moment
as stated in wayne-gossard corp. v. moretz hosiery mills inc. 539_f.2d_986 991 191_uspq_543 546-47 4th cir.1976` the original_claim was at an end denuded of all potency save as a bench mark of interpretation at the time of the reissues infringement'

the original_claim is not prior_art against the reissue_claim
it is not correct to weigh the reissue_claim against the original_claim
it is not correct to weigh the changes in the reissue_claim against the original_claim
it is the reissue_claim alone that is to be analyzed in accordance with the graham_guidelines and the differences to be considered are the differences between the reissue_claim as a whole and the prior_art

in the courts 1982 analysis of the original_claims to which the court referred in its 1984 decision the court had identified` six principal features which plaintiff argues are not obvious' and explained why the court concluded that these features are obvious by referring to various prior_art_references showing various of the features in various contexts
interconnect_planning_corp. v. feil 543 f.supp.at 617 215 uspq at 739
as we have observed it is the emphasis on the obviousness of` features' rather than the claimed telephone_system as a whole that constitutes the flaw in the application of section 103 to the feil claims
as stated in in re shuman 361_f.2d_1008 1012 150_uspq_54 57 ccpa 1966 it is impermissible to first ascertain factually what appellants did and then view the prior_art in such a manner as to select from the random facts of that art only those which may be modified and then utilized to reconstruct appellants invention from such prior_art

the court in 1982 summarized its conclusion with respect to these six` features' by observing 1 that although the pairs of contacts and relay_coils` is not disclosed in either the keith article or the ozenberger article' the foulkes and carter_patents do disclose them ; 2 that keith ozenberger and foulkes refer to pushbutton switches ; 3 that keith shows a set of display lamps although ozenberger uses a single lamp and that paraskevakos u.s._patent_no._3727,003 and simon et al
show either a digital display or the incoming line number ; 4 that paraskevakos shows a decoder and that` the diode matrix was no mystery to one engineer' thomas fitzmaurice of bell_labs who testified that he readily understood the feil_system after he was shown it ; 5 that keith shows which lines are active ; and 6 that the asserted unique master station hook up with blocking means is shown in ozenberger and a verdon patent u.s._patent_no._3819,871

*1142 in its 1984 decision the court added the additional citations of references pertinent to the changes in the reissue_claims as discussed above
as in its citation of references against the various features of the original_claims the court selected from each reference a feature or features that also appeared in the reissue_claims
no reference however suggested the overall arrangement the` architecture' of the feil_system

ipc presented affidavit testimony explaining the references in the context of the state of the telephone_systems art at the time none of which testimony was controverted other than by attorney_argument
the most advanced multi-line devices at the time the invention was made according to this record used the then state-of-the-art crossbar switching equipment and electrical or mechanical interconnections or interlocks
the two bell_labs publications of keith and ozenberger on which defendants and the district_court placed substantial emphasis used crossbar switching
feil did not

mr._feils affidavit filed with the district_court states` the ozenberger and keith articles disclose what i thought i invented in 1974'
mr._feil made no reference to the crossbar_switches required by these references and offered no discussion of either differences or similarities between his system and those of these references

the carter_patent used relay switches in the telephone switching system it describes
carter of bell laboratories taught the use of quick-release control relays in combination with slow-release work relays to achieve the specific purposes desired by carter
carter also required use of a` locking chain' rather than independently operating relays and a more complex communication path as compared with feils direct connections
feil established multiple direct connections in a system where theretofore it was believed according to the record that crossbar_switches would be required

the feil_system eliminated both crossbar_switches and mechanical interlocks or mechanically locking pushbuttons and instead used relays a well-known type of switch
but feil avoided the need of carter to establish potentially large_numbers of contacts and operate a concomitantly large_number of relays in series in order to connect stations within the system
as ipcs uncontroverted testimony shows feil avoided interconnections and interlocks both of which according to the maywald_affidavit had previously been considered necessary to lock out faults
the maywald_affidavit stated that carters approach would be` impossible and impractical' in the trader turret application because` [ t ] o try and accurately control the release times of different relays over a long period of time would be virtually impossible considering the wear and deterioration of components' in a` trader turret network involving some 20,000 or more relays'
maywalds explanation of the technical operation of the references is uncontradicted although defendants take issue in attorney_argument with maywalds conclusions

the foulkes_patent on which the district_court also relies described a` bipolar multiplexing circuit' based on a` contact tree' relay switching arrangement
foulkes taught a telephone_system that maywald avers without contradiction` could not be realistically expanded into large systems like trader_turrets'
the district_court did not explain how the foulkes or other_systems of different circuitry made obvious the different system of feils claims

the keith and ozenberger systems as previously discussed are different systems from that of feil
like the systems of the other references they contain some elements in common with that of feil
the ozenberger system based on crossbar_switches was designed for air traffic control
the keith system is described as tailored to the specific_needs of` right-of-way' companies and is a cordless system limited to up to eight consoles of up to a hundred lines
as keith says` [ a ] system of crossbar_switches is the heart of the switching system'
neither keith nor ozenberger suggests that the crossbars be *1143 replaced with relays and that the other changes be made to produce the admittedly different feil_system

the novelty of the feil_system is not controverted by the defendants
its value in trader turret systems has received the ultimate recognition market_success and imitation

35 u.s.c.¡± 103 requires that obviousness be determined with respect to the invention as a whole
see e.g. jones v. hardy 727_f.2d_1524 1528 220_uspq_1021 1024 fed.cir.1984 ; w.l

this is essential for combination inventions for generally all combinations are of known elements

when prior_art_references require selective combination by the court to render obvious a subsequent invention there must be some reason for the combination other than the hindsight gleaned from the invention itself
acs hospital systems inc. v. montefiore hospital 732_f.2d_1572 1577 & n. 14 221_uspq_929 933 & n. 14 fed.cir.1984
there must be` something in the prior_art as a whole to suggest the desirability and thus the obviousness of making the combination'
lindemann maschinenfabrik gmbh v. american_hoist and derrick_co. 730_f.2d_1452 1462 221_uspq_481 488 fed.cir.1984

critical to the analysis is an understanding of the particular results achieved by the new combination
the claims here at issue are directed to a combination of known components of telephone_systems in an admittedly new way to achieve a new total system
neither the district_court in its opinion nor the defendants identified any suggestion in the prior_art that the components be combined as they were by feil or that such combination could achieve the advantages of the feil_system

not only must the claimed invention as a whole be evaluated but so also must the references as a whole so that their teachings are applied in the context of their significance to a technician at the time-a technician without our knowledge of the solution
the defendants propounded and the district_court appears to have followed an analytical method that well illustrates the` mosaic' analogy discussed in w.l
gore & assocs. 721 f.2d at 1552 220 uspq at 312 where this court said [ t ] he claims were used as a frame and individual naked parts of separate prior_art_references were employed as a mosaic to recreate a facsimile of the claimed invention

defendants refer to the decision of the supreme court in sakraida v. ag pro inc. 425_u.s._273 96_s.ct._1532 47_l.ed.2d_784 189_uspq_449_(1976)
as the court there held sakraidas combination of old elements to wash barn floors with flowing water did not produce a new or different function and affirmed the district_courts holding that`all of the elements of [ the combination ] are old.. and the combination of them.. being neither new nor meeting the test of non-obviousness
`` id.at 274 96_s.ct._1533 -34 189 uspq at 450
in the feil_invention the combination was admittedly new and it produced a new system having theretofore unavailable attributes

recognizing the difficulty of casting ones mind back to the state of technology at the time the invention was made courts have long recognized the usefulness of evidence of the contemporaneous attitude toward the asserted invention
a retrospective view of the invention is best gleaned from those who were there at the time
mr._feil the inventor impugning his own_invention now avers that he did no more than did the prior_art specifically the keith and ozenberger articles
mr._feils disavowal of his invention is staunch although he less modestly commented in 1977 before *1144 he left ipc on the reaction of bell_labs engineer at that earlier time he [ fitzmaurice ] showed too much enthusiasm
i mean he was really excited by the thing

although the district_court remarked in its 1982 decision that evidence of commercial_success` can not be afforded any weight'` in light of my finding of obviousness' 543 f.2d at 619 215 uspq at 741 such evidence when present must be considered and afforded appropriate weight

ipc offered affidavit and deposition evidence by two experts in telephone_systems and by a bell system engineer knowledgeable in the field of trader_turrets
their uncontroverted testimony was to the effect that the feil_system was perceived at the time as an exceptional technological achievement

the requirement that` secondary_considerations' be considered in determinations under section 103 aids in evaluating the state of the art at the time the invention was made
in re piasecki 745_f.2d_1468 1475 223_uspq_785 790 fed.cir.1984
it is not pertinent that the invention was easily understood after it was made-a factor that appears to have been considered significant by the district_court see 543 f.supp.at 619 215 uspq at 741-but whether it would have been obvious to make the invention at the time
giving due_weight to the market_success and contemporaneous reaction to the feil trader turret system the record does not contain clear and convincing_evidence that the feil_invention of the reissue_claims would have been obvious to one of ordinary_skill in this art at the time the invention was made

reissue claims 2-9 are either dependent on reissue_claim 1 include similar limitations or include additional limitations
although each claim has been considered separately they need not here be treated in redundant detail
for each claim we are compelled to the conclusion that the burden of proving invalidity by clear and convincing_evidence has not been met

the summary_judgment of invalidity of reissue_patent_no._31144 in terms of 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 is vacated as is the dismissal of the infringement claim
the case is remanded to the district_court for further proceedings consistent herewith
