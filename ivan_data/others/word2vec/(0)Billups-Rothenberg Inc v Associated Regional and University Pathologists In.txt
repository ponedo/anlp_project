gajarsa circuit_judge
this is an appeal from a patent infringement action involving a genetic_test for type i hereditary_hemochromatosis
billups-rothenberg inc.` billups' sued associated_regional and university pathologists inc.` arup' and bio-rad_laboratories inc.` bio-rad' alleging infringement of u.s. patent nos._5674,681` ¡¬681_patent` and 6,355,425` ¡¬425_patent` collectively` patents-in-suit'
the parties filed cross-motions for summary_judgment
the district_court denied billupss motion for summary_judgment of infringement and granted arup and bio-rads motion for invalidity
in its order the district_court concluded that 1 the asserted_claims of the ¡¬681_patent were invalid for lack of written description and 2 the asserted_claims of the ¡¬425_patent were invalid as anticipated because u.s. patent no._6025,130` ¡¬130_patent` disclosed the claimed genetic_test for a specific mutation implicated in type i hereditary_hemochromatosis

background
deoxyribonucleic acid` dna' is the chemical name for the genetic material that forms the basis of heredity in humans
dna is composed of sequences of four nucleotides adenine thymine guanine and cytosine abbreviated a t g and c respectively arranged in functional units known as genes
each gene codes for a sequence of amino acids that make up peptides and proteins
the relationship between a nucleotide sequence and the corresponding amino acid sequence is known as the genetic_code
mutations that alter a sequence of nucleotides may change the corresponding amino acid sequence which in turn may affect the structure or function of the protein encoded by the gene

dna is packaged into structures known as chromosomes
in somatic cells humans have one pair of sex chromosomes and twenty-two pairs of autosomal chromosomes which are numbered according to size from the largest to the smallest
one chromosome per pair is inherited from each parent
each chromosome is composed of two arms known as the short_arm and long arm

the patents-in-suit describe genetic_tests for type i hereditary_hemochromatosis an iron_disorder characterized by excessive *1033 iron_absorption by the body
hereditary_hemochromatosis is caused by specific_mutations in a gene involved in regulating iron_absorption
the gene in question the high fe` hfe` gene` fe' is the chemical symbol for iron is located on the short_arm of chromosome six in humans
the hfe_gene codes for the hfe protein also known as the human hemochromatosis protein
when certain mutations occur in the hfe_gene the resulting mutated hfe protein results in increased iron_absorption from the gut
hereditary_hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive condition meaning that a person must inherit one mutated form of the hfe_gene from each parent to develop the disease
not everyone with two mutated hfe_genes becomes clinically ill and in some cases inheriting only one mutated gene in combination with mutations in other genes may lead to some increased iron_absorption
the claims of the patents-in-suit are directed to the detection of one or both of two distinct mutations in the hfe_gene known as c282y and s65c
the prior_art ¡¬130_patent describes three mutations in the hfe_gene c282y s65c and h63d

in 1994 billups filed the application for the ¡¬681_patent entitled` methods to identify hemochromatosis'
dr. barry e. rothenberg the founder of billups was named as the inventor
the ¡¬681_patent explains that type i hereditary_hemochromatosis` hemochromatosis' is a disease caused by a gene linked to the major histocompatibility complex` mhc'
¡¬681_patent col.17 ll.51-54
the genes associated with the mhc code for a variety of products many of which defend the body against pathogens
the ¡¬681_patent identifies human chromosome six as the location of the gene responsible for hemochromatosis
id
col.17 ll.53-54
the specification of the ¡¬681_patent addresses how to detect a mutation a mutation in a nucleic acid sequence can be detected by various methods to analyze nucleic acids such as by nucleic acid sequencing polymerase chain reaction or hybridization
such methods are well known to those in the art see for example sambrook et al supra 1989 ; hames and higgins nucleic acid hybridisation a practical approach irl press new york 1985 both of which are incorporated herein by reference
id
col.23 ll.26-33

although some of the ¡¬681_patents claims also cover testing for hemochromatosis by detecting defective proteins in a patients blood only claims covering the genetic_test for what is now known as the c282y_mutation are asserted in this case
claim 2 which is representative of the asserted_claims reads 2
a method to identify an individual having or predisposed to having hemochromatosis comprising the steps of a providing from the individual a sample containing a gene encoding a nonclassical_mhc_class i heavy_chain
and
b detecting a mutation in said gene which mutation results in the reduced ability of said heavy_chain to associate with said £]2_microglobulin wherein the presence of said mutation identifies said individual as having or predisposed to having hemochromatosis
id
col.31 ll.19-24

although billups claimed methods of detecting mutations responsible for hemochromatosis in the ¡¬681_patent it had not yet identified any disease-causing mutations
in august of 1995 dr._rothenberg employed dr. ritsuko sawada-hirai to help him identify the mutations responsible for hemochromatosis
they were unable *1034 to isolate the hemochromatosis_gene or any mutations of the gene

others however had more success
in 1996 dr. john n. feder and a group of scientists unaffiliated with billups isolated and sequenced the hemochromatosis_gene and published their results
john n. feder et
al. a novel mhc class i-like gene is mutated in patients with hereditary haemochromatosis 13 4 nature genetics 399 1996
this group of researchers specifically noted that` further refinement of the location of this gene has been difficult'
id.at 399
this research resulted in numerous u.s. and foreign patents including the ¡¬130_patent entitled` hereditary hemochromatosis gene'
the ¡¬130_patent discloses the exact genetic_sequences for the three mutations at issue in this case c282y h63d and s65c
see e.g. fig.4a genetic_code for the h63d and s65c_mutations identified as 24dbig_token__2_and_24__big_token d7 respectively ; fig.4c genetic_code for the c282y_mutation identified as 24d1

?
also the ¡¬130_patent describes genetic_tests for hemochromatosis utilizing the mutations and sequence_variants identified within the patent
id
col.23 ll.10-67
bio-rad is the assignee of the ¡¬130_patent and licenses it to arup a laboratory at the university of utah that provides genetic_testing services

dr._feder and his team published their discovery while arup was continuing to search for the hemochromatosis_gene and its mutations
in october 1998 a medical director at arup published a paper describing how the genetic probes for the h63d mutation also accidentally identified the nucleotide sequence a193t which corresponds to the s65c_mutation
arup developed this assay into the genetic_test presently accused of infringing the patents-in-suit
the assay detected the c282y h63d and s65c_mutations in samples from patients

at the same time the billups researchers also used the genetic_sequences discovered by dr._feder and his team to refine their own experiments
on march_26,_1999 dr._rothenberg dr. sawada-hirai and collaborator dr. james barton filed the application that matured into the ¡¬425_patent
the ¡¬425_patent claims a method for diagnosing an iron_disorder by testing for genetic mutations including s65c

claim 1 of the ¡¬425_patent appears below *1035 1
a method of diagnosing an iron_disorder or a genetic_susceptibility to developing said disorder in a mammal comprising determining the presence of a mutation in exon 2 of an hfe nucleic acid in a biological sample from said mammal wherein said mutation is not a c¡÷g substitution at nucleotide 187 of seq id no 1 and wherein the presence of said mutation is indicative of said disorder or a genetic_susceptibility to developing said disorder
¡¬425_patent col.59 ll.19-26

table 1 of the ¡¬425_patent labels a genetic_sequence identical to the genetic_sequence in figure 4a of the ¡¬130_patent as` s65c'
cf
¡¬425_patent col.1-big_token__2_table_1_` gagagtcgcc' __big_token ; ¡¬130_patent fig.4a` gagagtcgcc'
additionally the ¡¬425_patent explains that two of the twenty hemochromatosis patients had the s65c_mutation
¡¬425_patent col.31 ll.20-big_token__37_table_6__big_token col.32 l.8` probands 3_and_4 had a s65c_mutation'
the inventors of the ¡¬425_patent concluded that the s65c_mutation could be used to diagnose hemochromatosis
id
col.32 ll.8-13

in 2009 billups sued arup and bio-rad for infringement of the patents-in-suit
billups amended its complaint and alleged that arup and bio-rad infringe the patents-in-suit by` providing and/or using diagnostic assays or kits for detecting hemochromatosis' associated with one or both of the c282y and s65c_mutations

after completion of discovery a markman hearing and claim construction by the court the parties filed cross-motions for summary_judgment
the district_court granted summary_judgment of invalidity for lack of a written description to arup and bio-rad
the district_court found it undisputed that` the dna sequence of the hemochromatosis_gene and/or sequence of the c282y_mutation were not expressly specified in the ¡¬ 681 patent'
summ
j
order 3
further the district_court noted that it is` undisputed by the parties that no species of the genus of dna mutations the presence of which would identify an individual as having or being predisposed to having hemochromatosis were disclosed in the ¡¬681_patent specification'
id.at 6
the district_court further stated that` [ d ] escribing the structure of the resulting protein is not the same as describing the structure of the dna and its mutations
the invention claimed in the ¡¬681_patent is a method to test for a dna mutation not a test for a defective protein'
id
additionally the district_court explained that the` patentee has merely directed the person of ordinary_skill in the art to a general_location of a mutation on a chromosome and suggested that the mutation may be found in that vicinity'
id.at 8
the district_court held the asserted_claims of the ¡¬681_patent invalid for lack of written description
the district_court concluded that arup and bio-rads enablement arguments were` persuasive' but declined to rule on them in light of its ruling that the claims failed the written description_requirement
id.at 9

the district_court also granted summary_judgment of invalidity of the ¡¬ 425 patent
first it held that bio-rads ¡¬130_patent was prior_art under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 e because it was filed on may_23,_1996 which is before the march 1999 filing date of the ¡¬425_patent
id.at 3-4 10
then the district_court determined that the asserted_claims of the ¡¬425_patent are anticipated because they claim` the same genetic_test for s65c as is disclosed in the ¡¬130_patent'
id.at 10
the district_court entered final judgment in favor of arup and bio-rad dismissing the case
this court has jurisdiction over billupss timely filed appeal pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

*1036 discussion
this court reviews an order of summary_judgment de novo
see e.g. amgen inc. v. hoechst marion roussel inc. 314_f.3d_1313 1339 fed.cir.2003
summary judgment must be granted when drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-movant there is no genuine_issue as to any material_fact

we first examine whether the asserted_claims of the ¡¬681_patent are invalid for lack of written description
then we determine whether the asserted_claims of the ¡¬425_patent are invalid as anticipated

i
written description is a statutory requirement set forth in 35 u.s.c.¡± 112
the written description_requirement requires the inventor to disclose the claimed invention so as to` allow persons of ordinary_skill in the art to recognize that [ the inventor ] invented what is claimed'

`` requiring a written description of the invention limits patent protection to those who actually perform the difficult work ofinvention'-that is conceive of and complete the final invention'
id
the written description_requirement exists to ensure that inventors do not` attempt to preempt the future before it has arrived'
fiers v. revel 984_f.2d_1164 1171 fed.cir.1993
in fiers a partys priority application failed to provide an adequate written description as it purported to cover all dnas coding for a specific protein but did not describe the dna
the party only provided a generic reference that the dna could be obtained by reverse transcription and this court held that` [ c ] laiming all dnas that achieve a result without defining what means will do so is not in compliance with the description_requirement'
id

the` level of detail required to satisfy the written description_requirement varies depending on the nature and scope of the claims and on the complexity and predictability of the relevant technology'
ariad 598 f.3d at 1351 citing capon v. eshhar 418_f.3d_1349 1357-58 fed.cir.2005
`` [ a ] n adequate description of a dna requires more than a mere statement that it is part of the invention and reference to a potential method for isolating it ; what is required is a description of the dna itself'

complementary dna` cdna' is a form of dna that only contains exons stretches of dna that code for genes
in regents a claim to a cdna invention was held invalid as lacking written description because such a claim` requires a specificity usually achieved by means of the recitation of the sequence of nucleotides that make up the cdna'
id.at 1569

billups claims that its disclosure of the mutations general_location somewhere` within less than a 300 base_pair_region of a defined exon of a well studied multi-gene family' combined with the knowledge that existed at the time of filing the ¡¬681_patent established that dr._rothenberg possessed the claimed invention
appellants br
9
the ¡¬681_patent claims a test for mutations yet it is undisputed that the specification and originally filed claims of the ¡¬681_patent disclose neither the hemochromatosis_gene sequence nor any specific_mutations within that gene
although the ¡¬681_patent states that the hemochromatosis_mutations are in a gene encoding the a3 domain of a nonclassical_mhc_class i heavy_chain located on the short_arm of chromosome six that does not disclose the exact location or sequence of the mutation
*1037 ¡¬681_patent col.32 ll.13-14
billups did not possess a genetic mutation useful for diagnosing hemochromatosis when it filed its patent application in december of 1994
the ¡¬681_patent merely represents billupss research plan
see ariad 598 f.3d at 1351

billups maintains that based on knowledge outside the patent including the subsequent discovery of c282y the ¡¬681_patent adequately described the envisioned but then unknown mutations
given the lack of knowledge of sequences for the hemochromatosis_gene and its mutations in the field the limited extent and content of the prior_art and the immaturity and unpredictability of the science when the ¡¬681_patent was filed billups can not satisfy the written description_requirement merely through references to later-acquired knowledge
this case is like regents and fiers in which the dna sequences at issue were unknown in the art
regents 119 f.3d at 1567-69 ; fiers 984 f.2d at 1171

the ¡¬681_patent claims methods covering the identification of a genus of unknown genetic mutations
¡¬681_patent col.31 ll.19-24
a claim encompassing two or more disclosed embodiments within its scope is a genus claim
for genus claims` an adequate written description of a claimed genus requires more than a generic statement of an inventions boundaries'
ariad 598 f.3d at 1349 citing regents 119 f.3d at 1568
under ariad a patent must set forth` either a representative number of species falling within the scope of the genus or structural_features common to the members of the genus'
id.at 1350
the ¡¬681_patent does not identify even a single species that satisfies the claims
in this case the eventual discovery of only one species-the c282y_mutation-within the claimed genus does not constitute adequate written description of that genus

ariad also explained that` [ f ] unctional claim language can meet the written description_requirement when the art has established a correlation between structure and function'
id
billups maintains that the ¡¬681_patent satisfies the written description_requirement because it contains functional claim language
billups contends that the ¡¬681_patent taught structure i.e. that hemochromatosis has a genetic basis and function namely its adverse effect upon the binding of £]2_microglobulin with a nonclassical_mhc_class i heavy_chain
specifically billups argues that the ¡¬681_patents correlation of function with the general_location of the c282y_mutation combined with the knowledge of a person of ordinary_skill in the art in the field at the time of filing satisfied the written description_requirement by localizing the mutation to a 300 base_pair_region

the district_court however found that the art did not establish a correlation between structure and function because the` [ p ] atentees general_location disclosure is too imprecise to constitute structural_features necessary to meet the written description_requirement'
summ
j
order 6-9
as explained in the district_courts order the` specification for the ¡¬ 681 patent contains only functional not structural characteristics of the predicted mutations'
id.at 7
the district_court properly granted summary_judgment to appellees that there is no genuine_issue of material_fact that the asserted_claims of the ¡¬681_patent are invalid for lack of written description_requirement

finally billups argues that the district_court erred in failing to rule upon whether the ¡¬681_patent satisfied the enablement_requirement of 35 u.s.c.¡± 112
because the district_court properly granted summary *1038 judgment that the ¡¬681_patent does not satisfy the written description_requirement it was not erroneous for it to decline to rule upon whether the ¡¬681_patent satisfied the enablement_requirement of 35 u.s.c.¡± 112

ii
a patent claim is anticipated if each and every limitation is found either expressly or inherently in a single prior_art reference
35 u.s.c.¡± 102
the asserted_claims of the ¡¬425_patent are invalid because they are anticipated by the ¡¬130_patent
the ¡¬130_patent was filed nearly three years before the ¡¬425_patent and is prior_art under ¡± 102 e
the district_court correctly ruled that the ¡¬130_patent discloses use of the s65c_mutation as a` hh [ hereditary_hemochromatosis ] diagnostic' and thus billups was not the first to disclose diagnosis of hemochromatosis using the s65c_mutation
summ
j
order 11

the ¡¬130_patent discloses the genetic_sequence of the s65c_mutation and describes a genetic_assay for detecting one or more of the c282y h63d and s65c_mutations
in an example entitled` hh diagnostic other nucleotide based assays' the specification of the ¡¬130_patent states that
any combination of such techniques [ for conducting a genetic_assay ] can be used in accordance with the invention for the design of a diagnostic device and method for the screening of samples of dna or rna for hh gene mutations in accordance with the invention such as the mutations and sequence_variants identified herein 24d1 24d2 and 24d7
¡¬130_patent col.38 l.64-col.39 l.8
the variants correspond to the c282y h63d and s65c_mutations respectively

billups contests whether the ¡¬130_patent discloses the subject of the ¡¬ 425 patent namely the diagnosis of an iron_disorder using the s65c_mutation
it is undisputed that the s65c_mutation falls within claim 1 of the ¡¬425_patent
billups argues that the ¡¬425_patent claims a genetic predisposition to an iron_disorder or the diagnosis of such a predisposition but the ¡¬130_patent merely correlates the s65c_mutation and hemochromatosis
billups interprets the ¡¬130_patent as concluding that the s65c_mutation was only a clinically insignificant polymorphism unrelated to disease state
thus billups contends that the ¡¬130_patent did not teach using the s65c_mutation to diagnose hemochromatosis

billupss argument is based on the portion of the ¡¬130_patent stating in table 4 the 24d7 t allele was observed in only one chromosome present in the patient sample hc43 0.4 % and present in four chromosomes from the unaffected individuals 3 %
the presence of the 24d7 t allele shows no increase in risk of acquiring hh and thus may only be a polymorphic_variant within the population
id
col.19 ll.22-27

despite the inventors uncertainty regarding the utility of the s65c_mutation because of their small sample size the ¡¬130_patent describes two genetic_tests for hemochromatosis that involve detection of the s65c_mutation as an input for the diagnosis of hemochromatosis
the patent describes one genetic_test as` hh diagnostic' meaning that it could be used in the diagnosis of hemochromatosis
id
col.38 l.65-col.39 l.40
the patent also describes a test kit for hemochromatosis_mutations including s65c
id
col.38 ll.49-52

although the ¡¬130_patent discounts the utility of the s65c_mutation in diagnosing hemochromatosis we have held that a` reference is no less anticipatory if after disclosing the invention the reference then *1039 disparages it'
celeritas techs. ltd. v. rockwell int l corp. 150_f.3d_1354 1361 fed.cir.1998
indeed in celeritas this court explained that` whether a referenceteaches away from the invention is inapplicable to an anticipation analysis'
id
( quoting kalman v. kimberly-clark corp. 713_f.2d_760 772 fed.cir.1983
in celeritas this court considered prior_art stating that` de-emphasis would cause severe inter-symbol interference in a single-carrier data signal ; it may be feasible only for multicarrier signals'
id
( emphasis added
this court held that the disclosure was sufficient to anticipate and invalidate the claims of the asserted patent as` [ t ] he fact that a modem with a single carrier data signal is shown to be less than optimal does not vitiate the fact that it is disclosed
the modem in the article is not disclosed to be inoperative'
id

like the prior_art reference in celeritas the ¡¬130_patent discloses using the s65c_mutation when diagnosing hemochromatosis but qualifies that disclosure with the observation that the mutation` may only be a polymorphic_variant'
¡¬130_patent col.19 ll.25-27 emphasis added
in both cases the prior_art questioned the utility of an application of the disclosed invention but nevertheless disclosed the invention
likewise the kalman case states that` it is only necessary that the claims under attack as construed by the court read on something disclosed in the reference'
713 f.2d at 772 overruled in part on other grounds sri int l v. matsushita elec corp. of am. 775_f.2d_1107 1125 fed.cir.1985 en banc internal_quotations omitted
in the present case the district_court correctly recognized that the ¡¬130_patent discloses a diagnostic test for hemochromatosis that included identification of the s65c_mutation and therefore anticipated the ¡¬ 425 patents claims

at oral argument billups conceded that it waived its argument that the ¡¬130_patent can not be used to anticipate because the relevant teachings were not enabled
oral arg.at 25:23-25:50 ; 29:23-29:56 available at http // www.cafc.uscourts.gov/oral-argument-recordings/all/billups.html
even if this argument had not been waived the district_court presumes the enablement of the material in a prior_art patent and billups failed to present evidence of nonenablement that the district_court found persuasive
the ¡¬130_patent may be used to anticipate the ¡¬425_patent
even though the inventors of the ¡¬ 425 patent performed experiments revealing greater diagnostic utility of the s65c_mutation than initially suspected the use of the s65c_mutation as a diagnostic tool was already contemplated by the ¡¬130_patent
accordingly there is no genuine_issue of material_fact that the asserted_claims of the ¡¬ 425 patent are invalid because they are anticipated by the ¡¬130_patent

conclusion
because the district_court properly granted summary_judgment to appellees that the asserted_claims of the ¡¬681_patent are invalid for lack of written description and the asserted_claims of the ¡¬425_patent are invalid as anticipated we affirm the judgment of the district_court
