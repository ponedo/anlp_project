opinion
hughes circuit_judge
this case returns to us on remand from the supreme_court
in shire_development llc v. watson_pharmaceuticals inc. 746_f.3d_1326 fed.cir.2014 we decided an appeal by defendant-appellants collectively watson from a decision of the united_states_district_court for the southern_district of florida
the district_court found among other things that watson infringed plaintiffs-appellees collectively shires patent under the district_courts constructions of the asserted claims
we reversed the district_courts constructions of two claim_terms and remanded for further_proceedings

following our decision in this case the supreme_court issued teva pharmaceuticals usa inc. v. sandoz inc. -- - u.s. -- -- 135_s.ct._831 -- -l.ed.2d -- -- 2015 which clarified how this court should review a district_courts construction of a claim_term
the court also vacated and remanded our shire decision for further consideration in light of this new standard of review
shire_dev. llc v. watson pharm. inc. -- - u.s. -- -- 135_s.ct._1174 191_l.ed.2d_130_(2015)
because this case does not involve factual_findings to which we owe deference under teva we again reverse the district_courts constructions of the disputed claim_terms and subsequent findings of infringement and remand for further_proceedings

i. shire owns u.s._patent_no._6773,720 which claims a controlled-release oral pharmaceutical composition for treating inflammatory_bowel_diseases
shire markets these oral pharmaceutical compositions under the brand name lialdathe_r
after watson submitted an abbreviated new drug application anda seeking approval to sell the bioequivalent of lialdathe_r shire sued for infringement of the ¡¬720_patent
after construing certain_relevant_claim_language the district_court found that watsons product infringed the ¡¬720_patent

the ¡¬720_patent -entitled` mesalazine controlled release oral pharmaceutical composition' -concerns controlled-release_oral_pharmaceutical_compositions for treating inflammatory_bowel_diseases such as crohns disease and ulcerative colitis
¡¬720_patent_col. 1_ll._9 -13
the active_ingredient in these compositions is 5-amino-salicylic acid which is also known as mesalazine or mesalamine hereinafter mesalamine
mesalamine treats inflamed areas in the bowel by direct contact with the intestinal mucosal tissue
j.a
9054
thus mesala-mine must pass through the stomach and small intestine without being absorbed into the bloodstream
j.a
9054
and it must be administered throughout the entire length of the colon so that the mesalamine contacts all affected tissues
j.a
9054
given these requirements the oral composition must contain a high percentage by weight of mesalamine
¡¬720_patent_col. 3_ll._52 -56

the ¡¬720_patent teaches an inner_lipophilic_matrix and an outer_hydrophilic_matrix to address the limitations of the prior *1362 art systems.1 according to the ¡¬720_patent the combination of a lipophilic and hydrophilic_matrix in an inner-outer_matrix system respectively is advantageous because the inner-outer_matrix properties cause the mesalamine to be released in a sustained and uniform manner
¡¬720_patent_col. 3_ll._57 -59` [ t ] he compositions of the invention provide a release profile of [ mesalamine ] more homogenous than the traditional systems
`` ; see also id.at col. 3_l._60 -col. 4_l._5
the ¡¬720_patent also teaches the` advantageous characteristic' of a composition with up to 95 % active_ingredient by weight
id.at_col. 3_ll._52 -56

shire asserts independent claim 1 and dependent claim 3
claim 1 recites 1
controlled-release_oral_pharmaceutical_compositions containing as an active_ingredient [ mesal-amine ] comprising a an inner_lipophilic_matrix consisting of substances selected from the group consisting of unsaturated and/or hydrogenated fatty acid salts esters or amides thereof fatty acid_mono- di- or triglycerid [ e ] s waxes ceramides and cholesterol_derivatives with melting points below 90¢X_c. and wherein the active_ingredient is dispersed both in said the lipophilic_matrix and in the hydrophilic_matrix ; b an outer_hydrophilic_matrix wherein the lipophilic_matrix is dispersed and said outer_hydrophilic_matrix consists of compounds selected from the group consisting of polymers or copolymers of acrylic or methacrylic acid alkylvinyl polymers hydroxyalkyl celluloses carboxyalkyl celluloses polysaccharides dextrins pectins starches and derivatives alginic acid and natural or synthetic gums ; c optionally other excipients ; wherein the active_ingredient is present in an amount of 80_to_95 % by weight of the total composition and wherein the active_ingredient is dispersed both in the lipophilic_matrix and in the hydrophilic_matrix
id.at_col. 6_ll._7 -30
claim 3 depends from claim 1 and requires that the composition be in the form of tablets capsules or minitablets
id.at_col. 6_ll._35 -36

the ¡¬720_patent teaches a three-step process to arrive at the claimed composition
id.at_col. 2_ll._48 -59
first one or more low melting lipophilic_excipients2 are mixed with mesalamine during heating
id.at_col. 2_ll._50 -53
second the mixture is cooled to form the lipophilic_matrix and then reduced in size into` matrix granules containing the active_ingredient'
id.at_col. 2_ll._54 -56
third the lipophilic_matrix granules are mixed together with hydrophilic_excipients and compressed to form tablets
id.at_col. 2_ll._50 -53 col. 3_ll._40 -45

during prosecution of the ¡¬720_patent the examiner initially rejected the applicants claims as obvious in view of gb 2_245_492 a franco ; obvious and anticipated in view of u.s._patent_no._5593,690 akiyama ; and obvious in view of the combination of u.s._patent_no._5851,555 sanghvi and u.s._patent_no._6395,300 straub
j.a
15469-71
the examiner explained that franco taught a pharmaceutical composition with an active core a *1363 lipophilic coating and a hydrophilic film
j.a
15469

in response the applicants stated that franco disclosed a reservoir_system where` the active_ingredient is confined within a core which acts as a reservoir from which the active_ingredient is released via the erosion of the outer coating
however as to the present invention the active_ingredient is dispersed in a lipophilic_matrix not in an isolated core'
j.a
15480-81

the applicants then distinguished akiyama based on the claimed inventions two matrices and high active_ingredient concentration
the applicants argued that akiyama` fail [ s ] to disclose or suggest the two matrices and the arrangement of the matrices as set forth in the claimed invention
the arrangement of the matrices in the present invention aid [ s ] in the combined release of an active_ingredient via diffusion from a lipophilic_matrix'
j.a
15479
the applicants also argued that akiyamas composition contained the` active_ingredient.. in an amount much lower than that according to the claimed invention' -akiyama taught an active_ingredient in granules in an amount ranging from 0.005-75 % by weight but the applicants amended claim taught 80-95 %
j.a
15478-79

to distinguish sanghvi and straub the applicants again focused on a lack of two separate_matrices sanghvi` fails to disclose a system containing two separate_matrices
[ it ] merely discloses formulations obtained by mixing together hydrophilic and lipophilic_substances into a single_matrix'
j.a
15481
when discussing the combination of sanghvi and straub the applicants explained that` [ w ] hile the publications might teach the advantageous_results of using a lipophilic_matrix the publications fail to disclose or suggest a composition comprising a combination of two separate_matrices
in fact there is no mention or suggestion of a composition utilizing different control mechanisms'
j.a
15482

the examiner maintained her rejection of the pending claims as obvious in view of franco
the examiner also rejected the claims because` the feature upon which applicant relies i.e. the active_ingredient is dispersed in a lipophilic_matrix is not recited in the rejected claims'
j.a
15489
further the examiner explained that the limitation-at-the-time-' active_ingredient is at least partly inglobated' -' does not limit the claim toactive_ingredient is dispersed in a lipophilic_matrix as alleged by the applicant'
j.a
15489

in response the applicants maintained that franco taught a reservoir_system but that the claimed invention` relates to amultimatrix system and not to a reservoir_system'
j.a
15492 ; see also j.a
15492` franco_et_al
do [ es ] not teach an inner_lipophilic_matrix or an outer_hydrophilic_matrix..
the composition taught by franco_et_al
is not based on an actual matrix`
the applicants also amended their claims to state that the active_ingredient is dispersed in the lipophilic_matrix and added a markush_group3 for both the inner_lipophilic_matrix and the outer_hydrophilic_matrix
j.a
15491-92 15496 15499
following an interview with the examiner the claims were amended to require the mesalamine to be dispersed in the outer_hydrophilic_matrix and not just the lipophilic_matrix
j.a
15546-50
the claims were then allowed and the ¡¬720_patent issued

*1364 when watson submitted its anda seeking fda approval to sell the bioequivalent of lialdathe_r shire sued watson for infringement of the ¡¬720_patent
in january 2013 the district_court construed several disputed terms including` inner_lipophilic_matrix' and` outer_hydrophilic_matrix'

the district_court held a bench trial in april 2013 and issued its opinion a month later finding that watsons anda_product infringed claims 1_and_3 of the ¡¬720_patent ; that the claims were not invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?

may_9,_2013
specifically the district_court determined that watsons anda_product met the limitations of the claims at issue
in considering the disputed limitations the district_court found that the mesalamine in watsons product was dispersed in both the lipophilic and hydrophilic matrices because the mesalamine was present in both the granules and the spaces outside the granules
shire 2013_wl_1912208 at *7-13
the district_court also determined that watson failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the patent was invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 for lack of written description or enablement

we review the district_courts ultimate interpretation of the patent_claims de novo
teva 135 s.ct.at 839 841-42
`` [ w ] hen the district_court reviews only evidence intrinsic to the patent the patent_claims and specifications along with the patents prosecution_history the judges determination will amount solely to a determination of law and [ we ] will review that construction de novo'
id.at 841
if on the other hand a district_court resolves factual disputes over evidence extrinsic to the patent we` review for clear_error those factual_findings that underlie a district_courts claim_construction'
id.at 842
in this case we review the district_courts constructions de novo as the intrinsic_evidence fully determines the proper constructions
see id.at 840-42 ; see also in re papst licensing digital camera patent litig. 778_f.3d_1255 1261 fed.cir.2015 citing teva 135 s.ct.at 840-42

when construing asserted claims claim_terms are given` their ordinary and accustomed meaning as understood by one of ordinary skill in the art'
dow chem co. v. sumitomo chem co. 257_f.3d_1364 1372 fed.cir.2001 ; phillips v. awh corp. 415_f.3d_1303 1312-13 fed.cir.2005 en banc

intrinsic evidence such as` the specification.. may shed contextual light' on the ordinary and customary_meaning of a claim_term
aventis pharm inc. v. amino chems ltd. 715_f.3d_1363 1373 fed.cir.2013
`` the construction that stays true to the claim_language and most naturally aligns with the patents description of the invention will be in the end the correct_construction'
phillips 415 f.3d at 1316

in addition to the specification this court looks to the prosecution_history
for example` where the patentee has unequivocally disavowed a certain meaning to obtain his patent the doctrine of prosecution_disclaimer attaches and narrows the ordinary_meaning of the claim congruent with the scope of the surrender'
omega eng g inc. v. raytek corp. 334_f.3d_1314 1324 fed.cir.2003 ; see *1365 ekchian v. home depot inc. 104_f.3d_1299 1304 fed.cir.1997` since by distinguishing the claimed invention over the prior_art an applicant is indicating what the claims do not cover he is by implication surrendering such protection'
`` however while the prosecution_history can inform whether the inventor limited the claim scope in the course of prosecution it often produces ambiguities created by ongoing negotiations between the inventor and the pto
therefore the doctrine of prosecution_disclaimer only applies to unambiguous_disavowals'
grober v. mako prods. inc. 686_f.3d_1335 1341 fed.cir.2012 citing abbott labs
v. sandoz inc. 566_f.3d_1282 1289 fed.cir.2009
we review the application of prosecution_disclaimer de novo
ecolab inc. v. fmc corp. 569_f.3d_1335 1342 fed.cir.2009

we have also held that a court may look to extrinsic evidence such as dictionaries and expert_testimony to` shed useful light on the relevant art' and for a variety of other purposes
phillips 415 f.3d at 1317-18 quoting c.r
bard inc. v. u.s. surgical corp. 388_f.3d_858 862 fed.cir.2004
but` a court should discount any expert_testimonythat is clearly at odds with the claim_construction mandated by the claims themselves the written description and the prosecution_history in other words with the written record of the patent
`` id.at 1318 quoting key pharm
v. hercon labs corp. 161_f.3d_709 716 fed.cir.1998

iii
the district_court construed` inner_lipophilic_matrix' to mean` a matrix including at least one lipophilic excipi-ent where the matrix is located within one or more other substances'
shire 2013_wl_174843 at *5
similarly the district_court construed` outer_hydrophilic_matrix' as` a matrix of at least one hydrophilic_excipient where the matrix is located outside the inner_lipophilic_matrix'
id
these constructions do not reflect the ordinary and customary_meaning of the claim_terms in light of the intrinsic_evidence and are impermissibly broad

a
when construing the disputed terms the district_court relied on the specification to first construe` matrix' to mean` a macroscopically homogeneous_structure in all its volume'
id.at *4 quoting ¡¬720_patent_col. 3_ll._42 -45
that construction is correct
but the district_court erred by construing`lipophilic_matrix [ as ] a matrix that includes at least one lipophilic_excipient'
id
that construction erroneously focuses on the lipophilic properties of an excipient in the matrix rather than the properties of the matrix itself

a review of the intrinsic_evidence as a whole reveals that the district_courts construction of` inner_lipophilic_matrix' -and thus` outer_hydrophilic_matrix' -is overly broad
looking first to the language of the claims` lipophilic' is an adjective that modifies matrix
the parties stipulated that` lipophilic' means` poor_affinity towards aqueous_fluids'
j.a
216
thus the matrix-not just an excipient within the matrix-must exhibit the stipulated-to lipophilic characteristic

this conclusion is bolstered by the specification
the background of the invention explains that a lipophilic_matrix is one` in which the main_component of the matrix_structure' exhibits certain lipophilic properties
¡¬720_patent_col. 1_ll._17 -20
and the specification teaches that a lipophilic_matrix` generally entail [ s ] non-linear but esponential [ sic ] release of the active_ingredient'
¡¬720_patent_col. 1_ll._32 -33
thus a` lipophilic_matrix` is more than just a matrix with at least one lipophilic_excipient-the matrix itself must exhibit *1366 lipophilic characteristics
the ¡¬720_patent teaches that this occurs when` the main_component of the matrix_structure' is lipophilic
¡¬720_patent_col. 1_ll._17 -18

b
in construing the matrix terms the district_court rejected watsons position that the inner_matrix and outer_matrix must be` separate and distinct'
shire 2013_wl_174843 at *5
watson based its arguments on alleged disclaimers by the applicants during the prosecution
see appellants br
37-38
the district_court acknowledged that the applicants described their matrices as` separate' to distinguish over the prior_art references but found that` no where in the prosecution_history claims or specification does the termseparate and distinct appear'
shire 2013_wl_174843 at *5
explaining that the prosecution_history is an ongoing negotiation and that there must be clear and unambiguous disavowal the district_court could not` say that the claim was clearly limited or disclaimed during the prosecution'
id

the district_court correctly found no prosecution_disclaimer because the statements in the prosecution_history were not` unambiguous_disavowals'
grober 686 f.3d at 1341
during prosecution shire carefully characterized the prior_art as not having separate_matrices but never actually stated that the claimed invention does have separate_matrices
see e.g. j.a
15482` while the publications might teach the advantageous_results of using a lipophilic_matrix the publications fail to disclose or suggest a composition comprising a combination of two separate_matrices'
( emphasis added
although the prosecution_history statements do not rise to the level of unmistakable disavowal they do inform the claim_construction

the prosecution_history the structure of the claim itself the ordinary_meaning of the claim_terms including the markush_group limitations and the patents description of the invention compel a claim_construction which requires that the inner_lipophilic_matrix is separate from the outer_hydrophilic_matrix
see phillips 415 f.3d at 1316

looking to the claim structure itself the claims require the inner_lipophilic_matrix to be separate if not distinct from the outer_hydrophilic_matrix
element a of claim 1 recites` an inner_lipophilic_matrix'
element b of claim 1 separately recites` an outer hydrophobic matrix'
the separation of these elements within the claims indicates that the claim requires two separate_matrices

shire even admits that the structure of the claim_language requires two separate_matrices
oral argument at 17:23-17:50 shire_dev. llc v. watson pharms. inc. no._2013-1409 fed
cir
dec._2,_2013 available at http // oralarguments.cafc.uscourts.gov/default.aspx ? fl=2013-1409.mp3 q` it sounds like then even though you opposed having the separate and distinct that you agree that there has to be two different_matrices ?
a correct separate yes..
theyre separate because by the claim itself it says an inner and an outer so were talking about two different_matrices
for sure one is lipophilic one is hydrophilic
theyre separate
no question
`` ; appellees br
34` [ t ] o the extent there is aseparation of matrices the claim_language addresses that by defining two matrices as opposed to one
``

moreover the logical reading of the claim requires separation between the matrices because the matrices are defined by mutually exclusive spatial characteristics-one inner one outer-and mutually exclusive compositional characteristics-one hydrophilic one lipophilic
according *1367 to the ordinary and customary_meanings of these characteristics one matrix can not be both inner and outer in relation to a second matrix
nor can one matrix be both hydrophilic and lipophilic
thus considering` matrix' is properly construed as` a macroscopically homogenous structure in all its volume' the construction of` inner_lipophilic_matrix' requires the inner_volume to be separate from the outer_volume
see phillips 415 f.3d at 1314` in some cases the ordinary_meaning of claim_language as understood by a person of skill in the art may be readily apparent even to lay judges and claim_construction in such cases involves little more than the application of the widely accepted meaning of commonly understood words
``

the compositions of the inner_volume and outer_volume i.e. inner_matrix and outer_matrix respectively are further limited by the markush_groups
during prosecution the applicants added markush_groups to claim 1 to overcome the examiners rejection of the claims as obvious over franco
j.a
15491-92
for example the inner_lipophilic_matrix is limited by a markush_group` consisting of unsaturated and/or hydrogenated fatty acid salts esters or amides thereof fatty acid_mono- di- or triglycer-id [ e ] s waxes ceramides and cholesterol_derivatives with melting points below 90¢X_c.' ¡¬720_patent_col. 6_ll._11 -14
the outer_hydrophilic_matrix is similarly limited by a markush_group consisting of hydrophilic components
see ¡¬720_patent_col. 6_ll._20 -25
the lack of overlap of the components of the two markush_groups supports the requirement that the volumes be separate
accordingly the correct_construction requires that the inner_volume contain substances from the group described for the inner_lipophilic_matrix which are all lipophilic_substances and that the outer_volume separately contain substances from the group described for the outer_hydrophilic_matrix which are all hydrophilic

the ¡¬720_patent specification also teaches` separate' matrices
the specification describes five examples of forming discrete lipophilic_matrix granules and compressing those granules together with the hydrophilic_matrix
see e.g. ¡¬720_patent_col. 3_ll._31 -45
the specification explains that a lipophilic_matrix` opposes some resistance to the penetration of the solvent due to the poor_affinity towards aqueous_fluids'
¡¬720_patent_col. 1_ll._17 -20
and under the stipulated meaning of` lipophilic' the lipophilic_matrix must have a` poor_affinity towards aqueous_fluids'
j.a
216
thus the matrix that is deemed the` lipophilic' matrix can not have hydrophilic_properties
but a matrix comprised of only one lipophilic_substance and several hydrophilic_substances-and thus capable of exhibiting hydrophilic_properties-would meet the district_courts construction of` lipophilic_matrix'
such a result contradicts the customary and ordinary_meaning of` lipophilic' and` hydrophilic'

furthermore under the district_courts construction a single_mixed_matrix with both hydrophilic and lipophilic components-such as the one disclosed in the sanghvi reference which the applicants described as` mixing together hydrophilic and lipophilic_substances into a single_matrix' -could contain both an` inner_lipophilic_matrix' and an` outer_hydrophilic_matrix'
j.a
15481
indeed any arbitrarily selected volume in a single_mixed_matrix would satisfy the district_courts construction of` inner_lipophilic_matrix' because that volume would necessarily contain` at least one lipophilic_excipient' and it would be` inside' the surrounding volume
similarly under the district_courts construction that same arbitrarily selected volume would constitute an` outer_hydrophilic_matrix' because it would contain *1368` at least one hydrophilic_excipient' and would be` outside' the inner_lipophilic_matrix
the claims however require two matrices with a defined spatial relationship

shire argues that the intrinsic_evidence does not describe any particular degree of separation and thus such a construction would create ambiguity
shires argument misses the point
a court must identify` [ t ] he construction that stays true to the claim_language and most naturally aligns with the patents description of the invention'
phillips 415 f.3d at 1316
whether or not a composition infringes when there is a trace of hydrophilic molecules in the inner_volume because of the mixing step inherent in the manufacturing process for example is a question for the fact finder
that this question may need to be resolved does not compel a claim_construction that departs from the customary and ordinary_meaning of the claims i.e. that the matrices must be` separate' such that they retain their claimed properties and are consistent with their respective_markush_group_limitations

c. on remand from the supreme_court shire argues that because the district_court` heard' testimony from various expert witnesses during a markman hearing and at trial we must defer to the district_courts constructions of the appealed terms
see e.g. appellees suppl
br
1

the supreme_court held that we` should review for clear_error those factual_findings that underlie a district_courts claim_construction'
teva 135 s.ct.at 842
the court did not hold that a deferential standard of review is triggered any time a district_court hears or receives extrinsic evidence
see id
here there is no indication that the district_court made any factual_findings that underlie its constructions of` inner_lipophilic_matrix' and` outer_hydrophilic_matrix'
see j.a
4566-67

iv
accordingly we reverse the district_courts constructions of` inner_lipophilic_matrix' and` outer_hydrophilic_matrix' and its subsequent infringement determination and we remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion

reversed and remanded
