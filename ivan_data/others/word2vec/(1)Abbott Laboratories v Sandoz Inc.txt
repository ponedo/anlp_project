this appeal is from the grant of a preliminary_injunction pending final resolution of the several challenges raised by sandoz inc. to the validity enforceability and infringement of the abbott_laboratories_patents in suit.1 we conclude that abuse of discretion has not been shown in the district_courts decision to grant the injunction_pendente_lite
that decision is affirmed

background
this suit concerns two abbott_laboratories_patents on extended_release_formulations of the antibiotic drug clarithromycin sold by abbott with the brand name biaxinthe_rxl
the patent on clarithromycin itself expired in 2005 ; only extended_release_formulations are at issue
the purpose of the extended_release_formulation is to extend the period of drug effectiveness after ingestion and thereby to reduce the requisite frequency of dosage
sandoz filed an abbreviated new drug application anda for its extended_release_formulation of clarithromycin ; the food and drug administration approved the anda on august 25 2005 and on september 16 2005 abbott filed suit in the united_states_district_court for the northern_district of illinois charging sandoz with infringement of united_states patent_no._6010,718 the ¡¬718_patent and patent_no._6551,616 the ¡¬616_patent
abbott also charged infringement *1344 of patent_no._6872,407 but has withdrawn this patent from suit

the ¡¬718_patent_claims an extended_release_pharmaceutical_composition comprising an erythromycin_derivative and a pharmaceutically acceptable_polymer whereby after ingestion certain specified parameters of drug bioavailability are met
claims 1 4 and 6 of the ¡¬718_patent are in suit 1
a pharmaceutical_composition for extended_release of an erythromycin_derivative in the gastrointestinal_environment comprising an erythromycin_derivative and from about 5 to about 50 % by weight of a pharmaceutically acceptable_polymer so that when ingested orally the composition induces statistically significantly lower_mean_fluctuation_index in the plasma than an immediate_release_composition of the erythromycin_derivative while maintaining bioavailability substantially equivalent to that of the immediate_release_composition of the erythromycin_derivative
4
a pharmaceutical_composition for extended_release of an erythromycin_derivative in the gastrointestinal_environment comprising an erythromycin_derivative and from about 5 to about 50 % by weight of a pharmaceutically acceptable_polymer so that upon oral_ingestion maximum_peak_concentrations of the erythromycin_derivative are lower than those produced by an immediate_release_pharmaceutical_composition and area under the concentration-time curve and the minimum plasma concentrations are substantially equivalent to that of the immediate_release_pharmaceutical_composition
6
an extended_release_pharmaceutical_composition comprising an erythromycin_derivative and a pharmaceutically acceptable_polymer the composition having an improved taste profile as compared to the immediate_release_formulation
the ¡¬616_patent is a continuation-in-part of the ¡¬718_patent with claims directed to the method of reducing gastrointestinal_side_effects
claim 2 is in suit shown with claim 1 from which it depends 1
a method of reducing gastrointestinal_adverse_side_effects comprising administering an effective_amount of extended_release_pharmaceutical_composition comprising an erythromycin_derivative and a pharmaceutically acceptable_polymer
2
the method according to claim 1 wherein the erythromycin_derivative is clarithromycin
in response to the charge of infringement sandoz presented the defenses of invalidity based on anticipation and obviousness unenforceability based on inequitable_conduct and noninfringement
this appeal is from the district_courts grant of abbotts motion for a preliminary_injunction preserving the status_quo during the pendency of this litigation
sandoz challenges the district_courts rulings on all issues

i. validity issues
the district_court reviewed the factors relevant to the grant or denial of a preliminary_injunction viz. 1 likelihood of success on the merits of the underlying litigation 2 whether irreparable_harm is likely if the injunction is not granted 3 the balance of hardships as between the litigants and 4 factors of the public_interest
see oakley inc. v. sunglass hut int l 316_f.3d_1331 1338-39 fed.cir.2003 ; h.h
robertson_co. v. united_steel_deck inc. 820_f.2d_384 387-88 fed.cir.1987
at the stage of the preliminary_injunction before the issues of fact and law have been fully explored and finally resolved` [ t ] he *1345 purpose of a preliminary_injunction is merely to preserve the relative positions of the parties until a trial on the merits can be held'

on appellate_review of the grant of a preliminary_injunction the question` is simply whether the issuance of the injunction constituted an abuse of discretion'
doran v. salem inn 422_u.s._922 932 95_s.ct._2561 45_l.ed.2d_648_(1975)
`` it is well settled that the granting of a temporary injunction pending final_hearing is within the sound discretion of the trial_court ; and that upon appeal an order granting such an injunction will not be disturbed unless contrary to some rule of equity or the result of improvident exercise of judicial discretion'
deckert v. independence shares corp. 311_u.s._282 290 61_s.ct._229 85_l.ed._189_(1940)
abuse of discretion is established` by showing that the court made a clear_error of judgment in weighing relevant_factors or exercised its discretion based upon an error of law or clearly erroneous factual findings'

see_cybor_corp. v. fas_technologies inc. 138_f.3d_1448 1460 fed.cir.1998 en banc` a district_court abuses its discretion when its decision is based on clearly erroneous_findings of fact is based on erroneous_interpretations of the law or is clearly unreasonable arbitrary or fanciful
``

sandoz assigns legal_error to the district_courts rulings that abbott is likely to prevail on the issues of validity infringement and inequitable_conduct and states that the district_court abused its discretion in balancing the equities and granting the injunction

anticipation
`` anticipation' in patent usage means that the claimed invention was previously known and described in a printed publication explicitly or inherently
anticipation is established by documentary evidence and requires that every claim_element and limitation is set forth in a single_prior_art_reference in the same form and order as in the claim
see in re omeprazole patent litigation 483_f.3d_1364 1373 fed.cir.2007 ; continental can co. v. monsanto_co. 948_f.2d_1264 1267 fed.cir.1991
an anticipating reference must enable that which it is asserted to anticipate
omeprazole 483 f.3d at 1378` toanticipate the identical subject_matter must not only be previously known but the knowledge must be sufficiently enabling to place the information in the possession of the public
`` ; elan_pharmaceuticals inc. v. mayo found

& research 346_f.3d_1051 1054 fed.cir.2003 same

sandoz argued that the ¡¬718_patent is anticipated by european patent publication no._0280,571 b1 the ¡¬571_publication which describes` a sustained_release_matrix_formulation in tablet form comprising from 0.1 % by weight to 90 % by weight of an antimicrobial agent selected from.. erythromycin.. from 5 % by weight to 29 % by weight of a hydrophilic_polymer and from 0.5 % by weight to 25 % by weight of an acrylic_polymer..' the ¡¬571_publication states that hydrophilic_polymers such as hydroxypropylmethyl_cellulose hpmc can be used to form a hydrophilic matrix which` respond [ s ] to increases in ph with a corresponding increase in the permeability of the dosage_form'
sandoz argued in the district_court that although the ¡¬571_publication does not mention clarithromycin or the specific pharmacokinetic_limitations in the ¡¬718_patent_claims the ¡¬571_publication anticipates the ¡¬718_claims because clarithromycin is an erythromycin_derivative and the claimed pharmacokinetic_limitations are inherent in the extended_release_compositions of the ¡¬571_publication
sandoz also argued that enablement *1346 of the compositions in the ¡¬571_publication must be presumed because the compositions in the ¡¬718_patent are presumed to be enabled and according to sandoz are identical

abbott responded that the ¡¬571_publication can not` anticipate' because it does not show the elements of the claims of issue ; it does not mention clarithromycin it does not disclose the pharmacokinetic_criteria stated in the ¡¬718_claims and it does not enable these limitations either expressly or inherently
abbott argued that significant experimentation would be required to ascertain the applicability of any release_agent from the large number of release_agents mentioned in the ¡¬571_publication particularly as applied to a different biological product having different dissolution and metabolic characteristics
thus abbott argued that the legal criteria of` anticipation' are not met by the ¡¬571_publication

the district_court found that sandoz did not present evidence sufficient to support its argument that` the ¡¬571_publications teachings would enable abbott to create an extended_release of an erythromycin_derivative drug simply based on the structural_limitations'
abbott 500 f.supp.2d at 840
the district_court observed that the ¡¬571_publication` does not offer any in vivo dissolution data' nor state` the pharmacokinetic profile of its own formulations'
id
the court concluded that sandoz would not be likely to succeed in establishing anticipation by this reference
we discern no clear_error in this conclusion for the ¡¬571_publication neither describes the product of the ¡¬718_claims nor enables the pharmacokinetic_properties that are set forth in the ¡¬718_claims
see elan_pharmaceuticals 346 f.3d at 1057 an anticipating reference must disclose every element of the claims and place a person of ordinary_skill in possession of the claimed invention

obviousness
sandoz also argued that the claims of the ¡¬781 and ¡¬616_patent_s are invalid on the ground of obviousness in view of the combination of the ¡¬571_publication with pct_application wo 95/30422 the pct or ¡¬422 application and united_states patent no._5705,190 the ¡¬190_patent

in determining for preliminary_injunction_purposes the likelihood that patent invalidity would be established at trial the district_court evaluates the factual and legal arguments in light of the presumptions and burdens that will inhere at trial viz. that` [ a ] patent shall be presumed valid..
the burden of establishing invalidity of a patent or any claim thereof shall rest on the party asserting such invalidity'
35 u.s.c.¡± 282
this burden` exists at every stage of the litigation'
canon computer systems inc. v. nu-kote int l inc. 134_f.3d_1085 1088 fed.cir.1998 ; see sanofi-synthelabo v. apotex inc. 470_f.3d_1368 1374 fed.cir.2006 taking into account the applicable presumptions and burdens in reviewing the grant of a preliminary_injunction
sandoz on this appeal relies on the supreme_courts decision in ksr international co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007) sandoz arguing that the law of obviousness has been significantly changed and that the district_court did not give adequate recognition to the changed law
the district_court had issued its initial_decision granting the preliminary_injunction shortly before the courts decision in ksr
the court then requested supplemental_briefing and argument and issued a further opinion discussing the issues in light of ksr and continuing to conclude that abbott was likely to prevail on the merits of the question of obviousness

in its initial_decision the district_court discussed the references in detail
the *1347 court explained that the pct_application entitled` controlled-release dosage forms of azithromycin' describes` [ a ] dosage_form for oral administration comprising azithromycin and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which releases not more than about 10 % of its incorporated azithromycin into a mammals stomach and which releases not more than an additional 10 % during the first 15 minutes after entering said mammals duodenum' and exhibits decreased gastrointestinal_side_effects
the district_court explained that the pct_application shows hydroxypropylmethylcellulose hpmc and other_polymers as` a hydrophilic_polymer sufficient to provide a useful degree of control over the azithromycin dissolution' and contains in vitro data showing the amount and timing of dissolution of azithromycin in various_conditions and sustained dosage_forms

sandoz argued that these teachings should be combined with those of the ¡¬571_publication and the ¡¬190_patent entitled` controlled release formulation for poorly soluble basic drugs' which describes a` controlled release solid pharmaceutical_composition adapted for oral administration comprising a therapeutically effective_amount of at least one basic_drug having a water solubility of less than 1 part per 30 parts water.. wherein the basic_drug is a macrolide' and as the release_agent a water-soluble alginate_salt
the ¡¬190_patent names the macrolides erythromycin clarithromycin dirithromycin azithromycin roxithromycin and abt-229 for use with the alginate_salt release_agent
sandoz argued that the subject_matter of the ¡¬718_patent would have been obvious in view of the ¡¬ 571 publication showing extended_release_formulations of erythromycin_derivatives in combination with the controlled release_formulations and pharmacokinetic_properties of azithromycin in the pct_application and the modified release alginate_salt formulation of clarithromycin in the ¡¬190_patent
sandoz argued that a person of ordinary_skill in this field would have desired to improve the administration of clarithromycin by finding an extended_release_formulation having optimum release and biological_properties and would have selected and tested the hpmc from the ¡¬571_publication in view of the formulation of azithromycin with hpmc in the pct_application and the ¡¬190_patents use of an alginate_salt to modify the release of clarithromycin
sandoz stressed that the pct_application states the known principle of using controlled release_formulations to reduce the dosing frequency for short half-life compounds
sandoz argued that no more than routine_experimentation was needed to find a controlled release_formulation that would meet the pharmacokinetic_requirements stated in the ¡¬718_claims

sandoz applied similar arguments to the claims of the ¡¬616_patent stating that the pct_application teaches that control of azithromycin release reduces gastrointestinal_side_effects and that the ¡¬190_patent shows the interchangeability of azithromycin and clarithromycin in the formulation using an alginate_salt
sandoz argued that this combination of references renders obvious a clarithromycin_formulation with reduced gastrointestinal_side_effects as claimed in the ¡¬616_patent
in its supplemental argument based on ksr sandoz argued that abbott merely` pursue [ d ] known options' for both the ¡¬718 and ¡¬616_patent_s based on the courts exposition that` when there is a design_need or market_pressure to solve a problem and there are a finite_number of identified predictable_solutions a person of ordinary_skill has good_reason to pursue the known options within his or her technical_grasp'
ksr 127 s.ct.at 1742

in the district_court abbott disputed the premises presented by sandoz challenged *1348 the analysis of the content and significance of the references and argued that ksr did not hold as sandoz proposed that the recognition of a problem of itself renders the solution obvious
abbott argued that more is needed than recognizing the problem as this court discussed in cardiac pacemakers inc. v. st. jude medical inc. 381_f.3d_1371 1377 fed.cir.2004` recognition of a need does not render obvious the achievement that meets that need..
recognition of an unsolved problem does not render the solution obvious'
abbott pointed out that the court qualified its discussion by explaining that the` problem' should have` a finite_number of identified predictable_solutions' ksr 127 s.ct.at 1742 to expose its eventual solution to unpatentability as` obvious to try'
id
abbott stressed the difference between new biological compositions whose performance and effectiveness in combination can not be confidently predicted but must be made and evaluated and new mechanical combinations of known elements each of which predictably performs its known function in the combination

abbott stressed that its choice of extended_release components is not shown or suggested by the prior_art to produce the pharmacokinetic_properties of abbotts claims
the court recognized in dennison mfg co. v. panduit corp. 475_u.s._809 106_s.ct._1578 89_l.ed.2d_817_(1986) that the district_court is not to rely on hindsight and that` in addressing the question of obviousness a judge must not pick and choose isolated elements from the prior_art and combine them so as to yield the invention in question if such a combination would not have been obvious at the time of the invention'
475 u.s. at 810 106_s.ct._1578
in graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966) the court recognized that the obviousness inquiry must` guard against slipping into use of hindsight and to resist the temptation to read into the prior_art the teachings of the invention in issue'
id.at 36 86_s.ct._684

abbott agreed that the basic principles of pharmacokinetics were known but argued that the limitations in the ¡¬718_claims whereby the bioavailability of the product was characterized were not shown as achieved in any reference or any combination of references
abbott pointed out that the pct_application is directed specifically to azithromycin and shows` scores' of possible formulations all using in vitro data and does not contemplate metabolite activity in vivo as is manifested for chlorithromycin
abbott stated that` the ¡¬422_publication discloses more than a dozen possible classes of delivery devices' abbott brief at 42 that` the ¡¬422_publication merely provides in vitro dissolution data for a subset of its disclosed compositions' and that the formulation in the pct_application` did not even have equivalent_bioavailability as ir [ immediate_release ] azithromycin'
id.at 41 86_s.ct._684

abbott described in the ¡¬718 and ¡¬616 specifications that the ¡¬190_patent_reference presents` c max values [ that ] are not statistically significantly different from those of the ir_formulation'
¡¬718_patent col. 2 lines 11-12 ; ¡¬616_patent col. 2 lines 13-14 referring to ser
no._0 8/574,877 the ¡¬190_patent
abbott stated that sandoz concedes that the ¡¬190_patent does not describe pharmacokinetic_limitations based on clarithromycin plasma concentrations and that neither the pct_application nor the ¡¬190_patent discloses the pharmacokinetic_limitations and properties set forth in the ¡¬718 and ¡¬616 claims and that neither the pct_application nor any other reference provides guidance as to which formulation would provide the pharmacokinetic characteristics required by the ¡¬718_claims

thus abbott argued in the district_court that a skilled_artisan would not have known the effect of substituting clarithromycin *1349 for azithromycin in any specific formulation that might be selected from the pct_application for it is undisputed that there are significant differences among erythromycin_derivatives
abbott presented evidence to the district_court that azithromycin and clarithromycin exhibit different properties in four biological processes of relevance to oral drug administration absorption distribution metabolism and excretion

supplemental_declaration of dr._davis february 7 2007
the parties do not dispute that the pct_application describes only in vitro data and that in vitro data are not predictably transferable to in vivo conditions
dr._davis testified that` it simply is n't the case that in vitro controlled release_data will automatically correlate with the pharmacokinetic_parameters in vivo and in fact for many of the formulations of the ¡¬422 application they affirmatively do not so correlate'
id

the district_court concluded that a person of ordinary_skill in this field would not have predicted which formulation that might be selected from the prior_art would provide the required pharmacokinetics
the district_court referred to the dissimilarities in the pharmacokinetic_properties for azithromycin as shown in the pct_application considered the content of the ¡¬ 190 patent and concluded that the bioavailability of the formulations claimed in the ¡¬718_patent were not predictable from these references
the court referred to the testimony of another abbott expert dr. daniel weiner that` the ¡¬190_patent does not disclose any clarithromycin-specific pk [ pharmacokinetic ] data' or` any dfl [ degree of fluctuation ] 2 values at all'
declaration of daniel weiner ph.d. january 9 2007
dr._weiner explained that the pk values reported in the ¡¬190_patent are based on total_antibiotic_activity which consists of the combined concentrations of clarithromycin and its active_metabolite while the pharmacokinetic elements of the ¡¬718_patent relate specifically to clarithromycin plasma concentrations
dr._weiner concluded and the district_court agreed that a skilled_artisan would not have had a reasonable_expectation of producing effective compositions based on the mention of clarithromycin along with azithromycin in the ¡¬190_patent because of their different mechanisms of antibiotic activity and the effect of this activity on pharmacokinetic behavior

the district_court observed that the in vivo azithromycin controlled release_formulations in the pct_application have less total bioavailability than their immediate_release counterparts supporting abbotts argument that the behavior of differing biological systems even when structurally similar is not predictable
see alza corp. v. mylan laboratories 464_f.3d_1286 1297 fed.cir.2006` alzas evidence of in vitro dissolution *1350 rates is irrelevant absent evidence demonstrating that the in vitro system is a good model of actual in vivo behavior`
the district_court concluded that the in vivo extended_release properties claimed in the ¡¬718_patent are sufficiently dissimilar to or unpredictable from the in vitro controlled release_data for azithromycin in the pct_application that a person of ordinary_skill in the field of the invention would not have had the degree of confidence of success in transferring the pct_applications azithromycin formulation to the different metabolic and solubility systems of clarithromycin as would render the ¡¬718 claimed invention unpatentable on the ground of obviousness

in reaching these conclusions the district_court relied on the federal_circuits decision on the same patents in abbott_laboratories v. andrx_pharmaceuticals inc. 473_f.3d_1196_(fed.cir.2007) herein` andrx'
this court sustaining the district_courts grant of a preliminary_injunction had concluded that obviousness was not likely to be established reversing this courts prior ruling reversing the grant of a preliminary_injunction in abbott_laboratories v. andrx_pharmaceuticals inc. 452_f.3d_1331_(fed.cir.2006) herein` teva'
sandoz argued to the district_court that the federal_circuits ruling in andrx is incorrect and on this appeal_sandoz urges us to reject andrx and reinstate teva

in teva a panel of this court held that the claims of the ¡¬718_patent were likely to be held not infringed
this court also stated that there was a substantial_likelihood that claim 4 of the ¡¬718_patent would be held invalid for obviousness based on the pct_application together with the ¡¬190_patent
this court held that the preliminary_injunction should be denied although the panel cautioned that its ruling` in no way resolves the ultimate question of invalidity'
teva 452 f.3d at 1347
in andrx a later panel of this court on an enlarged record rejected the invalidity ruling in teva and held that the ¡¬718_claims were likely to withstand the attack on validity
andrx 473 f.3d at 1203-07

reviewing this history as applied to sandoz arguments herein the district_court explained that this court in teva had not been made aware of the differences between the pharmacokinetic_criteria described in the ¡¬190_patent and those of the ¡¬718_patent
the district_court explained that the pharmacokinetic data in the ¡¬190_patent were based on measurements of total_antibiotic_activity in the body which includes both clarithromycin and its active_metabolite formed after ingestion whereas the data in the ¡¬718_patent are specific to clarithromycin alone
the court found that` abbott has shown.. that the pk_profile of the clarithromycin-metabolite data of the ¡¬190_patent formulation was not the same as the pk_profile of the clarithromycin-only data utilized by the ¡¬718_patent' abbott 500 f.supp.2d at 841

sandoz argued in its supplemental_briefing in the district_court after the ksr decision that this courts decision in andrx does not survive scrutiny under the principles set forth in ksr and stressed that application of ksr renders it` obvious to try' the various release_agents in the pct_application such that any successful composition would be unpatentable whether or not the results were predictable
sandoz argued that the ¡¬190_patent shows that clarithromycin and azithromycin have similarities as well as differences and that it would be obvious to experiment to determine which formulations were effective in view of these differences and similarities
sandoz stressed that the abbott scientists had knowledge of the prior_art including the pct_application and that they developed the abbott formulation in only one month of research effort
sandoz quoted the courts admonition in ksr that a *1351 court` can take account of the inferences and creative steps that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would employ' 127 s.ct.at 1741 and that` [ t ] he combination of familiar elements according to known methods is likely to be obvious when it does no more than yield predictable results'
id.at 1739

the district_court applying ksr reconsidered its prior determination and framed the question as` whether an ordinary person skilled in the art would have seen a benefit to combining an erythromycin_derivative with a polymer with the same pk [ pharmacokinetic ] limitations as embodied in claims 1_and_4 of the ¡¬718_patent given the state of the pharmaceutical industry at the time'
abbott 500 f.supp.2d at 851
the court concluded` based upon what evidence and argument sandoz offered the answer was and remains no'
id
the district_court explained that` this courts preliminary factual findings.. found that sandoz had not produced evidence indicating that the pk_limitations were disclosed in the prior_art or were inherent to the structural_limitations of the prior_art_compositions'
id.at 852
the district_court observed that` [ t ] he ksr_opinion only focused on the federal_circuits strict use of the tsm [ teaching suggestion motivation ] test in performing the obviousness analysis ; it did not mention or affect the requirement that each and every claim_limitation be found present in the combination of the prior_art_references before the analysis proceeds'
id.at 852

we agree that the obviousness of selection of components when there is no prediction in the prior_art as to the results obtainable from a selected component differs from the issue in ksr where the court provided guidance that` a court must ask whether the improvement is more than the predictable use of prior_art elements according to their established functions'
127 s.ct.at 1740
the court explained the conditions in which` obvious to try' may negate patentability depending on the relation of the prior_art teaching to the later-developed technology
the court explained that when the problem is known the possible approaches to solving the problem are known and finite and the solution is predictable through use of a known option then the pursuit of the known option may be obvious even absent a` teaching suggestion or motivation' concerning that option
then` if this leads to the anticipated success it is likely the product not of innovation but of ordinary_skill and common_sense'
127 s.ct.at 1742

abbott argued that the` known options' in the prior_art were not` finite identified and predictable' the words of ksr and are identified only with hindsight knowledge of abbotts new formulation and its pharmacokinetic_properties
abbott pointed to the discussion in the pct_application of over a dozen possible drug delivery modes including matrix systems membrane-moderated or reservoir systems osmotic pumps coated hydrogel tablets and multi particulates sustained_release_compositions with delayed-release layers ph-dependent coated tablets bursting osmotic core_devices bursting coated swelling core_devices ph-triggered bursting osmotic core_devices ph-triggered bursting coated swelling core_devices enzyme-triggered supported liquid membrane devices bacterially degradable coating devices and swelling plug devices all classes of controlled release for drug delivery systems each containing sub-classes and variations
pct app.at 8-38
the expert witnesses pointed out the difficulties in predicting the behavior of any composition in any specific biological system

the evaluation of the choices made by a skilled scientist when such choices lead to the desired result is a challenge to judicial *1352 understanding of how technical advance is achieved in the particular field of science or technology
such understanding is critical to judicial implementation of the national policy embodied in the patent statute
in publication of tomlinson 53_c.c.p.a._1421 363_f.2d_928_(1966) our predecessor court discussed the role of` obvious to try' in scientific and technologic research and in patentability slight reflection suggests we think that there is usually an element of` obviousness to try' in any research endeavor that is not undertaken with complete blindness but rather with some semblance of a chance of success and that patentability determinations based on that as the test would not only be contrary to statute but result in a marked deterioration of the entire patent system as an incentive to invest in those efforts and attempts which go by the name of` research'
id.at 931
the court in ksr did not create a presumption that all experimentation in fields where there is already a background of useful knowledge is` obvious to try' without considering the nature of the science or technology
the methodology of science and the advance of technology are founded on the investigators educated application of what is known to intelligent exploration of what is not known
each case must be decided in its particular context including the characteristics of the science or technology its state of advance the nature of the known choices the specificity or generality of the prior_art and the predictability of results in the area of interest

the district_court discussed the differences between the pharmacokinetic_properties shown in the ¡¬190_patent_reference and the properties in the ¡¬ 718 patent_claims the differences in the chemical and biological_properties of azithromycin and clarithromycin the differences between in vitro and in vivo data and the differences between azithromycin and clarithromycin
for example abbotts expert_dr._davis stated that` the absorption of clarithromycin is affected by a phenomenon know as thefirst pass effect which does not occur for azithromycin' and that azithromycins` metabolism occurs only post-absorption'
dr._davis also stated that` the half-life for azithromycin is about 70 hours whereas that for clarithromycin is about 3-4 hours at low ir doses'
first-pass metabolism was explained as meaning that a significant amount of the drug is metabolized and converted into another compound before it enters the circulation ; dr._davis stated that a person of skill in this field having this knowledge would not have assumed that the two drugs would exhibit similar behavior if placed in the same formulation
the district_court concluded that it was not predictable from the in vitro behavior of azithromycin how any specific clarithromycin extended_release_formulation would perform in vivo

sandoz presented other arguments for example that the fda regulations state the requirements for approval of extended_release_formulations thereby rendering obvious a formulation that meets these requirements
however knowledge of the goal does not render its achievement obvious
the district_court appropriately applied the ksr standard of whether the patents in suit represented an` identified predictable solution' and` anticipated success' the words of ksr to the problem of producing extended_release_formulations having the pharmacokinetic_properties in the claims

on the record of the preliminary_injunction proceedings and considering this courts ruling in andrx and the guidance of the court in ksr we do not discern reversible_error in the district_courts ruling that abbott is likely to prevail on the *1353 issues of patent validity based on anticipation and obviousness

ii
inequitable conduct
sandoz also argued that the ¡¬718 and ¡¬616_patent_s are unenforceable due to abbotts` inequitable_conduct' in the patent and trademark office
sandoz stated that abbott submitted a false declaration to the pto and also that abbott withheld from the examiner the results of certain tests after the patent_applications were filed and that were inconsistent with information in the patent_applications
the district_court found that there was no intent to deceive the examiner and that the criticized activity did not constitute inequitable_conduct

the evidentiary standard for determining whether there was inequitable_conduct in obtaining a patent that is otherwise valid was set forth by this court sitting en banc for the purpose in kingsdown medical consultants ltd. v. hollister inc. 863_f.2d_867_(fed.cir.1988)
the court explained that` [ t ] o be guilty of inequitable_conduct one must have intended to act inequitably' and held` inequitable conduct resides in failure to disclose material_information or submission of false_material_information with an intent to deceive and those two elements materiality and intent must be proven by clear and convincing_evidence'
id.at 872
mistake or negligence even gross_negligence does not support a ruling of inequitable_conduct
the court held we adopt the view that a finding that particular conduct amounts to` gross_negligence' does not of itself justify an inference of intent to deceive ; the involved conduct viewed in light of all the evidence including evidence indicative of good faith must indicate sufficient culpability to require a finding of intent to deceive
id.at 876
when both materiality and deceptive_intent have been established the district_court determines in the courts discretion whether inequitable_conduct has occurred ; appellate_review is on this basis
see id.at 876` as an equitable issue inequitable_conduct is committed to the discretion of the trial_court and is reviewed by this court under an abuse of discretion standard
we accordingly will not simply substitute our judgment for that of the trial_court in relation to inequitable_conduct
``

the ¡¬718_patent
sandoz first challenges the district_courts findings with respect to a declaration by an inventor dr. linda_gustavson comparing the products of the pending ¡¬718_application with the products in a prior_art abbott patent u.s. patent no._4808,411 directed to a pediatric clarithromycin suspension that is administered twice daily
dr._gustavson submitted data to the pto comparing the ¡¬718 and the ¡¬411 formulations and stated that` the er [ extended_release ] formulation as claimed is supported by the above results namely cmax of clarithromycin in plasma is statistically significantly lower than that for ir [ immediate_release ] formulation given twice daily'
the declaration also stated that` auc is maintained over 24 hours ; and cmin is substantially equivalent to that of the ir suspension'3 however in this litigation dr._gustavson testified that she had not analyzed statistical_significance and that` it could not definitively be concluded from the data that the difference between the er cmax and the cmax for a twice-a-day dosed suspension would have *1354 been statistically significantly different'
based on this admission sandoz argued that the gustavson submission to the pto was a material misrepresentation that intent to deceive is presumed and that inequitable_conduct was thereby established

abbott did not dispute that dr._gustavson did not analyze statistical_significance but argued that it was not material to patentability and that a reasonable_examiner would not have found otherwise
abbott pointed out that the actual data were before the pto and that the results did show a numerically lower_cmax_value
sandoz pointed out to the district_court that abbotts patent attorney argued nonobviousness to the pto based on the gustavson declaration and abbott responded that the declaration correctly stated that the pharmacokinetic_properties of the product in the ¡¬411_patent are markedly different from those of the product of the ¡¬718_patent
we have been directed to no evidence of deceptive_intent or` bad faith or intentional misconduct' in the words of pto rule 56 ; on this appeal_sandoz repeats that deceptive_intent should be inferred from the misstatement

the district_court cited impax labs. inc. v. aventis pharm. inc. 468_f.3d_1366 1374 fed.cir.2006 for its summary that a ruling of inequitable_conduct requires clear and convincing_evidence that the applicant while prosecuting the patent` 1 made an affirmative misrepresentation of material fact failed to disclose material_information or submitted false_material_information and 2 intended to deceive the [ pto ]'
in determining materiality the district_court applied the standard that` [ u ] ndisclosed information is material if it satisfies 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 and if there is a substantial_likelihood that a reasonable_examiner would have considered the undisclosed information important in deciding whether to allow the patent to issue'
although the federal_circuit has not always been consistent in defining` materiality' in accordance with the pto rules the principles are consistently directed to deceptive actions by patent applicants
in digital control inc. v. charles machine works 437_f.3d_1309_(fed.cir.2006) the court observed that four separate tests have been applied for materiality

the district_court applying the tests of materiality to the gustavson_statement about statistical_significance stated that it was` obviously troublesome that gustavson made her assertion without having actually performed the statistical test'
the district_court concluded that the gustavson_statement was not material to patentability` despite the fact that it satisfies the definition ofmaterial provided by 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 b'
the court stated that since 1 no claim of the ¡¬718_patent requires the extended_release_formulation to have a statistically significant_lower_cmax than the immediate_release_formulation ; 2 the data in fact shows the cmax of the extended_release_formulation to be lower albeit not statistically significantly lower than the cmax of the immediate_release_formulation ; and 3 the extended_release_formulation was in fact pharmacokinetically different from the immediate_release_suspension_formulation it is more likely than not that the pto would not have found the` statistically significantly lower' statement to be important
500 f.supp.2d at 822
relevant is the ruling in regents of the univ
of cal
v. eli_lilly & co. 119_f.3d_1559 1570 fed.cir.1997 that` information is material if a reasonable_examiner would have considered it important to the patentability of a claim'

the district_court also found that there was no evidence of intent to deceive the examiner
the court rejected sandozs argument that deceptive_intent is inferred *1355 from materiality alone for precedent requires independent proof of deceptive_intent
see kingsdown 863 f.2d at 872 intent to deceive the examiner into granting the patent is a separate and essential element of inequitable_conduct in the pto ; baker oil tools inc. v. geo vann inc. 828_f.2d_1558 1565 fed.cir.1987` the material facts upon which a holding of inequitable_conduct rests relate to both the intent of the actor and the materiality of the information`
weighing the materiality of the statement and the absence of evidence of intent to deceive we do not discern an abuse of discretion in the district_courts conclusion that inequitable_conduct was not established by the statement concerning statistical_significance

sandoz next challenged the fact that abbott did not provide to the patent_examiner the results of some clinical tests conducted after the ¡¬718_patent_application was filed that were reported to the fda and included on the biaxinthe_r xl product label
the test results relate to taste_perversion4 results in a later clinical_trial and a study comparing clarithromycin with azithromycin
sandoz stated that abbott should have provided the patent_examiners with these results and the product label which report tests wherein the immediate_release_formulation has a lower incidence of taste_perversion than the extended_release_formulation contrary to the information in the ¡¬718_patent
sandoz argued that the inventors knew or should have known of this discrepancy and thus that intent to deceive is established
abbott responded that the challenged taste tests were from dosages that were not directly comparable and that they did not change the correctness of the data in the patent_application
abbott presented the expert testimony of dr._davis that` the comparison between the taste_perversion incidence rate for biaxinthe_r ir and biaxinthe_r xl in the label does not relate to the invention disclosed and claimed in the ¡¬407_patent which is for a reduction in taste_perversion for the same total dose'
supplemental_declaration of professor_stanley_s._davis february 7 2007 emphases in original

the district_court concluded that the taste results met the materiality criteria of rule 56 but that a reasonable_examiner would not consider the information important in deciding whether to grant the patent
the court explained that a reasonable_examiner would compare data at comparable dosages and that the data were not comparable
although abbott and sandoz argued about whether the inventors knew or should have known of this discrepancy between this taste_data from the phase iii clinical_trial and the taste_data in the patent_application the district_court observed that there was no evidence of deliberate withholding of this information in order to deceive the patent_examiner
`` intent to deceive can not be inferred solely from the fact that information was not disclosed ; there must be a factual basis for a finding of deceptive_intent'
hebert v. lisle corp. 99_f.3d_1109 1115 1116 fed.cir.1996` to establish inequitable_conduct the information that is known to the applicant and not provided to the pto must be both material to patentability and withheld in order to deceive or mislead the examiner
`` ; molins plc v. textron inc. 48_f.3d_1172 1181 fed.cir.1995` while intent to deceive the pto may be found as a matter of inference from circumstantial_evidence circumstantial_evidence can not indicate merely gross_negligence
``

*1356 materiality is not evidence of intent which must be established as a separate factual element of a discretionary ruling of inequitable_conduct
the district_court finding that the factual premises of both materiality and intent to deceive were not established in connection with the taste_data did not abuse its discretion in declining to find inequitable_conduct on this ground

finally sandoz criticized abbotts failure to provide the pto with a study designated w98-268 done after the patent_application was filed which compared the pharmacokinetic values of clarithromycin upon administration under various_conditions
the district_court described the issue as` abbott claimed that the mean_dfl_values for a modified release version of clarithromycin claimed by a prior patent the ¡¬190_patent were substantially equal to the mean_dfl_values for the immediate_release version of clarithromycin' but` [ t ] he final report of study_w98-268 states that the modified release_formulation exhibited a statistically significantly lower mean dfl than that for the immediate_release_formulation'
500 f.supp.2d at 823
sandoz stated that abbott committed inequitable_conduct by failing to disclose these results to the pto

dr._weiner stated in his january 9 declaration that` the ¡¬190_patent does not disclose any clarithromycin-specific pk data' and` the ¡¬190_patent does not disclose any dfl_values at all' and explained that` subsequent studies conducted by abbott indicate that the commercial embodiment of the invention of the ¡¬190_patent does not have a statistically significantly lower dfl than the ir_formulation.. before the present litigation abbott had conducted five crossover studies in which the pharmacokinetic_parameters for clarithromycin i.e. clarithromycin specifically not clarithromycin combined with its metabolite were measured for both the mr [ modified release ] and ir_formulations w95-914 w95-195 w95-197 w98-268 [ the study that sandoz accuses abbott of withholding ] and tai-99-001'
the mean_dfl_values in table_vii in the ¡¬718_patent are based on study_w95-195
see supplemental_declaration of dr. ronald sawchuk february 7 2007` table_vii reflects data from a multiple dose study involving mr formulation and an ir_formulation that was conducted in germany in 1995
see ex
12 study_w95-195`
the studies conducted before the ¡¬718_patent_application was filed showed the data reported in the specification

many details were explained to the district_court as to all the studies their context and their relationship
the district_court found that` contrary to sandozs assertion study_w98-268 does not demonstrate that the prior_art mr formulation has the same_pk_properties as that claimed for the er_formulation
therefore study_w98-268 is not material to the patentability of the ¡¬718_patent'
abbott 500 f.supp.2d at 824
the district_court found that the ¡¬718_patent` speaks of the pk relationship of extended_release and immediate_release_formulations not of modified release and immediate_release_formulations.. [ and ] there is no evidence showing the dfl of the er_formulation to be anything but consistently statistically significantly lower than the dfl of the ir_formulation'
id
the district_court found that the w98-268 study was not material under either rule 56 or the reasonable_examiner standard
clear_error has not been shown in this finding

on the preliminary_injunction record the district_court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that sandoz was not likely to succeed in establishing inequitable_conduct in abbotts prosecution of the ¡¬718_patent_application
we agree with the district *1357 court that the scales do not` tilt towards finding inequitable_conduct'
id.at 829

the ¡¬616_patent
sandoz argued that inequitable_conduct as to the taste_perversion_claim in the ¡¬718_patent taints the ¡¬616_patent because a taste_perversion_claim was included in the ¡¬616 application when it was filed although that claim was cancelled before any pto examination on the merits
the district_court declined to hold the ¡¬616_patent unenforceable based on a withdrawn claim citing 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 a rule 56 a
the duty to disclose information exists with respect to each pending claim until the claim is cancelled or withdrawn from consideration or the application becomes abandoned
information material to the patentability of a claim that is cancelled or withdrawn from consideration need not be submitted if the information is not material to the patentability of any claim remaining under consideration in the application
the district_court deemed it` wholly inequitable to hold a patent to be invalid for fraudulent conduct in the prosecution of a claim that was withdrawn before actual prosecution had even begun'
abbott 500 f.supp.2d at 829
this court held in scripps clinic & research found
v. genentech inc. 927_f.2d_1565 1583 fed.cir.1991 that` [ a ] reference that is material only to withdrawn claims can not be the basis of a holding of inequitable_conduct'
rule 56 is in accord

sandoz also argued as to the ¡¬616_patent that abbott did not report to the pto the results of clinical_trials conducted before the continuation in-part ¡¬ 616 application was filed
sandoz expert dr. marcello pagano in his declaration dated january 25 2007 stated` i have reviewed the bronchitis and sinusitis studies [ and ] the claims of the ¡¬616_patent for a method of reducing gastrointestinal_adverse_side_effects are not supported by the data from those two clinical studies'
the results of these studies were provided to the fda but not to the pto
dr. pagano stated` since neither the sinusitis nor the bronchitis studies produced favorable results to support a claimed reduction in gastrointestinal_adverse_side_effects abbott had to manipulate its data and report the number of discontinuations due to gastrointestinal_adverse_side_effects to the pto..' the district_court found that the information from these clinical_trials was not material to patentability stating that` it is clear from both table vi and table_viii [ of the ¡¬616_patent ] that some data demonstrating no change in the subcategories of gi adverse side effects of abdominal pain constipation diarrhea dyspepsia flatulence and nausea were in fact disclosed to the pto'
abbott 500 f.supp.2d at 828
these findings have not been shown to be clearly erroneous

there was no evidence of intent to deceive with respect to the results of these clinical_trials
materiality even if found does not establish intent
this is not a case of new information that affects the fundamental invention ; this is a case of challenging every action or inaction of the` conduct' of patent solicitation although patentability is unaffected
the purpose of kingsdown was to bring patent_practice into the mainstream of the law and administrative practice
the law severely punishes fraudulent practices and the patent_practice includes recognition that the inventor usually knows more about the field than does the` expert' patent_examiner
however routine actions that do not affect patentability and that are devoid of fraudulent intent are not subject to a different standard than other inquiries into fraudulent procurement
the administrative procedure act governs patent examination see dickinson v. zurko 527_u.s._150 119_s.ct._1816 144_l.ed.2d_143_(1999) *1358 and actions of patent_examiners are reviewed with recognition of examiner expertise so well as recognition of the occasionally imperfect examination process
`` it was to mitigate theplague whereby every patentees imperfections were promoted toinequitable_conduct that this court reaffirmed that both materiality and culpable intent must be established'
allied colloids inc. v. american cyanamid co. 64_f.3d_1570 1578 fed.cir.1995

we conclude that the district_court did not abuse its discretion in holding that the ¡¬718 and ¡¬616_patent_s were not likely to be held unenforceable based on inequitable_conduct in obtaining the patents

iii
infringement
the first step in most infringement suits is the procedure called` claim_construction' where the scope of the claim is defined by the court
at the preliminary_injunction_stage the district_courts claim_construction is reviewed as for other legal issues for the likelihood of correctness of the ruling
this likelihood is based on the underlying facts as found at this stage of the proceedings recognizing that` the burdens at the preliminary_injunction_stage track the burdens at trial'
gonzales v. o centro espirita beneficente uniao do vegetal 546_u.s._418 429 126_s.ct._1211 163_l.ed.2d_1017_(2006)

for the patents here in suit the issue of infringement was resolved at this preliminary_injunction_stage as a matter of claim_construction
the dispositive question was whether the term` pharmaceutically acceptable_polymer' is limited to the polymers named in the specification or can include other pharmaceutically acceptable_polymers
if so limited it is likely that there would not be literal_infringement ; if not so limited then literal_infringement would be possible
( infringement under the doctrine of equivalents was not addressed by the district_court although sandoz argues the issue` in an abundance of caution
``

the meaning and scope of` pharmaceutically acceptable_polymer' as used in these patents has been litigated in other_cases none of which had been finally decided but some of which had been appealed to the federal_circuit based on the grant of a preliminary_injunction
the district_court now construed` pharmaceutically acceptable_polymer' in accordance with the construction by the federal_circuit in andrx supra
sandoz argues on this appeal that the correct_construction is that of the federal_circuits earlier decision in teva supra
sandoz argues that because teva was the earlier ruling it could not be overturned by the later andrx_panel citing newell cos. inc. v. kenney_mfg co. 864_f.2d_757 765 fed.cir.1988` where there is a direct_conflict [ between federal_circuit panels ] the precedential_decision is the first
``

abbott responds that the decision in andrx was properly followed by this district_court for in teva the` construction' of` pharmaceutically acceptable_polymer' was not at issue and this courts comment thereon was dictum
the court in andrx recognized the non-binding nature of that comment in teva
indeed the district_court in teva had stated that` [ a ] t this early stage of the proceedings the parties have raised no issue as to claim_construction'
abbott_laboratories v. andrx_pharmaceuticals inc. no._0 5 c 1490 2005_wl_1323435 at *3 *4 n.d.ill
june_03,_2005 teva conceding literal_infringement but challenging validity

the panel in andrx decided the questions now raised by sandoz concerning the` construction' of` pharmaceutically acceptable_polymer' and the pharmacokinetic_requirements in the claims
the andrx_panel also explained its departure from the *1359 panel decision in teva
the district_court herein applying andrx held that a person of ordinary_skill in this field would interpret` pharmaceutically acceptable_polymer' in terms of the following description in the ¡¬718_specification' pharmaceutically acceptable' as used herein means those compounds which are within the scope of sound_medical_judgment suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower_animals without undue_toxicity irritation allergic_response and the like in keeping with a reasonable_benefit/risk_ratio and effective for their intended use in the chemotherapy and prophylaxis of antimicrobial_infections
¡¬718_patent col. 3_lines_40 -47
the district_court referred to the ¡¬718_specifications listing of pharmaceutically acceptable_polymers but applied the andrx ruling that the polymers are not limited to those that are named in the following paragraph the pharmaceutically acceptable_polymer is a water-soluble hydrophilic_polymer selected from the group consisting of polyvinylpyrrolidine hydroxypropyl_cellulose hydroxypropyl methyl_cellulose methyl_cellulose vinyl acetate/crotonic acid_copolymers methacrylic_acid_copolymers maleic_anhydride/methyl_vinyl_ether_copolymers and derivatives and mixtures thereof
'718_patent col. 3_line_65 to col. 4_line_4
the district_court construed` pharmaceutically acceptable_polymer' as [ a ] ny polymer which within the scope of sound_medical_judgment is suitable for use in pharmaceutical_compositions for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower_animals without undue_toxicity irritation allergic_response and the like in keeping with a reasonable_benefit/risk_ratio and effective for their intended use in the chemotherapy and prophylaxis of antimicrobial_infections and is capable of forming a matrix to extend drug_release into the bloodstream
such a` pharmaceutically acceptable_polymer' must constitute 5_to_50 % by weight of the product
abbott 500 f.supp.2d at 834
the district_court following andrx held that the usage` from the group consisting of' in the specification is not exclusive as it would be in a markush-form claim and did not negate the broader description that is also contained in the specification as quoted above

this aspect was debated in the district_court and again on this appeal
sandoz argues that since` pharmaceutically acceptable_polymer' is limited by the specification to water-soluble hydrophilic_polymers and that since the listed methacrylic_acid_copolymers are known to include water-insoluble as well as water-soluble polymers the term` pharmaceutically acceptable_polymer' must be construed to mean that the formulation can not include any water-insoluble methacrylic acid or other polymer
the district_court receiving this argument reasoned that` the existence of water-insoluble polymers from the specifically-mentioned methacrylic acid co-polymer subset actually militates towards a broader construction urged by abbott that would encompass water-insoluble methacrylic acid co-polymers'
abbott 500 f.supp.2d at 834
sandoz argues that this reasoning is flawed and that this court in andrx erred in rejecting this argument
however we are not persuaded that the andrx_panels ruling warrants rejection on this argument for we agree with the district_court that the fact that some methacrylic_acid_copolymers are water-insoluble does not require limiting` pharmaceutically acceptable_polymer' to the named polymers

we conclude that the district_courts claim_construction which is that of andrx is correct and that the district_court properly *1360 declined to follow teva
sandoz argument that teva was the correct_construction and should be revived by the federal_circuit is hard to square with sandoz statement to the district_court that` a very important point to make here is sandoz does not rely on the federal_circuit opinion in the teva case.. sandoz agrees with abbott'
statement at the february 12 2007 preliminary_injunction hearing transcript at a11085

sandoz further argues that the district_court erred by using the word` matrix' in its definition of` pharmaceutically acceptable_polymer' quoted above pointing out that this word does not appear in the claims or specification
however claim_construction often calls upon words other than those of the patent lest the claim simply define itself
`` claim construction' is for the purpose of explaining and defining terms in the claims and usually requires use of words other than the words that are being defined
see multiform desiccants inc. v. medzam ltd. 133_f.3d_1473 1477 fed.cir.1998 claims are construed as an aid to the decision-maker by restating the claims in non-technical terms

abbotts expert_dr._davis had used the word` matrix' in his explanation of the technology of extended_release
he explained that a` pharmaceutically acceptable_polymer.. alone or in combination with other_polymers is capable of forming a matrix when mixed with the drug to control and extend drug_release into the gi_tract and thence to the bloodstream'
declaration of professor davis january 10 2007
sandoz does not dispute that this explanation comports with the description in the specification
also abbott cites several scientific publications that use the word` matrix' in this context and sandoz does not argue that the word has a different meaning from that with which it was used by the district_court
there is no ground for discarding the district_courts claim_construction based on the word` matrix'

sandoz also argued that the claims must be construed so that the` pharmaceutically acceptable_polymer' is the only release_agent in the composition argued that the presence of any other agent that affects release of the drug removes the composition from the scope of the ¡¬718_claims
abbott pointed out that the claims use the conventional signal` comprising' which means that other ingredients may be present in the composition in addition to those explicitly set forth
see cias inc. v. alliance gaming corp. 504_f.3d_1356 1360 fed.cir.2007` in the patent_claim context the termcomprising is well understood to meanincluding but not limited to
`` ; georgia-pacific corp. v. united_states gypsum co. 195_f.3d_1322 1327-28 fed.cir.1999`comprising.. is inclusive or open-ended and does not exclude additional unrecited elements or method steps'

sandoz argues that the district_courts claim_construction is incorrect because it ignores the distinction between` pharmaceutically acceptable_polymers' and` pharmaceutically acceptable_excipients'
we discern no support for this challenge
abbott points out that the distinction between` polymer' and` excipient' lies in its role in the composition as the patent states` the compositions of the invention further comprise pharmaceutically acceptable_excipients and/or fillers and extenders such as lactose..'
¡¬718_patent col. 4 lines 21-23
we discern no flawed judicial understanding of the term` excipient'

sandoz also argued that the components of its accused formulation are merely` excipients' in that they do not extend the release of the clarithromycin while abbott pointed out that sandoz described its product to the fda as` extended_release'
*1361 sandoz stated that the extension of release for its product is achieved not by the polymer that is present in its composition but by other_components
the district_court considered the arguments concerning the role of the maltodextrin and the silicified_microcrystalline_cellulose in the sandoz_product
the court discussed the evidence of release rates and amounts released including the information in sandoz approved anda the comparative data presented by both sides and various technical articles provided by both sides on the physical and chemical characteristics of the components of the sandoz_formulation
the court found that` abbott has demonstrated a substantial_likelihood that maltodextrin is a polymer that alone or in combination with other_polymers is capable of forming a matrix to extend drug_release'
abbott 500 f.supp.2d at 837

sandoz argues that the district_court erred in its evaluation of the evidence stating that abbott did not show by direct testing that any of the polymers in the sandoz_product actually extends the release of clarithromycin
sandoz argues that the district_court erred in finding unpersuasive certain laboratory tests conducted by sandoz to show that maltodextrin has no significant impact on the dissolution rate of clarithromycin
abbott responds that the district_court did not err and that sandoz must be deemed to have admitted that maltodextrin and silicified_microcrystalline_cellulose are polymers that alone or in combination with other_components are capable of extending drug_release
abbott pointed out to the district_court that the developer of the sandoz_formulation dr. nirmal mulye in his patent_application u.s.2004/0224017 a1 entitled` process for preparing sustained release tablets' stated that` the present inventor has found that the addition of maltodextrin in effective_amounts provides the desired release profile' that` maltodextrin also tends to slow down the release of a medicament in a controlled release_formulation [ ]' and that` the maltodextrin used in the present invention is to counteract the accelerated rate of release of the drug..' we have not been directed to clear_error in the district_courts findings on this question

sandoz raises additional arguments some discussed by the district_court and some newly presented on this appeal
all have been considered
we conclude that the district_courts findings and rulings at this stage of the proceedings have not been shown to constitute reversible_error
the ruling that abbott had shown a reasonable_likelihood of proving infringement is sustained

iv
the equitable factors
sandoz states that the district_court incorrectly resolved and weighed the equitable_factors relevant to the grant of a preliminary_injunction
sandoz states that the factors of irreparable_harm the balance of harms and the public_interest all weigh in its favor and outweigh any finding that abbott is likely to prevail on the issues of validity or enforceability and infringement
the district_court considered these factors and explained its reasoning in exercising its discretion to grant the preliminary_injunction

irreparable harm
sandoz argued that any harm to abbott is not irreparable for damages are available for infringement if the eventual final judgment is adverse to sandoz
sandoz pointed out that the generic producers teva and ranbaxy are already in this market by settlement with abbott such that any price_erosion due to generic competition is already occurring
the district_court considered these relationships and *1362 concluded that they do not negate the market_share and revenue_loss upon sandoz entry while the litigation proceeds
precedent supports this conclusion
see e.g. purdue pharma l.p. v. boehringer ingelheim gmbh 237_f.3d_1359 1368 fed.cir.2001 likelihood of price_erosion and loss of market position are evidence of irreparable_harm ; bio-technology_gen._corp. v. genentech inc. 80_f.3d_1553 1566 fed.cir.1996 loss of revenue goodwill and research and development support constitute irreparable_harm ; polymer_technologies inc. v. bridwell 103_f.3d_970 975-76 fed.cir.1996 loss of market opportunities can not be quantified or adequately compensated and is evidence of irreparable_harm

the balance of hardships
the district_court discussed and weighed the hardships argued by both parties and found that the balance of hardships tipped in favor of abbott
the court found that preserving the status_quo preserves the current market structure recognizing that abbott has licensed other generic producers
the district_court concluded that` abbott will lose much more if this court did not enjoin sandozs infringing conduct than if the court enjoins sandoz and it is subsequently found that the ¡¬718_patent is invalid or unenforceable'
abbott 500 f.supp.2d at 845

we agree that the fact that a patentee has licensed others under its patents does not mean that unlicensed infringement must also be permitted while the patents are litigated
precedent illustrates that when the patentee is simply interested in obtaining licenses without itself engaging in commerce equity may add weight to permitting infringing activity to continue during litigation on the premise that the patentee is readily made whole if infringement is found
in this case the district_court received abbotts argument that it could not be made whole if it prevails in this litigation for the added erosion of markets customers and prices is rarely reversible
see sanofi-synthelabo 470 f.3d at 1383 rejecting hardship claim of generic challenger whose` harms were almost entirely preventable and were the result of its own calculated risk to launch its product prejudgment'

clear_error has not been shown in the district_courts finding that the harm to sandoz of delay in entering this market while this case is litigated is outweighed by the harm to abbott in view of the likelihood that abbott will succeed in sustaining the validity and enforceability of its patents

the public interest
sandoz argues that the public_interest favors the availability of less expensive forms of successful medicines
the district_court considered this argument and stated the court recognizes the public_interest in competition in the pharmaceutical market
it also recognizes however the public_interest in creating beneficial and useful products and the cost involved in that process
to the extent that this court has found a substantial_likelihood that the ¡¬718_patent is valid and enforceable there can be no serious argument that public_interest is not best served by enforcing it
500 f.supp.2d at 846
the district_court appreciated that the public_interest includes consideration of whether by shifting market benefits to the infringer while litigation is pending for patents that are likely to withstand the attack the incentive for discovery and development of new products is adversely affected
the statutory period of exclusivity reflects the congressional balance of interests and warrants weight in considering the public_interest
in sanofi-synthelabo 470 f.3d at 1383 this court referred to the significant *1363` public_interest in encouraging investment in drug development and protecting the exclusionary rights conveyed in valid pharmaceutical patents'
as the court explained in kewanee oil co. v. bicron corp. 416_u.s._470 94_s.ct._1879 40_l.ed.2d_315_(1974)` the patent laws promote this progress by offering a right of exclusion for a limited period as an incentive to inventors to risk the often enormous costs in terms of time research and development'
id.at 480 94_s.ct._1879

sandoz states that the courts recent decision in ebay_inc. v. mercexchange l.l.c. 547_u.s._388 126_s.ct._1837 164_l.ed.2d_641_(2006) negates any presumption of entitlement to an injunction upon a finding of likelihood that a patent will be sustained and found infringed
the district_court did not apply such a presumption but fully considered all of the legal and equitable_factors
at the preliminary_injunction_stage the legal and equitable_factors may be of different weight when the patentee is itself engaged in commerce as contrasted with a patentee that is seeking to license its patent to others
we need not resolve this aspect for all possible situations for as between abbott and sandoz the district_court objectively weighed the legal probabilities and the equities and exercised its discretionary judgment as to the entirety of the cause
we have been shown no basis for believing that the district_court abused its discretion

v. the injunction bond
sandoz also appeals the amount of the injunction bond which the district_court set at $ 40 million
sandoz provides no substance for appellate_review of the amount of the bond simply stating in its brief that it` presented [ to the district_court ] at least colorable evidence that its losses from the injunction and recall would be $ 200 million' but not describing the evidence or arguing its merits
sandoz simply states that its proposed number should have been accepted in the event that the $ 40 million is later shown to be inadequate

this aspect has not been presented in reviewable substance
on this appeal abuse of discretion has been shown in the district_courts setting of the terms of the injunction
see russell v. farley 105_u.s._433 441 26_l.ed._1060_(1881) the courts discretion in setting the terms of an injunction is rooted in equity

vi
the issue of conflicting precedent
the district_court found the likelihood that the patentee would succeed on the merits and that the equities favored the patentee and exercised its discretion to enjoin infringement during the litigation
the dissent states that the district_court applied the incorrect standard and that if the infringer` raises a substantial_question concerning either infringement or validity' diss
op.at 1371 it is an abuse of discretion to enjoin infringement pendente lite
the dissent quotes with approval a past panel statement that` in resisting a preliminary_injunction however one need not make out a case of actual validity
vulnerability is the issue at the preliminary_injunction_stages while validity is the issue at trial'
id
indeed this courts precedent makes this statement in direct_conflict with other earlier statements that the standard is not vulnerability but likelihood of success on the merits

in response to the arguments expounded in the dissenting opinion i summarize the law governing the grant of a preliminary_injunction
the criteria relied on in *1364 the dissent are not the criteria of any other circuit nor of the supreme_court
the correct standard is not whether a substantial_question has been raised but whether the patentee is likely to succeed on the merits upon application of the standards of proof that will prevail at trial
the question is not whether the patent is vulnerable ; the question is who is likely to prevail in the end considered with equitable_factors that relate to whether the status_quo should or should not be preserved while the trial is ongoing
the presentation of sufficient evidence to show the likelihood of prevailing on the merits is quite different from the presentation of substantial evidence to show vulnerability

thus the evidence that favors the patent must be considered in deciding a motion for a preliminary_injunction as well as the evidence against the patent
the trial_court then decides which side is likely ultimately to prevail
the dissent presents only the case against the patent apparently on the theory that this is all that is needed to raise a` substantial_question'

indeed a showing of a substantial_question concerning validity or infringement can serve to avert judgment on the pleadings or to avoid the grant of summary_judgment but it is not the same as showing likelihood of eventual_success on the merits
the dissent recognizes that it is not the same and that it` requires less_proof' but errs in stating that this is sufficient to defeat the grant of a preliminary_injunction
precedent is clear that the standard is the likelihood of success of the plaintiff at trial with recognition of the presumptions and burdens
see e.g. gillette co. v. energizer holdings inc. 405_f.3d_1367 1370 fed.cir.2005 ; ranbaxy pharmaceuticals. inc. v. apotex inc. 350_f.3d_1235 1239 fed.cir.2003 ; reebok int l ltd. v. j. baker inc. 32_f.3d_1552 1555 fed.cir.1994 ; smith int l inc. v. hughes tool co. 718_f.2d_1573 1579 fed.cir.1983

supreme_court_precedent every regional_circuit and controlling federal_circuit_precedent apply to the preliminary_injunction the combination of criteria that includes likelihood of success on the merits and equitable_considerations
no other court has held that when the attacker has presented a` substantial_question' on its side of the dispute-that is more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance of evidence in support of its side-no injunction_pendente_lite is available
further equitable_factors are of particular significance at the preliminary stage where the question is whether to change the position of the parties during the litigation
see camenisch 451 u.s. at 395 101_s.ct._1830 the preliminary_injunction preserves the position of the parties during the litigation
the dissent does not mention the equitable_factors that were considered by the district_court as required by precedent ; the dissent simply states that the injunction must be denied if the attacker has raised a substantial_question

supreme_court_precedent is clear in stating that the same burdens and standards of proof apply in deciding the merits for preliminary_injunction_purposes as in deciding the same questions upon full litigation
see e.g. gonzales 546 u.s. at 429 126_s.ct._1211 placing the burdens of proof for showing likelihood of success at the preliminary_injunction_stage
the court explained in amoco production co. v. village of gambell ak 480_u.s._531 546_n._2 107_s.ct._1396 94_l.ed.2d_542_(1987) that` the standard for a preliminary_injunction is essentially the same as for a permanent injunction with the exception that the plaintiff must show a likelihood of success on the merits rather than actual success'

*1365 there is no reason why patent_cases require unique treatment
see ebay_inc. v. mercexchange l.l.c. 547_u.s._388 126_s.ct._1837 164_l.ed.2d_641
394 2006` [ t ] he decision whether to grant or deny injunctive_relief_rests within the equitable_discretion of the district_courts and that such_discretion must be exercised consistent with traditional_principles of equity in patent disputes no less than in other_cases governed by such_standards`
the general criterion of likelihood of success on the merits in the context of the equities of the particular case are uniform throughout the regional_circuits
all are consistent with the rulings of the supreme_court and although the words vary all refer to the likelihood of the eventual outcome not whether a substantial_question has been raised
in brief sampling starting with the first circuit the court summarized the standard in wine and spirits retailers inc. v. rhode island 418_f.3d_36_(1st_cir.2005) the sine qua non of this four-part_inquiry is likelihood of success on the merits if the moving party can not demonstrate that he is likely to succeed in his quest the remaining factors become matter of idle curiosity
id.at 46 citation omitted
the referenced` four-part_inquiry' is` 1 the likelihood of success on the merits ; 2 the potential for irreparable_harm [ to the movant ] if the injunction is denied ; 3 the balance of relevant impositions i.e. the hardship to the nonmovant if enjoined as contrasted with the hardship to the movant if no injunction_issues ; and 4 the effect if any of the courts ruling on the public_interest'

the third_circuit also stated that the district_court must consider four factors` [ a ] the likelihood that the applicant will prevail on the merits at final_hearing ; [ b ] the extent to which the plaintiffs are being irreparably harmed by the conduct complained of ; [ c ] the extent to which the defendants will suffer irreparable_harm if the preliminary_injunction is issued ; and [ d ] the public_interest'

in eli_lilly & co. v. premo pharmaceutical laboratories inc. 630_f.2d_120_(3rd_cir.1980) the court explained that when analyzing a preliminary_injunction the moving party must generally show 1 a reasonable_probability of eventual_success in the litigation and 2 that the movant will be irreparably injured pendente lite if relief is not granted..
moreover while the burden rests upon the moving party to make these two requisite showings the district_court` should take into account when they are relevant 3 the possibility of harm to other interested persons from the grant or denial of the injunction and 4 the public_interest'
...
while these factors structure the inquiry however no one aspect will necessarily determine its outcome
rather proper judgment entails adelicate_balancing of all elements
on the basis of the data before it the district_court must attempt to minimize the probable harm to legally protected interests between the time that the motion for a preliminary_injunction *1366 is filed and the time of the final_hearing

summary
to summarize my concern for the conflict that is here continued i again point out that the dissenting opinion despite its initial recitation of the correct four-part criteria for deciding the grant or denial of *1369 a preliminary_injunction then applies the different and incorrect criterion of whether the defendant raised a` substantial_question' that may render the patent` vulnerable'
that standard conflicts with precedent of the supreme_court and all of the regional_circuits all of which require that likelihood of success on the merits be determined and weighed along with the equitable_factors
it is not the law that raising a` substantial_question' will` negate the patentees likelihood of success'
diss
op.at 1372
raising a substantial_question may avoid dismissal on the pleadings but contrary to the view of the dissent establishing that there is an issue for trial is not the same as establishing the likelihood of prevailing at trial

the district_court analyzed the positions of both sides as well as the equitable_factors decided that abbott was likely to prevail on the merits and that the equitable_factors weighed in favor of abbott and exercised its discretion to grant the preliminary_injunction
the dissent states that a showing of` vulnerability' shows that the defendant is likely to prevail on the merits ; that is facially incorrect
the dissent also relies on some recent 2008 federal_circuit decisions ; these decisions are not` clearly established precedent' for they can not overcome earlier rulings of this court
further until today no opinion has equated the raising of a` substantial_question' with a showing of likelihood of success on the merits

i respectfully dissent from the courts opinion
there is no legal basis for the granting of a preliminary_injunction and its issuance is an abuse of discretion
although generally the denial or issuance of a preliminary_injunction is within the broad discretion of the district_court the decision of the district_court must be reversed when it abuses its discretion
see_cybor_corp. v. fas_technologies inc. 138_f.3d_1448 1460 fed.cir.1998 en banc` a district_court abuses its discretion when its decision is based on clearly erroneous_findings of fact is based on erroneous_interpretations of the law or is clearly unreasonable arbitrary or fanciful

when the district_court considers the four factors` the likelihood of success_factor plays a key role' id. and that is the factor i will focus on in my dissent
because of` the extraordinary nature of the relief the patentee carries the burden of showing likelihood of success on the merits' in light of the presumptions and burdens that will inhere at trial with respect to the patents validity enforceability and infringement

amazon.com 239 f.3d at 1350-51
this court has explained that in resisting a preliminary_injunction however one need not make out a case *1372 of actual invalidity
vulnerability is the issue at the preliminary_injunction_stages while validity is the issue at trial
the showing of a substantial_question as to invalidity thus requires less_proof than the clear and convincing showing necessary to establish invalidity itself

v. andrx pharms. inc. 452_f.3d_1331 1335 fed.cir.2006 herein` andrx' quoting amazon.com 239 f.3d at 1359

the majority_opinion postulates that the findings of the district_court are correct
it is error to so conclude because the district_court failed to properly consider and weigh the ample evidence produced by sandoz that clearly established a substantial_question of invalidity and rendered the patent vulnerable to an invalidity challenge at trial
instead the district_court erroneously required proof of clear and convincing_evidence of invalidity at the preliminary stages of the proceedings
as i explain below this conflicts with our clearly established precedent

under our precedent the likelihood of success_factor is properly analyzed by considering whether the alleged_infringer raises a substantial_question as to validity
see e.g. e.i
du pont de nemours & co. v. macdermid printing solutions l.l.c. 525_f.3d_1353 1358 fed.cir.2008` [ i ] f the accused infringer raises a substantial_question regarding validity the district_court should find that the patentee has not shown a likelihood of success on the merits'
( internal_quotation_marks omitted
indeed this court has consistently held that an alleged_infringer can negate the patentees likelihood of success on the merits-and thus defeat a preliminary_injunction-by raising a substantial_question as to validity
for example in genentech this court explained in order to demonstrate that it has a likelihood of success [ the patentee ] must show that in light of the presumptions and burdens that will inhere at trial on the merits 1 it will likely prove that [ the alleged_infringer ] infringes the [ ] patent and 2 its infringement claim will likely withstand [ the alleged_infringers ] challenges to the validity and enforceability of the [ ] patent
in other_words if [ the alleged_infringer ] raises a` substantial_question' concerning validity enforceability or infringement i.e. asserts a defense that [ the patentee ] can not show` lacks substantial_merit' the preliminary_injunction should not issue
more specifically with regard to [ the alleged_infringers ] validity defenses the question on appeal is whether there is substantial_merit to [ the alleged_infringers ] assertion that the [ ] patent_claim [ is invalid ]
genentech inc. v. novo nordisk a/s 108_f.3d_1361 1364 fed.cir.1997
our subsequent cases consistently applied the law as it was explained in genentech
see e.g. tate access floors v. interface architectural res. 279_f.3d_1357 1365 fed.cir.2002` in order to demonstrate likely success on the merits [ the patentee ] must show that in light of the presumptions and burdens applicable at trial it will likely prove that [ the alleged_infringer ] infringes the asserted claims of the [ ] patent and that the patent will likely withstand [ the alleged_infringers ] challenges to its validity
if [ the alleged_infringer ] raises a substantial_question concerning infringement or validity meaning that it asserts a defense that [ the patentee ] can not provelacks substantial_merit the preliminary_injunction issued improperly'
( internal citations omitted ; citing genentech 108 f.3d at 1364 and amazon.com 239 f.3d at 1350-51

our most recent cases continue to adhere to the law as it was explained in genentech
see e.g. *1373 erico int l corp. v. vutec corp. 516_f.3d_1350 1352 1354 fed.cir.2008 stating that` [ the alleged_infringer ] must show a substantial_question of invalidity to avoid a showing of likelihood of success' and vacating the preliminary_injunction` [ b ] ecause this court finds that [ the alleged_infringer ] has raised a substantial_question as to the validity of the patent at issue' ; phg techs. llc v. st. john cos. 469_f.3d_1361 1365 1369 fed.cir.2006 explaining that` in order to defeat the injunction on grounds of potential invalidity [ the alleged_infringer ] as the party bearing the burden of proof on the issue at trial must establish a substantial_question of invalidity' and holding the district_court clearly erred in finding the patentee was likely to succeed` because [ the alleged_infringer ] has satisfied its burden of raising a substantial_question of invalidity'
thus under our clearly established precedent when the alleged_infringer raises a substantial_question regarding validity a preliminary_injunction can not issue because the patentee has failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits

while section_vi of the opinion contains a superfluity of citations it does not state the law relevant to this case
it is a pleasant ambulatory and meandering discussion ; but it is not required to decide this case is not part of the majority_opinion and is clearly dicta
although section_vi discusses the relevant four-factor_test and properly emphasizes the likelihood of success_factor it ignores the way this court has consistently analyzed whether or not a patentee has demonstrated it will likely succeed at trial
the real question before us in this case as our precedent clearly explains is whether the district_court erred in finding that sandoz had not established a substantial_question as to the obviousness of the ¡¬718_patent
see e.g. genentech 108 f.3d at 1364` [ t ] he question on appeal is whether there is substantial_merit to [ the alleged_infringers ] assertion that the [ ] patent_claim [ is invalid ]`
sandoz has in fact raised and substantially established that the validity of the ¡¬718_patent is vulnerable and on the record before us abbott failed to prove the invalidity_defense` lacks substantial_merit'
see amazon.com 239 f.3d at 1350-51` if [ the alleged_infringer ] raises a substantial_question concerning either infringement or validity i.e. asserts an infringement or invalidity_defense that the patentee can not provelacks substantial_merit the preliminary_injunction should not issue`
thus the district_court committed reversible_error when it analyzed the likelihood of success_factor and determined that abbott had established it would likely succeed on the merits
in light of that error i would vacate the preliminary_injunction and remand for reconsideration and reweighing of the injunctive factors
moreover various additional legal_errors taint the district_courts decision

i
the district_courts grant of a preliminary_injunction rested on only two claims claims 1_and_4 of the ¡¬718_patent
claim 1 reads a pharmaceutical_composition for extended_release of an erythromycin_derivative in the gastrointestinal_environment comprising
an erythromycin_derivative and
from about 5 [ % ] to about 50 % by weight of a pharmaceutically acceptable_polymer1 so that when ingested orally *1374 the composition induces statistically significantly lower_mean_fluctuation_index [ dfl ] in the plasma than an immediate_release_composition of the erythromycin_derivative while maintaining bioavailability substantially equivalent to that of the immediate_release_composition of the erythromycin_derivative

¡¬718_patent col.11 ll.28-38
claim 4 similarly claims an erythromycin_derivative and` from about 5 [ % ] to about 50 % by weight of a pharmaceutically acceptable_polymer' but has different pk_parameters
id
col. 11 ll.48-58
claim 2 and claim 3 are dependant claims of claim 1
claim 2 claims` the pharmaceutical_composition of claim 1 wherein the polymer is a hydrophilic water-soluble polymer'
id
col.11 ll.39-40
claim 3 claims` the pharmaceutical_composition of claim 2 wherein the polymer is selected from the group consisting of polyvinylpyrrolidine hydroxypropyl_cellulose hydroxypropylmethyl_cellulose methyl_cellulose vinyl acetate/crotonic acid_copolymers methacrylic_acid_copolymers maleic_anhydride/methyl_vinyl_ether_copolymers and derivatives and mixtures thereof'
id
col. 11 ll.41-47

claims 1_and_4 of the ¡¬718_patent have three basic limitations a an erythromycin_derivative ; b 5 % to 50 % by weight of a pharmaceutically acceptable_polymer ; and c various pk_parameters
in the preferred_embodiment the erythromycin_derivative is clarithromycin and the pharmaceutically acceptable_polymer is hpmc at 10 % to 30 % by weight of the composition
claim 4 requires pk_parameters be such that` upon oral_ingestion maximum_peak_concentrations of the erythromycin_derivative are lower than those produced by an immediate_release_pharmaceutical_composition and [ auc ] and the minimum plasma concentration are substantially equivalent to that of the immediate_release_pharmaceutical_composition'
id
col.11 ll.52-58
claim 1 achieves similar results with slightly different parameters
for claim 1 the composition must have a` statistically significantly lower_mean_fluctuation_index' dfl which is defined in the specification as dfl = cmax ?
cmin / cav id
col.3 ll.29-30 and substantially equivalent_bioavailability which the district_court found meant that the` [ er ] auc values must be between 80 % to 125 % within a 90 % confidence level as compared to the immediate_release_composition auc values

v. sandoz inc. 500_f.supp.2d_807 831 n.d.ill.2007 herein` sandoz_i`

ii
sandoz based its obviousness arguments primarily on three prior_art_references which it argues combined with common_sense and the ordinary_skill of the art at the time make the ¡¬718_patent anticipated or obvious
first sandoz argues that the ptc application wo 95/30422` the ¡¬422_publication' filed by pfizer discloses a controlled release dosage_form of azithromycin which like clarithromycin is an erythromycin_derivative.3 according to the disclosure these controlled released compositions operate to release the drug substantially slower than the immediate_release *1375 versions to reduce gi side effects
and as sandoz points out the controlled release_compositions disclosed in the ¡¬422_publication include a hydrophilic_polymer composition of azithromycin with a preferred_embodiment being a matrix tablet containing 15 % to 35 % hpmc
second sandoz noted that the ¡¬190_patent owned by abbott discloses and claims controlled release_compositions of clarithromycin in an non-polymer alginate matrix which are administered once a day and have slowed absorption such that they are bioequivalent with the current immediate_release twice-a-day compositions and maintain therapeutic levels at 24 hours after ingestion
claim 14 of the ¡¬190_patent also claims other marolides including azithromycin.4 third sandoz argues that the ¡¬571_publication filed by eli_lilly discloses sustained release_formulations for antimicrobial agents including clarithromycin which contain an active agent namely a hydrophilic_polymer such as hpmc and an acrylic_polymer
according to the specification these formulations differ from the prior_art that uses just hydrophilic_polymers in that they are designed to allow a constant rate of release throughout the gi_tract
in particular the ¡¬571_publication disclosed using from about 5 % to about 29 % by weight hydrophilic_polymer and about 0.5 % to about 25 % by weight acrylic_polymer with the total weight of the two polymers not exceeding 30 % by weight

in addition to challenging the validity of the ¡¬718_patent based on the ¡¬190_patent the ¡¬422_publication and the ¡¬571_publication sandoz also relies on various evidence that the pk_parameters specified in the ¡¬718_patent were well known in the art and would have been sought by anyone designing a controlled release_formulation
most strikingly the testimony of one of the inventors named on the ¡¬718_patent linda_gustavson an abbott employee supports the sandoz position
in particular gustavson testified as follows q did you tell [ the formulations department ] what pharmacokinetic_parameters there should be ?
a i mean not specific numbers but relative to the ir yes
i told at least sue that what we needed was *1376 a lower_cmax an auc that met fda requirements for bioequivalence and a cmin that was at least comparable to the ir
q and where did you get these parameters ?
... a a few years of experience i guess
theyre the-i mean certainly the cmax and auc are very basic pk_parameters determined in virtually every study that has pharmacokinetics
cmin [ ] might or might not be important depending upon the drug you were talking about and what part of the pharmacokinetics you though might be associated with efficacy or safety
for clarithromycin there was some thought that keeping the concentrations above some minimum level might be at least in part important to maintaining effectiveness efficacy
q would you say that these pk_parameters were pretty much known in the art ?
a absolutely yes

furthermore sandoz submitted references from 1983 over a decade before the ¡¬ 718 application was submitted which explained inter alia that the` objectives and possible advantages of controlled release dosage' forms included` maintain [ ing ] therapeutic drug_levels'` reduc [ ing ] dosing frequency'` reduc [ ing ] fluctuations in drug_levels' and` reduc [ ing ] side effects'
and the reference explained that the` essence of controlled drug_release' was to` obtain prolonged circulating drug_levels with less fluctuation compared to conventional dosage_forms and to achieve these with less frequent drug administration'
they also submitted references showing that hpmc was considered the` controlled release_agent of choice' in the field

the district_court writing prior to ksr found that despite this courts decision in andrx to the contrary claims 1_and_4 of the ¡¬718_patent were not obvious at least based on the preliminary record
the trial_courts finding rested on the fact that contrary to this courts conclusion in andrx new_evidence established that the ¡¬190_patent the ¡¬571_publication and the wo_¡¬422_publication did not disclose the specific pk_limitations of the ¡¬718_patent
the court recognized that` [ g ] enerally a showing that there is an established structural relationship between a prior_art composition and the claimed composition demonstrates a prima_facie_case of obviousness'
sandoz_i 500 f.supp.2d at 840
see in re dillon 919_f.2d_688 692 fed.cir.1990 en banc` [ s ] tructural similarity between claimed and prior_art_subject_matter proved by combining references or otherwise where the prior_art gives reason or motivation to make the claimed compositions creates a prima_facie_case of obviousness`
still the court concluded that abbott had preliminarily rebutted this showing by showing the specific pk properties embodied in the claims were unobvious
the trial_court found that` [ t ] o succeed on its obvious [ ness ] claim sandoz must produce evidence indicating that the pk_limitations were disclosed in the prior_art or were at the very least inherent to the structural_limitations of the prior_art_compositions'
sandoz_i 500 f.supp.2d at 840
sandoz the court found had not done so
id
moreover the trial_court found that` because the ¡¬190 prior_art does not disclose the [ specific ] pk_profile of the ¡¬718_patent a person skilled in the art would not be motivated to look at the wo_¡¬422_publication and interchange clarithromycin for azithromycin'
id.at 841

subsequently the district_court denied sandozs motion for a stay of the preliminary_injunction pending appellate_review in light of the just issued ksr_opinion
the court held that under ksr it was still *1377 necessary to` demonstrate the presence of all claim_limitations in the prior_art' and that sandoz had not produced evidence indicating that the pk_limitations were disclosed in the prior_art or inherent to the structural_limitations of the prior_art_compositions
abbott_labs
v. sandoz 500_f.supp.2d_846 851-53 n.d.ill.2007
according to the district_court it thus had not and did not need to reach the tsm_test or any change in the application of this test brought on by ksr
id.at 853

on appeal there is no real dispute that the ¡¬571_publication expressly discloses a` sustained_release_matrix_formulation in tablet form comprising.. erythromycin' and containing from about 5 % by weight to about 29 % by weight of a hydrophilic_polymer thus meeting all of the structural_limitations of the ¡¬ 718 claims
moreover the prior_art clearly disclosed sustained release versions of clarithromycin and creating extended_release_formulations of erythromycin_derivatives using polymers preferably hpmc
and evidence shows that the desirability of the pk_parameters claimed were well known in the art

in light of this evidence sandoz raised a substantial_question as to the obviousness of the ¡¬718_patent
the district_courts decision to the contrary constituted an abuse of discretion
first it was clearly error to find as a matter of law that since none of the prior_art_references cited by sandoz explicitly disclosed a composition that had the pk_limitations of the ¡¬ 718 patent it had failed to demonstrate` the presence of all claim_limitations in the prior_art' and therefore that the ¡¬718 invention could not be obvious
contrary to the majority this holding relies on an improperly limited view of what types of references can be combined to show obviousness and an impermissibly cramped view of the supreme_courts holding in ksr
there is no absolute requirement that each claim_limitation be disclosed in a prior_art reference
see e.g. takeda chem
indus
v. alphapharm pty. ltd. 492_f.3d_1350 1356 fed.cir.2007` we have held that structural similarity between claimed and prior_art_subject_matter proved by combining references or otherwise where the prior_art gives reason or motivation to make the claimed compositions creates a prima_facie_case of obviousness'
( emphasis added ; tegal corp. v. tokyo electron am. inc. 257_f.3d_1331 1349 fed.cir.2001 acknowledging that a claim could be obvious over a single_prior_art_reference that does not disclose one of the limitations in the claim
rather in all cases the touchstone of the analysis is whether the` differences between the subject_matter sought to be patented and the prior_art are such that the subject_matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary_skill in the art to which said subject_matter pertains'
35 u.s.c.¡± 103 ; ksr int l co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 127_s.ct._1727 1734 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007) ; see also takeda 492 f.3d at 1357 explaining that` in cases involving new chemical compounds' to show a prima_facie_case of obviousness one must` identify some reason that would have led a chemist to modify a known compound in a particular manner' emphasis added
thus a given claim_limitation may be obvious over the prior_art even if no single reference had specifically disclosed that limitation
moreover even assuming an absolute rule that to be obvious a claim must be a combination of elements disclosed in the prior_art that standard was met here
as the supreme_court reiterated in ksr` inventions in most if not all instances rely upon building blocks long since uncovered and claimed discoveries almost of necessity will be combinations of what in some sense is already known'
127 s.ct.at 1741
in other_words it is the rare invention that is not a *1378 combination of prior_art elements.5 and this is not one of such rare cases
whether or not the prior_art disclosed compounds displaying the particular pk_parameters in the ¡¬ 718 patent sandoz did provide evidence suggesting that the pk_parameters disclosed in the ¡¬718_patent were absolutely known in the art and that the prior_art established that they were desirable in an extended_release_formula and indeed that at least the auc equivalence and lower_cmax were most likely essential to an extended_release_formula at least one that would be approved by the fda
this is sufficient to show that the claims might be a combination of elements previously known in the art
the prior_art on record disclosing the pk_limitations is of course further removed from the invention than for example a patent that disclosed a related drug formulation with the same pk_limitations as the ¡¬718_patent
but while this may well make the former less likely than the latter to make the ¡¬718_patent_claims obvious there is nothing as a matter of law that prevents the invention from being considered an obvious combination of the prior_art teachings contained in the current preliminary record
cf
aventis pharma deutschland gmbh v. lupin ltd. 499_f.3d_1293 1301 fed.cir.2007 explaining that while it is necessary for there to be` some articulated reasoning with some rational underpinning to support the legal conclusion of obviousness.. such reasoning need not seek out precise teachings directed to the specific subject_matter of the challenged claim' internal_quotation_marks omitted6

second it is not dispositive that abbott was not absolutely certain that using the formulations disclosed in the ¡¬422_patent would create a formulation with the desired pk_parameters
even before ksr this courts` case law [ was ] clear that obviousness can not be avoided simply by a showing of some degree of unpredictability in the art so long as there was a reasonable_probability of success'
pfizer 480 f.3d at 1364
and as the supreme_court stated in ksr` [ w ] hen there is a design_need or market_pressure to solve a problem and there are a finite_number of identified predictable_solutions a person of ordinary_skill has good_reason to pursue the known options within his or her technical_grasp
if this leads to the anticipated success it is likely the product not of innovation but of ordinary_skill and common_sense'
127 s.ct.at 1742` one of the ways in which a patents subject_matter can be proved obvious is by noting that there existed at the time of invention a known problem for which there was an obvious solution encompassed by the patent_claims
``

*1379 third the long standing precedent of this court and our predecessor recently highlighted and relied upon in pfizer is that` discovery of an optimum value of a variable' in a known process or composition is` usually obvious'
480 f.3d at 1368 citing in re peterson 315_f.3d_1325 1330 fed.cir.2003 ; in re boesch 617_f.2d_272 276 ccpa 1980 ; in re aller 42_c.c.p.a._824 220_f.2d_454 456 1955
accordingly in pfizer for example the court found that the optimization of a pharmaceutical compound to determine which acid salt was best was obvious where` the prior_art heavily suggests the particular anion used to form the salt'

similarly here if the pk_parameters claimed were well known and only routine_experimentation by someone skilled in the art would have been necessary in light of the hpmc formulations disclosed by the ¡¬422_publication and ¡¬571_publication to create an er_clarithromycin-hpmc formulation with the claimed pk_parameters this would be sufficient to create a prima_facie_case of obviousness

accordingly the district_court erred in concluding that the fact that the ¡¬ 422 publication and ¡¬190_patent did not disclose the pk_limitations of the asserted claims precluded a finding of obviousness
this legal_error constitutes an abuse of discretion
and contrary to the holding of the district_court sandoz has raised a` substantial_question concerning' the obviousness of the asserted claims
on this basis i would reverse the decision of the district_court

iii
sandoz also argues that several acts by abbott during the prosecution of its patent_application constitute inequitable_conduct and thus show that the district_court abused its discretion in not rejecting the motion for a preliminary_injunction based on the likelihood that the patents would be declared unenforceable

the patent examiner initially rejected the claims of the ¡¬718_application and requested that abbott show that one of its prior_art_compositions of clarithromycin which was described as an immediate_release pediatric suspension formula did not have the same extended_release properties as abbotts claimed invention
in response abbott submitted a declaration by linda_gustavson stating that the cmax of the er_clarithromycin` is statistically significantly lower than that for ir_formulation given twice daily'
j.a
10015
abbott now admits that this statement was incorrect-that the data gustavson relied on did not show a statistically significant_lowering of the cmax-but only a non-statistically significant apparent lowering and gustavson herself admits that she never performed any statistical_analysis of the data and would not have known how to do it

the district_court found that the concededly false statement was immaterial since all the examiner asked was whether the two products have the same_pk_properties
according to the district_court` [ g ] iven the accuracy of the ultimate conclusion-that the extended_release_formulation was indeed different from the immediate_release_suspension_formulation gustavsons declaration of astatistically significantly lower cmax is immaterial despite the fact that it satisfies the definition ofmaterial provided by 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 b'
sandoz_i 500 f.supp.2d at 822
the district_court reasoned that despite meeting the standard for materiality of ¡± 1.56 b a reasonable_examiner would not have considered the statement important
moreover the district_court emphasized that no claim of the ¡¬718_patent requires the extended_release_formulation to have a statistically significant_lower_cmax than the immediate_release_formulation

*1380 the gustavson_statement was material or more to the point there is substantial_likelihood that sandoz would be able to so establish at the merits stage
first contrary to the erroneous conclusion of the district_court we have held that` all misstatements or admissions that satisfy [ 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 b ] are considered material'
monsanto_co. v. bayer bioscience n.v. 514_f.3d_1229 1237_n._11_(fed.cir.2008)
in addition while no claim_element in the ¡¬718_patent specifically states that the cmax_value must be statistically significantly lower it does require cmax_values that are` lower' than in the immediate_release_formulation
despite the fact that in other claim_elements abbott uses the term` statistically significantly lower' it is far from clear that one can establish that the cmax_value is lower if the data does not show a statistically significant difference which by definition as ordinarily understood means that the data can not conclusively establish that there is a real difference
this court previously recognized that` there is little in the [ ¡¬718 ] patent itself that establishes the differences if any between parameters that are simplylower rather thanstatistically significantly lower
`` andrx 452 f.3d at 1339_n._4
moreover regardless of the claim_construction it would be important if not dispositive to a reasonable_examiner to know that abbott did not have data which showed a lower_cmax to any statistical_significance over the structurally similar prior_art suspension formulas in deciding whether to allow the claim over this prior_art

on this basis alone the district_court abused its discretion because it created such a high bar for materiality that in essence no statement or withholding of information would be material if it would not change the ultimate outcome of allowing the patent
this is inconsistent with our precedent
see e.g. hoffmann-la roche inc. v. promega corp. 323_f.3d_1354 1368 fed.cir.2003` the fact that the examiner did not have to rely on the purity representations in issuing the patent is not inconsistent with a finding of materiality
although the inventors statements regarding purity were not the principal focus of the office action response they were clearly an important aspect of it
under the circumstances a reasonable_examiner would have wanted to know that the patentability argument based on purity was unsupported by the experimental results cited by the inventors'
( internal citation omitted ; merck & co. v. danbury pharmacal inc. 873_f.2d_1418 1421 fed.cir.1989 rejecting a` but for' standard of materiality

in addition while the district_court did not reach the issue of intent the fact that gustavson submitted a declaration to the pto in which she claimed to have found a statistically significant_lowering of cmax despite now admitting to never having done any statistical_analysis is sufficient circumstantial_evidence of intent to raise a substantial_question of inequitable_conduct if not necessarily to prove inequitable_conduct on the merits

the district_court also found that the failure by abbott to disclose a new study7 *1381 was immaterial because abbott simply` chose to rely on the results of several other studies that showed differing mean_dfl_values' and the totality of the evidence demonstrates that the prior_art formulation did not have the` same broad pk properties as those claimed for the er_formulation'
sandoz_i 500 f.supp.2d at 824
the test is not whether the examiner would have refused to allow the patent to issue without the information but just whether it would have been` important' to her consideration
here the extent the pk_parameters of the er_formulation differed from the clarithromycin_formulations in the prior_art was the primary focus of the examiners concerns regarding patentability and abbotts ability to establish sufficient differences was the basis for allowing the claims
it was not for abbott to decide unilaterally that it preferred the results of one set of studies that supported patentability and therefore could ignore studies reaching the opposite result
cf
paragon podiatry lab
v. klm labs. 984_f.2d_1182 1193 fed.cir.1993 finding inequitable_conduct for failure to disclose sales data and noting that` where the decision of whether or not to disclose sales before the critical date is close the case should be resolved by disclosure not by the applicants unilateral decision
``

accordingly i would also vacate the preliminary_injunction based on the allegations of inequitable_conduct
the evidence raises a substantial_question of unenforceability that makes the patents vulnerable to being found unenforceable at trial
thus the district_court erred when it concluded that abbott had shown it would likely succeed on the merits

because of the reasons stated above i would reverse the district_court on the basis that there are substantial_questions of both validity and enforceability of the ¡¬718_patent preventing a finding of likelihood of success on the merits

the specification of the ¡¬718_patent states in a list of definitions that`pharmaceutically acceptable as used herein means those compounds which are within the scope of sound_medical_judgment suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower_animals without undue_toxicity irritation allergic_response and the like in keeping with a reasonable_benefit/risk_ratio and effective for their intended use in the chemotherapy and prophylaxis of antimicrobial_infections'
in my judgment the district_courts claim_construction is ambiguous as to whether the pharmaceutically acceptable_polymer must extend release or whether it can be part of a matrix in which other_components extend the release
sandoz is correct that there needs to be some showing that the polymer acts to extend release

abbott specifically carved out azithromycin from its definition of an erythromycin_derivative in the ¡¬718_patent
see andrx 452 f.3d at 1337

in andrx this court relied primarily on the ¡¬190_patent as combined with the ¡¬422_publication to find that there was a substantial_question as to the obviousness of the ¡¬718_patent_claims
452 f.3d at 1340-41
first we concluded that` teva makes substantial arguments that the ¡¬190_patent discloses a clarithromycin composition.. that arguably has the pharmacokinetic_parameters required in claim 4 of the ¡¬ 718 patent'
id.at 1340
and we explained because the ¡¬190_patent explicitly discloses only clarithromycin controlled release_compositions yet claims azithromycin compositions.. abbott has represented to the [ pto ] that the differences between clarithromycin and azithromycin were such that azithromycin could be substituted into a controlled release clarithromycin composition by a person of ordinary_skill in the art without undue_experimentation.. as a result based on abbotts own ¡¬190_patent there exists a substantial argument that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would be motivated to combine the ¡¬422_publication namely the use of hpmc in extended_release macrolide compositions with the ¡¬190_patent with a reasonable_expectation of success
id.at 1341
in this case abbott presented evidence at trial suggesting that this court was scientifically incorrect to find that the ¡¬ 190 patent disclosed compounds that arguably had the same_pk_values as the asserted claims
sandoz based on this new_evidence disclaimed any reliance on the scientific evidence of the ¡¬190_patent disclosing compounds with the same_pk_values as the ¡¬718_patent
however contrary to the majority_opinion sandoz can rely on andrxs conclusion that it would have been obvious for a person skilled in the art to substitute clarithromycin for azithromycin in an extended_release_formula with the anticipation of success without undue_experimentation

given ksrs broad understanding of nearly all or perhaps all inventions being combinations of elements in the prior_art the parties dispute about whether ksr should be limited to such inventions becomes largely irrelevant
in any event while ksrs holding is directed particularly at the tsm_test it certainly appears that the court intended to expound principles of obviousness jurisprudence that were generally applicable
and particularly relevant to the case at bar this court has already applied ksrs teachings to the question of whether new chemical compositions are obvious in light of the fact that chemists of ordinary_skill would attempt to modify known substances in certain ways to` obtain compounds with improved properties'
takeda 492 f.3d at 1356
accordingly i think the district_court clearly erred in concluding that ksr was not relevant to the question of obviousness here
6
see also pfizer inc. v. apotex inc. 480_f.3d_1348 1362 fed.cir.2007` [ it ] is irrelevant [ to the question of obviousness ] that none of the anions specifically listed in the ¡¬909_patent have a cyclic structure because the motivation to make amlodipine besylate here is gleaned not only from the prior_art as a whole rather than the ¡¬909_patent alone but also from the nature of the problems encountered with the amlodipine maleate tablet formulations sought to be solved by the inventors of the ¡¬303_patent`

the written description of the ¡¬718_patent states that` the mean_dfl_values for the controlled release_formulation [ another abbott prior_art reference disclosing a clarithromycin_formulation ] and for the ir are substantially equal in value..' ¡¬718_patent col.11 ll.18-19
and it explains that lower dfl_values for the er_formulation of the ¡¬718_patent show that it provides` less variable clarithromycin concentrations throughout the day than the ir and the sustained_release_compositions'
¡¬ 718 patent col.11 ll.25-26
these statements were correct based on three studies that had been done prior to filing the application
however a new study w98-268 which gustavson had knowledge of and which issued while the application was pending found that there was a statistically significant lower dfl value for the sustained release formulas than the ir formulas
gustavson however failed to disclose the results of this new study
