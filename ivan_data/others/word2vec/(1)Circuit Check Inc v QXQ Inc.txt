moore circuit_judge
circuit_check inc. appeals from the eastern_district of wisconsins judgment as a matter of law after a jury_verdict that claims of u.s. patent nos._7592,796 ; 7,695,766 ; and 7,749,566 are invalid as obvious
we reverse the courts judgment as a matter of law and remand

background
manufacturers of circuit_boards which are used in various electronic devices use circuit_board_testers to test circuit_boards before the boards are integrated into finished products
many testers require an interface_plate which is a plastic grid with holes that permit connections between the tester and the circuit board
in order to align circuit_boards during testing it is advantageous to mark certain_holes on the interface_plate
prior art methods of marking interface_plates included placing mylar masks on the surface of the interface_plate painting the surface of interface_plates and making shallow drill marks on interface_plates

the patents at issue claim systems and methods related to marking interface_plates
claim 1 of the ¡¬796_patent is representative 1
an indicator interface_plate configured to provide readily visible identification of predetermined holes the plate comprising a surface including a plurality of holes having visually discernable markings to allow a user to visually determine which of said plurality of holes are to be populated wherein a region of the plate said plurality of holes have a first predetermined indicia covering the surface surrounding said plurality of holes the plate further comprising a second_removable_indicia overlying said first predetermined indicia said second_indicia being different from said first predetermined indicia wherein said second_indicia is removed from areas of said plate adjacent each of said predetermined holes said predetermined holes are visually identifiable to a user by the appearance of the first indicia
¡¬796_patent col.6 ll.36-51 emphases added

circuit_check sued qxq inc. alleging that qxqs interface_plates infringed its patents
qxq stipulated to infringement and the parties stipulated that three references describing interface_plate marking techniques were prior_art to the patents the ttci specifications ; the plexus specification ; and the method depicted in figure 1 of the ¡¬796_patent and described in its specification collectively the` stipulated prior_art'
j.a.1983-84
these documents disclosed several marking techniques such as painting near the hole or drilling near the hole and painting over the drill mark
qxq concedes in its briefing that the stipulated prior_art does not disclose an interface_plate comprising` a second_removable_indicia overlying said first predetermined indicia.. wherein said second_indicia is removed from areas of said plate adjacent each of said predetermined holes'
¡¬796_patent col.6 ll.45-50

at trial qxq argued that three additional references-rock_carvings engraved signage and a machining_technique known as prussian_blue collectively the` disputed prior_art' -disclose the limitation not present in the stipulated prior_art and constitute analogous_prior_art
circuit_check argued that the references were not analogous
with respect to rock_carvings in which a varnish is applied to rocks and then scrapped off to make designs circuit_check presented testimony that a skilled_artisan at the time of the invention would not have considered rock_carvings to have been reasonably pertinent to the marking *1334 problem
j.a
1388 1447
with respect to engraved signage in which the top layer of a multi-layer product is removed to expose a bottom layer circuit_check presented testimony that engraved signage was not relevant to the problem solved by the patents
j.a
1388 1434
and with respect to prussian_blue a machining_technique whereby dye is applied to a workpiece and then removed by a scribe or drill circuit_check presented testimony that prussian_blue could not be used to make the claimed invention and had no connection to the problem solved by the patents
j.a
1387-88 1397 1430-32 1443-44

the validity of claims 1 2 3 5 6 8 10 11 13 and 14 of the ¡¬ 796 patent ; claims 1 2 3 5 7 8 9 11 12 and 14 of the ¡¬766_patent ; and claims 1 2 3 5 7 8 9 11 and 12 of the ¡¬566_patent was submitted to the jury
the jury found the asserted claims not invalid for obviousness
j.a
1995-96
the jury also found that the infringement was willful and awarded damages
j.a
1996-97

after the jury_verdict qxq filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law that the asserted claims are invalid as obvious
the district_court granted qxqs motion acknowledging that qxqs` obviousness argument is not premised on citing specific examples of prior_art in the applicable field nor does it rely on nuanced discussion about the level of ordinary_skill in that particular field'
j.a
6
it found that although there was no doubt that rock_carvings` are not technically pertinent to thefield of circuit testers' and` witnesses credibly testified that prussian_blue_dye had not been used on alignment plates'` any layman' would have understood that interface_plates could be marked using the techniques described in the disputed prior_art
j.a
8
it further noted that` any vandal who haskeyed a car knows that stripping the paint with a key will result in the underlying metal color showing through'
j.a
5
it found that none of the objective_considerations affected its conclusion that the asserted claims would have been obvious
j.a
13
with respect to claims 5_and_11 of the ¡¬796_patent the court determined that even though qxq did not present evidence that the additional_limitations of the claims would have been obvious those additional_limitations were too trivial to support nonobviousness

discussion
judgment as a matter of law is permitted on an issue following jury trial if` the court finds that a reasonable_jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue'

we review a district_courts grant of judgment as a matter of law after a jury_verdict de novo
spectralytics inc. v. cordis corp. 649_f.3d_1336 1341 fed.cir.2011
under seventh circuit law we can overturn a jurys decision only if no rational jury could have come to the same conclusion
e.e.o.c
v. autozone inc. 707_f.3d_824 834-35 7th cir.2013
in reviewing a jurys obviousness verdict` [ w ] e first presume that the jury resolved the underlying factual disputes in favor of the verdict winner and leave those presumed findings undisturbed if they are supported by substantial_evidence
then we examine the legal_conclusion de novo to see whether it is correct in light of the presumed jury fact findings'
jurgens v. mckasy 927_f.2d_1552 1557 fed.cir.1991 citations omitted

a patent is invalid for obviousness` if the differences between the subject_matter sought to be patented and the prior_art are such that the subject_matter as a *1335 whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary_skill in the art to which said subject_matter pertains'
35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a 20061` obviousness is a question of law based on underlying factual findings..' kinetic concepts inc. v. smith & nephew inc. 688_f.3d_1342 1360 fed.cir.2012
the underlying factual inquiries include 1 the scope and content of the prior_art 2 the differences between the prior_art and the claims at issue 3 the level of ordinary_skill in the art and 4 any relevant objective_considerations such as commercial_success long felt but unsolved needs and the failure of others
graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 17-18 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966)

by finding the claims nonobvious the jury presumably found that the disputed prior_art is not analogous and therefore not within the scope of the prior_art
see jurgens 927 f.2d at 1557
substantial_evidence supports the jurys presumed finding
to be considered within the prior_art for purposes of the obviousness analysis a reference must be analogous
wang labs. inc. v. toshiba corp. 993_f.2d_858 864 fed.cir.1993
whether a reference is analogous_art is a question of fact
wyers v. master lock co. 616_f.3d_1231 1237 fed.cir.2010
prior art is analogous if it is from the same field of endeavor or if it is reasonably pertinent to the particular_problem the inventor is trying to solve
id

the jury was instructed that` the field of the invention is circuit_board_testers and test fixtures used in the manufacture of electronics'
j.a
1984
the disputed prior_art-rock_carvings engraved signage and prussian_blue-is not part of the field of circuit_board_testers and test figures
therefore the disputed prior_art can be analogous only if it is reasonably pertinent to the particular_problem solved by the inventor
wyers 616 f.3d at 1237
although` familiar items may have obvious uses beyond their primary purposes' ksr int l co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 420 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007) a reference is only reasonably pertinent when it` logically would have commended itself to an inventors attention in considering his problem' in re_clay 966_f.2d_656 659 fed.cir.1992
the jury heard testimony that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would not have thought about rock_carvings engraved signage or prussian_blue in considering how to mark interface_plates
j.a
1387-88 1397 1430-32 1434 1443-44 1447
the jury was entitled to weigh this testimony find that an ordinarily skilled_artisan would not find that the disputed prior_art` logically would have commended itself to an inventors attention' and thus find the disputed prior_art not analogous
see in re_clay 966 f.2d at 659

just because keying a car for example is within the common_knowledge of humankind does not mean that keying a car is analogous_art
an alleged infringer should not be able to transform all systems and methods within the common_knowledge into analogous_prior_art simply by stating that anyone would have known of such a system or method
the question is not whether simple concepts such as rock_carvings engraved signage or prussian_blue_dye are within the knowledge of lay people or even within the knowledge of a person of ordinary_skill in the art
rather the question is whether an inventor would look to this particular art to solve the particular_problem at hand
here circuit_check put forward evidence that *1336 an inventor would not have considered the disputed prior_art when trying to improve marking
it is not hard to arrive at that conclusion
even though an inventor may be aware of rock_carvings it is not surprising that the inventor would not have looked to rock_carvings to improve the process of painting small dots on interface_plates for expensive circuit_board_testers
and even though an inventor may work in an office with engraved signage the inventor would not necessarily have considered using the techniques disclosed in engraved signage to solve the problem of marking circuit board tester interface_plates
finally even though an inventor in this case was aware of prussian_blue it is not surprising that one of skill in the art would not consider using a machining_technique that employed removable dye on interface_plates where such dye could fall into and interfere with the underlying electronics of the circuit_board_testers
because the jurys presumed finding that the disputed references are not analogous is supported by substantial_evidence the only references within the scope of the prior_art are the stipulated prior_art

substantial_evidence also supports the jurys presumed finding that the differences between the stipulated prior_art and the claims were significant
the nature of the differences between the prior_art and the claims is a question of fact
graham 383 u.s. at 17-18 86_s.ct._684
indeed as qxq acknowledges the stipulated prior_art fails to disclose an interface_plate with the claimed` second_removable_indicia'
appellees br
29
a reasonable_jury could have concluded that qxq did not prove by clear and convincing evidence that the differences between the prior_art and the claimed invention were insignificant
the stipulated prior_art does not disclose what makes the patented claims unique placing a second_removable_indicia on top of the interface_plate and then selectively removing that layer to identify certain_holes on the interface_plate
additionally circuit_check presented testimony that the stipulated prior_art taught away from the invention
the jury heard testimony that manufacturer specifications contemplated minimizing the amount of paint on interface_plates because paint had a tendency to chip off and fall into the tester which caused serious problems
j.a
1362 1372
it also heard testimony that the specifications counselled against covering the entire interface_plate with paint
j.a
1372-73
thus substantial_evidence supports the jurys presumed finding that one of skill would not have been motivated to use more paint to cover the entire surface of the interface_plate.2

substantial_evidence supports the jurys presumed findings that objective_considerations existed to support nonobviousness
whether objective_considerations support a conclusion of nonobviousness is a question of fact
graham 383 u.s. at 17-18 86_s.ct._684
because the jury rendered a general verdict that the claims were not obvious we must presume that they found in favor of circuit_check on all relevant questions supported by substantial_evidence
see jurgens 927 f.2d at 1557
circuit_check presented evidence of copying long-felt need commercial_success skepticism and unexpected_results
with respect to copying the jury heard testimony that qxq developed its infringing plates after a customer saw circuit *1337 check products embodying the invention and asked qxq to mark its interface_plates by painting the surface and then selectively removing the paint
j.a
1409-10 1520-21
with respect to long-felt need the jury heard testimony that the industry tried multiple prior_art marking methods preceding circuit_checks invention
j.a
1359-62
with respect to commercial_success the jury heard testimony that once circuit_checks customers received products embodying the patents they refused to return to interface_plates using the prior_art marking methods
j.a
1409
with respect to skepticism the jury heard testimony that circuit_checks customers were worried about using the new interface_plates because the claimed method increased the amount of paint on the interface_plate and therefore increased the likelihood that paint would flake off and damage the testers
j.a
1373 1405
and with respect to unexpected_results the jury heard testimony that a skilled_artisan would have been surprised that because paint was likely to fall into the tester increasing the amount of paint used would produce desirable interface_plates
j.a
1370-71 1373 1379-80
having been presented with this testimony the jury is entrusted to weigh evidence and credibility in making its findings
the jurys presumed findings regarding objective_considerations are therefore supported by substantial_evidence

regarding the legal_conclusion of obviousness the jurys presumed findings regarding the scope and content of the prior_art differences between the claimed invention and the stipulated prior_art and objective_considerations of nonobviousness are supported by substantial_evidence
under these circumstances a reasonable_jury could have concluded that the subject_matter as a whole would not have been obvious at the time of the invention
the court erred by granting judgment as a matter of law

finally the court erred by invalidating dependent claims 5_and_11
although the court acknowledged that qxq presented no evidence that the additional_limitations in those claims were present in the prior_art and presented no evidence that the additional_limitations were trivial it concluded that these claims were obvious because circuit_check the patentee did not explain why the additional_limitations rendered the claims non-obvious
j.a
22
the court erred in shifting the burden of production to disprove invalidity
`` each claim of a patent.. shall be presumed valid independently of the validity of other claims ; dependent or multiple dependent claims shall be presumed valid even though dependent upon an invalid claim'
35 u.s.c.¡± 282
additionally` [ t ] he burden of establishing invalidity of a patent or any claim thereof shall rest on the party asserting such invalidity'
id
although` in many cases a person of ordinary_skill will be able to fit the teachings of multiple patents together like pieces of a puzzle' there must be evidence presented on the obviousness of the claim as a whole
ksr 550 u.s. at 420 127_s.ct._1727
even assuming that the claims from which these claims depend are invalid it was improper for the court to invalidate the claims absent any evidence regarding the additional_limitations of these claims

whatever doubts we have about these patents the jury_verdict was supported by substantial_evidence
we therefore reverse the district_courts grant of judgment as a matter of law and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion

reversed and remanded
