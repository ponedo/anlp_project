opinion
lourie circuit_judge telsmith inc. appeals from a decision of the united_states_district_court for the eastern_district of wisconsin holding that nordberg inc. did not engage in inequitable_conduct during the prosecution of u.s. patent 4,478,373 and finding that the case was not` exceptional' under 35 u.s.c.¡± 285
nordberg inc. v. telsmith inc. 881_f.supp._1252 36_uspq2d_1577_(e.d.wis.1995)
because telsmith has not demonstrated error in the courts decision we affirm

background
nordberg owner of the373_patent directed to a gyratory_rock_crusher sued telsmith for infringement
telsmith counterclaimed for a declaration that the asserted claims were invalid unenforceable and not infringed
after a bench trial the district_court found that the asserted claims were invalid for obviousness over the prior_art which included nordbergs own saunders u.s. patent 3,125,304
the court also held that the claims were invalid based on nordbergs public use of the claimed invention at a quarry owned and operated by the tanner company in phoenix arizona more than one year before the filing date of the patent application
nordberg has not appealed these determinations

although holding the patent invalid the court rejected telsmiths claim that the patent was unenforceable because of nordbergs conduct
the court found that the saunders_patent and tanner_use constituted material_prior_art that was not disclosed to the united states patent and trademark_office` pto' during prosecution of the373_patent
the court also found however that the nordberg_employees who were under a duty of disclosure including those who prosecuted the373_patent were unaware of the existence of the saunders_patent during prosecution
thus the court found that nordberg did not conceal the saunders_patent
the court further found that the relevant_nordberg_employees did not conceal the tanner_use from the pto with the intent to mislead because they believed in good_faith that the field testing at tanner occurred under a confidentiality_agreement and thus was not material_prior_art
because the court found no intention by nordberg to mislead the pto it held that nordberg did not engage in inequitable_conduct

discussion
we review the district_courts conclusion concerning inequitable_conduct for abuse of discretion
molins_plc v. textron inc. 48_f.3d_1172 1178 33_uspq2d_1823 1827 fed.cir.1995
an abuse of discretion may be established by showing that the court based its ruling on clearly erroneous factual findings an error of law or a clear_error of judgment
id

telsmith challenges the courts determination that nordberg did not engage in inequitable_conduct
* telsmith asserts that nordberg knew or should have known of the saunders_patent because nordberg owned the patent and a copy of the patent was in its files which nordberg allegedly routinely searched before filing patent applications
in addition telsmith argues that a nordberg memorandum stating that the tanner_use might pose patentability problems in` absolute_novelty' countries compels the inference that nordberg knew that the tanner_use was material_prior_art
telsmith further contends that the high materiality of the saunders_patent and the tanner_use requires an inference of an intent by nordberg to mislead the pto which nordberg did not rebut

we consider these contentions to be unpersuasive
the district_court found that the nordberg_employees who were under a duty of disclosure were unaware of the saunders_patent during prosecution of the373_patent
this finding is not clearly *397 erroneous
although a copy of the saunders_patent was in nordbergs files the files contained several hundred patents and there was no showing that any nordberg employee actually searched the files and found a copy of the saunders_patent during the pendency of the373_patent application
moreover the unrebutted testimony of nordbergs in-house patent counsel indicated that regular searching of in-house prior_art files began only recently after the prosecution of the373_patent
thus the court did not clearly err in finding that the relevant_nordberg_employees were unaware of the saunders_patent during prosecution
furthermore since nordberg could not have` concealed' a prior_art_reference of which it was unaware the district_court did not clearly err in finding that nordberg did not conceal the saunders_patent with the intent to mislead the pto

telsmith seeks to overcome the fatal lack of evidence that the relevant_nordberg_employees knew of the saunders_patents existence by contending that` federal circuit precedent does not require proof of actual_knowledge of the withheld prior_art but only.. proof that the applicant or its representativesshould have known of the art or information` citing our decisions in molins_plc 48 f.3d at 1178 33 uspq2d at 1826 and fmc_corp. v. manitowoc co. 835_f.2d_1411 1415 5_uspq2d_1112 1116 fed.cir.1987
we long ago rejected this contention american_hoist & derrick co. v. sowa & sons inc. 725_f.2d_1350 1362 220_uspq_763 772 fed.cir
(` nor does an applicant for patent who has no duty to conduct a prior_art search have an obligation to disclose any art of which in the [ district ] courts words hereasonably should be aware
`` cert
denied 469_u.s._821 105_s.ct._95 83_l.ed.2d_41_(1984) and neither fmc_corp. nor molins_plc held to the contrary
indeed our decision in fmc_corp. far from supporting telsmiths position is directly to the contrary
there was no dispute in that case that the patentee knew of the undisclosed informations existence ; only knowledge of the informations materiality was in dispute
835 f.2d at 1416 5 uspq2d at 1116
after noting that proof that the applicant knew of a references materiality` may be rebutted by a showing that.. [ the ] applicant did not know of that art or information' we discussed the` should have known' standard in connection with the references materiality applicant must be chargeable with knowledge of the existence of the prior_art or information for it is impossible to disclose the unknown
similarly an applicant must be chargeable with knowledge of the materiality of the art or information ; yet an applicant who knew of the art or information can not intentionally avoid learning of its materiality through gross negligence i.e. it may be found that the applicant` should have known' of that materiality
id.at 1415 835_f.2d_1411 5 uspq2d at 1115-16 citation omitted
similarly in molins_plc we simply observed that` [ o ] ne who alleges inequitable_conduct arising from a failure to disclose prior_art must offer clear and convincing proof of' inter alia` knowledge chargeable to the applicant of that prior_art'
48 f.3d at 1178 33 uspq2d at 1826
it was undisputed that the applicant in molins_plc knew of the existence of the undisclosed references and the case thus can not stand for the proposition that telsmith would have us draw from it
telsmiths contention that the` failure of disclosure' form of inequitable_conduct can be shown with proof that the applicant did not but should have known of a references existence runs counter to american_hoist and subsequent cases and must therefore be rejected
as we held in american_hoist the applicants actual_knowledge of the references existence must be proved

the court also found that the nordberg_employees who were under a duty of disclosure believed in good_faith that the tanner_use occurred under a confidentiality_agreement and thus was not material_prior_art
again telsmith has not demonstrated that this finding is clearly erroneous
telsmith relies on an internal nordberg memorandum which stated in relevant part since the machine has been put in the field even though a confidentiality exists between ourselves and tanner it could be construed because of the relatively open location near the airport and the free visiting *398 by various dealer personnel that the machine may not be patentable in the absolute_novelty_countries because of disclosure
this may be a negative factor in the potential and value for licensing the machine to our present licensees or for providing initial advantage to the marketing efforts of our overseas locations once the machine becomes a product
since the memorandum states that` a confidentiality [ agreement ] exists between [ nordberg ] and tanner' it supports rather than undermines the district_courts finding that the relevant_nordberg_employees believed in good_faith that the tanner_use occurred under a confidentiality_agreement and therefore was not material_prior_art
furthermore since the united states is not an` absolute_novelty' country the statement that the invention` may not be patentable in the absolute_novelty_countries' is not necessarily inconsistent with let alone sufficient to establish clear_error in the courts finding that nordberg believed that the tanner_use was not material_prior_art
thus because the court did not clearly err in finding that nordberg believed that the tanner_use was not material_prior_art the court did not clearly err in finding that nordberg did not conceal the tanner_use with the intent to mislead the pto

telsmith has accordingly not shown that the district_court clearly erred in finding that nordberg did not conceal the saunders_patent and/or the tanner_use with the intent to mislead the pto
furthermore because telsmith did not make a threshold showing of intent by nordberg to mislead the pto nordberg had no burden to produce evidence of good_faith and the court properly declined to balance materiality and intent
we have considered telsmiths remaining allegations of a` pattern of misconduct and deception' by nordberg but find them unpersuasive
we therefore conclude that the district_court did not abuse its discretion in holding that nordberg did not engage in inequitable_conduct

telsmith also argues that the district_court erred in finding that this was not an` exceptional' case under 35 u.s.c.¡± 285
we disagree with telsmith
the court did not abuse its discretion in holding that nordberg did not engage in inequitable_conduct and it did not err in rejecting telsmiths contention that nordberg commenced and continued litigating this case in bad faith
thus the court did not clearly err in finding that this was not an` exceptional' case under 35 u.s.c.¡± 285

in its brief nordberg alleges that telsmiths appeal was frivolous
during oral_argument however nordberg withdrew its allegation after the court pointed out that it was substantively and procedurally deficient
see fed.r.app.p
38 requiring separately filed motion or notice from the court and opportunity to respond
an allegation of a frivolous appeal should not be made cavalierly
we caution nordberg and its counsel that` [ u ] nfounded requests for sanctions are themselves frivolous and sanctionable'
atlantic thermoplastics co. v. faytex corp. 970_f.2d_834 835_n._1 23_uspq2d_1481 1482_n._1_(fed.cir.1992)

while telsmith was entitled to appeal the denial of its claim its counsel was not entitled to disrupt the oral_argument with a display of temper
during his rebuttal argument counsel turned around pointed a finger at opposing counsel and heatedly said` these two lawyers are bad lawyers
they deceived the examiners they deceived the trial judge and then they pull this here'
this court is accustomed to hearing forceful argument
however counsels outburst was unacceptable
strong conviction concerning the merits of ones case is not justification for losing ones composure at oral_argument and making pointed accusations at opposing counsel
opposing attorneys are expected to disagree concerning the merits of their cases
however the essence of legal process is rational and civil advocacy of ones position
angry intemperate verbal attacks have no place in this court

we caution counsel that improper conduct in the courtroom may be sanctionable
see fed.r.app.p
46 c conduct unbecoming a member of the bar is sanctionable
however because counsel promptly apologized for his remarks when he was admonished from the bench during argument we will let the *399 incident pass with a warning that such conduct is not acceptable
