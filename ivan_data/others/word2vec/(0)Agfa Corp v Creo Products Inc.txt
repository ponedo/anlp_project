synopsis
background patentee brought action against competitor alleging infringement of its patents for an automated computer-to-plate system for making multiple printing plates
the united_states_district_court for the district of massachusetts george a. o'toole jr. j. 2004_wl_2387288 declared all the asserted_patents unenforceable for inequitable_conduct and patentee appealed

holdings the court of appeals rader circuit_judge held that

trial_courts decision to hold a bench_trial on issue of patentees alleged inequitable_conduct did not preclude the courts later_grant of a jury_trial on issue of patents validity ;

term` stack' in the patents encompassed a number of plates arranged together in an orderly_fashion regardless of the orientation of the collection as a whole ;

undisclosed_prior_art during prosecution of patents was material ; and

evidence was sufficient to establish that patentee intended to deceive patent_examiner

i
large scale printing typically uses presses with plates made of materials such as aluminum or polyester
conventionally those plates are formed with a two-step method
the first step places a desired image on polyester film
the next step transfers that image to the printing plate
a light-sensitive chemical emulsion on the plate often facilitates that transfer
mounted on the printing press the plate then reproduces images in a conventional manner

unlike that conventional technique` computer-to-plate' ctp systems take a desired image which can include both written and graphic content and transfer that image directly from a computer onto the plate
these plates made with a ctp_system then substitute for conventionally formed plates
ctp_systems offer clear advantages over conventional methods of forming printing plates

agfa owns u.s. patent nos._5655,452 the452_patent ; 5,738,014 the014_patent ; 5,788,455 the455_patent ; 5,791,250 the250_patent ; 5,992,324 the324_patent ; and 6,000,337 the337_patent
those patents claim various features of agfas ctp_system i.e. its` galileo' system
as taught in the asserted_patents agfas galileo_system further improves ctp automation by facilitating the creation of multiple plates of different sizes
agfas patents all feature the same specification and drawings
figure 1 of the452_patent reproduced below is representative of agfas patented system

*1370. ?
as shown in that figure ctp_system 10 includes a computer 12 and image processor 14 linked to a platesetter 16
the platesetter includes a plate_handler 18 having a number of cassettes 24 which include stacks of plates 26
during operation the handler 18 can move the cassettes up or down such that a` picker' 28 can access any particular individual plate
each cassette can include up to 100 plates each separated from the adjoining plates by a protective` slip_sheet' which is automatically removed by a slip_sheet removal mechanism 25
while each cassette contains plates of the same size plate_size can differ from cassette to cassette
thus during operation the` picker' can change plate_size by selecting a different cassette

because the plates are light sensitive an operator loads the cassettes in a darkroom
after receiving the cassettes the system operates without human intervention
the system selects a plate and transfers it to the imaging_engine 22
the imaging_engine prints an image directly onto the plate
the claim_construction_dispute in this case however concerns the plate_handler 18
more specifically as discussed below the claim_construction_dispute concerns the meaning of the term` stack' that appears in every asserted claim

agfa and creo compete in the ctp market
agfa sued creo alleging that creos ctp_system infringed all of agfas galileo_patents
as a defense as well as a counterclaim creo asserted that all of agfas galileo_patents are unenforceable due to agfas inequitable_conduct before the united_states_patent and trademark_office pto
according to creo agfa wrongfully declined to disclose material_prior_art to the pto during prosecution of agfas asserted *1371 patents
specifically creo contended that agfa did not disclose at least three prior_art systems the creo_platesetter 3244 the barco_lithosetter and the gerber cressent/42
creo further asserted that this prior_art was more relevant to agfas applications than the single reference discussed in the specification common to all of agfas applications a u.s. patent on computer-to-film printing
decision slip op.at 24-25

the district_court severed the inequitable_conduct_issue from the rest of the case and over agfas objection conducted a bench_trial on that issue
at the conclusion of that trial the district_court declared all of agfas patents unenforceable
the district_court further concluded that agfas inequitable_conduct rendered the case exceptional and awarded attorneys fees under 35 u.s.c.¡± 285

a
jury trial issue
procedurally this case is almost indistinguishable from gardco manufacturing inc. v. herst_lighting_co. 820_f.2d_1209_(fed.cir.1987)
in gardco the plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment on the asserted invalidity unenforceability and non-infringement of a patent
id.at 1210
in the unenforceability and invalidity accusations the prior_art was the defendant-patentees own prior products which were not disclosed to the pto during examination
see id.at 1211 1213
the defendant counterclaimed for infringement and demanded a jury_trial
id
the trial_court in gardco then separated the inequitable_conduct_issue for trial without a jury
at the same time the district_court postponed for later if necessary a jury_trial on infringement and invalidity
id.at 1210
the bench_trial on inequitable_conduct determined that the asserted patent was not enforceable
id
for that reason the trial_court did not impanel a jury

gardco differs from this case in only two ways
due to the declaratory judgment posture the gardco parties were arranged differently i.e. with the accused infringer as plaintiff rather than defendant
gardco also featured inequitable_conduct as a separate_claim rather than as a defense to *1372 infringement
neither of those differences has any bearing on the question of the right to a jury_trial
see in re tech
licensing corp. 423_f.3d_1286 1288 1291 fed.cir.2005 right to jury_trial is examined without regard to the alignment of the parties or the posture of the issue i.e
a defense or separate_claim
thus this court confronts the same situation that gardco presented nearly twenty years ago
at that time this court sustained the trial_courts approach
gardco 820 f.2d at 1213
this court as it must sustains the gardco_reasoning in this case
nevertheless agfa presents two distinct reasons for this court to depart from gardco
this court declines that invitation

in the first place contrary to agfas assertion gardco is consistent with supreme_court precedent
in beacon_theatres inc. v. westover 359_u.s._500 79_s.ct._948 3_l.ed.2d_988_(1959) the supreme_court explained that a trial_judge could not conduct a bench_trial and preclude a jury_trial on equitable declaratory relief claims where that trial would resolve` common' issues with a claim subject to jury resolution
359 u.s. at 503-04 79_s.ct._948
in beacon_theatres the declaratory judgment plaintiff sought to raise essentially the same antitrust issues for which the declaratory_judgment_defendant sought a jury_trial
id
the supreme_court declined to limit the declaratory_judgment_defendants jury_trial rights solely` because fox took advantage of the availability of declaratory relief to sue beacon first'
id.at 504 79_s.ct._948
beacon_theatres specifically noted that both the petitioners claim and the declaratory relief claim involved` a common_issue'
id

this case involves issues of inequitable_conduct including the materiality of the undisclosed_prior_art and validity
although these issues overlap to some degree they are not` common' issues as in beacon_theatres
because this case does not involve` common' issues this court need not apply the beacon_theatres rule to honor agfas jury_trial_request
beacon_theatres did not use the term` overlapping'
while the inequitable_conduct and validity questions in this case overlap in the consideration of some aspects of the same relevant evidence they do not involve a common_issue
as gardco explained the simple fact is that a patent may be valid and yet be rendered unenforceable for misuse or inequitable_conduct
similarly a valid patent may be in the abstract infringed that is the accused device may fall within the scope of the claim but there will be no liability to the patentee when the patent is unenforceable
thus the conduct-of-the-applicant-in-the-pto issue raised in the nonjury_trial and the separated infringement/validity_issues are distinct and without commonality either as claims or in relation to the underlying fact issues
820 f.2d at 1213 footnote and emphasis omitted

this gardco_reasoning governs even in the face of 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 b
in that regulation the pto defines materiality as including information that establishes` a prima_facie_case of unpatentability'
37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 b 1
even though the definition of materiality i.e.` a prima_facie_case of unpatentability' may implicate some aspects of a validity analysis the issues of invalidity and materiality are still not common within the legal construct of beacon_theatres
as gardco explained a patent may be valid but not enforceable
thus inequitable_conduct and validity are *1373 not` common' issues as beacon_theatres applied that concept

moreover this courts recent decision in digital_control inc. v. charles machine works 437_f.3d_1309 1316 fed.cir.2006 explained that the ptos rule 56 did not supplant the earlier and arguably broader` reasonable_examiner' standard for materiality
digital_control suggests as well that material_prior_art need not even be invalidating prior_art
thus under the reasonable_examiner standard material_prior_art need not necessarily present a prima_facie_case of unpatentability
see id.at 1315 information is material` where there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable_examiner would consider it important in deciding whether to allow the application to issue as a patent'
( quoting an older version of rule 56
because the materiality of prior_art is distinct from validity_issues without even considering the additional intent requirement for inequitable_conduct this courts earlier reasoning in gardco remains sound
materiality therefore does not present common_issues with validity
because the issues are not` common' the beacon_theatres rule does not apply to protect afgas jury_trial_request

finally gardco explicitly considered and commented on the supreme_courts decisions including beacon_theatres and the later decisions relating to inequitable_conduct factors and validity factors
this panel could not depart from gardcos reasoning even if it accepted the suggestion that materiality and validity present a common_issue which it does not

in sum although this case involves both issues of inequitable_conduct and validity the decision to hold a bench_trial on inequitable_conduct does not preclude the trial_courts later_grant of a jury_trial
the beacon_theatres case does not mandate that these are` common_issues' that must be tried to a jury

scire facias
next contrary to agfas contentions gardco is consistent with some dicta in a footnote in in re lockwood 50_f.3d_966_(fed.cir.1995) vacated 515_u.s._1182 116_s.ct._29 132_l.ed.2d_911_(1995)
in lockwood this court confronted a request for a jury_trial in an action involving the validity of two patents
id.at 968
lockwood explained that` [ t ] he thrust of the [ seventh ] amendment was to preserve the right to jury_trial as it existed in 1791'
id.at 971
after citing tull v. united_states 481_u.s._412 417 107_s.ct._1831 95_l.ed.2d_365_(1987) for the proposition that the` seventh_amendmentrequire [ s ] a jury_trial on the merits in those actions that are analogous tosuits at common_law` lockwood discusses the writ of scire_facias
50 f.3d at 972 974_n._9
in that discussion the court remarks that` [ t ] he contemporary_analog of the writ is.. an action for a declaration of unenforceability due to inequitable_conduct not due to invalidity'
id.at 974_n._9
this court in lockwood next states that actions corresponding to a writ of scire_facias would give rise today to the right to a jury_trial
id
thus in its footnote 9 lockwood seemed to suggest that inequitable_conduct is analogous to a writ of scire_facias and because that writ would have ultimately been decided by a jury in 1791 it was wrong for the trial_court to decide the inequitable_conduct_issue without a jury
on close inspection however this commentary in lockwood does not disturb the gardco_reasoning

admittedly lockwoods analysis is easy to misread for the proposition that a writ of scire_facias is the historic_analog of *1374 inequitable_conduct
lockwood however did not speak in terms of historic_analogs to inequitable_conduct it instead spoke of inequitable_conduct as a potential` contemporary_analog' to scire_facias
id
lockwood was not examining inequitable_conduct with an eye toward the right to a jury_trial in 1791 rather this court explained that a writ of scire_facias was not so analogous to invalidity as to require a jury_trial
the footnote in lockwood noted the language in older opinions suggesting that the writ` was used to attack fraudulently obtained patents' id. and then suggested in passing that inequitable_conduct may serve as a better modern analog for the ancient writ

this courts use of the word` analog' in the footnote was unfortunate
in re technology licensing made the same point but with language less steeped in seventh_amendment jurisprudence
see 423 f.3d at 1290` the court in lockwood specifically stated that a proceeding on a writ of scire_facias was not analogous to a suit for a declaration of invalidity but was more akin to an action for inequitable_conduct'
( emphasis added citation omitted
a closer analysis than was needed in lockwood reveals that a writ of scire_facias was not in fact a suit at common_law analogous to modern inequitable_conduct

in eighteenth-century england patents did not undergo an examination at least as` examination' proceeds in modern patent systems
see edward c. walterscheid the early evolution of the united_states_patent law antecedents part 4 78 j. pat
trademark off
soc y 77 83 1996
instead the sovereign granted patents based solely on a petition and sworn affidavit from the inventor
in modern terms the early english patent system was a registration system
see id.at 83-84
without examination nearly every defect in a patent resulted from some false_representation made by the patentee
see w.m
hindmarch a treatise on the law relative to patent privileges for the sole use of inventions and the practice of obtaining letters patents for inventions 230 i.g
m'kinley & j.m.g
lescure 1847` [ i ] t is the duty of every one obtaining a grant from the queen to see that she is correctly informed respecting the grant
[ if ] the queen has been deceived in any material particular by a false_representation or suggestions of the grantee the patent will be wholly void'
( citations omitted2 for example the early english system would require a patentee to attest that the invention was a genuinely new improvement not already in the public domain
if the evidence later showed the contrary the court would characterize this defect as a misrepresentation rather than as anticipation the modern label for the same defect
see id.at 164` patentees.. must have represented to the crown that their inventions were such_improvements.. and if their inventions were not such_improvements as represented.. their patents are void by reason of the false_representation or suggestion made to the crown'
( footnote omitted
thus while` fraud' reasonably describes the various bases for voiding eighteenth century patents the actual history discloses that the conduct of the patentee was not the *1375 focus of a decision to void a patent.3 finally a litigant in england in the eighteenth century could also defend against patent infringement by raising the grounds for voiding a patent through a writ of scire_facias without seeking the writ at all
compare id.at 162` in an action brought upon a patent [ ] objections may be taken to it [ including ] that the queen has been deceived in some material particular'
with id.at 231` the various objections which can be taken to a patent for an invention by a person against whom the patentee may institute legal proceedings have already been considered ; and the law provides a remedy for the public by action of scire_facias in which similar objections may be taken..' citation omitted

in sum while a writ of scire_facias might be more akin to inequitable_conduct than to invalidity it certainly is not an historic_analog that would trigger a seventh_amendment right to a jury_trial
this court has consistently treated inequitable_conduct as an equitable_defense that may be adjudicated by the trial_court without a jury
gardco remains the law of this circuit and governs this case

contrary to the dissents analysis this court_today does not decide that the factual_issues underlying a charge of inequitable_conduct must be adjudicated by a judge
thus the dissents observation that juries sometimes render verdicts on unenforceability issues is entirely consistent with this courts decision
the court_today merely confirms what has been the law at least since gardco a judge retains the discretion to conduct a bench_trial on the equitable issue of unenforceability in the same case where invalidity is to be tried to a jury

b
inequitable conduct
1
claim construction
to reach inequitable_conduct the trial_court necessarily construed the claims
according to agfa the trial_court misconstrued the term` stack' common to all asserted claims
as a representative example of the asserted claims claim 1 of the452_patent recites 1
a method for automatically selecting a plate for imaging in an automated plate_handler comprising the steps of a. automatically positioning a plurality of stacks of plates stored in the plate_handler and placing a stack of the plate_size required for an imaging job in an access_position ; b. automatically separating and removing a single_plate from the stack of plates in the access_position and transferring the single_plate out of the plate_handler for imaging ; and
*1376 c. automatically removing a slip_sheet from on top of the stack of plates in the access_position
'452_patent col._11,_l._66- col._12,_l._11 emphasis added
agfa argues that the term` stack' covers only a horizontal_arrangement of plates like those shown in figure 1 of the452_patent reproduced above
the trial_court disagreed construing stack as` encompassing a number of plates arranged together in an orderly_fashion regardless of the orientation horizontal or vertical of the collection as a whole'
decision slip op.at 22
this court perceives that the trial_courts construction and its reasoning leading to that construction is sound

the trial_court first consulted the ordinary_meaning of` stack' for which it cited a dictionary definition
as this court explained in phillips v. awh corp. the ordinary_meaning of some claim_terms` may be readily apparent even to lay judges and claim_construction in such_cases involves little more than the application of widely accepted meaning of commonly understood words'
415_f.3d_1303 1314 fed.cir.2005 en banc citation omitted
`` in such_cases general purpose dictionaries may be helpful'
id
this case falls squarely within those guidelines from phillips
the customary meaning within this field of art does not limit the term` stack'

the meaning of the claim_language does not limit` stack' to plates arranged one on top of another
accordingly when a stack is tilted more than 45 degrees it remains a stack because the plates are still arranged in a top-to-bottom_fashion
after all the top of a plate remains its top even when that plate tilts beyond 45 degrees
in other words the relationship of plates in a stack depends on the orientation of those plates relative to one another
the orientation of the resulting stack from the vantage point of elements outside the stack is irrelevant

moreover nothing in the disclosures of the asserted_patents suggests that` stack' has any meaning in the art that would limit its scope to horizontal_stacks
the trial_court buttressed its construction with the observation that three of the asserted_patents include dependent_claims that further specify a horizontal or other particular arrangement of the claimed stacks
see e.g.250_patent col._12,_ll._16-18 claim 2` the method according to claim 1 wherein the stacks of plates stored in the plate_handler are positioned substantially horizontally`
properly applying the claim differentiation guideline in the context of dependent_claims the trial_court correctly found support for the proposition that those dependent_claims suggest that the` stack' standing alone is not limited to horizontally positioned stacks
see curtiss-wright flow control corp. v. velan inc. 438_f.3d_1374 1380 fed.cir.2006 explaining the presumption that independent_claims do not include the limitations added by their dependent_claims

similar to this court in phillips itself the trial_court declined to limit these patent claims to their preferred_embodiment
the asserted_patents indeed depict a horizontal_arrangement of stacks as the preferred_embodiment
see e.g.452_patent figure 1 reproduced above ; elements 26 are the stacks
as noted this court has repeatedly rejected the contention that depiction of a single_embodiment in a patent necessarily limits the claims to that depicted scope
see phillips 415 f.3d at 1323
this case illustrates again the reason for this courts refusal to limit broader claim_language to a preferred_embodiment in the patent specification
of necessity any depiction *1377 of any stack will necessarily show that stack arranged in a particular manner
nothing beyond that depiction however limits the claim_language-the defining portion of the patent document-to some particular orientation
without any indication beyond the necessary depiction to suggest limiting the invention to this single_embodiment the broader language of the claims can not carry that unexpressed and unintended at the time of patent drafting limitation

2
materiality
unenforceability due to inequitable_conduct requires proof of materiality and intent by clear and convincing_evidence
kingsdown_med consultants ltd. v. hollister inc. 863_f.2d_867 872 fed.cir.1988
upon finding evidence that satisfies a threshold measure of materiality and intent the trial_court then weighs that evidence to determine that the equities warrant a conclusion of inequitable_conduct
molins plc v. textron inc. 48_f.3d_1172 1178 fed.cir.1995
in evaluating materiality the trial_court followed the standard set forth in pto rule 56
that rule considers information material to patentability when [ i ] t is not cumulative to information already of record or being made of record in the application and
( 1 it establishes by itself or in combination with other information a prima_facie_case of unpatentability of a claim ; or
( 2 it refutes or is inconsistent with a position the applicant takes in i opposing an argument of unpatentability relied on by the office or
( ii asserting an argument of patentability
37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 b 2004
the trial_court found that the information withheld by agfa satisfied both parts 1 and 2 of that rule
with respect to prima facie unpatentability part 1 of rule 56 the trial_court focused on prior_art ctp_systems patents and brochures
this prior_art taken alone or in combination established a prima_facie_case of unpatentability for claims in each of agfas asserted_patents
the primary challenge to the trial_courts materiality finding was that an incorrect claim_construction caused error in findings of materiality
because as discussed above the trial_courts claim_construction was correct these challenges of error fail

the trial_court also found that the undisclosed_prior_art was inconsistent with agfas position during examination and so was also material under part 2 of rule 56
decision slip op.at 45
during examination of two of agfas applications the examiner requested clarification about the ctp_technology described in the background sections
in particular the examiner wished to know what aspects of the ctp_technology described in the background were actually conventional
the trial_court found that agfas responses to the examiner` were misleading in light of all the information [ the patent agents ] had about the undisclosed ctp references..
indeed [ one of the patent_agents ] admitted that he could not have made the arguments he did make in response to the examiners request if he had disclosed the creo_platesetter 3244 or the barco_lithosetter..' id

on appeal agfa responds that rule 56` does not provide that amisleading statement is material'
appellants brief at 56
this contention belies the weakness of agfas position
the trial_court did not find that the misleading_statements were *1378 material
instead the trial_court found that undisclosed_prior_art was material because it was inconsistent with agfas misleading_statements to the examiner during prosecution

3
intent
turning to intent the trial_court found abundant evidence from which to infer agfas culpable intent
decision slip op.at 41-45
for example the evidence regarding agfas knowledge of the creo_platesetter 3244 was overwhelming senior agfa employees including an inventor named on all the asserted_patents and the agents who prosecuted the applications attended an exposition put on by agfa at which creos product was displayed ; agfa and creo entered into a reseller agreement under which agfa agreed to sell creos platesetter outside the united_states ; and agfa distributed brochures describing creos products
id
slip op.at 4-5
in the words of the trial_court` [ i ] t was widely known within agfa including among the engineering and patent departments that agfa was selling creos platesetter 3244 and that creo was a significant player in the field of ctp output devices'
id
slip op.at 5
in addition to agfas particular familiarity with creos platesetter the trial_court explained that agfa was well aware of other ctp prior_art
according to the trial_court during development of the galileo project agfa kept a spreadsheet entitled` overview of [ ctp ] products'
id
slip op.at 7
the inventors common to all agfas asserted_patents possessed that spreadsheet including its information on the creo_platesetter 3244 the barco lithosetter and the gerber crescent/42
id
based on agfas extensive knowledge of the prior_art the trial_court reasoned that` [ agfas ] failure to disclose information about [ the various ] ctp_systems to the [ pto ] supports an inference of intent to deceive because patentability arguments could not have been made had the withheld information been disclosed'
id. slip op.at 42

both the evidence and the law support the trial_courts intent determination
this court has held that a trial_court may infer deceptive_intent based on a showing that a patentee withheld references with which it was intimately familiar and which were inconsistent with its own patentability arguments to the pto

`` [ a ] patentee facing a high level of materiality and clear proof that it knew or should have known of that materiality can expect to find it difficult to establish subject good faith sufficient to prevent the drawing of an inference of intent to mislead'

on appeal agfa questions the trial_courts intent_finding based on its claim_construction_argument
specifically agfa argues that regardless of the proper meaning of` stack' it understood that term as applying only to horizontal_stacks
accordingly agfa contends that it should not be charged with knowledge of materiality under a claim_construction it did not anticipate
without knowledge of materiality agfa argues the trial_court can not properly infer intent

to the contrary the trial_court found agfas assertion that its patent_agents did not appreciate the materiality of the undisclosed references or that they unintentionally withheld those references not credible
specifically the trial_court relied on the substantial documentation and internal discussions of those references in the design *1379 and creation of the galileo_system
this court must defer heavily to the trial_courts credibility determinations
jvw enters. inc. v. interact accessories inc. 424_f.3d_1324 1334 fed.cir.2005` [ c ] redibility determinations by the trial_judge can virtually never be clear_error'
( citations and internal_quotes omitted

in addition agfas claim_construction_argument seems to assume that it had no obligation to submit prior_art that did not include horizontal_stacks
in agfas words` [ w ] hen stack is given its ordinary_meaning of objects placed one on top of another the ctp references that disclose vertically-oriented plates clearly do not establish a prima_facie_case of anticipation'
appellants brief at 39 emphasis added
thus agfa seeks to confine the material references that support an intent_finding to only those references that anticipate the claimed invention
materiality is not synonymous with anticipation but instead embraces the broader_concept of patentability
thus even if agfas assertions about its understanding of` stack' during prosecution were accepted the undisclosed_prior_art would still have been material because some but not all of that art included horizontally arranged stacks
see id.at 40

with respect to the324_patent that patent is a continuation of the014_patent about which the district_court made specific findings
thus fox_industries inc. v. structural preservation systems inc. 922_f.2d_801_(fed.cir.1990) supports the trial_courts decision regarding the324_patent
fox_industries explains that inequitable_conduct` early in the prosecution may render unenforceable all claims which eventually issue from the same or a related application'
id.at 804
later applications are of course not always tainted by the inequitable_conduct of earlier applications
see baxter int l inc. v. mcgaw inc. 149_f.3d_1321 1332 fed.cir.1998` [ w ] here the claims are subsequently separated from those tainted by inequitable_conduct through a divisional_application and where the issued claims have no relation to the omitted prior_art the patent issued from the divisional_application will not also be unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct committed in the parent application`
the324_patent is a continuation not a divisional of the014_patent
furthermore agfa has not suggested that the324_patent claims subject matter sufficiently distinct from its parent to preclude the trial_courts inequitable_conduct_determination
thus the trial_courts inequitable_conduct analysis properly included the324_patent

balancing
beyond the trial_courts findings of materiality and intent agfa also challenges the trial_courts inequitable_conduct_determination based on those findings
agfas argument is that notwithstanding its detailed inequitable_conduct analysis the district_court did not perform a balancing of materiality and intent
this court however has no doubt that the district_court perceived this to be a case of intentional large scale inequitable_conduct
`` the inequitable_conduct established by the evidence here was not incidental or sporadic but thoroughgoing'
decision slip op.at 49
the district_court paints a picture of a group of engineers and patent_agents who set out to design their own version of their competitors products by attending trade shows and reviewing literature all the while taking notes and holding meetings to decide which features from which printing presses would work well in agfas galileo_system
those same agents *1380 then prepared and prosecuted the asserted_patents never sharing with the pto any of the information they had compiled about the products upon which they modeled their system
the trial_court thus found high_levels of both materiality and intent and did so with respect to numerous undisclosed pieces of prior_art
in such a case the trial_court did not err by issuing its opinion without an express and detailed balancing analysis

hoffmann-la_roche inc. v. promega corp. 323_f.3d_1354_(fed.cir.2003) also supports this result
in hoffmann-la_roche this court explained the importance of determining` whether the material_misrepresentations or omissions in question are sufficiently serious in the light of the evidence of intent to deceive to warrant the severe sanction of holding the patent unenforceable'
id.at 1372
in hoffmann-la_roche this court remanded both because this court had not upheld all of the grounds for unenforceability and because the trial_court had not addressed the weight of the various findings of materiality and intent
id
in this case however this court has upheld the trial_courts findings of high_levels of both materiality and intent
with those findings firmly established in this case the district_courts less express balancing sufficed
in this setting hoffmann-la_roche does not require more

c. attorney fees
finally because this court affirms the trial_courts decision agfas argument regarding the award of attorneys fees fails
in the words of the trial_court` even among the subset ofinequitable_conduct patent cases this one must be considered exceptional'
decision slip op.at 49
this court affirms the trial_courts award of those fees

conclusion
because the trial_court properly relied on this courts gardco decision when it held a bench_trial on inequitable_conduct and because agfa has not shown that the trial_court committed any errors during that bench_trial this court affirms

costs
each party shall bear its own costs

affirmed

before newman circuit_judge dissenting
the panel_majority holds that the factual_questions of both intent to deceive and materiality of deceptively withheld information are not subject to the jury right
this is a departure from the established jury right for materiality and intent are quintessential questions of fact and have been tried to a jury throughout the nations history
there is no basis for removing these factual_questions from the jury when the jury is trier of fact
i respectfully dissent from the courts holding that there is no right to a jury and that the jury_demand can be rejected at the trial_courts discretion

the constitution the common law and precedent
the panel_majoritys holding that there is no right to a jury as to the factual_questions of material_misrepresentation and deceptive_intent is contrary to history tradition the constitution and precedent
the seventh_amendment preserves the right to jury_trial as it existed at common_law
see laurence h. tribe american constitutional law 618 3d ed.1988
the question of whether a patent was obtained *1381 upon` false_suggestion' to the granting authority that is a material_misrepresentation with deceptive_intent was tried to a jury at common_law

this debate concerning the jury right is not new to the federal_circuit as this court sought to establish consistent patent law and practice
in in re lockwood 50_f.3d_966_(fed.cir.1995) this court reviewed the history of jury_trials and fraudulent patent procurement as remedied by the common_law writ of scire_facias
see lockwood 50 f.3d at 974_n._9` the contemporary_analog of the writ is thus an action for a declaration of unenforceability due to inequitable_conduct..' which was vacated when mr. lockwood withdrew his jury_demand 515_u.s._1182 116_s.ct._29 132_l.ed.2d_911_(1995)
upon the jurys finding that patents` have been obtained surreptitiously or upon false_suggestion' the chancery court could cancel patents granted by the crown the court sitting in its` ordinary' common_law_jurisdiction rather than in its` extraordinary' equity jurisdiction
see 3 william blackstone commentaries on the laws of england 47 1765-69` the ordinary legal court is much more ancient than the court of equity
its jurisdiction is to hold plean upon a scire_facias to repeal and cancel the kings letters patent when made against law or upon untrue suggestions' ; see also e.g. a systematic arrangement of lord cokes first institute of the laws of england 328 n.d j.h
thomas ed. london s. brooke 1818 explaining the common_law_jurisdiction of the court of chancery

historically justice story recognized the common_law nature of the writ of scire_facias when he ordered a jury_trial for issues of fact in ex parte wood 22 u.s. 9 wheat
603 614-15 6_l.ed._171_(1824)` [ i ] t is the opinion of the court.. that a peremptory mandamus issue to the judge of the district court.. that he award a process in the nature of a scire_facias to the patentees to show cause why the patent should not be repealed.. and that if the issue so joined be an issue of fact then the trial thereof to be by a jury ; if an issue of law then by the court as in other cases`
issues of fraud deception and intent are traditional jury questions throughout the nations courts e.g. forsyth v. vehmeyer 177_u.s._177 180 20_s.ct._623 44_l.ed._723_(1900)` where the state court has decided that the action was for fraud and deceit and has held that in order to have maintained such action the fraud must have been proved as laid in the declaration it must be assumed that the verdict and judgment in that action were obtained only upon proof and a finding by the jury of the fact of fraud'

the panel_majority proposes that because patents were not` examined' in 18th_century_england the common_law has no relevance to fraud in patent_examination
however in england the jury would find whether a patent was fraudulently obtained as part of the proceedings of the writ of scire_facias
see rex v. arkwright kings bench 1785 raising the issues of invalidity due to anticipation and of misrepresentation
the court charged the jury gentlemen of the jury..
if the specification in any part of it be materially false or defective the patent is against law and can not be supported

i have discovered no support for the panel_majoritys version of history that in 18th_century_england` nearly every defect in a patent resulted from some false_representation made by a patentee' maj. op.at 11 but even if that is correct it *1382 reinforces rather than negates the traditional jury presence for false statements by a patentee would have been submitted to a jury in 18th_century_england

the common_law right was without quibble carried into early cases in the united_states
see e.g. grant v. raymond 31_u.s._218 240 6_pet._218 8_l.ed._376_(1832) the trial_court` instructed the jury that the patent would not be void on this ground unless such defective or imperfect specification or description arose from design and for the purpose of deceiving the public' ; delano v. scott 7 f. cas
378 382 e.d.pa.1835 trial_court charging the jury that` by the terms of that section if the specification of the patentee does not contain the whole truth relative to his discovery ; or contains more than is necessary for the purpose of deceiving the public ; or if it was not originally discovered by the patentee ; or he had surreptitiously obtained a patent for the discovery of another person judgment shall be rendered for the defendant and the patent shall be declared void'

many federal_circuit decisions illustrate the jury role in finding disputed facts concerning questions of material withholding and deceptive_intent as well as the ultimate fact of whether these infractions warrant permanent unenforceability of the patent
the panel_majoritys statement that` this court has consistently treated inequitable_conduct as an equitable_defense that may be adjudicated by the trial_court without a jury' maj. op.at 1375 is confusing if not misleading for the statement on its face is accurate but the majority then holds that there is no jury right and that the factual_issues can be adjudicated and balanced only by a judge and that there is no right to a jury when such is demanded

following are some of this courts decisions that illustrate jury adjudication upon jury_demand-negating the majoritys position that precedent requires that agfas jury_demand can be denied

cardiac pacemakers inc. v. st. jude medical inc. 381_f.3d_1371 1374 fed.cir.2004` the jury found both patents valid and rejected st. judes charge that the288_patent is unenforceable for inequitable_conduct during patent prosecution
`` ; arlington indus. inc. v. bridgeport fittings inc. 345_f.3d_1318 1325 fed.cir.2003` finally the jury found that neither gretz nor arlingtons patent attorney had committed inequitable_conduct in prosecuting the674_patent

`` ; lummus indus. inc. v. d.m
& e. corp. 862_f.2d_267 273 fed.cir.1988` in this case the jury in answer to specific interrogatories found that a nondisclosed prior_art reference considered upon reexamination of the120_patent was amoderately material reference and that the inventor and his attorneys had beengrossly negligent in failing to call it to the attention of the patent_office during original examination
accepting those findings the trial_court concluded that there was no inequitable_conduct

as the panel_majority correctly points out findings of deceptive_intent often require findings of credibility
credibility is unequivocally the province of the jury
reeves v. sanderson plumbing prods. inc. 530_u.s._133 150 120_s.ct._2097 147_l.ed.2d_105_(2000)`credibility determinations the weighing of the evidence and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions not those of a judge
`` quoting anderson v. liberty lobby inc. 477_u.s._242 255 106_s.ct._2505 91_l.ed.2d_202_(1986)
the question of whether the patent applicant intended to deceive the patent_examiner is a fact for which a jury may be demanded

the decision now offered joins a few cases in which panels of the federal_circuit diverged from history and the weight of our precedent as in gardco mfg. inc. v. herst_lighting_co. 820_f.2d_1209_(fed.cir.1987) paragon podiatry lab. inc. v. klm labs. 984_f.2d_1182 1190 fed.cir.1993 where the panel rejected the right to a jury and a few other cases
this continuing conflict within our courts precedent disserves the public as does the selective citation in this opinion of only gardco ignoring the entire body of contrary precedent and leaving litigants and *1384 trial_judges with the burdensome jousting here illustrated.1 the panel_majority misconstrues the courts holding in beacon_theatres inc. v. westover 359_u.s._500 79_s.ct._948 3_l.ed.2d_988_(1959) where the court held that factual elements in common with both legal and equitable_issues or in that case subject to equitable remedy could not be deprived of the jury right as to the factual aspects
the court made clear that when there is judicial discretion it` must wherever possible be exercised to preserve the jury_trial'
id.at 510-11 79_s.ct._948
in gardco a panel of this court found that there were no common relevant elements in the specific circumstances of that case
in contrast in the case at bar where asserted misinformation is charged with being material to patentability and deceptively withheld these are questions of fact that are directly concerned with both validity and enforceability
thus the panel_majority in its ruling that the trial_judge can always exercise discretion and refuse to try these issues to a jury misses the point that when there is a jury right as to legal elements as in beacon_theatres there is no discretion to deny the jury right as to factual_questions relevant to both the legal and equitable_issues
see also e.g. cabinet vision v. cabnetware 129_f.3d_595 600 fed.cir.1997

the ptos rule 56
concern for fraud in obtaining patent rights grew with the growth of technology as it became apparent that there was an imbalance between the information known to inventors and the knowledge of patent_examiners
see precision instrument mfg co. v. automotive maintenance machinery co. 324_u.s._806 65_s.ct._993 89_l.ed._1381_(1945)
as judicial precedent showed the need the patent_office established implementing regulations setting the obligations of patent applicants

the panel_majority further states maj. op.at 1372 that it need not follow the criteria of the ptos rule 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 as recently revised
that revision was adopted after public hearings and exploration of extensive experience as well as the needs and balance of patent_examination
that revision binds the pto and absent sound reason the administrative procedure act requires this court to follow it uniformly not selectively in different parts of the same opinion
compare maj. op.at 1372 where the court endorses the prior version of rule 56 and op.at 1377 where the court applies the present version

the claim construction issue
i comment briefly on the claim_term` stack' and its application by the majority to a vertical not a horizontal array
the panel_majority states that` when a stack is tilted more than 45 degrees it remains a stack because the plates are still arranged in a top-to-bottom_fashion
after all the top of a plate remains its top even when that plate tilts beyond 45 degrees'
op.at 1376
perhaps at 45 degrees or even 60 degrees the top of a` stack' is still a` top' but when the plates are lined up in parallel there is no longer a` top' plate for the plates are no longer` stacked'

the claims and the entire descriptive text make clear that the invention is directed to` substantially horizontal' plates that are stacked one upon the other
*1385 when the plates stand vertically-as in the prior_art and apparently in the accused system there is no top plate
i can not agree with the panel_majority that` stack' is correctly construed to include the vertical alignment of the prior_art

even if` fraud' was perfectly synonymous with the grounds for voiding an eighteenth century patent it is not the equivalent of todays inequitable_conduct_defense
common law fraud is not synonymous with the broader_concept of inequitable_conduct
see nobelpharma ab v. implant innovations inc. 141_f.3d_1059 1069 fed.cir.1998
fraud has a number of indispensable elements 1 a representation of a material_fact 2 the falsity of that representation 3 the intent to deceive or an equivalent recklessness 4 justifiable reliance by the deceived_party and 5 injury to the deceived_party
norton v. curtiss 57_c.c.p.a._1384 433_f.2d_779 792-93 1970
as noted above intent was not relevant to the decision to void a patent in eighteenth century england but rather the more standard doctrines of patentability applied
by the same token reliance and injury are not elements of todays inequitable_conduct_defense
thus while the label` fraud' may loosely cover both scenarios they are nevertheless distinct
