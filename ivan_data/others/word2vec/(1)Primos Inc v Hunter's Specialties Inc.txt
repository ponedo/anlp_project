lourie circuit_judge
hunters specialties inc. and david_forbes collectively` hunters specialties' appeal from the judgment of the united_states_district_court for the northern_district of iowa of literal_infringement willfulness and inducement of infringement as to u.s._patent 5,520,567 and infringement under the doctrine of equivalents as to u.s._patent 5,415,578
hunters specialties also appeals from the courts decision denying a motion for a new_trial
primos inc. v. hunters specialties inc. no
c01-004 n.d.iowa sept._9,_2004` final judgment`
because we affirm the district_courts claim construction of the term` engaging' we also affirm the courts judgment of literal_infringement of the567_patent
because we conclude that the application of the doctrine of equivalents was proper we affirm the courts judgment of infringement of the578_patent under the doctrine of equivalents
because the court did not abuse its discretion in excluding evidence and the courts adverse-inference_jury_instruction did not constitute prejudicial_error we affirm the courts decision denying a new_trial on those issues

background
this appeal involves the578_patent and its continuation the567_patent which are assigned to primos inc.` primos' and entitled` game call apparatus'
the patents disclose a diaphragm_mouth_call that hunters use to simulate animal_sounds
figure 1 shown below is an embodiment of the invention

?
as depicted in that figure the diaphragm_mouth_call 10 consists of a frame 18 a membrane 22 that vibrates to produce sound a flexible peripheral edge 12 *844 and a shelf or plate 15 extending above the membrane
the diaphragm_mouth_call is placed completely within the users mouth with the free-end of the membrane positioned near the opening of the mouth
'578_patent col._2,_ll._62-64
the user holds the diaphragm in place with his or her tongue while forcing air to travel through a gap between the tongue and the membrane
the air causes the membrane to vibrate and to emit a sound that replicates a particular animal
id.at col._1,_ll._31-38
the sound produced by the call is affected by the tongue pressure applied to the membrane and the distance between the membrane and the roof of the mouth
id.at col._1,_ll._38-40
the patented diaphragm_mouth_call claims an improvement over prior mouth call devices in that the shelf or plate provides a constant distance above the membrane and resists upward pressure by the tongue
id.at col._2,_ll._15-26

relevant to this appeal are claim 2 of the578_patent and claim 21 of the567_patent
claim 2 of the578_patent reads as follows a game call apparatus to be completely inserted inside a persons mouth for calling game comprising a frame ; a membrane of material stretched over the frame ; a flexible and moldable peripheral edge extending outwardly from the frame ; and
a plate having a length the plate extending generally upward from the frame and over a portion of the membrane the plate being differentially spaced above the portion of the membrane at various locations along the length of the plate
'578_patent col._4,_ll._45-55 emphases added
claim 21 of the567_patent reads as follows a game call for use inside a persons mouth comprising a u-shaped_frame ; a yieldable reed spanning across the u-shaped_frame ; a first roof-of-mouth engaging yieldable_sealing_portion carried by the frame ; a second_roof-of-mouth engaging portion extending upwardly from the frame the second portion being spaced away from the first portion the first and second portions defining a predetermined orientation of the u-shaped_frame insider the mouth relative to the roof of mouth
'567_patent col._6,_ll._20-32 emphases added

on january 24 2001 primos filed suit against its competitor hunters specialties alleging that hunters specialtiess accused device known as the tone_trough infringed primoss patents
the accused tone_trough is a diaphragm_mouth_call device that among other features contains a dome extending above the membrane instead of a shelf or plate as claimed in primoss patents
primos subsequently amended its complaint alleging that individual defendant david_forbes induced infringement of its patents.1

primos initially moved for summary_judgment of literal_infringement and for a preliminary injunction against hunters specialties
hunters specialties filed several cross-motions including for summary_judgment of noninfringement both literally *845 and under the doctrine of equivalents
on july_24,_2002 the court denied all the motions filed by both parties
in its decision the court construed the term` plate' in claim 2 of the578_patent to mean` a structural element of relatively uniform_thickness and flatness which may also have some moderate_curvature to it'
primos v. hunters specialties no
c01-004 mjm n.d.iowa july_24,_2002` summary judgment order`
relying on that construction of the term` plate' the court found that` reasonable minds could differ as to the presence or absence of aplate in the tone_trough' and thus denied all summary_judgment_motions relating to infringement of the578_patent
id
regarding claim 21 of the567_patent the court noted that while the term` second-roof-of-mouth engaging portion' is not in dispute it stated that` it is clear that this language requires that a portion of the claimed device.. come into contact with the roof of the users mouth while in use'
id. slip op.at 43
the court then determined that there were genuine issues of material fact relating to whether the tone_trough_device operates when touching the roof of a users mouth and therefore denied the summary_judgment_motions relating to infringement of the567_patent

hunters specialties then requested a markman hearing to interpret the term` engaging' in claim 21 of the567_patent
on march_15,_2004 the court construed that term to mean to` come into contact with'
primos v. hunters specialties no
c01-004 2004_wl_3323188_(n.d.iowa_mar._15,_2004)` claim construction order`
the court rejected hunters specialties construction of the term` engaging' as` interlocking' noting that while the word` interlocking' as defined in a standard dictionary may be appropriate in the context of a transmission or a latch it is not appropriate in the context of the roof of ones mouth
the court also observed that the specification of the567_patent did not support a construction of` engaging' to mean` interlocking' because the figures in the patent did not provide any means with which the diaphragm_mouth_call could interlock in the roof of a mouth
according to the court it had previously interpreted` engaging' to mean` to come into contact with' and it saw no reason to modify that construction

hunters specialties again moved for summary_judgment asserting that prosecution_history_estoppel barred the application of the doctrine of equivalents as to the578_patent in light of our intervening decision in festo corp. v. shoketsu kinzoku kogyo kabushiki co. ltd. 344_f.3d_1359_(fed.cir.2003)
the court determined that the term` plate' was amended during prosecution by describing it as` having a length' but that that amendment did not narrow the scope of the claim because` all physical objects have a length'
primos v. hunters specialties no
c01-004 mjm n.d.iowa_mar._12,_2004` prosecution history estoppel order`
the court also observed that the term` plate' was amended to require that it be` differentially spaced' above the membrane which narrowed the scope of the claim
id
according to the court the subject_matter surrendered by that amendment involved` objects that are not differentially spaced above the membrane'
because the tone_trough contained a dome that was spaced above the membrane and therefore arguably did not fall within that surrendered area the court denied summary_judgment of no infringement under the doctrine of equivalents as to the578_patent

finally before trial primos filed a motion requesting that a device known as the aluminum_flap_call not be introduced as evidence during trial
the court granted that motion and noted in its order that *846 throughout discovery hunters specialties never identified the aluminum_flap_call as invalidating prior_art
primos v. hunters specialties no
c01-004 mjm n.d.iowa_mar._12,_2004` aluminum_flap_call order`
hunters specialties had sought to introduce the aluminum_flap_call_device when it claimed it had found the device which was approximately three months prior to trial and several months after discovery had closed
however hunters specialties failed to offer any explanation why it could not locate the aluminum_flap_call during discovery
in light of those circumstances the court determined that allowing the aluminum_flap_call to be introduced as evidence during trial would result in unfair surprise to primos and thus the court granted primoss motion to exclude the aluminum_flap_call as evidence

a jury trial commenced on march_15,_2004
in the jury_instructions concerning inducement of infringement against individual defendants wayne_carlton and david_forbes the court instructed the jury that it could consider several factors and stated that` the assertion of the attorney-client_privilege with respect to a non-infringement opinion may support an inference that the withheld advice of counsel was adverse to that party'
as for willful_infringement against hunters specialties the court did not instruct the jury as to an adverse_inference but rather stated that the jury must consider the` totality of the circumstances'
after a three-and-a-half week trial the jury found that hunters specialties tone_trough_device literally infringed the567_patent and infringed the578_patent under the doctrine of equivalents
the jury also found that hunters specialties willfully infringed the567_patent and that david_forbes and wayne_carlton induced infringement of that patent

hunters specialties and wayne_carlton moved for judgment as a matter of law` jmol' arguing that the court improperly construed the term` engaging' in claim 21 of the567_patent and that the` all limitations rule' and prosecution_history_estoppel barred the application of the doctrine of equivalents as to the578_patent
those defendants also moved for a new_trial arguing that the court erred in excluding the aluminum_flap_call as evidence and that the courts adverse-inference_instruction resulted in prejudicial_error
the court denied the motion for jmol and the motion for a new_trial
primos v. hunters specialties no
c01-004 n.d.iowa mar._31,_2005
(` post-trial order`
in its decision the court first reaffirmed its construction of the claim_term` engaging' in claim 21 of the567_patent noting that it had addressed the same issue in previous decisions
the court next determined that the` all limitations rule' did not preclude the application of the doctrine of equivalents for the578_patent reasoning that the only disputed term was` plate' in claim 2 and that determining that a dome was equivalent to a plate did not vitiate that claim_limitation
the court also held that prosecution_history_estoppel did not prevent the application of the doctrine of equivalents as to the578_patent because the tone_trough did not fall within the area surrendered during prosecution
in addition the court denied hunters specialtiess motion for a new_trial reaffirming its prior decision that the aluminum_flap_call_device could not be introduced as invalidating prior_art because it was produced after the period for discovery had closed
although the court determined that its` adverse_inference' instruction to the jury was not in error the court later vacated judgment against wayne_carlton the only_defendant who had asserted the attorney-client_privilege in light of our decision in knorr- *847 bremse systeme fuer nutzfahrzeuge gmbh v. dana corp. 383_f.3d_1337_(fed.cir.2004) en banc

hunters specialties timely appealed to this court and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

discussion
we review a district_courts denial of a motion for jmol de novo by reapplying the jmol standard
markman v. westview instruments inc. 52_f.3d_967 975 fed.cir.1995 en banc
we also review the legal standards that the jury applied in reaching its verdict to determine whether they were correct as a matter of law
id.at 975
jmol is appropriate when` there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue'
fed.r.civ.p
50 a 1
the denial of a motion for a new_trial is an issue not unique to patent law ; thus we apply the law of the regional circuit in which the district_court sits-in this case the eighth_circuit
in the eighth_circuit the decision to deny a motion for a new_trial is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard

i
claim construction
the question of literal_infringement of claim 21 of the567_patent turns entirely on the district_courts construction of the term` engaging'
claim construction is a question of law reviewed de novo
cybor corp. v. fas techs. inc. 138_f.3d_1448 1454-56 fed.cir.1998 en banc
hunters specialties argues that the court erred in construing the term` engaging' in the phrase` second_roof-of-mouth engaging yieldable_sealing_portion' to mean` to come into contact with'
according to hunters specialties the proper construction of the term` engaging' is` sealing' or` interlocking'
as support for its construction hunters specialties notes that claim 21 uses the word` engaging' to describe a seal created between the edge of the frame and the roof of the users mouth
also hunters specialties observes that the specification describes the edge as` sealing' against the roof of a mouth
in addition hunters specialties finds support for its construction in a dictionary definition that describes` engaging' as` to come together and interlock'
hunters specialties points out that this definition is consistent with the way the term is used throughout the patent

primos responds that the district_court correctly construed` engaging' as` to come into contact with'
according to primos the intrinsic_evidence does not support the selective dictionary definition put forth by hunters specialties
in particular the claims use both terms` engaging' and` sealing' and thus each term is presumed to have a distinct meaning
also primos asserts that to construe` engaging' as` sealing' or` interlocking' would exclude a preferred_embodiment of the patent because the figures in the patent show the membrane as not interlocking with the roof of a mouth
in addition primos observes that while` interlocking' might be an appropriate construction of` engaging' for an invention relating to mechanical machinery with gears it is not appropriate in the context of diaphragm_mouth_calls

we agree with primos that the district_court correctly construed the term` engaging' to mean` to come into contact with'
as this court explained in phillips v. awh corp. we ordinarily construe claim_terms to have their customary_meaning as understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art
415_f.3d_1303 1312-17 fed.cir.2005 en banc
in ascertaining the ordinary and customary_meaning of a claim_term a courts primary focus should be on *848 the intrinsic_evidence of record viz. the claims the specification and if in evidence the prosecution_history
id
starting with the language of claim 21 the terms` engaging' and` sealing' are both expressly recited in the claim and therefore` engaging' can not mean the same thing as` sealing' ; if it did one of the terms would be superfluous

turning to the specification although the word` engaging' is not expressly mentioned in the specification figures 1_and_3 aid our understanding of that term
figure 3 as depicted below shows a call device positioned in a users mouth

?
as shown in the figure above there are several points of contact between the roof of a users mouth the top striped structure in the figure above and the diaphragm_mouth_call-one such point is with the plate 24 and another is with the peripheral edge of the frame 12
that figure shows the plate touching the roof of the mouth but does not reveal an interlocking_relationship because there is no depicted means from which the frame can` interlock' with the roof of a users mouth
the figure therefore supports a construction of` engaging' as to` come into contact with' while discouraging a construction of` interlocking'
while we are mindful that we can not import limitations from the preferred_embodiments into the claim we also should not normally interpret a claim_term to exclude a preferred_embodiment
see burke inc. v. bruno indep
living aids inc. 183_f.3d_1334 1341 fed.cir.1999
interpreting` engaging' to mean` interlocking' would exclude the embodiment shown in the figure and is not consistent with the rest of the specification which does not suggest an interlocking_relationship between the roof of a mouth and the mouth call.2 we therefore agree that the district_courts construction of the term` engaging' to mean` to come into contact with' is supported by the intrinsic record and is correct

ii
doctrine of equivalents
hunters specialties challenges the application of the doctrine of equivalents on the ground that prosecution_history_estoppel applies to the term` plate'
hunters specialties specifically asserts that amendments to the term` plate' narrowed the scope of the claim and were *849 made for reasons relating to patentability
according to hunters specialties prosecution_history_estoppel therefore barred the doctrine of equivalents for that claim_term
primos responds that the district_court properly applied the doctrine of equivalents
it reasons that the first amendment made to the term` plate' -that it include a` length' -did not narrow the scope of the claim
as to the second amendment made to the term` plate' -that it be` differentially spaced' above the membrane-that amendment bears no more than a tangential relationship to the accused tone_trough
in particular primos contends that the territory surrendered by that amendment consists of objects that are not differentially spaced above the membrane
because the accused devices` dome' is differentially spaced above the membrane primos asserts that the` differentially spaced' amendment does not pertain to the disputed element in the accused device and it is therefore merely tangential to the accused device
according to primos prosecution_history_estoppel thus does not apply to prevent the application of the doctrine of equivalents here

we agree with primos that the district_court correctly determined that prosecution_history_estoppel does not apply here to preclude the application of the doctrine of equivalents
as the supreme court explained in festo when a patent_claim is amended during prosecution for reasons relating to patentability there is a presumption that the patentee surrendered all the territory between the original claim_limitation and the amended claim_limitation
535 u.s. at 740 122_s.ct._1831
there are situations however in which a patentee may overcome that presumption
id
one such situation is when the` rationale underlying the amendment may bear no more than a tangential relation to the equivalent in question'
id.at 740-41 122_s.ct._1831

the term` plate' in claim 2 of the578_patent was amended in two ways 1 by requiring that it have a` length' and 2 by adding the limitation that the plate be` differentially spaced' above the membrane
the district_court correctly recognized that the addition of the term` length' did not narrow the scope of the claim because every physical object has a length
the district_court also determined that adding the limitation that the plate be` differentially spaced' above the membrane did narrow the scope of the claim and the court assumed that the reason for the amendment was a substantial one relating to patentability
we agree with the district_court however that the territory surrendered by the` differentially spaced' amendment comprises plates that are not differentially spaced above the membrane
that conclusion is consistent with the prosecution_history
the patentee added the` differentially spaced' limitation to distinguish the diaphragm_mouth_call from a prior_art_device that consisted of a shelf-like structure positioned on top of the membrane without any spacing
the accused device however includes a dome that is spaced above the membrane
because the accused devices dome includes the spacing the amendment was merely tangential to the contested element in the accused device and thus prosecution_history_estoppel does not apply to prevent the application of the doctrine of equivalents

hunters specialties also argues that the court should not have allowed the application of the doctrine of equivalents because by doing so the claim_limitation` plate' in claim 2 of the578_patent was vitiated
according to hunters specialties the courts construction of the term` plate' requires a specific structure` of relatively uniform_thickness and flatness which may also have some moderate_curvature *850 to it'
hunters specialties asserts that allowing a` dome' to be considered an equivalent to a` plate' would eliminate that limitation from the claim
primos responds that the` all limitations rule' is not applicable to the circumstances in this case
according to primos the term` plate' does not convey a definitive geometric shape or structure and thus that claim_limitation was not vitiated
primos asserts that the district_court properly allowed the jury to consider whether a` dome' was equivalent to a` plate' and that in doing so no claim_limitation was eliminated

we agree with primos that the application of the doctrine of equivalents was not improper in this case
under the doctrine of equivalents` a product or process that does not literally infringe upon [ sic ] the express terms of a patent_claim may nonetheless be found to infringe if there isequivalence between the elements of the accused product or process and the claimed elements [ sic ] of the patented invention'
warner-jenkinson co. inc. v. hilton davis chem co. 520_u.s._17 21 117_s.ct._1040 137_l.ed.2d_146_(1997) citation omitted
the` all limitations rule' restricts the doctrine of equivalents by preventing its application when doing so would vitiate a claim_limitation
warner-jenkinson 520 u.s. at 29 117_s.ct._1040 stating that the doctrine of equivalents can not be applied broadly so as to` effectively eliminate that [ claim ] element in its entirety' ; lockheed martin corp. 324 f.3d at 1321` [ i ] f a court determines that a finding of infringement under the doctrine of equivalentswould entirely vitiate a particular claim element then the court should rule that there is no infringement under the doctrine of equivalents'
( citation omitted

on appeal hunters specialties argues that we should reverse the jurys finding of equivalence because the substitution of the accused dome for the claimed` plate' would vitiate the` plate' limitation and thereby violate the all limitations rule
as the district_court recognized hunters specialties is essentially contending that there can be no equivalent to the claimed` plate'
our precedent has recognized that` [ t ] here is no set formula for determining whether a finding of equivalence would vitiate a claim_limitation and thereby violate the all limitations rule
rather courts must consider the totality of the circumstances of each case and determine whether the alleged equivalent can be fairly characterized as an insubstantial change from the claimed subject_matter without rendering the pertinent limitation meaningless'
freedman seating co. v. am
seating co. 420_f.3d_1350 1359 fed.cir.2005 citations omitted
thus because primoss theory of equivalence i.e. that a dome is equivalent to the claimed` plate' does not` effectively eliminate.. [ theplate limitation ] in its entirety' it does not violate the all limitations rule
noting that hunters specialties has not challenged whether the jurys finding is supported by substantial evidence we affirm the jurys finding that the accused dome is equivalent to the claimed` plate'

iii
exclusion of evidence
hunters specialties next argues that the district_court abused its discretion in excluding a prior_art_device the aluminum_flap_call from evidence because admitting it would have resulted in prejudicial_surprise
according to hunters specialties even though the device itself was not located until shortly before trial began primos was aware of it as being potential_prior_art throughout discovery
for example hunters specialties asserts that defendant wayne_carlton was extensively questioned by primos on *851 the aluminum_flap_call_device
hunters specialties also asserts that primos waited until shortly before the commencement of trial to claim prejudicial_surprise even though it knew about the device much earlier
in addition hunters specialties argues that there is a strong public policy in favor of allowing the aluminum_flap_call as evidence because the public interest requires consideration of any invalidating_prior_art_device

primos responds that the district_court properly excluded the aluminum_flap_call because hunters specialties never identified that device as potentially invalidating prior_art during discovery
in addition primos asserts that the defendants did not provide an explanation as to why they could not locate that device during discovery
according to primos to permit the aluminum_flap_call to be introduced as evidence during trial after years of discovery during which that device was not identified would result in prejudicial_surprise
also although the aluminum_flap_call may have been mentioned during discovery its origin could not be authenticated and the testimony revealed that the prototypes were experimental in nature
thus there was no reason for primos to believe that the aluminum_flap_call was prior_art and would be introduced as evidence

we agree with primos that the district_court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the aluminum_flap_call from evidence
the record reflects that the aluminum_flap_call was not located until after discovery had closed
moreover although the aluminum_flap_call may have been mentioned during discovery it was never identified to the court as an invalidating_prior_art_device
the district_court prevented hunters specialties from introducing the aluminum_flap_call into evidence because it` did not demonstrate diligence in attempting to locate the call during discovery' and because during discovery hunters specialties did not assert that it was claiming the aluminum_flap_call as invalidating prior_art
that determination was not an abuse of discretion
it was well within the district_courts province to determine that because the aluminum_flap_call was not identified as potential_prior_art until after discovery had closed and shortly before trial commenced it would then be unfair to permit its introduction into evidence

we reject hunters specialties argument that policy concerns should override the district_courts decision to exclude the aluminum_flap_call as evidence
first and most importantly the court never determined whether the aluminum_flap_call was in fact invalidating prior_art and the parties dispute whether the device was in public use-it was asserted that its use was experimental and occurred only in canada
thus the aluminum_flap_call may in fact not have been invalidating prior_art at all
second as the district_court pointed out the purpose of discovery is to enable parties to obtain the factual information needed to prepare their cases for trial
the district_court must therefore consider the` unfair and prejudicial_surprise' to a party that may result from allowing evidence to be presented during trial
see atd corp. v. lydall inc. 159_f.3d_534 551 fed.cir.1998 stating that the purpose of both the federal rules of civil procedure and 35 u.s.c.¡± 282 is to prevent unfair and prejudicial_surprise and not to permit last-minute production of evidence
the district_court determined that hunters specialties had ample opportunity to introduce the aluminum_flap_call during the two and a half year discovery phase
because it did not do so the district_court was entitled to decide that hunters specialties may not then introduce disputed evidence beyond the time allotted for discovery

*852 iv
adverse-inference jury instruction
finally hunters specialties asserts that under knorr-bremse 383 f.3d at 1337 the district_court erred in instructing the jury that it could draw an adverse-inference from an opinion withheld due to the assertion of the attorney-client_privilege
although hunters specialties recognizes that the only_defendant to assert the attorney-client_privilege was wayne_carlton it argues that the adverse-inference_jury_instruction prejudiced all defendants because the infringement claim involved all defendants and was tried to one jury
primos responds that the court vacated the judgment against wayne_carlton the only_individual who asserted the attorney-client_privilege and therefore the only person who was potentially prejudiced by the jury_instruction
primos points out that hunters specialties waived the attorney-client_privilege and thus was not affected by the adverse jury_instruction
in addition primos contends that hunters specialties did not present any evidence on how it was prejudiced by the jurys instruction

we agree with primos that the jury_instruction did not prejudice hunters specialties
a party seeking to alter a judgment based on erroneous jury_instructions must establish that` those instructions were legally erroneous' and that` the errors had prejudicial effect'
advanced display sys. inc. v. kent state univ. 212_f.3d_1272 1281 fed.cir.2000
legal error in an erroneous jury_instruction is prejudicial when it is` inconsistent with substantial justice'
fed.r.civ.p
61
the jurys instruction for inducement of infringement against individual defendants david_forbes and wayne_carlton provided that` the assertion of the attorney-client_privilege with respect to a non-infringement opinion may support an inference that the withheld advice of counsel was adverse to that party'
that jury_instruction thus permitted an adverse_inference to be drawn against the party that asserted the attorney-client_privilege
the only_individual who asserted the attorney-client_privilege however was wayne_carlton and the court vacated the judgment of inducement of infringement against him
the only_individual therefore potentially prejudiced by the adverse-inference_instruction was wayne_carlton not hunters specialties
in addition in the jurys instruction as to willful_infringement against individual defendant hunters specialties the express adverse_inference language was absent
rather the instruction stated that the jury must consider the totality of the circumstances and may rely on a number of factors to support a finding of willfulness
there was therefore no adverse-inference_instruction as to willfulness against hunters specialties
thus we conclude that the jurys instruction was not legally erroneous and did not result in prejudicial_error against either individual defendants hunters specialties or david_forbes

we have considered hunters specialties other arguments and find them to be unpersuasive

conclusion
because the court properly construed the term` engaging' we affirm the courts judgment of literal_infringement
because the claim_term` plate' is a structure that was not vitiated by substitution of a dome we affirm the courts conclusion that applying the doctrine of equivalents was not improper
also because the amendment was merely tangential to the contested element in the accused device we affirm *853 the courts determination that prosecution_history_estoppel did not preclude the application of the doctrine of equivalents
finally because the court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the aluminum_flap_call as evidence and because its adverse-inference_instruction did not constitute prejudicial_error we affirm the courts decision denying a new_trial

the amended complaint also included allegations against individuals carman forbes and wayne_carlton for inducing infringement
the court dismissed carman forbes from the case prior to trial and it ultimately vacated judgment against wayne_carlton
thus only david_forbes and hunters specialties remain as parties to this appeal

we do not discuss the prosecution_history here because it is not relevant to the construction of the term` engaging'
