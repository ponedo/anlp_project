background
the invention of the745_patent is an improved heat_mirror a thin transparent coating applied to glass or plastic that allows visible_light to pass through but reflects heat infrared light
such coatings are useful as window glazing materials
a heat_mirror generally comprises one or more thin layers of silver which are transparent to visible_light but reflect heat spaced apart by a layer of dielectric_material typically metal_oxide an anti-reflective non-absorbing material that decreases the reflection and increases the transmission of visible_light
two silver_layers spaced apart by a dielectric_layer form a fabry-perot_interference_filter
the heat_mirror may also include additional_layers of dielectric or other materials due to manufacturing constraints

the specification of the745_patent describes the invention as an improvement over the heat_mirror of the apfel_patent u.s._patent_no._3682,528
the apfel_patent teaches that to obtain thin optically suitable layers of silver it is necessary to first lay down a thin` nucleation' layer of nickel and then apply the silver over the nickel by vacuum deposition methods
apfel further teaches that the silver_layer may be coated with a thin layer of vapor-deposited nickel a post-coat layer to improve the durability of the heat_mirror if another layer such as a dielectric_layer is to be applied over the silver_layer
apfels nucleation and post-coat layers may be a clear dielectric_material such as titanium_oxide rather than nickel
because the nucleation and post-coat layers are time consuming and expensive to produce an objective of southwalls invention was to provide a fabry-perot filter with minimal complexity and production steps
the invention of the745_patent accomplishes this objective by` employing as the interference_filter a multilayer stack including at least two separate discrete continuous sputter-deposited transparent_metal_layers separated from one another by discrete continuous layers of dielectric'

claim 14 of the reexamined1745_patent asserted by southwall recites emphasis added2

*1574 a visually transparent infrared reflecting composite film comprising a transparent support having adhered to one surface thereof an interference_filter having a plurality of continuous directly contiguous stacked layers said layers comprising a. a dielectric_layer b
[ a ] discrete_sputter-deposited transparent_metal_layer c. one or more pairs of layers each pair comprising a dielectric spacer layer and a discrete_sputter-deposited transparent_metal_layer and
d. a dielectric outer layer wherein the dielectric is a sputter-deposited dielectric ; the metal_layers each comprise silver and each are from 4_to_17 nm in thickness and the dielectric_layers each have an index of refraction of from about 1.75 to about 2.25 with the spacer layers having a thickness of from 70_to_100 nm and outer layers having a thickness of from about 30 nm to about 70 nm
in other_words claim 14 recites a support such as glass or plastic which is coated with` continuous directly contiguous stacked layers' of sputter-deposited3 dielectric silver sputter-deposited dielectric silver and finally sputter-deposited dielectric_material
the745 specification defines` directly contiguous' as having` its usual meaning of being in actual contact i.e. of being adjoining'
when the examiner nevertheless questioned the meaning of` directly contiguous' in a july_5,_1988 office_action southwall replied the term` directly' as used in the claims is intended to mean that the layers are present or laid down contiguous with one another without intervening layers
in other_words no nucleation layers are present between two` directly contiguous' layers or between layers which are laid down` directly' on one another
in accordance with southwalls own definition unlike the interference_filter disclosed in the apfel_patent the interference_filter recited in claim 14 can have no additional_layers between the silver and the sputter-deposited dielectric_layers not even nucleation or sacrificial barrier layers
cardinals loe2 product consists of the following layers on a glass support zinc_oxide a dielectric silver titanium_oxide a dielectric zinc_oxide silver titanium_oxide zinc_oxide titanium_dioxide and a final zinc_oxide_layer
the titanium_oxide_layer is formed by a two-step_process in which titanium_metal is first sputtered in a nonreactive argon atmosphere to form a layer of titanium_metal covering the silver_layer
the zinc_oxide_layer is formed by a reactive sputtering process involving the sputtering of zinc_metal in an oxygen_atmosphere
sputtered zinc_metal reacts with the oxygen to form zinc_oxide which is deposited directly onto the surface
during this process the layer of titanium_metal already there is converted to titanium_oxide by the action of oxygen.4 the titanium_metal_layer acts as a` sacrificial barrier layer' by protecting the silver_layer from oxidation during formation of the zinc_oxide dielectric_layer.5 for purposes of summary_judgment analysis we assume it is completely converted to titanium_oxide during this step
in sum cardinals zinc_oxide_layer is formed by a one-step_reactive_sputtering_process in which zinc_oxide is directly deposited whereas its titanium_oxide_layer is formed by a two-step_process wherein the first step requires deposition of titanium_metal and the second_step requires oxidation of titanium_metal to create titanium_oxide

southwall filed the present suit on january 14 1992 alleging that cardinals loe 2 heat_mirror infringes the745_patent
cardinal moved for summary_judgment on the grounds that 1 its product does not infringe the745_patent 2 the745_patent is invalid *1575 for failure to state the best mode of the invention and 3 the745_patent is invalid as either anticipated by or obvious in light of the prior_art
the district_court granted cardinals summary_judgment motion on the first ground but denied it on the other two
southwall appeals the ruling that cardinal does not infringe the745_patent either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents

we have jurisdiction over this patent infringement action pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 1988

i. literal infringement
a literal_infringement analysis requires two separate steps
first the asserted_claims must be interpreted by the court as a matter of law to determine their meaning and scope

indus. inc. 888_f.2d_815 818 12_uspq2d_1508 1511 fed.cir.1989
in the second_step the trier of fact determines whether the claims as thus construed read on the accused product

to establish literal_infringement every limitation set forth in a claim must be found in an accused product exactly

the parties agree that a genuine_issue of fact as to whether cardinals product literally infringes the745_patent exists only if cardinals titanium_oxide and zinc_oxide_layers together form` a sputter-deposited dielectric' layer
because cardinal does not dispute that the zinc_oxide is` a sputter-deposited dielectric' the key issue here becomes whether the titanium_oxide covering the silver can also be described as` sputter-deposited' as that phrase is used in claim 14 and elsewhere defined in the745_patent
if cardinals titanium_oxide_layer which is` directly contiguous' with the silver_layer is not` sputter-deposited' the cardinal product lacks the limitation of claim 14 that the dielectric_layer` directly contiguous' with the silver_layer be` sputter-deposited' and cardinals product can not literally infringe the745_patent

a
the district courts claim construction
the district_court looked to the prosecution_history of the745_patent to interpret the claim_term` sputter-deposited dielectric'
the district_court concluded the prosecution_history requires that a` sputter-deposited dielectric' be formed by a one-step_reactive_sputtering_process and specifically not by a two-step_process in which a metal_layer is first deposited and then later oxidized.6 because cardinals titanium_oxide_layer is formed by a two-step_process in which the titanium is first deposited as a metal_layer *1576 and then later oxidized the district_court concluded cardinals titanium_oxide_layer could not be a` sputter-deposited dielectric'
because cardinals product does not have a` sputter-deposited dielectric' layer` directly contiguous' with the silver_layer the district_court further held that as a matter of law cardinals product could not literally infringe the745_patent

we agree with this analysis
arguments and amendments made during the prosecution of a patent_application and other aspects of the prosecution_history as well as the specification and other_claims must be examined to determine the meaning of terms in the claims

in the office_action dated july_5,_1988 the examiner made only one rejection based on prior_art rejecting all the pending claims as anticipated by or alternatively as obvious in view of franz u.s._patent_no._3846,152 franz teaches employing alternate layers of metal/metal_oxide to a transparent substrate such as glass or plastic and the use of a protective layer to make a transparent heat reflecting window..
the metal_layer is sputter deposited and the metal_oxide_layer is sputter deposited as a metal and then oxidized see col. 4 lines 25-28
it is unclear whether the` metal_oxide is sputter-deposited' limitation is meant to encompass the situation where the metal_oxide is [ s ] putter deposited as a metal and later oxidized
until clarification the examiner most [ sic must ] interpret the claims broadly

in response southwall amended an independent_claim to describe the dielectric as a` sputter-deposited inorganic_metal_oxide compound or salt
`` 7 southwall explained the amendment

it is believed that the claims as last presented distinguished patentably over the franz and yatabe disclosure [ s ] but to provide yet additional clear bases for distinction the claims have been amended to specify that the dielectric_layer is laid down as a sputter-deposited inorganic_metal_oxide compound or salt [ ]
as pointed out in the specification such layers can be laid down directly by reactive_sputtering_processes in which the metal is sputtered off of a metal_target and directly converted to the oxide compound or salt by the presence of a suitable gaseous reactant
( emphasis added
in this response southwall necessarily disclaimed the examiners interpretation of` sputter-deposited' metal_oxides as encompassing a two-step_process in which metal is first deposited as a metal and then oxidized
in contrast to the examiners interpretation in his office_action being responded to southwall explained that its sputter-deposited dielectric is laid down in a one-step_reactive_sputtering_process
thus the prosecution_history limits the interpretation of` sputter-deposited dielectric' layer to exclude any dielectric_layer formed by the two-step_process
because cardinals *1577 titanium_oxide_layer is formed in this manner it can not be a` sputter-deposited dielectric'

southwall argues however that cardinals two-step_process is an indirect method of forming a` sputter-deposited dielectric' but is still a sputter-deposition process because cardinals titanium_dioxide layer exists only by virtue of sputter-deposition
the titanium_metal is sputter-deposited and converted to the oxide during sputter-deposition of zinc_oxide
according to southwall the statement in the prosecution_history` such layers can be laid down directly' implies that the layers can also be laid down indirectly
however cardinals titanium_oxide_layer is not laid down by sputter_deposition as defined in the745_patent only the titanium_metal_layer is
the titanium_oxide is formed by treating deposited titanium_metal with oxygen
although this occurs while a different material zinc_oxide is being sputter-deposited the reason for the presence of the oxygen does not change the post-deposition oxidation process by which the titanium_oxide is formed and does not convert that process into a sputter_deposition i.e. a one-step_process

because we conclude that a` sputter-deposited dielectric' as that term is used in claim 14 can not be formed by a two-step_process in which a metal_layer is first sputter-deposited and then oxidized we can only conclude that cardinals product does not have a` sputter-deposited dielectric' layer` directly contiguous' with the silver_layer
therefore like the district_court we hold that as a matter of law_cardinals product can not literally infringe the745_patent

b. southwalls arguments
southwall argues that` sputter-deposited dielectric' must be interpreted to also include a dielectric_layer formed by the two-step deposition process oxidizing it because southwall presented evidence that persons of ordinary skill in the art construe the expression to include any dielectric that results from materials laid down by sputtering
southwalls evidence is affidavit testimony by its two experts describing cardinals titanium_oxide_layer as a` sputter-deposited dielectric'
alternatively southwall argues that any conflict between its experts and the prosecution_history as to the meaning of` sputter-deposited dielectric' creates a genuine fact issue which makes summary_judgment inappropriate

southwall imposes a contorted and incorrect analytical framework on the issues of claim_interpretation and literal_infringement when it argues 2
the uncontroverted testimony of the experts below establishes that those skilled in the art consider a dielectric_layer formed either by reactive sputter-deposition or by sputter up-oxidation [ the two-step_process ] of a sacrificial layer to constitute a` sputter-deposited dielectric'
thus the term` sputter-deposited dielectric' is literally met by the accused cardinal_structure ; 3
therefore since the claim as written literally describes the cardinal_structure the arguments made with respect to that term in the file_history must be reviewed to determine whether that expression was given a special_meaning in southwalls arguments which excludes the cardinal_structure
if the phrase was accorded a special_meaning in the file_history a determination must be made as to whether the file_history should be used merely to` interpret' the claims or whether a file_history estoppel by argument exists as to one or more of the claims
appellants brief at 35

southwalls framework fails in several respects
first the evidence offered by southwall does not establish the ordinary_meaning of` sputtered-deposited dielectric' to one skilled in the art
in his declaration dr. stephen f. meyer merely stated` it seems to me that [ cardinals ] dielectric_layer as a whole including both the titanium_dioxide [ sic oxide ] and the zinc_oxide could quite fairly be characterized as asputter-deposited dielectric'
similarly robert l. cormias declaration states` it is my opinion that thetitanium barrier layer that cardinal deposits immediately after each of the silver_layers is asputter-deposited dielectric in the loe 2 coatings as that phrase is used in the745_patent'
neither meyer nor cormia testified as to how one skilled in the art *1578 would interpret the term` sputter-deposited' when viewed in light of the claims specification and prosecution_history
this testimony provides only conclusory legal opinions as to whether cardinals titanium_oxide is a` sputter-deposited dielectric' rather than evidence of how that term is commonly used and understood in the art
see becton_dickinson & co. 922 f.2d at 797 17 uspq2d at 1100 affidavit of expert on what constitutes an` extension' in the context of the asserted_claim was only legal opinion which did not create a material_fact issue

second southwall assumes that a claim_term is only interpreted by first looking to its meaning in the art and then limiting that meaning in accordance with any relevant prosecution_history by either interpretation or prosecution_history_estoppel
the terms in a claim however are not given their ordinary_meaning to one of skill in the art when it appears from the patent and file_history that the terms were used differently by the applicant
intellicall inc. v. phonometrics inc. 952_f.2d_1384 1387 21_uspq2d_1383 1386 fed.cir.1992
a patentee may not proffer an interpretation for the purposes of litigation that would alter the indisputable public record consisting of the claims the specification and the prosecution_history and treat the claims as a` nose of wax'
senmed inc. 888 f.2d at 819_n._8 12 uspq2d at 1512_n._8
in other_words evidence extrinsic to the patent and prosecution_history such as expert_testimony can not be relied on to change the meaning of the claims when that meaning is made clear by those documents

because the meaning of` sputter-deposited dielectric' as used in claim 14 is clear from the prosecution_history of the745_patent southwalls expert affidavits can not alter that meaning
even if southwall could show that` sputter-deposited dielectric' has a meaning to one skilled in the art different from the definition in the745 specification and file_history the definition in the patent_documents controls the claim_interpretation
see markman 52 f.3d at 981
thus we may not consider southwalls opinion expert_testimony as we interpret claim 14 as a matter of law
because the expert_testimony is entitled to no weight it can not create a genuine_issue of material_fact precluding summary_judgment
claim_interpretation as a question of pure law is amenable to summary_judgment and disagreement over the meaning of a term within a claim does not necessarily create a genuine_issue of material_fact
see id.at 979 ; intellicall inc. 952 f.2d at 1387 21 uspq2d at 1386
any other rule would be unfair to competitors who must be able to rely on the patent_documents themselves without consideration of expert opinion that then does not even exist in ascertaining the scope of a patentees right to exclude

third southwall seems to imply that principles of prosecution_history_estoppel are relevant in the claim construction step of a determination of literal_infringement
there is however a clear distinction between following the statements in the prosecution_history in defining a claim_term and the doctrine of prosecution_history_estoppel which limits expansion of the protection under the doctrine of equivalents when a claim has been distinguished over relevant prior_art
biodex corp. v. loredan biomedical inc. 946_f.2d_850 862 20_uspq2d_1252 1262 fed.cir.1991 cert
denied 504_u.s._980 112_s.ct._2957 119_l.ed.2d_579_(1992)
claim_interpretation in view of the prosecution_history is a preliminary step in determining literal_infringement while prosecution_history_estoppel applies as a limitation on the range of equivalents if after the claims have been properly interpreted no literal_infringement has been found
see senmed inc. 888 f.2d at 818-21 12 uspq2d at 1511-13
the limit on the range of equivalents that may be accorded a claim due to prosecution_history_estoppel is simply irrelevant to the interpretation of those claims

southwall further argues that the district_court erred by failing` to recognize that in some claim combinations the two-step_process would not be literally covered by the claims while in other claim combinations the claim may be patentable for other reasons and literally cover a two-step dielectric process'
appellants brief at 44
southwall then presents extended discussion tracing *1579 the development of claim 14 from the application through the prosecution to show that the cited arguments it made during prosecution did not apply to any earlier version of claim 14

whether claim 14 derived from any application claim discussed in the prosecution_history is irrelevant to our interpretation of claim 14 in light of that history
`` sputter-deposited dielectric' can not be interpreted differently in different_claims because claim_terms must be interpreted consistently
see fonar corp. v. johnson & johnson 821_f.2d_627 632 3_uspq2d_1109 1113 fed.cir.1987 cert
denied 484_u.s._1027 108_s.ct._751 98_l.ed.2d_764_(1988)
interpretation of a disputed claim_term requires reference not only to the specification and prosecution_history but also to other_claims
id.at 631 3 uspq2d at 1112
the fact that we must look to other_claims using the same_term when interpreting a term in an asserted_claim mandates that the term be interpreted consistently in all claims
id.at 632 3 uspq2d at 1113 examining use of term` standard' in nonasserted_claims to interpret same_term in asserted_claims
accordingly arguments made during prosecution regarding the meaning of a claim_term are relevant to the interpretation of that term in every claim of the patent absent a clear indication to the contrary

ii
infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
an accused product that does not literally infringe a claim may infringe under the doctrine of equivalents if` it performs substantially the same function in substantially the same way to obtain the same result'

only if an accused product contains specific structure which meets all limitations of an asserted_claim directed to structure at least equivalently can that product infringe under the doctrine of equivalents

the application of prosecution_history_estoppel raises a question of law which we review de novo

the issue presented by this appeal is whether because of the manner of its manufacture cardinals titanium_oxide_layer is excluded as a matter of law from the range of equivalents that can be accorded the limitation` sputter-deposited dielectric
`` 8 the district_court applied prosecution_history_estoppel in holding that the range of equivalents could not extend to cardinals dielectric_layer because` [ t ] he examiner specifically rejected any process where themetal_oxide is [ s ] putter-deposited as a metal and later oxidized
the cardinal_process is such a process'
slip op.at 20
having concluded that the range of equivalents accorded this limitation in claim 14 could not encompass cardinals titanium_oxide_layer the district_court correctly held that as a matter of law_cardinals product could not infringe the745_patent under the doctrine of equivalents

*1580 a. estoppel extends beyond the embodiments shown in franz
southwall contends that the district_court erred by limiting the range of equivalents beyond what it necessarily surrendered during prosecution to distinguish its claims over the franz_patent
according to southwall it surrendered only the embodiments shown in franz
to form metal_oxide_layers franz deposits a metal_layer and then heats the device in the presence of oxygen
however franz also teaches that the uniformity of oxidation may be enhanced by first treating the metallic surface to be oxidized with a surfactant
southwall argues that only an oxidation process including treatment with a surfactant like franzs oxidation step and not the two-step_process used by cardinal is excluded from the range of equivalents that can be accorded the term` sputter-deposited' because the pertinent prosecution arguments were made only to distinguish franz not every two-step_process
southwall asserts that there is a permissible_range of equivalents between the wet chemical oxidation process of franz and the` sputter-deposited dielectric' laid down by reactive one-step sputtering and therefore it is entitled to have the trier of fact determine whether cardinals titanium_oxide_layer falls within that permissible_range of equivalents making summary_judgment inappropriate

when a court applies the doctrine of prosecution_history_estoppel to limit the scope of equivalents` a close examination must be made as to not only what was surrendered but also the reason for such a surrender'
hi-life prods. inc. v. american nat l water-mattress corp. 842_f.2d_323 325 6_uspq2d_1132 1134 fed.cir.1988 quoting bayer aktiengesellschaft v. duphar int l research b.v. 738_f.2d_1237 1243 222_uspq_649 653 fed.cir.1984
here the surrender was quite deliberate and express
it can hardly be termed inadequate or ambiguous
moreover because the pertinent differences between the franz_process and the cardinal_process are trivial the reasons for a surrender of the subject_matter of the franz_process would necessarily include a surrender of cardinals process
both processes first involve deposition of a metal_layer followed by the heating of that layer in an oxygen_atmosphere
in addition franz teaches that the uniformity of the resulting metal_oxide film can be enhanced by treating the metal_layer with a surfactant prior to oxidation
the fact that the surfactant_treatment is taught as an optional enhancement to the franz_process necessarily contemplates that the metal_oxide can be formed without this step
consequently in distinguishing franz southwall necessarily surrendered all two-step_processes for forming the metal_oxide_layer both those with and those without the surfactant_treatment
neither does the fact that franz subjects its metal_layer to an oxygen_atmosphere in a separate step whereas cardinal subjects the titanium layer to oxygen during the subsequent step of sputter-deposition of zinc_oxide provide a meaningful distinction
the important factor is the presence of oxygen regardless of the reason for that presence

an important feature of southwalls invention is the ability to reactively sputter a dielectric_layer directly contiguous with a silver_layer without oxidizing the silver_layer
southwalls process allows formation of a dielectric_layer in one step avoiding the need for barrier layers intervening between the reactively sputtered dielectric and silver_layers to protect the silver from oxidation
such barrier layers complicated the manufacturing process and increased costs
as shown by franz a process in which a metal_layer is first deposited over a silver_layer and then oxidized was known
in distinguishing franz during prosecution southwall chose not to rely on the exact method by which franz formed his dielectric_layer over silver but specifically relied on the fact that franz showed a multistep_process for doing so whereas southwall claimed a dielectric_layer formed by a one-step_process
thus an examination of both the nature of and the reason for southwalls disclaimer of the franz_process demonstrates that southwall surrendered all` two-step' processes for forming a dielectric contiguous with silver which would include cardinals two-step_process of forming titanium_oxide regardless of the precise steps of the process

*1581 an august 18 1988 response to an office_action in which southwall distinguished franz according to the manner in which franz formed the dielectric_layer further confirms this point to further emphasize the distinctions between the present invention and the franz_reference it should be noted that franz obtains his metal_oxide_layers by depositing a metal_layer and then chemically converting it to the desired oxide
in this and the earlier cited statements southwall surrendered the cardinal_process which can be described in a manner identical with this statement
having distinguished the franz_patent on the basis that` franz obtains his metal_oxide_layers by depositing a metal_layer and then chemically converting it to the desired oxide' whereas southwall forms its dielectric_layer by` reactive_sputtering_processes in which the metal is sputtered off of a metal_target and directly converted to the oxide' southwall can not now escape cardinals reliance upon this unambiguous surrender of subject_matter
see lemelson v. general mills inc. 968_f.2d_1202 1208 23_uspq2d_1284 1289 fed.cir.1992` other players in the marketplace are entitled to rely on the record made in the patent office in determining the meaning and scope of the patent'

in addition we previously rejected the very argument made by southwall that prosecution_history_estoppel is limited only to embodiments shown in the prior_art in wang labs. inc. v. toshiba corp. 993_f.2d_858 26_uspq2d_1767_(fed.cir.1993)
wangs claims recited memory_chips mounted` in a single_row'
the accused infringers produced a device having memory_chips mounted in two rows which feature wang argued was equivalent to the` single_row' limitation
id.at 866 26 uspq2d at 1775
wang contended that the prosecution_history did not exclude a substrate having memory_chips mounted in two rows because the two row_construction did not read on the prior_art
id.at 867-68 26 uspq2d at 1775-76
however because wang limited the scope of its claims to memory_chips mounted` only in a single_row' and twice argued before the pto that its claims were distinguished over the prior_art on the basis of this limitation we held that wang surrendered the two row_construction during prosecution
id.at 868 26 uspq2d at 1776
as demonstrated by the facts in wang the limits imposed by prosecution_history_estoppel on the permissible_range of equivalents can be broader than those imposed by the prior_art
haynes int l inc. v. jessop steel co. 8_f.3d_1573 1579 28_uspq2d_1652 1657 fed.cir.1993 clarified reh g granted 15_f.3d_1076 29_uspq2d_1958_(fed.cir.1994)
such is the case here

for these reasons we hold that the prosecution_history limits the range of equivalents that can be accorded the term` sputtered-deposited dielectric' to exclude cardinals titanium_oxide_layer and therefore as a matter of law cardinal can not infringe the745_patent under the doctrine of equivalents

b
the prosecution history supports the separate estoppel regarding the manner of forming the dielectric
southwall further argues that the district_court erred by disregarding the holding of read corp. v. portec inc. 970_f.2d_816 23_uspq2d_1426_(fed.cir.1992)
southwall cites read for the proposition that separate statements made by a patentee to distinguish a prior_art_reference can never create separate_estoppels
under southwalls theory where a patent applicant sets forth multiple bases to distinguish between its invention and the cited prior_art no estoppel by argument can attach to the patent claims unless all of the bases taken together also distinguish the accused device from the asserted_claims
in other_words unless the accused device contains all the features of the prior_art used in distinguishing the asserted_claims estoppel can not apply

during prosecution southwall distinguished the franz_patent on two bases 1 that franz taught a metal_oxide_layer formed by a two-step_process rather than a one-step_process and 2 that franz taught a filter using only one metal_layer and one nonmetal_layer rather than` a filter in which two metal_layers and a dielectric_layer interact to give rise to the filtering properties' as recited in *1582 the claims.9 under southwalls interpretation of read southwall only surrendered the two-step_process of forming a dielectric when such a process is applied to a filter having a single_metal_layer
southwall argues that for cardinal to be entitled to an estoppel based on southwalls arguments distinguishing the franz_patent according to dielectric formation the other distinction over the franz_patent made during prosecution must also apply to cardinals product
therefore southwall maintains that the range of equivalents accorded` sputter-deposited dielectric' is not limited in this case unless cardinals product has like franzs device only a single_metal_layer which clearly it does not

southwalls interpretation expands read beyond its facts and rationale
indeed it inverts the holding of read
there we held multiple_arguments do not always create multiple_estoppels
southwall however argues that read holds multiple_arguments never create multiple_estoppels
the correct law as read implies is that sometimes they do sometimes they do not

reads asserted_claim was directed to a relatively simple mechanical device a portable loam screening apparatus for separating fine earth material from coarser materials
after the examiner rejected the claims under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 as obvious in view of various combinations of references read added a limitation reciting a set of wheels mounted to one of said sides [ of the apparatus_frame ] and movable relative to said frame from an operative position for transporting said apparatus to an inoperative position for resting said frame flush on the ground
id.at 819 23 uspq2d at 1429
the prosecution_history showed that the examiner found this amendment insufficient for patentability but agreed to allow the claims if further amended to include limitations indicating the relationship of the tall_end of the apparatus_frame to the payloader and where the short_end of the frames` closed' characteristics began and ended
the claim was amended to describe these characteristics10 and allowed on that basis
id. 23 uspq2d at 1429

the accused infringer portec argued that read was estopped by the prosecution_history from asserting any range of equivalents for the limitation pertaining to the retractable_wheels because read had pointed out during prosecution that some references did not have this feature
id.at 824 23 uspq2d at 1433
in rejecting portecs contention we explained every statement made by a patentee during prosecution to distinguish a prior_art_reference does not create a separate_estoppel
arguments must be viewed in context
in context read distinguished for example the deister reference because of a wealth of differences.. read pointed out differences not only respecting the wheels.. but also marked differences in other parts of the structure
thus any estoppel created by portecs [ sic reads ] argument encompasses all of these combined_distinctions of deister and not an estoppel respecting each of the individual differences e.g. that any device with non-movable wheels can not infringe
id. 23 uspq2d at 1433 emphasis in original

read does not hold as southwall asserts that arguments made during prosecution can only create an estoppel regarding the combined_distinctions and can never create separate_estoppels
rather the prosecution_history must be examined as a whole in determining whether based on a particular argument a particular estoppel applies
see *1583 texas_instruments inc. v. united_states_int l_trade_comm n 988_f.2d_1165 1173 26_uspq2d_1018 1025 fed.cir.1993
for instance any argument made regarding the need to distinguish the prior_art in read the characteristics of the frame does create a separate_estoppel regardless of other distinctions made
see vaupel textilmaschinen kg v. meccanica euro italia s.p.a. 944_f.2d_870 882 20_uspq2d_1045 1054 fed.cir.1991` the doctrine of prosecution_history_estoppel bars a patentee from enforcing its claims against otherwise legally equivalent structures if those structures were excluded by claim limitations added in order to avoid prior_art
`` citation omitted

estoppel extends beyond the basis of patentability however
clear assertions made during prosecution in support of patentability whether or not actually required to secure allowance of the claim may also create an estoppel
texas_instruments inc. 988 f.2d at 1174 26 uspq2d at 1025
in read the patentee argued for patentability based on a combination of elements including retractable_wheels because cited prior_art disclosed retractable_wheels
the patentee recognized that the wheels alone were insufficient to establish patentability
read 970 f.2d at 824 23 uspq2d at 1433
because read argued that patentability was established by its combination of known elements it created an estoppel only regarding the combined_distinctions
it is important to note moreover that we concluded that the argument created an estoppel regarding the combination even though the examiner did not allow the claims based on the combination and the associated argument
the claims were still rejected after read had added the limitation pertaining to the wheels and made the relevant arguments regarding the wheels combined with other elements
thus we must examine the character of assertions made in the prosecution_history in addition to the result of those assertions i.e. whether they result in allowance when determining whether they create an estoppel

in the instant case southwall did not argue for allowance based on the combination of a` sputter-deposited' metal_oxide_layer with an interference_filter having two metal_layers
because the franz_patent disclosed neither limitation cardinal could have reasonably assumed that either one alone could have provided the basis for patentability
therefore the rationale of read applying estoppel to only a combination is not relevant to this case
accordingly we may examine southwalls prosecution argument distinguishing its` sputter-deposited' metal_oxide from franzs separately from southwalls other_arguments distinguishing franz
when we do we conclude the separate arguments create separate_estoppels

c. the arguments made to distinguish franz limit all claims using the terms defined in those arguments
southwall argues that the arguments made during prosecution regarding the amended claim_term` sputter-deposited metal_oxide compound or salt' do not create an estoppel limiting the range of equivalents that can be accorded claim 14 because they were not made about that claim or the pertinent phrase` sputter-deposited dielectric'
according to southwall no equivalents of` sputter-deposited dielectric' were surrendered by these arguments
in southwalls view since the arguments concerning franz were never made to obtain allowance of the claims now being asserted claims 14_and_36 but instead were directed to now canceled claims in the application there is no estoppel
southwall cites no authority explicitly so holding

southwalls analysis contains several flaws
first whether the material of the layer was described as a` metal_oxide compound or salt' or as a` dielectric' was irrelevant to the arguments southwall made
they centered on its definition of` sputter-deposited' as describing a one-step_reactive_sputtering_process rather than a two-step_process
therefore we conclude that this substitution of phraseology did not affect the subject_matter surrendered by southwall in distinguishing the franz_reference

secondly as explained above the actual basis for patentability is not the only factor that determines whether an argument in the prosecution_history creates an estoppel
we *1584 look also to the context and character of the argument

and once an argument is made regarding a claim_term so as to create an estoppel the estoppel will apply to that term in other_claims
see texas_instruments inc. 988 f.2d at 1175 26 uspq2d at 1026` the prosecution_history_estoppel we hold proven on claim 12 is equally applicable to claims 14_and_17`
if the arguments made with respect to one claim limit the range of equivalents accorded a term in that claim and that term is later incorporated into another claim the range of equivalents accorded the other claim must be limited in the same_manner
competitors must be able to rely on the definition of a claim_term given in the prosecution_history even when the term is later incorporated into different_claims in order to understand what constitutes infringement
given the metamorphosis that claims often go through during prosecution it is often impossible to trace the lineage of the finally allowed claims to decide which arguments pertained to which claims
therefore that southwall might have made the arguments distinguishing franz with regard to versions of the claims not now at issue does not avoid those arguments limiting later or different versions of the claims

southwall relies on wilson sporting goods co. v. david geoffrey & assocs. 904_f.2d_677 14_uspq2d_1942_(fed.cir.) cert
denied 498_u.s._992 111_s.ct._537 112_l.ed.2d_547_(1990) for support of its argument that a term may have a different range of equivalents in different_claims
southwall misreads wilson which merely states that the range of equivalents accorded a broader independent_claim may be narrower than the range of equivalents accorded a dependent claim in order to prevent the broader claim from encroaching on prior_art which the additional limitations of the dependent claims avoid
904 f.2d at 686 14 uspq2d at 1949
wilson does not address prosecution_history
further in contrast to wilson the issue before us is not the range of equivalents which if analyzed as hypothetical claims would be patentable in light of the prior_art but what otherwise equivalent subject_matter southwall surrendered in the arguments made to the examiner

we have considered southwalls other_arguments on appeal and find them unpersuasive and separate discussion of them is unwarranted

conclusion
because as a matter of law_cardinals product does not contain a` sputter-deposited dielectric' layer` directly contiguous' with a silver_layer even equivalently the district_courts grant of summary_judgment for cardinal was not in error
in accordance with the prosecution_history we interpret` sputter-deposited dielectric' to encompass only a dielectric_layer formed by a one-step reactive sputtering technique
moreover southwall is estopped by the prosecution_history from asserting a range of equivalents for the limitation` sputter-deposited dielectric' that includes a dielectric formed by a two-step_process
because cardinals titanium_oxide_layer which is directly contiguous with its silver_layer is formed by a two-step_process the titanium_oxide is neither literally a` sputter-deposited dielectric' nor an equivalent of that limitation
as such cardinals device lacks the limitation of claim 14 requiring a` sputter-deposited dielectric'` directly contiguous' with a silver_layer and therefore as a matter of law_cardinal can not infringe the745_patent
accordingly summary_judgment of non-infringement was proper

southwall requested reexamination of the745_patent on the ground that the chang patent u.s. patent no._4179,181 presented a substantial new question of patentability
2
claim 36 of the745_patent also asserted by southwall is identical to claim 14 except that the specified thickness of the spacer layer in the last clause is different
that difference however does not affect our analysis and therefore would not justify a different result as to infringement by the accused product
3
to deposit a thin film by sputtering high energy particles are caused to collide with the surface of a material to dislodge atoms from that material which then deposit on the surface to be coated
4
the final titanium_dioxide layer in cardinals structure is produced by the same reactive sputtering two-step_process used to produce the zinc_oxide_layer
that layer however is not central to any issue in this case
5
southwall protects the silver_layer from oxidation during deposition of the dielectric without adding an additional layer by use of a process involving hydrogen gas
6
although the district_court erred in assuming that the entirety of cardinals dielectric_layer rather than only the titanium_oxide_layer was formed by a two-step_process this error did not undermine the courts analysis because claim 14 requires that the` sputter-deposited dielectric' layer be` directly contiguous' with the silver_layer
thus if the titanium_oxide_layer which is` directly contiguous' with the silver_layer can not be described as a` sputter-deposited dielectric' cardinal can not literally infringe that claim even though its zinc_oxide_layer can be described in this manner
7
earlier versions of some original745 claims had also used the narrower limitation` inorganic_metal_oxide compound or salt' rather than` dielectric' which was used later
although southwall attempts to make much of this difference it does not affect our analysis because in both instances the key phrase the meaning of which is at issue` sputter-deposited' is used in exactly the same_manner to modify the general class of dielectric_materials as the list of specific dielectric_materials
the arguments regarding the` sputter-deposited inorganic oxide compound or salt' made during prosecution are thus relevant to our interpretation of` sputter-deposited dielectric' for purposes of literal_infringement as well as to the application of prosecution_history_estoppel to limit the range of equivalents accorded that term
8
cardinal does not contest for purposes of this appeal that` but for' the titanium_oxide sacrificial barrier layer factual issues exist as to whether its product infringes claim 14 under the doctrine of equivalents
because claim 14 recites a` sputter-deposited dielectric' layer which is` directly contiguous' with a silver_layer additional_layers in cardinals product intervening between its own` sputter-deposited dielectric' and silver_layers would prevent infringement because a limitation would be entirely lacking from the accused device
southwall suggests no way in which cardinals product can satisfy the` directly contiguous' limitation even equivalently if the titanium_oxide_layer is not a` sputter-deposited dielectric'
9
southwall attempts to deconstruct this latter distinction into seven separate bases for distinguishing its invention from the franz_patent
appellants brief at 40-41
in the prosecution_history southwall provides multiple_arguments to demonstrate that franz does not teach a fabry-perot_interference_filter but these arguments support only one distinction

the asserted_claim recited the limitation as follows a frame of generally rectangular cross section and having a tall_end and a short_end joint [ sic ] by sides said short_end being closed from an upper edge of said short_end to the ground and the lower portion of said tall_end being completely open from the ground to a height sufficiently high to permit a payloader to collect the finer material from within the frame
