demarini_sports inc.` demarini' appeals from the decision of the united_states_district_court for the district of oregon granting the motion of worth inc.` worth' for summary_judgment` sj' of non-infringement of demarinis u.s._patent_no._5415,398` the ¡¬398_patent` and denying the motion of demarini for summary_judgment of infringement of claim 15 of the ¡¬ 398 patent literally and of claims 1 2 15 and 18 of the ¡¬398_patent under the doctrine of equivalents

we hold that the district_courts construction of the terms` frame' and` insert' *1318 was not erroneous
we also hold that the district_courts construction of claim 15 to require that the large-diameter_impact_portion be part of a bat_frame was not erroneous
moreover we conclude that no reasonable_jury could find infringement either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents of claims 1 2 15 or 18 of demarinis ¡¬398_patent
thus we affirm the district_courts judgment of no infringement

background
the technology of the ¡¬398_patent is high-performance double-walled aluminum softball_bats
in or around 1989 ray demarini approached michael eggiman the inventor of the ¡¬398_patent and proposed that they form a part-time business designing and selling high-performance softball_bats
prior to embarking on this project eggiman knew nothing about bat design
his expertise was in the design of leaf_springs for trucks and was gained at the suspension division of a truck manufacturing company where he worked as a full-time mechanical engineer with demarini

eggiman began his bat design efforts by studying commercially available bats
from his study eggiman concluded that one of the most important factors in bat performance was the thickness of the wall of the bat at the point of impact with a ball i.e. the impact_portion of the bat
eggiman noted that although thicker-walled_bats resisted denting and lasted longer thinner-walled_bats had better performance due to the ability of the wall of the bat to cave in and spring back-an effect commonly referred to as the` trampoline_effect'
eggimans new understanding of the importance of the trampoline_effect coupled with his knowledge of the manner in which leaf_springs are able to give and slide over one another gave him the idea of a double-walled_bat i.e. a bat in which there are two concentric tubes at least at the hitting_end of the bat

eggiman considered two approaches to the design of a double-walled_bat
the first approach was to insert one tube inside a traditional bat of the type having a relatively large_diameter_impact_portion at one end and tapering to a relatively small diameter_handle_portion at the other_end
the second_approach was to take the traditional bat structure and position a larger diameter tube ; i.e. an exterior_shell over the impact_portion of the bat
however in reducing his design to practice eggiman did not pursue the second_approach because he did not know if such a construction would be safe
more particularly he was not sure how to keep the exterior_shell securely attached over the end of the bat

the ¡¬398_patent application was filed on may_14,_1993 and finally issued on may_16,_1995

a bat designed according to the claims of the ¡¬398_patent was marketed in 1993
the claims at issue of the ¡¬398_patent read as follows 1
a bat comprising a hollow_tubular_bat_frame having a circular cross-section ; and
an insert positioned within the frame the insert having a circular cross-section the insert having first and second_ends adjoining the tubular_frame the insert being separated from the tubular_frame by a gap forming at least_part of an annular_shape along a central_portion between said first and second_ends the frame elastically deflectable across the gap to operably engage the insert along a portion of the insert between the insert first and second_ends
2
a bat according to claim 1 in which the insert is suspended within the frame and is secured thereto at said first and second_ends
15
in a hollow_bat having a small-diameter_handle_portion and a large-diameter_impact_portion an improvement comprising an internal structural *1320 insert defining an annular_gap with an inside_wall of the impact_portion of the bat and the impact_portion elastically deflectable to close a portion of the annular_gap and operably engage the insert
18
a bat comprising a hollow_tubular_bat_frame having a small-diameter_handle_portion and a large-diameter_impact_portion having a circular cross-section with an inner and outer_diameter ; at least one insert having a substantially circular cross-section with an outer_diameter less than the inner diameter of the frame_impact_portion the insert being held within the impact_portion ; and
the impact_portion being inwardly elastically deflectable such to establish a tight interference_fit between the insert and the impact_portion

the worth bat accused of infringing the foregoing claims of the ¡¬398_patent is a softball_bat known as the` est' bat
instead of an insert disposed within the impact_portion of the bat worth places an external_shell over the hitting_end of the bat
three of worths engineering drawings of the est_bat are shown below

?
during the design of the est_bat worth tested a commercial version of demarinis patented bat but was not aware of the existence of the ¡¬398_patent at that time
worth admits though that it learned about the ¡¬398_patent prior to completing its design of the est_bat
additionally in 1996 worth and demarini engaged in licensing negotiations over the ¡¬398_patent but worth was unable to obtain a license

despite the fact that worth knew of the ¡¬398_patent before finishing the est_bat_design worth contends that its est_bat_design is based on independent design concepts substantially different from those of the ¡¬398 bat
according to worth design efforts for the est_bat began prior to the *1321 issuance of the ¡¬398_patent
these efforts included research and development work done by a consultant for worth dr. speckhart during the development of the worth supercell 2 bat introduced commercially in 1995
during his work on the supercell 2 project speckhart discovered that when a ball was hit with the large_diameter_impact_portion of a conventional bat the resulting bending of the tapered_portion of the bat had a significant positive effect on hitting performance
worth refers to this bending phenomenon as the` diving_board_effect'
from this discovery worth designed the supercell 2 bat focusing on the shape and thickness of the tapered_portion of the bat

worth contends that in designing the est_bat it was primarily concerned with maximizing the diving_board_effect it had begun to develop in the supercell 2 bats
to achieve the maximum benefit of the diving_board_effect worths focus was on reducing the starting diameter of the tapered_section of the est_bat
worth knew that to be a successful bat however the est would also have to provide the maximum_diameter_impact_portion allowed by softball_rules ; i.e. 2.25 inches
according to worth with the foregoing concepts in mind the est_bat was designed to have a hollow_body that is tapered down to a handle at one end and is covered at the opposite` hitting_end' by an exterior_shell

worth specifically asserts that the diameter of the hollow_body of the est_bat was designed to be less than the maximum_diameter permitted for an impact_portion of a softball_bat so that the beginning of the tapered_section could be as small as possible to provide for the greatest amount of bat_bending
to accommodate this design and build the diameter of the impact_portion back up to the maximum_diameter allowed under the softball_rules the exterior_shell was added at the hitting_end
according to worth the est exterior_shell over the hitting_end both increases the diameter and reinforces the bat in the area where it is intended to impact a ball
because the diameter of the est body where it is tapered is smaller than in conventional aluminum bats bat_bending is increased which worth believes increases the ests slugging power

demarini filed its infringement suit against worth in the united_states_district_court for the district of oregon` the district_court' on november 28 1997 alleging that worths est_bat infringed claims 1 2 15 and 18 of demarinis ¡¬398_patent under the doctrine of equivalents
after demarini filed a motion for summary_judgment of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents and worth filed a reply thereto the district_court conducted a markman_hearing

jan._14,_1999` demarini_i'
in a january 14 1999 opinion the district_court set forth its construction of the only claim_terms then in dispute namely` gap' as used in claims 1_and_15 and` interference_fit' as used in claim 18
id.at 4-9

following demarini_i worth filed a motion for summary_judgment of non-infringement of claims 1 2 15 and 18
demarini renewed its previous summary_judgment_motion and added a contention that the est_bat also literally infringed claim 15
the district_court ruled on these motions in demarini_ii

the district_court found that worth failed to satisfy its burden of proof that claim 18 was invalid for indefiniteness and thus denied that summary_judgment_motion
demarini_ii slip op.at 5
in addressing the motions regarding infringement the district_court noted sua sponte that it needed to construe the term` large-diameter_impact_portion' as used in claim 15 which term was not in issue at the time of the markman_hearing
after construing *1322 this term the district_court concluded that the worth_est_bat neither infringed claim 15 literally nor infringed claims 1 2 15 and 18 under the doctrine of equivalents
id.at 6-14
the district_court then granted worths summary_judgment_motion of non-infringement and denied demarinis summary_judgment_motion of infringement
id.at 14

demarini timely appealed the judgment regarding infringement and worth cross-appealed the district_courts construction of the claim_terms` gap' and` interference_fit'

a. frame
as previously noted in demarini_ii the district_court before reaching the question of infringement construed the term` large-diameter_impact_portion'
demarini_ii slip op.at 6-8
the court also found it a necessity to adopt a definition of the term` frame' or` bat_frame' before reaching the issue of infringement
id.at 6_n._1
the court adopted the interpretation` that the bat_frame is the single_piece with the large_portion for hitting the ball at one end tapering to the handle with a knob at the other_end'
id

demarini contends that the district_courts construction of the claim_term` frame' was improper
specifically demarini takes issue with the district_courts construction of the term` frame' as modified by the term` bat' set forth in demarini_ii i.e.` a single_piece with a large_portion for hitting the ball at one end tapering to the handle with a knob at the other_end'
id
demarinis basic position is that a` bat_frame' is a hollow tube of the sort that covers the hitting_end of a bat i.e. an external_shell that is large enough to hold an insert and that an` insert' is a structure that incorporates both the handle and the portion of the hitting_end of the bat that goes inside the external_shell
demarini argues that this was how the term` frame' was construed in demarini_i and that the district_court improperly reinterpreted the term` frame' in demarini_ii
we do not agree that the district_court reinterpreted the term` frame' in demarini_ii
in demarini_i the term` frame' was not in dispute and the district_courts discussion of the term` frame' was simply to give context to the discussion of the disputed terms` gap' and` interference_fit' and not to set forth a binding definition
the court did not focus its attention on the structural_requirements of a bat` frame' until it came time to grapple with the issue of literal_infringement of claim 15 an issue raised by demarini only after the court released its demarini_i opinion

demarini presents five arguments as to why its proffered_definition is correct and that of the district_court in demarini_ii is erroneous
first demarini notes that the ordinary_meaning of frame is` an open *1324 structure or rim for encasing holding or bordering'
second demarini notes that an integral relationship of the handle the impact_portion and the tapered_portion of the frame is only described as a preferred_embodiment in the written description and that this written description indicates that other configurations such as separate pieces fall within the scope of the invention
third demarini contends that a handle can not be a required_part of the frame since the insert of the invention can not fit inside the handle
fourth demarini notes that in view of the discourse between the examiner and the patentee regarding u.s._patent_no._5219,164 issued to peng` peng ¡¬164' it is clear that the examiner understood that the term` frame' did not require an integral_handle
fifth and last demarini notes that in view of the fact that it never attempted to distinguish its claimed invention from the peng_¡¬164_insert which extends outside the axial_limits of the` frame' it obviously never considered that the claim_term` frame' must include an impact_portion and a handle

demarinis arguments fail to persuade us that its proffered_definition is the correct construction for the claim_term` frame' as modified by the claim_term` bat'
we address each of demarinis contentions beginning first with the argument that a handle can not be a required_part of the frame because the insert of the invention can not fit inside the handle
the district_courts definition of frame does not require the insert to fit inside the handle it merely requires that the insert be contained within some part of the frame which consists of the impact_portion the tapering_portion and the handle_portion of the bat

as we noted above interpreting claims requires a review of all of the intrinsic_evidence the claim_language the written description and the prosecution_history
the claim_language does little to elucidate what structure is described by` bat_frame' and` bat_frame' is not specifically defined in the written description
consequently we begin our construction of the term` bat_frame' by looking at the ordinary_meaning of the term` frame'
we deem it appropriate to use the dictionary definition proffered by demarini ; i.e.` an open structure or rim for encasing holding or bordering' because it is a standard dictionary definition which worth does not dispute
demarini would have us end our analysis with this definition to reach its conclusion that this term only requires that one tube be large enough to accommodate a second tube inside of it
we decline demarinis invitation
we can not look at the ordinary_meaning of the term` frame' in a vacuum
rather we must look at the ordinary_meaning in the context of the written description and the prosecution_history of the ¡¬398_patent to determine the proper construction of that term as modified by the claim_term` bat' and as used in the claims of the ¡¬398_patent

the written description of the ¡¬398_patent indicates that the invention particularly relates to the use of structural members inside of softball or baseball bats to improve their impact response
¡¬398_patent col._1,_ll._6-11
the patent discusses prior_art attempts to provide for greater impact response by constructing tubular bats using materials other than aluminum and the high cost and difficulty of working with materials such as titanium
id.at ll
49-56
the patent also discloses that prior_art_bats have been made using inserts but that most of these inserts are positioned for vibration deadening purposes
id.at ll
57-59
in addition the patent recognizes that there is at least one prior_art_bat that uses an insert in a bat to improve the` repelling action' of the bat
id at ll
59-62
but the patent further discloses that the insert of that prior_art_bat is in` tight abutment within the tubular_frame' of the bat thus merely providing a thickened *1325 wall of the impact_portion of the bat
id.at ll
60-68

after its discussion of the prior_art shortcomings the patent indicates that one of the objects of the invention is to design a new bat with a simple construction
see id. col._2,_ll._1-8
thereafter a preferred_embodiment of the invention is described
see id. col._2,_ll._9-23
that description includes a discussion of the external structure of the tubular_bat_frame namely that it has a large-diameter_impact_portion an intermediate_tapering_portion and a small-diameter_handle_portion
the description also indicates where the tubular_insert is positioned in the bat_frame and the manner in which the tubular_insert is suspended in the frame
id

the detailed_description of the invention found at col._2,_l._39 and continuing through col._5,_l._52 which describes a manner of providing for an improved impact response according to one embodiment of the invention notes as does the` preferred_embodiment' that the tubular_bat_frame has a relatively large-diameter_impact_portion an intermediate_tapering_portion and a relatively small-diameter_handle_portion
id.at col._2,_ll._39-49
this description then describes the insert and a manner of placing it within the frame to achieve an interference_fit and obtain the leaf-spring_effect and greater_slugging_capacity
id.at col._2,_l._50- col._3,_l._35
other manners of achieving an interference_fit by positive attachments of the insert are described at col._4,_ll._24-60
at col._5,_ll._33-45 the patent describes yet another embodiment of the invention in which a positive attachment of the insert to the frame may be dispensed with while still achieving the leaf-spring_effect
thus the detailed_description of the invention discusses at great length a variety of ways of placing an insert within a bat_frame to achieve greater_slugging_capacity through the leaf-spring_effect

contrary to demarinis argument the patent does not suggest a bat_frame consisting of less than a handle a tapered_portion and an impact_portion
demarini points out that the patent indicates that forming the bat_frame by swaging an integral weld-free frame is only an exemplary_manner of making the bat_frame and that` all permutations of component dimensions and configurations fall within the scope of the present invention'
id.at col._3,_l._66- col._4,_l._23
the latter remark however comes just after the statement that` many permutations of bat_frame insert and gap dimensions will work equally as well'
in other_words the` components' contemplated in the` all permutations' remark clearly refers to the insert the gap and the bat_frame as a whole-not just the handle the taper portion and the impact_portion of the bat_frame
moreover as for` swaging' only being an exemplary_manner of constructing the bat_frame this remark only indicates that there are other methods aside from swaging that can be used to make the bat_frame i.e. that the bat_frame structure need not be made in a single construction step-not that the frame does not include the handle the tapering_portion and the impact_portion

turning now to the prosecution_history we disagree with demarini that the discourse between the examiner and the patentee regarding the u.s._patent_no._5 219,164` peng_¡¬164_patent` clearly shows that the examiner understood that the term` frame' did not require an integral_handle
the peng_¡¬164_patent discloses the following with regard to its inventive bat structure 1 an elongated handle 10 with an axial cavity formed therein ; 2 a tapering tubular_stem 20 ; 3 a generally cylindrical main_body 30 with a taper section to the rear ; 4 an elastic shock and vibration absorbing end_piece 40 ; and 5 a guard_piece 50
see peng_¡¬164_patent col._1,_ll._4-10
the above-listed components are assembled together with the end_piece 40 the main_body 30 the guard_piece 50 and the handle 10 all arranged on the stem *1326 20 to form a completed bat
this shock absorbing baseball bat structure can be seen in figure 1 immediately below

?
the examiner rejected demarinis original claims 1_and_2 as being clearly anticipated by the peng_¡¬164_patent under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 e
original_claim 1 read a bat comprising a hollow_tubular_bat_frame ; and
an insert positioned within the frame the insert having first and second_ends adjoining the tubular fame the insert being separated from the tubular_frame by a gap along a central_portion between said first and second_ends

in his rejection the examiner did not make reference to any particular feature of the peng_¡¬164_bat that he considered to be the` bat_frame' or the` insert' in his rejection
it was only demarini and not the examiner who characterized the main_body 30 as a` frame' and the tapering tubular_stem 20 as an` insert'
the examiner made no comment on demarinis naming of the parts of the peng_¡¬164_bat
demarini would have us infer a meaning for the term` frame' drawn from the examiners silence rather than from its response to the examiners rejection
drawing inferences of the meaning of claim_terms from an examiners silence is not a proper basis on which to construe a patent_claim and we reject demarinis arguments predicated on such inferences

demarini also contends that because it never argued that the peng_¡¬164_insert distinguished the peng_¡¬164_patent from the claimed invention by extending outside the axial_limits of the` main_body 30' demarini never considered the claim_term` frame' to include an impact_portion and a handle
however just as we can draw no inference from what the examiner did not say we can draw no inference from what demarini did not argue
it could just as *1327 easily be presumed from demarinis silence that demarini recognized that when the` main_body 30' was connected to the handle the` insert' of the peng_¡¬164_bat did not extend beyond the` bat_frame' of the peng_¡¬164_bat just as the claimed` insert' does not extend beyond the` bat_frame'

in view of the ordinary definition of the term` frame' and the explanation of that term in conjunction with the term` bat' in the written description and intrinsic record we conclude that` frame' as modified by the term` bat' and used in claims 1_and_18 means a tubular_structure having a large-diameter_impact_portion a tapered_portion and a small-diameter_handle all of which are connected when the bat is fully constructed for its intended use
this is substantially the same definition of` bat_frame' given by the district_court in demarini_ii

to resolve the issue of literal_infringement of claim 15 the district_court found it necessary to construe the terms` large-diameter_impact_portion'
demarini_ii slip op.at 6-7
the district_court construed the claim to require that the` large-diameter_impact_portion' of the hollow_bat be a part of a bat_frame id.at 7 even though the court recognized that claim 15 does not explicitly include the term` frame'
id.at 6_n._11 the court concluded that a bat_frame was an implicit limitation of` large-diameter_impact_portion' for two reasons
first the court recognized from the prosecution_history that demarini itself had characterized the` large-diameter_impact_portion' as being part of a bat_frame when it distinguished claim 15 from all of the prior_art references` by reciting the frame_impact_portion being elastically deflectable..' emphasis added
second the district_court noted that the preamble of a jepson claim recites elements known in the prior_art and it is common in the prior_art for the impact_portion to be part of the bat_frame
id.at 6-7

demarini contends that it was improper for the district_court to interpret` impact_portion' of claim 15 to include a` frame' limitation because the term` frame' is not used in that claim
demarini further argues that the language of claim 15 does not require the impact_portion to be integrally connected to the handle and the language of the claim does not preclude the` internal_structural_insert' from being integrally connected to the handle
demarini also argues that in the specification the` impact_portion' is defined as ending where the tapering_portion begins

in addition according to demarini it was improper for the district_court to read` impact_portion' in claim 15 to include a` frame' limitation based on statements from the prosecution_history because those statements were made with respect to the elastic deflection and operative engagement of the gap not to the structure of the impact_portion itself or the relationship of the impact_portion to the handle
finally demarini argues that the peng_¡¬164_patent demonstrates that the prior_art contemplates frames having large-diameter_impact_portions that are not integral with handles

we do not find any of these arguments to be persuasive
we note that claim_terms are not construed in a vacuum
rather to interpret claim_terms we look to all of the intrinsic_evidence as it pertains to the terms in question
we are however mindful that the language of the claims as allowed is what we construe and it is that language that determines the limitations *1328 of the claim
see intervet am. inc. v. kee-vet labs. inc. 887_f.2d_1050 1054 12_uspq2d_1474 1477 fed.cir.1989

a review of the prosecution_history convinces us that the district_court was correct in construing the language of the preamble of claim 15 to require that the` large-diameter_impact_portion' of the hollow_bat be a part of a bat_frame even though claim 15 does not explicitly include the claim_term` frame'

original_claim 15 recited in a hollow_bat an improvement comprising an internal_structural_insert defining an annular_gap with an inside_wall of the bat

in the first office action the examiner rejected demarinis original claim 15 as being anticipated by u.s._patent_no._5180,163 issued to lanctot et al
(` lanctot' under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 e indicating that spine 16 of lanctot was considered to be the insert

as can be seen in figures 1_and_2 immediately below the spine 16 figure 2 of lanctot is affixed within the handle_portion of the baseball bat comprising an elongated body with an impact_portion of one diameter tapering to a handle_portion with a reduced diameter
the spine is intended to dampen shock components generated when the bat strikes a ball
see col._3,_l._54- col._4,_l._45

?
in response to the lanctot rejection demarini amended claim 15 as follows in a hollow_bat having a small-diameter_handle_portion and a large_diameter_impact_portion an improvement comprising an internal_structural_insert defining an annular_gap with an inside_wall of the impact_portion of the bat

demarini further remarked that the foregoing amendment was made` to point out that the structural_insert defines an annular_gap with the inside_wall of the impact_portion of the bat'
furthermore demarini noted that the lanctot spine` is positioned in the handle_portion of the bat..' and that the lanctot` insert would not be positioned in the bat impact_portion..'

in view of that amendment the examiner rejected claim 15 as being anticipated by u.s. patent no._4056,267 issued to krieger` krieger' under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b
the examiner indicated that it *1329 was device 28 of krieger that was considered to be the insert

the structure of the krieger_bat can be seen in figure 1 immediately below
the krieger_bat 10 is a metal bat formed of a metal tube 12 having a handle_portion 14 with a knob 16 at one end and having a barrel portion 18 with an open end to which an end cap is welded
device 28 is a safety-strengthening device surrounded by foam in the tube and anchored between the barrel and handle ends of the bat
see krieger col._2,_l._57- col._3,_l._3

?
in response to the krieger rejection demarini again amended claim 15 adding the following phrase at the end of the claim` and the impact_portion elastically deflectable to close a portion of the annular_gap and operably engage the insert'
demarini remarked that this amendment was made` to distinguish over all of the references by reciting the frame_impact_portion being elastically deflectable to close a portion of the gap to engage the insert'

the foregoing prosecution_history clearly reflects that demarini considered the impact_portion to be a part of a hollow_bat structure i.e. a bat_frame even though claim 15 never included the word frame and even though some of the statements made distinguishing the invention from the prior_art as a whole reflect additional aspects of the invention
the foregoing is distinguishable from intervet where the applicant argued that all of the claims included a limitation added by amendment but which turned out to have only been added to certain claims not all of them
see intervet 887 f.2d at 1053-54 12 uspq2d at 1477
in this case it is clear that demarini first amended claim 15 to add the structural components of a handle_portion and an impact_portion to the claimed hollow_bat in order to distinguish the relationship of the insert to these components from similar components in the prior_art
moreover the original claim_language clearly indicates that the internal_structural_insert is not a structural element of the hollow_bat
thus demarini considered the handle_portion and the impact_portion to be part of a bat_frame that surrounded the internal_structural_insert even though the specific term` frame' was not used in claim 15

considering all of the intrinsic_evidence-i.e. the claim_language the written description and the prosecution_history we conclude that the` hollow_bat' having the` small-diameter_handle_portion' and the` large-diameter_impact_portion' of *big_token__1330_claim_15__big_token requires the handle and the impact_portion to be part of a frame that surrounds the claimed internal_structural_insert
as noted above we do however agree with demarini that the frame need not be fabricated as a single structural element
the pieces can be formed separately and connected prior to use of the bat in its intended environment

c. insert
in addition to the interpretation of the term` frame' as modified by the term` bat' it is necessary to construe the following phrases from claims 1 15 and 18 to understand the literal limitations of these claims 1` an insert positioned within the frame' claim 1 ; 2` an internal_structural_insert' claim 15 ; and 3 an` insert being held within the impact_portion' claim 18
demarini in its brief to this court proffers an` ordinary' definition of the term` insert' as` anything put or fit into something else'
worth does not contest this definition
with this definition demarini takes the position that any portion of the internal section of the bat extending beyond the large-diameter_impact_portion can not be the claimed` insert' but is instead an additional structural feature

while we accept demarinis proffered` ordinary' definition of the term` insert' we disagree with demarinis position noting that it is irrelevant to the claims at issue whether the` insert' is considered limited to something that is fully within the impact_portion or not since all three claims make clear that the bat_frame which includes the impact_portion and the handle completely surrounds and is separate from the` insert'

in claim 1 the` insert' is stated to be` positioned within the [ bat ] frame'
claim 15 sets forth the external structural_requirements of the bat as having a large-diameter_impact_portion tapering to a small-diameter_handle and it is in the bat so described that the internal_structural_insert is positioned
finally in claim 18 the structural_requirements of the` bat_frame' are set forth including a large-diameter_impact_portion and a small-diameter_handle_portion and the` insert' is noted to be` held within the impact_portion' of that` bat_frame'
the foregoing coupled with the undisputed definition of` insert' leads us to the inevitable conclusion that` an insert positioned within the frame' claim 1 ;` an internal_structural_insert' claim 15 ; and an` insert being held within the impact_portion' claim 18 means that the bat_frame which has a large-diameter_impact_portion tapering to a small-diameter_handle completely surrounds a piece of material the` insert' that is separate from the frame

we need not address the parties contentions regarding the district_courts construction of the terms` gap' and` interference_fit' because as will be discussed below comparison of the worth_est_bat to the claims in view of the interpretation of` frame' and` insert' is dispositive of the infringement_issues on appeal

ii
infringement
after claim construction the next step in an infringement analysis is comparing the properly construed claims with the allegedly infringing devices
see kemco sales inc. v. control papers co. 208_f.3d_1352 1360 54_uspq2d_1308 1312 fed.cir.2000
this is a question of fact
see id
thus if we agree with the district_court that there are no genuine_issues of material_fact regarding infringement of the ¡¬398_patent and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law we affirm the district_courts grant of summary_judgment
see fed.r.civ.p
56 c ; see also celotex 477 u.s. at 322 106_s.ct._2548 ; vehicular techs corp. v. titan wheel int l inc. 212_f.3d_1377 1381 54_uspq2d_1841 1843 fed.cir.2000 holding that a fact issue is not in genuine *1331 dispute if a reasonable_jury could only find in favor of the moving party

a. literal infringement
literal infringement of a claim occurs when every limitation recited in the claim appears in the accused device i.e. when` the properly construed claim reads on the accused device exactly'
amhil enters. ltd. v. wawa inc. 81_f.3d_1554 1562 38_uspq2d_1471 1476 fed.cir.1996

the only claim that demarini contends is literally infringed by the worth_est_bat is claim 15
the district_court concluded that there was no literal_infringement of this claim because there was no structural_insert internal to the frame of the est_bat
the court came to this conclusion because it determined that the only_structure of the worth_est_bat that could be the` frame' was the overall bat structure over which the shell is disposed because that was the only_structure having an integrated large-diameter portion tapered_portion and small-diameter_handle_portion

demarini contends the district_courts error is twofold
first demarini notes that reading` large-diameter_impact_portion' on the est hollow_body is contrary to agreed upon facts
second demarini asserts that the district_court improperly decided an issue of fact contrary to substantial_evidence
as to demarinis first contention demarini alleges that worths expert agreed that` impact' portion reads on the exterior_shell of the est
as to demarinis second contention demarini asserts that its expert attested to the est hollow_body inner tube being internal to the exterior_shell and that this testimony is substantial_evidence that the est_bat has a structural_insert internal to a frame as is claimed

we do not understand worths expert to have agreed that the claim_term` large-diameter_impact_portion' of claim 15 reads on the exterior_shell of the est
while it is true that worths expert agreed that the outer shell of the est_bat was the portion of the bat that impacted the ball this expert did not state that the shell was the` impact_portion' as that term was used in claim 15

moreover accepting demarinis experts testimony as substantial_evidence that the est_bat has a structural_insert internal to a frame as those terms are used in claim 15 runs contradictory to the construction of claim 15 set forth above
as we stated above the claimed insert must be contained within the bat_frame which frame includes an integrated large-diameter_impact_portion and small-diameter_handle
the hollow_body inner tube of the est_bat is not contained within such a bat_frame and the shell of the est_bat is not a bat_frame that includes an integrated large-diameter_impact_portion and small-diameter_handle

thus neither of demarinis arguments persuades us that worths est_bat literally infringes claim 15
consequently we affirm the district_courts conclusion on summary_judgment that worths est_bat does not literally infringe claim 15

b
infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
infringement under the doctrine of equivalents requires that the accused product contain each limitation of the claim or its equivalent
see warner-jenkinson co. v. hilton davis chem co. 520_u.s._17 40 117_s.ct._1040 137_l.ed.2d_146_(1997)` warner-jenkinson' noting that because each limitation contained in a patent_claim is material to defining the scope of the patented_invention a doctrine of equivalents analysis must be applied to individual claim_limitations not to the invention as a whole
an element in the accused product is equivalent *1332 to a claim_limitation if the differences between the two are` insubstantial' to one of ordinary skill in the art
see id

however there are limits to the application of the doctrine of equivalents aside from the question of insubstantiality of the differences
for instance there can be no infringement under the doctrine of equivalents if the asserted scope of equivalency would encompass the prior_art
see marquip inc. v. fosber am. inc. 198_f.3d_1363 1367 53_uspq2d_1015 1018 fed.cir.1999 ; wilson sporting goods v. david geoffrey & assoc. 904_f.2d_677 683 14_uspq2d_1942 1948 fed.cir.1990
in addition prosecution_history estoppel can prevent a patentee from relying on the doctrine of equivalents when the patentee relinquishes subject matter during the prosecution of the patent either by amendment or argument
see pharmacia & upjohn co. v. mylan pharm. inc. 170_f.3d_1373 1376-77 50_uspq2d_1033 1036 fed.cir.1999

furthermore the question of insubstantiality of the differences is inapplicable if a claim_limitation is totally missing from the accused device
see warner-jenkinson 520 u.s. at 33-34 117_s.ct._1040 ; pennwalt corp. v. durand-wayland inc. 833_f.2d_931 934-35 939 4_uspq2d_1737 1739-40 fed.cir.1987 en banc
however whether or not a limitation is deemed to be vitiated must take into account that when two elements of the accused device perform a single function of the patented_invention or when separate claim_limitations are combined into a single element of the accused device a claim_limitation is not necessarily vitiated and the doctrine of equivalents may still apply if the differences are insubstantial
see dolly inc. v. spalding & evenflo companies inc. 16_f.3d_394 398 29_uspq2d_1767 1769-70 fed.cir.1994

demarini argued before the district_court that the est accomplishes the same function increasing the trampoline deflection in substantially the same way with a leaf-spring-like action to achieve substantially the same result improved hitting performance
moreover demarini contended that like the accused infringing device in corning_glass works v. sumitomo electric u.s.a. inc. 868_f.2d_1251 9_uspq2d_1962_(fed.cir.1989) worths est_bat presented a classic example of transposition of two elements
therefore demarini argued that infringement under the doctrine of equivalents should be upheld on summary_judgment just as it was in corning_glass

in framing the issue this way demarini improperly directed the district_courts attention away from the language of the claims and toward a more general_comparison of the overall attributes of the accused device with those of the claimed device
however in this case the district_court properly avoided such a general_comparison and instead compared the limitations of the claims with the specific elements of the accused device
in making this proper comparison the district_court did not accept demarinis argument of insubstantial differences

the district_court distinguished corning_glass on the ground that in corning_glass an alternative design was unknown to science whereas eggiman had considered an exterior_shell design over a frame and still chose words that narrowly defined the claimed invention
the court noted that the est_bat consists of two pieces when assembled namely a bat_frame plus an exterior_shell
the court remarked that the est shell is conceptually quite distant from an insert and an internal location is substantially different from an external location
in other_words the court concluded that the differences between the insert required by the claims and the ests shell are substantial
thus the court determined that summary_judgment of no infringement of claims 1 15 and 18 under the doctrine of equivalents was mandated

*1333 demarini contends that the district_courts attempt to distinguish corning_glass is erroneous in that there is no requirement that equivalents be unknown to science at the time of the application
demarini is correct in this regard
nevertheless the district_courts decision was not inconsistent with our decision in corning_glass

demarini characterizes corning_glass as a mere reversal of parts case involving the reciprocal_change of coacting elements
while we agree with demarini that in corning_glass the alleged infringer effected a reciprocal_change in the accused device to achieve the identical result of the claimed device we disagree that the reciprocal_change was a reversal of structure
thus we disagree with demarini that the difference in worths est_bat compared to the claimed bat is just like corning_glass

in corning_glass the patented_invention related to an optical fiber having a doped fused silica core and a fused silica cladding around the core such that the cores refractive index ri was greater than that of the cladding i.e. a positive_ri_differential
868 f.2d at 1255 9 uspq2d at 1964
this refraction differential channeled light signals through the core for optical communications
id.at 1254 9 uspq2d at 1963
according to the claims the core included a positive dopant in excess of that of the cladding layer to provide a positive_ri_differential
id.at 1256 9 uspq2d at 1965
the accused fiber contained no dopant in the core
id.at 1259-60 9 uspq2d at 1968-69
instead this fiber achieved a positive_ri_differential by having negative dopant in the cladding
id
thus the accused fiber retained a core a cladding and a dopant to maintain the relationship of the respective ri between the core and the cladding
in other_words no structural_claim_limitations were rearranged only the relative characteristics of the structures were reciprocally changed

in the case at bar the difference between the accused bat and the claimed invention is more profound than in corning_glass
to compare the claimed insert to the worth est shell involves a structural rearrangement and redefinition of claim_limitations in which the functional_relationships of these structural limitations is not maintained i.e. if the claimed insert is the exterior_shell of the est the large diameter portion of the est frame is no longer available to be impacted by the ball
corning_glass is factually quite different from the instant case and therefore does not control the outcome here
in moore u.s.a. inc. v. standard register co. 229_f.3d_1091 56_uspq2d_1225_(fed.cir.2000) we noted that` [ w ] hile sanitary refrigerator [ co. v. winters 280_u.s._30 50_s.ct._9 74_l.ed._147_(1929) ] undisputedly refers toreciprocal_changes it nowhere authorizes the rearrangement of claim_limitations'
id.at 1108
similarly we note that corning_glass does not authorize rearrangement of structural_claim_limitations

to support its contention that the worth_est_bat merely reverses parts of the claimed invention demarini presents a hypothetical_claim allegedly showing that each limitation is met by a corresponding reversed-parts complement in the est
the hypothetical_claim 1 is as follows 1
a bat comprising a hollow_tubular_bat_frame having a circular cross-section ; and
an [ insert ] shell positioned [ within ] outside the frame the [ insert ] shell having a circular cross-section the [ insert ] shell having first and second_ends adjoining the tubular_frame the [ insert ] shell being separated from the tubular_frame by a gap forming at least_part of an annular_shape along a central_portion between said first and second_ends the [ frame ] shell elastically deflectable across the gap to operably *1334 engage the [ insert ] frame along a portion of the insert between the [ insert ] shell first and second_ends
( bracketed material deleted and underlined material added

we do not find this hypothetical_claim argument persuasive noting in particular that in rewording the claim to accommodate the reciprocal_change argument while maintaining some semblance of the claimed structural and functional_relationships between the bat_frame and the insert demarini substitutes the term` insert' in some cases for the term` shell' and in other_cases for the term` frame ;' and it substitutes the term` shell' in some cases for the term` insert' and in other_cases for the term` frame'
in its own example demarini is unable to merely substitute the term` shell' for` insert' or` shell' for` frame'
instead it has to rely on linguistic chicanery
demarinis hypothetical_claim emphatically shows that this is not a case of a mere_reciprocal_change of two interacting elements where one element can not be changed without changing the other to make it operative but involves a clear difference between the structure of the alleged infringing product and the invention as it has been defined by the limitations of the claims as drafted

it is one thing to effect a mere_reciprocal_change but it is quite another thing when a limitation in a claim is simply missing
in the present case the claims as properly construed require an insert contained within a bat_frame comprised of a handle_portion a tapered_portion and an impact_portion
the est_bat does not have such a configuration instead having an exterior_shell in which the insert that is positioned within the shell has a handle and extends beyond the shell
`` if [ demarini ] who was responsible for drafting and prosecuting the patent intended something different it could have prevented this result through clearer drafting'
hoganas ab v. dresser indus. inc. 9_f.3d_948 951 28_uspq2d_1936 1939 fed.cir.1993
we are thus constrained to conclude that no reasonable juror could read the claims in issue on the est_bat structure
the district_court concluded that an inference of no infringement under the doctrine of equivalents arises when a competitor attempts to design around a patent
such a conclusion is clearly inconsistent with the supreme courts decision in warner-jenkinson 520 u.s. at 36 117_s.ct._1040` intent plays no role in the application of the doctrine of equivalents'
we nevertheless agree that equivalence is untenable in light of the claims as properly construed
thus we affirm the district_courts grant of summary_judgment of no infringement under the doctrine of equivalents

conclusion
in light of our disposition of the infringement_issues we need not and do not address worths cross-appeal on the construction of the claim_terms` gap' and` interference_fit'

affirmed
