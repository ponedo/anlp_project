food processor brought action against competitor for patent_infringement trademark_infringement unfair_competition and trademark_dilution with respect to its lattice-shape waffle-cut partially fried potato_product
the united_states_district_court for the eastern_district of washington alan a. mcdonald j. ruled that plaintiffs patent was invalid and unenforceable 818_f.supp._1376 and appeal was taken
the court of appeals held that 1 patent for process of making frozen partially fried lattice-shaped french_fries called` waffle_fries' was invalid as obvious and 2 determination that patent was invalid as obvious made it unnecessary to determine whether patent was unenforceable because of inequitable_conduct

background
lamb-weston is a food processing company that sells frozen_potato_products
the defendants mccain_foods companies mccain compete with lamb-weston in the frozen_potato_products industry
both lamb-weston and mccain make partially fried parfried and frozen_potato_products
fierce competition in the frozen_potato_products market spurs development of new_products
this litigation centers around lamb-westons development of frozen parfried lattice-shaped french_fries called` waffle_fries'

*542 in october 1979 an independent inventor mr._matsler offered to confidentially disclose his waffle fry slicing_apparatus to lamb-weston
in january 1980 mr._matsler demonstrated his slicing_apparatus but 98 % of the waffle fry slices were unusable
nevertheless lamb-weston began negotiations with mr._matslers patent attorney to license the technology
instead of contracting with lamb-weston mr._matsler licensed his invention to a lamb-weston competitor j.r. simplot company

in december 1979 mr._matsler demonstrated his cutting machine to a j.r. simplot representative
mr._matsler fried some of his potato_slices and distributed them to customers at a local dairy queen restaurant in dallas oregon

in february 1980 lamb-weston received a letter from mr._jayne another inventor offering to confidentially disclose his waffle fry cutting apparatus
in march 1980 lamb-weston evaluated mr._jaynes machine but found it unacceptable
lamb-weston terminated communications with mr._jayne
lamb-weston then began developing its own machine starting with a commercial machine for making waffle-style potato_chips and adapting it to make waffle_fries

lamb-weston started testing its waffle_fries in 1980 and began selling them in late 1983 under the trademark` crisscut'
in august 1983 lamb-weston filed a patent_application in the united states patent and trademark office pto on the waffle-cut potato_product the slicing_apparatus and the process for making the product
the patent_application had serial no._06 /525,115 the115 application

the pto initially rejected the application because it encompassed more than one invention
37 c.f.r.¡± 1.141 1995
lamb-weston elected to proceed solely on the cutting apparatus claims which issued as u.s._patent_no._4523,503 the503_patent
this patent is not at issue in this case

lamb-weston separated the process claims out of the115 application
the patent_examiner initially rejected this divisional application serial no._06 /682,366 the366 application as obvious over references disclosed on the face of the patent namely canada patent no._898057 starke u.s. patent no._678514 regnier u.s._patent_no._2612,453 stahmer u.s._patent_no._2767,752 stahmer ii u.s._patent_no._1937,049 toland et_al
) u.s._patent_no._3139,130 urschel and u.s._patent_no._1506,166 boon
boon discloses a method for preparing frozen partially cooked french_fries
the other_references disclose waffle-shaped potato_products and slicing_apparatus
the examiner determined that one of ordinary_skill in the art would have found it obvious to freeze the waffle-cut potato_products disclosed in the other_references as boon suggests

to escape this rejection lamb-weston amended the366 application
lamb-weston emphasized that the prior_art disclosed waffle-cut potato_chips having a thickness of ?
inch or less unlike the lamb-weston_invention with a thickness of about 4/big_token__16_to_10__big_token /16_inch
despite the amendments the examiner finally rejected the366 application on january 23 1986

lamb-weston appealed the final rejection to the pto_board of patent appeals and interferences board
in january 1990 the board reversed the examiners rejection
the366 application issued as the084_patent the patent in dispute in this case

the084_patent claims a parfried frozen potato slice
claims 1_through_4 of the084_patent read 1
a parfried_potato_product suitable for reconstitution by cooking comprising a frozen sliced_potato_section having a substantially ellipsoidal_shape and a variable_thickness including a peak to peak_thickness within the range of about 4/big_token__16_to_10__big_token /16_inch ; the section including opposed first and second_sides each side having longitudinal_ridges and grooves therebetween the ridges and grooves of the first_side extending angularly to the ridges and grooves of the second_side ; the grooves of the first and second_sides having a depth sufficient to intersect one another to form a grid of openings in the potato_section ; *543 the section before reconstitution having an oil_content of about 6-20 % by weight and a solids_content of about 32-40 % by weight ; whereby the product upon reconstitution by cooking is characterized by very thin crisp_portions of locally increased oil_flavor adjacent the openings relatively thick_portions defined by intersecting ridges having an internal_mealy_texture and strong_potato_flavor similar to thick-cut french fried potato_strips and portions of intermediate_thickness whose characteristics are similar to french_fried_shoe_string_potato_strips
2
the product of claim 1 wherein the section has an oil_content of about 16-20 % by weight and a solids_content of about 55-65 % by weight after oil fry reconstitution at a temperature within the range of about 350¢X_f to 360¢X_f for about 135-big_token__165_seconds._3__big_token
the product of claim 1 wherein the section has an oil_content of about 16-20 % by weight and a solids_content of about 55-65 % by weight after reconstitution whereby the thickest portions of the product have characteristics akin to thick-cut french fried potato_strips thinnest_portions have characteristics akin to potato_chips and other portions have characteristics akin to french_fried_shoe_string_potato_strips
4
the product of claim 1 wherein the peak-to-peak_thickness is about 7/16_inch

in 1985 mccain began making and selling frozen parfried waffle_fries
lamb-weston sued mccain for patent_infringement trademark_infringement unfair_competition and trademark_dilution
mccain counterclaimed for a declaratory_judgment of patent invalidity and unenforceability and for damages under the antitrust laws
mccain later withdrew the antitrust claims

the district_court decided the issues of infringement enablement indefiniteness and inventorship in lamb-westons favor
the parties did not appeal these issues
the district_court decided the trademark and unfair_competition claims in mccains favor
the parties also did not appeal these issues

during the district_court proceedings lamb-weston conceded that waffle-cut potato_products were known since the early 1900s
the district_court found that waffle_fries were available at restaurants before lamb-weston developed its crisscut fry
for example as early as 1935_and_1936 the gem cafe in plainsville texas served waffle_fries as a staple item
in 1979 the plaza restaurant in quincy illinois sold waffle_fries
in 1981 general slicing/red goat disposers sold a commercial electric slicing machine capable of slicing 5/16_inch thick waffle fry slices

in addition the district_court examined u.s._patent_no._3397,993 the strong_patent and found it relevant to obviousness under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 1994
the strong_patent describes a parfry_process where potato_slices are steam-blanched air-dried parfried and then frozen
lamb-weston as well as other potato processing companies uses the strong_patent parfry_process to prepare frozen parfried french_fries and reconstituted fries having all the textural limitations of the084_patent
the district_court held that this process would have been familiar to a person of ordinary_skill in the art at the time of lamb-westons waffle fry invention

the district_court however did not find that the prior waffle fry uses and sales in the 1930s and the strong_patent_process provided the motivation to combine the waffle-cut potato_chips with the known parfried potato technology
the district_court said however that the matsler and jayne_devices provided that motivation
the district_court held the084_patent claims invalid as obvious in light of the matsler and jayne_devices in combination with the prior parfried frozen potato technology including the strong_patent
the district_court also found lamb-westons084_patent unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct
lamb-weston appeals obviousness and inequitable_conduct determinations to this court

standard of review
the ultimate determination of obviousness is a legal conclusion resting on factual determinations under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103
*544 in re vaeck 947_f.2d_488 493 20_uspq2d_1438 1442 fed.cir.1991
this court reviews these factual underpinnings for clear error in light of the evidence

obviousness
the district_court held that the matsler and jayne slicing devices provided the motivation for a person of ordinary_skill in the art to combine the known waffle-cut potato_chips with the strong_patent_process to produce frozen parfried and reconstituted waffle_fries
lamb-weston inc. v. mccain_foods inc. 818_f.supp._1376 1390 e.d.wash.1993
this court finds it unnecessary to examine the appropriateness of the matsler and jayne slicing devices as prior_art although protected under nondisclosure_agreements to provide this motivation to combine
* we find it is the potato_products resulting from these slicing devices and not merely the devices themselves that create the motivation to combine
unlike the slicing_apparatus the potato_products were not subject to confidentiality agreements
in addition to the prior_art cited to the examiner during prosecution the district_court found that waffle_fries were available at restaurants as early as 1935

in an extraordinarily thorough and carefully reasoned opinion the district_court examined the prior_art applicable to the084_patent the examiner rejected the claims in the366 application under ¡± 103 finding the claimed invention unpatentable over starke regnier stahmer stahmer i toland et_al. and urschel when viewed in light of boon
...
frozen parfried french_fries of various configurations and degrees of thickness were well known in the art at the time of the claimed invention
major potato processors such as lamb-weston and mccain were producing frozen parfried french_fries in the thicknesses varying from less than a quarter of an inch to more than half of an inch
...
the two most common dry fry processes used by potato processors were taught by the strong and chase patents
...
it would have been obvious to one of ordinary_skill in the art to take a prior_art waffle-cut potato fry cut it so that the peak to peak_thickness falls within the standard 4/big_token__16_to_10__big_token /16_inch range for french_fries and apply a parfry_process commonly used in the industry in order to develop a frozen parfried waffle-cut potato_product suitable for reconstitution by finish frying
lamb-weston 818 f.supp.at 1389-90

the matsler and jayne waffle-shaped potato_slices themselves were not subject to nondisclosure_agreements
in fact matsler and a representative from j.r. simplot distributed waffle-shaped potato fries at a dairy queen for a test
jayne sent pictures of *545 waffle-sliced potatoes from his machine to manufacturers including lamb-weston
these disclosures were not secret
therefore these disclosures fall within the terms of prior_art defined by section 102 a or section 102 g

although the district_court should have found the motivation to combine without examining the matsler and jayne_devices the district_court reached the correct_conclusion of obviousness
while the district_court expressed the motivation to combine in terms of the matsler and jayne_devices and section 102 f the district_court actually found a motivation for the claimed invention in reviewing the matsler and jayne potato_product where it was lacking in the prior_art_references before the board
parfried potato_products were well known in the prior_art
however no reference to a waffle-cut potato_product of sufficient_thickness to merit parfrying was before the board
because the references before the board were thin like potato_chips the board did not conclude that one of ordinary_skill in the art would have frozen a conventional potato chip and reconstituted it by frying
in contrast the district_court found that` [ t ] he correspondence exchanged between matsler and lamb-weston indicate [ d ] that the device was intended to cut french_fries and not potato_chips'
lamb-weston 818_f.supp._1376 at 1389
even though the district_court need not have found the motivation to combine in the matsler and jayne_devices any error was harmless because the district_court reached the correct_conclusion of obviousness

ample prior_art suggests a motivation to cook potato_products of various shapes using a parfry_process
for example the strong_patent describes a parfry_process used on shoe-string french_fries
the matsler and jayne_potato_products however supplied waffle-shaped potato_products of the appropriate thickness for the known parfry_process
the motivation to combine arose therefore because the size and shape of matsler and jayne_potato_products suggested application of the parfry_process to thicker products

the motivation to parfry the matsler and jayne_potato_products in making the claimed invention derives from 1 the extensive prior_art disclosing the desirability of parfrying potato_products and 2 the suitability of the matsler and jayne_potato_products for the parfry_process
the evidence of prior_use and sale of waffle_fries and parfried_potato_products in addition to the matsler and jayne_potato_slices provides sufficient_motivation to combine the known waffle-cut shape and the parfry cooking method of the strong_patent
this combination renders the084_patent obvious

because patented before lamb-westons invention the references disclosed to the patent_examiner were prior_art under section 102 a of title 35
similarly the knowledge and use of waffle_fries in the 1930s occurred before the invention and are prior_art under section 102 a
the potato_products produced from the matsler and jayne slicing_apparatus were not under nondisclosure_agreements and therefore qualify as prior_art under section 102 a
this court is not applying a new rule of obviousness in this case
these relevant references count collectively toward the teachings of prior_art as a whole

denied 474_u.s._843 106_s.ct._131 88_l.ed.2d_108_(1985)

the prior_art parfried_potato_product references and the knowledge and use of waffle-cut potato_products of sufficient_thickness and shape suitable for parfrying as exemplified by the matsler and jayne_potato_products and the waffle_fries sold in the 1930s provided the motivation to combine the waffle-cut shape with the parfry_process of the strong_patent
the prior_art suggests the desirability and the obviousness of such a combination
the claims of the084_patent are invalid as obvious

unenforceability
this court need not reach the unenforceability issue of the084_patent ; it is thus vacated
such a decision not to review unenforceability is not inconsistent with the supreme_courts mandate in *546 cardinal_chemical co. v. morton international inc. 508_u.s._83 113_s.ct._1967 124_l.ed.2d_1 26_uspq2d_1721_(1993)
the question in that case was` whether the affirmance by [ this court ] of a finding that a patent has not been infringed is a sufficient reason' by itself` for vacating a declaratory_judgment holding the patent invalid'
super sack mfg corp. v. chase packaging corp. 57_f.3d_1054 1060 35_uspq2d_1139 1144 fed.cir.1995 quoting cardinal_chemical 508 u.s. at 84-86 113 s.ct.at 1969
the supreme_courts decision in cardinal_chemical is limited to the specific facts of that case
specifically an affirmance by this court of a finding of noninfringement is not by itself enough to vacate a declaratory_judgment holding the patent invalid

the supreme_court specified that factors such as judicial economy may nevertheless support a determination not to review validity
unlike the situation in cardinal_chemical however this court has determined invalidity
it is merely unenforceability that is set aside
there is no risk that others will be subject to infringement suits in the future because lamb-westons084_patent is invalid
there is no need to secure this courts determination regarding the unenforceability of an invalid patent

this court affirms the invalidity judgment because the084_patent is obvious in light of the prior_art
this court vacates the inequitable_conduct claim because it is redundant under these circumstances

costs
each party shall bear its own costs

affirmed and vacated

pauline_newman circuit_judge dissenting
the district_courts rulings of both obviousness and inequitable_conduct depend on the courts application of the law of derivation 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 f
the district_court found that the prior_art lacks a teaching suggestion or motivation to combine the references that are necessary to make the invention obvious,1 and then erroneously invoked ¡± 102 f to provide that motivation
the panel_majority finds` motivation' simply in its observation that raw and fully cooked_waffle-cut potatoes existed in the prior_art apparently holding that the mere thickness of these known products as compared with potato_chips is the` motivation' that made obvious the invention of a previously unknown product as described in claims 1_and_4 of the patent in suit.2 the panel_majority holds that this new_product would have been obvious despite the failure of the industry to have produced it the several_years of experimentation and development incurred by lamb-weston and the absence of teaching or suggestion in the prior_art as to what to make and how to make it
lamb-westons recognition of the potential of its proposed new_product is not the teaching suggestion or motivation that precedent requires
see uniroyal inc. v. rudkin-wiley corp. 837_f.2d_1044 1050-51 5_uspq2d_1434 1439 fed.cir
( the prior_art must contain the suggestion to make the specific combination that is claimed cert
denied *547 488_u.s._825 109_s.ct._75 102_l.ed.2d_51_(1988) ; in re geiger 815_f.2d_686 688 2_uspq2d_1276 1278 fed.cir.1987 obviousness is not established by combining the teachings of the prior_art` absent some teaching suggestion or incentive supporting the combination`
indeed the long existence of raw and fully cooked_waffle-cut potatoes if anything weighs against the obviousness of producing such a product in partially fried and frozen form
commercial success failure of others and copying are all evidence of unobviousness not obviousness
see graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 17-18 86_s.ct._684 693-94 15_l.ed.2d_545 148_uspq_459 467 1966 ; cooper v. ford motor co. 748_f.2d_677 679 223_uspq_1286 1287 fed.cir.1984

a
recognition of the value of a new product is not a` motivation' in the prior art
it is undisputed that raw and cooked_waffle-cut potatoes have long been known
it is also undisputed that the prior_art does not show partially fried and frozen_waffle-cut potatoes capable of reconstitution to provide a mixture of tastes and textures as described in the084_patent
on reconstitution the thinnest regions at the edges of the grid openings are described as tasting like crisp potato_chips the thickest regions like thick-cut french fried potatoes and the intermediate regions like shoestring potatoes

on reconstitution the product must be cooked all the way through not raw on the inside ; it must be mealy not greasy limp or starchy ; and it must be crisp yet not caramelized burnt on the thinnest_portions
there was testimony that the greater the contrast between the thickest and thinnest_portions in the waffle cut the more uncertain the successful production of a partially fried and frozen_product that can be successfully reconstituted

the prior_art shows waffle-cut potatoes raw and fully cooked ; the prior_art shows thin lattice-cut potato_chips ; and the prior_art shows partially fried and frozen_potatoes generally in the french-fry_shape
the novelty of the claimed product is not disputed
the pto_board has recognized that for a combination of prior_art_references to render an invention obvious` [ t ] here must be some reason suggestion or motivation found in the prior_art whereby a person of ordinary_skill in the field of the invention would make the combination'
in re oetiker 977_f.2d_1443 1447 24_uspq2d_1443 1446 fed.cir.1992
the board correctly declined to reason backward from the lamb-weston_invention and allowed the claims explaining that` the examiner has not established the requisite motivation which would have led one having ordinary_skill in the art to modify the primary references [ lattice shaped sliced potatoes ] by preparing a frozen potato_product'
no ensuing information has materially affected this reasoning

b
the district court recognized the absence of suggestion to combine prior art references
the district_court had a more extensive collection of prior_art than was before the patent office but within the same two groups of subject_matter
in one group were the waffle-cut potatoes raw and cooked and assorted devices to aid in cutting this shape
several machines had been devised in attempts to mechanize the cutting including those of messrs._matsler and jayne although none produced a waffle-cut slice thicker than six millimeters or 0.236 inch

the other group of prior_art_references showed partially fried and frozen_potatoes
several manufacturers made such products particularly in french-fry_shape
lamb-westons witnesses including persons employed by lamb-westons competitors testified as to the technologic problems caused by the varying thicknesses of the waffle-cut potato
witnesses pointed out the difficulties in producing a partially fried and frozen_product that would on reconstitution be fully cooked and pleasant tasting in its thickest parts without being burnt or unpleasant in taste or texture in any other parts
witnesses testified that it required several_years of work for lamb-weston to achieve such a product
an employee of a competitor simplot testified that
it was very difficult to control the textures
the laboratory people had put in a lot of time and effort into trying to understand *548 the blanching times frying times and process parameters in general to come up with a product that would even be acceptable to our standards of a product going into the food service marketplace
it was not challenged that lamb-weston conducted extensive experimentation in the course of developing the patented_product
several competitors had seen and tested the matsler and jayne_machines and products but none had made the invention made by lamb-weston
the failure of others to do what the patentee achieved is strong evidence of nonobviousness
uniroyal inc. v. rudkin-wiley corp. 837 f.2d at 1054 5 uspq2d at 1440-41 ; see w.l
gore & assocs. inc. v. garlock inc. 721_f.2d_1540 1553 220_uspq_303 313 fed.cir.1983 objective considerations serve` as insurance against the insidious attraction of the siren hindsight' cert

the district_court recognized as had the board that the prior_art contained no teaching suggestion or motivation to select from the two groups of references in the way that would produce the product described and claimed in the084_patent
however the district_court found such` motivation' in the machines of messrs._matsler and jayne
the district_court did not find that mr._matsler or mr._jayne knew or taught how to make the partially fried/frozen_waffle-cut potatoes of the084_patent
however the district_court found that the matsler and jayne_machines and their known waffle-cut product were prior_art for the purpose of` derivation' under ¡± 102 f3 and that when combined with the other prior_art they filled the gap in the ¡± 103 obviousness_determination
in this the district_court erred for even if the disclosure of these machines and their product spurred lamb-weston into action inspiration or spur is not a` teaching suggestion or motivation' to combine selected references in a specific way to make a specifically detailed new_product

to defeat patentability based on obviousness the suggestion to make the new_product having the claimed characteristics must come from the prior_art not from the hindsight knowledge of the invention that was made by lamb-weston
see interconnect planning corp. v. feil 774_f.2d_1132 1143 227_uspq_543 551 fed.cir.1985 when prior_art_references require selective combination by the court to render obvious a subsequent invention there must be some reason for the combination other than the hindsight gleaned from the invention itself
there must be` something in the prior_art as a whole to suggest the desirability and thus the obviousness of making the combination'
( citing acs hosp sys. inc. v. montefiore hosp. 732_f.2d_1572 1577 & n. 14 221_uspq_929 933 & n. 14 fed.cir.1984 and lindemann maschinenfabrik gmbh v. american hoist and derrick co. 730_f.2d_1452 1462 221_uspq_481 488 fed.cir.1984

the district_court found that lamb-weston received an idea from matsler and jayne that` when combined with the relevant prior_art and the ordinary level of skill in the art renders the claimed invention obvious' the court holding the patent invalid under ¡± 102 f combined with ¡± 103
lamb-weston 818 f.supp.at 1388
the district_court held that` [ t ] he derived information constitutes prior_art under section 102 f even if it is secret has not been reduced to practice or is abandoned'
id
that is not a correct general statement for secret or abandoned knowledge is not prior_art.4 derived knowledge can indeed be invalidating but it is not *549 properly described as` prior_art' which is defined as actual or presumed public_knowledge
in kimberly-clark corp. v. johnson & johnson 745_f.2d_1437 223_uspq_603_(fed.cir.1984) the court explained that prior_art in patent law is knowledge that is available to the public

[ i ] t has been unusual that opinions have explained the real reason for the denial of patent rights which is the basic principle to which there are minor exceptions that no patent should be granted which withdraws from the public domain technology already available to the public
it is available in legal_theory at least when it is described in the worlds accessible literature including patents or has been publicly known or in the public use or on sale` in this country'
35 usc ¡± 102 a and b
that is the real meaning of` prior_art' in legal_theory-it is knowledge that is available including what would be obvious from it at a given time to a person of ordinary_skill in an art
id.at 1453 223 uspq at 614 citations omitted
thus 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 a and b define prior_art as what is known in the literature or deemed to be publicly available through use or sale and ¡± 102 e establishes an inference of public_knowledge of an issued patent as of its filing_date
sections 102 c d f and g state additional conditions of patentability and serve different purposes than do the prior_art provisions
section ¡± 102 f relates to` derivation' the taking of the invention of another and patenting it as ones own
it is irrelevant whether or not that invention is also prior_art
as explained in in re bass ¡± 102 f relates to originality that` one whodid not himself invent the subject_matter i.e. he did not originate it has no right to a patent on it'
in re bass 474_f.2d_1276 1290 59_ccpa_1342 177_uspq_178 189 1973 legislatively modified on other grounds

thus ¡± 102 f prohibits the patenting of an invention made by someone else
however the district_court did not find that mr._matsler or mr._jayne invented the subject_matter of the084_patent
their communication to lamb-weston was a machine and its product
the product was already known to the art
there is no allegation that lamb-weston obtained a patent on subject_matter that` he did not himself invent' bass supra
a patented_invention is not` derived' from another person unless that other person was in possession of the invention

accepting for the purpose of this discussion that messrs._matsler and jayne spurred lamb-westons interest in developing the patented_product ¡± 102 f is not concerned with inspiration or spur
whatever the relationship between lamb-weston and mr._matsler or mr._jayne invalidity based on derivation requires that the patentee in the words of the statute did not invent the subject_matter that was patented
the district_court erred in holding that in accordance with ¡± 102 f the matsler and jayne_machines and products filled the gap in the teachings of the prior_art by motivating lamb-weston to make the invention described in the084_patent
as i have discussed a commercial motivation is not a technologic suggestion to combine reference teachings
the panel_majority similarly errs although without reliance on ¡± 102 f in holding that the known waffle-cut potatoes produced on the matsler and jayne_machines provided the motivation to make the invention of the084_patent5

*550 c. this courts incorrect new criterion of obviousness
although it was apparent to the board and indeed to the district_court that the084 invention would not have been obvious from the prior_art the majority of this panel holds that the existence of waffle-cut potatoes which had been known for many decades` creates the motivation to combine' the prior_art_references
the panel_majority finds this motivation in` the knowledge and use of waffle_fries sold in the 1930s' and states that` the evidence of prior_use and sale of waffle_fries in addition to the matsler and jayne_potato_slices provides sufficient_motivation to combine the known waffle-cut shape and the parfry cooking method of the strong_patent'
that is the panel_majority holds that the prior existence of raw and fully cooked_waffle-cut potatoes provided the motivation to combine previously uncombined references to make the new parfried frozen_product under the selected conditions described and claimed in the084_patent

the federal_circuit has attempted to set a uniform standard whereby the teaching suggestion or motivation to combine prior_art information must itself come from the knowledge in the prior_art
the concept of a new_product is not the` motivation' that negates patentability
that inventors hope to profit from their invention is irrelevant to the determination of obviousness
the motivation to which precedent is directed is that which would make obvious the technologic advance not the motivation to achieve a competitive advantage

d. inequitable conduct
the district_court held that there was inequitable_conduct because lamb-weston did not tell the patent_examiner of the matsler and jayne_machines and their product which the district_court viewed as prior_art under ¡± 102 f
this position was incorrect as i have discussed and the district_courts holding of inequitable_conduct should be reversed

summary
the pto_board held that there was no suggestion in the prior_art to combine the prior_art_references to make the claimed product
the district_court agreed but found such suggestion in messrs._matsler and jaynes unsuccessful machines and known potato_product holding that these were prior_art under ¡± 102 f
the panel_majority finds the motivation to combine prior_art_references in the existence of the known waffle-cut potato and in the potential commercial value of the patented_invention
i respectfully but with concern dissent from this courts departure from the laws of ¡± 102 f and ¡± 103

footnotes
* this court need not reach the significant issue of whether section 102 f of title 35 defines prior_art for an obviousness_determination under section 103 because among other reasons the matsler and jayne_potato_slices were separate from the machines that produced them and were not confidential
in any event this court need not reach this issue
the dissent has provided certain citations of authority for the proposition that section 102 f may not be used as prior_art under section 103
however the following contrary authorities should also be considered 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 1994` subject_matter developed by another person which qualifies as prior_art only under subsection f or g of section 102 [ shall not preclude patentability if owned by the same entity ]'

claims 1_and_4 are as follows 1
a parfried_potato_product suitable for reconstitution by cooking comprising a frozen sliced_potato_section having a substantially ellipsoidal_shape and a variable_thickness including a peak to peak_thickness within the range of about 4/big_token__16_to_10__big_token /16_inch ; the section including opposed first and second_sides each side having longitudinal_ridges and grooves therebetween the ridges and grooves of the first_side extending angularly to the ridges and grooves of the second_side ; the grooves of the first and second_sides having a depth sufficient to intersect one another to form a grid of openings in the potato_section ; the section before reconstitution having an oil_content of about 6-20 % by weight and a solids_content of about 32-40 % by weight ; whereby the product upon reconstitution by cooking is characterized by very thin crisp_portions of locally increased oil_flavor adjacent the openings relatively thick_portions defined by intersecting ridges having an internal_mealy_texture and strong_potato_flavor similar to thick-cut french fried potato_strips and portions of intermediate_thickness whose characteristics are similar to french_fried_shoe_string_potato_strips

35 u.s.c.¡± 102
a person shall be entitled to a patent unless-.. f he did not himself invent the subject_matter sought to be patented

except for the condition stated in 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 e whereby upon issuance of a patent the filing_date is deemed its effective date for prior_art purposes despite the secrecy of pending patent_applications
if the patent_application does not issue and is not referred to in an issued patent its content remains secret and does not become prior_art

the panel_majority cites by footnote the second paragraph of ¡± 103 as` authority' for the proposition that ¡± 102 f information is prior_art
the cited provision was added to ¡± 103_in_1984 to facilitate team research by precluding the citation of the work of one team member as prior_art against the invention of another

elect. 488_f.2d_382 180_uspq_225 1st
cir.1973 which states broadly that all of ¡± 102 qualifies as prior_art an oversimplification never endorsed by the federal_circuit
nor does the partial quotation from chisum or the usage in new england braiding advance consideration of the matter
should there indeed be the conflict proposed by the panel_majority our obligation is to resolve it particularly because of the incorrect application of ¡± 102 f by the district_court as reported at 818_f.supp._1376
further the panel_majority inappropriately intermingles its ¡± 102 f analysis with the issue of confidentiality
