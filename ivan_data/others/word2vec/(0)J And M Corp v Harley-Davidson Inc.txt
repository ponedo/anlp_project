the district_court held that u.s. reissue patent number 34,525 is not infringed by the motorcycle_helmet_accessories manufactured and distributed by harley-davidson inc. and radio_sound inc.` harley-davidson'

harley-davidson_cross-appeals the courts conclusion that j & m was not estopped from asserting infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
because the court correctly concluded that the accused accessories do not infringe literally or under the doctrine of equivalents we affirm

background
j & m is the exclusive licensee of reissue patent number 34,525` the ¡¬525_patent` directed to helmet_accessories for mounting a microphone and an electrical_plug on a motorcycle_helmet
the microphone and electrical_plug form part of an audio system that allows motorcyclists to communicate with companions while riding
j & ms patented accessories have two components a microphone_mount and a plug_mount
the microphone_mount secures a microphone_boom that may be positioned near a motorcyclists mouth
the plug_mount secures an electrical_plug that receives wires from the microphone_mount and from earphones mounted in the helmet interior
the electrical_plug also mates with a second electrical_plug that receives wires leading to electronic audio equipment attached to the motorcycle frame

john and melinda lazzeroni` applicants' filed the application that led to the ¡¬525_patent on december 8 1988
helmet_accessories for mounting a microphone and electrical_plug on a motorcycle_helmet were known as of this filing date but applicants claimed accessories that allegedly were superior to the prior_art
as stated in the written description some prior_art_accessories were mounted via holes drilled into the helmet causing undesirable damage to the motorcycle_helmet
¡¬525_patent col._1,_l._63- col._2,_l._5
a second type of prior_art accessory was mounted to the helmet with clamps and therefore avoided the problem of damaging the helmet
such accessories had a separate problem however in that the clamped accessories extended down below the bottom_edge of the motorcycle_helmet creating a bulky object that would annoyingly strike a motorcyclists shoulder when the head was turned
this problem was exacerbated in other accessories in which the microphone_mount was attached to the electrical_plug_mount creating an even larger_object extending below the lower_edge of the helmet
id.at col._2,_ll._5-11

applicants claimed accessories that avoided these problems
their accessories attached to the lower_edge of the motorcycle_helmet by clamps with the microphone_mount and the electrical_plug_mount separately clamped to the helmet so that they were positioned above the lower_edge of the motorcycle_helmet
applicants accessories therefore did not damage the motorcycle *1363 helmet and did not protrude below the rim of the motorcycle_helmet

claims 1-3 of united states patent number 4,788,724` the ¡¬724_patent` which were also allowed in the reissued ¡¬525_patent read in pertinent part as follows 1
helmet_accessories for helmets of the type having an opening for viewing and receiving the head of a wearer the helmet opening having a lower_side_edge with adjacent inside and outside helmet surfaces above the lower_side_edge said helmet_accessories placing a microphone attached at the end of a boom proximate the helmet_wearers mouth ; and
a microphone_mount for attachment to an associated helmet said microphone_mount adapted to receive and secure an associated microphone_boom for placing the microphone proximate the wearers mouth ; and
a plug_mount for attachment to the associated helmet proximate said microphone_mount said plug_mount adapted to receive and secure an associated electrical_plug and provide for electrical connection from the electrical_plug to the microphone secured by the microphone_mount to the associated earphones located in the helmet and to associated audio_instruments located distal to the helmet ; both said microphone_mount and said plug_mount each including an attached clamp_portion engaging the lower_side_edge of the associated helmet said clamp_portion comprising an outside elongated jaw and an inside elongated jaw.. whereby said microphone_mount and plug_mount secure the microphone in position and provide for electrical connections in order that the wearer may utilize the associated microphone earphones and audio_instruments
2
the helmet_accessories as defined in claim 1 wherein said microphone_mount includes a microphone_boom_seat attached to said outside jaw said seat adapted to receive and secure the boom of a microphone and to provide means for wires associated with the microphone to exit said seat
3
the helmet_accessories as defined in claim 2 wherein said microphone_boom_seat is attached to said outside jaw proximate said second end said microphone_boom_seat thereby located proximate the outside surface of the helmet above the helmet edge
( emphasis added
claims 4-7 also at issue in this case depend from claims 1_and_3 and add additional limitations that are not relevant to this appeal

applicants later determined that their patent failed to claim the full subject_matter to which they were entitled and sought a reissue patent to more broadly claim their invention
in their reissue declaration applicants argued that their invention` properly includes within its scope an embodiment wherein the microphone_boom and the electrical_plug are both attached to a single element..' accordingly applicants asserted new_claims 15-20 in the reissue_proceedings that encompassed an accessory where the microphone_mount and plug_mount were clamped to the helmet by a single_pair of jaws
the examiner rejected these claims under 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
1 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
2 and 35 u.s.c.¡± 251
the examiner explained that the specification` fail [ ed ] to support the subject_matter of claims 15_through_20 directed to a microphone_boom and an electrical_plug_mounted on the same jaw pair'
the examiner further commented that these new_claims improperly` introduced new matter into the application' since` [ t ] he concept of both such_mounts occurring on a single_pair of jaws is not present in the original_patent'

*1364 in response applicants cancelled the rejected claims and proposed new_claims drafted in a means-plus-function_format
these claims broadly recited` gripping means' for attaching the microphone_mount and electrical_plug_mount to the motorcycle_helmet
after further amendment claims in this format were eventually allowed as claims 15-17 of the reissue patent.1 applicants patent was reissued as the ¡¬525_patent on february 1 1994 with new_claims 15-17 and with claims 1-14 essentially the same as in the ¡¬724_patent

harley-davidson began buying j & ms helmet_accessories in late 1987 or early 1988
these accessories were a commercial embodiment of the ¡¬724_patent and had separate microphone_boom mounts and electrical_plug_mounts that attached to the helmet via separate_clamps
harley-davidson continued to buy accessories from j & m until 1991
in the summer of 1989 however harley-davidson approached radio_sound about manufacturing accessories for resale by harley-davidson

harley-davidson and radio_sound produced their first accessories in 1990
when mounted these accessories extended below the lower_edge of the motorcycle_helmet
in 1997 radio_sound and harley-davidson began to manufacture and sell two new versions of their helmet_accessories model numbers 77147-big_token__98_and_77147__big_token -91c
these accessories have an integrated mount for the microphone_boom and the electrical_plug attach to the helmet with a single_clamp and do not extend below the lower_edge of the motorcycle_helmet
j & m claims that these accessories infringe its ¡¬525_patent

j & m brought suit against harley-davidson in november 1997 alleging infringement of claims 3-big_token__7_and_15__big_token -17 of the ¡¬525_patent2 harley-davidson responded that its microphone is non-infringing and that j & ms patent is invalid on numerous grounds
j & m then moved to preliminarily enjoin harley-davidson from selling its allegedly infringing accessories

the district_court denied j & ms motion finding that j & m had failed to establish a substantial likelihood of success on the merits for its allegations of infringement
j & m_corp. v. harley-davidson inc. no
civ 97-2353-phx-rcb d.ariz
may_14,_1998` j & m_i`
in reaching this conclusion the court construed the claims in dispute and determined that all of the claims require accessories having a separate mount for the microphone and for the electrical_plug each mount having its own clamp
because the accused devices have an integrated mount attached by a single_clamp the court found that they could not literally infringe
j & m_i at 8-15
the court then considered infringement by equivalents and concluded that j & m had not carried its burden of demonstrating infringement
id.at 15-19

j & m appealed the district_courts denial of its motion and we summarily affirmed with no written opinion
j & m_corp. v. harley-davidson inc. 185_f.3d_885_(fed.cir.1999) unpublished table decision

the case returned to the district_court and j & m moved for partial summary_judgment on harley-davidsons several affirmative *1365 defenses
harley-davidson responded with its own motion for summary_judgment of non-infringement
in addressing these motions the court focused on j & ms arguments for infringement by equivalents having disposed of j & ms other infringement arguments with its claim_construction rulings
these arguments for infringement by equivalents included assertions of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents with respect to all claims
these arguments further included assertions of literal_infringement of claims 15-17 contending that the means-plus-function_limitations in those claims are statutorily entitled to a literal_scope that includes` the corresponding structure.. described in the [ written description ] and equivalents thereof'
35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
6
the court had previously concluded that the` gripping means' limitation of claims 15-17 corresponds to the disclosed separate_clamps for the microphone_mount and the plug_mount
see j & m_i at 13-14
j & m argued however that an integrated mount attached by a clamp is an equivalent of the separate_clamps disclosed in the specification and that the` gripping means' limitation of claims 15-17 should be construed under 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
6 to read literally on the integrated mount of the defendants accessories
because it considered the analysis of infringement by ¡± 112 ?
6 equivalents of claims 15-17 and infringement under the doctrine of equivalents of claims 3-7 to be substantially the same the court considered these issues together

in doing so the court first rejected the defendants counter-arguments that the prosecution_history limited the scope of equivalents either as a matter of claim_construction or by prosecution_history_estoppel
the court next determined that the evidence for infringement by equivalents introduced by j & m including all three of its expert_reports was either inadmissible or defective

the court then applied the function-way-result test for equivalency
the court reasoned that the function of the two clamps in all of the claims at issue was to attach the accessories to the helmet without damaging the helmet and in a way that reduced the bulkiness of the accessory
id.at 52
separately clamping the microphone and plug_mounts reduced the bulkiness of the mounts
the court concluded that the single_clamp_design did not reduce the bulkiness of the accessory in the same way to produce the same result and that no reasonable juror could hold otherwise
id.at 53-54

as a result the court granted summary_judgment of non-infringement
j & m now appeals from this grant of summary_judgment arguing that the court abused its discretion in excluding j & ms expert_reports and that the court erred in holding that the accused accessories do not infringe by equivalents
harley-davidson_cross-appeals the courts holding that j & m is not barred from asserting infringement under the doctrine of equivalents by prosecution_history_estoppel

discussion
i
standard of review
we review a district_courts grant of summary_judgment de novo
ethicon endo-surgery inc. v. united states surgical corp. 149_f.3d_1309 1315 47_uspq2d_1272 1275 fed.cir.1998
in doing so we make an independent evaluation of whether the standards of summary_judgment have been met
conroy v. reebok int l ltd. 14_f.3d_1570 1575 29_uspq2d_1373 1377 fed.cir.1994
the evidence must be reviewed in a light most favorable to the non-movant and all reasonable inferences must be drawn in the non-movants favor
anderson v. liberty lobby inc. 477_u.s._242 255 106_s.ct._2505 91_l.ed.2d_202_(1986)
where a *1366 party` fails to make a showing sufficient to establish an element essential to that partys case and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial' summary_judgment must be entered against that party
celotex corp. v. catrett 477_u.s._317 322 106_s.ct._2548 91_l.ed.2d_265_(1986)

an infringement analysis requires two steps construction of the claims to determine their scope and meaning and comparison of the properly construed claims to the allegedly infringing device or method
cybor corp. v. fas techs. inc. 138_f.3d_1448 1454 46_uspq2d_1169 1172 fed.cir.1998 en banc
claim construction including the meaning and scope of any means-plus-function_limitations is a matter of law subject to de novo_review
lockheed martin corp. v. space sys./loral inc. 249_f.3d_1314 1323 58_uspq2d_1671 1677 fed.cir.2001
the comparison of claims to the accused device or method and the corresponding determination of infringement whether literal or under the doctrine of equivalents is a question of fact
tanabe seiyaku co. v. united states int l trade comm n 109_f.3d_726 731 41_uspq2d_1976 1981 fed.cir.1997

occasionally however` the issue of literal_infringement may be resolved with the step of claim_construction for upon correct claim_construction it may be apparent whether the accused device is within the claims'
multiform_desiccants inc. v. medzam 133_f.3d_1473 1476 45_uspq2d_1429 1431 fed.cir.1998
similarly the determination of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents may be limited as a matter of law
for example the scope of equivalents may be limited by the prosecution_history if the applicant narrowed claims to overcome prior_art
festo_corp. v. shoketsu_kinzoku_kogyo_kabushiki_co. 234_f.3d_558 585 56_uspq2d_1865 1886 fed.cir.2000 en banc
the scope of equivalents may also be limited by statements in the specification that disclaim coverage of certain subject_matter
dawn equip co. v. kentucky farms inc. 140_f.3d_1009 1016 46_uspq2d_1109 1114 fed.cir.1998
such limitations on the scope of equivalents are legal determinations which we review de novo

ii
infringement by equivalents
j & m asserts that the court erred in granting summary_judgment because there is at least a material issue of fact as to whether the accused single-mount devices infringe by equivalents the claims at issue
harley-davidsons integrated mount design j & m contends is a classic` one-for-two' equivalents scenario merely substituting a single mount and clamp for the dual mount and clamp structure literally required by the claims of the ¡¬525_patent
there is no significant difference j & m argues between these two designs
according to j & m the district_court incorrectly determined that having two separate mounts served the function of reducing bulkiness

harley-davidson responds that j & m has failed to explain how dual clamps are equivalent to the single_clamp employed by the accused devices
in contrast harley-davidson claims that it has conclusively demonstrated that the two-clamp_design claimed in the ¡¬525_patent is distinct from the one-clamp_design of the accused devices
harley-davidson further argues that j & m is precluded as a matter of law from arguing a scope of equivalents that encompasses its single-clamp_accessories
harley-davidson argues that the prosecution_history establishes that the specification does not support claim coverage of a single_clamp_embodiment
therefore harley-davidson argues a single_clamp_embodiment can not be an equivalent
*1367 moreover because these claims were narrowed during prosecution to more particularly claim the dual clamp limitation it argues that prosecution_history_estoppel_bars_j & m from asserting that a single_clamp_design infringes by equivalents

we agree with harley-davidson that as a matter of law the claims at issue can not encompass the accused single-clamp_accessories

a
claims 15-17
we first consider j & ms allegations of infringement by equivalents with respect to claims 15-17 since these claims which employ means-plus-function language raise issues that are distinct from those concerning claims 3-7
the means-plus-function_limitation in claims 15-17-' gripping means' 3-corresponds in the specification to a structure with two clamps one for the microphone_mount and one for the electrical_plug_mount
the specification does not disclose any alternative gripping structure and in view of this specification disclosure and disclaimer of the single mount accessory in the prior_art and in view of the prosecution_history we agree with the district_court that these claims are limited to a dual_clamp_structure
j & m argues however that the single_clamp of the accused accessories is equivalent to the dual_clamp_structure required by this means-plus-function_limitation either for the purposes of 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
6 or alternatively under the doctrine of equivalents
we conclude that j & m is not entitled to such a broad_scope of equivalents

1
literal infringement equivalency under ¡± 112 ?
6
we first reject j & ms argument that the gripping means limitation of claims 15-17 literally covers the single_clamp_structure of the accused devices
the literal_scope of a properly construed means-plus-function_limitation does not extend to all means for performing a certain function
rather the scope of such claim language is sharply limited to the structure disclosed in the specification and its equivalents
moreover the extent of equivalents must be interpreted in light of the disclosure of the invention in the specification as a whole as well as the prosecution_history
biodex corp. v. loredan biomedical inc. 946_f.2d_850 863 20_uspq2d_1252 1262 fed.cir.1991 ; medtronic inc. v. intermedics inc. 799_f.2d_734 742 230_uspq_641 645 fed.cir.1986 ; alpex computer corp. v. nintendo co. 102_f.3d_1214 1220 40_uspq2d_1667 1673 fed.cir.1996 holding that the prosecution_history is relevant to determining the meaning of means-plus-function_limitations ; signtech usa v. vutek inc. 174_f.3d_1352 1357 50_uspq2d_1372 1375 fed.cir.1999 holding that a means-plus-function_limitation did not cover structure disclaimed in the specification
both the prosecution_history and the specification of the ¡¬525_patent limit the scope of ¡± 112 ?
6 equivalents for the` gripping means' limitation of claims 15-17 precluding coverage of a single_clamp accessory

the prosecution_history conclusively establishes that the single_clamp_structure of the accused devices can not be an equivalent of the dual clamp_embodiment disclosed in the ¡¬525_patent specification
as *1368 noted above in advancing new_claims 15-17 in the reissue_proceedings j & m explicitly sought coverage of a single_clamp_embodiment of its invention
the examiner rejected these broadly drafted claims determining that they were not` drawn to the invention disclosed in the original_patent' because` [ t ] he concept of both such_mounts occurring on a single_pair of jaws is not present in the original_patent'
faced with this rejection j & m acquiesced canceling the claims and substituting new_claims drafted in the means-plus-function_format

the examiners rejection coupled with j & ms acquiescence and substitution of narrower claims establishes that a single-clamp_embodiment is not supported by the written description
therefore the scope of the claims can not include a single-clamp_embodiment
multiform_desiccants 133 f.3d at 1479 45 uspq2d at 1434 ; in re dossel 115_f.3d_942 946 42_uspq2d_1881 1884-85 fed.cir.1997
j & m is statutorily entitled only to claims that encompass embodiments of the` gripping means' disclosed in the specification and their equivalents

the specification of the ¡¬525_patent further establishes that the single_clamp_structure can not be an equivalent of the dual clamp
in the section entitled` description of the related art' a single_clamp_structure is described as a flaw of prior_art_accessories
specifically the specification states this is especially a problem when the electrical wires.. attach by means of a plug_mounted to the microphone_mount such as to enlarge the portion of the mount residing below the helmet lip and present a still larger_object for striking the helmet_wearers shoulder when his head turns
'525_patent at col._2,_ll._14-20
j & m can not now extend the scope of its claims to include this disclaimed structure
see sofamor danek group inc. v. depuy-motech inc. 74_f.3d_1216 1220 37_uspq2d_1529 1531 fed.cir.1996

therefore the literal_scope of the` gripping means' limitation of claims 15-17 does not include the single_clamp_structure of the accused accessories

2
equivalency under the doctrine of equivalents
in view of the prosecution_history we also conclude that the gripping means limitation of claims 15-17 can not include a range of equivalents under the doctrine of equivalents that extends to single_clamp_accessories
j & m submitted the means-plus-function claims 15-17 in response to the examiners rejection of claims broadly covering both single_clamp and dual_clamp_accessories
the allowed claims 15-17 which we have determined are limited to dual_clamp_accessories are narrower with respect to this limitation
therefore prosecution_history_estoppel_bars_j & m from asserting coverage of the accused single_clamp_accessories under the doctrine of equivalents
see mycogen plant science inc. v. monsanto co. 261_f.3d_1345 1350 59_uspq2d_1852 1855-56 fed.cir.2001 holding that the rule set forth in festo_corp. v. shoketsu_kinzoku_kogyo_kabushiki_co. 234_f.3d_558 56_uspq2d_1865 fed.cir.2000 applies when a rejected claim is canceled and replaced by a narrowing claim

b
claims 3-7
j & m asserts infringement under the doctrine of equivalents with respect to claims 3-7
again we conclude that j & m is not entitled to such a broad_scope of equivalents

structure expressly disclaimed in the specification of course can not be considered an equivalent under the doctrine of equivalents
*1369 dawn equip. 140 f.3d at 1016 46 uspq2d at 1114 ; spectra corp. v. lutz 839_f.2d_1579 1582 5_uspq_2 d 1867 1869 fed.cir.1988
as noted above the specification disclaims coverage of a single_clamp_structure as a flaw of prior_art_accessories
moreover while applicants were aware of the possibility of placing the microphone_boom and electrical_plug_mount on a single_clamp they dismissed such an approach and expressly described and claimed accessories in which the boom and plug were separately mounted
j & m can not now overlook this deliberate decision and reclaim this disclaimed subject_matter through the doctrine of equivalents

because we have determined that j & m is not entitled to the asserted range of equivalents with respect to claims 3-7 we need not consider harley-davidsons additional arguments with respect to prosecution_history_estoppel

iii
the exclusion of j & ms expert reports
j & m argues that the court abused its discretion in rejecting all three of its expert_reports on the issue of infringement by equivalents
because we have concluded that as a matter of law j & ms arguments for infringement by equivalents must fail we need not consider this issue

conclusion
j & m is not entitled to a scope of equivalents with respect to claims 3-7 or claims 15-17 that encompasses harley davidsons single-clamp_accessories
the summary_judgment of the district_court is affirmed

affirmed
