opinion
*1437 rader circuit_judge
halliburton company halliburton sued schlumberger technology corporation schlumberger for infringement of u.s._patent_nos._4388,529529_patent 4,409,481481_patent and 4,424,444444_patent
these patents embrace tools and techniques for neutron_logging of oil wells
specifically the patents disclose use of high_energy_neutrons to measure the properties of underground geological_formations

the united_states_district_court for the southern_district of texas determined that halliburton did not disclose important prior_art to the patent and trademark office pto during the application process
hence the district_court found halliburton had engaged in inequitable_conduct
the district_court refused to enforce halliburtons patents and awarded schlumberger $ 3,375,000.00 in attorney fees and expenses
see halliburton_co. v. schlumberger_technology_corp. 722_f.supp._324 12_uspq2d_1765_(s.d.tex.1989)
halliburton appeals from this judgment and order
this court reverses

background
oil producers use well logging to detect oil in geological_formations
this process involves lowering a complex instrument into a well_borehole
as the logging tool moves down the borehole it measures or logs the properties of the surrounding geological_formation

in neutron well logging the instrument emits high_energy_neutrons 14 million electron_volts as it descends into the borehole
the neutrons collide with the nuclei of atoms in the borehole and the surrounding earth
these collisions generate high-energy inelastic gamma rays
these collisions also quickly drain energy from the neutrons
as the neutrons slow down or moderate they become thermal_neutrons 0.025 electron_volts
the nuclei of surrounding atoms capture these thermal_neutrons
when this capture or neutron_decay occurs the capturing atoms emit capture_gamma_rays

the logging tool detects these capture_gamma_rays
a count of capture_gamma_rays reveals the neutron_population and the rate of neutron_decay
different materials capture neutrons at different rates
thus measuring the decay of thermal_neutrons tells much about the composition of formations around the borehole
oil for instance captures thermal_neutrons at a different rate than saltwater
figure 1 of the481_patent depicts the logging tool

?
*1438 during decay the thermal_neutron_population changes in proportion to its size
therefore exponential_equations express these neutron_decay_rates
these equations express scientific principles governing exponential growth and decay.1 the equations describe the results of any process in which a population-in this case thermal_neutrons-changes at a rate proportional to its size
after measurement of the capture_gamma_rays by the logging instrument these equations express the neutron_decay_rate

early in its use however neutron_decay logging presented a major problem
the well casing itself made up of metal and cement absorbs neutrons and emits gamma rays
an accurate logging technique therefore must distinguish between gamma ray feedback from the well casing and feedback from the surrounding geological_formations
in addition water oil gas or air in the borehole may capture thermal_neutrons and further distort the logging measurements
early thermal neutron_decay tools could not account for decay occurring within the borehole itself
to compensate for this limitation these early tools assumed that decay within the borehole occurred faster than in the formation

under this assumption the early logging methods delayed gamma ray measurement for an instant after a high-energy burst to allow borehole nuclei to capture thermal_neutrons
these early methods arbitrarily attributed all measurements after the delay to the formation
this technique became known as` timing out the bore-hole'
because borehole conditions vary this technique was fraught with uncertainty

appellants patents
the claims at issue cover techniques and tools to measure capture_gamma_rays
capture gamma rays represent the thermal_neutron_population after the inelastic gamma rays associated with fast_neutrons have all dissipated
the patents describe pulse-moderation neutron systems
these systems generate short bursts or pulses of fast_neutrons about once per millisecond a thousand times per second
during and after each short burst of neutrons the fast_neutrons rapidly moderate into thermal_neutrons
the thermal_neutron_population gradually declines as the surrounding atoms capture neutrons and emit capture_gamma_rays

claim 1 of the444_patent is representative of the technology involved in each of the halliburton_patents a method for simultaneously measuring the thermal_neutron_decay_time of materials in and about a well_borehole comprising the steps of generating in a well_borehole a relatively short duration discrete burst of fast_neutrons which are rapidly moderated by interaction with nuclei of materials in the borehole and surrounding earth_formations and slowed down to thermal energy creating a thermal_neutron_population in the borehole and surrounding earth_formations ; detecting in the borehole radiations representative of the thermal_neutron_population in the borehole and surrounding earth_formations in at least four time_intervals subsequent to said burst of fast_neutrons and generating at least four count signals representative of said thermal_neutron_population during said at least four time_intervals ; and
combining said at least four count signals according to a predetermined relationship to simultaneously separate the borehole and formation decay components *1439 and to derive at least two measurement signals representative of the thermal_neutron_decay_time of the borehole medium and the earth formation medium in the vicinity of the borehole

the halliburton_inventions eliminate the imprecise` timing out' technique
instead the inventions measure capture_gamma_rays at four distinct time_intervals
halliburtons method then uses the two-exponential_equation to separate the borehole readings from the readings in the surrounding formation

in essence the halliburton_inventions assume the two-exponential_equation represents mathematically the total neutron_population at any particular time
this equation has four unknowns.2 after making four gamma ray measurements at different times the halliburton method solves the equations for the four unknowns
two of these values provide the neutron_decay feedback for the geological_formations around the borehole
the other two values provide the neutron_decay information for the borehole itself
the calculated value for each of the unknowns ensures that the resulting two-exponential_equation matches the neutron_populations at the four different time_gates

by taking four measurements to obtain four data_points and then using a computer program to derive the unknowns from the data_points the patented inventions omit the` timing out' technique of the prior_art
the inventions thus facilitate a more reliable measurement of thermal neutron_decay in the geological_formation
they also reduce the demand for continuous neutron bursts and take capture gamma radiation readings sooner
these measurements therefore encompass practically the entire thermal neutron_decay_curve
finally the patents teach mathematical processing of those measurements to determine the thermal neutron characteristics of the borehole and the formation

during the patent application process appellant did not disclose to the pto any prior_art reference
however examiner_willis cited six patents directed to pulse-moderation systems
at trial the district_court determined that appellant should have disclosed seven other patents of which it was aware
the district_court determined that this failure to disclose constituted inequitable_conduct which made the patents unenforceable

discussion
the doctrine of inequitable_conduct requires a trial_court to undertake a two-step analysis
the trial_court must discern whether the withheld references satisfy a threshold_level of materiality
the court must also determine whether the applicants conduct satisfies a threshold showing of intent to mislead.3 see j.p._stevens & co. v. lex_tex ltd. 747_f.2d_1553 1559-60 223_uspq_1089 1092 fed.cir.1984 cert
denied 474_u.s._822 106_s.ct._73 88_l.ed.2d_60_(1985)
these initial determinations are questions of fact which this court reviews under a clearly erroneous standard
next assuming satisfaction of the thresholds the trial_court must balance materiality and intent
under sea indus. inc. v. dacor corp. 833_f.2d_1551 1559 4_uspq2d_1772 1777 fed.cir.1987
the more_material the omission the less culpable the intent required and vice versa
n.v. akzo v. e.i
dupont de nemours 810_f.2d_1148 1153 1_uspq2d_1704 1708 fed.cir.1987
the trial_court has discretion *1440 to determine inequitable_conduct
this court reviews that discretionary determination under an abuse of discretion standard

denied 490_u.s._1067 109_s.ct._2068 104_l.ed.2d_633_(1989)

materiality
pto rule 56 is the appropriate starting point in determining the threshold_level of materiality
this broad standard most closely delineates how an applicant ought to conduct business with the pto
american hoist & derrick co. v. sowa & sons inc. 725_f.2d_1350 1363 220_uspq_763 773 fed.cir.1984
information is material if there is` substantial likelihood that a reasonable examiner would consider it important in deciding whether to allow the application to issue as a patent'
37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 1989

however a patentee has no obligation to disclose an otherwise material reference if the reference is cumulative or less_material than those already before the examiner
see specialty_composites v. cabot corp. 845_f.2d_981 992 6_uspq2d_1601 1609 fed.cir.1988
therefore if the references found by examiner_willis more closely related to the halliburton_applications than the uncited art halliburton did not engage in inequitable_conduct
with these standards in mind this court reviews the district_courts materiality findings
the non-disclosed prior_art was u.s. patent no._4326,129 to neufeld four texaco_patents u.s._patent_nos._3930,152 3,940,611 3,940,613 and 3,979,300 and two so-called skip-a-beat patents u.s._patent_nos._3733 486_and_4002,904 also to texaco
examiner_willis cited six references
the most pertinent of these were u.s._patent_nos._4122 338_and_4152,590 both to smith

the cited references
halliburtons method of measuring directly the neutron_decay for the borehole and formation is a direct extension of the methods in the cited references
both of the smith_patents assume the existence of the mathematical relationship expressed by the two-exponential_equation
the smith_patents however measure the neutron_population at only two time_gates
thus the smith methods can calculate only two of the four unknowns in the two-exponential_equation
they must rely on other information to estimate the remaining two unknowns

the smith590_patent relies on the timing-out technique
the590_patent thus assumes that the value of the exponential component due to borehole decay will eventually reach zero
this assumption reduces the two-exponential_equation to a single_exponential_equation with only two unknowns
thus by measuring at two separate time_gates the smith patent obtains two data_points from which it computes the two unknowns due to the formation

the smith338_patent uses the salinity of the borehole water to estimate the two unknowns attributable to the borehole
the338_patent bases its estimation from prior knowledge of how salt water responds to neutron irradiation
having estimated the two unknowns the two-exponential_equation becomes a single_exponential_equation with two unknowns
measurement at two time_gates permits calculation of the unknowns based on two data_points

the district_court erroneously dismissed the cited references as less_material because they relied on the timing-out technique
the smith_patents however like the halliburton_patents assume the two-exponential_equation and describe a method to calculate the unknowns related to the formation component of the decay
in the art of neutron well logging the smith_patents were highly material to halliburtons applications
the most pertinent prior_art in the field was thus before the examiner
nonetheless schlumberger asserts that halliburton remained obliged to disclose the uncited references to the examiner

the neufeld patent
the district_court emphasized appellants failure to disclose the neufeld_patent
the neufeld_patent recognizes that the exponential *1441 equation derived from both the borehole and the formation the two-exponential_equation expresses total thermal neutron_decay
neufeld however reaches these results in a very different_way than appellants claimed inventions and the cited references

neufeld derives its neutron_decay_results mathematically
in practice the neufeld device discharges random bursts of neutrons into the borehole
a detector measures the entire gamma ray feedback
by comparing the detector output with the neutron burst neufeld then computes a formation and borehole decay_rate from the continuous feedback

the patent claims at issue on the other hand measure directly the neutron_decay_results
the inventions emit pulses at regular_intervals
between each pulse the claimed inventions measure the decay_rate directly

the district_court found that both appellants patent claims and the neufeld_patent recognize exponential relationships in deriving the decay_rate
based on this similarity the district_court concluded that neufeld was highly material to examination of appellants patents
the district_court however did not appreciate the significance of the differences between neufeld and the claims at issue which make neufeld less_material than the cited references

when weighing whether uncited prior_art is more_material than that before the examiner a trial_court considers similarities and differences between prior_art and the claims of the patent
in making this determination the trial_court must consider portions of prior_art references which teach away from the claimed invention
see bausch & lomb inc. v. barnes-hind/hydrocurve inc. 796_f.2d_443 448-49 230_uspq_416 420 fed.cir.1986 cert
denied 484_u.s._823 108_s.ct._85 98_l.ed.2d_47_(1987)

both neufeld and appellants claimed inventions recognize the two-exponential_equation
this equation simply expresses mathematically an axiom of exponential_decay
thus the two-exponential_equation is not a critical component of either neufeld or appellants claimed inventions but rather a scientific truism acknowledged by both
a reasonable patent examiner would not consider neufeld important merely because both neufeld and appellants patents acknowledge this scientific equation

the district_court nonetheless found that the` principal invention of the patents-in-suit is their method for measuring and simultaneously decomposing the entire neutron_decay_curve.. by a two-exponential relationship'
halliburton 722 f.supp.at 333 12 uspq2d at 1772
this finding is clearly erroneous
appellant claims a method of measuring directly the formation and borehole components of the decay_curve between regular neutron pulses in four time_gates
by misconstruing the crux of appellants claimed inventions the district_court also missed the significance of the differences from the neufeld reference

the district_court itself noted these substantial differences between neufelds and appellants subject matter
for instance neufeld depends on continuous random energy pulses and achieves a 50 % radiation use rate
appellant uses short discrete neutron bursts at regular_intervals having a radiation use rate of 1.5 %
neufeld continuously detects gamma rays between random pulses
appellant detects gamma rays in four distinct time_gates after each pulse
neufeld performs a correlation calculation to derive a decay_curve from both inelastic and capture gamma ray data
appellant directly measures separate borehole and formation components of the decay_curve using only capture_gamma_rays
halliburton 722 f.supp.at 334 12 uspq2d at 1772-73

these significant differences distinguish the neufeld disclosure and appellants claimed inventions
comparing these differences with the similarities leads to the conclusion that neufeld is less_material than the cited references
in sum while in the same field of endeavor neufeld was far less_material to appellants applications *1442 than the cited references
neufeld disclosed a technique that emitted neutrons and measured capture_gamma_rays very differently from that claimed by appellants patents
therefore no disclosure_obligation attached to neufeld

the texaco patents
the district_court also based its inequitable_conduct finding on appellants failure to disclose the four texaco_patents
the texaco_patents also recognize the two-exponential_equation
they also disclose a way to get both the borehole and formation thermal_neutron_decay_times
however the texaco_patents like neufeld use a method different from appellants claimed inventions to get these results
therefore the texaco_patents are also less_material than the cited references

the texaco disclosures show the continuous emission of fast_neutrons
these continuous emissions vary harmonically as a function of time
texaco also modulates these emissions at three different frequencies
each frequency generates both inelastic and thermal gamma rays
these rays in turn generate a phase coherent thermal_neutron_population
a detector continuously measures the relative phase angle of these neutron_populations
the tangents of these phase angles show the neutron_decay time for both the borehole and formation

texacos method is unlike that disclosed in appellants patents or in the cited references
appellants claimed inventions measure different feedback data in a different_way
the texaco_patents therefore are not more_material to appellants patents than the cited references

in determining that the texaco_patents were material the district_court noted that appellants patent attorney mr
beard used the611_patent as a template in drafting the444 application
however because the texaco_patents are less_material than the cited references mr
beards alleged use of the611_patent as a template for the background portions of the444 specification does not raise its level of materiality

the skip-a-beat patents
the skip-a-beat patents describe a method for eliminating inaccurate gamma radiation readings originating from the neutron pulse generator foreign material or the detector crystal
several claims of appellants patents include a step which uses this background correction method along with many other limitations on which appellant based patentability
the inclusion in claims of a step that is known to the art does not require the applicant to disclose under pain of inequitable_conduct references that describe each known step
the inventors did not represent that they invented this step which is included in only some of the claims
see generally stevenson v. international trade comm n 612_f.2d_546 555 67_ccpa_109 204_uspq_276 284 1979
in any event because the skip-a-beat patents are less_material than the cited references no disclosure_obligation attached

intent
inequitable conduct requires an intent to act inequitably
fmc_corp. v. manitowoc co. 835_f.2d_1411 1415 5_uspq2d_1112 1115 fed.cir.1987
materiality of an undisclosed reference does not presume an intent to deceive
allen organ co. v. kimball int l inc. 839_f.2d_1556 1567 5_uspq2d_1769 1778 fed.cir.1988
further a mere showing that references having some degree of materiality were not disclosed does not establish inequitable_conduct
fmc_corp. 835 f.2d at 1411 5 uspq2d at 1115

this record contains no direct evidence that appellant intended to mislead the pto by withholding references
such direct evidence of intent to mislead is often absent
rohm & haas co. v. crystal chem co. 722_f.2d_1556 1571 220_uspq_289 301 fed.cir.1983
the district_court concluded however that appellant was grossly negligent in failing to disclose the withheld material references
from this finding of gross_negligence the district_court inferred intent

gross_negligence does not of itself justify an inference of intent to deceive
*1443 kingsdown 863 f.2d at 876 9 uspq2d at 1392
this court has clarified that negligent conduct can support an inference of intent only when` viewed in light of all the evidence including evidence indicative of good faith' the conduct is culpable enough` to require a finding of intent to deceive'
id

appellant admits awareness of the withheld references
appellants counsel however did not consider the references material
as discussed above the withheld references obtain the neutron_decay_curve in an entirely different_way than disclosed by halliburtons patents
while all acknowledge the two-exponential_equation the equation is not part of the claims in any of the patents
in light of these facts mr
beards assertion that he did not intend to mislead is objectively reasonable

the district_court cited various actions by halliburton or its representatives in support of its holding that halliburton withheld the references with intent to deceive
with respect to neufeld the district_court held that beards involvement with the prosecution of the patents-in-suit imposed an obligation to disclose neufeld
the court held that beards failure to disclose neufeld constituted gross_negligence because` a reasonable person in beards position should have known of the materiality of neufeld and disclosed it to the pto'
halliburton 722 f.supp.at 336 12 uspq2d at 1774
the trial_court further cited halliburtons attempt due to fear of infringement to purchase neufeld contemporaneous with the prosecution of the patents-in-suit
id.at 336-37 12 uspq2d at 1774
the district_court held that halliburtons gross_negligence justified finding an intent to deceive
id.at 337 12 uspq2d at 1774

as support for finding intent to deceive with respect to the texaco_patents the district_court cited halliburtons belief that the texaco_patents were material and that its tmd tool infringed the texaco_patents
the district_court further cited beards alleged use of the611_patent as a template in drafting the444_patent and the examiners failure to reference any prior_art that disclosed the key features of halliburtons inventions
id.at 337-38 12 uspq2d at 1775
the district_court relied on other similar factors with respect to the skip-a-beat patents to find intentional non-disclosure
id.at 340 12 uspq2d at 1777

this court need not decide whether the factors relied upon by the district_court tend to support a finding of carelessness or gross_negligence in prosecuting halliburtons applications or whether they simply show halliburtons appreciation of the narrow technological basis of its claimed inventions
see in re jerabek 789_f.2d_886 891 229_uspq_530 533 fed.cir.1986
as kingsdown made abundantly clear gross_negligence alone does not compel the inference of intent to deceive
gross_negligence can not elevate itself by its figurative boot-straps to an intent to mislead based on the identical factors used to establish gross_negligence in the first instance unless all the facts and circumstances indicate sufficient culpability
an applicants conduct in its entirety must` manifest [ ] a sufficiently culpable state of mind to warrant a determination that it was inequitable'
consolidated aluminum corp. v. foseco int l ltd. 910_f.2d_804 809 15_uspq2d_1481 1484 fed.cir.1990

moreover as stated above the cited references were more pertinent to the halliburton_applications than were the withheld references
halliburton had no obligation to disclose cumulative_references
specialty_composites 845 f.2d at 992 6 uspq2d at 1609 ; j.p._stevens 747 f.2d at 1559-60 223 uspq at 1092
halliburton did not act with culpable_intent
halliburton could not have acted with culpable_intent with respect to cumulative_references
the district_courts finding to the contrary is clearly erroneous

conclusion
the record does not support a finding of intent to mislead
nor does the record support a finding that the withheld references *1444 were more_material than the cited references
the district_courts materiality and intent findings are clearly erroneous
therefore no balance of materiality and intent is necessary
this court concludes that appellant did not engage in inequitable_conduct
