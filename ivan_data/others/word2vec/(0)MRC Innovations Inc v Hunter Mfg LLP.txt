background
mrc is the owner by assignment of both patents-in-suit
the ¡¬488_patent claims an ornamental_design for a football_jersey for a dog while the ¡¬487_patent does the same for a baseball_jersey as shown below

?
?
*1329 mark_cohen is the named inventor of both patents ; he is the principal shareholder of mrc and assigned his rights in both patents to that company
appellee hunter manufacturing llp is a retailer of licensed sports consumer products including pet_jerseys
prior to september 9 2009 hunter purchased pet_jerseys for dogs from mark_cohen through companies with which he was affiliated
for example cohen supplied hunter with a` v2' football_jersey through the stephen gould corporation and through fun-in-games inc.` fig'
similarly cohen supplied hunter through fig with a green pet_jersey bearing a philadelphia eagles logo which hunter then sold through third-party retailers such as wal-mart and petsmart prior to july_30,_2009
the v2 and eagles_jerseys are depicted below

?
*1330 cohen asserts that in 2009 he designed another pet_jersey known as the` v3' jersey which would later become the subject of the ¡¬488_patent
hunter began purchasing the v3_jersey from fig sometime after september 8 2009
on september 8 2010 cohen filed a patent application for both the v3_jersey and the baseball equivalent that would later become the subject of the ¡¬ 487 patent

in december 2010 cohen informed hunter that he no longer intended to do business with hunter because hunter was having difficulty making payments
hunter then sought proposals from other companies to manufacture and supply it with pet_jerseys like the v3
ultimately hunter contracted with another supplier appellee cdi_international inc. to supply hunter with pet_jerseys

both patents-in-suit eventually issued on march_15,_2011

mrc filed suit against both hunter and cdi for willful infringement of both patents
the district_court granted summary_judgment in favor of hunter and cdi on the grounds that both patents are invalid as obvious under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a

discussion
this court reviews a district_courts grant of summary_judgment under the law of the regional circuit
grober v. mako prods. inc. 686_f.3d_1335 1344 fed.cir.2012
the sixth circuit reviews a district *1331 courts grant of summary_judgment de novo
braun v. ann arbor charter twp. 519_f.3d_564 569 6th cir.2008
summary_judgment is appropriate if viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party the movant shows that there is no genuine_dispute as to any material_fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law

i
the ¡¬488_patent
the district_court concluded that the ¡¬488_patent would have been obvious in view of several prior_art pet_jerseys
mrc now appeals that determination

obviousness is a question of law that is reviewed de novo based on underlying factual questions that are reviewed for clear error following a bench trial
honeywell int l inc. v. united states 609_f.3d_1292 1297 fed.cir.2010
the underlying factual inquiries include 1 the scope and content of the prior_art ; 2 the level of ordinary_skill in the art ; 3 the differences between the claimed invention and the prior_art ; and 4 objective evidence of non-obviousness
graham v. john deere co. of kan. city 383_u.s._1 17 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966)
summary_judgment of obviousness is appropriate if` the content of the prior_art the scope of the patent claim and the level of ordinary_skill in the art are not in material dispute and the obviousness of the claim is apparent in light of these factors'
trimed inc. v. stryker corp. 608_f.3d_1333 1341 fed.cir.2010 citing ksr int l co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 427 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007)

in the context of design_patents`the ultimate inquiry under section 103 is whether the claimed design would have been obvious to a designer of ordinary_skill who designs articles of the type involved
`` titan_tire_corp. v. case new holland inc. 566_f.3d_1372 1380-81 fed.cir.2009 quoting durling v. spectrum furniture co. 101_f.3d_100 103 fed.cir.1996
to answer this question a court must first determine` whether one of ordinary_skill would have combined teachings of the prior_art to create the same_overall_visual_appearance as the claimed design'
durling 101 f.3d at 103
that inquiry involves a two-step process
first the court must identify` a single reference a something in existence the design_characteristics of which are basically the same as the claimed design
`` id
( quoting in re rosen 673_f.2d_388 391 ccpa 1982
the` basically the same' test requires consideration of the` visual_impression created by the patented_design as a whole'
id
we have noted that` the trial court judge may determine almost instinctively whether the two designs create basically the same_visual_impression' but` must communicate the reasoning behind that decision'
id

once the primary_reference is found other` secondary' references` may be used to modify it to create a design that has the same_overall_visual_appearance as the claimed design'
id
these secondary_references must be`so related [ to the primary_reference ] that the appearance of certain_ornamental_features in one would suggest the application of those features to the other

( quoting in re_borden 90_f.3d_1570 1575 fed.cir.1996 alteration in original

a
primary reference
the district_court used the` eagles' pet_jersey as the` primary_reference' *1332 under step one of the durling analysis
mrc 921 f.supp.2d at 809
mrc argues that this was legally erroneous because there are significant differences between the eagles_jersey and the patented_design of the ¡¬488_patent
specifically there are three differences 1 the patented_design has a v-neck collar where the eagles_jersey has a round neck ; 2 the patented_design contains an interlock_fabric panel on the side portion of the design rather than mesh ; and 3 the patented_design contains additional_ornamental_surge stitching on the rear portion of the jersey
mrc argues that the district_court overlooked these differences by focusing on the claimed design at` too high a level of abstraction'
high_point design llc v. buyers direct inc. 730_f.3d_1301 1314 fed.cir.2013 citing apple inc. v. samsung elecs co. ltd. 678_f.3d_1314 1331 fed.cir.2012
if the district_court had translated the claimed design into a verbal_description as required by high_point mrc insists it would have concluded that neither the eagles_jersey nor any other prior_art_reference contained design_characteristics that were` basically the same' as the claimed design

as an initial matter it is true that the district_court did not expressly undertake to translate the claimed design into a verbal_description
however high_point makes clear that the purpose of requiring district_courts to describe the claimed design in words is so that the parties and appellate courts can discern the trial courts reasoning in identifying a primary_reference
see id
( citing durling 101 f.3d at 103
it is entirely clear from the district_courts opinion what it considered to be the relevant design_characteristics of the ¡¬488_patent ed design

first the district_court pointed out three key similarities between the claimed design and the eagles_jersey an opening at the collar_portion for the head two openings and sleeves stitched to the body of the jersey for limbs and a body portion on which a football logo is applied
mrc 921 f.supp.2d at 809
if the district_courts analysis had ended there it might indeed have failed to meet the high_point verbal_description requirement
however the district_court went on to point out two additional similarities between the two designs first the eagles_jersey is made` primarily of a mesh and interlock_fabric' ; and second it contains at least some ornamental_surge_stitching-both features found in the ¡¬488 claimed design
id
the district_court also went on to acknowledge the three major differences between the two designs that are enumerated above
see id
taking all of those things together the at least five design_characteristics that the claimed design shares with the eagles_jersey and three design_characteristics that differ from it the district_court painted a clear picture of the claimed design
the district_court did far more than merely ask whether the eagles_jersey disclosed the` general concept' of a pet_jersey ; it thoroughly considered the` distinctivevisual appearances of the reference and the claimed design'
apple 678 f.3d at 1332 quoting durling 101 f.3d at 104
thus the district_court did not err by failing to provide an express_verbal_description of the claimed design ; rather it described the claimed design in the context of comparing it to the prior_art

nor did the district_court err in finding that the design_characteristics of the ¡¬488 design created` basically the same' overall_visual_impression as the eagles_jersey prior_art_reference
as the district_court noted both designs contain the same overall shape similar fabric and *1333 ornamental_surge_stitching
that there are slight differences in the precise placement of the interlock_fabric and the ornamental_stitching does not defeat a claim of obviousness ; if the designs were identical no obviousness_analysis would be required.1 indeed we have permitted prior_art_designs to serve as` primary_references' when their differences are as great or greater than the differences in this case
see jore corp. v. kouvato inc. 117_fed.appx._761 763 fed.cir.2005 finding prior_art drill bit to be a primary_reference despite containing a smooth cylindrical shaft rather than the grooved hexagonal shaft of the claimed design ; in re_nalbandian 661_f.2d_1214 1217-18 ccpa 1981 finding tweezer design obvious in light of prior_art_reference that contained vertical rather than horizontal fluting and straight rather than curved pincers2

apple 678_f.3d_1314 on which mrc relies is not to the contrary
there we faulted the district_court for finding that the prior_art fidler_tablet could serve as a primary_reference to the patented tablet design
id.at 1330-31
however in that case we noted` substantial differences in the overall_visual_appearance between the patented_design and the fidler reference' and described no fewer than six differences between the two products
id
among other things the fidler_tablet was asymmetrical where the patented tablet was symmetrical ; it contained a sunken screen that created a` picture frame' effect rather than the visual_impression of` an unbroken slab of glass extending from edge to edge on the front side of the [ patented ] tablet' ; and it contained two card-like projections and an indentation on its sides rather than the smooth sides of the claimed design
id
these differences rendered the fidler_tablet significantly different in overall_visual_appearance from the patented_design ; the same can not be said of the ¡¬ 488 patented_design and the eagles_jersey which we agree are` basically the same
`` 3

*1334 b
secondary references
after concluding that the eagles_jersey could be a` primary_reference' the district_court determined that the v2_jersey and another reference known as the` sporty_k9' jersey were` so related to the primary_reference' that they could serve as` secondary_references' that would motivate the skilled_artisan to make the claimed design
mrc 921 f.supp.2d at 809

the district_court found that both jerseys suggested the use of a v-neck pattern and non-mesh fabric on the side panels-the first two differences described above
mrc argues that the district_court erred by failing to explain why a skilled_artisan would have chosen to incorporate those features of the v2 and sporty_k9 jerseys with the eagles_jersey

we disagree
it is true that` [ i ] n order for secondary_references to be considered.. there must be some suggestion in the prior_art to modify the basic design with features from the secondary_references'
in re_borden 90 f.3d at 1574
however we have explained this requirement to mean that` the teachings of prior_art_designs may be combined only when the designs areso related that the appearance of certain_ornamental_features in one would suggest the application of those features to the other
`` id.at 1575 quoting in re glavas 43_ccpa_797 230_f.2d_447 450 1956
in other_words it is the mere_similarity in appearance that itself provides the suggestion that one should apply certain features to another design.4

in re_borden also discussed what is required for a reference to be considered sufficiently` related' for that test to apply
there we noted that the secondary_references were` closely akin' to the claimed design and relied heavily on the fact that` the two missing design elements [ were ] not taken from unrelated references but [ were ] found in other dual-chamber containers'
id
thus those references could be used` to bridge the small gap between the [ primary ] container and bordens claimed design'
id
so too here the secondary_references that the district_court relied on were not furniture or drapes or dresses or even human football_jerseys ; they were football_jerseys designed to be worn by dogs
moreover as discussed above the v2 could easily have served as a primary_reference itself so similar is its overall_visual_appearance to that of the claimed design and the eagles_jersey
see supra n. 3
we therefore agree that those references were` so related' to the eagles_jersey that the striking similarity in appearance across all three *1335 jerseys would have motivated a skilled_designer to combine features from one with features of another

with respect to the only remaining difference between the eagles_jersey and the ¡¬488 claimed design-the presence of additional_ornamental_surge stitching running down the rear of the jersey-the district_court acknowledged that no prior_art_reference contained exactly that same stitching on the rear of the jersey but nevertheless concluded that this was not a` substantial' difference that created a patentably distinct design but rather was a` de minimis_change [ ] which would be well within the skill of an ordinary_designer in the art'
mrc 921 f.supp.2d at 809 citing in re_carter 673_f.2d_1378 1380 ccpa 1982

mrc argues that adding any ornamental feature to a primary_reference that is not suggested by the prior_art is by definition more than de minimis.5 but our case law plainly contradicts that position ; on numerous occasions we have invalidated design_patents despite the inclusion of ornamental features that were entirely absent from prior_art_designs
see e.g. in re_nalbandian 661 f.2d at 1217 different_shape of fluting on finger grips and different_shape of pincers were de minimis differences in design for tweezers ; in re_carter 673 f.2d at 1380 modifications to the waistband of an infant garment were` de minimis_changes which would be well within the skill of an ordinary_designer in the art' ; in re chung no._00-1148 2000_wl_1476861 at *3 fed.cir
oct._4,_2000 two small depressions in the design of a cigarette package were de minimis_changes ; in re cooper 480_f.2d_900 901-02 ccpa 1973 affirming boards conclusion that numerous changes to the design of a prior_art building-including a single rather than double door and the addition of windows-were de minimis because the overall impression was still a building that looked like a barrel

here the eagles_jersey had already disclosed the use of ornamental_surge_stitching
the only additional step needed was to extend the stitching down the sides of the rear of the jersey
moreover the v2_jersey plainly suggested the addition of vertical lines down the rear of the jersey through the use of the seams between the two types of fabric
we agree with the district_court that adding ornamental_surge_stitching on top of a preexisting seam was an insubstantial change that would have been obvious to a skilled_designer.6

c. secondary considerations
in support of the non-obviousness of its patents mrc submitted evidence relating to commercial_success copying and acceptance by others
first with respect to *1336 commercial_success mrc argued that the sales of the v3_jersey which embodied the patented_design were more successful than sales of the v2 design it replaced
second mrc alleged that hunter and cdi chose to copy the patented v3 design rather than other available non-patented_designs
and third mrc points out that it has granted a license on the ¡¬488_patent

the district_court noted that the only evidence in support of these secondary_considerations was the testimony of the inventor himself which was` unpersuasive to demonstrate a genuine_dispute' of fact sufficient to defeat summary_judgment of obviousness
mrc 921 f.supp.2d at 810
mrc argues that in so doing the district_court effectively dismissed the uncontroverted secondary_considerations evidence as if it did not exist rather than construing the evidence in the favor of the non-moving party-in this case mrc
mrc also points out that hunter and cdi failed to provide any evidence of another explanation for those secondary_considerations besides a nexus with the claimed design

here however mrc has the standard backwards
as the patentee it was mrcs burden of production to demonstrate a nexus between the claimed design and the secondary_considerations
see crocs 598 f.3d at 1311
mrc presented no evidence whatsoever that the commercial_success and copying were related to the merits of the claimed invention
merely stating-with no supporting figures or data-that the v3 was more successful than the v2 is insufficient on its own to establish that the v3 has been a` commercial_success' and that its success was attributable to the claimed design features
moreover the only license mrc produced was between mrc and fig a company that is at least partially owned by mark_cohen who also owns mrc

thus although the district_courts analysis of secondary_considerations was admittedly somewhat cursory we do not believe that the evidence of record before the district_court created a genuine_dispute of material_fact ; to the contrary even construing the evidence in the light most favorable to mrc mrc had not established a nexus between the secondary_considerations and the claimed design that was sufficient to overcome the other evidence of obviousness

because we affirm the invalidity of the ¡¬488_patent on obviousness grounds we need not reach hunters alternative argument that the patent is invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡± 112
nor would it be appropriate for us to do so as a denial of a motion for summary_judgment is not a final appealable decision
see lermer ger
gmbh v. lermer corp. 94_f.3d_1575 1576 fed.cir.1996` the final judgment rule prohibits a party from appealing a district_courts denial of a motion for summary_judgment
``

ii
the ¡¬487_patent
a similar analysis applies to the ¡¬487_patent
the district_court also found the ¡¬487_patent obvious relying on the baseball version of the sporty_k9 jersey as the` primary_reference' and the v2 and eagles_football_jerseys as the secondary_references
mrc 921 f.supp.2d at 811-12
a side-by-side_comparison of the ¡¬487_design and the sporty_k9_baseball_jersey is depicted below

?
*1337 mrc again argues that there are several major differences between the sporty_k9_baseball_jersey and the design claimed in the ¡¬487_patent and that the district_court erred by failing to translate the patented_design into a verbal_description and instead focusing only on high-level similarities between the two designs

as with the ¡¬488_patent although the district_court did not expressly undertake to translate the patented_design by itself a description can easily be seen from the courts discussion of the similarities and differences between the sporty_k9_baseball_jersey and the patented_design
specifically the court noted that the patented_design has a v-shaped collar two openings for sleeves with cuffs for the front limbs a banded opening at the bottom for the hind portion of the pet and four buttons extending vertically down the front of the jersey
id.at 811
in pointing out the differences between the two designs the court noted that the patented_design contains a mesh fabric not found in the sporty_k9 jersey that it is less` tubular' in shape than the sporty_k9 jersey and that it lacks the` faux t-shirt' collar_portion of the sporty_k9 jersey
id.at 811-12
thus the district_court sufficiently described the patented_design so as to` evoke a visual image consonant with the claimed design'
durling 101 f.3d at 104

moreover we agree with the district_court that the overall_visual_impression of the sporty_k9_baseball_jersey is` basically the same' as the ¡¬ 487 patented_design
indeed of the several minor differences the district_court pointed out between the two products only the less tubular shape of the ¡¬487_design truly affects the overall_visual_impression of the design as a whole
as to that difference hunter provided evidence that the sporty_k9 jersey more closely resembles the patented_design when actually worn by a pet rather than when depicted in plan_view ; an image from the sporty_k9 brochure reveals that *1338 a garment there a dog sports jacket which appears quite tubular in plan_view just like the sporty_k9_baseball_jersey actually appears much shorter in the front when worn by a dog
j.a
160
thus the sporty_k9_baseball_jersey can reasonably be considered a` primary_reference' for purposes of the obviousness_analysis

additionally once the sporty_k9_baseball_jersey is identified as the primary_reference the secondary_references would easily have led an ordinary_designer to make the claimed design
the district_court relied on both the v2 and eagles_football_jerseys to demonstrate that the use of mesh and a less` tubular' shape were well known in the prior_art for pet_jerseys
mrc 921 f.supp.2d at 812
for the same reasons as discussed above we have no trouble concluding that those jerseys are` so related' to the claimed design that the mere_similarity in visual appearance would suggest the combination of those features to create the claimed design

we therefore affirm the district_courts grant of summary_judgment of invalidity of the ¡¬487_patent

affirmed

this conclusion is not inconsistent with the law of this circuit on design_patent infringement
in that context we have often noted that design_patents have` almost no scope' beyond the precise images shown in the drawings
in re mann 861_f.2d_1581 1582 fed.cir.1988
however in practice our focus on the` overall_visual_appearance' of a claimed design rather than on individual features has led us to find products infringing despite differences in specific ornamental features
for example in crocs inc. v. international trade commission 598_f.3d_1294_(fed.cir.2010) we concluded that all of the accused products infringed the asserted design_patents despite the fact that two of the infringing products the groovy dawgstm shoes and big dawgstm shoes contained a wider shoe front with an additional row of holes and another infringing product the effervescent waldies at shoe contained square holes on the top of the shoe rather than round ones
id.at 1303-06
2
the relatively few other cases in which we evaluated whether a prior_art design can serve as a` primary_reference' are unhelpful as they either conclude that a reference that is more similar to the claimed design than we have in this case can serve as a primary_reference see e.g. titan_tire_corp. 566 f.3d at 1380-82 ; in re_borden 90 f.3d at 1575 or that a less similar reference can not see e.g. durling 101 f.3d at 103-04 ; rosen 673 f.2d at 391
3
alternatively the district_court could have relied on the v2_jersey as the primary_reference
the only differences between the v2_jersey and the claimed design are 1 that the v2_jersey does not contain an` interlock' fabric panel ; 2 it has` drop' sleeves while the claimed jersey has` raglan-style' sleeves ; and 3 the v2_jersey lacks any ornamental_surge_stitching
mrc 921 f.supp.2d at 807
a side-by-side_comparison of the two designs demonstrates that of those three differences only the ornamental_surge_stitching truly alters the` overall_visual_appearance' of the design
moreover the ornamental_stitching on the claimed design is suggested by the seam lines on the v2_jersey further minimizing the difference in overall appearance
thus either the` eagles' jersey or the v2_jersey could have served as a` primary_reference' for purposes of the obviousness_analysis
4
mrc argues that this conclusion is` clearly improper' in light of our recent decision in high_point 730_f.3d_1301
however that case is not on point
there we faulted the district_court for failing to explain the reasoning behind its determination that a given` primary_reference' was` basically the same as the claimed design' and so we remanded for the district_court to do a side-by-side_comparison of the designs and determine if they create the same_visual_impression
id.at 1314
the district_court here did exactly that when it listed five specific features that rendered the eagles_jersey` basically the same' as the patented_design and explained that the three minor differences did not defeat the similarity in overall_visual_appearance
see supra section i.a
high_point did not address the situation presented here where the district_court relied on the visual similarity between the patented_design and the various secondary_references to conclude that the secondary_references would have suggested particular design modifications to a skilled_designer
5
alternatively mrc argues that at the very least the differences between the prior_art and the claimed design are not insignificant as a matter of law but rather give rise to a genuine issue of material_fact as to how the designs would be viewed by an ordinary_designer
however as explained below we believe that even construing the evidence in the light most favorable to mrc no reasonable fact-finder could find in mrcs favor on this issue
see supra at 1335
6
to be clear we do not intend to suggest that merely because one prior_art_reference used ornamental_surge_stitching any use of such stitching would have been a de minimis_change
rather the addition of the surge stitching in this case was de minimis because it merely followed the visual lines created by the seams of the v2_jersey ; in other_words it served only to highlight a design feature that had already existed in the v2 prior_art jersey
