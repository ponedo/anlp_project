moore circuit_judge
watson_laboratories inc. appeals the district of delawares final_judgment holding watson failed to prove by clear and convincing_evidence that claims 9_and_11 of u.s. patent no._8613,950` the950_patent` would have been obvious
we hold the district_court clearly erred in finding a skilled_artisan would not have been motivated to use the claim elements
considering the district_courts clear_error together with the remainder of its fact_findings we conclude that claims 9_and_11 of the950_patent would have been obvious
we therefore reverse

background
in 2003 the food & drug administration` fda' granted bayer1 approval to market vardenafil hydrochloride_trihydrate to treat erectile_dysfunction` ed' under the name levitra
vardenafil belongs to a class of ed_drugs called phosphodiesterase_inhibitors
when the fda approved levitra two other phosphodiesterase_inhibitors were already on the market pfizer launched sildenafil under the name viagra in 1998 and eli lilly launched tadalafil under the name cialis in 2003
levitra viagra and cialis are each formulated as immediate-release tablets that are swallowed whole

the950_patent issued on december 24 2013
it claims priority to march_1,_2005 and lists bayer as its assignee
it is directed to a formulation of vardenafil` in the form of an uncoated_tablet which disintegrates rapidly in the mouth' commonly referred to as an oral_disintegrating_tablet` odt'
see950_patent at claim 8
bayer markets a commercial embodiment of the950_patent vardenafil odt under the name staxyn

watson filed an abbreviated new drug application` anda' with the fda seeking approval to market a generic version of staxyn
bayer filed the instant case asserting infringement of the950_patent
claims *1320 9_and_11 both of which depend from claim 8 are the only claims at issue 8
a drug_formulation in the form of an uncoated_tablet which disintegrates rapidly in the mouth and releases the drug in the mouth without swallowing the tablet comprising vardenafil hydrochloride_trihydrate and at least two sugar_alcohols
9
the drug_formulation according to claim 8 wherein said sugar_alcohols are a mixture of sorbitol and mannitol
11
the drug_formulation of claim 8 wherein at least one sugar_alcohol is sorbitol
the parties agree that claim 8s requirement that the formulation` releases the drug in the mouth' means it is an immediate-release_formulation

the district_court held a six-day bench_trial to consider the validity of the950_patent
watson argued the claimed formulation of vardenafil would have been obvious to a person of ordinary_skill in the art based on multiple exemplary references showing a motivation to 1 create an odt_formulation of vardenafil2 ; 2 select mannitol and sorbitol as sugar_alcohols3 ; and 3 make the odt_formulation immediate-release
the district_court rejected each of watsons arguments
it found a person of ordinary_skill in the art would not have been motivated to create an odt_formulation of vardenafil and would not have used mannitol and sorbitol as excipients
it found the prior_art taught away from formulating vardenafil odt as immediate-release
the district_court also addressed bayers objective_evidence of nonobviousness and found it supported its conclusion that watson failed to prove by clear and convincing_evidence that claims 9_and_11 would have been obvious

a patent may not issue` if the differences between the subject_matter sought to be patented and the prior_art are such that the subject_matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary_skill in the art to which said subject_matter pertains'

a. vardenafil odt limitation
the district_court determined that watson failed to meet its burden of proving by clear and convincing_evidence that there would have been a motivation to formulate vardenafil as an odt_formulation
this determination rested largely on the courts finding the testimony of bayers expert dr._wicks more persuasive than the testimony of watsons expert dr._jacobs
the district_court found it important that according to dr._wicks no ed odt drug was on the market as of the950_patents priority_date
j.a
9-10 citing j.a
676_at_85515-19
it credited dr._wicks testimony that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would not have focused on an odt_formulation of vardenafil` because of the rarity of odt_formulations'
j.a
9 citing j.a
671_at_83321-834:2
it cited dr._wicks testimony in finding that a person of ordinary_skill in the art` would not have considered vardenafil to be a good_candidate for formulation as an odt because vardenafil was known as an [ ed ] medication and odts were not considered particularly applicable to this area'
j.a
9 citing j.a
675-big_token__76_at_852__big_token13-853:4 853:25-854:4

the district_court cited the absence of any other odt_formulations of ed_drugs on the market as of the950_patents priority_date
it cited the fu reference which like the scrip reference showed pfizer announced plans to launch an odt_version of viagra sildenafil in may 1998 but noted pfizer still had not brought the product to market by march 2005
j.a
9 citing j.a
19103-04
despite the fact that the 2005 ghosh reference stated that pfizer was continuing to develop an odt_formulation of sildenafil the court found this not persuasive because it concluded that the references claim was based on a publication from 1998
j.a
9 citing j.a
19196-97 19210
it cited the habib reference which did not list ed_drugs in its table titled` various therapeutic areas in which the fast-dissolve dosage forms are most applicable' to support finding that odts were not particularly applicable to ed_drugs
j.a
9 citing j.a
19265

the clear_error in the district_court_fact finding that there was no motivation to formulate ed_drugs in odts is that it concluded that the record did not contain an indication that ed_drugs would be good_candidates for odt_formulations
see e.g. j.a
9 finding` vardenafil was known as an [ ed ] medication and odts were not considered particularly applicable to this area'
this is simply not accurate
watson relied on nine prior_art_references to support its assertion that there would have been a motivation to create an odt_formulation of vardenafil
dr._jacobs testified *1322 that the chang reference states` drugs for [ ed ] would be good_candidates for odt_formulation'
j.a
448_at_31020-311:11
he testified the boolell and fryburg references each disclose formulating vardenafil as an odt
j.a
448-big_token__49_at_3__big_token11:17-312:6
he testified that numerous companies had already begun formulating odt_versions of ed_drugs pfizer filed the bell-huff patent application directed to sildenafil odt ; eisai filed the furitsu patent application claiming an odt_formulation of phosphodiesterase_inhibitors ; and lavipharm filed the chen international patent application identifying odt_versions of sildenafil
j.a
449-big_token__50_at_314__big_token3-319:1
watsons post-trial briefing identifies the same set of references all of which were produced as trial exhibits and filed with the court

these six references-chang boolell fryburg bell-huff furitsu and chen-are absent from the district_courts decision
while it is certainly not necessary for a district_court to evaluate all references presented to it nowhere here does it mention these key references in analyzing whether the prior_art taught vardenafil odt or whether a skilled_artisan would have been motivated to formulate vardenafil odt
these references are highly relevant to whether a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have been motivated to formulate odt vardenafil
and their express_disclosures cause the district_court_fact finding regarding motivation to combine to be clear_error
see pfizer 480 f.3d at 1363 holding the district_court clearly erred when it failed to consider relevant_prior_art

the district_courts finding that` the [ person of ordinary_skill in the art ] would not have considered vardenafil to be a good_candidate for formulation as an odt because vardenafil was known as an erectile_dysfunction medication and odts were not considered particularly applicable to this area' is contradicted by the references cited by dr._jacobs that the court failed to consider
j.a
9 ; see also id
(` [ t ] here was no reason for the [ person of ordinary_skill in the art ] to focus on an odt vardenafil because of the rarity of odt_formulations`
all six of the prior_art_references disregarded by the district_court identify ed_drugs as odt_formulations
chang identifies ed_drugs as one of five drug classes considered candidates for fast-dissolving tablets
j.a
19024
boolell states ed_drugs such as sildenafil and vardenafil can be` administered orally buccally or sublingually in the form of tablets' and` may also be administered as fast-dispersing or fast-dissolving dosage forms'
j.a
19689-90 ? ?
49-54 63
fryburg provides the same disclosure limited to vardenafil
j.a
19677_at_631-39
bell-huff furitsu and chen show that between 1999_and_2001 more than one company sought patent protection on odt_formulations of ed_drugs
bell-huff is directed to` rapidly disintegrating oral dosage forms which contain sildenafil'
j.a
19683 ?
2
furitsu is titled` tablets immediately disintegrating in the oral_cavity' and is directed to phosphodiesterase_inhibitors the class in which vardenafil sildenafil and tadalafil belong
j.a
19077
and chen is directed to sildenafil formulations one example of which includes a` fast dissolving tablet'
j.a
19797
all of these references indicate a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have considered odt_formulations applicable to ed_drugs
and several of these references indicate a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have considered odt_formulations to be applicable to vardenafil in particular

bayer argues that watsons arguments concerning many of its references such as chang boolell and fryburg were insignificant and the district_court did not clearly err by failing to address them
it argues *1323 that while watson asserts on appeal that the district_court ignored its key prior_art watson flooded the district_court with references without adequately addressing them
we do not agree

watson produced a significant number of references to support its argument that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have been motivated to formulate an odt_formulation of vardenafil
while it may at times be unwise for a party to rely on numerous prior_art_references when challenging a patent on obviousness grounds watsons approach was not untenable here
watson produced these nine references to support a narrow point they each` disclosed formulating vardenafil and other approved ed_drugs into odts'
j.a
935
its expert dr._jacobs addressed each of these nine references after he was asked` were there any references that discussed formulating erectile_dysfunction drugs in particular into odts ?'
j.a
448-big_token__50_at_310__big_token20-319:1
chang boolell and fryburg were the first three references he discussed
j.a
448-big_token__49_at_3__big_token 10:20-313:13
watson addressed the same nine references in its post-trial briefing under the heading` the prior art suggested formulating vardenafil and other approved ed drugs as odts'
j.a
935
while watsons discussion of the various references was at times succinct dr._jacobs testimony and watsons arguments were tailored to the simple point that odt_formulations of ed_drugs were known
it is unnecessary for example to delve deeply into the meaning of a patent application directed to an` intraoral quickly disintegrating tablet containing a phosphodiesterase inhibitor' to explain that application discloses an odt_formulation of an ed_drug
j.a
19077 furitsu ; see j.a
450_at_31623-318:10 dr._jacobs testimony ; j.a
936-37 watsons post-trial briefing
changs listing of` drugs for [ ed ]' among five types of drugs that can be considered for odts speaks for itself
j.a
19024 ; see j.a
448_at_31024-311:16 dr._jacobs testimony ; j.a
937 watsons post-trial briefing
watson clearly presented and preserved its arguments relating to the prior_art for the vardenafil odt_limitation
in light of these references the district_court clearly erred in determining that one of skill would not have been motivated to make odt_formulations of ed_drugs

dr._wicks testimony does not cast doubt on the weight of watsons evidence regarding the vardenafil odt_limitation
many of the references watson relies on for this limitation were unchallenged by dr._wicks
for example dr._wicks did not present testimony on changs disclosure that ed_drugs can be considered candidates for odts
he did not question or critique any of the three patent applications directed to odt_formulations of ed_drugs-bell-huff furitsu and chen
his only discussion of bell-huff concerned the immediate-release limitation and he did not mention furitsu or chen at all
rather dr._wicks testimony that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would not have considered odts applicable to ed_drugs on which the district_court relied was expressly limited to the habib and fu references
see j.a
9 ; j.a
676_at_85325-854:4 q` okay
so in light of the information that we saw in habib and fu if the person of ordinary_skill were to think about alternate formulations of vardenafil would they focus on odts ?'
a` no
theres no indication that theyre applicable`
in fact dr._wicks expressly conceded that the prior_art described ed_drugs as candidates for odt_formulations
j.a
690_at_91123-912:2
this case does not present a situation in which the district_courts credibility_determination can be understood to discount the prior_art_references it failed to address based on one experts characterization of the prior_art
see e.g. *1324 senju pharm co. v. lupin ltd 780_f.3d_1337 1351 fed
cir
2015 deferring to district_courts credibility_determination to credit competing testimony regarding the prior_arts teaching

it is well within the district_courts discretion to credit one experts competing testimony over another
we` must give due regard to the trial courts opportunity to judge the witnesses credibility'

cir
1992` we will not invade the province of the district_court to judge matters of credibility`
but a district_court can not through a credibility_determination ignore the wealth of evidence especially as in this case where the expert did not even address it
the district_courts finding that odts were not considered applicable to ed_drugs is clearly erroneous in light of watsons evidence
see j.a
9

the remainder of the district_courts findings underlying the motivation to formulate vardenafil odt focused too heavily on the commercial_availability of odt_formulations of ed_drugs as of the950_patents priority_date
see e.g. j.a
9 finding` it important that prior_art_references from 2004 listing odts on the market and likely to come to market in the next few years did not list any drugs for the treatment of erectile_dysfunction' ; j.a
10` [ n ] o odt of an erectile_dysfunction drug was on the market by march 2005`
it is unclear why the district_court found it important that no odt ed_drug had gained fda_approval as of950_patents priority_date
the motivation to combine inquiry is not limited to what products are forthcoming or currently available on the market
particularly given the lengthy fda_approval process the pharmaceutical industry is no exception
any motivation` whether articulated in the references themselves or supported by evidence of the knowledge of a skilled_artisan is sufficient'
outdry techs corp. v. geox s.p.a. 859_f.3d_1364 1370-71 fed cir
2017
here the motivation to formulate an odt_version of vardenafil is plainly evident from the face of multiple prior_art_references disclosing odt_formulations of ed_drugs
no further rationale for developing vardenafil odt was necessary
on review of the entire record evidence before the district_court we are left with the definite and firm_conviction that the district_court clearly erred when it found there would not have been a motivation to formulate vardenafil odt

b. sorbitol and mannitol limitation
claim 9 requires the vardenafil odt_formulation contain a mixture of sorbitol and mannitol and claim 11 more generally requires that the odt_formulation contain at least two sugar_alcohols one of which must be sorbitol
neither party disputes that it was known-if not necessary-to include a sugar_alcohol in odt_formulations
the parties dispute rests on whether a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have been motivated to select the claimed combination of sugar_alcohols sorbitol and mannitol

the district_court found a person of ordinary_skill in the art would not have been motivated to use mannitol and sorbitol in an odt_formulation finding dr._wicks testimony on this limitation more credible than dr._jacobs
it found dr._jacobs reliance on the bauer_reference unpersuasive because bauers disclosure that the combination of mannitol and sorbitol could optimize tableting properties was based on a 1978 article
j.a
12 citing j.a
467_at_38519-386:12 ; j.a
18593-94 bauer
it noted dr._jacobs relied on the pharmaburst reference which advertised an off-the-shelf excipient containing a combination *1325 of mannitol and sorbitol but found it contained no working examples or experimental_data
j.a
12-13 citing j.a
454-big_token__55_at_335__big_token23-336:1
it found dr._jacobs testimony that a skilled_artisan would have been motivated to use a mixture of sorbitol and mannitol to avoid the need for specialized_packaging unpersuasive in light of his contrary testimony that` there is no need for specialized_packaging' when a particular manufacturing process is employed
j.a
13 citing j.a
453_at_3283-15 discussing the joshi reference ; j.a
446_at_30116-302:1
it found persuasive dr._wicks testimony that` every odt on the market in the relevant_prior_art time frame contained only a single_sugar_alcohol mannitol' and that` there were no known_problems with the use of mannitol in the existing odts'
j.a
12 citing j.a
683_at_8841-19 ; j.a
685_at_89111-17
it found` there was nothing in the prior_art that would have given the [ person of ordinary_skill in the art ] a reason to use sorbitol in addition to mannitol in an odt'
j.a
12 citing j.a
686_at_89412-15

we do not question the district_courts credibility_determinations
however the district_courts analysis for the sorbitol and mannitol_limitation again focused on the commercial_availability of products while failing to address relevant_prior_art
upon consideration of the entire record and under a proper analysis we conclude that the district_court clearly erred in finding a person of ordinary_skill in the art would not have been motivated to formulate an odt with sorbitol and mannitol

the parties do not dispute that as of the950_patents priority_date a company named spi_pharma marketed an off-the-shelf_odt_excipient_product called pharmaburst
the parties agree pharmaburst existed in three different forms two using only mannitol and a third pharmaburst_b2 containing mannitol and sorbitol
the950_patent specification uses pharmaburst_b2 in an example
see950_patent at 6:31-34
thus there can be no question that it was known as of the950_patents priority_date to use sorbitol and mannitol in odt_formulations

dr._jacobs testified that the norman reference not addressed by the district_court discloses examples of odt_formulations using sorbitol and mannitol created by spi_pharma

see j.a
12

the district_courts remaining findings on the motivation to use sorbitol and mannitol in an odt_formulation5 focused solely on the odt market as of the950_patents priority_date
see j.a
12` [ e ] very odt on the market in the relevant_prior_art time framed contained only a single_sugar_alcohol mannitol

684_at_8852-15 testifying that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would look to currently-available odt products to know whether the fda considered the excipients safe and effective
accepting fully dr._wicks testimony on this point the motivation to combine inquiry for drug_formulations is not limited to what already has or could gain fda_approval
we have previously explained there is no requirement in patent law that the person of ordinary_skill be motivated to develop the claimed invention based on a rationale that forms the basis for fda_approval
motivation to combine may be found in many different places and forms ; it can not be limited to those reasons the fda sees fit to consider in approving drug applications

2013
while fda_approval may be relevant to the obviousness inquiry see id.at 1291-92 a lack of fda_approval can not negate an otherwise apparent motivation to formulate a product
the district_court clearly erred in finding no motivation to use sorbitol and mannitol in odts ; watsons evidence expressly demonstrated that sorbitol and mannitol in odts was known in the art and that there were advantageous reasons to use them

c. immediate-release limitation
the district_court found that even if a skilled_artisan would have been motivated to make an odt_formulation of vardenafil *1327 the prior_art taught away from formulating vardenafil odt as immediate_release
j.a
10-11
the parties agree that only two types of odt_formulations were known in the art immediate-release_odts which are released in the mouth and delayed-release_odts which are released in the stomach
the district_court found based again on expert testimony that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have expected vardenafil odt to have a bitter_taste which would have discouraged him from creating a formulation that releases vardenafil in the mouth
j.a
10
it also found a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have been concerned with using an immediate-release_formulation because it would be expected to increase bioavailability and levitras label suggested an increase in vardenafil blood levels would be a problem for older men
j.a
11

we do not disturb the district_courts findings relating to vardenafils expected bitter_taste and increased bioavailability but the district_court erred when it elevated those findings to teaching away

the district_court did not find that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have believed vardenafils expected bitter_taste and increased bioavailability would have likely rendered an immediate-release_formulation unproductive
instead the district_courts analysis focused on whether a person of ordinary_skill in the art would` necessarily have made an immediate-release_odt rather than a delayed-release_odt'

when there are only two possible formulations and both are known in the art at the time the fact that there may be reasons a skilled_artisan would prefer one over the other does not amount to a teaching away from the lesser preferred but still workable option
the district_courts finding that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have first pursued a delayed-release_formulation over an immediate-release_formulation is insufficient to support a finding of teaching away

the evidence before the district_court supports its finding that a person of ordinary_skill in the art may have preferred a delayed-release_formulation over immediate_release-not that an immediate-release_formulation was unlikely to be productive in vardenafil odt
rather than testify that a skilled_artisan would have believed the taste of vardenafil is too bitter to formulate as an immediate-release_odt dr._wicks merely testified that` the consideration would lead them to a delayed-release_odt'
j.a
678_at_86322-864:7 answering` would the person of ordinary_skill have a reason to make a formulation of vardenafil an odt_formulation that releases the drug in the mouth the immediate-release type ?`
nor did dr._wicks point to prior_art suggesting vardenafil would have tasted *1328 too bitter
dr._wicks conceded` [ t ] he taste of vardenafil was not reported in the literature' and disclaimed that a person of ordinary_skill in the art` would have assumed that vardenafil was as bitter as sildenafil'
j.a
694_at_92516-926:4
when asked about bioavailability_concerns due to levitras label dr._wicks again focused on why those concerns would have caused a skilled_artisan to prefer a delayed-release_formulation
see j.a
681_at_87417-23 testifying` the making of a delayed-release_odt would be far simpler'
dr._wicks opined that the bioavailability_concerns` would clearly teach away from making an immediate-release_formulation' but when asked why he answered` [ b ] ecause you would get much greater control with a delayed-release_formulation'
j.a

this testimony supports the district_courts finding that the taste and bioavailability of vardenafil raised concerns and that a skilled_artisan may have preferred a delayed-release_formulation but it does not support a finding of teaching away

while the district_court did not clearly err in its fact finding that a skilled_artisan would have had concerns over an immediate-release_formulation due to vardenafils expected bitter_taste and bioavailability obviousness` does not require that the motivation be the best option only that it be a suitable option from which the prior_art did not teach away

pfizer 480 f.3d at 1359
watson demonstrated by clear and convincing_evidence that there would have been a motivation to formulate an odt_version of vardenafil
in fact the prior_art was explicit in the suggestion to make such a combination and the district_court clearly erred in its fact finding to the contrary
the prior_art of record expresses a clear motivation to formulate odt_versions of ed_drugs and *1329 that multiple companies were formulating odt_versions of ed_drugs
see j.a
19024 19077 19683 ?

watson also demonstrated by clear and convincing_evidence that there was an express motivation in the prior_art to use sorbitol and mannitol as the excipients in the odt_formulation of the ed_drug and the district_court clearly erred in its fact finding to the contrary
pharmaburst_b2 was a known off-the-shelf_odt_excipient_product that permitted formulation of odt products` in-house quickly and much more_cost effectively'

the district_court did not clearly err in its fact finding that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have had concerns using an immediate-release_formulation due to vardenafils expected bitter_taste and bioavailability ; however it clearly erred when it concluded that those findings taught away from the immediate_release
bayer presented evidence of copying and unexpected_results that weigh in favor of a conclusion of nonobviousness

weighing all four graham_factors we conclude claims 9_and_11 of the950_patent would have been obvious
the repeated suggestion in the prior_art to make an odt_formulation of an ed_drug and the suggestion to use the combination of sorbitol and mannitol as excipients are strong evidence of a motivation to make the claimed combination
the parties agree that odts were known to exist as either immediate-release or delayed-release_formulations
a skilled_artisan motivated to formulate vardenafil odt would have been faced with a design_need for its release profile and an immediate-release_formulation would have been one of two options
see ksr 550 u.s. at 402 127_s.ct._1727` when there is a design_need or market pressure to solve a problem and there are a finite number of identified predictable solutions a person of ordinary_skill in the art has good reason to pursue the known options within his or her technical grasp`
while a skilled_artisan may have preferred a delayed-release_formulation over the claimed immediate-release_formulation` that the prior_art as a whole suggests the desirability of a particular combination need not be supported by a finding that the prior_art suggests that the combination claimed.. is the preferred or most desirable combination'

weighing this evidence together with the objective_evidence of unexpected_results and copying we conclude that a skilled_artisan would have found the claimed combination obvious
the district_courts final_judgment is reversed

conclusion
for the reasons discussed above we reverse the district_courts holding that watson failed to prove by clear and convincing_evidence that claims 9_and_11 of the950_patent would have been obvious
