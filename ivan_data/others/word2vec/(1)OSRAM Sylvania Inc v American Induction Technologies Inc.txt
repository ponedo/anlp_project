osram_sylvania inc.` osram' appeals the district_courts grant of summary_judgment of invalidity of claims 1 17 25 27 and 32 of u.s. patent no._5834,905 the` ¡¬905_patent` issued to valery a. godyak et al. and assigned to osram

background
i
technology at issue
osram is the assignee of the ¡¬905_patent which claims a closed-loop tubular electrodeless lamp having certain and specific discharge current and pressure parameters
claim 1 which is representative recites

an electric lamp assembly comprising an electrodeless lamp including a closed-loop tubular_lamp_envelope enclosing mercury_vapor and a buffer_gas at a pressure less than 0.5 torr ; a transformer_core disposed so as to surround a portion of said closed-loop lamp envelope ; an input_winding disposed on said transformer_core ; and
a radio_frequency_power_source coupled to said input_winding for supplying sufficient radio frequency energy to said mercury_vapor and said buffer_gas to produce in said lamp envelope a discharge having a discharge current equal to or greater than about 2 amperes
¡¬905_patent_col. 8_ll._7 -19

this invention generally relates to` a low_pressure high intensity fluorescent light source that can produce considerably more light per unit length than conventional electroded fluorescent_lamps'
electrodeless fluorescent_lamps were first disclosed in several patents issued to and articles authored by john anderson of g.e
in the 1960s and 1970s
for example as described in the ¡¬905_patents` background of the invention' anderson claimed in u.s. patent no._3987,334 the` anderson_¡¬334_patent` a lamp having a torodial discharge tube that forms a continuous closed electrical path that passes through a torodial ferrite_core
applying a voltage to the wire wrapped around the ferrite_core creates a magnetic flux that in turn induces a discharge voltage along the tube
in effect the wire around the ferrite_core operates as the primary of a transformer with the lamp tube operating as the secondary of the transformer
thus` [ t ] he inner surface of the discharge tube is coated with a phosphor which emits visible light when irradiated by photons emitted by the excited mercury gas atoms'
¡¬905_patent_col. 2_ll._14 -16
the lamps described in the anderson_¡¬334_patent operated with a buffer_gas_pressure of` approximately 1 torr or less'
the ¡¬ 905 patent specification describes andersons lamp as inefficient and impractical however

the ¡¬905_patent also describes` a closed-loop tubular_lamp_envelope enclosing mercury_vapor.. a transformer_core disposed around the lamp envelope an input_winding disposed on the transformer_core and a radio_frequency_power_source coupled to the input_winding' but it specifies a buffer_gas_pressure of` less than about 0.5 torr'
¡¬905_patent_col. 2_ll._31 -37
`` the radio frequency source supplies sufficient radio frequency energy to the mercury_vapor and the buffer_gas to produce in the lamp envelope a discharge having a discharge current equal to or greater than about 2 amperes'
id
col. 2_ll._36 -41
operating a lamp at the parameters specified in the ¡¬905_patent -namely a buffer_gas_pressure of less than 0.5 torr and a discharge current equal to or greater than 2 amperes-allegedly results in a lamp with high output high efficiency and long operating life as compared to conventional *702 electroded fluorescent_lamps
in its preferred embodiment the lamp specified by the ¡¬905_patent operates with a buffer_gas_pressure equal to or less than about 0.2 torr and a discharge current equal to or greater than about 5.0 amperes
the specification of the ¡¬905_patent makes clear that it is this novel relationship-high discharge current combined with low buffer_gas_pressure-that results in the increased efficiency and small power loss in the ferrite_core

ii
procedural history
on november 30 2009 osram filed a complaint alleging that american_induction_technologies inc.s` aiti' 120-watt induction lamp infringes osrams ¡¬905_patent
aiti responded with counterclaims seeking declarations of non-infringement invalidity and unenforceability
osram moved for summary_judgment that the ¡¬905_patent was infringed and not invalid and aiti cross-moved for summary_judgment of invalidity due to anticipation and obviousness based on the anderson_¡¬334_patent
on february 14 2011 the district_court denied osrams motions and granted aitis motion with respect to claim 32
the district_court ruled from the bench in relevant_part claim 32 of the ¡¬905_patent is anticipated by andersons patent no._3987,334
all of the limitations of claim 32 are disclosed either expressly or inherently in andersons 334 patent
because the buffer_gas_pressure disclosed in the anderson 334 patent completely encompasses that disclosed in the ¡¬905_patent within a relatively narrow_range it discloses a pressure of less than5 torr and renders claim 32 invalid
atofina versus great lakes chemical corporation 441_f.3d_991_(fed.cir.2006)
a4200-01
with respect to the remaining claims the district_court characterized the parties positions as a` battle of the experts' and found that genuine_issues of material_fact precluded summary_judgment in favor of either party

after the courts finding that the anderson_¡¬334_patent anticipated claim 32 of the ¡¬905_patent aiti sought reconsideration of its motion for invalidity of the remaining independent_claims-claims 1 17 25 and 27
aiti argued that these other claims differed from claim 32 only with respect to a specified discharge current of greater than 2 amperes and therefore were obvious combinations of lamps disclosed in the anderson_¡¬334_patent and those described in an article by d.o
wharmby ph.d. entitled` electrodeless lamps for lighting a review' vol
140 ieee proceedings-a no._6 november 1993` wharmby'
notably aiti relied on no other references or prior_art to support its renewed motion for summary_judgment
in opposition osram contended that aiti failed to raise this specific combination of prior_art in its original motion for summary_judgment and that regardless osrams expert presented testimony that the different shapes of the lamps disclosed in the anderson_¡¬334_patent and wharmby precluded applying the teachings of one to the other
osram in particular argued that anderson_¡¬334_patent does not disclose all the shape limitations of claim 17-requiring two parallel tubes joined by two lateral tubes at each end
osram also noted that in denying osrams motion for summary_judgment the district_court ruled that material_issues of fact existed with respect to the teachings of wharmby
aiti acknowledged osrams arguments regarding the shape of the prior_art lamps and removed claim 17 from its motion for reconsideration in reply` to avoid additional distraction from the discharge current teachings of the prior *703 art'
j.a
4142
the district court granted aitis motion and declared the remaining independent_claims including claim 17 invalid as a matter of law
the courts ruling was again read from the bench and states in relevant_part defendant has demonstrated that this court inundated with complicated technical matters relating to the history and operation of electrodeless induction lamps failed to consider and appreciate the affect of certain_prior_art_references on the obviousness of certain independent_claims of the ¡¬905_patent

* * * given the virtually interchangeability between different topologies and the fact that the consequences of increasing radio_frequency_discharge was well known in a prior_art and specifically disclosed in the d.o
wharmby article the improvements reflected in independent claims 1 17 25_and_27 of increasing radio_frequency_discharge 2 or more_amperes was merely the predicable use of prior_art elements according to their established functions ; and a person of ordinary_skill in the art would recognize that increasing radio_frequency_discharge to 2 or more_amperes would improve tubular_lamps in the same_way that globular_lamps and lamps of other_topologies
the increased radio_frequency_discharge was the only improvement presented in claims 1 17 25_and_27
it was not found in claim 32 which this court has already ruled invalid for reasons of anticipation
pursuant to krs international company versus teleflex incorporated these claims are obvious in light of the prior_art and invalid
j.a
4286-86 [ sic throughout ]
osram requested clarification regarding the inclusion of claim 17 in the order and the court responded that` shape is irrelevant' and claim 17 was therefore invalid as obvious
the district_court ordered aiti to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law relating to the independent_claims but aiti did not comply with that order and the district_court failed to issue its own

after the independent_claims were invalidated osram granted aiti a covenant not to sue as to the dependent_claims and the district_court dismissed aitis counterclaims concerning the validity of the ¡¬905_patents dependent_claims
the parties then proceeded with a three-day bench trial from september 20-22 2011 on aitis counterclaims of inequitable_conduct after which the district_court found that no inequitable_conduct was committed during the prosecution of the ¡¬905_patent
the district_court entered final judgment on november 28 2011
osram timely appealed and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

discussion
on appeal osram argues that the district_court erred in granting summary_judgment that claim 32 of the ¡¬905_patent is anticipated by the anderson ¡¬ 334 patent and that claims 1 17 25 and 27 of the ¡¬905_patent are obvious in view of wharmby in combination with the anderson_¡¬334_patent
according to osram the district_court resolved a disputed issue of material_fact in its anticipation finding namely that the anderson_¡¬334_patent disclosed the operating condition of less than 0.5 torr through its reference to a lamp with` a pressure of approximately 1 torr or less' and resolved numerous disputed issues of fact in its obviousness finding relating the interchangeability of lamp_shapes
additionally osram asserts that the district_courts failure to address evidence of secondary_considerations of nonobviousness alone warrants reversal
aiti counters *704 that the earlier disclosed genus-1 torr or less-necessarily anticipates the later_species-less than 0.5 torr-and that the claims are otherwise obvious in light of various combinations of prior_art.1 aiti also contends that osram failed to present evidence of a nexus between the claimed invention and the alleged secondary_considerations and we therefore may overlook the district_courts failure to address them below

ii
we begin by addressing the district_courts finding that the anderson_¡¬334_patent anticipates claim 32 of the ¡¬905_patent
a patent claim is anticipated if each and every limitation is found in a single prior_art reference
35 u.s.c.¡± 102
patents are presumed to be valid and invalidity must be proven by clear and convincing_evidence
microsoft_corp. v. i4i ltd. p'ship -- - u.s. -- -- 131_s.ct._2238 2242 180_l.ed.2d_131_(2011)
osram argues that aiti faced an enhanced burden in establishing anticipation because the examiner considered the anderson *705 ¡¬334_patent during the prosecution of the ¡¬905_patent
while prior consideration of a reference during prosecution may carry some weight the burden to prove invalidity does not change ; at all times it remains a showing` by clear and convincing_evidence'
id
; see also tokai 632 f.3d at 1367

the parties dispute centers on whether the anderson_¡¬334_patent discloses a buffer_gas_pressure of less than 0.5 torr
aiti primarily relies on the legal argument that` the disclosure of a small genus may anticipate the species of that genus even if the species are not themselves recited'
bristol-myers squibb co. v. ben venue labs. inc. 246_f.3d_1368 1380 fed.cir.2001
referencing our decisions in atofina v. great lakes chemical corp. 441_f.3d_991_(fed.cir.2006) and clearvalue inc. v. pearl river polymers inc. 668_f.3d_1340_(fed.cir.2012) aiti asserts that the range in the anderson_¡¬334_patent which completely encompasses the range in the ¡¬905_patent is sufficient to disclose the claimed buffer_gas_pressure in the ¡¬905_patent2

we disagree
while it is true that an earlier disclosed genus may in certain circumstances anticipate a later_species this inquiry necessarily includes a factual component
see e.g. sanofi-synthelabo v. apotex inc. 550_f.3d_1075 1083 fed.cir.2008` [ w ] hether a generic disclosure necessarily anticipates everything within the genus.. depends on the factual aspects of the specific disclosure and the particular products at issue
`` ; atofina 441 f.3d at 999 ; in re baird 16_f.3d_380 382 fed.cir.1994
for example in atofina we analyzed a patent claiming a method of synthesizing difluoromethane at a temperature between 330-450 degrees_celsius
atofina 441 f.3d at 993
the prior_art in contrast disclosed a broad temperature range of 100-500 degrees_celsius
id.at 999
in atofina we reversed the district_courts finding of anticipation following a bench trial and we explained that our holding was premised on the` considerable difference between the claimed [ temperature ] range and the range in the prior_art'
id
our decision in atofina clarified that the prior_arts teaching of a broad genus does not necessarily disclose every species within that genus
id
under the circumstances presented in atofina` no reasonable fact finder could conclude that the prior_art describes the claimed range with sufficient specificity to anticipate this limitation of the claim'
id

contrary to aitis assertions our decision in clearvalue does nothing to alter the unequivocal statements in atofina
there we analyzed a patent relating to clarifying low alkalinity water and found that the jury lacked substantial evidence to find that certain prior_art-disclosing a chemical process with a range of 150 ppm or less-did not anticipate the asserted patent or disclose the claimed limitation of 50 ppm
clearvalue 668_f.3d_1340 1344-45
in clearvalue we explained that in contrast to the patentee in atofina clearvalue did not argue that the 50 ppm limitation was critical or that the claimed method worked differently at different points within the prior_art range of 150 ppm or less
id
and clearvalue did not allege that one of ordinary_skill would not have recognized 50 ppm as an acceptable *706 value for the range provided in the prior_art
id.at 1345

a correct application of atofina and clearvalue to the evidence presented here reveals clear disputed material_issues of fact and mandates reversal of the district_courts finding of anticipation
osram contends-and presented expert_testimony and evidence to support its contention-that the limitation of less than 0.5 torr is central to the invention claimed in the ¡¬ 905 patent and that a lamp would operate differently at various points within the range disclosed in the anderson_¡¬334_patent
specifically the patent itself claims that prior lamps including those disclosed in the anderson_¡¬334_patent are inefficient and impractical as compared to the ¡¬ 905 lamp precisely because they use pressure well above that claimed in the ¡¬ 905 patent

a trial may reveal a minimal difference between the anderson_¡¬334_patent prior range of` approximately 1 torr or less' and the less than 0.5 torr claimed in the ¡¬905_patent or that one of ordinary_skill would interpret` approximately 1 torr or less' as clearly disclosing less than 0.5 torr as an acceptable choice within that range but those questions can not be resolved as a matter of law on this record
indeed aiti made no effort to rebut the testimony of osrams expert regarding the importance of the claimed pressure to the invention or regarding what one of ordinary_skill would have understood from the disclosures in the anderson_¡¬334_patent
aiti relies instead on the conclusory claim that less than 0.5 torr necessarily falls within` approximately 1 torr or less' as a matter of fact
while true the inquiry does not end there
how one of ordinary_skill in the art would understand the scope of the disclosure or stated differently how one of ordinary_skill in the art would understand the relative size of a genus or species in a particular technology is of critical importance
and the district_courts failure to explain or support its statement that` the buffer_gas_pressure disclosed in the anderson_¡¬334_patent completely encompasses that disclosed in the ¡¬905_patent within a relatively narrow_range' or to justify its complete rejection of osrams expert_testimony complicates our review
we have no choice but to reverse the district_courts finding of anticipation on this record

iii
the district_courts obviousness rulings also fail because they depend on resolution of disputed issues of fact
a patent may not issue` if the differences between the subject_matter sought to be patented and the prior_art are such that the subject_matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary_skill in the art to which said subject_matter pertains'
35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a
obviousness is a question of law based on underlying factual findings 1 the scope and content of the prior_art ; 2 the differences between the claims and the prior_art ; 3 the level of ordinary_skill in the art ; and 4 objective considerations of nonobviousness
graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 17-18 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966)
generally a party seeking to invalidate a patent as obvious must demonstrate` by clear and convincing_evidence that a skilled_artisan would have been motivated to combine the teaching of the prior_art references to achieve the claimed invention and that the skilled_artisan would have had a reasonable expectation of success in doing so'
pfizer inc. v. apotex inc. 480_f.3d_1348 1361 fed.cir.2007 ; see also amgen inc. v. f. hoffman-la roche ltd. 580_f.3d_1340 1362 fed.cir.2009` an obviousness_determination requires that a skilled_artisan would have perceived a reasonable *707 expectation of success in making the invention in light of the prior_art'
( citations omitted
the supreme court has warned however that while an analysis of any teaching suggestion or motivation to combine known elements is useful to an obviousness_analysis the overall obviousness inquiry must be expansive and flexible
ksr int l co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 415 419 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007)

a
the district_court did no more than recite the test of ksr and draw general conclusions based thereon in its ruling on obviousness
the court did not make any specific findings of fact and gave no basis-other than an admission that it previously failed to consider submissions by the parties-for reversing its prior statement that disputed issues of fact existed
osram recognizes-correctly-that rule 52 a 3 states that a` court is not required to state findings or conclusions when ruling on a motion under rule..
56'
but as osram correctly notes both this circuit and the ninth circuit repeatedly have made clear that a trial_court must at least provide its analysis and grounds for entering judgment somewhere in the record
aiti counters that the district_courts findings are ascertainable from the parties own arguments and again contends that because we review judgments not opinions we are free to affirm on any ground supported by the record

it is not our role to scour the record and search for something to justify a lower_courts conclusions particularly at the summary_judgment stage
whether dealing with an issue of law like claim construction or an issue of fact such as infringement this court must be furnished` sufficient findings and reasoning to permit meaningful appellate scrutiny'
nazomi communs. inc. v. arm holdings plc 403_f.3d_1364 1371 fed.cir.2005 quoting gechter v. davidson 116_f.3d_1454 1458 fed.cir.1997
where as here the record is devoid of meaningful analysis we will not conduct such an analysis in the first_instance
id
; see also research corp. techs
v. microsoft_corp. 536_f.3d_1247 1254 fed.cir.2008` microsofts motions for summary_judgment were granted without a proper analysis regarding inequitable_conduct
this court therefore lacks findings and conclusions for adequate review`
we previously have had occasion to remind this very district_court of these important principles ; we do so once more here

in trimed inc. v. stryker corp. 608_f.3d_1333 1343 fed.cir.2010 we reversed this district_courts obviousness ruling for failing to address among other things what the asserted prior_art teaches both the record in this case and the order granting strykers motion for summary_judgment are devoid of such reasoning
instead of supporting its obviousness_analysis with cogent reasoning the order merely states that` [ a ] common_sense [ sic ] solution to this problem [ i.e. pin migration ] involves stabilizing the pin against.. displacement.. [ and ] the logical solution would be to select a prior_art plate that had holes with an appropriate diameter..' order granting strykers mot
for summ
j. of invalidity 14
neither the record before us nor the order of the district_court explains why one of ordinary_skill in the art at the time of the invention would have found replacing a cast normally used to stabilize a pin with a subcutaneous metal plate to be a logical commonsense_solution to this problem
merely saying that an invention is a logical commonsense_solution to a known problem does not make it so
*708 id
aiti tries to limit trimed to scenarios where the district_court explicitly references only` common_sense' as the basis for its obviousness findings
there is no justification for limiting trimed in that fashion however
the point made there as here is that the trial_court must explain how it reached the conclusions it does particularly where there is evidence in the record supporting the non-movants position
aitis request that we forgive the lower_courts failure to explain its ruling-and insistence that we should review the record in the first_instance to ascertain what the lower_court might have been thinking-rings particularly hollow given aitis failure to respond to the trial_courts order to submit findings of fact and conclusions of law

b
with respect to the substance of the district_courts ruling on obviousness osram primarily takes issue with the district_courts pronouncement that` shape is irrelevant' and that` a person of ordinary_skill in the art would recognize that increasing radio_frequency_discharge to 2 or more_amperes would improve tubular_lamps in the same_way that [ sic ] globular_lamps and lamps of other_topologies'
j.a
4286
aiti responds that claims 1 25 27 and 32 of the ¡¬905_patent are prima facie obvious based on wharmby
according to aiti wharmby discloses a lamp meeting the physical configurations of the ¡¬905_patent lamp by way of reference to an earlier anderson article regarding operating conditions within the scope of those claimed by the ¡¬905_patent

substantial factual disputes exist however as to whether one of ordinary_skill would consider the lamp_shape to be irrelevant or more specifically whether one of ordinary_skill would have been motivated to combine the anderson_lamp with wharmby or operate the anderson_lamp at the conditions disclosed in wharmby
osrams expert dr._lawler testified that wharmby` teaches away from the closed-loop_tubular_design of the ¡¬905_patent` and aitis expert mr. edward hammer acknowledged that wharmby disparages the very external ferrite_core closed-loop_tubular_design of the anderson patent that aiti argued would be obvious to combine with wharmby
j.a
4101 ; a4106-07
osram also references dr._lawlers opinion that` discharge plasmas are inherently unpredictable and may behave differently in different lamp topologies.. one could not predict results or success simply by taking known discharge plasma behavioral characteristics from globular-style lamps and trying to apply them to a closed-loop tubular lamp with external ferrite_cores'
j.a
4108-09

additionally at the inequitable_conduct trial aiti focused on the purported failure of the ¡¬905_patents inventors to disclose certain_prior_art_references about globular_lamps including two articles written by the inventors and wharmby
the district_court after hearing live testimony reached the conclusion that the inventors of the ¡¬905_patent credibly believed that wharmby was not material to the ¡¬905_patent
while the question of intent and credibility as it relates to inequitable_conduct is certainly different than the scope of a prior_art reference this finding highlights the inconsistent and unsupportable nature of the district_courts ruling on obviousness and lays bare a disputed issue of fact with respect to the teachings of wharmby
for at least this reason we reverse the grant of summary_judgment and remand

c. separately and in addition nothing in the record indicates that the *709 court considered osrams evidence of secondary_considerations of nonobviousness
at summary_judgment osram submitted evidence of long felt need failure of others and industry praise evidence which aiti did not rebut below
aiti makes no effort to argue that the district_court considered this evidence or even to claim that it did rebut osrams proffered evidence
instead aiti asks that we reject osrams evidence of secondary_considerations by finding in the first_instance that osrams evidence is not tied adequately to the full scope of the asserted claims
aitis arguments are without merit
despite aitis contentions we have emphatically rejected any formal burden-shifting framework in evaluating the four graham_factors and the district_courts failure to consider the evidence requires reversal

`` ; trimed 608 f.3d at 1343` we have repeatedly held that evidence of secondary_considerations must be considered if present..
there is no indication in the record that as required by our precedent the court considered at all the evidence of secondary_considerations offered by trimed`
on remand the district_court must in the first_instance consider secondary_considerations before finding a claim obvious

d. the parties disagree as to the propriety of the district_courts decision to include claim 17 in its ruling on obviousness after aiti expressly removed that claim from its initial summary_judgment motion
while a trial_court may invalidate a claim sua sponte where no motion regarding that claim is before it it may not do so without prior notice to the non-movant and an opportunity for the non-movant to address such an unanticipated action
see portland retail druggists ass n v. kaiser found
health plan 662_f.2d_641 645 9th cir.1981
because we reverse the courts determination of obviousness on other grounds we need not and do not reach this issue

conclusion
for all of the reasons discussed above we reverse the judgment of invalidity and remand this matter for trial

with respect to both anticipation and obviousness aiti apparently relying on the principle that this court` reviews judgments not opinions' presents extensive argument on appeal relating to prior_art that was not the subject of aitis motions for summary_judgment
that osram discussed these references in osrams motion for summary_judgment of no invalidity-a motion that was denied because it raised disputed material_issues of fact-does not permit aiti to rely on these references on appeal
