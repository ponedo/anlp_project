o.u.r
scientific international inc.` osi' appeals from the decision of the united_states_district_court for the southern_district of new_york denying its motion for summary_judgment of noninfringement of u.s. patent 4,780,898 and granting the cross-motion of elekta_instrument_s.a.` elekta' for summary_judgment of infringement
see elekta_instrument_s.a. v. o.u.r
scientific int l inc. 51_f.supp.2d_478 s.d.n.y.1999
because the district_court erred in concluding as a matter of law that osis rotating gamma system rgs literally infringes claim 1 of the898_patent we reverse

background
elektas898_patent is directed to medical devices known as` gamma_units'
gamma_units are used for treating brain tumors through focused radiation therapy
see elekta 51 f.supp.2d at 479
in a typical gamma_unit multiple beams of radiation are aimed at a single focal_point on a patients brain
see id
at the focal_point the combined energy of the multiple radiation beams destroys abnormal brain tissue
see id
gamma_units generally consist of several components including 1` radiation_sources' i.e. radioactive cobalt isotopes located around the outer surface of a hemispherical radiation_shield ; 2` beam_channels' or narrow holes in the radiation_shield located beneath each radiation source ; 3 a` collimator' located inside the radiation_shield with holes that are aligned with the beam_channels ; and 4 a treatment table for moving a patient in and out of the gamma_unit
see id.at 479-80

the898_patent claims a specific arrangement of radiation_sources and beam_channels that reduces the risk of radiation scatter outside the gamma_unit
see898_patent col._1,_ll._38-43 ; col._3,_ll._8-9
the patent contains one independent claim and five dependent claims
independent claim 1 is the sole claim at issue
during prosecution the examiner initially rejected claim 1 for obviousness
in response the applicant amended claim 1 to read as follows 1
an arrangement in a gamma_unit comprising a plurality of radiation_sources mounted within a radiation_shield and having beam_channels directed radially from said radiation_sources toward a common focal_point said radiation_shield comprising a space for accommodating the head of a patient lying on a support and having an opening the radiation_sources and the beam_channels directed radially from said space toward the focal_point being located in relation to the diametrical_plane extending across the opening to said space only within a zone extending between latitudes 30¢X-45¢X > > as seen from said diametrical_plane
id.at col._3,_ll._16-27 emphasis added
the patent was accordingly granted
figure 4 of the898_patent depicts the arrangement as follows

*1305. ?
according to the written description the novel aspect of this arrangement is that the radiation_sources 8 and the beam_channels 6_and_19 are located in relation to the diametrical_plane across the opening 11 to the radiation_shield 2` within a zone extending to latitudes 30¢X-45¢X > > from said diametrical_plane'
id.at col._1,_ll._44-50
in other words the radiation_sources 8 and beam_channels 6_and_19 are located` within an annular curved zone extending maximally up to latitudes 30¢X > > -45¢X' as seen from the diametrical or vertical plane
see id.at col._2,_ll._16-22 ; col._3,_ll._2-3 emphasis added
as a result none of the radiation_sources 8 and beam_channels 6_and_19 are directed out of the gamma_unit and any radiation beams that pass through the focal_point f will impinge solely upon the radiation_shield 2
see id.at col._3,_ll._3-7

osi offers for sale in the united_states its rgs gamma_unit which has radiation_sources and beam_channels positioned at latitudes ranging from 14¢X > > to 43¢X in relation to the diametrical_plane
see elekta 51 f.supp.2d at 481
elekta sued osi for infringement of claim 1 of the patent
see id.at 479
osi moved for summary_judgment of noninfringement of the patent and elekta cross-moved for summary_judgment of infringement
see id
the district_court denied osis motion and granted elektas cross-motion after interpreting claim 1 as including gamma_units *1306 with radiation_sources and beam_channels located` beginning at the edge of the helmet 0 and extending to a point between 30¢X-45¢X > >' and concluding that osis device literally infringes claim 1 of the898_patent
id.at 485
osi now appeals to this court
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1 1994

standards of review
we review a district_courts grant of summary_judgment de novo
see ethicon endo-surgery inc. v. united_states surgical corp. 149_f.3d_1309 1315 47_uspq2d_1272 1275 fed.cir.1998
in reviewing a denial of a motion for summary_judgment we give considerable deference to the trial_court and` will not disturb the trial_courts denial of summary_judgment unless we find that the court has indeed abused its discretion'
suntiger inc. v. scientific research funding group 189_f.3d_1327 1333 51_uspq2d_1811 1815 fed.cir.1999
summary judgment is appropriate only when there are no genuine issues of material_fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law
see fed.r.civ.p

when both parties move for summary_judgment the court must evaluate each motion on its own merits resolving all reasonable inferences against the party whose motion is under consideration
see mckay v. united_states 199_f.3d_1376 1380 fed.cir.1999
if there are no material_facts in dispute precluding summary_judgment` our task is to determine whether the judgment granted is correct as a matter of law'

a determination of infringement requires a two-step analysis

infringement
osi argues that the district_court erred in interpreting claim 1 of the898_patent to cover gamma_units with radiation_sources and beam_channels located between 0¢X and 30¢X
osi asserts that the claim_language` only within a zone extending between latitudes 30¢X > > -45¢X' unambiguously excludes gamma_units with radiation_sources between 0¢X and 30¢X
osi contends that even though the preferred_embodiment discloses radiation_sources between 0¢X > > to 45¢X claim 1 should be limited to gamma_units with radiation_sources located exclusively between 30¢X to 45¢X because the scope of elektas right to exclude is governed by the language of the claims *1307 not by the written description
osi thus asserts that the district_court erred in concluding as a matter of law that its rgs_device literally infringes claim 1
moreover osi argues that elekta is barred by prosecution_history estoppel from arguing infringement under the doctrine of equivalents because coverage of gamma_units with radiation_sources in the range of 0¢X to 30¢X was surrendered in response to an obviousness rejection

elekta responds that the district_court properly construed claim 1 as covering gamma_units with radiation_sources that are in a zone having an upper boundary between 30¢X to 45¢X
elekta argues that the plain_meaning of the term` extending' is` reaching' which includes 0¢X to 30¢X > > and that the district_courts claim_construction is the only interpretation that is consistent with the claim_language the written description and the prosecution_history
elekta contends that osis proposed interpretation is inconsistent with the drawings and the written description and should not be adopted because it fails to cover the preferred_embodiment and would render the claim invalid
elekta further contends that the district_court properly concluded as a matter of law that osis rgs_device literally infringes claim 1 of the patent

in interpreting claims a court should rely upon` the claim_language the written description portion of the specification the prosecution_history and if necessary to aid the courts understanding of the patent extrinsic evidence'
gentry 134 f.3d at 1476 45 uspq2d at 1500
`` while we have held many times that a patentee can act as his own lexicographer to specifically define terms of a claim contrary to their ordinary_meaning' the written description in such a case must clearly redefine a claim_term` so as to put a reasonable competitor or one reasonably skilled in the art on notice that the patentee intended to so redefine that claim_term'
process control corp. v. hydreclaim corp. 190_f.3d_1350 1357 52_uspq2d_1029 1033 fed.cir.1999
absent an express intent to impart a novel meaning claim_terms take on their ordinary_meaning
see renishaw plc v. marposs societa per azioni 158_f.3d_1243 1249 48_uspq2d_1117 1121 fed.cir.1998

we agree with osi that the district_court erred in interpreting claim 1 to include gamma_units with radiation_sources and beam_channels located` beginning at the edge of the helmet 0¢X and extending to a point between 30¢X-45¢X'
the district_court erred in its claim_construction because it did not accord the claim_language its ordinary_meaning
claim 1 explicitly provides that the radiation_sources and the beam_channels in the gamma_unit are located` only within a zone extending between latitudes 30¢X-45¢X as seen from the diametrical_plane.`
'898_patent col._3,_ll._26-27 emphasis added
when given their ordinary_meaning the terms` only' and` extending between' unambiguously limit claim 1 to gamma_units with radiation_sources and beam_channels located in a zone stretching exclusively in the space separating the latitudes 30¢X > > and 45¢X
see e.g. websters new world dictionary 947 3d ed.1988 defining` only' as` solely ; exclusively' ; see id.at 480 defining` extending' as` to stretch out' ; see id.at 134 defining` between' as` in or through the space that separates two things'
while elekta argues that` extending' should be interpreted as` to reach' rather than` to stretch' we conclude that the key word is` between' and that the ordinary_meaning of the phrase` only within a zone extending between' is inescapable
the claim only encompasses 30¢X-45¢X
any other conclusion renders the reference to 30¢X superfluous

the written description does not convince us otherwise
it is true that while` one may not read a limitation into a claim from the written description.. one may look to the written description to define a term already in a claim limitation for a claim must be read in light of the specification of which it is a part'
*1308 renishaw 158 f.3d at 1248 48 uspq2d at 1120
the parties do not dispute that the written description discloses a gamma_unit with radiation_sources and beam_channels located between the latitudes of 0¢X and 45¢X
see e.g.898_patent col._2,_ll._16-22 ; id.at col._2,_l._64 to col._3,_l._3
however the unambiguous_language of the amended claim controls over any contradictory language in the written description

osi also argues that the prosecution_history provides another reason why claim 1 should be limited to gamma_units with radiation_sources and beam_channels located exclusively between 30¢X and 45¢X
claims that have been narrowed in order to obtain issuance over the prior_art can not later be interpreted to cover that which was previously disclaimed during prosecution
see graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 33 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966) ; southwall technologies inc. v. cardinal ig co. 54_f.3d_1570 1576 34_uspq2d_1673 1676 fed.cir.1995
during prosecution the examiner initially rejected claim 1 for obviousness stating that applicants [ sic ] stated point of novelty is only the elimination of the radiation_sources which are located within a zone that is near or on the longitudinal_plane of the patient
applicant claims his sources within a zone of latitudes from 30¢X-45¢X
but the prior_art_gamma_units have sources which are located within a zone which includes 30¢X-45¢X
applicant does not claim the zone which is exclusively 30¢X > > -45¢X or that his sources specifically are not at latitudes near the longitudinal_plane of the patient
paper_no._10 at 3
in response to the examiners rejection the applicant amended claim 1 as follows with additions indicated by underlining and deletions indicated by brackets 1
( amended an arrangement in a gamma_unit.. the radiation_sources [ 9 ] and the beam_channels [ 6 19 ].. located in relation to the diametrical_plane [ through ] extending across the opening to said face only within a zone extending [ to ] between latitudes 30¢X-45¢X as seen from said diametrical_plane
paper no._14 at 1

elekta argues that those amendments were made to address the examiners concern that the original claims did not incorporate the point of novelty stated in the written description-the elimination of radiation_sources near the longitudinal_plane of the patient 90¢X not the elimination of radiation_sources between 0¢X and 30¢X
while this may explain why the term` only' was added to the claim elektas explanation fails to adequately address the change from the word` to' to` between'
osi responds that the word` to' was changed to` between' in response to the examiners statements that` prior_art_gamma_units have sources which are located within a zone which includes 30¢X-45¢X' and that` applicant does not claim the zone which is exclusively 30¢X-45¢X >'
paper_no._10 at 3
we agree
in view of these statements from the examiner a person of skill in the art would understand that the term` to' was changed to` between' in order to respond to the examiners statement and to distinguish the prior_art by claiming exclusively the range of 30¢X-45¢X >
we therefore agree with osi that claim 1 is susceptible of only one reasonable_construction and is limited to gamma_units with radiation_sources located exclusively between 30¢X-45¢X

elekta argues that osis proposed claim_construction should not be adopted because it would exclude the preferred and only embodiment disclosed in the specification
we have previously stated that` [ s ] uch an interpretation is rarely if ever correct and would require highly persuasive evidentiary support'
vitronics corp. v. conceptronic inc. 90_f.3d_1576 1583 39_uspq2d_1573 1578 fed.cir.1996
that proposition is correct
however in light of the prosecution_history and the unambiguous_language of the amended claim we conclude that this is the rare case in which such an interpretation is compelled

*1309 elekta further argues that osis interpretation would render claim 1 invalid because a gamma_unit with radiation_sources solely between 30¢X-45¢X would be inoperative
we do not reach the issue of invalidity and we note that the record is unclear as to whether such a device would be inoperative
moreover having concluded that the amended claim is susceptible of only one reasonable_construction we can not construe the claim differently from its plain_meaning in order to preserve its validity upon which we do not opine
cf
process control 190 f.3d at 1357 52 uspq2d at 1033` where as here the claim is susceptible to only one reasonable_construction.. we must construe the claims based on the patentees version of the claim as he himself drafted it
``

based on our conclusion that the district_court misconstrued claim 1 we further conclude that the district_court erred in concluding as a matter of law that osis device literally infringes claim 1
it is undisputed that osis rgs_device does not have radiation_sources and beam_channels located exclusively between 30¢X-45¢X
see elekta 51 f.supp.2d at 485` [ a ] ll of [ the rgss ] radiation_sources and channels fall between 14¢X > > and 43¢X`
thus no reasonable_juror could find that osis rgs_device literally infringes claim 1 of the898_patent
accordingly we conclude that the district_court erred in granting elektas motion for summary_judgment of infringement and we reverse the district_courts judgment on that issue.1

finally osi argues that its rgs_device does not infringe claim 1 under the doctrine of equivalents
because this issue was never addressed by the district_court we decline to reach it here on appeal.2

conclusion
for the above reasons we conclude that the district_court erred in construing claim 1 to cover gamma_units with radiation_sources and beam_channels located` beginning at the edge of the helmet 0¢X and extending to a point between 30¢X-45¢X'
properly construed claim 1 is limited to gamma_units with radiation_sources and beam_channels located exclusively between 30¢X and 45¢X
we therefore conclude that no reasonable_juror could find that osis rgs_device literally infringes claim 1 and that the district_court erred in granting elektas motion for summary_judgment of infringement
because the district_court did not address the question whether osis rgs_device infringes claim 1 under the doctrine of equivalents we decline to reach this issue on appeal
accordingly we

osi also appeals the district_courts order denying its motion for summary_judgment of noninfringement
although we ordinarily do not review a denial of such a motion our holding today is tantamount to a reversal of that denial
2
we note however that in light of our claim_construction a finding of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents would seemingly vitiate the clear limitation` only within a zone extending between latitudes 30¢X-45¢X' in claim 1
moreover in view of the prosecution_history elekta would apparently be barred from arguing that osis device infringes under the doctrine of equivalents because it surrendered the range of 0¢X to 30¢X during prosecution
