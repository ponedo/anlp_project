opinion
plager circuit_judge
the li second family limited partnership li 1 filed a patent infringement suit in the united_states_district_court for the eastern_district of virginia against toshiba corporation and toshiba_america_electronic_components inc. collectively toshiba
li alleged that toshiba makes semiconductor_devices using a process that infringes several_claims of lis u.s._patent_no._4946,800 the800_patent
among its defenses toshiba alleged that the800_patent is unenforceable because li and his attorney engaged in inequitable_conduct before the united states patent and trademark office pto
after a bench_trial on the issue the district_court agreed with toshiba and concluded that the800_patent is unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct

background
1
li owns several patents including the800_patent and a related patent u.s._patent_no._4916,513 the513_patent in the area of semiconductor technology
toshibas inequitable_conduct_claim arises from lis alleged_failure to disclose to the examiner of the application that resulted in the800_patent events that occurred during prosecution of the application that resulted in the513_patent

the800_patent issued in 1990 from application serial no._05 /386,102 the102 application which was filed in 1973 as a continuation-in-part cip of a now-abandoned 1971 application serial no._05 /154,300 the300 application
the513_patent issued in 1990 from application serial no._05 /838,758 the758 application which was filed in 1977 also as a cip of the300 application
the102 and758 applications were assigned to different examiners at the pto-the102 application to examiner_saba and the758 application to examiner_larkins
the300 application itself was a cip of a 1968 application that issued in 1971 as u.s._patent_no._3585,714 the714_patent which in turn was a cip of a 1965 *1376 application that issued in 1969 as u.s._patent_no._3430,109 the109_patent

the800_patent is directed to a method for making a semiconductor_device with isolation grooves used to separate regions of the device
more specifically the800_patent claims a method for making a semiconductor_device by forming a semiconductor material substrate of one conductivity type e.g. p-type ; forming on the substrate a semiconductor material body of the opposite conductivity type e.g. n-type thus creating a pn_junction ; and forming an isolation groove in the body extending at least to the pn_junction
all claims of the800_patent include two important limitations the bottom of the groove must be within 0.1 microns of the pn_junction the` 0.1 micron' limitation and the pn_junction must meet the groove at a curved portion of the groove the` rounding' limitation

the513_patent covers subject matter similar to that of the800_patent but its claims are directed to semiconductor structure rather than a method for making semiconductors
in the758 application that resulted in the513_patent all originally filed claims except claim 16 contained a limitation that the bottom of the groove must be within 1.0 micron of the pn_junction the` 1.0 micron' limitation
claim 16 contained the 0.1 micron_limitation found in the claims of the800_patent
also claim 8 as filed contained a limitation similar to the rounding_limitation found in the claims of the800_patent

prosecution of the102 application which resulted in the800_patent continued from its filing_date in 1973 until february 10 1977 when examiner_saba suspended action on the application pending the outcome of an interference proceeding involving the300 application
prosecution of the102 application did not resume until 1984
meanwhile prosecution of the758 application proceeded without suspension

2
during prosecution of the758 application examiner_larkins identified three prior_art_references-peltzer murphy and sanders-that formed the basis for rejections under 35 u.s.c.¡±¡± 102_and_103
in response li attempted to eliminate the three references as prior_art by asserting that in accordance with 35 u.s.c.¡± 120 his claims were entitled to the benefit of the filing_date of either the application that resulted in the714_patent or the application that resulted in the109_patent
examiner_larkins rejected lis arguments finding that the earlier_patents did not disclose subject matter supporting the claims
in september 1979 examiner_larkins issued a final_rejection of all claims in the application

li appealed the final_rejection to the pto board of appeals board2 which also rejected his attempt to establish an earlier priority_date
in a june_17,_1981 decision the board found that table 1 which appeared in the written descriptions of both the109 and714_patent s did not support the 1.0 micron_limitation
joint_app.at 945
even if table 1 supported the 1.0 micron_limitation the parent-the300 application-did not contain or incorporate by reference table 1
joint_app.at 946
upon lis request for reconsideration the board explained that table 1 showed distances both less than and greater than 1.0 micron and that neither the714_patent nor the300 application placed` particular criticality.. upon the less than one micron_feature'
joint_app.at 960
thus the board concluded that the claims of the758 application were not entitled to the benefit of an earlier_filing_date and that therefore peltzer murphy and sanders were available as prior_art_references against the claims
although the board did not explicitly state that the earlier_patents lacked support for the 0.1 micron *1377 limitation it did so implicitly when it concluded that none of the claims including claim 16 with the 0.1 micron_limitation were entitled to an earlier_date
furthermore the reasoning behind the boards decision applies equally to the 0.1 micron_limitation and the 1.0 micron_limitation-no prior patent or application placed any emphasis on the distance between the bottom of the groove and the pn_junction

the board proceeded to sustain examiner_larkinss ¡± 102 rejection of claim 1 as anticipated by peltzer which the board found discloses the 1.0 micron_feature
although the board did not sustain examiner_larkinss ¡± 102 and ¡± 103 rejections of other claims the board entered a new ground of rejection some claims were rejected under ¡± 103 as obvious in view of peltzer and some claims including claim 16 with the 0.1 micron_limitation were rejected under ¡± 103 as obvious in view of sanders
the board explicitly found the 1.0 micron_limitation would have been obvious in view of peltzers disclosure of a groove extending to the pn_junction ; this reasoning would also render the 0.1 micron_limitation obvious
it appears that the board rejected claim 16 over sanders rather than peltzer because sanders disclosed the particular shape of the groove that was claimed in addition to the 0.1 micron_feature
original claim 8 which included the rounding_limitation was ultimately allowed and issued as claim 3 in the513_patent

3
when prosecution of the102 application resumed in 1984 the interference apparently having been discontinued li amended some of the claims to include limitations on the distance between the bottom of the groove and the pn_junction
in rejecting these claims examiner_saba stated that several references including peltzer inherently disclosed such distance_limitations
joint_app.at 639 727
numerous times during prosecution li expressly indicated that the written descriptions of the109 and714_patent s and specifically table 1 supported the distance_limitations
joint_app.at 591-97 599 633
after li amended the claims with distance_limitations to include the 0.1 micron_limitation he continued to assert that his claims were entitled to either the 1965 filing_date of the application for the109_patent or the 1968 filing_date of the application for the714_patent depending on the other limitations in each claim
joint_app.at 657-64 767-68
these earlier priority_dates were enough to overcome some of the cited references including peltzer but not all of them
li argued that the remaining prior_art_references did not sufficiently disclose the distance_limitations
joint_app.at 746

there is no written record of a disclosure to the pto by li of the boards 1981 decision regarding priority_dates in the758 application
li made reference to the758 application only in a genealogy_chart of related_applications that he attached to the last supplemental amendment he filed
joint_app.at 777
having accepted lis argument that the claims of the102 application were entitled to the benefit of an earlier_filing_date examiner_saba allowed the claims stating that the primary reason for allowance was that the 0.1 micron_limitation and the rounding_limitation were not taught in the prior_art available before the 1968 priority_date
joint_app.at 780

4
when li brought suit against toshiba for infringement of the800_patent toshiba raised the defense that the patent was unenforceable due to lis inequitable_conduct in concealing the boards decision regarding the758 application from examiner_saba
after a bench_trial on the issue the district_court held the800_patent unenforceable
the district_court found that li did not adequately disclose the decision to the examiner and that li further committed inequitable_conduct by affirmatively and repeatedly arguing to the examiner that his claims were entitled to the benefit of the earlier_filing_dates
the district_court found that the materiality requirement *1378 was met because examiner_saba allowed the claims only after he was convinced that li was entitled to the earlier_filing_dates
the court rejected lis argument that the boards decision did not apply to the 0.1 micron_limitation
finally the district_court inferred from the high degree of materiality and lis affirmative_misrepresentations that li had the requisite deceptive_intent

discussion
applicants for patents have a duty to prosecute patent_applications in the pto with candor good_faith and honesty
molins plc v. textron inc. 48_f.3d_1172 1178 33_uspq2d_1823 1826 fed.cir.1995 ; see also 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56
a breach of this duty which breach can include affirmative_misrepresentations of material facts failure to disclose material information or submission of false material information coupled with an intent to deceive constitutes inequitable_conduct
see molins 48 f.3d at 1178 33 uspq2d at 1826
in determining whether inequitable_conduct occurred a trial_court must determine whether the party asserting the inequitable_conduct defense has shown by clear and convincing_evidence that the alleged nondisclosure or misrepresentation occurred that the nondisclosure or misrepresentation was material and that the patent_applicant acted with the intent to deceive the pto
glaxo inc. v. novopharm ltd. 52_f.3d_1043 1048 34_uspq2d_1565 1567 fed.cir.1995
the nondisclosure or misrepresentation must meet threshold_levels of both materiality and intent
molins 48 f.3d at 1178 33 uspq2d at 1826
we review all of these underlying factual determinations for clear_error
glaxo 52 f.3d at 1048 34 uspq2d at 1567 ; molins 48 f.3d at 1178 33 uspq2d at 1827

once the threshold_levels of materiality and intent have been established the trial_court must weigh materiality and intent to determine whether the equities warrant a conclusion that inequitable_conduct occurred
id
the more material the information misrepresented or withheld by the applicant the less evidence of intent will be required in order to find that inequitable_conduct has occurred

nondisclosure and misrepresentation
toshibas inequitable_conduct_claim arises from lis alleged_failure during prosecution of the102 application to disclose the boards decision that the claims of the758 application were not entitled to the benefit of the filing_date of any of lis earlier_applications
the district_court concluded that li failed to disclose the boards decision and that he further committed inequitable_conduct by affirmatively misrepresenting to examiner_saba that the claims of the102 application all of which included the 0.1 micron_limitation were entitled to the 1965_or_1968 filing_date of one of the earlier_applications even though he knew the board had reached a contrary result with respect to claims of the758 application

nothing in the102 applications written prosecution record shows that li disclosed directly to examiner_saba that the board had rendered a decision regarding the758 application that might affect the priority_date of the102 claims
although the genealogy_chart filed by li shows the chain of parent_applications and related_applications including the758 application we agree with toshiba and the district_court that the chart does not adequately disclose the relevant information-the boards decision regarding priority_dates
the record shows that li made reference to the genealogy_chart in connection with a discussion of prior_art cited during prosecution of the related_applications
unlike an applicants disclosure of a prior_art reference the content of which is presumed to be before the examiner see in re portola *1379 packaging inc. 110_f.3d_786 790 42_uspq2d_1295 1299 fed.cir.1997 lis submission of the genealogy_chart with reference to the758 application only in the context of prior_art cited in that application and with no mention of the boards decision was not sufficient to disclose the boards decision to examiner_saba
moreover in the same supplemental amendment to which li attached the genealogy_chart li reiterated his assertion that the claims were entitled to filing_dates of parent_applications a statement inconsistent with the boards decision that li purportedly disclosed
we can not say that the district_court clearly erred in finding that there was no adequate written disclosure of the boards decision

li also alleges that his patent attorney mr. kavrukov orally briefed examiner_saba regarding the boards decision
before the district_court li proffered only kavrukovs testimony as evidence that examiner_saba had discussed the boards decision with kavrukov and had told kavrukov that he did not consider the decision relevant to prosecution of the claims in the102 application
the pto requires all business before it to be conducted or at least documented in writing
litton sys. inc. v. whirlpool corp. 728_f.2d_1423 1439 221_uspq_97 106 fed.cir.1984 citing 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.2
it is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure that the substance of any interview with the examiner is included in the written record of the application unless the examiner indicates that he will do so
see id
( citing manual of patent examining procedure ¡± 713.04
in view of our usual deference to the district_court regarding witness credibility see carroll touch inc. v. electro mech
sys. inc. 15_f.3d_1573 1580 27_uspq2d_1836 1842 fed.cir.1993 and the lack of any reference in the written record to a conversation between kavrukov and saba regarding the boards decision we can not say that the district_court committed clear_error in finding that kavrukovs testimony was not credible and that there was no disclosure written or oral to examiner_saba

moreover the district_court not only found that li failed to disclose the boards decision to examiner_saba it also found that li affirmatively and repeatedly argued to examiner_saba that the claims of the102 application were entitled to the benefit of earlier_filing_dates
in view of the boards decision that the 0.1 micron_limitation was not supported by the earlier_patents,3 we agree with toshiba and the district_court that lis repeated statements regarding earlier_filing_dates are properly characterized as affirmative_misrepresentations
thus we discern no clear_error in the district_courts finding that during prosecution of the application that matured into the800_patent li engaged in a persistent_course of nondisclosure and misrepresentation that may constitute inequitable_conduct if the materiality and intent requirements are satisfied

2
materiality
information is deemed material` if there is asubstantial likelihood that a reasonable_examiner would have considered the information important in deciding whether to allow the application to issue as a patent
`` halliburton co. v. schlumberger tech corp. 925_f.2d_1435 1440 17_uspq2d_1834 1839 fed.cir.1991 quoting 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 19894 because the effective_filing_date of each claim in a *1380 patent_application determines which references are available as prior_art for purposes of ¡±¡± 102_and_103 information regarding the effective_filing_date is of the utmost importance to an examiner
consequently an applicants misrepresentation that he is entitled to the benefit of an earlier_filing_date is highly material

in this case the district_court concluded that examiner_saba allowed the claims of the800_patent only after he was convinced that li was entitled to an earlier_filing_date and that therefore the boards decision that similar claims in the758 application were not entitled to the earlier_date was material
while the district_court may have overstated the examiners position it is true that lis misrepresentations regarding priority_dates eliminated from consideration the peltzer_reference which examiner_saba had found disclosed the 0.1 micron_feature and which the board effectively had found disclosed the 0.1 micron_feature
particularly in a case such as this in which an applicants misrepresentation and nondisclosure of priority_date_information eliminates a reference specifically cited by the examiner and previously found by the board to disclose an important feature of the claimed invention there is no doubt that such information is highly material
cf
rohm & haas co. v. crystal chem co. 722_f.2d_1556 1571 220_uspq_289 300 fed.cir.1983` [ t ] here is no room to argue that submission of false_affidavits [ to overcome prior_art ] is not material
``

lis argument that the peltzer_reference is not material is misplaced
the relevant issue is the materiality of the priority_date_information not the materiality of peltzer
lis false statements regarding priority_dates are material because li induced examiner_sabas reliance on those statements during examination
cf
general electro music corp. v. samick music corp. 19_f.3d_1405 1411 30_uspq2d_1149 1154 fed.cir.1994 finding a false statement that the patentee had conducted a prior_art search to be material because it induced reliance by the pto in granting a petition to make special
as a result of that reliance examiner_saba ultimately allowed the claims by considering only references with dates earlier than the priority_dates asserted by li
we can not determine what the outcome of prosecution would have been in the absence of the examiners reliance on lis misrepresentations

even if the materiality of peltzer were at issue lis conclusion that peltzer is not material is erroneous
the board clearly found that peltzer disclosed the 1.0 micron_feature when it sustained examiner_larkinss ¡± 102 rejection of claim 1
as discussed the boards reasoning would also lead to the finding that peltzer disclosed the 0.1 micron_feature
thus peltzer is material because it discloses the 0.1 micron_feature which both li and examiner_saba considered to be an important limitation in the claims

finally li argues that because the claims of the800_patent include the rounding_limitation they are patentable over the prior_art even without the benefit of the earlier_filing_dates
for support li points to the boards decision in the758 application to allow claim 8 which contained the rounding_limitation and notes that the district_court erroneously stated that the board had found that peltzer disclosed the rounding feature
while lis contentions regarding the rounding_limitation may be correct they do not render immaterial the boards decision regarding the 0.1 micron_limitation
information concealed from the pto may be material even though it would not invalidate the patent
see gardco mfg. inc. v. herst lighting co. 820_f.2d_1209 1213 2_uspq2d_2015 2019 fed.cir.1987` the simple fact is that a patent may be valid and yet be rendered unenforceable for misuse or inequitable_conduct`
as stated the test for materiality is whether a reasonable_examiner would have considered the information important not whether the information would conclusively decide the issue of patentability
see a.b
dick co. v. burroughs corp. 798_f.2d_1392 1397 230_uspq_849 853 fed.cir.1986` [ t ] he test for materiality is *1381 not whether there is anticipation or obviousness but rather what areasonable_examiner would consider.. important in deciding whether to allow the application to issue as a patent
`` emphasis and alteration in original
as explained lis nondisclosure of the boards decision and misrepresentation of priority_dates easily satisfy this test
there is no clear_error in the district_courts finding that the boards decision regarding priority_dates was material

3
intent
`` intent [ to deceive the pto ] need not be proven by direct evidence
indeed [ d ] irect proof of wrongful intent is rarely available but may be inferred from clear and convincing_evidence of the surrounding circumstances
`` baxter 149 f.3d at 1329 47 uspq2d at 1230 quoting labounty mfg. inc. v. usitc 958_f.2d_1066 1076 22_uspq2d_1025 1032 fed.cir.1992
when determining whether intent has been shown by clear and convincing_evidence a court must weigh all evidence including evidence of good_faith
baxter 149 f.3d at 1330 47 uspq2d at 1231

the circumstances in this case support the district_courts finding of intent
li not only failed to disclose to examiner_saba the boards decision regarding priority_dates he also made numerous statements during prosecution of the102 application that were contrary to the boards decision
we can infer from lis affirmative_misrepresentations that li deliberately concealed the boards decision from examiner_saba
see rohm 722 f.2d at 1571 220 uspq at 300 inferring deceptive_intent from submission of false_affidavits to overcome prior_art

we are not persuaded by lis arguments that his other actions demonstrate good_faith and lack of deceptive_intent
the genealogy_chart that li attached to a supplemental amendment did not sufficiently disclose the boards decision and was not provided for the purpose of determining priority_dates ; thus we do not see how the chart shows a lack of deceptive_intent
li also argues that his disclosure of the boards decision during prosecution of a later application filed after the800_patent issued is evidence that li lacked deceptive_intent
in akron polymer container corp. v. exxel container inc. 148_f.3d_1380 47_uspq2d_1533_(fed.cir.1998) upon which li relies this court found no deceptive_intent when a patent_applicant disclosed to the examiner of one application the copendency of a second_application but failed to disclose the copendency to the examiner of the second_application
in contrast lis disclosure of the boards decision to the examiner of a third application filed after the102 application issued as the800_patent has no bearing on whether li acted with deceptive_intent during prosecution of the102 application
lis arguments are insufficient to overcome the inference of deceptive_intent and thus we perceive no clear_error in the district_courts finding that li acted with the intent to deceive the pto

4
inequitable conduct
having established that the district_court committed no clear_error in finding that lis conduct met threshold_levels of materiality and intent we conclude that the district_court did not abuse its discretion in determining that lis persistent_course of nondisclosure and misrepresentation constituted inequitable_conduct
accordingly we affirm the district_courts judgment that the800_patent is unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct

conclusion
the decision of the district_court is

affirmed
