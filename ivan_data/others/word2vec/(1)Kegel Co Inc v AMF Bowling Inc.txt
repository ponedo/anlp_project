background
i
the290_patent is directed to various improvements in a bowling_lane_maintenance_machine
such machines are used to maintain the condition of bowling_lanes by applying thin layers of conditioning_oil onto the surfaces of the lanes
the conditioning_oil or` lane_dressing fluid' protects the wooden surface of the bowling_lane from wear caused by friction ; the conditioning_oil also influences how a bowling ball travels down the lane

the american bowling congress enacts rules which specify how to apply conditioning_oil to achieve a favored` lane_profile'
since 1991 bowling_lane operators have followed the` top hat rule' which specifies a lane_profile characterized by light volumes of oil deposited along the outside edges of the lane and heavier volumes of oil in the center of the lane
heavier application of conditioning_oil in the center of the lane can result in higher bowling scores

a bowling_lane_maintenance_machine can automatically travel the length of a bowling_lane
as it moves down the lane it transfers conditioning_oil from a storage_tank to a buffer which then applies the oil to the lane surface
the transfer of oil from the storage_tank to the buffer typically is accomplished by means of a transfer_roller

the290_patent discloses a bowling_lane_maintenance_machine which enables a bowling_lane operator to vary the application of conditioning_oil as the maintenance_machine travels down the lane
in this way the operator is able to achieve a variety of lane_profiles to suit different bowling events
the claimed machine essentially consists of three parts a maintenance_assembly by means of which conditioning_oil is applied to the surface of the bowling_lane ; a propulsion_mechanism which moves the machine down the lane ; and a controller which controls the maintenance_assembly and the propulsion_mechanism
'290_patent col. 1 lines 43-50
it is the maintenance_assembly that is at issue in this case
figure 9 of the290_patent illustrates in sectional view the structure of that assembly

*big_token__1423_figure_9__big_token
?
-- -- -

the storage_tank or lane_dressing reservoir 40 contains conditioning_oil
six shiftable_wick assemblies 46a46f extend along the length of the tank
'290_patent col. 2 line 62-col. 3 line 3
( only wick assembly 46b is shown in figure 9
one end of each wick sits within the storage_tank
the other_end is above the tank in close proximity to the transfer_roller 50
'290_patent col. 3 lines 9-19
attached to each wick through a cable is a solenoid.1 figure 9 shows solenoid s2
when activated by the controller which is not shown in figure 9 a solenoid shifts its corresponding wick through a cable so that the wick is engaged or disengaged from the transfer_roller
the transfer_roller is positioned against the buffer 48
'290_patent col. 2 line 62-col. 3 line 3
thus when a solenoid is activated and shifts its wick to engage the transfer_roller conditioning_oil_moves from the storage_tank through the wick onto the roller
from the transfer_roller the oil_moves to the buffer which applies the oil to the surface of the bowling_lane
the controller is programmed to activate individual_solenoids separately to achieve any desired bowling_lane_profile

the290_patent issued on january 26 1993
it has 18 claims three of which nos._1 7 and 14 are in independent form
claim 7 is representative ; it reads as follows 7
in a bowling_lane_maintenance_machine for applying a lane_dressing to the surface of a bowling_lane the improvement_comprising a maintenance_assembly_comprising_means for storing lane_dressing a rotatable_buffer_means for applying the lane_dressing to the bowling_lane and transfer_means for transferring lane_dressing from said storage_means to said buffer_means said transfer_means including a transfer_roller and a plurality of transversely arrayed_wicks each wick having one end positioned in fluidic_engagement with said storage_means and an opposed_end selectively shiftable between a first_position in engagement with said transfer_roller for transferring lane_dressing to said buffer_means and a second_position disengaged from said transfer_roller for avoiding the transfer of lane_dressing to said buffer_means *1424 said transfer_means further including means for selectively and independently shifting each of said wicks between said first_position and said second_position
'290_patent col. 9 lines 32-52

ii
amf introduced its silver_bullet bowling_lane_maintenance_machine in june of 1992
the silver_bullet_machine has five flexible_wicks each controlled by an individual solenoid
the controller in the original silver_bullet_machine was programmable to allow each wick to shift independently of the other_wicks
prior to the issue date of the290_patent however amf modified the silver_bullet_machine by removing the controllers original memory chip and replacing it with a chip that permitted only a paired or tandem shifting of the two outer and two` track' wicks.2 amf later introduced its century pc bowling_lane_maintenance_machine which is substantially similar to the modified silver_bullet_machine for purposes of this case.3

the kegel_company filed suit against amf on february 1 1993
dba_products_company joined the action as a plaintiff later that year
in its suit kegel alleged that amfs silver_bullet_machine infringed the290_patent
the century pc machine subsequently was added as an accused device
kegel sought both a preliminary and permanent injunction against amf.4 as noted amf denied infringement and counterclaimed that the290_patent was invalid
amf asserted that certain prior_art anticipated or rendered obvious the invention claimed in the290_patent
the asserted prior_art consisted of a bowling_lane_maintenance_machine used at nottkes bowling center in battle_creek michigan the` battle_creek_machine' and a maintenance_machine used at don carter lanes and meadowbrook lanes in fort_worth texas the` fort_worth_machine'

in due course the parties cross-moved for summary_judgment on the issues of infringement and validity
the focus of the motions was claim 7
amf conceded that all the limitations of claim 7 were met in its accused products except one the limitation that the claimed maintenance_assemblys transfer_means include` means for selectively and independently shifting each of said wicks between said first_position and said second_position'
'290_patent col. 9 lines 49-52

the district_court began its infringement analysis by construing the limitation at issue
the court observed that the specification for the290_patent describes a machine which distinctly includes a maintenance_assembly a propulsion_assembly and a control_system
the court interpreted claim 7 to require that each wick have associated with it a separate solenoid
in so doing the court rejected amfs argument that claim 7 should be construed to include the controller which activates the solenoids
the court stated that since claim 7 is directed to the maintenance_assembly` [ h ] ow the controller is programmed is irrelevant to the ability to control each wick via its own_solenoid'
based upon its claim_construction the court concluded that the silver_bullet and century_pc_machines literally infringed claim 7 of the290_patent
the court stated that because each accused machines maintenance_assembly had a one wick/one solenoid_structure` [ e ] ven though certain wicks on the silver_bullet and pc machines operate in tandem each solenoid still selectively and independently shifts its own wick'

the district_court denied amfs cross-motion for summary_judgment of invalidity
addressing the anticipation issue the court determined that` [ n ] either the fort_worth nor battle_creek_machines contained all of *1425 the elements of claim 7 of plaintiffs patent'
in rejecting amfs obviousness argument the court stated that` [ b ] ecause the solenoids activate the wicks in the plaintiffs patent and in the [ battle_creek and fort_worth ] machines the solenoid only activated the tank there are significant_differences between the prior_art and plaintiffs patent'

discussion
i
summary judgment is appropriate when` there is no genuine_issue as to any material_fact and.. the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law'
fed.r.civ.p
56 c
we review the district_courts grant of summary_judgment de novo to determine whether the summary_judgment standard was properly applied
lantech inc. v. keip mach co. 32_f.3d_542 545 31_uspq2d_1666 1669 fed.cir.1994
in this case we agree with the parties that there is no genuine_issue as to a material_fact

on appeal amf argues that we should reverse the district_courts judgment of infringement because the court erred in its claim_construction
when properly construed amf asserts the claims of the290_patent do not read on its silver_bullet and century_pc_machines
alternatively amf contends that if the district_courts claim_construction was correct the court erred in not holding the claims of the290_patent invalid as anticipated under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b or for obviousness under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103
we address the infringement_issue first

ii
determining whether a patent is infringed entails a two-step analysis` first the claim must be properly construed to determine its scope and meaning
second the claim as properly construed must be compared to the accused device or process'
carroll touch inc. v. electro mechanical sys. 15_f.3d_1573 1576 27_uspq2d_1836 1839 fed.cir.1993
claim construction is an issue of law which we review de novo
markman v. westview instruments inc. 52_f.3d_967 979 34_uspq2d_1321 1329 fed.cir.1995 in banc affd 517_u.s._370 116_s.ct._1384 134_l.ed.2d_577_(1996)
comparing the properly construed claims to the accused device or process presents a question of fact
in re hayes microcomputer prods. inc. 982_f.2d_1527 1541 25_uspq2d_1241 1251 fed.cir.1992
the plaintiff has the burden of proving infringement by a preponderance of the evidence
laitram corp. v. rexnord inc. 939_f.2d_1533 1535 19_uspq2d_1367 1369 fed.cir.1991

as noted in the district_court the infringement_issue turned on the limitation in claim 7 which states` said transfer_means further including means for selectively and independently shifting each of said wicks between said first_position and said second_position'
amf argues that the district_court erred by not construing claim 7 in light of the function of the entire bowling_lane_maintenance_machine
specifically according to amf the district_court failed to take into account the teaching of the290_patent that the patented invention provides flexibility by allowing each bowling facility` to be provided with its own distinctive lane_dressing profile if desired'
'290_patent col. 6 lines 36-38
amf asserts that the maintenance_machines control means is critical to achieving this flexibility because it activates the solenoids at programmed distances along the bowling_lane so that` the amount of lane_dressing applied to the lane is controlled in each area of a lane served by a corresponding wick to.. provide the exact desired profile'
'290_patent col. 5 lines 32-38
under these circumstances amf argues as used in claim 7` the functional wordindependently.. must include the control functions performed by the programmable_controller and its associated structure' that are part of the maintenance_machine
under this claim_construction amf urges the silver_bullet and century_pc_machines do not infringe the290_patent because *1426 their controllers are only programmed to operate wicks in tandem

for its part kegel argues that the district_court did not err in its claim_construction
it contends that the limitation at issue refers to` the function of the shifting means recited in the limitation moving each wick by its own_solenoid not to the function of the unclaimed control means choosing which solenoid to activate'
kegel takes the position that the290_patents specification describes the claimed machine in terms of three discrete assemblies the maintenance_assembly the propulsion_system and the control_system
for this reason kegel argues` the structure and function of the control means are not a part of the maintenance_assembly even though the control means is indeed part of the overall machine'
for the reasons which follow we conclude that the district_court did not err in construing claim 7

in determining the proper construction of a claim` the court should look first to the intrinsic_evidence of record i.e. the patent itself including the claims the specification and if in evidence the prosecution_history'
vitronics corp. v. conceptronic inc. 90_f.3d_1576 1582 39_uspq2d_1573 1576 fed.cir.1996
we have described such intrinsic_evidence as` the most significant source of the legally operative meaning of claim_language'
id
extrinsic evidence e.g. expert testimony also may be used in claim_construction
id
however when` an analysis of the intrinsic_evidence alone will resolve any ambiguity in a disputed claim_term' it is improper to rely on extrinsic_evidence
id
90 f.3d at 1583 39 uspq2d at 1577
in this case the district_court did not consider and the parties have not directed us to any extrinsic_evidence

the claim_construction_issue presented in this case is whether the limitation of claim 7 that the transfer_means include` means for selectively and independently shifting each of said wicks' encompasses the function performed by the maintenance_machines programmable_controller
we begin the claim_construction process by considering the words of the claim itself
see bell communications research inc. v. vitalink communications corp. 55_f.3d_615 619-20 34_uspq2d_1816 1819 fed.cir.1995
claim 7 is in both jepson_form and the means-plus-function_format of 35 u.s.c.¡± 112_para._6
jepson_form allows a patentee to use the preamble to recite` elements or steps of the claimed invention which are conventional or known'
37 c.f.r.¡± 1.75 e 1996
recently in rowe v. dror 112_f.3d_473 42_uspq2d_1550_(fed.cir.1997) we stated that` [ w ] hen this form is employed the claim preamble defines not only the context of the claimed invention but also its scope'
id
112 f.3d at 479 42 uspq2d at 1553
as we recognized in rowe the fact that the patentee has chosen the jepson_form of the claim evidences the intention` to use the preamble to define in part the structural elements of his claimed invention'
id
thus we conclude that the invention of claim 7 consists of the maintenance_machine in combination with the improvement to the maintenance_assembly
cf pentec inc. v. graphic controls corp. 776_f.2d_309 315 227_uspq_766 770 fed.cir.1985 stating that` the claimed invention consists of the preamble in combination with the improvement'

turning to the language of claim 7 the preamble and the first_paragraph of the claim provide as follows 7
in a bowling_lane_maintenance_machine for applying a lane_dressing to the surface of a bowling_lane the improvement_comprising a maintenance_assembly_comprising_means for storing lane_dressing a rotatable_buffer_means for applying the lane_dressing to the bowling_lane and transfer_means for transferring lane_dressing from said storage_means to said buffer_means
'290_patent col. 9 lines 32-39

the subject of claim 7 is a specified_improvement in a bowling_lane_maintenance_machine
the specified_improvement is` a maintenance_assembly' having three parts means for storing lane_dressing ; a rotatable *1427 buffer_means ; and transfer_means
the scope of the three-part improvement is defined by the word` assembly'
without an express intent to impart a novel_meaning to a claim_term the term takes on its ordinary meaning
york prods. inc. v. central tractor farm and family center 99_f.3d_1568 1572 40_uspq2d_1619 1622 fed.cir.1996 ; hoganas ab v. dresser indus. inc. 9_f.3d_948 951 28_uspq2d_1936 1938 fed.cir.1993 ; smithkline_diagnostics inc. v. helena lab corp. 859_f.2d_878 882 8_uspq2d_1468 1471 fed.cir.1988
the290_patent discloses no novel_meaning for the term` assembly'
when used in the context in which it appears in claim 7` assembly' ordinarily means` a collection of parts so assembled as to form a complete machine structure or unit of a machine'
websters third new international dictionary 131 1986
thus the use of the word` assembly' indicates that in claim 7 the inventors intended to claim a physical_structure

the remaining two paragraphs of the claim describe the transfer_means of the maintenance_assembly said transfer_means including a transfer_roller and a plurality of transversely arrayed_wicks each wick having one end positioned in fluidic_engagement with said storage_means and an opposed_end selectively shiftable between a first_position in engagement with said transfer_roller for transferring lane_dressing to said buffer_means and a second_position disengaged from said transfer_roller for avoiding the transfer of lane_dressing to said buffer_means said transfer_means further including means for selectively and independently shifting each of said wicks between said first_position and said second_position
'290_patent col. 9 lines 40-52

the transfer part of the structure comprising the maintenance_assembly of claim 7 is expressed in means-plus-function_format under 35 u.s.c.¡± 112_para._6
in construing means-plus-function language in a claim a court` must look to the specification and interpret that language in light of the corresponding structure material or acts described therein and equivalents thereof..' in re donaldson co. 16_f.3d_1189 1190 29_uspq2d_1845 1849 fed.cir.1994 in banc5

turning to the specification the summary of the invention states that` [ b ] roadly speaking the preferred machine includes a lane_maintenance_assembly a propulsion_mechanism.. and a controller for controlling the maintenance_assembly and propulsion_mechanism'
'290_patent col. 1 lines 43-50
thus the invention is described as consisting of three separate and distinct elements the lane_maintenance_assembly the propulsion_mechanism and the controller
as seen above the improvement of claim 7 of the patent is directed to the maintenance_assembly

in the first_paragraph of the detailed description of the preferred embodiment the specification defines the subcombinations in the machine the housing the maintenance_assembly the propulsion_assembly and the control_system
'290_patent col. 2 lines 35-38
referring to figure 9 of the patent the specification states that the elements in the maintenance_assembly include lane_dressing reservoir 40 reservoir fill tube 42 reservoir overflow tube 44 shiftable_wick assemblies 46a-46f buffer 48 transfer_roller 50 and solenoids s1-s6
'290_patent col. 2 line 62-col. 3 line 3
the specification refers to the entire maintenance_assembly as a single_element for reference labeled` 14'
'290_patent col. 2 lines 35-38
the propulsion_system *1428 and the control_system are each described separately in the specification
'290_patent col. 3 line 23-col. 5 line 38
the specification refers to the propulsion_assembly as a single_element for reference labeled` 16'
'290_patent col. 3 line 20 figure 4
it also refers to the control_system as a single_element for reference labeled` 18.`
'290_patent col. 4 line 37 figure 14

amf argues that both kegel and the district_court ignore the broad disclosure of the290_patent
specifically amf asserts that` how each wick is shifted into and out of engagement with the transfer_roller.. must be considered when construing the claimed invention'
in support of its argument amf points to two statements in the written specification
first amf notes the following statement controller 124 also activates solenoids s1-6 at programmed distances of travel along the bowling_lane these distances being indicated by the lane distance sensor 128
in this way the amount of lane_dressing applied to the lane is controlled in each area of a lane served by a corresponding wick 45 a-f to provide the exact desired profile
'290_patent col. 5 lines 32-38
amf also notes the statement in the specification that` [ d ] epending upon the desired profile of lane_dressing application data is entered into controller 124 to activate and deactivate solenoids s1-6 at selected distances of travel along the lane as indicated by sensor 128'
'290_patent col. 6 lines 28-31

we are not persuaded by amfs argument
we agree with amf that in the claimed invention it is the controller that activates the solenoids to shift the wicks so that conditioning_oil is applied to the transfer_roller
what stands squarely in the way of amfs overall claim_construction however is the language of claim 7 and the text of the relevant portions of the specification discussed above
based upon that language and text we conclude as did the district_court that the improvement claimed in claim 7 lies solely in the physical_structure of the maintenance_assembly
in other words the controller which is a separate and distinct subassembly or subcombination is not part of the` means for selectively and independently shifting' each of the wicks in the maintenance_assembly of claim 7
in the invention of claim 7 each wick is shifted` selectively and independently' by its own corresponding solenoid

finally turning to the prosecution_history of the290_patent amf asserts that the inventors distinguished their invention over the prior_art by pointing to functions that would employ the controller described in the specification
amf refers specifically to applicants preliminary amendment which states as follows` the present invention allows a much wider degree of flexibility in that structure is provided for bringing each independent wick into and out of operative fluid transferring engagement
thus the lane_profile may be adjusted not only transversely across the lane but also longitudinally along the lane'
we do not believe however that this statement is helpful to amf
in our view the statement only serves to further buttress what we have determined is the correct construction of claim 7
the fact that the inventors stated that the` structure' of their invention served to provide flexibility supports the conclusion that the language` means for selectively and independently shifting each of said wicks' refers to the solenoids not the programmed controller
the claimed invention is able to alter the lane_profile as the machine travels down the bowling_lane because the one-wick/one-solenoid_structure allows it to do so

as noted the district_court found that amfs silver_bullet and century_pc_machines literally infringed claim 7 of the290_patent
infringement of a claim with limitations in mean-plus-function form requires that the accused device perform the identical function at issue and incorporate the structure disclosed in the specification or its structural equivalent as the means for performing that function
intellicall inc. v. *1429 phonometrics inc. 952_f.2d_1384 1388-89 21_uspq2d_1383 1387 fed.cir.1992

amf argues that its silver_bullet and century_pc_machines do not infringe
amf contends that because it has programmed each machines controller so that the solenoids at the ends of the machine always engage and disengage the two end wicks in tandem the silver_bullet and century_pc_machines fail to meet the claim limitation that the maintenance_assemblys transfer_means include means for` selectively and independently' shifting each wick
according to amf the fact that the silver_bullet and century_pc_machines could be reengineered with new controllers so that their solenoids and wicks function in a way that would meet the limitations of claim 7 does not constitute infringement

the problem with this argument is that it is premised on the construction of claim 7 urged by amf which we have rejected
it is true that` a device does not infringe simply because it is possible to alter it in a way that would satisfy all the limitations of a patent_claim'
high tech med instrumentation inc. v. new image indus. 49_f.3d_1551 1555 33_uspq2d_2005 2008 fed.cir.1995
the silver_bullet and century_pc_machines however do not require alteration in order to infringe claim 7 as properly construed
there is no factual dispute that the silver_bullet and century_pc_machines have a solenoid for each wick
none of the wicks are connected together in order to prevent each solenoid in the maintenance_assembly from` selectively and independently' shifting its wick
regardless of the way in which the silver_bullet and century pc controllers are programmed the wicks in the machines are shifted by their individual_solenoids

iii
finally amf argues that the district_court erred in granting summary_judgment in favor of kegel on the validity issue
amf contends that according to the district_courts claim_construction which we have held is correct the290_patent is invalid by reason of anticipation under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b or for obviousness under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103

invalidity must be established by facts supported by clear and convincing_evidence

v. the west bend co. 76_f.3d_1185 1189 37_uspq2d_1685 1687 fed.cir.1996

`` [ c ] laims must be interpreted and given the same meaning for purposes of both validity and infringement analyses'
smithkline_diagnostics v. helena laboratories corp. 859_f.2d_878 882 8_uspq2d_1468 1471 fed.cir.1988

the battle_creek_machine upon which amf relies for anticipation was the product of a modification of an earlier amf machine
to construct the battle_creek_machine a mechanic cut the single lane_dressing storage_tank of an amf century 100 machine into three separate sections or tanks
there then was attached to each tank a wick
each wick was attached so that one of its ends was submerged in conditioning_oil in its tank while the other_end remained exposed outside the tank
at the same time each of the three tanks had its own_solenoid
when a tanks solenoid was activated the solenoid caused the tank to move or` rock' against the machines transfer_roller thereby bringing the exposed end of the tanks wick into contact with the roller
this action caused conditioning_oil from the tank to be applied to the transfer_roller and then transferred from the roller to the machines buffer for application to the lane

the district_court rejected amfs anticipation argument
in so doing it stated as follows [ t ] he battle_creek_machine fails to include at least three significant limitations of *big_token__1430_claim_7__big_token 1 the` means for storing lane_dressing' i.e. a stationary tank for storing lane_dressing or equivalent structure ; 2` each wick having one end positioned in fluidic_engagement with said storage_means and an opposed_end selectively shiftable between a first_position in engagement with said transfer_roller ;' and 3` means for selectively and independently shifting each of said wicks between said first_position and said second_position'

we conclude that the battle_creek_machine does not anticipate the invention claimed in the290_patent for the third reason stated by the district_court
as discussed above in the maintenance_assembly of claim 7 each solenoid activates its individual wick so that the end of the wick that is outside the` storage_means' or` lane_dressing reservoir 40' is brought into contact with the transfer_roller by being` bent into engagement with the..
roller'
'290_patent
col. 3 lines 16-17

the specification states that in the maintenance_assembly of claim 7 each solenoid when activated causes the wick to bend or flex in and out of contact with the transfer_roller
this bending is achieved by the use of springs that` bias [ the ] wick assemblies'
thus we interpret the` means for selectively and independently shifting each of said wicks' limitation as referring to` shiftable_wick assemblies' which in turn refer to the combination of the solenoids biasing springs and the flexible_wicks
see290_patent col. 2 line 66-col. 3 line 19 describing the wicks as` flexible_wicks' that are` bent into engagement with the transfer_roller' and when not in contact with the transfer_roller are` in a more straightened position spaced from the transfer_roller'
without the combination of these elements the hardware could not be controlled in order to` select' between the on and off positions of the wicks

in contrast to the` flexible_wicks' of the claimed invention the battle_creek_machine wicks are rigid
they are not the equivalent of` flexible_wicks' because they change positions not by flexing but rather by being dragged by a movable tank from one position to the other
because we conclude that` means for selectively and independently shifting each of said wicks..' limitation necessitates the use of a` flexible_wick' and because we conclude that the stiff wick/moveable tank assembly of the prior_art battle_creek_machine is not the equivalent of a` flexible_wick' we hold that claim 7 is not anticipated by the battle_creek_machine

amfs final argument on appeal is that the district_court erred in not holding claim 7 obvious in view of the battle_creek and fort_worth_machines
the district_courts determination as to obviousness under section 103 is a question of law which we review de novo
roton barrier inc. v. stanley works 79_f.3d_1112 1127 37_uspq2d_1816 1828 fed.cir.1996
the ultimate determination as to obviousness is based on four underlying factual inquiries 1 the scope and content of the prior_art ; 2 the differences between the claims and the prior_art ; 3 the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art ; and 4 secondary considerations if any of nonobviousness

we have already described the battle_creek_machine
like the battle_creek_machine the fort_worth_machine was the result of a modification of amfs century 100 machine
the modification was different however
the fort_worth_machine had a single tank to hold lane conditioning fluid with a series of individual transversely arrayed_wicks affixed along the lip of the tank
upon activation of a single solenoid the tank was rocked to bring the wicks into contact with a transfer_roller
the fort_worth_machine also had an additional feature
that feature consisted of a second solenoid and a bar that moved in response to activation of that solenoid
when the fort_worth_machine was in operation the bar could be moved against the center_wick of the series of wicks affixed to the lip of the tank
in this way the center_wick could be held *1431 against the transfer_roller when the tank was rocked back through activation of its solenoid and the other_wicks were thereby disengaged from the roller
holding the center_wick against the transfer_roller in this way would of course result in more oil being applied to the center of the bowling_lane than to its sides

the district_court determined that` [ b ] ecause the solenoids actuate the wicks in the plaintiffs patent and in the [ battle_creek and fort_worth_machines ] the solenoid only actuated the tank there are significant_differences between the prior_art and the plaintiffs patent'
the court further determined that even when amfs evidence was viewed in a light most favorable to it the evidence did not show that the level of skill in the art was such that` the claimed invention would have been obvious over the battle_creek and fort_worth_machines'
accordingly the district_court concluded amf` can not prove by clear and convincing_evidence that the claimed invention would have been obvious to one ordinarily skilled in the art at the time the invention was made'

we agree with the district_court that the differences between the maintenance_assembly disclosed in claim 7 of the290_patent and the maintenance assemblies of the battle_creek and fort_worth_machines are` significant'
the teaching of the battle_creek_machine is to use solenoids to rock three separate tanks in order to bring the wicks that are affixed to the tanks into contact with a transfer_roller
the teaching of the fort_worth_machine is twofold 1 to use a tank that is rocked by solenoid action to bring wicks that are affixed to the lip of the tank into contact with a transfer_roller ; and 2 in this arrangement to use a bar to hold the center_wick of the array of wicks in engagement with the transfer_roller after the tank is rocked away from the transfer_roller
we believe that kegel is correct in arguing that` [ t ] he first_suggestion of solving the top hat problem by doing away with a tank that rocks is the kegel_invention' and that` the first_suggestion of using multiple wicks where only the tips are shifted off and on the transfer_roller by respective solenoids is the kegel_invention'
we will not disturb the district_courts holding of nonobviousness

conclusion
for the foregoing reasons the district_courts grant of summary_judgment in favor of kegel on both the issues of infringement and validity is affirmed

a solenoid is a coiled wire that produces an electromagnetic_field when carrying a current
placed within the range of the electromagnetic_field a conductive object will move in response to the application of electric current to the coiled wire
a solenoid is typically used in this manner as a mechanical switch

the` track' wicks in the modified amf silver_bullet are the wicks immediately on either side of the center_wick

as noted the claim_construction_issue presented in this case is whether the limitation of claim 7 that the transfer_means include` means for selectively and independently shifting each of said wicks' encompasses the function performed by the maintenance_machines programmable_controller
the pertinent inquiry in this case is whether after looking to the specification the claim_language covers the control_system in the machine
amf does not contend that the court failed to consider any equivalents to the corresponding structure described in the specification
thus although claim 7 is in means-plus-function_format the case does not present an issue that is unique to such claims` whether a determination of equivalents under ¡± 112_para._6 is a question of law or fact'
