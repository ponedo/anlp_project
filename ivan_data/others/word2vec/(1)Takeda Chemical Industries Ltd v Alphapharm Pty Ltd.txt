alphapharm pty. ltd. and genpharm inc. collectively` alphapharm' appeal from the decision of the united_states_district_court for the southern_district of new_york following a bench_trial that u.s._patent 4,687,777 was not shown to be invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103
takeda chem indus. ltd. v. mylan labs. 417_f.supp.2d_341 s.d.n.y.2006
because we conclude that the district_court did not err in determining that the claimed compounds would not have been obvious in light of the prior_art and hence that the patent has not been shown to be invalid we affirm

background
diabetes is a disease that is characterized by the bodys inability to regulate blood_sugar
it is generally caused by inadequate levels of insulin-a hormone produced in the pancreas
insulin allows blood_sugar or glucose which is derived from food to enter into the bodys cells and be converted into energy
there are two types of diabetes known as type 1 and type 2
in type 1 diabetes the pancreas fails to produce insulin and individuals suffering from this type of diabetes must regularly receive insulin from an external source
in contrast type 2 diabetic_individuals produce insulin
however their bodies are unable to effectively use the insulin that is produced
this is also referred to as insulin_resistance
as a result glucose is unable to enter the cells thereby depriving the body of its main source of energy
type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes-affecting over 90 % of diabetic_individuals

in the 1990s a class of drugs known as thiazolidinediones` tzds' was introduced on the market as a treatment for type 2 diabetes
takeda_chemical_industries ltd. and takeda_pharmaceuticals_north_america inc. collectively` takeda' first invented certain tzds in the 1970s
takedas research revealed that tzds acted as insulin sensitizers i.e. compounds that ameliorate insulin_resistance
although the function of tzds was not completely understood tzds appeared to lower blood glucose levels by binding to a molecule in the nucleus of the cell known as ppargamma which activates insulin receptors and stimulates the production of glucose transporters
takeda 417 f.supp.2d at 348-49
the transporters then travel to the cellular surface and enable glucose to enter the cell from the bloodstream
id

takeda developed the drug actosthe_r which is used to control blood_sugar in patients who suffer from type 2 diabetes
actosthe_r has enjoyed substantial commercial success since its launch in 1999
by *1353 2003 it held 47 % of the tzd market and gross sales for that year exceeded $ 1.7 billion
id.at 386
the active ingredient in actosthe_r is the tzd compound pioglitazone a compound claimed in the patent in suit

takeda owns u.s._patent 4,687,777 the` ¡¬777_patent` entitled` thiazolidinedione derivatives useful as antidiabetic_agents'
the patent is directed to` compounds which can be practically used as antidiabetic agents having a broad_safety_margin between pharmacological effect and toxicity or unfavorable side reactions'
¡¬777_patent col.1 ll.34-37
the asserted claims are claims 1 2 and 5
claim 1 claims a genus of compounds
claim 5 claims pharmaceutical compositions containing that genus of compounds
those claims read as follows 1
a compound of the formula

?
or a pharmacologically acceptable_salt thereof
5
an antidiabetic composition which consists essentially of a compound of the formula ?
or a pharmacologically acceptable_salt thereof in association with a pharmacologically acceptable carrier excipient or diluent
id. claims 1 & 5
for purposes of this appeal the critical portion of the compound structure is the left_moiety of the molecule namely the ethyl-substituted pyridyl_ring.1 that chemical_structure which has an ethyl substituent c2 h5 pictorially drawn to the center of the pyridyl_ring indicates that the structure covers four possible compounds viz. compounds with an ethyl substituent located at the four available positions on the pyridyl_ring
takeda 417 f.supp.2d at 360
the formula includes the 3-ethyl compound 4-ethyl compound 5-ethyl compound pioglitazone and 6-ethyl compound

*big_token__1354_claim_2__big_token of the ¡¬777_patent covers the single compound pioglitazone
that claim which depends from claim 1 reads 2
a compound as claimed in claim 1 wherein the compound is 5- { 4- [ 2- 5-ethyl-2-pyridyl ethoxy ] benzyl } -2,4-thiazolidinedione
¡¬777_patent claim 2
pioglitazone is referred to as the 5-ethyl compound_because the ethyl substituent is attached to the 5-position on the pyridyl_ring

?
alphapharm a generic drug manufacturer filed an abbreviated new drug application` anda' pursuant to the hatch-waxman act seeking u.s. food and drug administration` fda' approval under 21 u.s.c.¡± 355 j et seq
to manufacture and sell a generic version of pioglitazone
alphapharm filed a paragraph iv certification with its anda pursuant to ¡± 505 j 2 b ii asserting that the ¡¬777_patent is invalid as obvious under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103
in response takeda sued alphapharm along with three other generic drug manufacturers who also sought fda approval to market generic pioglitazone alleging that the defendants have infringed or will infringe the ¡¬777_patent

on january 17 2006 the district_court commenced a bench_trial solely on the issues of validity and enforceability of the ¡¬777_patent
alphapharm advanced its invalidity argument asserting that the claimed compounds would have been obvious at the time of the alleged invention
alphapharms obviousness contention rested entirely on a prior_art tzd compound that is referenced in table 1 of the ¡¬777_patent as compound_b
the left_moiety of compound_b consists of a pyridyl_ring with a methyl ch3 group attached to the 6-position of the ring
that portion of its chemical_structure is illustrated as follows

?
alphapharm asserted that the claimed compounds would have been obvious over compound_b

the district_court found that alphapharm failed to prove by clear and convincing_evidence that the asserted claims were invalid as obvious under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103
the court first concluded that there was no motivation in the prior_art to select compound_b as the lead_compound for antidiabetic_research and that the prior_art taught away from its use
as such the court concluded that alphapharm failed to make a prima_facie_case of obviousness
the court continued its analysis and found that even if alphapharm succeeded in making a prima_facie_showing takeda would still prevail because any prima_facie_case of obviousness was rebutted by the unexpected_results of pioglitazones nontoxicity
the court then rendered judgment in favor of takeda
the district_court also held that the ¡¬777_patent had not been procured though inequitable conduct
that decision has been separately appealed and has been affirmed in a decision issued today

alphapharm timely appealed
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

discussion
a
standard of review
in this appeal we are presented with one issue namely whether the asserted *1355 claims of the ¡¬777_patent would have been obvious under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 at the time the invention was made
an invention is not patentable inter alia` if the differences between the subject_matter sought to be patented and the prior_art are such that the subject_matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary_skill in the art'
35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a
because a patent is presumed to be valid 35 u.s.c.¡± 282 the evidentiary burden to show facts supporting a conclusion of invalidity which rests on the accused infringer is one of clear and convincing_evidence
ak steel corp. v. sollac & ugine 344_f.3d_1234 1238-39 fed.cir.2003
whether an invention would have been obvious under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 is a` question of law reviewed de novo based upon underlying factual questions which are reviewed for clear error following a bench_trial'
alza corp. v. mylan labs. inc. 464_f.3d_1286 1289 fed.cir.2006

b. obviousness
alphapharm raises three main arguments in support of its contention that the claims would have been obvious
first alphapharm asserts that the district_court misapplied the law particularly the law governing obviousness in the context of structurally similar chemical_compounds
according to alphapharm the record established that compound_b was the most effective antidiabetic compound in the prior_art and thus the court erred by failing to apply a presumption that one of ordinary_skill in the art would have been motivated to make the claimed compounds
alphapharm asserts that such a conclusion is mandated by our case_law including our en banc decision in in re dillon 919_f.2d_688_(fed.cir.1990)
second alphapharm argues that the court erred in determining the scope and content of the prior_art in particular whether to include the prosecution_history of the prior ¡¬779_patent
lastly alphapharm assigns error to numerous legal and factual determinations and certain evidentiary rulings that the court made during the course of the trial

takeda responds that the district_court correctly determined that alphapharm failed to prove by clear and convincing_evidence that the asserted claims are invalid as obvious
takeda contends that there was overwhelming evidence presented at trial to support the courts conclusion that no motivation existed in the prior_art for one of ordinary_skill in the art to select compound_b as a lead_compound and even if there was that the unexpected_results of pioglitazones improved toxicity would have rebutted any prima_facie_showing of obviousness
takeda further argues that all of alphapharms remaining challenges to the district_courts legal and factual rulings are simply without merit

we agree with takeda that the district_court did not err in concluding that the asserted claims of the ¡¬777_patent would not have been obvious
the supreme_court recently addressed the issue of obviousness in ksr international co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007)
the court stated that the graham v. john deere co. of kansas city 383_u.s._1 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966) factors still control an obviousness_inquiry
those factors are 1` the scope and content of the prior_art' ; 2 the` differences between the prior_art and the claims' ; 3` the level of ordinary_skill in the pertinent art' ; and 4 objective evidence of nonobviousness
ksr 127 s.ct.at 1734 quoting graham 383 u.s. at 17-18 86_s.ct._684

in a thorough and well-reasoned opinion albeit rendered before ksr was decided *1356 by the supreme_court the district_court made extensive findings of fact and conclusions of law as to the four graham factors
alphapharms arguments challenge the courts determinations with respect to certain of these factors which we now address

1
differences between the prior_art and the claims
a
selection of compound_b as lead compound
alphapharms first argument challenges the courts determination with regard to the` differences between the prior_art and the claims'
alphapharm contends that the court erred as a matter of law in holding that the ethyl-substituted tzds were nonobvious in light of the closest_prior_art_compound compound_b by misapplying the law relating to obviousness of chemical_compounds

we disagree
our case_law concerning prima_facie obviousness of structurally similar_compounds is well-established
we have held that` structural_similarity between claimed and prior_art subject_matter proved by combining references or otherwise where the prior_art gives reason or motivation to make the claimed compositions creates a prima_facie_case of obviousness'
dillon 919 f.2d at 692
in addition to structural_similarity between the compounds a prima_facie_case of obviousness also requires a showing of` adequate support in the prior_art' for the change in structure
in re grabiak 769_f.2d_729 731-32 fed.cir.1985

we elaborated on this requirement in the case of in re deuel 51_f.3d_1552 1558 fed.cir.1995 where we stated that` [ n ] ormally a prima_facie_case of obviousness is based upon structural_similarity i.e. an established structural relationship between a prior_art_compound and the claimed compound'
that is so because close or established` [ s ] tructural relationships may provide the requisite motivation or suggestion to modify known compounds to obtain new compounds'
id
a known compound may suggest its homolog analog or isomer because such compounds` often have similar_properties and therefore chemists of ordinary_skill would ordinarily contemplate making them to try to obtain compounds with improved properties'
id
we clarified however that in order to find a prima_facie_case of unpatentability in such instances a showing that the` prior_art would have suggested making the specific_molecular_modifications necessary to achieve the claimed invention' was also required
id
( citing in re jones 958_f.2d_347_(fed.cir.1992) ; dillon 919_f.2d_688 ; grabiak 769_f.2d_729 ; in re lalu 747_f.2d_703_(fed.cir.1984)

that test for prima_facie obviousness for chemical_compounds is consistent with the legal principles enunciated in ksr.2 while the ksr_court rejected a rigid application of the teaching suggestion or motivation` tsm' test in an obviousness_inquiry the court acknowledged the importance of identifying` a reason that would have prompted a person of ordinary_skill in the relevant field to combine *1357 the elements in the way the claimed new invention does' in an obviousness determination
ksr 127 s.ct.at 1731
moreover the court indicated that there is` no necessary inconsistency between the idea underlying the tsm test and the graham analysis'
id
as long as the test is not applied as a` rigid and mandatory' formula that test can provide` helpful insight' to an obviousness_inquiry
id
thus in cases involving new chemical_compounds it remains necessary to identify some reason that would have led a chemist to modify a known compound in a particular manner to establish prima_facie obviousness of a new claimed compound

we agree with takeda and the district_court that alphapharm failed to make that showing here
alphapharm argues that the prior_art would have led one of ordinary_skill in the art to select compound_b as a lead_compound
by` lead_compound' we understand alphapharm to refer to a compound in the prior_art that would be most promising to modify in order to improve upon its antidiabetic activity and obtain a compound with better activity.3 upon selecting that compound for antidiabetic_research alphapharm asserts that one of ordinary_skill in the art would have made two obvious chemical changes first homologation i.e. replacing the methyl_group with an ethyl_group which would have resulted in a 6-ethyl compound ; and second` ring-walking' or moving the ethyl substituent to another position on the ring the 5-position thereby leading to the discovery of pioglitazone
thus alphapharms obviousness_argument clearly depends on a preliminary_finding that one of ordinary_skill in the art would have selected compound_b as a lead_compound

the district_court found however that one of ordinary_skill in the art would not have selected compound_b as the lead_compound
in reaching its determination the court first considered takedas u.s._patent 4,287,200 the` ¡¬200_patent` which was issued on september 1 1981 and its prosecution_history
the court found that the ¡¬200_patent` discloses hundreds of millions of tzd_compounds
`` 4 takeda 417 f.supp.2d at 378
the patent specifically identified fifty-four compounds including compound_b that were synthesized according to the procedures described in the patent but did not disclose experimental data or test_results for any of those compounds
the prosecution_history however disclosed test_results for nine specific_compounds including compound_b
that information was provided to the examiner in response to a rejection in order to show that the claimed compounds of the ¡¬ 200 patent were superior to the known compounds that were disclosed in a cited reference
the court however found nothing in the ¡¬200_patent or in its file_history to suggest to one of ordinary_skill in the art that those nine compounds out of the hundreds of millions of compounds covered by the patent application were the best performing compounds as antidiabetics and hence targets for modification to seek improved properties
id.at 375

*1358 the court next considered an article that was published the following year in 1982 by t. sodha et al
entitled` studies on antidiabetic_agents
ii
synthesis of 5- [ 4- 1-methylcyclohexylmethoxy -benzyl ] thiazolidine-2,4-dione add-3878 and its derivatives'` sodha_ii'
the sodha_ii_reference disclosed data relating to hypoglycemic activity and plasma triglyceride lowering activity for 101 tzd_compounds
those compounds did not include pioglitazone but included compound_b
significantly sodha_ii identified three specific_compounds that were deemed most favorable in terms of toxicity and activity
notably compound_b was not identified as one of the three most favorable compounds
on the contrary compound_b was singled out as causing` considerable_increases in body_weight and brown_fat_weight'

the court also considered takedas ¡¬779_patent
that patent covers a subset of compounds originally included in the ¡¬200_patent application namely tzd_compounds` where the pyridyl or thiazolyl groups may be substituted'
id.at 353
the broadest claim of the ¡¬779_patent covers over one million compounds
id.at 378
compound_b was specifically claimed in claim 4 of the patent
the court noted that a preliminary_amendment in the prosecution_history of the patent contained a statement that` the compounds in which these heterocyclic_rings are substituted have become important especially [ compound_b ]'
id

based on the prior_art as a whole however the court found that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would not have selected compound_b as a lead_compound for antidiabetic_treatment
although the prosecution_history of the ¡¬779_patent included the statement that characterized compound_b as` especially important' the court found that any suggestion to select compound_b was essentially negated by the disclosure of the sodha_ii_reference
the court reasoned that one of ordinary_skill in the art would not have chosen compound_b notwithstanding the statement in the ¡¬779_patent_prosecution_history` given the more exhaustive and reliable scientific analysis presented by sodha_ii which taught away from compound_b and the evidence from all of the tzd patents that takeda filed contemporaneously with the ¡¬779 [ p ] atent showing that there were many promising broad avenues for further research'
id.at 380

the court found that the three compounds that the sodha_ii_reference identified as` most favorable' and` valuable for the treatment of maturity-onset diabetes' not compound_b would have served as the best` starting_point for further_investigation' to a person of ordinary_skill in the art
id.at 376
because diabetes is a chronic disease and thus would require long term treatment the court reasoned that researchers would have been dissuaded from selecting a lead_compound that exhibited negative effects such as toxicity or other adverse side effects especially one that causes` considerable_increases in body_weight and brown_fat_weight'
id.at 376-77
thus the court determined that the prior_art did not suggest to one of ordinary_skill in the art that compound_b would be the best candidate as the lead_compound for antidiabetic_research

admissions from alphapharm witnesses further buttressed the courts conclusion
dr._rosenberg head of alphapharms intellectual property department testified as a 30 b 6 witness on behalf of alphapharm
in discussing sodha_ii dr._rosenberg admitted that there was nothing in *1359 the article that would recommend that a person of ordinary_skill in the art choose compound_b over other_compounds in the article that had the same efficacy rating
dr._rosenberg acknowledging that compound_b had the negative side effects of increased body_weight and brown fat also admitted that a compound with such_side_effects would` presumably not' be a suitable candidate compound for treatment of type ii diabetes
alphapharms expert dr._mosberg concurred in that view at his deposition when he admitted that a medicinal chemist would find such_side_effects` undesirable'

moreover another alphapharm 30 b 6 witness barry spencer testified at his deposition that in reviewing the prior_art one of ordinary_skill in the art would have chosen three compounds in sodha_ii as lead_compounds for research not solely compound_b
in addition takedas witness dr. morton testified that at the time sodha_ii was published it was known that obesity contributed to insulin_resistance and type 2 diabetes
thus one of ordinary_skill in the art would have concluded that sodha_ii taught away from pyridyl_compounds because it associated adverse side effects with compound_b

we do not accept alphapharms assertion that ksr as well as another case recently decided by this court pfizer inc. v. apotex inc. 480_f.3d_1348_(fed.cir.2007) mandates reversal
relying on ksr alphapharm argues that the claimed compounds would have been obvious because the prior_art_compound fell within` the objective reach of the claim' and the evidence demonstrated that using the techniques of homologation and ring-walking would have been` obvious to try'
additionally alphapharm argues that our holding in pfizer where we found obvious certain claims covering a particular acid-addition salt directly supports its position

we disagree
the ksr_court recognized that` [ w ] hen there is a design need or market pressure to solve a problem and there are a finite number of identified predictable_solutions a person of ordinary_skill has good reason to pursue the known options within his or her technical grasp'
ksr 127 s.ct.at 1732
in such_circumstances` the fact that a combination was obvious to try might show that it was obvious under ¡± 103'
id
that is not the case here
rather than identify predictable_solutions for antidiabetic_treatment the prior_art disclosed a broad selection of compounds any one of which could have been selected as a lead_compound for further_investigation
significantly the closest_prior_art_compound compound_b the 6-methyl exhibited negative properties that would have directed one of ordinary_skill in the art away from that compound
thus this case fails to present the type of situation contemplated by the court when it stated that an invention may be deemed obvious if it was` obvious to try'
the evidence showed that it was not obvious to try

similarly alphapharms reliance on pfizer fares no better
in pfizer we held that certain claims covering the besylate_salt of amlodipine would have been obvious
the prior_art included a reference referred to as the berge reference that disclosed a genus of pharmaceutically acceptable_anions that could be used to form pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts as well as other publications that disclosed the chemical characteristics of the besylate_salt
pfizer 480 f.3d at 1363
noting that our conclusion was based on the` particularized facts of this case' we found that the prior_art provided *1360` ample motivation to narrow the genus of 53 pharmaceutically-acceptable_anions disclosed by berge to a few including benzene sulphonate'
id.at 1363 1367
here the court found nothing in the prior_art to narrow the possibilities of a lead_compound to compound_b
in contrast the court found that one of ordinary_skill in the art would have chosen one of the many compounds disclosed in sodha_ii of which there were over ninety that` did not disclose the existence of toxicity or side effects and to engage in research to increase the efficacy and confirm the absence of toxicity of those compounds rather than to choose as a starting_point a compound with identified adverse effects'
thus pfizer does not control this case

based on the record before us we conclude that the district_courts fact-findings were not clearly erroneous and were supported by evidence in the record
moreover we reject the assertion that the court failed to correctly apply the law relating to prima_facie obviousness of chemical_compounds
because alphapharms obviousness_argument rested entirely on the court making a preliminary_finding that the prior_art would have led to the selection of compound_b as the lead_compound and alphapharm failed to prove that assertion the court did not commit reversible_error by failing to apply a presumption of motivation
we thus conclude that the court did not err in holding that alphapharm failed to establish a prima_facie_case of obviousness
see eli_lilly & co. v. zenith goldline pharms. 471_f.3d_1369_(fed.cir.2006) affirming the district_courts finding of nonobviousness upon concluding in part that the prior_art_compound would not have been chosen as a lead_compound

b
choice of the claimed compounds
even if alphapharm had established that preliminary_finding and we have concluded that it did not the record demonstrates that alphapharms obviousness_argument fails on a second ground
the district_court found nothing in the prior_art to suggest making the specific_molecular_modifications to compound_b that are necessary to achieve the claimed compounds
in reaching that conclusion the court first found that the process of modifying lead_compounds was not routine at the time of the invention
takeda 417 f.supp.2d at 380
dr._mosberg opined that the steps of homologation and ring-walking were` routine steps in the drug optimization process' but the court found that testimony unavailing in light of the contrary more credible testimony offered by takedas experts
id.at 381
in addition the court relied on dr._rosenbergs admission that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would` look at a host of substituents such as chlorides halides and others not just methyls' in modifying the pyridyl_ring
id

pioglitazone differs from compound_b in two respects and one would have to both homologate the methyl_group of compound_b and move the resulting ethyl_group to the 5-position on the pyridyl_ring in order to obtain pioglitazone
with regard to homologation the court found nothing in the prior_art to provide a reasonable_expectation that adding a methyl_group to compound_b would reduce or eliminate its toxicity
based on the test_results of the numerous compounds disclosed in sodha_ii the court concluded that` homologation had no tendency to decrease unwanted side effects' and thus researchers would have been inclined` to focus research efforts elsewhere'
id.at 383
indeed several other_compounds exhibited similar or better potency than compound_b and one compound in particular compound 99 that had no identified problems differed significantly *1361 from compound_b in structure
id.at 376_n._51
moreover dr._mosberg agreed with takedas expert dr. danishefsky that the biological activities of various substituents were` unpredictable' based on the disclosure of sodha_ii
id.at 384-85
the court also found nothing in the ¡¬200 and ¡¬779_patent s to suggest to one of ordinary_skill in the art that homologation would bring about a reasonable_expectation of success

as for ring-walking the court found that there was no reasonable_expectation in the art that changing the positions of a substituent on a pyridyl_ring would result in beneficial changes
dr._mosberg opined that the process of ring-walking was` known' to takeda but the court found that testimony inapt as it failed to support a reasonable_expectation to one of ordinary_skill in the art that performing that chemical change would cause a compound to be more efficacious or less toxic
id.at 382
moreover dr._mosberg relied on the efficacy data of phenyl compounds in sodha_ii but the court found those data insufficient to show that the same effects would occur in pyridyl_compounds

alphapharm relies on in re wilder 563_f.2d_457_(ccpa_1977) for the proposition that differences in a chemical compounds properties resulting from a small change made to the molecule are reasonably expected to vary by degree and thus are insufficient to rebut a prima_facie_case of obviousness
in wilder our predecessor court affirmed the boards holding that a claimed compound which was discovered to be useful as a rubber antidegradant and was also shown to be nontoxic to human_skin would have been obvious in light of its homolog and isomer that were disclosed in the prior_art
the evidence showed that the homolog was similarly nontoxic to the human_skin whereas the isomer was toxic
the court held that` one who claims a compound per se which is structurally similar to a prior_art_compound must rebut the presumed expectation that the structurally similar_compounds have similar_properties'
id.at 460
while recognizing that the difference between the isomers toxicity and the nontoxicity of the homolog and claimed compound` indicate [ d ] some degree of unpredictability' the court found that the appellant failed to` point out a single actual difference in properties between the claimed compound and the homologue' and thus failed to rebut the presumption
wilder 563 f.2d at 460

we would note that since our wilder decision we have cautioned` that generalization should be avoided insofar as specific chemical_structures are alleged to be prima_facie obvious one from the other' grabiak 769 f.2d at 731
in addition to this caution the facts of the present case differ significantly from the facts of wilder
here the court found that pioglitazone exhibited unexpectedly superior properties over the prior_art_compound_b. takeda 417 f.supp.2d at 385
the court considered a report entitled` preliminary studies on toxicological effects of ciglitazone-related compounds in the rats' that was presented in february 1984 by dr. takeshi fujita then-chief scientist of takedas biology research lab and co-inventor of the ¡¬777_patent
that report contained results of preliminary toxicity studies that involved selected compounds including pioglitazone and compound_b
compound_b was shown to be` toxic to the liver heart and erythrocytes among other things' whereas pioglitazone was` comparatively potent' and` showed no statistically significant toxicity'
id.at 356-57
during the following months takeda performed *1362 additional toxicity studies on fifty compounds that had been already synthesized and researched by takeda including pioglitazone
the compounds were tested for potency and toxicity
the results were presented in another report by fujita entitled` pharmacological and toxicological studies of ciglitazone and its analogues'
pioglitazone was shown to be the only compound that exhibited no toxicity although many of the other_compounds were found to be more potent
id.at 358

thus the court found that there was no reasonable_expectation that pioglitazone would possess the desirable property of nontoxicity particularly in light of the toxicity of compound_b
the courts characterization of pioglitazones unexpected_results is not clearly erroneous
as such wilder does not aid alphapharm because unlike the homolog and claimed compound in wilder that shared similar_properties pioglitazone was shown to differ significantly from compound_b of which it was not a homolog in terms of toxicity
consequently takeda rebutted any presumed expectation that compound_b and pioglitazone would share similar_properties

alphapharm also points to a statement takeda made during the prosecution of the ¡¬779_patent as evidence that there was a reasonable_expectation that making changes to the pyridyl region of compound_b would lead to` better toxicity than the prior_art'
during prosecution of the ¡¬779_patent in response to an enablement rejection takeda stated that` there should be no reason in the instant case for the examiner to doubt that the claimed compounds having the specified substituent would function as a hypolipidemic and hypoglycemic agent as specified in the instant disclosure'
that statement however indicates only that changes to the left_moiety of a lead_compound would create compounds with the same properties as the compounds of the prior_art ; it does not represent that lower toxicity would result
and even if the statement did so represent it does not refer to any specific substituent at any specific position of tzds left_moiety as particularly promising
as the court correctly noted the compounds disclosed in the ¡¬ 779 patent included a variety of substituents including lower alkyls halogens and hydroxyl groups attached to a pyridyl or thiazolyl group
as discussed supra the district_court found that the claims encompassed over one million compounds
thus we disagree with alphapharm that that statement provided a reasonable_expectation to one of ordinary_skill in the art that performing the specific steps of replacing the methyl_group of the 6-methyl compound with an ethyl_group and moving that substituent to the 5-position of the ring would have provided a broad_safety_margin particularly in light of the district_courts substantiated findings to the contrary

we thus conclude that alphapharms challenges fail to identify grounds for reversible_error
the court properly considered the teachings of the prior_art and made credibility determinations regarding the witnesses at trial
we do not see any error in the district_courts determination that one of ordinary_skill in the art would not have been prompted to modify compound_b using the steps of homologation and ring-walking to synthesize the claimed compounds
because the courts conclusions are not clearly erroneous and are supported by the record evidence we find no basis to disturb them

the court properly concluded that alphapharm did not make out a prima_facie_case of obviousness because alphapharm *1363 failed to adduce evidence that compound_b would have been selected as the lead_compound and even if that preliminary showing had been made it failed to show that there existed a reason based on what was known at the time of the invention to perform the chemical modifications necessary to achieve the claimed compounds

in light of our conclusion that alphapharm failed to prove that the claimed compounds would have been prima_facie obvious we need not consider any objective indicia of nonobviousness.5

scope and content of the prior_art
alphapharm also assigns error to the district_courts determination regarding the scope and content of the prior_art
alphapharm asserts that the court excluded the prosecution_history of the ¡¬779_patent from the scope of the prior_art after wrongly concluding that it was not accessible to the public
takeda responds that the court clearly considered the ¡¬779_patent_prosecution_history which was admitted into evidence on the first day of testimony
takeda urges that the courts consideration of the prosecution_history is apparent based on its extensive analysis of the ¡¬779_patent and the file_history that appears in the courts opinion

we agree with takeda that the district_court did not err in its consideration of the scope of the prior_art
as discussed above the court considered the prosecution_history and even expressly considered one of the key statements in the prosecution_history upon which alphapharm relies in support of its position that compound_b would have been chosen as the lead_compound
takeda 417 f.supp.2d at 378
in considering the prosecution_history of the ¡¬779_patent the court noted that takeda filed a preliminary_amendment on march_15,_1983 in which its prosecuting attorney stated that` the compounds in which these heterocyclic_rings are substituted have become important especially [ the 6-methyl compound ]'
id
the court rejected alphapharms assertion that that statement supported the conclusion that compound_b would have been selected as a lead_compound
rather the court found that viewing the prior_art as a whole the prior_art showed` that takeda was actively conducting research in many directions and had not narrowed its focus to compound_b'
id.at 379
thus while the district_court may have incorrectly implied that prosecution_histories are not accessible to the public see id.at n. 59 see also custom accessories inc. v. jeffrey-allan indus. 807_f.2d_955_(fed.cir.1986)` [ t ] he person of ordinary_skill is a hypothetical person who is presumed to be aware of all the pertinent prior_art' the court nonetheless considered the prosecution_history of the ¡¬779_patent in its obviousness analysis and accorded proper weight to the statements contained therein
thus any error committed by the court in this regard was harmless error

we have considered alphapharms remaining arguments and find none that warrant reversal of the district_courts decision

*1364 conclusion
we affirm the district_courts determination that claims 1 2 and 5 of the ¡¬ 777 patent have not been shown to have been obvious and hence invalid

affirmed

concurring opinion filed by circuit_judge_dyk
dyk circuit_judge concurring
i join the opinion of the court insofar as it upholds the district_court judgment based on a determination that a claim to pioglitazone the 5-ethyl compound would be non-obvious over the prior_art
the problem is that only one of the three claims involved here-claim 2-is limited to pioglitazone
in my view the breadth of the other two claims claims 1_and_5 of u.s._patent_no._4867,777` ¡¬777_patent` -which are also referenced in the judgment-renders them likely invalid

all of the compounds claimed in claims 1 2_and_5 were included in generic claims in the prior_art u.s._patent_no._4287,200` ¡¬200_patent`
unfortunately our law concerning when a species is patentable over a genus claimed in the prior_art is less than clear
it is of course well established that a claim to a genus does not necessarily render invalid a later claim to a species within that genus
see eli_lilly & co. v. bd
of regents of univ
of wash. 334_f.3d_1264 1270 fed.cir.2003
in my view a species should be patentable over a genus claimed in the prior_art only if unexpected_results have been established
our case_law recognizes the vital importance of a finding of unexpected_results both in this context and in the closely related context where a prior_art_patent discloses a numerical range and the patentee seeks to claim a subset of that range
see application of petering 49_c.c.p.a._993 301_f.2d_676 683 1962 species found patentable when genus claimed in prior_art because unexpected properties of the species were shown ; see also pfizer inc. v. apotex inc. 480_f.3d_1348 1371 fed.cir.2007 relying on lack of unexpected_results in determining that species claim was obvious in view of prior_art genus claim ; in re woodruff 919_f.2d_1575 1578 fed.cir.1990 when applicant claims a subset of a range disclosed in a prior_art_patent the applicant must generally show that` the claimed range achieves unexpected_results relative to the prior_art range
``

while the 5-ethyl compound pioglitazone is within the scope of the ¡¬200_patent there is clear evidence as the majority correctly finds of unexpected_results regarding that compound and therefore its validity is not in question on this ground
however at oral argument the patentee admitted that the prior_art ¡¬200_patent also generically covers the 6-ethyl compound which is within the scope of claims 1_and_5 of the ¡¬777_patent and admitted that there is no evidence of unexpected_results for the 6-ethyl compound
under such_circumstances i believe that the 6-ethyl is likely obvious and consequently claims 1_and_5 are likely invalid for obviousness
however the argument as to the overbreadth of claims 1_and_5 has been waived because it was not raised in the opening brief
in any event as a practical matter the judgment finding that the appellants filing of the anda for pioglitazone is an infringement and barring the making of pioglitazone is supported by the finding that claim 2 standing alone is not invalid and is infringed

we note that the supreme_court in its ksr opinion referred to the issue as whether claimed subject_matter` was' or` was not' obvious
since 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 uses the language` would have been obvious' and the supreme_court in ksr did consider the particular time at which obviousness is determined we consider that the court did not in ksr reject the standard statutory formulation of the inquiry whether the claimed subject_matter` would have been obvious at the time the invention was made'
35 u.s.c.¡± 103
hence we will continue to use the statutory` would have been' language

the parties do not dispute that compound_b was the closest_prior_art_compound
thus the legal question is whether or not the claimed subject_matter would have been obvious over that compound
we will however use alphapharms terminology of` lead_compound' in this opinion deciding the appeal as it has been argued

the concurrence while agreeing that the question of the` overbreadth' of claims 1_and_5 has been waived states further that the 6-ethyl compound which is within the scope of claims 1_and_5 has not been shown to possess unexpected_results sufficient to overcome a prima_facie_case of obviousness and hence claims 1_and_5 are likely invalid as obvious
since waiver is sufficient to answer the point being raised no further comment need be made concerning its substance
