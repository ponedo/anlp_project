we reverse as we find that the claims in the patents-in-suit would have been obvious as a matter of law

background
the patents at issue in this case cover hitch_pin_locks that secure trailers to cars and sport utility vehicles
a hitch_pin secures a draw bar or tow ball mount to a hitch_receiver attached to a motor_vehicle
the hitch_pin passes through aligned_apertures in the trailer_hitch_receiver and draw bar in order to secure the two members together
the patents describe a barbell-shaped lock with a stop_portion on one end a locking head on the other end and a shank_portion which passes through the aligned_apertures of the hitch_receiver and the towball mount

the use of a lock in a trailer_hitch_receiver was well known in the art prior to the ¡¬115 and ¡¬426_patent s. like the patented_inventions u.s._patent_no._5664,445 the` chang_patent' discloses a lock with a lock_head a shackle having a stop_member a shank and a latch
the lock is shown being used as a hitch_pin_lock
the following figure shows the prior_art configuration

the patents-in-suit claim improvements to the prior_art_locks
the ¡¬115_patent and ¡¬426_patent 1 collectively` the sleeve_patents' claim a hitch_pin_lock having a removable_sleeve to increase the shanks diameter and a method for providing a hitch_pin_lock with a removable_sleeve on the shank.big_token__2_figure_5__big_token of the ¡¬115_patent depicts the claimed invention

the claimed sleeve slides over the shank of the hitch_pin_lock increasing the diameter *1235 of the shank and enabling use with trailer_hitch_receivers of different apertures see ¡¬115_patent abstract particularly the 1/2 inch and 5/8 inch apertures that are the industry standard for certain towing applications
the ¡¬115_patent touts the inventions primary benefit namely its size_adaptability
id
col.1 ll.15-18 col.2 ll.20-36 45-47
the removeable sleeve is not claimed to improve the locking or towing functions but is claimed to be desirable because it allows for` a single locking unit [ to ] be used for a number of varied size locking requirements' id
col.2 ll.32-34 thus saving retailers shelf space
claim 15 of the ¡¬115_patent is representative 15
a locking hitch_pin_device for interconnecting a hitch_bar with a hitch_receiver said bar and receiver each including apertures disposed therein for receiving the hitch_pin_device said device comprising a a hitch_pin_shank having first and second end portions and a thickness_dimension ; b a latch_portion disposed at said first end portion ; c a locking head_member moveable between locked and unlocked_states and configured for selective_engagement with said latch_portion ; d a stop_member disposed at said second end portion ; e a sleeve for selective_engagement with said hitch_pin_shank to selectively vary the thickness_dimension thereof to match the size diameter of the hitch_bar and the receiver apertures to permit snug engagement therewith ; and
( f a retaining apparatus operative to resist removal of said sleeve from said hitch_pin_shank when said locking head_member is in the unlocked_state and removed from said latch_portion
¡¬115_patent_col.10 ll.21-41

¡¬426_patent_col.11 ll.17-20
the specifications for the ¡¬115_patent and ¡¬426_patent are very similar
the ¡¬649_patent claims an improved locking device with an external_seal designed to insulate the locking mechanism of the lock from the ingress of contaminants
¡¬649_patent col.7 ll.13-15
claim 1 of the ¡¬649_patent is representative 1
a locking device comprising a a shackle member including 1 an elongated shank_portion having a longitudinally extending axis 2 a stop_portion at a first end of said shank_portion and
( 3 a latch_portion at a second end of said shank_portion said shank_portion having an outer_surface_margin adjacent to said latch_portion ; b a locking head including a casing having a surrounding sidewall_surface and a generally flat transverse inner head face with an entryway sized and adapted to mate with said latch_portion in a longitudinal axial direction and a locking mechanism disposed in said casing said locking mechanism being moveable between
( 1 a locked state to lockably retain said latch_portion in said locking head when said latch_portion is in an engaged_state and
( 2 an unlocked_state to release said latch_portion therefrom ; and

a major manufacturer master_lock offered for sale locks that allegedly fell within the claims of the ¡¬115 ¡¬426 and ¡¬649_patent s. in april of 2006 wyers filed this lawsuit ultimately asserting infringement of claims 15 19 21 and 24 of the ¡¬115_patent claim 1 of the ¡¬426_patent and claims 1 9 and 11 of the ¡¬649_patent3 the case was tried to a jury over nine days in march of 2009
at the close of evidence the district_court granted wyers motions for jmol on infringement
master_lock contended however that all of the patents-in-suit would have been obvious over the prior_art
at trial wyers admitted that both the chang and johnson references disclosed every limitation of the ¡¬115 and ¡¬426_patent claims except the use of the sleeve to adjust the operative_thickness of the shank
moreover it was undisputed that wyers own trimax t2 and t3 barbell-shaped locks on sale prior to the ¡¬115_patent priority date also satisfied every limitation of the asserted claims of the ¡¬115 and ¡¬426_patent s but those for the sleeve
master_lock asserted that the sleeve claims would have been obvious over the combination of the prior_art locking devices inter alia in combination with u.s._patent_no._3963,264 the` down_patent' or in combination with master_locks 37d padlock
thus as the district_court described the relevant question for the jurys consideration with respect to the asserted sleeve patent claims was` whether master_lock presented clear and convincing_evidence that the use of a sleeve to adjust the operative_thickness of a shank would have been obvious'
see jmol_order 2009_wl_1309774 at *3

similarly the external_seal is concededly the only feature of the ¡¬649 seal_patent that distinguishes it from the chang_patent and the ¡¬832_patent4 master_lock argued that the patented_device would have been obvious over the combination of the prior_art locking devices with any of the following the master_lock 6121 padlock u.s._patent_no._5156,029 the` heald_patent' u.s._patent_no._3858,419 the` hampton_patent' and u.s._patent_no._3848,440 the` manuel_patent'
thus as the district_court noted the sole question for the jurys consideration with respect to the seal_patent was` whether master_lock presented clear and convincing_evidence that the use of an external flat flange seal would have been obvious'
see jmol_order 2009_wl_1309774 at *5

*1237 the question of obviousness on the disputed claims of the ¡¬ 115 patent the ¡¬426_patent and the ¡¬649_patent was submitted to the jury which returned a verdict finding that the asserted claims were not obvious and awarded wyers $ 5.35 million in damages as a reasonable royalty
the district_court granted wyers motion for a continuing injunction against master_lock for future infringement and entered judgment in favor of wyers in the form of a 24 % royalty for any infringing products master_lock has sold or does sell prior to the effective date of the injunction plus $ 1,137,920 in pre-judgment interest

may_28,_2009 judgment
after trial master_lock renewed its jmol motion on obviousness
the district_court denied the motion and upheld the jury_verdict
jmol_order 2009_wl_1309774 at *3
master_lock timely appealed and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

discussion
a patent is invalid for obviousness` if the differences between the subject_matter sought to be patented and the prior_art are such that the subject_matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary_skill in the art to which said subject_matter pertains'
35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a
obviousness is a question of law based on underlying findings of fact
in re kubin 561_f.3d_1351 1355 fed.cir.2009
the underlying factual inquiries include 1 the scope and content of the prior_art 2 the differences between the prior_art and the claims at issue 3 the level of ordinary_skill in the art and 4 any relevant secondary_considerations such as commercial_success long felt but unsolved needs and the failure of others
graham v. john_deere_co. 383_u.s._1 17-18 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966)
here the scope of the claims of the patents in suit are not at issue and the level of skill of one of ordinary_skill in the art is not contested
the primary factual issues alleged to be in dispute are 1 whether the prior_art_references are in the same_field of endeavor as the patented_invention ; 2 whether there was sufficient motivation to combine the references ; and 3 the existence and significance of pertinent secondary_considerations
we address each in turn

i relevant prior art
two criteria are relevant in determining whether prior_art is analogous` 1 whether the art is from the same_field of endeavor regardless of the problem addressed and 2 if the reference is not within the field of the inventors endeavor whether the reference still is reasonably pertinent to the particular problem with which the inventor is involved'
comaper corp. v. antec inc. 596_f.3d_1343 1351 fed.cir.2010 quoting in re_clay 966_f.2d_656 658-59 fed.cir.1992
whether a reference in the prior_art is` analogous' is a fact_question
in re_clay 966 f.2d at 658

with respect to the sleeve_patents the district_court concluded that the jury could implicitly find that the down_patent was outside the scope of the relevant art
see jmol_order 2009_wl_1309774 at *3
however the down_patent is specifically directed to a trailer-towing application adaptable to` a motor_vehicle such as an automobile for towing by fitting a rear towing attachment for releasably attaching the tow-bar of a trailer such as a boat_trailer horse_box caravan or other_vehicle'
down_patent_col.1 ll.9-12
thus the down_patent is clearly within the same_field of endeavor as the sleeve_patents

with respect to the seal_patent the district_court concluded that the jury could *1238 implicitly find that padlock_seals were not relevant_prior_art
jmol_order 2009_wl_1309774 at *5
the district_court instructed the jury without objection that obviousness must be determined` based on the perspective of a person of ordinary_skill in the field of locksmithing'
j.a
3332
given that this jury instruction appears to define the field of endeavor as` locksmithing' there is no reason why padlocks should be excluded from the relevant_prior_art
tellingly the ¡¬649_patent itself refers to` the prior_art padlock' in the background of the invention
¡¬649_patent_col.1 ll.24
moreover the ¡¬649_patent itself defines its scope broadly and makes clear that the claims are directed to` locking device [ s ]' generally
see id
col.1 ll.9 col.4 ll.65-66

even if the prior_art_padlocks were not within the same_field of endeavor they are nonetheless clearly` reasonably pertinent' to the problem that the inventor was trying to solve
see in re_clay 966 f.2d at 659
the supreme_courts decision in ksr_international_co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007) directs us to construe the scope of analogous art broadly stating that` familiar items may have obvious uses beyond their primary purposes and a person of ordinary_skill often will be able to fit the teachings of multiple patents together like pieces of a puzzle'
id.at 402 127_s.ct._1727 emphasis added
here the prior_art_padlocks were clearly directed toward the same problem the inventor was trying to solve in the ¡¬649_patent namely preventing the ingress of contaminants into the locking mechanism
thus as a matter of law the prior_art down_patent and the padlock_seals were pertinent_prior_art in the ¡¬649_patent and the district_court erred in finding that they were not
we need not determine whether the master_lock 37d was pertinent_prior_art

ii motivation to combine
the second question for our consideration is whether there was motivation to combine the sleeve with the prior_art_barbell_locks and similarly whether there was motivation to combine the prior_art_locks with an external_sealing_mechanism
before the supreme_courts decision in ksr we required that a patent challenger show that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have had motivation to combine the prior_art_references and would have had a reasonable_expectation of success in doing so
see pharmastem_therapeutics inc. v. viacell inc. 491_f.3d_1342 1360 fed.cir.2007 ; noelle v. lederman 355_f.3d_1343 1351-52 fed.cir.2004
we had also held that` [ t ] he reason suggestion or motivation to combine may be found explicitly or implicitly 1 in the prior_art_references themselves ; 2 in the knowledge of those of ordinary_skill in the art that certain references or disclosures in those references are of special interest or importance in the field ; or 3 from the nature of the problem to be solved'
ruiz v. a.b
chance co. 234_f.3d_654 665 fed.cir.2000 ; see in re dembiczak 175_f.3d_994 999 fed.cir.1999
ksr however instructs courts to take a more` expansive and flexible approach' in determining whether a patented_invention was obvious at the time it was made
550 u.s. at 415 127_s.ct._1727
in particular the court emphasized the role of` common_sense'` [ r ] igid preventative rules that deny factfinders recourse to common_sense.. are neither necessary under our case_law nor consistent with it'
id.at 421 127_s.ct._1727

before ksr we had also consistently treated the question of motivation to combine prior_art_references as a question of fact
see e.g. alza_corp. v. mylan labs. inc. 464_f.3d_1286 1289 fed.cir.2006 ; *1239 in re gartside 203_f.3d_1305 1316 fed.cir.2000
while ksr did not change this rule ksr and our later_cases establish that the question of motivation to combine may nonetheless be addressed on summary_judgment or jmol in appropriate circumstances
see ksr 550 u.s. at 427 127_s.ct._1727 ; perfect_web techs. inc. v. infousa inc. 587_f.3d_1324 1330 fed.cir.2009 ; ball_aerosol & specialty container inc. v. limited brands inc. 555_f.3d_984 993 fed.cir.2009 ; muniauction inc. v. thomson corp. 532_f.3d_1318 1325-26 fed.cir.2008 ; sundance inc. v. demonte fabricating ltd. 550_f.3d_1356 1366-67 fed.cir.2008

ksr featured fairly straightforward technology-an adjustable throttle pedal for an automobile u.s._patent_no._6237,565` the engelgau_patent'
the patented_technology combined an adjustable_pedal with an electronic_sensor to measure the pedal depression
both features were present in the prior_art namely u.s._patent_no._5010,782` asano' disclosing an adjustable_pedal and u.s. patent 5,819,593` rixon' disclosing an electronic_sensor for detecting the pedals position
when teleflex inc.` teleflex' sued ksr_international company` ksr' for infringement the district_court invalidated the engelgau_patent on summary_judgment on the grounds of obviousness
teleflex inc. v. ksr_int l_co. 298_f.supp.2d_581 595 e.d.mich.2003
this court reversed holding that there were genuine issues of material_fact as to whether there was a teaching suggestion or motivation to combine the prior_art_references
teleflex inc. v. ksr_int l_co. 119_fed.appx._282 290 fed.cir.2005
the supreme_court reversed again concluding that summary_judgment was appropriate
this was so because one skilled in the art starting with asano would have found it obvious to put the sensor on a fixed pivot point and one skilled in the art starting with rixon would have found it obvious to avoid the problem of wire-chafing by combining rixon with the adjustable_pedal of asano
ksr 550 u.s. at 423-24 127_s.ct._1727

the court also made clear that expert_testimony concerning motivation to combine may be unnecessary and even if present will not necessarily create a genuine issue of material_fact
see id.at 427 127_s.ct._1727
we had held that the district_court erred in granting summary_judgment as the affidavits of teleflexs two experts stating their opinion that the invention was non-obvious created a material issue of fact
we had noted that` [ a ] t the summary_judgment stage of a proceeding it is improper for a district_court to make credibility determinations'
teleflex 119 fed.appx.at 290
the supreme_court disagreed in considering summary_judgment on that question the district_court can and should take into account expert_testimony which may resolve or keep open certain questions of fact
that is not the end of the issue however
the ultimate judgment of obviousness is a legal_determination.. where as here the content of the prior_art the scope of the patent claim and the level of ordinary_skill in the art are not in material_dispute and the obviousness of the claim is apparent in light of these factors summary_judgment is appropriate
nothing in the declarations proffered by teleflex prevented the district court from reaching the careful conclusions underlying its order for summary_judgment in this case
ksr 550 u.s. at 427 127_s.ct._1727 emphasis added

ksr and our later_cases establish that the legal_determination of obviousness may include recourse to logic judgment and common_sense in lieu of expert_testimony
see e.g. perfect_web 587 f.3d at 1329 ; ball_aerosol 555 f.3d at 993
in perfect_web the patented_technology involved a method of managing bulk e-mail comprising *1240 essentially the steps of targeting a group of recipients sending e-mail to those recipients calculating the number of successfully delivered e-mails and repeating the first three steps until reaching the desired quantity
it was undisputed that the first three steps were disclosed in the prior_art
with respect to the last step the district_court explained` if 100 email deliveries were ordered and the first transmission delivered only 95 common_sense dictates that one should try again
one could do little else'
perfect_web 587 f.3d at 1330
we affirmed the district_courts obviousness_determination and endorsed its` common_sense' reasoning
id
we furthermore concluded that no expert opinion was required to support the obviousness_determination because the technology was` easily understandable'
id.at 1329-30 quoting centricut llc v. esab group inc. 390_f.3d_1361 1369 fed.cir.2004 ; see also sundance 550 f.3d at 1365.5

thus in appropriate cases the ultimate inference as to the existence of a motivation to combine references may boil down to a question of` common_sense' appropriate for resolution on summary_judgment or jmol
see perfect_web 587 f.3d at 1330
other recent cases have confirmed the appropriateness of this approach
in ball_aerosol the sole disagreement between the parties and the basis for the district_courts denial of the accused infringers motion for summary_judgment of obviousness was whether a motivation to combine the prior_art_references existed
555 f.3d at 991
we held that where all of the limitations of the patent were present in the prior_art_references and the invention was addressed to a` known problem'` ksr.. compels the grant of summary_judgment of obviousness'
id.at 993
similarly in sundance we reversed a denial of jmol on the issue of obviousness noting that the factual inquiries underlying the determination of obviousness were not in material_dispute and concluding that the patent which combined two prior_art_references was obvious as a matter of law
550 f.3d at 1365

with these principles in mind we consider whether the evidence established the existence of a motivation to combine references as to the sleeve_patents
the above-referenced down_patent discloses a trailer towing attachment adaptable to` a motor_vehicle such as an automobile for towing by fitting a rear towing attachment for releasably attaching the tow-bar of a trailer such as a boat_trailer horse_box caravan or other_vehicle'
down_patent_col.1 ll.9-12

down patent figure 1
*1241. ?
the invention is embodied by a. support plate.. with two parallel flat lugs [ 2 3 ] which when the plate is mounted on a towing vehicle project rearwardly from the plate and are spaced apart one above the other in respective horizontal planes the upper lug being provided on its upper surface with an upstanding spherical boss [ 5 ] upon which a socket of a tow-bar can be seated a bore extending through the centre of the boss and through the two lugs and a pin engage-able in the bore [ 11 ]
id
col.1 ll.45-54
the towing attachment accepts either a tow-bar eye or tow-ball arrangement
in the tow-bar eye arrangement the pin passes between the two lugs and through the towing eye and then is` locked in position'
id
col.1 l.20
the patent describes that` [ a ] locking element [ 9 ] may be provided for engagement in a transverse hole in the lower end of the pin..
the locking element may be of any convenient known type preferably with a spring retaining means'
id
col.2 ll.3-8
the patent also discloses a` steel sleeve' as an` optional feature [ that ] fits over the portion of the pin which spans the space between the two lugs'
id
col.3 ll.15-17
the external diameter of the sleeve is such that the towing eye can be secured between the lugs with the sleeve interposed between the pin and the eye
the existence of different_aperture_sizes in standard_hitch_receivers was a known problem as the sleeve patent acknowledge industry standards require hitch_receivers to use pins of different sizes for different applications thus resulting in inconvenience and added expense
see ¡¬115_patent col.2 ll.28-32` [ a ] number of different locking devices having different sized shanks are needed to meet varied particular applications
this is cumbersome and expensive
therefore there is a need for a locking mechanism using a linear_shank that is convertible for various applications
`` ; ¡¬426_patent col.2 ll.37-41
moreover as philip wyers himself acknowledged it was also a known problem that among mass retailers such as walmart space is at a premium
j.a
4295
the down_patent clearly teaches that sleeves of different external diameter` may be provided for the attachment of trailer towing eyes of different internal diameter'
down_patent col.3 ll.20-23
when the sleeve is used the pin accommodates larger diameter towing eyes ; without the sleeve the pin fits smaller ones
it is simply a matter of common_sense that the sleeve used in down in a towing attachment quite similar to a hitch_receiver/tow bar arrangement could be combined with a barbell-shaped_hitch_pin_lock in order to address the known problem of different_aperture_sizes in standard_hitch_receivers and the shelf-space problem experienced by retailers
see *1242 ksr 550 u.s. at 421 127_s.ct._1727` when there is a design need or market pressure to solve a problem and there are a finite number of identified predictable solutions a person of ordinary_skill has good reason to pursue the known options within his or her technical grasp
if this leads to the anticipated success it is likely the product not of innovation but of ordinary_skill and common_sense
`` ; ball_aerosol 555 f.3d at 993
likewise it is clear that a skilled_artisan would have perceived a reasonable_expectation of success as a result of combining these two elements of the prior_art_references
see in re o'farrell 853_f.2d_894 904 fed.cir.1988` for obviousness under ¡± 103 all that is required is a reasonable_expectation of success
``

none of wyers arguments to the contrary is convincing
first wyers argues that master_lock did not consider down to be invalidating prior_art in its own_patent_application for its convertible_sleeve
wyers filed the ¡¬115_patent_application in april of 2000
master_lock independently filed a patent_application in february of 2001 that issued as u.s._patent_no._6862,905 the` ¡¬905_patent` claiming a pin lock with a cylindrical locking mechanism that includes a locking disc ; the patent also claimed a` sleeve dimensioned to slide over.. a portion of said first locking member'
¡¬905_patent col.6 ll.49-50
however master_locks ¡¬905_patent_application while claiming a convertible_sleeve see id
col.6 ll.50-52 did not claim that the sleeve represented a novel aspect of the invention
moreover master_locks patent_application should be treated no differently than a patent_application by a third_party
obviousness protects the public at large not a particular infringer and one is not estopped from asserting the invalidity of a patent by the fact that one has previously made an attempt to procure a patent for substantially the same invention
as the supreme_court concluded in haughey v. lee 151_u.s._282 14_s.ct._331 332-33 38_l.ed._162_(1894)` the defense of want of patentable invention in a patent operates not merely to exonerate the defendant but to relieve the public from an asserted monopoly and the court can not be prevented from so declaring by the fact that the defendant had ineffectually sought to secure the monopoly for himself'
see also paramount publix corp. v. am
tri-ergon corp. 294_u.s._464 477 55_s.ct._449 79_l.ed._997_(1935)` however inconsistent this early attempt to procure a patent may be with petitioners present contention of its invalidity for want of invention this court has long recognized that such inconsistency affords no basis for an estoppel nor precludes the court from relieving the alleged infringer and the public from the asserted monopoly when there is no invention`
the master_lock application thus does not defeat an assertion of obviousness
the failure of master_lock_employees to cite the down_patent as prior_art in internal idea disclosure forms when master_lock was considering filing its own_patent_application similarly does not defeat an argument of obviousness
what master_lock_employees subjectively knew or believed at the time they were considering filing the ¡¬905_patent_application is irrelevant
the relevant inquiry is what a hypothetical ordinarily skilled_artisan would have gleaned from the prior_art_references at the time that the patent_applications leading to the sleeve_patents were filed
see e.g. amazon.com inc. v. barnesandnoble.com inc. 239_f.3d_1343 1364 fed.cir.2001

second wyers argues that down could not be considered because master_lock introduced no expert_testimony directed to down
however as we noted above expert_testimony is not required when the references and the invention are easily understandable
perfect_web 587 f.3d at 1329

third wyers argues that there are differences between the sleeve_arrangement *1243 disclosed in the down_patent and the sleeve_arrangement in the patents-in-suit
in the down_patent the hitch arrangement is vertical see down_patent fig.1 whereas in the patents-in-suit it is horizontal see ¡¬ 115 patent fig.1 ; ¡¬426_patent fig.1
moreover in down the sleeve covers only the middle portion of the pin whereas in the patents-in-suit the sleeve covers the entire shank
wyers also asserts that the pin in the down_patent is not designed to fit tightly through a metal eye while in the ¡¬115 and ¡¬426 sleeve_patents it fits snugly
however we do not find these slight distinctions to be material

finally wyers suggests that an ordinary_skilled_artisan would not have had a reasonable_expectation of success with the patented_invention because of the expectation that a sleeve would weaken the strength of the pin against` shear forces' due to a welding seam in the sleeve
j.a
4078
shear forces are the scissoring actions that are exerted by the load during towing due to stopping and starting bumps in the road or other sudden impacts
the claims do arguably require that the hitch_pin be load-bearing ; the very purpose of a` locking hitch_pin_device for interconnecting a bar with a hitch_receiver' necessarily implies a limitation that the hitch_pin be capable of bearing a load
see ¡¬115_patent_col.10 ll.21-22
however the claims do not require any particular resistance to shear forces or any particular towing strength associated with the towing pin or sleeve ; the sole benefit of the sleeve described in the patent is its size_adaptability
see id
col.2 ll.20-36 ; id
col.5 ll.52-57
moreover one skilled in the art would have known from the down_patent that a size-adapting sleeve could work on a load-bearing towing pin
wyers himself conceded that down discloses a load-bearing pin with a sleeve
see appellees br
25` [ t ] he bushing and pin appear to be load-bearing..' ; j.a
4328` q
but it would be a load-bearing surface would n't it ?
a
sure`
thus one skilled in the art would have had a reasonable_expectation of success in combining the sleeve with the barbell_lock to solve the problem of size_adaptability in light of the prior_art teachings
see amgen inc. v. f. hoffman-la roche ltd. 580_f.3d_1340 1362 fed.cir.2009

we conclude that it was a matter of common_sense to combine the down_patent with the prior_art_barbell_locks in order to arrive at the invention claimed in the ¡¬115 and ¡¬426_patent s and that one of ordinary_skill in the art would have had a reasonable_expectation of success in doing so

we next address the question of whether there was motivation to combine the prior_art_barbell_locks with an external_sealing_mechanism
some of the prior_art hitch_pin_locks such as the ¡¬832_patent and the chang_patent used internal_sealing mechanisms
the chang_patent claims an internal_seal consisting of a sealing_ring placed in a groove on the shank of the lock
chang_patent col.4 ll.54-57
wyers ¡¬832_patent claims an` o-ring' seal located on a groove on the latch that serves to prevent the ingress of unwanted substances into the locking head essentially moving the sealing_ring of chang from an internal to an external position
see ¡¬832_patent col.7 ll.52-57
additionally at trial master_lock also introduced a number of padlocks having a variety of external_seal configurations
the master_lock 6121 series padlock includes an external_seal at the entry point of the shackle into the lock_head
see j.a
762
the heald_patent similarly discloses an external_flange_seal that grips the circumference of the shackle arms to form` a weatherproof seal'
heald_patent col.3 ll.62-col.4 l.3

master_lock 6121
*1244. ?
figures 8_and_9 of the heald patent
?
the hampton_patent discloses a padlock with an external_seal covering the locking head
the flat cover lid in the hampton_patent incorporates holes with shackle receiving edges through which the padlock shackle passes to provide a seal around the shackle
hampton_patent col.4 ll.3-7
the seal is intended in part to protect the locking mechanism from the elements and the ingress of such contaminants as` dirt and ice'
id
col.1 ll.18-29
the manuel_patent also discloses a padlock with a flat_external_seal covering the locking head in which the holes are beveled and adapted to receive the shackle legs
manuel_patent_col.1_ll.33-35
hampton patent figure 1. ?
manuel patent figure 2. ?
*1245 thus at the time of the invention there were two known ways to protect a locks locking head from the ingress of contaminants-an external or an internal_seal-and both design options were common and widely used in locks in the prior_art
it is a matter of common_sense that a flat_external_seal used in the prior_art_padlocks could be combined with a barbell-shaped_hitch_pin_lock
indeed the district_court described the difference between the invention of the ¡¬649_patent and the prior_art as` slight indeed'
myers v. master_lock_co. no._06- cv-00619 2008_wl_2168977 at *12 d.colo
may_22,_2008
wyers himself admitted that an external_flange_seal would work the same way on a padlock as it does on a barbell-shaped lock and that the purpose of the seals was the same in the prior_art_padlocks as in the patented_device
we conclude that the invention of the ¡¬649_patent represents no more than` the predictable_use of prior_art_elements according to their established functions' ksr 550 u.s. at 417 127_s.ct._1727 and as such the claims of the ¡¬649_patent are obvious as a matter of law

wyers argues that one of ordinary_skill in the art would not have had a reasonable_expectation of success in using an external_flange_seal on a barbell_lock because a` turtleneck' seal such as the one appearing in the master_lock 6121 would` limit the shackle usage as it encroaches up the shackle' and would subject the seal to` deformation possible damage'
j.a
4192
however even if this is in fact the case flat_external_seals that do not extend up the shank of the shackle also existed in the prior_art
both the manual patent and the hampton_patent disclose a flat external_flange_seal covering the locking head
see manuel_patent_col.1_ll.33-35 ; hampton_patent col.4 ll.3-7

wyers again argues that master_locks own_patent_application on a similar external_seal filed in july of 2003` admitted' that the external_seal was` novel nonobvious and useful and therefore warranted patent protection'
appellees br
31
master_lock filed a patent_application in july of 2003 for a barbell-shaped coupler_lock which included an external_seal in the form of a protective covering with an opening that resulted in an` interference fit between the seal and the shaft'
j.a
11465.6 furthermore wyers argues master_locks patent_application fails to list any of the prior_art that master_lock now claims is invalidating
appellees br
32
however the fact that master_lock claimed that its external_seal was novel bears no evidentiary significance ; master_locks patent_application should be treated no differently than a patent_application by a third_party as discussed above

thus we conclude that it was a matter of common_sense to combine the prior_art_barbell_locks with an external_sealing_mechanism in order to arrive at the claimed invention of the ¡¬649_patent and that one of ordinary_skill in the art would have had a reasonable_expectation of success in doing so

iii secondary considerations
at trial wyers presented evidence of secondary indicia of nonobviousness including commercial_success copying and unexpected results
wyers argued that commercial_success was established by master_locks success in marketing and selling its infringing product the inventions success among retailers such as walmart who sought to save shelf-space and master_locks failure to find a non-infringing substitute
wyers also argues that competitors copying and marketing of *1246 convertible shank hitch_pin_locks shortly after the inventions existence became known supports a finding of nonobviousness

we reject wyers contention that secondary_considerations of obviousness are sufficient to support the jury_verdict of nonobviousness
our case_law clearly establishes that the patentee must establish a nexus between the evidence of commercial_success and the patented_invention
see in re huang 100_f.3d_135 140 fed.cir.1996 holding that the proponent must offer proof` that the sales were a direct result of the unique characteristics of the claimed invention` emphasis added ; in re gpac inc. 57_f.3d_1573 1580 fed.cir.1995` for objective [ evidence of secondary_considerations ] to be accorded substantial weight its proponent must establish a nexus between the evidence and the merits of the claimed invention'
( emphasis added
here wyers essentially concedes that he is unable to prove a nexus to the seal_patent and provides no independent evidence for the commercial_success of the seal_patent
even with respect to the sleeve_patents wyers relies solely on master_locks $ 20 million in sales of the accused product and established no direct nexus to the sleeve feature

additionally wyers failed to establish copying
not every competing product that arguably falls within the scope of a patent is evidence of copying ; otherwise` every infringement suit would automatically confirm the nonobviousness of the patent'
iron grip barbell_co. v. usa sports inc. 392_f.3d_1317 1325 fed.cir.2004
our case_law holds that copying requires evidence of efforts to replicate a specific product which may be demonstrated through internal company documents direct evidence such as disassembling a patented prototype photographing its features and using the photograph as a blueprint to build a replica or access to the patented_product combined with substantial similarity to the patented_product
iron grip 392 f.3d at 1325 ; see akamai techs. inc. v. cable & wireless internet servs. inc. 344_f.3d_1186 1196-97 fed.cir.2003 ; advanced display sys. inc. v. kent state univ. 212_f.3d_1272 1285-86 fed.cir.2000
wyers introduced no such evidence here

moreover secondary_considerations of nonobviousness-considered here by the district_court-simply can not overcome a strong prima facie case of obviousness
see asyst techs. inc. v. emtrak inc. 544_f.3d_1310 1316 fed.cir.2008 ; agrizap inc. v. woodstream_corp. 520_f.3d_1337 1344 fed.cir.2008 ; leapfrog enters. inc. v. fisher-price inc. 485_f.3d_1157 1162 fed.cir.2007 holding that the objective considerations of nonobvious-ness presented including substantial_evidence of commercial_success praise and long-felt need were inadequate to overcome a strong showing of primary considerations that rendered the claims at issue invalid ; dystar textilfarben gmbh & co. deutschland kg v. c.h
patrick co. 464_f.3d_1356 1371 fed.cir.2006` the presence of certain secondary_considerations of nonobviousness are insufficient as a matter of law to overcome our conclusion that the evidence only supports a legal_conclusion that claim 1 would have been obvious`
here where the inventions represented no more than` the predictable_use of prior_art_elements according to their established functions' ksr 550 u.s. at 417 127_s.ct._1727 the secondary_considerations are inadequate to establish nonobviousness as a matter of law

thus we conclude that the asserted claims of the ¡¬115 ¡¬426 and ¡¬649_patent would have been obvious as a matter of law
we reverse the district_courts holding that the asserted claims of the ¡¬115 ¡¬426 and ¡¬649_patent s were nonobvious
*1247 in light of our disposition we do not reach issues concerning the calculation of damages

linn circuit_judge concurring
while i concur both in the conclusion reached and the reasoning expressed in judge dyks opinion for the court i write to address concerns raised following the supreme_courts decision in ksr_international_co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007) with respect to general_verdicts relating to obviousness

it is well established that whether an invention would have been obvious at the time the invention was made is a mixed_question of law and fact
see e.g. takeda chem indus. ltd. v. alphapharm pty. ltd. 492_f.3d_1350 1355 fed.cir.2007
the ultimate determination of obviousness is a question of law which we review de novo
id
this determination is based on the underlying factual determinations set forth in graham v. john_deere_co. 383_u.s._1 17 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966) which we review for clear error
id

in ksr the supreme_court confirmed that` [ t ] he ultimate judgment of obviousness is a legal_determination'
550 u.s. at 427 127_s.ct._1727
this acknowledgement did not change longstanding precedent permitting the submission of obviousness questions to a jury for a general_verdict provided the jury has received proper instruction on the law
as stated by this court in connell v. sears roebuck & co. [ i ] t is not error to submit the question of obviousness to the jury
no warrant appears for distinguishing the submission of legal_questions to a jury in patent cases from such submissions routinely made in other_types of cases
so long as the seventh amendment stands the right to a jury trial should not be rationed nor should particular issues in particular types of cases be treated differently from similar issues in other_types of cases
scholarly disputes over use of jury trials in technically complex cases relate to the right to trial by jury itself and center on whether lay juries are capable of making correct fact determinations not over the propriety of submitting legal_questions to juries
the obviousness issue may be in some cases complex and complicated on both fact and law but no more so than equally complicated even technological issues in product liability medical injury antitrust and similar cases
indeed though the analogy like most is not perfect the role of the jury in determining obviousness is not unlike its role in reaching a legal_conclusion respecting negligence putting itself in the shoes of one` skilled in the art' at the time the invention was made in the former and in the shoes of a` reasonable person' at the time of the events giving rise to the suit in the latter
722_f.2d_1542 1547 fed.cir.1983 ; see also harbor tug & barge co. v. papai 520_u.s._548 554 117_s.ct._1535 137_l.ed.2d_800_(1997) stating that where an` inquiry is a mixed_question of law and fact.. it often will be inappropriate to take the question from the jury' internal_citations omitted ; united states v. gaudin 515_u.s._506 511-16 115_s.ct._2310 132_l.ed.2d_444_(1995) stating that the determination of whether a statement is` material' is ultimately a legal question based on several underlying questions of` purely historical fact' which` has typically been resolved by juries' and` [ j ] uries at the time of the framing could not be forced to produce merefactual_findings but were entitled to deliver a general_verdict *1248 pronouncing the defendants guilt or innocence' ; mcdermott int l inc. v. wilander 498_u.s._337 356 111_s.ct._807 112_l.ed.2d_866_(1991) holding that the mixed law and fact_question of who is a` seaman' under the jones act is a question for the jury which` finds the facts and.. applies the legal standard' ; white v. jeffrey mining mach co. 723_f.2d_1553 1558 fed.cir.1983` jeffrey argues that the judge improperly submitted this question of law to the jury and adopted its conclusion as his own without the benefit of underlying findings of fact
the argument is without merit
submission of such a question of law to a jury accompanied by appropriate instructions is proper'
( citing connell 722 f.2d at 1542

while` the judge must remain the ultimate arbiter on the question of obviousness' this role is properly exercised on` giving proper instructions on the law to the jury before it considers its verdict' and again` when presented with a motion for jnov or new trial'
r.r
dynamics inc. v. a. stucki co. 727_f.2d_1506 1515 fed.cir.1984
to facilitate review and reveal more clearly the jurys underlying factual_findings this court has encouraged trial court judges to provide juries with special_interrogatories on obviousness
agrizap inc. v. woodstream_corp. 520_f.3d_1337 1343_n._3_(fed.cir.2008) ; richardson-vicks inc. v. upjohn co. 122_f.3d_1476 1484-85 fed.cir.1997 ; perkin-elmer corp. v. computervision corp. 732_f.2d_888 893 fed.cir.1984
however we set forth no hard and fast rule and` it must be left to the sound discretion of the trial court what form of verdict to request of a jury'
structural rubber prods co. v. park rubber co. 749_f.2d_707_(fed.cir.1984)

absent any special_interrogatories we must presume the` existence of findings necessary to support the verdict the jury reached'
perkin-elmer 732 f.2d at 893
our review of a general_verdict on obviousness thus entails two steps
`` we first presume that the jury resolved the underlying factual disputes in favor of the verdict winner and leave those presumed findings undisturbed if they are supported by substantial_evidence
then we examine the legal_conclusion de novo to see whether it is correct in light of the presumed jury fact findings'
jurgens v. mckasy 927_f.2d_1552 1557 fed.cir.1991 internal_citations omitted ; see also boston scientific scimed inc. v. cordis corp. 554_f.3d_982_(fed.cir.2009) ; agrizap 520_f.3d_1337 ; pharmastem_therapeutics inc. v. viacell inc. 491_f.3d_1342 fed.cir.2007

because there is no way to determine from a general_verdict on obviousness the specific findings of fact made by a jury on the factual questions underlying its verdict the court in examining the first part of the obviousness question is left to infer whether substantial_evidence existed from which the jury could have made the factual_findings necessary to support the verdict
here the majority examined the record and after considering the factual inferences concluded that support was lacking and that the claims at issue would have been obvious as a matter of law
with both the analysis and the conclusion i fully agree
