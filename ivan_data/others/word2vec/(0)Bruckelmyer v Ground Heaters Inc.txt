mark_bruckelmyer appeals from the decision of the united_states_district_court for the district of minnesota granting summary_judgment of invalidity of u.s
patents 5,567 085_and_5820,301 the` patents in suit' in favor of ground_heaters inc. and t.h.e
machine_company collectively` ground_heaters'
bruckelmyer v. ground_heaters inc. no._02-_cv-1761 2005_wl_1155938 d.minn
may_13,_2005` final_decision`
prior to the district_courts entry of judgment bruckelmyer stipulated that if the canadian_patent_application that issued as canadian_patent 1,158,119` the119 application' were a` printed publication' under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b it would render the patents in suit invalid on the ground of obviousness
id. slip op.at 6
because the court correctly determined that the119 application including figures 3_and_4 contained therein was a` printed publication' we affirm its judgment of invalidity

background
on july_20,_1995 a patent_application that issued as the085_patent was filed in the u.s. patent and trademark office naming mark_bruckelmyer as the inventor
on july_17,_1996 a continuation-in-part application that issued as the *1376301_patent was filed also naming bruckelmyer as the inventor
both patents disclose a method of thawing_frozen_ground so that a layer of concrete can be laid on top of the ground
'085_patent col._1,_ll._34-51 ;301_patent col._1,_ll._34-51
according to the patents in cold weather the laying of concrete is difficult because it may harden in a non-uniform manner and concrete laid on frozen_ground may later crack due to settling of the ground that thaws in warmer weather
'085_patent col._1,_ll._10-26 ;301_patent col._1,_ll._10-26
in general the patented methods place rubber hoses on the ground either around a narrow concrete footing form or within a large concrete form
'085_patent col._2,_l._25- col._3,_l._58 ;301_patent col._2,_l._25- col._4,_l._15
a liquid that is heated such as water or antifreeze is then circulated through the hoses which thaws the frozen_ground and prevents the concrete from hardening too quickly
id

on may_7,_1982 over thirteen years before bruckelmyer filed the applications that issued as the085 and301_patent s norman young filed an application that issued as canadian_patent 1,158,119
the119_patent subsequently issued on december 6 1983
the119_patent discloses a portable heating_system that places flexible_hoses` in close proximity to objects of various shapes and configurations which would otherwise be difficult to heat'
'119_patent abstract
like the patents in suit the119_patent discloses a method of heating structures by having preheated liquid flow through flexible_hoses
also similar to the patents in suit the119_patent states that the` primary object of this invention is to provide an improved method of applying heat to fresh concrete which has been placed in pre-constructed formwork during extreme cold weather'
id
to illustrate an application of the invention the119_patent provides drawings of the claimed heating_system being used to heat a beam
the patent further notes that the` system is suitable for applying heat to other subjects and is not necessarily confined to use in relation to concrete_placement
other_typical_uses are.. thawing_frozen_ground'
id. at p. 2
relevant to this appeal the119_patent omits certain drawings that were contained in the application as filed viz. two drawings illustrating the use of the disclosed heating_system to thaw_frozen_ground` figures 3_and_4`
figures 3_and_4 are not in the issued patent because they were cancelled during prosecution
nonetheless they still remain in the119_patents file_wrapper

moving forward to july_15,_2002 bruckelmyer filed a complaint against ground_heaters one of his former licensees for infringement of the patents in suit
in its responsive pleading ground_heaters filed a counterclaim asserting that the patents in suit were invalid.1 on december 19 2002 ground_heaters filed a motion for summary_judgment of invalidity based on inter alia figures 3_and_4 of the119 application
the court denied ground_heaters motion for summary_judgment of invalidity upon finding a genuine_issue of material_fact regarding whether a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have been enabled by figures 3_and_4 to practice the technology claimed by the patents in suit without undue experimentation
bruckelmyer v. ground_heaters inc. no._02-_cv-1761 slip op.at 8 2003_wl_21402870_(d._minn._june_16,_2003)` initial decision`

in reaching its decision to deny summary_judgment the court determined that the119 application was a` printed publication' *1377 under ¡± 102 b
id
the court noted that the119_patent and its application were available for public inspection at the canadian_patent_office in hull quebec more than one year before the priority date of the patents in suit
id
the court also determined albeit in a conclusory manner that` the contents of the file_wrapper [ were ] sufficiently accessible to the relevant and interested public as to constitute a printed publication for purposes of ¡± 102 b'
id

in view of the courts determination that figures 3_and_4 of the119 application constituted ¡± 102 b prior art bruckelmyer filed a stipulation in the court conceding that those figures rendered the claims of the patents in suit invalid
final_decision slip op.at 6
in doing so bruckelmyer removed from dispute any question of fact as to whether those figures were enabling to a person of ordinary_skill in the pertinent_art
ground_heaters filed a renewed motion for summary_judgment of invalidity which the court granted on may_13,_2005
id
bruckelmyer timely appealed and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 12

discussion
we review a district_courts grant of summary_judgment de novo reapplying the same standard used by the district_court
ethicon endo-surgery inc. v. u.s. surgical corp. 149_f.3d_1309 1315 fed.cir.1998
summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine_issue as to any material_fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law
fed.r.civ.p
56 c
`` whether an anticipatory document qualifies as aprinted publication under ¡± 102 is a legal conclusion based on underlying factual determinations'
cooper cameron corp. v. kvaerner oilfield prods. 291_f.3d_1317 1321 fed.cir.2002
where there is no disputed issue of material_fact however the question whether a particular reference is a` printed publication' is one of law which we review de novo
in re cronyn 890_f.2d_1158 1159 fed.cir.1989

the single legal issue in this appeal is whether figures 3_and_4 of the119 application were` printed publications' under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b
bruckelmyer argues that the district_court erred in concluding that they were
for a reference to be a` printed publication' bruckelmyer asserts it must be` publicly accessible' as that term has been used in our prior decisions
bruckelmyer contends that a patent_application located in a foreign patent_office e.g. the119 application is not` publicly accessible' just because it is laid open for inspection by the general public during the relevant_prior_art_time_frame
relying on our decisions in in re klopfenstein 380_f.3d_1345 1350 fed.cir.2004 and in re cronyn 890 f.2d at 1161 bruckelmyer asserts that for a prior_art_reference to be considered` publicly accessible' it must either 1 be published to those interested in the art for a sufficient amount of time to allow them to` captur [ e ] process [ ] and retain [ ] the information conveyed by the reference or 2 those interested must be able to locate the material in a meaningful_way'

bruckelmyer asserts that the119 application did not meet either criterion and thus it was not` publicly accessible'
according to bruckelmyer there was no evidence in the record indicating that the contents of the file_wrapper were disseminated as the119 file_wrapper was only *1378 located in the canadian_patent_office in hull quebec and there were no copies known to have been made and sent elsewhere during the prior art period
moreover bruckelmyer contends that a person of ordinary_skill in the art interested in the subject_matter of the patents in suit viz. a method for thawing_frozen_ground by using flexible_hoses and heated liquid would not have been able to locate figures 3_and_4 because the canadian_patent_office did not index or catalogue the119 application
nor was there a printed abstract of the119 application that was classified and published to allow one skilled in the art to locate figures 3_and_4 according to bruckelmyer
finally bruckelmyer argues that the119_patent itself would not have guided a person of ordinary_skill in the art to locate figures 3_and_4 because the figures were` removed' from the application during prosecution

ground_heaters responds by arguing that although the119 application was not formally indexed a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have been able to locate the figures contained in the119 application through the published119_patent
according to ground_heaters the following statement contained in the119_patent would have led one skilled in the art to the119 application and hence to figures 3_and_4` [ the claimed system ] is suitable for applying heat to other objects and is not necessarily confined to use in relation to concrete_placement
other_typical_uses are.. thawing_frozen_ground'
moreover ground_heaters notes that the119_patent was indexed and catalogued according to its subject_matter and the application was in the file of the patent in the patent_office ; ipso facto the application was also as a practical matter indexed and catalogued

we agree with the district_court that the119 application and the figures 3_and_4 associated with it was` publicly accessible' and thus that it was a` printed publication' under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b
the` printed publication' provision of ¡± 102 b` was designed to prevent withdrawal by an inventor.. of that which was already in the possession of the public'
in re wyer 655_f.2d_221 226 ccpa 1981
whether a given reference is a` printed publication' depends on whether it was` publicly accessible' during the prior period
id
a given reference is` publicly accessible' upon a satisfactory showing that such document has been disseminated or otherwise made available to the extent that persons interested and ordinarily skilled in the subject_matter or art exercising reasonable_diligence can locate it and recognize and comprehend therefrom the essentials of the claimed invention without need of further research or experimentation
id
( quoting i.c.e
corp. v. armco steel corp. 250_f.supp._738 743 s.d.n.y.1966
although ground_heaters does not assert that the119 application with figures 3_and_4 was actually disseminated during the relevant_prior_art_time_frame bruckelmyer has conceded that figures 3_and_4 of the application were in the patent file and were enabling
thus the only question that remains for us to answer is whether a person of ordinary_skill in the art interested in the subject_matter of the patents in suit and exercising reasonable_diligence would have been able to locate the119 application
if the answer to that question is` yes' then the119 application including figures 3_and_4 was` publicly accessible' and the patents in suit are invalid

controlling in our determination whether the119 application was` publicly accessible' is our predecessor_courts decision in in re wyer
in that case an australian patent_application was laid open for public *1379 inspection and an abstract of the application was published by the australian patent office more than two years before the filing date of the corresponding u.s. patent_application at issue in that case
id.at 222
the existence of a published abstract that would have allowed one skilled in the art exercising reasonable_diligence to locate the foreign_patent_application and the fact that the application was classified and indexed in the patent_office were central to the wyer courts conclusion that the application was` publicly accessible'
the court noted` [ g ] iven that there is no genuine_issue as to whether the application was properly classified indexed or abstracted we are convinced that the contents of the application were sufficiently accessible to the public and to persons skilled in the pertinent_art to qualify as aprinted publication
`` id.at 226

in this case the published119_patent is even more of a roadmap to the application_file than the abstract was in wyer
as ground_heaters observed the119_patent states that a possible use of the claimed invention is to thaw_frozen_ground by circulating heated liquid through flexible_hoses-the same use contemplated by the methods claimed in the patents in suit
given such a pertinent disclosure we conclude that no reasonable_trier of fact could find that a person of ordinary_skill in the art interested in the subject_matter of the patents in suit and exercising reasonable_diligence could not locate the119 application including figures 3_and_4 contained therein.3 indeed it would be inconsistent to determine that one skilled in the art could have located a foreign_patent_application based on information in a published abstract as our predecessor_court found in in re wyer but not here where there was an issued patent
after all an issued patent is presumably more informative of the content of its application_file than a mere abstract of the patent_application
moreover there is no genuine dispute that the119_patent was classified and indexed as the abstract was in wyer further providing the roadmap that would have allowed one skilled in the art to locate the119 application
because no reasonable_trier of fact could have found that the119_patent did not provide sufficient information to allow a person of ordinary_skill in the art to locate the119 application including the figures contained therein we agree with the district_court and conclude that that application was` publicly accessible' and hence an invalidating ¡± 102 b prior_art_reference

bruckelmyers reliance on in re cronyn to argue that the119 application was not` publicly accessible' is misplaced as that case is factually distinguishable
in in re cronyn we determined that the student theses at issue were not meaningfully catalogued or indexed and thus they were not` publicly accessible'
890 f.2d at 1161
the significance of whether these theses were meaningfully catalogued or indexed was whether one skilled in the art could locate them
in this case however it does not matter whether the119 application was catalogued or indexed` in a meaningful_way' because the119_patent was indexed and could serve as a` research aid'
id
and as we explained above no reasonable_trier of fact could find that the119_patent did not contain sufficient_disclosure to serve that purpose

equally unpersuasive is bruckelmyers argument that figures 3_and_4 were` removed' from the application during prosecution and thus a person of skill in the art would not have looked past the119_patent in searching for the subject_matter of the *1380 patents in suit
as a matter of undisputed fact the119_patent ee did not physically remove figures 3_and_4 from the file_wrapper but merely cancelled the subject_matter figures from the patent during prosecution
the figures were thus still in the file although they did not appear in the issued patent
the declaration from bruckelmyers canadian patent law practitioner explains that when subject_matter is cancelled during prosecution a replacement page may be put in front of the page containing the cancelled matter but the page containing the cancelled original matter still remains in the file_wrapper
moreover for the reasons that we articulated above it does not matter that figures 3_and_4 do not appear in the119_patent because no reasonable_trier of fact could find that there was not sufficient_disclosure in the patent to allow one skilled in the art to locate the figures contained in the application

conclusion
for the aforementioned reasons the district_courts decision granting summary_judgment of invalidity of the patents in suit in favor of ground_heaters is affirmed

affirmed
linn circuit_judge dissenting
i respectfully dissent from the majoritys decision to affirm the district_courts grant of summary_judgment of invalidity of the patents in suit
because the district_court erred in holding that the patent_application that issued as canadian_patent no._1158,119` the119 application' was a` printed publication' under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b i would vacate the district_courts summary_judgment of invalidity and remand for further proceedings

the majority distinguishes in re cronyn 890_f.2d_1158 fed.cir.1989 by concluding that the issued119_patent serves as an index to the119 application
ante at 1379
(` [ i ] t does not matter whether the119 application was catalogued or indexedin a meaningful_way because the [ issued ]119_patent was indexed..'
the majority elaborates that the issued119_patent is even more of a roadmap to the application_file than an abstract inferring that the issued patent can take the place of a classified and indexed abstract and relying on our precedent in in re wyer 655_f.2d_221 c.c.p.a.1981 contends that the indexed patent makes the119 application` publicly accessible'
ante at 1379

in my opinion it is not entirely sound to view the issued119_patent as a roadmap to the underlying_file_history
an abstract which is similar in many respects to a library index card is a brief statement of the contents of something else ; i.e. the more extensive text to which it refers
it is intended to serve as a tool to steer researchers to the content of a larger and more comprehensive work
the abstract contained in an issued patent for example is a summary of the technical information contained in the specification
on the other hand the printed text of an issued patent-including the abstract written description and claims-is not necessarily looked to as a summary or index of the underlying_file_history
while it is commonplace for parties to examine patent file histories for guidance on matters of claim interpretation surrender estoppel disclaimer or disavowal researchers normally expect the text of printed patents to correspond to and be coextensive with the applications from which they have been issued
in that sense the text of an issued patent does not generally serve to guide researchers to the file_history for a more expansive disclosure of the described invention and it certainly does not lead researchers to the file_history for disclosure of subject_matter not described in the issued text

*1381 moreover even if an issued patent may be considered a form of index to the underlying_file_history there is nothing in the text of the issued119_patent to suggest that a disclosure of structure for implementing the` thawing_frozen_ground' use will be found in the underlying119 application
the fact that an additional drawing disclosing additional structure is present in the application_file is a matter of sheer happenstance nowhere indicated in the issued patent
for this reason it is my view that as in cronyn the anticipatory drawings at issue in this case are` not accessible to the public because they have not been cataloged or indexed in a meaningful_way'
see cronyn 890 f.2d at 1161

public accessibility has been the touchstone by which a prior_art_reference satisfies the purposes of 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b
see in re wyer 655 f.2d at 226 stating that the entire purpose of the` printed publication' bar was to` prevent withdrawal' of disclosures` already in the possession of the public' by the issuance of a patent
in klopfenstein this court discussed that the requirement of public accessibility can be satisfied under a variety of conditions including when there has been a meaningful distribution indexing or display of the material to the public interested in the art
see generally in re klopfenstein 380_f.3d_1345 fed.cir.2004
in klopfenstein we held that a reference was made sufficiently publicly accessible because despite that it was not indexed and copies were not distributed to the public it was prominently displayed for several days to a wide variety of interested viewers who were free to take notes or photographs and copying would have been a simple undertaking
id.at 1350
in this case in addition to not being meaningfully indexed as discussed above no copies were known to have been made or distributed during the critical period and the119 application was available for viewing only at the canadian_patent_office in hull quebec

for the foregoing reasons it is my view that the limited reference in the issued119_patent to` thawing_frozen_ground' did not put the public in possession of the canceled drawings in the119 application
because the district_court erroneously determined that the119 application including the canceled drawings was a` printed publication' i would vacate the district_courts grant of summary_judgment and remand

it is unclear from the record whether ground_heaters claimed that its products did not infringe the patents in suit
the answer to that question however is not necessary for us to decide this appeal

ground_heaters inc. and t.h.e
machine_company were both appellees when this appeal was originally filed
since then bruckelmyer and ground_heaters have settled and ground_heaters is no longer part of this appeal
the appeal between bruckelmyer and t.h.e

we do not express an opinion regarding the unusual situation where the prior_art_reference at issue is contained in a foreign file_wrapper but otherwise bears little relation to the subject_matter of the issued and published patent
