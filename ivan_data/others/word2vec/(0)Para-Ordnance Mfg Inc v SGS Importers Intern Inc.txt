para-ordnance manufacturing inc. para-ordnance appeals the june_2,_1994 decision and the june_9,_1994 order of the united_states_district_court for the eastern_district of virginia
para-ordnance mfg. inc. v. sgs importers int l inc. docket no._94-117- a
following a bench_trial in para-ordnances patent infringement suit against sgs importers international inc. sgs the district_court determined that all of the claims of united_states patent no._4862,618 the618_patent 1 are obvious over the prior_art and are therefore invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 1988 and 2 were not infringed by sgs
we affirm the courts determination of invalidity and do not address infringement

background
the618_patent discloses and claims a` conversion_kit' for expanding the ammunition_capacity of semi-automatic handguns
an expansion in ammunition_capacity is accomplished for any particular handgun by providing a widened ammunition magazine to accommodate an increased number of cartridges arranged in a staggered side-by-side_configuration
the kit of the618_patent has a one-piece handgun_frame with a grip_portion *1087 that is wide enough to hold an enlarged magazine

the618_patent contains thirteen claims with one independent claim and twelve dependent claims
claim 1 reads as follows:1

1
a conversion_kit to convert a semi-automatic hand-gun of a predetermined round capacity to a hand-gun of a higher round capacity comprising a frame made in one piece including an elongated top_part having a constant width throughout its length and flat parallel external_side_faces each with an open-ended groove defining guides for the conventional slide of said hand-gun and a grip downwardly depending at an angle from an intermediate portion of said top_part and having a bottom_end said grip having a width greater than the width of said top_part with external_side_faces merging with the external_side_faces of said top_part below said grooves said frame having a through-bore defining a magazine_chamber extending through said grip and through said top art and forming a bottom opening through said bottom_end and a top opening through said top_part said through-bore having opposite side_faces substantially parallel to the long axis of said top_part and defining lower side_face_portions which are straight and parallel to each other starting from said bottom_end to a zone just below said top_part followed by intermediate_face_portions which are converging and in turn followed by upper face portions which are substantially parallel to each other said grooves being uninterrupted from end to end and adapted to slidably retain said slide for reciprocating movement of the latter
para-ordnance the exclusive licensee of the618_patent with the exclusive right to sue for infringement,2 brought suit against sgs alleging that sgss llama_ix-c and ix-d handguns infringed the claims of the618_patent
in addition to denying infringement sgs countered that the claims of the patent were invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103
sgs asserted that the claims were obvious from the following items the colt 191145 caliber_handgun the browning_hi-power 9mm handgun and the llama_omni45 caliber_handgun
of this prior_art the colt 1911 a frame and magazine similar to the browning_hi-power and a magazine similar to the llama_omni magazine were before the patent and trademark office during prosecution of the618_patent
the complete llama_omni handgun was not

at the conclusion of the trial the district_court concluded that claim 1 would have been obvious to one of ordinary_skill in the art and thus is invalid
the district_court based its conclusion of obviousness on the prior_art and the testimony of sgss expert david_findlay
in determining obviousness the court found that claim 1 differs from the prior_art primarily in the means used to implement the mechanical_transition between the handgun_frames widened grip_portion and its narrower_top_portion
these means are found in the claim limitation which refers to` intermediate_face_portions which are converging'

discussion
under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103` [ a ] patent may not be obtained.. if the differences between the subject_matter sought to be patented and the prior_art are such that the subject_matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary_skill in the art to which said subject_matter pertains'
obviousness may not be established using hindsight or in view of the teachings or suggestions of the inventor

on appeal para-ordnance advances four contentions 1 that the district_court focused on the` heart' of the618_patent instead of the invention as a whole ; 2 that the court did not address motivation to modify the prior_art ; 3 that the court erred in its analysis of secondary_considerations of nonobviousness ; and 4 that the court used hindsight in its obviousness_analysis
we address each of these contentions in turn

a. para-ordnances first contention requires little discussion
in performing its obviousness_analysis the district_court properly viewed the claimed invention as a whole and did not improperly focus on what it perceived to be the heart of the invention
to the extent the court focused on the claimed inventions converging intermediate_faces it did no more than give appropriate attention to the feature of the invention that was central to the obviousness inquiry

b. para-ordnances main argument is that the district_court did not address how a person of ordinary_skill in the handgun design art would have been motivated to make the modifications to the prior_art necessary to arrive at the converging intermediate_face_portions of the claimed invention
we disagree

the problem addressed by the claimed` intermediate_face_portions which are converging' is making the mechanical_transition between the widened grip_portion and the narrower_top_portion of the handgun_frame of the para-ordnance_kit
as explained above the grip_portion of the frame is wider than the top_portion because the grip must accommodate a widened magazine
thus the question is whether in light of the prior_art it would have been obvious to one of ordinary_skill in the art to use a one-piece_frame with converging areas at the top of the grip that is claimed in the618_patent
put another way would one of ordinary_skill in the art who set out to solve the problem of increasing ammunition_capacity and who had before him in his workshop the prior_art have been reasonably expected to use the solution that is claimed in the618_patent
we have no difficulty concluding that the answer is yes

a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have had before him various prior_art handguns *1089 including the colt 1911 and the browning_hi-power neither of which teach the concept of convergence to solve the problem confronting the person of ordinary_skill in the art
instead those references merely teach the use of side_faces of a frame to guide magazines snugly into their frames
those two references as noted were before the examiner during prosecution of the618_patent
the most important prior_art available to the person of ordinary_skill in the art as he set out to solve his problem-art which was not put before the examiner-is the llama_omni
as seen in the photograph below the llama_omnis two grip_covers include angled plastic_tabs which converge in the direction of the top of the grip
these tabs function to guide the magazine into its proper position inside the grip
the llama_omnis magazine in turn is widened so that it can hold more_cartridges and it shows convergence at its top_portion
this convergence allows cartridges which are inside the magazine in a staggered side-by-side_configuration to feed into the narrowed top_portion of the magazine and then into the chamber
thus not only was convergence in the prior_art but it was there as part of the solution to the need for a handgun with an increased magazine_capacity-precisely the same need that is addressed by the para-ordnance conversion_kit

?
it is true that the plastic_tabs inside the llama_omni grip_covers are not part of the frame and that the frame itself without the grip_covers attached shows no convergence of the kind claimed in the618_patent
we return though to the person of ordinary_skill in the art in his workshop
we can presume that he would have carefully examined all the components of the llama_omni
he no doubt would have examined the guns magazine frame and grip_covers as separate_pieces
in so doing he would have seen that the problem of expanding ammunition_capacity was solved by widening the magazine so that it could hold more_cartridges in a staggered side-by-side_configuration
essentially at this point the person of ordinary_skill in the art was half way home
all he had to do now was to decide how to merge the widened grip necessarily resulting from the widened magazine with the handguns top_portion
continuing his examination of the components of the llama_omni he no doubt would have attached the grip_covers to the frame
then holding the llama_omni with its grip_covers attached but with no magazine inside and looking up into the grip from the bottom he would have seen just as we can see from examining para-ordnances trial ex
6a-1 the llama_omni convergence inside a unitary frame once the grips are attached as they must be for the handgun to be of any practical use
indeed the naked eye could not distinguish this convergence-created by the attachment of the grip_covers-from the convergence created by the single_piece_frame of the618_patent except to recognize of course that the converging areas in the frame of the618_patent are broader
quite simply the person of ordinary_skill in the art would have found himself looking into a converging frame just as if he were looking into the frame of the para-ordnance_kit
when he did this he would have seen the converging frame as the solution to the merging problem

*1090 the district_court based its conclusion of obviousness on` both the prior_art and the teachings of the prior_art.. [ ] and also.. general_knowledge of one skilled in the art'
as just discussed the court had before it the prior_art and what it taught
as far as the general_knowledge of one skilled in the art is concerned the court had before it the testimony of david_findlay sgss expert witness
with the prior_art before him findlay testified that the use of a one-piece_frame to provide convergence would have been obvious to one equipped with the knowledge generally available to one skilled in the art
relying upon findlays testimony the district_court determined that a person with the general experience and knowledge of one of ordinary_skill in the art of gunsmithing/gun design would have chosen the solution claimed in the618_patent as a straightforward solution

based upon the foregoing with particular emphasis on what the llama_omni reference teaches we are unable to say that the district_courts determination of obviousness is either incorrect as a matter of law or based upon findings of fact that are clearly erroneous
moreover the district_courts failure to set forth an explicit explanation as to how a person of ordinary_skill in the pertinent_art would have combined the prior_art described by the court in order to arrive at the claimed invention does not require reversal
see cable elec prods. inc. v. genmark inc. 770_f.2d_1015 1025 226_uspq_881 886-87 fed.cir.1985 upholding district_courts finding of obviousness even though the district_court did not explain how prior_art teachings could be combined to produce patented_invention

the dissent makes two points
the first is that there was no` motivation or teaching for a person of ordinary_skill in the art to use a frame made in a single_piece with converging side_face_portions'
as we have demonstrated the motivation leaps at a person of ordinary_skill in the art from thorough inspection of the assembled llama_omni inside the frame of which he observes converging side_faces which snugly accommodate the prior_art magazine
from the decision of the district_court we can and do accept the implicit fact-finding that the assembled llama_omni suggests if not actually teaches the marriage of convergent side_face_portions with and into a single frame piece
while we assume that the dissent must view the assembled llama_omni differently we can not say that the evidence before the court proves its conclusion to be clearly erroneous
we do not believe this is the case however
as just discussed there plainly was such motivation and teaching in the prior_art

the dissents second point is that` the prior_art_references teach away from making the combination in the claimed invention'
in that regard the dissent takes the position that the browning_hi-power` teaches away from using convergence at all' because it supports the magazine` with a rounded_frame that does not converge'

`` a reference may be said to teach away when a person of ordinary_skill upon [ examining ] the reference would be discouraged from following the path set out in the reference or would be led in a direction divergent from the path that was taken by the applicant'
in re gurley 27_f.3d_551 553 31_uspq2d_1130 1131 fed.cir.1994
that the browning_hi-power does not have a converging frame does not require a finding that it` teaches away'
while it does not teach convergence there is nothing about the browning_hi-power to warn a person of ordinary_skill against using convergence
see in re fine 837 f.2d at 1074 5 uspq2d at 1599 citing w.l
gore & assocs. 721 f.2d at 1550 220 uspq at 311
in other words there is nothing about the browning_hi-power that teaches that convergence should not or can not be used to guide the magazine
moreover the teachings of the browning must be weighed alongside the teachings of the llama_omni which as explained above teaches the propriety of employing convergence to guide the frame
see in re young 927_f.2d_588 591 18_uspq2d_1089 1091 fed.cir.1991

c. para-ordnance also argues that the district_court erred in analyzing secondary_considerations of nonobviousness
as noted *1091 above such considerations include commercial_success long-felt but unsolved_needs failures of others and copying
see graham 383 u.s. at 17-18 148 uspq at 467 ; avia_group_int l inc. 853 f.2d at 1564 7 uspq2d at 1554
the district_court considered the evidence presented in relation to the secondary_considerations and concluded that there was no commercial_success no long-felt but unsolved need and no copying that favored a finding of nonobviousness
determining whether these considerations exist in a given case is a factual inquiry
specialty composites v. cabot corp. 845_f.2d_981 989-90 6_uspq2d_1601 1607 fed.cir.1988
this court gives great deference to the district_courts decisions regarding credibility of witnesses

given this deferential standard and the strong showing of obviousness discussed above we can not say that the district_courts conclusions regarding secondary_considerations are clearly erroneous
see ryko mfg co. v. nu-star inc. 950_f.2d_714 719 21_uspq2d_1053 1058 fed.cir.1991 the weight of secondary_considerations may be of insufficient weight to override a determination of obviousness based on primary considerations ; newell companies inc. v. kenney mfg co. 864_f.2d_757 768 9_uspq2d_1417 1426 fed.cir.1988 secondary_considerations` must be considered [ but ] they do not control the obviousness conclusion' citations omitted cert
denied 493_u.s._814 110_s.ct._62 107_l.ed.2d_30_(1989)

d. finally in asserting that the district_court used hindsight para-ordnance challenges the courts reliance on one of sgss trial exhibits exhibit 773 para-ordnance argues that exhibit 77 improperly suggested to the court that the claimed inventions converging intermediate_face was the most obvious_way to form the mechanical_transition between the inventions widened grip_portion and its narrower_top_portion

we agree with para-ordnance that exhibit 77 improperly suggested that the claimed inventions converging intermediate_face was the most obvious_way to form the mechanical_transition between the inventions widened grip_portion and its narrower_top_portion and that the exhibit therefore improperly suggested the finding of obviousness which sgs sought to obtain at trial
because exhibit 77 was improperly suggestive and therefore in the circumstances of this case may have constituted a type of hindsight_analysis we have given no weight to it or to the testimony relating to it
having carefully reviewed the record however we hold that the district_courts obviousness_analysis was proper in every other respect and that the remainder of the evidence-discussed above-supports the courts finding that the claims of the618_patent are obvious from the prior_art

conclusion
based upon the foregoing we hold that the district_courts finding of invalidity is neither incorrect as a matter of law nor based upon findings of fact that are clearly erroneous

costs
each party shall bear its own costs

affirmed
archer chief_judge dissenting
the obviousness_analysis in this case is a classic example of hindsight
the district_court clearly applied hindsight by taking two pieces of prior_art neither of which suggests a frame in a single_piece with converging sides and finds that such a frame would be obvious` even to one not [ s ] killed in the art'
the majority similarly applies hindsight by making the same conclusion based on the same prior_art
other than the invention disclosed in the patent there is no motivation or teaching to combine converging sides in a *1092 single_piece_frame ; and in view of the strong secondary_considerations nonobviousness is the proper result
i therefore dissent

the618_patent relates to an apparatus for converting the well-known45 caliber colt 1911 handgun from a 7-round capacity to a 13-round capacity magazine or clip
claim 1 the only independent claim describes a frame made in a single_piece with a through-bore defining a magazine_chamber with converging side_face_portions
the specification describes the primary function of the converging side_faces as providing a solid_connection between the frame and the slide as well as an uninterrupted guide for the insertion of a magazine

the district_court deemed the converging side_face_portions as the` heart' of the invention
as a result the court sought to determine whether prior_art existed that would render this` convergence' obvious
the court focused on two prior_art handguns the browning_hi-power and the llama_omni
the browning_hi-power has straight side_faces with no convergence of any kind
instead the handgun utilizes an open-faced_frame with a rounded front handle portion that supports the insertion of the magazine
the llama_omni also has an open-faced_frame with no convergence
however the handgun does utilize a converging strip on the grip_covers
neither of these prior_art_references therefore uses converging side_faces on the frame to provide a solid_connection or to guide the insertion of the magazine

for a combination of prior_art_references to render an invention obvious` [ t ] here must be some reason suggestion or motivation found in the prior_art whereby a person of ordinary_skill in the field of the invention would make the combination'
in re oetiker 977_f.2d_1443 1447 24_uspq2d_1443 1446 fed.cir.1992
that one must point to some reason suggestion or motivation to make a combination is not to say that the teaching must be explicit but in order to render an invention obvious by the combination of prior_art_references the record must contain some basis to rebut the presumption of validity
see e.g. vandenberg v. dairy equip co. 740_f.2d_1560 1568 224_uspq_195 198 fed.cir.1984
a finding of obviousness on any other basis would constitute hindsight
see interconnect planning corp. v. feil 774_f.2d_1132 1143 227_uspq_543 551 fed.cir.1985` when prior_art_references require selective combination by the court to render obvious a subsequent invention there must be some reason for the combination other than the hindsight gleaned from the invention itself
``

neither the district_court nor the majority points to any motivation or teaching for a person of ordinary_skill in the pertinent_art to use a frame made in a single_piece with converging side_face_portions
a simple invention may be patentable even if the invention comprises the combination of features known in the art provided the combination itself is not obvious
see in re sponnoble 405_f.2d_578 585 160_uspq_237 243 ccpa 1969` a patentable invention within the ambit of 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 may result even if the inventor has in effect merely combined features old in the art for their known purpose without producing anything beyond the results inherent in their use'
( emphasis omitted
here however the claimed invention would not even result from a combination of the cited references
as the district_court and the majority recognize neither the browning_hi-power nor the llama_omni utilizes a single frame with converging side_faces
only the llama_omni has any convergence and its converging elements are formed by the grip_covers not the frame
`` the mere fact that elements of [ an invention ] may be found in various [ references ] does not necessarily negate invention'
in re mckenna 203_f.2d_717 721 97_uspq_348 351 ccpa 1953
nevertheless the district_court and the majority find that moving the convergence from the grip_covers to the frame would have been obvious

the district_court recited two grounds for its obviousness_finding
the first was the courts observation of exhibit 77 a line drawing profiling appellants invention but omitting the convergence of the side_faces and the second was the testimony of the appellees expert mr._findlay
the district_court stated *1093 [ exhibit ] 77 is a useful way to think about it
indeed the court spent some time last night making sketches of it
almost infinite variety of configurations one could pick
and the obvious one even to one not [ s ] killed in the art would be to converge [ the frame ]
but in any event im persuaded by mr._findlays testimony in that regard
the majority recognizes that exhibit 77 was improperly suggestive and may have constituted a hindsight_analysis and thus gives no weight to the exhibit
yet the majority nonetheless concludes that the rest of the district_courts obviousness_analysis was proper
the analysis on which the majority relies however comprises nothing more than the testimony of mr._findlay who used exhibit 77 as the basis for his position on obviousness.1 thus the majority having rejected exhibit 77 should also have given no weight to the testimony of mr._findlay
if such evidence is excluded the district_courts obviousness_finding is clearly not sustainable
there is an absence of any motivation or teaching in the prior_art to combine the prior_art_references and there is no other probative evidence relating to obviousness

after essentially rejecting the district_courts obviousness_analysis based on the prior_art the majority proceeds to construct its own analysis of the prior_art to find that the invention would have been obvious
the majority suggests that motivation for the claimed invention comes from looking into the llama_omni with its grip_covers attached but with no magazine inside and that convergence would be seen
the problem with this is that the convergence is still on the plastic handles not the frame
to say as the majority does that viewing the llama_omni convergence would suggest converging the frame is in my view not the teaching suggestion or motivation necessary to overcome the presumption of validity
it is not clear and convincing_evidence of obviousness

in addition the record below supports nonobviousness because the prior_art_references teach away from making the combination in the claimed invention
for example the district_court recognized an` [ a ] lmost infinite variety of configurations one could pick' to form a handgun with sides that support a large capacity magazine
supporting this is the fact that both the browning_hi-power and the llama_omni handguns form the mechanical_transition between the widened grip_portion and the narrower_top_portion in some manner different than the converging side_face_portions used in the claimed invention
the browning_hi-power teaches away from using convergence at all achieving support for the magazine through a rounded_frame that does not converge
the llama_omni utilizes three separate_pieces to form the convergence
in addition to the two ways demonstrated by the prior_art the appellees own expert testified that there was an infinite range of possibilities to achieve the desired result
thus the evidence discloses a variety of ways to connect the frame with the slide and to guide the insertion of a magazine
in sum with no motivation or teaching to combine converging side_face_portions with a single_piece_frame and with the evidence of teaching away the record supports a conclusion of nonobviousness
any contrary conclusion would be based on hindsight

the secondary_considerations of nonobviousness serve` as insurance against the insidious attraction of the siren hindsight'

*1094 stratoflex inc. v. aeroquip corp. 713_f.2d_1530 1538 218_uspq_871 879 fed.cir.1983
the appellant points to four secondary_considerations to support nonobviousness failure of others long-felt need commercial_success and copying

the district_court rejected failure of others as an indicium of nonobviousness because it was the inventor who previously attempted but failed to develop a device to convert the colt 1911
the district_court however said nothing about the fact that the manufacturer of the colt 1911 had also attempted but failed to expand the magazine_capacity of the colt 1911
the record shows that it had not only tested extended length single stack magazines but also staggered magazines for expanded magazine_capacity but found them inadequate and never developed either alternative
such a failure of others to do that which the patent claims is strong evidence of nonobviousness

the district_court also found no persuasive_evidence of a long-felt need for expanded capacity magazines for the colt 1911
the court made this finding based primarily on the fact that in 1986 the u.s._military converted from the colt 1911 to the beretta a nine millimeter handgun with a 15-round capacity
as the district_court recognized the colt 1911 had been used by the u.s._military at least since 1911 but neither the colt manufacturer nor any other manufacturer had developed a45 caliber_handgun with an expanded capacity magazine
there was obviously a need at the time of the conversion to the beretta handgun and even the district_court recognized such a need was present from the mid- to late-1980s
a long-felt need is also persuasive_evidence of nonobviousness

although the district_court found that there had been commercial_success the court rejected this secondary consideration because of the absence of` any evidence to show that this commercial_success is related to an invention that the patentee claims to have made'
in discussing commercial_success in the obviousness_analysis the court correctly pointed out that there must be a nexus between the sales and the merits of the invention

but see ryko mfg co. v. nu-star inc. 950_f.2d_714 719 21_uspq2d_1053 1058 fed.cir.1991` [ p ] rima facie evidence of nexus is established if there was commercial_success and if the invention disclosed in the patent was that which was commercially successful`
the district_court pointed to advertising and the sponsorship of competitive shooting teams as the principal reasons for appellants commercial_success
while there were contradictory statements in the record as to the reasons for the commercial_success i am not persuaded that either of these activities overcomes the evidence that commercial_success was the result of the invention claimed in the618_patent being the first to enable an expansion of the magazine_capacity for the colt 1911
further appellees attack upon the commercial_success of the patented_invention is less credible where appellee makes or sells an exact copy of the patented_invention as discussed below
finally even if the district_court was correct in finding other reasons for commercial_success the other secondary_considerations discussed are overwhelming evidence of nonobviousness

the district_court also found evidence of copying but rejected this consideration
copying of a patented_invention is indicative of nonobviousness

the district_courts conclusion on this point is also erroneous
the appellee conceded at trial that the accused handgun reads on one or more claims of the618_patent only disclaiming infringement because of the wording of the preamble
appellees frames grip_covers and magazines are clearly exact copies except for the location of the magazine catch hole yet the magazines are compatible for either handgun
in addition to manufacturing handguns that read directly on the618_patent claims appellant alleges and the record does not indicate otherwise that appellee also converted llama models that were *1095 clones of the colt 1911 into expanded capacity handguns for the conversions the frame grip_covers and magazine of the llama_ix-a and ix-b were simply replaced to produce handguns covered by the claims of the patented_invention
appellee therefore may have utilized the very conversion_kit methodology set forth in the preamble of the claims
the evidence of copying provides persuasive support for nonobviousness

for all of the reasons stated above the conclusion is inescapable that the district_court applied hindsight and failed to give adequate weight to the secondary_considerations in reaching its obviousness determination
unfortunately the majority opinion now makes the same mistake
accordingly i dissent

the appellees expert always explained his position on obviousness in terms of exhibit 77
even though the expert also made comparisons of the browning_hi-power and the llama_omni with the patented_invention in proffering obviousness the expert only gave conclusory reasons why one skilled in the art would choose to make the combination of the prior_art_references
the appellants expert in contrast presented more than mere conclusory statements
the expert explained that one skilled in the art of handgun_manufacture would not have necessarily chosen to create a convergence in the frame based on manufacturing considerations noting that the preferred embodiment of the patented_invention utilizes investment casting whereas the art of handgun_manufacture had predominately relied upon electro-chemical machining
