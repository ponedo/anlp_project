opinion
rader circuit_judge
on december 29 1994 the united_states_district_court for the southern_district of indiana denied sofamor_danek_group inc.s sofamor motion for a preliminary_injunction against depuy-motech inc. depuy-motech
because sofamor did not meet its burdens of proof this court affirms

background
sofamor owns three patents u.s. patent nos._4641,636 4,815,453 and 5,005,562 on surgical implant devices to correct deformities or traumas in the human_spine
the patent at issue is u.s._patent_no._5005,562 the562_patent
sofamor and depuy-motech compete in the spinal implant business
depuy-motech introduced a competing product the moss-miami spinal implant device in the united states market

both the invention of the562_patent and the moss-miami_device are used in spinal surgery
this technology essentially implants rigid rods to straighten or support a deformed spine
both the patented_invention and the moss-miami_device comprise an anchoring hook implant with an open back into which the surgeon may place the rod
a threaded_plug secures the rod
in the moss-miami_device an external_nut further secures the threaded_plug

sofamor filed an action alleging that depuy-motech infringed their three spinal implant *1219 patents
sofamor then moved for a preliminary_injunction on the562_patent to stop depuy-motech from the allegedly infringing activity
depuy-motech asserted invalidity and unenforceability defenses as well as patent misuse

sofamor and depuy-motech dispute whether the moss-miami_device infringes claim 1 of the562_patent
the claim states implant for an osteosynthesis device in particular of the spine comprising anchorage portion means for anchoring the implant to bone and body attaching means for attaching the implant to a rod said body attaching means having two side_branches defining a channel open at both sides of the body attaching means in order to be able to receive the rod and open to a rear_portion of the body attaching means and a threaded_plug a female_thread formed in inner_walls of said two side_branches at the rear_portion of the body attaching means said threaded_plug being screwed into said female_thread to close the channel at said rear_portion the plug having a face directed towards the rod said facing being equipped with means for gripping and attaching the plug to the rod in a manner in which the rod will be clamped to prevent translation and rotation

14-29 emphasis added

in december 1994 the trial_court held a three-day hearing receiving testimony from several witnesses
the court denied sofamors motion for preliminary_injunction
in reaching its decision the trial_court construed the claims of the562_patent
from the specification prosecution_history and extrinsic evidence the court determined that a device fitting within the meaning of` body attaching means' would 1. use less than three parts to attach the rod to the spine ; 2. have a body attaching means connected to an anchoring device the rear_portion of which has a channel or groove open to the back ; 3. have a body attaching means that is formed by two smooth-sided_branches containing threads on their inner_walls into which a single threaded_plug is tightened to close the channel ; and
4. use a plug that is equipped with something that enables it to lock the rod against movement in three different directions

ip94-350-c 1994_wl_846541 at *6 s.d.ind
dec._29,_1994

based on this claim reading the trial_court found that sofamor did not prove the likelihood of success on patent_infringement or validity
further sofamor did not offer evidence to support a finding of irreparable_harm
without a showing on these two prongs the court did not balance hardships on the parties or assess the impact of an injunction on the public_interest
sofamor appeals to this court

discussion
the grant of a preliminary_injunction is within the trial_courts discretion
to overturn the denial of a preliminary_injunction an appellant must show both that the trial_court relied on clearly erroneous factors and abused its discretion
reebok_int l ltd. v. j. baker inc. 32_f.3d_1552 1555 31_uspq2d_1781 1783 fed.cir.1994 ; new england braiding co. v. a.w
chesterton co. 970_f.2d_878 882 23_uspq2d_1622 1625 fed.cir.1992

to be entitled to a preliminary_injunction a movant must show 1 a reasonable_likelihood of success on the merits 2 an irreparable_harm 3 the balance of hardships tipping in its favor ; and 4 a tolerable effect on the public_interest
hybritech inc. v. abbott labs. 849_f.2d_1446 1451 7_uspq2d_1191 1195 fed.cir.1988
the court must balance these factors against one another and against the extent of the relief sought
id
the movant bears the burden of proving entitlement to relief
reebok_int l 32 f.3d at 1555

central to the movants burden are the likelihood of success and irreparable_harm factors
id.at 1556
a movant must first show a reasonable_likelihood of success on the merits
under 35 u.s.c.¡± 283 this showing requires proof on both validity and infringement
hybritech 849 f.2d at 1451

*1220 to determine likelihood of success on the patent_infringement issue the court may construe disputed claim language as a matter of law
see markman v. westview instruments inc. 52_f.3d_967 978 34_uspq2d_1321 1328 fed.cir
) cert
granted 515_u.s._1192 116_s.ct._40 132_l.ed.2d_921_(1995)
the court then determines whether the accused device is likely to fall within the scope of the claims
h.h
robertson co. v. united steel deck inc. 820_f.2d_384 389 2_uspq2d_1926 1929 fed.cir.1987
to infringe an accused device must embody each claim_limitation or its equivalent
charles_greiner & co. v. mari-med mfg. inc. 962_f.2d_1031 1034 22_uspq2d_1526 1528 fed.cir.1992

likelihood of success on infringement thus depends on the meaning of disputed claim_terms supplied by the court
in ascertaining this meaning the parties dispute the meaning of two claim_terms the` body attaching means' and the` threaded_plug'
the` body attaching means' element claims in means-plus-function form a structure to attach the implanted anchor to the rod

section 112 ?
6 of title 35 sets forth the method of construing means-plus-function claims
specifically the court construes the means-plus-function language to encompass the structure material or acts described in the specification and equivalents thereof
see 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
6 1988 ; in re donaldson co. 16_f.3d_1189 1193 29_uspq2d_1845 1848 fed.cir.1994

a resort to the562 specification discloses several disadvantages of the prior_art of spine reformation technology
for example the prior_art included a` multiplicity and complexity of the elements' resulting in` awkward bulkiness'
u.s._patent_no._5005,562 col. 1 11
30-33
to overcome these disadvantages the562_patent disclosed only a threaded_plug screwed into a` female_thread formed in the inner_walls of the two side_branches' of the attaching means
this simple structure ensured that the implant has` minimum bulk'
id. col. 1 11
40-42 48-50
this structure also had the virtue of reducing the parts compared to an implant` provided with a plug and a separate_locking_screw'
id. col. 3 11
64-67
thus the specification expressly excluded from the meaning of` body attaching means' a structure with a separate_locking_screw
id
this description in the specification provides the structure to define the limits of` body attaching means' in the patent

in contrast to the562_patent the moss-miami_device has a bulky external_nut as a separate_locking_screw that fits over the threaded_plug
depuy-motech included this nut to provide stability
the specification of the562_patent defines the` body attaching means' as expressly excluding a structure with a separate_locking_screw
the moss-miami_device includes a separate_locking_screw and is thus different from the structure covered by the term` body attaching means' in the562_patent
the trial_court was well within its province to determine that sofamor did not show a reasonable_likelihood of success on infringement of the` body attaching means' limitation

in addition to examining the claim and specification the trial_court expanded the search for claim meaning to encompass prosecution_history on` body attachment means'
moreover this search caused the trial_court to improperly import limitations from the prosecution_history and overly constrict the meaning of` body attaching means'
the trial_court gave undue_weight to statements during prosecution of the562_patent
the prior_art locked the rod inside an anchoring member with` at least one and preferably two additional locking elements'
to distinguish this prior_art the patentee characterized the prior_art system as requiring` at a minimum three distinct elements'
from these statements the trial_court concluded that an accused device would literally infringe the562_patent only if it used` less than three parts to attach the rod to the spine'
sofamor_danek_group 1994_wl_846541 at * 6
this history however merely distinguishes the claimed_invention from a prior_art reference with at least three parts
neither the specification nor the claims restrict the` body attaching means' to less than three parts
similarly the specification contains no language specifying that the` body attaching means' include two smooth- *1221 sided_branches as dictated by the trial_courts third numbered requirement

the parties also disputed the meaning of the` threaded_plug' limitation
the threaded_plug per the claim has a` face directed towards the rod said face being equipped with means for gripping and attaching the plug to the rod in a manner in which the rod will be clamped to prevent translation and rotation'
the trial_court found that the moss-miami threaded_plug does not penetrate the rod

depuy-motechs moss-miami_device uses a threaded_plug unlike the one in the562_patent
the face of the threaded inner plug in the moss-miami_device is smooth flat and reversible
unlike the562_patent ed_invention the moss-miami_device does not appear to grip and attach to the rod through the face of the inner screw

the evidence presented at the preliminary_injunction hearing is contradictory on this point however
dr. ashman sofamors expert testified that the threaded_plug penetrates the rod
mr. derner depuy-motechs expert testified that the moss-miami_device does not penetrate the rod but uses friction to keep the plug in place
the trial_court will have a full opportunity to resolve this factual dispute during trial

the trial_court properly determined that sofamor has not shown a reasonable_likelihood of success in proving that the moss-miami_device exactly embodies each claim_limitation or its equivalent
charles_greiner 962 f.2d at 1034
as such the courts constrained interpretation of the term` body attaching means' is harmless

under fed.r.civ.p
61 this court` disregard [ s ] any error or defect in the proceeding which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties'
fed.r.civ.p
61 ; see also richdel inc. v. sunspool corp. 714_f.2d_1573 1580 219_uspq_8 12 fed.cir.1983

moreover the trial_court has no obligation to interpret claim 1 conclusively and finally during a preliminary_injunction proceeding
under markman claim interpretation is a matter of law
markman 52 f.3d at 978
however markman does not obligate the trial judge to conclusively interpret claims at an early stage in a case
a trial_court may exercise its discretion to interpret the claims at a time when the parties have presented a full picture of the claimed_invention and prior_art
illinois tool works inc. v. grip-pak inc. 906_f.2d_679 681 15_uspq2d_1307 1309 fed.cir.1990 referring to a preliminary_injunction` hearing in which neither party was required to prove his case in full and in light of findings and conclusions not binding at trial'
( emphasis added ; atari games corp. v. nintendo of am. inc. 897_f.2d_1572 1575 14_uspq2d_1034 1036 fed.cir.1990` the district_court need not make binding findings of fact but at the very least must find probabilities that the necessary facts can be proved
`` ; black & decker inc. v. hoover serv
ctr. 886_f.2d_1285 1296_n._16 12_uspq2d_1250 1259_n._16_(fed.cir.1989)` decisions on preliminary relief do not preclude trial on the merits.. though preclusion may be appropriate when the evidence is the same..'

doctrine of equivalents
absent a finding of literal infringement the trial_court can find that an accused device infringes by applying the doctrine of equivalents
becton dickinson & co. v. c.r
bard inc. 922_f.2d_792 797-98 17_uspq2d_1097 1100-01 fed.cir.1990
an accused product that does not literally infringe a claim may infringe if it has insubstantial changes from the patented device
hilton_davis chem co. v. warner-jenkinson co. 62_f.3d_1512 1518-19 35_uspq2d_1641 1645-46 fed.cir.1995

to determine an equivalent under the doctrine the court examines the context of the patent the prior_art and the particular circumstances of the case
equivalence in the patent law is not the prisoner of a formula and is not an absolute to be considered in a vacuum.. an important factor is whether persons reasonably skilled in the art would have known of the interchangeability of an ingredient not contained in the patent with one that was
*1222 graver_tank & mfg co. v. linde air products co. 339_u.s._605 609 70_s.ct._854 856 94_l.ed._1097_(1950)
this court has recently acknowledged this principle
hilton_davis 62 f.3d at 1519

in examining the562_patent its prosecution_history and the prior_art the trial_court did not find a reasonable_likelihood of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
from the context of the patent the court described the562_patent ed_invention as follows [ i ] t allows the ease of loading a rod into the implant from a posterior direction and then permits the user to fix that rod in place using only one locking element
because the moss-miami_device requires the use of more than one element to lock the rod it can not be seen as stealing the benefit of the562_patent
sofamor_danek_group 1994_wl_846541 at *9

the trial_court used the three-pronged function-way-result_test fwr in graver_tank for its doctrine of equivalents analysis
this court has recently clarified en banc the proper application and context for this test
hilton_davis 62 f.3d at 1512
hilton_davis says it goes too far to describe that the function-way-result_test as` the test' for equivalents
hilton_davis 62 f.3d at 1518-19
evidence beyond function way and result informs application of the doctrine which focuses on the substantiality of changes from the claims in the accused device
id
one of ordinary skill in the relevant art provides the perspective for assessing the substantiality of differences between the claims and the accused device
id
`` the test is objective with proof of the substantiality of the differences resting on objective evidence'
id
this court commends for instance evidence that persons reasonably skilled in the art would have known of the interchangeability of an ingredient not contained in the patent with one that was
id
( citing graver_tank 339 u.s. at 609 70 s.ct.at 856-57
if the parties however presented primarily evidence of fwr this presentation may suffice to satisfy the doctrine of equivalents
id

sofamor did not show a reasonable_likelihood that the moss-miami_device infringed under the fwr test
as the trial_court noted` however because the moss-miami uses significantly different means to perform the body-attaching function it can not be found to perform insubstantially the same way
`` sofamor_danek_group 1994_wl_846541 at *10
in particular the trial_court focused the moss-miamis use of more than one element to lock the rod in place
similarly the trial_court determined that sofamor did not show a reasonable_likelihood that the moss-miami_device includes the claimed threaded_plug element

in addition prosecution_history and prior_art may limit sofamors assertion of a reasonable_likelihood that differences between the562_patent ed_invention and the moss-miami_device are insubstantial
prosecution history estoppel prevents a patentee from recapturing under the doctrine of equivalents claim scope surrendered during prosecution
exhibit supply co. v. ace patents corp. 315_u.s._126 136 62_s.ct._513 518-19 86_l.ed._736_(1942)
similarly a patentee may not assert a range of equivalents that captures art already in the public domain
wilson sporting goods co. v. david geoffrey & assocs. 904_f.2d_677 683 14_uspq2d_1942 1947 fed.cir
) cert
denied 498_u.s._992 111_s.ct._537 112_l.ed.2d_547_(1990)
for instance the trial_court properly noted that the562_patent strove to distinguish itself from prior_art with a` separate_locking_screw [ or external_nut ]'
u.s._patent_no._5005,062 col. 3 11
64-67
the moss-miami_device including its external_nut may fall within the scope of prior_art
thus these limitations on the doctrine of equivalents also may support the district_courts ruling that sofamor did not show a reasonable_likelihood of infringement

irreparable harm
the trial_court also found that sofamor did not show irreparable_harm
see reebok_int l 32 f.3d at 1555
sofamor instead relied on a presumption of irreparable_harm often invoked upon a clear showing of likelihood of success on patent_infringement and validity
*1223 see h.h
robertson 820 f.2d at 390
because sofamor did not show a clear case of likelihood of success on the merits however its failure to proffer evidence of irreparable_harm buttresses the trial_courts denial of sofamors motion

because sofamor showed neither a likelihood of success on the merits nor irreparable_harm the trial_court properly denied the motion for preliminary_injunction
any undue restraints on the interpretation of the562 claims were harmless misconstruances
the trial_court did not abuse its discretion
therefore this court affirms

costs
each party shall bear its own costs

affirmed
